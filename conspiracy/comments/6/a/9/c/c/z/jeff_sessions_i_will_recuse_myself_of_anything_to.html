<p>Another completely made up statement.  Flynn was never negotiating Russian sanctions with anyone.  He doesn&#39;t even have the power to lift sanctions, and neither does President Trump.  The sanctions currently in place against Russia were implemented by Congress, and only Congress can lift those sanctions.  </p>

<p>Dear Lord, can we PLEASE stop with this muh Russians narrative.  It is so played out, and insulting to say that the Russians somehow got Trump elected, rather then admitting the fact that the Democratic Party stole the nomination from Bernie Sanders, and ran a stinky, old, decrepit, witch.  Democrats could have run ANYONE else then Clinton and easily defeated Trump, but they didn&#39;t, and now they&#39;re so desperate to point the finger at anyone else but themselves, that they took off and ran with this nonsensical Russian narrative.    </p>

<p>This narrative is played out and over.  If Moscow can&#39;t hack the Frensh election, then there&#39;s no fucking way they could hack the USA&#39;s elections, which has 10x as many people.  It&#39;s not possible.  Drop it already.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re the one with inaccurate information. And Flynn isn&#39;t innocent. The official reason he was fired was that he &quot;lied to Pence&quot; about what he said to the Russians, and he told Pence he didn&#39;t talk to the Russians. But of course it was all BS, he was the fall guy plain and simple. If I knew what was going on with him accepting bribes just by reading the news, Pence surely knew that and more.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What bribes? What are you even talking about? I never said he was Innocent, in fact I do think he&#39;s guilty for not disclosing his business ties to Turkey, but let me ask you this question.</p>

<p>From the Sally Yates / Jim Clapper hearing yesterday, we found out that they were very concerned about Flynn even before Trump took office, and know about these ties as a foreign agent even, but yet the same intellence agency approved his super top secret security clearance?  If they truly were concerned for national security, how is it that he still got a top secret security clearance?  They knowingly gave someone who is potentially a foreign agent, which they admitted knowing before the inauguration yesterday the country&#39;s highest compartmentalized security clearance?  Doesn&#39;t add up at all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No I didn&#39;t, and would like to read more about it if you have a link handy, but if he&#39;s a private citizen at the time, then how is that really a problem?  Hillary Clinton also received $130 million dollars to her foundation from Russia, shortly after she approved selling 1/3 of the United States&#39;s entire uranium supply to Russian businessmen​, WHILE she was Secretary of State, and after she had just approved the sale.  </p>

<p>If she did this while employed as SoS, how is Flynn accepting money from RT as a private citizen illegal, or even a conflict of interest?</p>

<p>It is specifically a problem because he was a private citizen, anticipating being in a position later to help Putin, then trying to sell favorable policy for personal gain.  That is extremely illegal.</p>

<p>Negotiating a deal to sell a strategic resource with the approval of the government while acting as a government official is in no way illegal.  </p>

<p>How do you know what he was anticipating? How could he have even imagined in 2015 that he would even be a part of the Trump campaign, let alone be able to help Putin?  This is not based in fact at all.  There is no crime for accepting money from a foreign country, while a private citizen, unless there&#39;s a clear quid-pro-quo that was found, which this article doesn&#39;t even suggest.</p>

<p>Wait, what?!  lol, come on guy, the mental gymnastics you are taking to try and say that Hillary Clinton accepting $130 million dollars into her own Clinton Crime Family Fund, after just approving the sale of uranium is astonishing!  While again, we don&#39;t have proof of a quid-pro-quo, her accepting money to her own personal gain, from the same group of people who had just had requested approval for the sale, is much less ambiguous then what Flynn accepted money for.  </p>

<p>You really believe that it&#39;s ok for the Secretary of State to financially enrich themselve personally, to the tune of $130 million dollars, after just approving the sale of 1/3 of the United States&#39;s entire uranium supply is completely acceptable, and isn&#39;t a conflict of interest at all?  You&#39;re really going to stick with that statement?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right, but you&#39;re just speculating, you have no factual evidence supporting your claim that Flynn was secretly in contact with the Trump campaign.  </p>

<p>You also refuse to explain in detail how accepting money from a foreign government, as a private citizen, and a registered lobbyist is even illegal to begin with.  You do realize that is by it&#39;s definition what a lobbyist does, right?</p>

<p>Ok, that is your story and you are sticking to it, got it.  It&#39;s ok for Hillary Clinton to accept money to her families foundation that directly enriches herself, from not only a foreign government, but a foreign government who has business directly with her as Secretary of State, who after receiving the donation, approves the sale of 1/3 of the countries uranium to the same people who just donated $130 million dollars to her, but it&#39;s not ok for Michael Flynn to accept money from a foreign government when he&#39;s not even employed by the government, and is a private citizen at the time, with no clear quid-pro-quo identifiable.  </p>

<p>That may be the most asinine, partisan, hypocritical comment I have ever read on Reddit.  Please tell me you are joking, or concede at least that Hillary Clinton is as much in the wrong as Flynn is according to your own standards.  Please. </p>

<p>The Logan Act states:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Any citizen of the United States, wherever he may be, who, without authority of the United States, directly or indirectly commences or carries on any correspondence or intercourse with any foreign government or any officer or agent thereof, with intent to influence the measures or conduct of any foreign government or of any officer or agent thereof, in relation to any disputes or controversies with the United States, or to defeat the measures of the United States, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both.</p></li>
<li><p>This section shall not abridge the right of a citizen to apply himself, or his agent, to any foreign government, or the agents thereof, for redress of any injury which he may have sustained from such government or any of its agents or subjects. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>Which is still believing the mainstream media that the conversations were about lifting sanctions on Moscow.  Again, this doesn&#39;t seem to make sense, because again, Congress enacted the sanctions against the Russians, Congress, and only Congress can vote to lift those sanctions, not the White House.</p>

<p>What is the most alarming thing about General Flynn I&#39;ve seen, is the leak of unmasked raw sigint data of an American citizen from the NSA, to the Obama White House, then to multiple mainstream media outlets (likely done by Susan Rice).</p>

<p>The mainstream media was reporting from highly classified intercepts, which aren&#39;t supposed to be openly available to the White House, especially when they&#39;re targeting their political enemies, that&#39;s a felony and likely violated his human rights as well.  </p>

<p>James Comey sided with Sally Yates and James Clapper, choosing to chase the Russian fairies and unicorns narrative, and using &quot;prosecutorial discretion&quot; to not investigate the leak to begin with.  That&#39;s why he lost his job today.  Jeff Sessions is about to bring the word Justice back in style.  </p>
