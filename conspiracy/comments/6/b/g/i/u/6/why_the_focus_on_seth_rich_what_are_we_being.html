<p>13 posts on front page of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> are all the same exact story of Seth Rich.</p>

<p>It seems that people are pushing this hard. Question is are all these posts trying to distract from something else going on in the world today. Anyone see any small news or something unnoticed that this could be drawing attention from.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay riddle me this then, why would the DNC kill him for leaking emails then? Why would they not just have him arrested or fire him? Why is their immediate solution &quot;better murder him and cover it up, surely this will solve this problem&quot;? If he had dirt on them for them to kill him, why would he not just release it along with the 20,000 emails? Also, if it was because the DNC was trying to push a &quot;it was Russia&quot; agenda, why did they wait to do it until AFTER the election then? Obama literally withheld that information until after the election. None of the logic behind your conspiracy theory makes any sense to me at all. </p>

<p>Guy leaks stuff, it hurts the campaign. Kill the guy make it obvious it was not a robbery. Scare any potential leakers, they decide not to leak. Your party controls the Washington DC police and the FBI, just cover it up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>More than one person working for the Democratic party knew that  party leadership was favoring the Hillary wing. I am sure that most of people working in Democratic Party offices there believed they work for the Democratic Party, not the Hillary Party. Not everyone working there was a Hillary loyalist and Bernie hater. </p>

<p>People working in Washington read the Washington Post and they all saw and talked about how a co-worker was straight-out MURDERED. Some of them knew it was same guy who, one month before that, was in meetings complaining about how the primary process was favoring Hillary in more ways than one. </p>

<p>People talk and rumors spread quickly. If Seth Rich was my partner in sneaking data out of the office, you had better bet I would think twice before leaking anything else. </p>

<p>(There is a court case right now where the lawyer for the DNC basically admitted that the &quot;PRIVATE&quot; democratic party can choose a  leader in a back room if they feel like it.)  </p>

That man almost single handedly cost them the election yet he is walking around still very much alive... and yet we are also meant to believe that some junior staffer who may or may NOT have been behind the email leaks is killed AFTER they are already out and the damage is done?</p>
