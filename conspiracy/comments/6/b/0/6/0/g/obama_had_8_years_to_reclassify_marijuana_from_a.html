    <div class="md"><p>Yeah.  From wikipedia:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Air America was an American passenger and cargo airline covertly owned by the US government in 1950 as a dummy corporation for Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) operations in China. The CIA did not have enough work to keep the asset afloat and the National Security Council farmed the airline out to various government entities that included the USAF, US Army, USAID and for a brief time France. Essentially, Air America was used by the US government covertly to conduct military operations, posing as a civilian air carrier, in areas the US armed forces could not go due to treaty restraints contained in the 1954 and 1962 Geneva Accords.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Except for the name, there was nothing domestic about this airline.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They meant that the CIA runs drugs to fund covert operations, not that they make money from federal funding.  Air America was a well known heroin transport line out of Laos and Cambodia; try somewhere other than Wikipedia.</p>

<p>And FYI, the war on drugs is fought overseas as well as at home.  And yes, the CIA receives federal funds to combat cartels overseas in the war on drugs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>None of which matters, because reclassifying drugs here has nothing to do with what the CIA does in other countries.  Here, the supposed reason for enforcing any drug law is public safety.  But we don&#39;t give a shit about public safety in other countries.  In the places where we fight drug cartels overseas it&#39;s because their profits are used to fund wars, terrorism, destabilize governments that are friendly to us in favor of governments that are friendly to them, and buy weapons that are used to kill massive numbers of people. </p>

<p>We can make pot 100% legal here and still be justified in chasing down cartels around the world who are growing or selling it.  </p>

<p>So again, domestic policy on pot has NOTHING to do with the CIA.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So if we make pot (or all drugs) completely legal here, who will they sell it too?  Aren&#39;t we the biggest consumer of contraband?  Or anything for that matter?  </p>

<p>I agree that many signs point to some kind of conspiracy which sects of the CIA almost certainly have a hand in to keep drugs illegal here with the bonus that the CIA gets which is 
 A) continue the prison/industrial complex domestically 
B) Keep much of central/South America destabilized and hence not a threat/easy to control and sway.<br/>
The warlords and drug cartels that run central/South America aren&#39;t being taken down for a reason, and I highly doubt that reason is we haven&#39;t found them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bring on yet another set of downvotes for this comment, maybe even a ban.  But it&#39;s the truth, and has to be said:</p>

<p>Everyone who keeps saying &quot;drugs&quot; instead of &quot;pot&quot; is a fucking moron.  This is all within the context of why marijuana wasn&#39;t rescheduled, and the distinction is important.  Everyone who keeps making the argument you just made, or downvoting me because they are thinking it, is a moron.  The CIA doesn&#39;t profit from the prison industrial complex.  They don&#39;t own any, not even through shadow companies.  The money trail has been pretty thoroughly researched and documented in this area because our for-profit prison system is scandalous enough on it&#39;s own.  And anyone who thinks central and south american pot is a money source for the CIA has never bought any, at least not in the last 20 years or so.</p>

<p>The weed that comes from there is &quot;brick weed&quot; and it&#39;s the nastiest thing you used to be able to find.  I couldn&#39;t get any now if I tried, because no one wants it anymore.  About 20 years ago it was the weed of last resort.  But what everyone wanted was kb from Canada.  And that&#39;s what people have been buying for 20 years.  Brick weed has faded, and Canadian pot has faded, because we are now able to get domestically grown weed of better quality without the risks of crossing the border with customs.  Anything grown outside of the country is no longer worth the risk, and that&#39;s been the case for at least the last 5 years.  There can&#39;t be any CIA conspiracy because the simple facts of the way the world has changed means the CIA couldn&#39;t have any interest in the domestic pot market anyway.  </p>

<p>IF there is a conspiracy here, it&#39;s between the police unions/for-profit prison system and Obama.  But I think there would be enough interaction there that it would have been easy to follow.  IF there is a conspiracy, it does not involve the CIA.</p>

If they profit from pot at all, it&#39;s from it&#39;s production and sale, not arresting people.

    <div class="md"><p>What do yu think they are profiting off of?  The pot?  If you think that, you never buy any.  Shitty brick weed is all that gets imported from anywhere but Canada.  It is the weed of last resort.  And the cheapest shit there is.  The stuff people pay for, or used to, came from Canada, but I say used to, because that is being rapidly replaced by stuff sold here, since it&#39;s much easier to cross state borders than national ones.</p>

<p>Anyone who actually smoked pot knows the only way any federal agency could possibly have been profiting off of it for at least one, maybe two decades, is if they were operating a growery in canada, and that even if that was the case, that time has come and gone, unless the DEA can quadruple their budget so they can have the manpower to enforce the law in the states that have legalized it.   </p>

<p>And it&#39;s important to note, no matter what party your representative is a member of, it can&#39;t happen.  More than half of the U.S. has legalized some form of marijuana,  but the current classification is for drugs that are dangerous (lol) and have no medicinal use.  So most representatives can&#39;t vote to help the DEA without losing their jobs because their state has already voted in at least a minimum amount of support for some level of pot usage.  </p>

<p>Even if all the downvoters were right at some point in history, times have changed, and they changed before Obama took office.  This isn&#39;t a conspiracy.</p>

<p>The insurance companies did that. The ACA slowed it down. </p>

<p>That&#39;s not how the ACA works. Those subsidies (tax credits) come from taxes. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>...................</p>

<p>No</p>

<p>The entire point of feudalism is that you take the ruling class, and smash it into pieces.  Serfs answer to &#39;lords&#39; (historically, a variety of titles were used), and lords answer to some sort of monarch, or royal court.  If you have a larger population, then some of the lords become middlemen - serfs will answer directly to someone like a baron, while a series of barons amswers to the lord.  Feudalism is all about giving the people an immediate regional representative</p>

<p>This representation is imitated with the US congress, but it&#39;s a hollow imitation, because there is no contract between lord and vassal</p>

<p>Feudalism worled for thousands of years because of the feudal contract, where lord and vassal both agree on their responsibilities and obligations to each other</p>

<p>What we have now is a ruling class.  They aren&#39;t actually bound by anything to do what we want - hence the endless war in the east, the drug war, income inequality, private healthcare, etc</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Feudalism is literally the precursor to capitalism. With the death of manorialism in 16th century England, the feudal system evolved into agrarian capitalism which was then replaced by mercantilism during the age of discovery. In the mid 18th century the system shifted to industrial capitalism which led to our modern system of capitalism; the most dominant economic system for over a century, spread via globalization.</p>

<p>All of the problems we face with the aristocracy under capitalism are also present with the aristocracy under feudalism. If you think that becoming a serf will free you from the rich elite all you are going to get is a jew banker dick right up your ass.</p>

<p>Colorado: A <strong>private</strong> company made a mistake. No one gave illegal aliens the right to vote. </p>

<p>Oregon: I didn&#39;t realize boarding a plane was literally voting. Because that is all they discussed. Voting wasn&#39;t even mentioned. </p>

<p>California: Again, nothing to do with voting. This is a problem with the TSA that the writer kept trying to, weakly, tie to voting. </p>

<p>This whole paper is an opinion piece trying to pass as a fact. </p>

<p>This might have had more merit if it wasn&#39;t for the President of the United States granting amnesty. They are no longer considered illegal. <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-voter-husband-deported_us_58d4b262e4b02a2eaab244cd">Just like how hard working Americans can now be considered illegal by President Trump</a>.

<p>This is, unfortunately for you, hearsay. It is literally &quot;this is what Napolitano said&quot; with no reporting or investigative journalism. Now if it did do those two things, it would have been a credible source. But alas, it is just a talking piece. </p>

<p>Opinion piece trying to pass off as news. This might actually qualify as fake news but I don&#39;t care to make such a distinction. There are a lot of unverified claims. In fact this line from the article:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;In terms of a check and balance that would prevent an individual who is a non U.S. citizen from registering to vote, that doesn&#39;t exist.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is a complete lie. Legal residents of the United States have the right to vote. </p>

<p>Now I have no problem with these opinion pieces, but they are just that, opinions. I am sorry but if you consider this proof. Actual verifiable proof should have long swayed you that the Republicans have been practicing voter suppression, along with other atrocities committed by Republicans. </p>

<p>I&#39;m sure the self-righteousness of standing up for the oppressed feels good to you but, this is how the &quot;oppressed&quot; actually feel about voter ID laws:</p>

Go away and come back when you have something meaningful to say.</p>

<p><a href="http://time.com/4449322/hillary-clinton-marijuana-schedule-dea/"><strong><em>Hillary Clinton Campaign Says She Would Reschedule Marijuana</em></strong></a></p>
</blockquote>

<h2></h2>

<blockquote>
<p>The DEA&#39;s decision to keep pot as a Schedule I drug affirmed the federal government&#39;s belief that there is insufficient evidence to show that any &quot;specific benefits&quot; the drug might offer would outweigh any of the &quot;known risks.&quot;</p>

<p><strong><em>Clinton, however, seems to disagree and the campaign contended that if elected, she would reclassify the drug to a Schedule II substance, which would mean acceptance that marijuana has a medical use for treatment.“</em></strong> As president, Hillary will build on the important steps announced today by rescheduling marijuana from a Schedule I to a Schedule II substance. She will also ensure Colorado, and other states that have enacted marijuana laws, can continue to serve as laboratories of democracy,&quot; Harris continued.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I would say if you are 60% or more BLACK, then you are black.  The closer you get to 100%, the more you will have fully black features, culminating with 100% itself, being a full blooded black.  You could draw the line for BLACK as far back as 51% if you really wanted to, though I think that is disingenuous</p>

<p>50-59% I would say is &quot;mixed&quot;.  There are words for it; but for some reason they are all considered &quot;offensive&quot;, so I won&#39;t be posting them here.  Again, you could draw the line for BLACK at 51% if want, but I think that is disingenuous</p>

<p>Less than 50% is not black, for obvious reasons.  Someone with a decent % of black blood under 50% would be a mixed, but majority non black</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe you should research why instead of asking me. There&#39;s alot more to that question than you think. History shows migrants haven&#39;t always had it easier than blacks, and slavery didn&#39;t help blacks. Neither did Jim Crow. Blacks didn&#39;t have many rights until the 1950&#39;s and even then still were denied alot of opportunities. Also, modern migrants may have access to foreign scholarships like CAMP (college assistance migrant program). </p>

<p>But just to end this argument, I&#39;ll just let you have your point. Blacks are stupid monkeys who can&#39;t read and commit crime and white are super awesome high IQ tax paying perfect people. There.  Happy?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I admit I was much less educated about this until you asked, there have been a few bills presented - 2011, 2012, and 2015.  Only the 2012 bill made it to congress, but clearly died.  It was reintroduced twice apparently, dying quickly each time.  I&#39;d love to see the votes on that, while I&#39;m sure Republicans voted against more often, I&#39;m sure plenty of Democrats voted against it too.</p>

<p>Anyways my basic opinion is that both parties are heavily lobbied by big pharma, who have good financial incentive to keep marijuana illegal.  The DEA is essentially non-partisan, and they recently reviewed the scheduling of marijuana and concluded it belongs as Schedule I.  They said there was no evidence of any medicinal benefit...  what the fuck!  There are literally mountains of evidence!  More than they can provide for many prescription drugs /rant</p>

<p>Quick google search turned up <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Removal_of_cannabis_from_Schedule_I_of_the_Controlled_Substances_Act">this wikipedia page</a> which included these notes (add &#39;#2016&#39; to the end of the main wikipedia page url to go to this section):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>2016[edit]
In August 2016, the DEA rejected calls to reschedule marijuana, but indicated an increase in availability for research.[68]
The 2016 platform of the Democratic Party called for removal of marijuana from Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act, &quot;providing a reasoned pathway for future legalization&quot; of marijuana.[69] This language was approved in a close vote (81-80 vote) in the platform committee.[70]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Followed by:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>2017 bill[edit]
In April 2017, Matt Gaetz, a Florida Republican, cosponsored House Resolution 2020 to move cannabis to Schedule III.[71][72]</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/apr/8/bipartisan-bill-would-rescheduled-marijuana-schedu/">Washington Times article</a> on House Bill 2020 and the <a href="http://www.thecannabist.co/2017/04/07/marijuana-federal-rescheduling-schedule-i/76885/">Denver Post</a> article.</p>

<p>So there is growing bipartisan support, but I seriously doubt it&#39;ll go anywhere.  It&#39;s important to remember these decisions aren&#39;t up to the president, he gets to sign or veto after the fact.  So while sure, Democrats seem more open to legalization, they aren&#39;t 100%.  I seriously doubt Hillary would have legalized it, Bernie would have but then again he wasn&#39;t really a democrat.</p>

<p>Ya, that&#39;s cause there isn&#39;t any. Well, at least in their studies, which are all obfuscated to look that way.</p>

<p>They create dozens if not hundreds of tests to get the results they want, then throw out the rest and only use the ones that show the desired results. So ya, according to them there is no benefits. </p>

<p>But they are also the party of JC and his whole &quot;heal the sick and help the needy&quot; shtick... I&#39;m too confused about what they actually believe to ever vote for one.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s the beauty of secularism, religion doesn&#39;t make laws.  And the GOP is not a homogeneous religon, they are however (supposedly) all united in their desire for smaller government.  To argue against political policy because of someone&#39;s religion isn&#39;t very progressive.</p>

<p>Pro-life because babies are innocent. Pro-death because adults are supposed to know the consequences of their actions and take responsibility for them.  If you rape and murder you&#39;ve given up your right to exist.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not a Republican, registered Dem, and not religious by any stretch of the imagination.  But the two party system blinds people from the legitimate concerns of their fellow Americans.  Why are your views more important than theirs?</p>

I understand that small government is the (R) calling card but too many rightwing law makers want their sky fairies rules to govern all of us.</p>

<p>I thought babies are born with original sin... but still innocent?  More hypocrisy.  Also, all means all, not who we think is precious.</p>

<p>I would argue vegans put less value on human life than animals and there is no hypocrisy there.  Women fighting for the hijab seems like brainwashing to me... they don&#39;t know any other existence.</p>

<p>Vegans putting more value on animal lives is the hypocrisy. All living creatures are supposed to be precious aren&#39;t they, including human lives?</p>

I&#39;ve never voted Republican in my life, but I&#39;ve found myself more and more disenfranchised from the Democrats lately, especially after the primaries.  Again, thank you for the information.

    <div class="md"><p>If I could give you a bit of advice;  Don&#39;t form your opinion using media, especially bullshit (news) that you find in this sub.  Find certain topics that are important to you and be mindful of bias while doing so.  It&#39;s going to take a couple of sources, but you&#39;ll end up finding places where you can reliably trust their judgement and reasoning in the future.  </p>

<p>So once you&#39;ve identified topics that are important to you, start researching how the parties vote.  Using their actions, you can come to a reasonably informed opinion on the differences between the parties.  They are quite pronounced on some issues and while the prevailing thought on this sub is that they&#39;re equally bad... that can only by said by those ignorant of party line votes.</p>

<p>I say all of this as a Libertarian who is leaning a bit to the Left.  I specify that I&#39;m leaning Left due to inadequacies in the Libertarian&#39;s fiscal platform when it comes to automation and their views on future fiscal policy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Literally the only stance that divides the two parties, at least among voter registration, is abortion. I&#39;ve petitioned for signatures before for getting 3rd party candidates ballot access in the general election, and that&#39;s the only issue anyone cared about. They&#39;re both pro-war, they&#39;re both against self-ownership, they&#39;re both fiscally insolvent, ...</p>

<p>It really bugged me that people only cared about abortion, especially since a wrong answer equaled no signature, meaning they don&#39;t even want to give you a chance on the ballot. Doesn&#39;t matter if you agree on 90% of other issues, even more so than either major party&#39;s candidate. They just care about abortion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The single issue voter like pro-choice / anti-abortion are part of the reason why it&#39;s so hard to break out of the 2 party system. But it doesn&#39;t mean they are the same. Democrats would not be trying to take away health care from 24 Million americans now. Democrats would not be trying to cut taxes for the top 1%. Democrats would not be trying to kill the EPA, pollute our rivers and streams to make corporations just a little richer.</p>

<p>Yes, the 2 party system sucks and it&#39;s a false choice, but they are not the same.</p>

<p>So Clinton fully supporting the &#39;94 crime bill, voted for the Iraq War, subverted our democracy, cheated progressives, defrauded Bernie supporters out of $200 million, etc. <strong><em>Those are your values?

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, now I definitely don&#39;t believe you are what you say you are.  Either that or t_D has warped your thought process.  Obama via Holder had just as much ability to prioritize enforcement of substances banned by the CSA as Trump via Sessions.  It&#39;s called enforcement discretion.  Obama used it to help users and Trump is using it to hurt them.  Democrats and Republicans made mandatory minimum sentencing worse on drugs.  There&#39;s literally no difference there.  The only difference is Democrats have been working to relax those laws as of late and Republicans are bringing them back.  I would trust them to do something better because they have been doing something better.  Wow have they got you turned around. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I cast my vote in Iowa so it honestly didn&#39;t make any difference who I voted for.</p>

<p>What I did <em>try</em> to do was warn Clinton supporters that she was a liability. Democrats didn&#39;t want to hold her or the DNC accountable for their actions though. I wonder if they have cognitive dissonance for not listening to our warnings.</p>

<p>You wouldn&#39;t be commenting today about this if Democrats didn&#39;t subvert our democracy and defraud Bernie supporters out of over $200 million. You&#39;d be thanking &quot;President Sanders&quot; for what he had already accomplished :) After all, he was the highest polling candidate in the general election. I don&#39;t fucking know why the most popular candidates in our country aren&#39;t allowed to be on the ballot. It doesn&#39;t make much sense.</p>

<p>Fuck FPTP. We need scored ballots. Anyway I will GLADLY support Dems again if they:</p>

<ul>
<li>Issue a formal apology for the rigging of the 2016 primaries + defrauding us out of over $200 million this apology can also come in the form of $$ ;) <a href="https://www.facebook.com/DNCfraudlawsuit/">https://www.facebook.com/DNCfraudlawsuit/</a></li>
<li>Somehow promise and ensure that our primaries won&#39;t be rigged again moving forward</li>
<li>Adopt ending FPTP into their party platform in favor of scored (or approval/ranked) ballots</li>
</ul>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I gotta head off to bed, but I&#39;ll end by saying that once again, I do agree that what the DNC did with Clinton was complete bullshit (&quot;But it was her turn!&quot; as they kept saying, lol) and as a result they ostracised a large number of their supporters such as yourself who are now so bitter about what they did that you&#39;re literally willing to watch an overgrown manchild slowly tear your country apart from the inside. </p>

<p>That&#39;s not a shot at you by the way, it&#39;s fair enough if you&#39;re upset, but it&#39;s kinda messed up that there is still almost 4 years of Trump to go in the Whitehouse. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As a progressive I value my ability to influence politics through democracy much more than small progressive wins we are &quot;given&quot; by the elite few who control our elections.</p>

<p>Our grassroots movement made Bernie the most popular general election candidate available among ALL voters (not just Democrats). If our democratic process actually represented the people, Bernie would have been on that ballot and we wouldn&#39;t be bitching about Trump right now. He&#39;d probably be off making a new TV show or something.</p>

<p>For how high and mighty and triggered you became, this sure was easy.</p>

He&#39;s the first black pres man, and one who was very conscious of this image, I honestly never saw him legalizing weed, but he did change course with enforcement in his second term and finally conceded the point. Look at how much progress legalization had made in the last eight years - you can knock him for not being hpbehind it but you&#39;ve also got to give him credit for letting the states do their own thing and taking a step back.

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;The Trump administration is going to put people in jail for as long as possible. This is terrible!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh yeah, well Obama didn&#39;t legalize marijuana.&quot;</p>

<p>No shit. But what the Trump administration is doing is reversing an Obama-era action to lower penalties on drug offenses. So it turns out that Obama took a positive action and Trump is reversing it. Obama was moving in a good direction, Trump is moving in a bad direction. And you&#39;re talking about how bad Obama was. Well let me tell you what your god emperor is doing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re right, it&#39;s not only marijuana, it&#39;s all drugs. This is a 2013 directive, telling prosecutors to avoid charging offenses that would trigger minimum sentences in case the defendant is not violent or a criminal:</p>

<p><a href="http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/HolderMandatoryMinimumsMemo.pdf">http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/HolderMandatoryMinimumsMemo.pdf</a></p>

<p>This is one of the two directives mentioned explicitly in Sessions&#39; new &quot;put as many people in jail as possible&quot; policy, in a footnote in the second page:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Look, at least these politicians are trying to make lives better for the slaves. It&#39;s not perfect but it&#39;s progress.&quot;</p>

<p>This is the exact same. Sometimes there is right or wrong. I bet if Obama was the guy in my fabricated quote above people from /all would still be all over his dick.</p>

<p>Tell me again how Democrats have good judgment and human compassion please. You guys can repeat &quot;he did more than Republicans&quot; all you want but that did fuck all for the people rotting their lives away in prison for nonviolent crimes.</p>

<p>Big Billy Clinton signed the &#39;94 Crime Bill that disproportionately harmed minorities and caused many of those non violent criminals to be there in the first place. Anybody that tries to counter this with &quot;oh but the black caucus supported it&quot; can fuck off as well. Have we not already seen how many times politicians do something terrible under the guise of something good? e.g. The PATRIOT Act, Iraq War, Vietnam, drug war, etc.</p>

<p>Sometimes in hindsight you can see what mistakes you&#39;ve made. Hillary had to speak a lot about hindsight. Personally I see &quot;hindsight&quot; as just another way to get out of any real responsibility.</p>

<p>Some examples: Clinton did not support gay marriage until it no longer mattered politically, supported the Iraq War, supported unconstitutional spying, would have continued rotting away prisoners lives for nonviolent crimes, stored SAP docs on a private email server less secure than a public Gmail account, she cosponsored the Flag Protection Act of 2005, she fully supported the &#39;94 Crime Bill, her husband who she constantly defended signed the Telecommunications Act of 1996, I think my point is made).</p>

<p>That&#39;s why Bernie&#39;s campaign did so well, because he had good <em>foresight</em>. In most of the big Democrat screw ups you can find a video of Sanders warning the country about what was going to happen. His campaign did quite well except for the fact that Clinton and the DNC lied to Americans, subverted our democracy and defrauded us out of over $200 million.</p>

<p><strong>I love that everyone from /all keeps saying &quot;now is the time to unite against Trump&quot;. Well, <em>we already fucking did that</em>, and they cheated the American people. We had a strong grassroots movement in Sanders but Dems cheated him. He was the highest polling candidate in the general election so why the fuck wasn&#39;t he on the ballot?</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Obama&#39;s actions leaves the door open for Republican abuse, which in turn inspires voters to vote democrat.  It&#39;s literally a strategical move at the expense of the voters.  If Obama descheduled Marijuana, Trump rescheduling it would be a disaster and he couldn&#39;t do it.  But instead using the dangerous policy of selective enforcement, Trump can come in and selectively enforce and piss just enough people off to vote democrat in 2020 or 2024.</p>

<p>So yes, I am going to blame Obama for not getting it right.  Both parties suck and trying to compare them is like trying to decide your lunch is going to be a douchebag or a turd sandwich.</p>

<p>It was within his power.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The president doesn&#39;t have the power to reclassify drugs. There are only two ways to do that. Either through congress, or through the AG.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2015/02/13/how-to-reschedule-marijuana-and-why-its-unlikely-anytime-soon/">https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2015/02/13/how-to-reschedule-marijuana-and-why-its-unlikely-anytime-soon/</a></p>

<p>There were several petitions during Obama&#39;s terms send to the AG and all of them ended up in front of a court. The last one in 2013. The court ruled that marijuana has no accepted medical use and therefore will remain under Schedule 1. As long as this ruling stands, and this is not something the president can change, there will be no reclassification (unless you bring the congress together to write a pro-marijuana law).</p>

<p>This is also a catch-22. Marijuana is a Schedule 1 drug and therefore you can&#39;t really do research on it. Without research you can&#39;t show possible medical treatments. And without that it will be hard to give evidence to a court to overrule the standing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i dont smoke it.... i make a tea with it. from what i can see its not harmful. all studies i have read suggest its not actually harmful and may actually be very beneficial. to be clear i have also read studies that suggest it could be harmful but so far only if smoked. I agree that anything &quot;smoked&quot; must be harmful in one way or another. </p>

<p>the one thing that winds me up is why its illegal  though. are they trying to protect my health? why do they care? i can buy bleach and down the bottle... i can buy a pen ad shove it in my eye.... wheres the line? why do they care??? they dont! the only thing i can see is that more studies prove its beneficial factors and it being a free plant is not good for some powerful businesses. it seems more of a power move than a health move in the legalization factor.  </p>

<p>since the internet and free speech is increasing i imagine it will be impossible to stop the legalization eventually.</p>

<p>i am of the view that all drugs should be legalized...  educate people of the harm and benefits of all drugs and let the adult make their own mind up of whether they want it or not. who am i or u, to tell another human being they cant put &quot;that&quot; in their body!?!?! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>While I agree with your sentiment this is slightly untrue. Marjiuana became illegal in the 1930&#39;s, not in 1965 when LBJ began his &quot;war on crime.&quot; The timing was connected to two things: the end of prohibition of alcohol (1933), and the influx of Mexican citizens following the Mexican Revolution (early 1900&#39;s, 1910-1920ish).</p>

<p>Harry S. Anslinger was the man in charge of the bureau of prohibition  when it came time for prohibition to end, and he quickly realized his job was about to not exist anymore. So he started investigating. My memory is slightly failing me on exact numbers but I believe he had 31 scientists research marijuana to find if it was harmful. About of those ~31, only 2 came to the conclusion it was harmful. Harry S. Anslinger used the opinion of those two scientists to convince congress that marijuana needed to be illegal.</p>

<p>There was a huge racist element to it. This is actually when &quot;marjiuana&quot; &#39;became a common term for cannabis, this was done intentionally so people would associate it with the Mexican citizens who already had a negative stigma in the eyes of many Americans. Look up some quotes from Harry S. Anslinger, there would be large scale public outcry today if a politican/public servant said even as close to the openly racist shit that came out of his mouth. One of the most shocking things being he claimed that black men used marijuana to give to white women so they can sleep with them. </p>

<p>Sorry for the novel but this is important to talk about because we are still enforcing a law created by an openly racist and vile man, I don&#39;t understand how people can claim that marijuana is illegal because it&#39;s dangerous. No, marijuana prohibition is rooted in racism, straight from the mouth of the man who created it. Of course LBJ and Nixon are both guilty of using marijuana prohibition to lock up civil rights activists, hippies and protest leaders but the true roots of its illegalization is a different kind of sinister. I would encourage everyone to read more into this time period and how the government managed to manipulate and change the population&#39;s view of marijuana so quickly. It&#39;s very interesting.</p>

<p>Stay high my friends!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for the extra information. I guess I got confused with Nixon&#39;s use of the illegality of the drug to target minorities, thinking that he was the one who made it illegal, when he was just giving it a bigger platform. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll look more in to Anslinger. Thanks for the heads up, I&#39;ve been really looking closer at this sort of thing and each time you think you&#39;ve discovered the extent of the evil, you open another can of worms and see how much deeper the rot goes. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was illegalised for many reasons. I&#39;ve since learnt I was wrong about what I said (see the other reply to my comment). I suppose what I should have said is that the War on Drugs was  used to drive the system of mass incarceration and oppress minorities (especially black Americans). </p>

<p>I still believe that racism was a big factor in it&#39;s prohibition, but I&#39;m sure you&#39;re certainly right about the rest of it. I think the main thing is at the end of the day, it was all about corporate interests, and money. I&#39;m sure they would have done it to white people too if they could have gotten away with it</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Happy to share my method of weed tea making dude:</p>

<p>1) get some butter (anything fatty will do as thc is not soluble in water). i like to use around two tea spoons worth and stick it in a pan
2) grind some bud (i do between 0.25 and 0.5 grams at a time and mix it with the butter. If feeling lazy can just heat up the butter in the pan and pour in your ground weed
3) put in water, a couple of cups worth as it will evaporate. bring to boil then turn down heat to simmer
4) simmer for 45m to 1hr and top up water every 15m. </p>

<p>done! add tea bags for flavor if you like or drink as is 
Can filter the bits out with a strainer if you want (i dont bother). the juice now contains all the dissolved thc :)</p>

Because we live in a country with increasing social benefits and governmental assistance; legalizing drugs will only increase the amount of people utilizing these services.

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s just not true. There have been multiple long-term studies that confirmed that regular use of marijuana that began before the brain fully matured impacted intellectual development, resulting in adults with lowered cognitive capacity, slower thought processes, and lowered overall IQ.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your ingesting of something that impairs mental function makes you a danger to yourself and others. If you secluded yourself to a desert island, then sure, heroin it up. But while you live in a society where your actions affect more then yourself, you have a certain responsibility to notake poor decisions. </p>

<p>There is no excuse for someone on a bender to take up a hospital bed that could be better used to care for someone who fell ill, or suffered an accident, or some such. </p>

<p>And yes, weed does make you stupid and slow. It lowers your cognitive capacity significantly while the drug is in your system. Don&#39;t believe me, fine. It&#39;s easy to test. Grab a fifth grade math workbook, and try solving the problems whole sober. Then get high and try again. You&#39;ll notice the difference eventually, once enough of the drug has left your system for your brain to recover enough function to notice. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s the thing Mr. Smartypants, I&#39;m an engineering student who does far beyond the average 5th grade math problem on a fairly consistent basis. To take things further, you openly admitted to never ingesting drugs yet go on to describe what it will concretely do to someone who has. It would seem as if you have no idea what you&#39;re talking about seeing as how you already predicated your entire statement with the fact that you have no first hand experience with the effects of drugs. You can sit here and tell me that someone in your family is why you are so against drugs. Sorry, it wasn&#39;t the drugs that made uncle Billy a failure, its Billy.</p>

<p>&quot;Your ingesting of something that impairs mental function makes you a danger to yourself and others...while you live in a society where your actions affect more then yourself, you have a certain responsibility to notake poor decisions.&quot; </p>

<p>That is the most vague and generalized excuse for an argument I have ever read. Hyperbole. Woah. Digression. Anyways, if you are going to provide such a broad idea, you better back it up with more than people taking up hospital beds. This implies you believe all people who ingest things you don&#39;t think they should are in the hospital and that there is some shortage-of-hospital-beds pandemic sweeping the world. This is comical and most undoubtedly false.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll let you in on a little secret here, video games, tv screens, and frequenting r/conspiracy are all bad for your health and affects people beyond you. </p>

<p>Before you go telling others how bad things are for them, ask yourself, &quot;Do I even eat that healthy or live an active lifestyle?&quot; </p>

<p>Stop telling people what they can put in their bodies, thanks! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Weed does not make you stupid or slow. You also just stated you don&#39;t use it so how can you make such a broad generalization like that? My friend is a aquatic engineer who designs underwater pipelines for major corporations and he&#39;s been smoking weed since he was a teenager, and there are plenty of people in other fields of occupation just like him. Just because some people who smoke weed aren&#39;t as intelligent as others doesn&#39;t mean weed is the reason. Soda and fried food makes people fat too right? I drink soda often and I love fried chicken and I don&#39;t have diabetes nor am I even close to being overweight. Marijuana can be harmful and can impair early brain development but to say it makes people slow and stupid is downright incorrect. You seem to think you&#39;re intelligent, so, maybe you should try it and see if it makes you stupid, before you outright bash it by regurgitating something you read or heard elsewhere. </p>

<p>The findings of this early study suggest that regular marijuana smoking results in symptoms similar to that of tobacco smoking with an increased incidence of chronic cough, sputum production, wheeze and episodes of acute bronchitis. These results have been replicated in subsequent longitudinal studies involving random or selected samples of populations in the USA.[4,15] Importantly, significant symptoms were reported with less than one marijuana cigarette smoked per day on average.[15] This suggests that respiratory symptoms can occur with fewer marijuana cigarettes than with tobacco cigarettes. This again may be related to the way marijuana is rolled and smoked. </p>

Hey,  what were you saying about harmful?<br/>
Science says that 80% or so people with seizure issues, find relief from cannabis. Regular weed has worked well for me for 20 years, without being particular about seeking out cbd. Thc works fine for me too. Huh.<br/>
Anyway, I haven&#39;t been roughed up by the cops in over 20 years. I feel less harmed. Purely anecdotal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol no withdrawal, you&#39;ve clearly never smoked weed. There is a withdrawl process. </p>

<p>After quitting you start to get your REM sleep stage back, which allows you to have dreams again. As your body rids its self of the THC metabolites in your blood you can have headaches and have even fuzzier memory than when you smoked. The insomnia starts going away after a week, along with the night sweats from your body detoxing. </p>

<p>After two weeks, your appetite begins to normalize, and lung function improves significantly. After three weeks, the full effects of lethargy, which is often mistaken as depression by pot smokers is almost gone, along with anxiety of not smoking.</p>

<p>So please, tell me more about there being no side effects of smoking weed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>At the risk of me regressing to a middle schooler, let me actually make the correction:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Here come all the posers</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because tbh with you, there&#39;s not a person I know (including myself a few years ago) who was a daily smoker who would argue that marijuana is addictive. It&#39;s like cigarettes except that most people who smoke weed don&#39;t smoke it as people who smoke tobacco smoke tobacco. </p>

<p>You smoke weed on the daily: you get addicted. Not mentally, physically. You may not realize it at first but if you stop smoking, you&#39;ll have physical withdrawals. You&#39;ll get sick; you&#39;ll get headaches, you&#39;ll get nausea, you&#39;ll get body chills, you&#39;ll get insomnia, you&#39;ll get irritable. Anyone who&#39;s a real stoner (as opposed to a social smoker) will know this. </p>

<p>I&#39;m actually a huge advocate of marijuana. But I&#39;m a bigger advocate of the truth.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like alcohol. Most people who drink alcohol will never end alcoholics. But that doesn&#39;t mean alcohol addiction isn&#39;t real. </p>

<p>That was more of a stretch than to endorse state approval of a misclassified medicinal plant. It is possible that he was helping his interests and donors in the pharma field, as he also had notably helped the insurance companies further dwindle the middle class with Obamacare and governmental fines forcing them into a system that is now so corrupt, that even basic healthcare is simply unaffordable for the middle class. </p>

<p>There is probably more to him not endorsing pot. I can see why he wouldn&#39;t make it legal or endorse, as EVERYONE would be smoking it because &quot;Mr. President said it was okay&quot;, queue little Timmy in 3rd grade lighting up. Plus Pot allows people to think about how bad the government/corporate married establishment has been screwing us and it&#39;s quite possible that the system might have to restructure in one way or another, which is bad because they have most people right where they want them, angry, in debt and working in a rut with no hope. Imagine if little Timmy realized the inherent repressiveness of the system at a young age. He probably wouldn&#39;t be busting his ass and worrying about never ending debt. He would probably just do something else to be happy and not live the &quot;American Dream&quot; which mostly leads to trying to obtain what you can&#39;t afford. This would obviously be bad for the government because a larger number of people may choose to live within their means and that&#39;s bad for the greed based economy...

<p>&quot;The president&#39;s [Obama] response, and that of his attorney general, is that it&#39;s a job for Congress. But that&#39;s not true, says Brookings Institution Senior Fellow John Hudak. According to a report authored by Hudak and Grace Wallack, the federal Controlled Substances Act clearly details a process by which the administration can take marijuana out of the drug schedules or, at the least, lower its schedule so that medical research can proceed.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It still comes across as hypocritical. You could have provided the source. </p>

<p>No matter what you&#39;re talking about it&#39;s a grandiose claim to say &quot;I think majority  of the people want it.&quot; So not asking the person who says &quot;Most everyone wants it&quot; for a source but asking me who said &quot;I think it could be as low as 60/40&quot; (a far more reasonable statement IMO) for a source seems hypocritical. </p>

<p>Either way 57% is just over a majority so OP claims of &quot;most everyone wants it&quot; is wrong. It&#39;s in reality &quot;a bit more than half want it.&quot; Now if it was 75% or higher I&#39;d agree with y&#39;all. </p>

<p>I agree it should be determined by the people but the fact of the matter is that it&#39;s a huge revenue stream so the states and fed are going to get involved in hopes of getting profit from it. Either be from legalization taxes or from the courts and prison system from enforcing it. In my state Ohio there was talks of legalizing it but the people found out it was a scheme to make the same rich people that started the legalization campaign even richer as they used the law to buy all the farms that would be allowed to grow that weed. </p>

<p>I&#39;m reallllllllly not a fan of the Trump administration apparently doubling down on the drug war. I think it&#39;s an unforgivable and backwards approach to take.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think referencing the lack of action by the Obama administration is a &#39;distraction&#39; - I think it shows that regardless of how different two administrations may seem, they both follow the same set of rules.</p>

<p>Doubling down on the drug war is only possible due to the Obama administration&#39;s inaction. </p>

<p>How do you figure?  The Trump admin could immediately reverse any changes the Obama admin made to drug scheduling.  Any lasting change would have had to go through a Congress which wasn&#39;t friendly to relaxing the war.  I agree that the Obama admin is remiss in not changing the scheduling, but that shouldn&#39;t overshadow the progress made on relaxing federal sentencing for nonviolent crime and the allowance of states to make their own laws regarding recreational use, something that almost certainly wouldn&#39;t have been allowed under a Republican administration and certainly wouldn&#39;t have happened if Trump were president when Obama was. </p>

<p>That&#39;s a misunderstanding. The states that made their own laws regarding recreational use are still in violation of federal law - the lack of enforcement by the Obama administration doesn&#39;t change the law.</p>

<p>My whole point is that there really isn&#39;t much of a difference between the two parties when it comes to drug policy. Democrats play slightly more &#39;good cop&#39; while Republicans play slightly more &#39;bad cop.&#39;</p>

<p>Obama could have reclassified it but didn&#39;t. He CHOSE not to. He also could have used the bully pulpit to push for the issue, but seeing as he didn&#39;t even attempt to reclassify it, Congress&#39; inaction isn&#39;t really much of a story.</p>

<p>I like that your entire comment is an attempt to frame my motivations and try your hand at some really weak armchair psychology.</p>

<p>So I&#39;ll just say again - the Obama administration <strong>CHOSE</strong> not to attempt to end the drug war. The only action they took was the standard action that goes back and forth between Democrats and Republicans when they&#39;re in charge of the executive.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh I have a big problem with Obama not rescheduling.  I just have an equally big problem with people who try distract from the difference that exists between mainstream Democrats and Republicans when it comes to this issue.  </p>

<p>As I said, I think the Obama administration&#39;s decision to relax sentencing for nonviolent offenders is significant, especially to those who would be rotting in prison now.  I think that and his deprioritization of enforcement allowed recreational use to become mainstream and come out of the shadows.  Could he have done a lot more?  Fuck yeah.  Should he?  Fuck yeah.  But that doesn&#39;t mean I have to ignore what he did which was more than any president before him or after. </p>

<p>Fully agree with you here - I think Session&#39;s words (and thus also Trump&#39;s words as it&#39;s his administration) are absolutely fucking absurd here.</p>

<p>As for the other drugs, I would definitely agree that they&#39;re a more serious problem that should be dealt with in a more serious way than marijuana (just as an example).</p>

<p>However, I&#39;m not convinced that incarceration of users or low-level dealers really provides the benefits that proponents claim. But a solution involving treatment seems to be beyond what we&#39;re currently capable of as a country. </p>

<p>The warmonger scum that pulled Bush&#39;s strings allowed it to happen, then blamed people who weren&#39;t responsible, and then used that as a pretext to take away pretty much all of the remainimg freedoms people in the US had.</p>

<p>As scum as Clinton is, this partisan bullshit is disgusting, and you have spit on the graves of American terror victims by pushing it. It was Bush jr. who allowed 911 to happen and it was his father who created and empowered the groups responsible, and Republicans need to acknowledge that they are the ones who caused and allowed the worst terror attack ever committed by non-state actors.</p>

<p>I honestly need to know where you get this from.</p>

<p>The USA has been dropping mercenaries and bombs in the Middle East since Clinton was in high school, but it was the CIA and their overwhelmingly Republican party puppets that variously armed, funded, provoked, maimed and slaughtered people in the Middle East.</p>

<p><strong>Why the fuck are people still talking about Hillary Clinton?</strong> She lost the fucking election, she&#39;s fucking irrelevant. How did Republican election propaganda infect so deeply that there are people that now believe Hillary Clinton is responsible for the Republican party&#39;s terrorism fuck-ups?</p>

<p><strong>We&#39;re still fucking talking about her because she was the secretary of state for 4 years, her husband was the fucking president of the United States, and she has, and still has her hands in plenty of bad business.</strong>. </p>

<p>Frankly, if you think Hillary is a harmless old lady just because the election is over you&#39;re delusional. Just because she lost doesn&#39;t mean she gets automatically pardoned from every bad thing she or her cabinet have done.  Powerful family with an incredibly fucked up sense of right and wrong. </p>

Calling someone out for who they voted for is petty and cheap, that person is not in your shoes and you are not in there&#39;s so who are you to say  he voted for Trump so he has no voice in this. 
You are the problem with the domocrat party, you just gave someone that extra little push to the right when you might have had a chance to pull the person to the left. </p>

<p>All this crap coming out of Democrats is hurting your party and Trump will be in office for 8 years I will put a guarantee on that.

<p>The difference is that OP is digging up someone&#39;s garden, and yet noone has tried to dig up his. He&#39;s the only one finding a connection there.</p>

<p>It comes down to how willing you are to do research on someone&#39;s record, which in my opinion is intrinsic to the content of this sub. Conspiracy is the willful act of digging so deep into something that sometimes you forget to come back.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>These Bernie type characters have been trotted out in so many elections over the last hundred years it is laughable. It can be hard to research the nobodies of elections through the years, when the mass media ignored them back then as well. Where would you look? News archives are full of nothing about the person ignored at the time.<br/>
Not too many people know who this stage actor was; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Smith">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Smith</a><br/>
He played an awesome fiction role, just like Bernie.<br/>
Neither matter at all. Just a little tiny false hope spark to keep you hoping. LOL<br/>
No matter how much your deep felt heartstring tugging , lump in the throat  desire of unbridled dreams of a John Lennon fantasy leader freeing us of the bonds of industry soars, it is not happening bro.<br/>
It&#39;s all a stage play. It&#39;s the easiest role to fill in any production, by a mile.<br/>
The Richard Dreyfuss, Judd Hirsch, Alan Alda type.<br/>
Bernie vs Military/Pharma Industrial Monsanto Walmart Hollywood Complex<br/>

    <div class="md"><p>Just a common sense observation. We know that Obama isn&#39;t strongly anti-marijuana in any way. He used to smoke himself back in his younger days. He has also publicly stated that marijuana should be treated like &#39;cigarettes or alcohol&#39; and pardoned more non-violent drug offenders than any other president but he said this on his way out of the door. So not too impressive from Obama but still a billion times better than Jeff Sessions that wants to ramp up the drug war even more and is actively reversing Obama&#39;s positions on non-violent drug offenders. He believes if you went down for smoking pot in the 70&#39;s and are still in prison it&#39;s a moral imperative that we keep you there.</p>

<p>As the first black president the scrutiny on him was immense. The narrative being spun by the right wing was that he was a radical leftist marxist secret member of the black panthers which given what we know now is absolutely hilarious but I digress. </p>

<p>If Obama came in and spent his political capital which was under so much aforementioned scrutiny on a massive campaign to legalize weed (which could have easily failed) then the attack ads write themselves. &quot;Black President only cares about weed! Of course he does! &quot;Whether you agree with his positions or not it&#39;s very obvious he chose to use his political capital elsewhere and his constant skirting away from the idea of totally legalizing weed is telling. </p>

<p>Do I agree with that? Not really but it does make a lot of sense. </p>

<p>I think this sub has been compromised by a lot of extreme right wing bullshit so I&#39;m expecting downvotes but that&#39;s how I see it since I&#39;ve been paying attention the entire time.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>He has also publicly stated that marijuana should be treated like &#39;cigarettes or alcohol&#39; and pardoned more non-violent drug offenders than any other president</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He also spent during his first term $100 million more than GWB did during his eight years cracking down on legal medical marijuana dispensaries, about $300 million. Additionally, half of the raids between 1996 and 2013 were during the four years of his first term. (His second term was about the same, but I&#39;m using these numbers because I conveniently have access to them.)  </p>

<p>The counter-argument here is that medical marijuana was more common during his term than in 1996 so of course there would be more. That&#39;s true, but we&#39;re still talking about spending hundreds of millions of dollars to actively do this, and considering it flies in the face of his campaign promises, I think the criticism still stands. </p>

<p>I wonder how much of that policy was there to prop up the private prison industry that Obama has spoken out against but also facilitated in scenarios like these. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Careful you don&#39;t straw man, you had a strong position before.  The argument isn&#39;t the binary &quot;does it factor into his thinking&quot;, it&#39;s how strongly does it factor.  Among aaaaaaaaaallll of the factors weighing on a president&#39;s mind, and all of the actors, influences, parties involved, interests, agendas, lobby groups and policies.  </p>

<p>There is reason to believe it factored early but not so much later.  Given the wide array of much stronger influences and factors, the thing stopping him from doing it wasn&#39;t &quot;oh shit well I&#39;m black, or I would&#39;ve definitely done it&quot; is not chief among them.  </p>

<p>If you want to argue that this is <strong>the</strong> reason that he didn&#39;t do it, don&#39;t bother responding, just downvote or something.  I don&#39;t think anyone in their right mind would believe that this is the literal cornerstone factor that trumps all other factors combined, though it&#39;s rational to believe that it&#39;s one small factor among many.</p>

Rescheduling would do nothing to affect that.  That kind of legalization would require Congress to change the law.  Rescheduling just allows the FDA to approve pharmaceuticals and the government to research.  All those businesses in legal states would still be violating federal law.  Obama&#39;s executive actions on enforcement discretion did far more than rescheduling even if it was moved down to schedule 5. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great. So Sessions made a statement that wound back his own previously legislated mandates against crack users because it was unfair. </p>

<p>Good for him. Big slap on the back. </p>

<p>What is your point, though? He did one conscionable thing? A position he had to reverse himself on? What a fucking hero. </p>

<p>But Obama boooo! </p>

<p>It&#39;s actually pathetic to argue this point. Look at actionable work on the ground and what Sessions has actually done. Do you know who Sheldon Adelson is and the 100&#39;s of millions he has invested in keeping MJ illegal and the money he has donated to Sessions and co?</p>

<p>Sessions made one conciliatory remark and he&#39;s great? Classic. </p>

<p>On the drug being a danger:</p>

<p>&quot;We need grown-ups in charge in Washington to say marijuana is not the kind of thing that ought to be legalized, it ought not to be minimized, that it&#39;s in fact a very real danger.&quot;</p>

<p>On Obama&#39;s more lax approach to pot enforcement and his admiration for &quot;Just Say No&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I think one of Obama&#39;s great failures, it&#39;s obvious to me, is his lax treatment in comments on marijuana... It reverses 20 years almost of hostility to drugs that began really when Nancy Reagan started &#39;Just Say No.&#39;&quot;</p>

<p>More on Obama and pot</p>

<p>&quot;You can&#39;t have the President of the United States of America talking about marijuana like it is no different than taking a drink… It is different… It is already causing a disturbance in the states that have made it legal.&quot;</p>

<p>On the kinds of folks who smoke weed</p>

<p>&quot;Good people don&#39;t smoke marijuana.&quot;</p>

As racist a backlash Obama received as it was, the backlash would have been heavier if he was helping &quot;criminals&quot; (read as &quot;black people&quot;) stay out of prison. At that point, trump probably would have won not just the electoral college, but also the popular election. Not to mention obama&#39;s own racist ass party was very much in favor of locking up minor drug offenders until just recently.

It would have been very hard to have undermined him on this issue. The GOP would have looked racist and backward. This is a linchpin issue for me. I can see that so many things are actually beyond the power of presidents including banking cartels, the war machine and the intelligence services. However is neglect of black men, in particular cannabis incarceration, shows he was just another for show president.</p>

<p>This is the problem the left has. They&#39;re always trying to find ways to make the right look &quot;racist and backwards&quot; when reality tells you that it was Bill Clinton that paved the way to put all the black people in prison to begin with. Then Obama did zero to change anything. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You totally missed the point. I&#39;m not making any partisan comment. Indeed my whole point is Obama was pretty much just another suit. I&#39;m saying the argument that he couldn&#39;t of run with legalisation because the GOP would have somehow demeaned him for it did not hold water. <strong>If</strong> they had chosen to make it a race issue they would have looked backward and racist. That&#39;s simply a fact. Drug decriminalisation is a win win for the democrats. It&#39;s a wedge issue that the republicans are on the wrong side of. Unfortunately there is no appetite in the democratic party to do anything radical so it&#39;s going no where.</p>

To be clear, I hate establishment Democrats just as much as I hate corporatist Republicans. But that doesn&#39;t mean I think all Democrats are Hillary clones. And there are differences between the two parties.
Democrats favor legalization
Democrats favor environmental protection
Democrats favor programs that protect our socal safe nets like Social Security, Medicare, and Obamacare
Democrats have a much better track record protected civil liberties (not a singe D voted for the anti-privacy bill)
A Democratic president had a bullet placed in osama&#39;s head
Let&#39;s work together to throw the establishment scum out from both sides of the aisle. Instead of trying to demoralize people with this false equivalency that both parties are the exact same.</p>

<p>Give me a break -- rescheduling marijuana was never a goal during Obama&#39;s two terms. And what do you think AG Sessions would do about it now? At least AG Eric Holder under Obama gave judges latitude in federal drug sentencing. Sessions&#39; former aides in the Senate are now lobbyists for one of the largest private prison corporations<a href="https://nonprofitquarterly.org/2017/02/27/follow-money-former-sessions-aides-lobbyists-private-prisons-group/">*</a>. Back in February, private prison stocks soared when Sessions issued a memo rescinding the DOJ&#39;s commitment to reducing the use of such prisons. Gee, I wonder how Sessions&#39; portfolio was looking after his announcement about sentencing guidelines this week?</p>

<p>The war on drugs is a war on Americans, and politicians are directly profiting from it.</p>

But namely in this sub, that can have a tendency to upvote things like this soon after the current administrations position is unsurprisingly made clearly public, they&#39;re not always upvoting it out of complete objectivity, instead because &quot;Obama!&quot;, so it is in this context, it is interpreted in a very partisan way to those who it is mainly reaching. We don&#39;t need another reason to try and rationalize AG Sessions&#39; actions when this administration could have easily came back and reverted a rescheduling anyways. And like BigSphinx said, aside from the INSANE opposition you know that Republicans would have put up for rescheduling, AG Eric Holder and the Obama administration were if nothing else, lax on &quot;enforcing&quot; federal law, and some federal judges were less harsh in their sentencing for low lever offenses. It wasn&#39;t perfect in any sense of the word, but &quot;incrementalism&quot;, as shitty as that is for so many issues and is much like Hillary would have gone for, we now instead have AG Sessions coming in wanting to destroy any progress we have made on this issue over the past 8+ years.</p>

<p>This post was meant to balance out the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6awhsy/im_fucking_tired_of_the_fucking_war_on_drugs_jeff/">Sessions propaganda</a> we saw yesterday. I say propaganda not because Sessions isn&#39;t a piece of shit (he probably is), but because BOTH parties are responsible for the mess we are in.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, because they&#39;re both beholden to their pharmesutical donors and don&#39;t actually give a fuck about their constituents. I get it. Sessions is definitely a piece of shit. I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve heard the &quot;I knew some good people in the KKK until I figured out that they smoked weed&quot; quote. At least under Obama, he realized that going hardball on this wasn&#39;t going to be popular, and he backed off in ways that weren&#39;t simply rescheduling, which on its own wouldn&#39;t have fixed all of the problems, it would again just be another incrementalist step. (Now cannabis would be on the same level as meth instead of heroin! Yay?)</p>

<p>Don&#39;t strawman me with fucking slavery man, that has nothing to do with this. How about the well over a thousand people who Obama excommunicated for low level offenses? He can only do so much when he was facing the party of &quot;NO&quot; for 8 years. Imagine how they would have spun total legalization if that&#39;s what Obama pushed for. Again, not defending him, because if he and the Democrats actually gave a fuck they could have worked through it when they had their supermajority, just like they could have gotten us single payer or a public option, but they didn&#39;t. I&#39;m not here making excuses for them. But you cannot deny that what they did was worlds ahead of the Trump administration making &quot;progress&quot; like a monkey with a sledgehammer smashing the delicate foundations that we had to continue moving forward on this issue.</p>

<p>And what about the thousands more who weren&#39;t so lucky to get picked?</p>

<p>And what about the Democratic Party rigging the primaries against Sanders, subverting our democracy and defrauding Bernie donors out of over $200 million. This post isn&#39;t simply about Obama, it&#39;s also to highlight the fact that both parties have fucked us over for years.</p>

<p>Here are some of their bipartisan efforts: &#39;94 crime bill, Iraq War (Clinton voted for it), keeping FPTP, unconstitutional spying, prison systems (via &#39;94 crime bill etc), telecommunications mergers, droning brown people (this has been going on for ~16 years now).</p>

<p>You guys can keep shitting on Trump, but he only became president because Democrats didn&#39;t let the most popular general election candidate on the ballot even after the public found out he was cheated throughout the primaries.</p>

<p>Classification is at the executive branch&#39;s discretion at the DEA.  The legislature can also alter it, but the POTUS doesn&#39;t need them to reschedule drugs. Obama should have appointed a DEA head who would reschedule or directed the head to do so. He is remiss there, but that shouldn&#39;t discount the immense progress he made in relaxing sentencing and respecting state&#39;s rights. </p>

<p>Sure Obama did not legalize it.  He had maybe a two year window were he could have.  He never claimed he would legalize it either.  He did however order the DEA to stand down and let states that legalized to do their own thing.  Which if you are right leaning you should of praised because of states rights and all.  Now he have the so called party of states rights wanting to crack down on.......states rights. </p>

<p>It is okay to criticize your party and call them out on this move.  No one is going to think less of you and in fact you would win over a bit of trust from the other side if you did.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah Obama would have squandered literally all of his political capital if he tried to reclassify marijuana. I&#39;m a huge proponent of drug legalization but I can understand why he would have focused his energies elsewhere given things like the worst recession in 70 years, multiple wars, etc. He didn&#39;t even have a Dem congress after 2010.   </p>

<p>Not to make it a race thing but having the first black president be super gung-ho on legalizing drugs would have driven the racists even crazier than they already were. </p>

Having worked in both IT and the restaurant industry, I can tell you that there is a huge number of smokers working within either.  Hell, when I worked in a callcenter I saw a guy roll a joint on his desk right out in the open. There was that little concern.  I remember this one hilarious occasion when another of my coworkers emailed the CEO to ask if the company would ever impose drug testing and he responded, &quot;sure, send me your drugs and I&#39;ll test them for you&quot;. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe the problem for Obama was several international drug control treaties that USA is signed up to, preventing legalisation. <a href="http://globalnews.ca/news/3157924/why-a-56-year-old-un-treaty-stands-between-you-and-legal-pot/">Canada is currently facing the same obstacles.</a></p>

<p>USA has an extra option which Obama​ used: allow states to decide for themselves on status of marijuana. The Federal government, which is signed up to these treaties would not be breaking them, while the individual states are not signed up to the treaties. It&#39;s a loophole.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you pay attention to what is said underneath it all the light may be there. Sessions and the new Drug Czar have indicated that they will enforce the laws as written and that if the states want it changed then congress and the house should change it. Sessions is a hardliner enforcing the laws that are in the books. Thing is the laws should not be there and that is the challenge I believe Sessions is sending to his bosses. I will enforce the laws as written........ If you want change then do your jobs and change it..........</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The marijuana issue will eventually be resolved when it is categorized as legal, akin to tobacco.</p>

<p>It will never be re-categorized as Shed-1 for the simple reason that it&#39;s medicinal properties cannot be dosaged accurately in natural plant form due to the vagaries of plant growth.  Even across multiple plants grown together in the same area, the properties shift slightly due to different aspects of watering/sunlight/soil nutrients where each plant pushed its roots, etc.</p>

<p>Schedule I substances are described as those that have the following findings:</p>

<p>1) The drug or other substance has a high potential for abuse.</p>

<p>2) The drug or other substance has no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States.</p>

<p>3) There is a lack of accepted safety for use of the drug or other substance under medical supervision.</p>

<p>Being unable to meet standardization of dosage means MJ in natural form cannot meet standards 2 and 3, which means no Schedule-1 classification for weed in the form you smoke.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The funny thing is, the executive actions the Obama took relaxing drug penalties did far more to advance legalization than rescheduling ever would.  Rescheduling would do nothing whatsoever to allow legitimate pot businesses within legalized states to remain open because they would still be illegal under the Controlled Substances Act.  What rescheduling would do is allow the FDA to approve pills and extracts for manufacture by pharmaceutical companies and it would also allow for government research.  It does nothing to change the law for dispensaries or the sale of whole flower.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, then what else did he do? There are still thousands of nonviolent criminals locked away and rotting their lives in prison. I&#39;m going to keep defending them over Obama because they can&#39;t defend themselves.</p>

<p>He also never addressed ending FPTP, and FPTP is exactly the reason why Republicans are allowed to exist. So if you really don&#39;t like what Republicans are doing then you can blame Democrats for 50% of it because they are half to blame.</p>

<p>If we had scored ballots then both Bernie &amp; Clinton could have been on the ballot as Democrats, and we wouldn&#39;t even need primaries so Bernie couldn&#39;t get cheated that way.

<p>I do get it. He didn&#39;t reschedule it and he didn&#39;t do anything for the thousands of prisoners still locked up. These are two different things that Obama did to continue fucking over the American people due to the same issue.</p>

<p>Rescheduling is something Obama actually could have done, and it would have helped. Not that we should be content with moving it down from schedule 1 to schedule 2, however.</p>

<p>look at that chart, it was vastly different when bush was in office.

<p>Because Obama didn&#39;t reschedule Marijuana, Trump has no option but to reverse Obama&#39;s policy of lower penalties for non-violent drug offenses? Interesting hypothesis. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t like either party, but the Dems were at least trending in the right direction on this issue. This is a huge step backwards, and knowing how draconian this administration is proving itself to be, there is likely more to come. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Would future generations have looked down on our government if we banned slavery before that idea became popular?</p>

<p>Likewise, would future generations have looked down on our government if we legalized marijuana before it was popular? (this is besides the fact that it was unpopular in part due to societal associations with crime, etc, which is a catch-22)</p>

<p>What if we never had prohibition? All that needless crime, conspiracy, and murder...</p>

<p>Or gay marriage?</p>

<p>The point is... maybe something is unpopular <em>because</em> it&#39;s illegal. Democrats had an opportunity to make a change on the issue and they chose not to.</p>

<p>&quot;The president&#39;s [Obama] response, and that of his attorney general, is that it&#39;s a job for Congress. But that&#39;s not true, says Brookings Institution Senior Fellow John Hudak. According to a report authored by Hudak and Grace Wallack, the federal Controlled Substances Act clearly details a process by which the administration can take marijuana out of the drug schedules or, at the least, lower its schedule so that medical research can proceed.&quot;</p>
