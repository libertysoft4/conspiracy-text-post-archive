        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Firstly, no. I don&#39;t believe all Jews are evil. However, I cannot help but notice their overpowering and immensely disproportionate representation in politics, media, banking etc, it&#39;s simply a statistical fact. The federal reserve, neoconservative politicians, virtually all major media outlets etc, their place is so powerful and usually in a negative way.</p>

<p>I try to fight my own prejudices. However, I&#39;ll see someone in an interview pushing for war, or defending the indefensible, and I&#39;ll think to myself &quot;I bet he&#39;s Jewish&quot;. So i go to check, and too many times it turns out to be true. Too many to be a coincidence.</p>

<p>Am I just a victim of propaganda? Am I an anti Semite? If so, how can I prove myself wrong and lay these feelings to rest? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A Jew is not necessarily a Semite. See my post about how &quot;they&quot; are changing language today - literally changing the definition of Semite to positively include people who speak Hebrew and more broadly - jews.  It&#39;s the epitome of doublespeak.  Find an old dictionary and look up the word Semite - don&#39;t let them control your thoughts - define words for you. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Everyone should have a dictionary from pre-1930. I actually originally caught on to this because of AA. See, our big book was written in 1932 using pretty sophisticated language, compared to what a fresh off the street alkie could be expected to understand at least. So, to understand exactly what the founders meant, we need a time period dictionary.</p>

<p>Why do we need a time period dictionary?
Because they change the fucking words. </p>

<p>This is the kind of research I encourage everyone to do. It&#39;s easy, it&#39;s obvious, and it is enlightening.</p>

But that experience you describe is so typical, a lot of people report that after they break free of the conditioning. Realize that antisemite is a propaganda term bar none, and the very fact that it&#39;s on the tip of everyones tongue is proof of an absurd level of privilege that the very people fighting &#39;white privilege&#39; enjoy without even being aware of the hypocrisy. But jews and being aware of hypocrisy don&#39;t mix in the first place. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Personally, I see the same issues with all 3 Abrahamic religions and can easily understand that it is something that turns the average person into a pawn, where they can be doing something bad but be sold on it as a good thing. The only people I have actual issues with are those at the top of the pyramid, the rest at the bottom are just useful idiots who aren&#39;t really doing anything malicious. </p>

<p>I guess the important part is to still treat individuals with respect, until proven otherwise. It is perfectly normal to have some form of internal judgement formed based on their characteristics (this is human nature, we analyze everything we see, our brains see patterns) but the difference is any criticism should be levvied at the ideology itself, rather than any people in particular.</p>

<p>Same thing with Islam, I find the ideology abhorrent, but I would never translate that over to individual people. Even if the ideology makes them do bad things, I consider that more reason to analyze said ideology deeper to understand how that is accomplished. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea Hitler was put in power to use as a straw-man against nationalism and any &#39;conspiracy theories&#39; about banks/freemasons. On the flip side, he also serves as a psyop on independent thinkers such as yourself to turn them into National Socialist bigots, who can be put down with ease and with the pleasure of the public.</p>

<p>What distinction is there between the media and the banks? The current MSM doesn&#39;t even make a net profit, they&#39;re completely reliant on drug and arms dealing profits from the CIA. Jeff Bezos, owner of Washington Post, got $650 Billion from the CIA.</p>

<p>There&#39;s plenty of media psyop specialists that aren&#39;t Jewish. Alex Jones is clearly not Jewish, neither is Michael Aquino. And yet they&#39;re pretty talented at subversion. Read the list of the people involved with MK-Ultra and it&#39;s not like all of them are Jewish. </p>

<p>I think you&#39;re just grasping at a simple explanation because reality is sad and harsh. It&#39;s easier to demonize one group than accept that there&#39;s a global coalition of people dedicated to ruling over a slave class.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi!
As we hope you can appreciate, the Holocaust can be a fraught subject to deal with. While don&#39;t want to curtail discussion, we also remain very conscious that threads of this nature can attract the very wrong kind of responses, and it is an unfortunate truth that on reddit, outright Holocaust denial can often rear its ugly head. As such, the <a href="/r/History">/r/History</a> mods have created this brief overview that addresses common questions, and included a short list of introductory reading. It is not intended to stifle further discussion, but simply lay out the basic, incontrovertible truths to get them out of the way.
What Was the Holocaust?
The Holocaust refers the genocidal deaths of 5-6 million European Jews carried out systematically by Nazi Germany as part of targeted policies of persecution and extermination during World War II. Some historians will also include the deaths of the Roma, Communists, Mentally Disabled, and other groups targeted by Nazi policies, which brings the total number of deaths to ~11 million. Debates about whether or not the Holocaust includes these deaths or not is a matter of definitions, but in no way a reflection on dispute that they occurred.
But This Guy Says Otherwise!
Unfortunately, there is a small, but at times vocal, minority of persons who fall into the category of Holocaust Denial, attempting to minimize the deaths by orders of magnitude, impugn well proven facts, or even claim that the Holocaust is entirely a fabrication and never happened. Although they often self-style themselves as &quot;Revisionists&quot;, they are not correctly described by the title. While revisionism is not inherently a dirty word, actual revision, to quote Michael Shermer, &quot;entails refinement of detailed knowledge about events, rarely complete denial of the events themselves, and certainly not denial of the cumulation of events known as the Holocaust.&quot;
It is absolutely true that were you to read a book written in 1950 or so, you would find information which any decent scholar today might reject, and that is the result of good revisionism. But these changes, which even can be quite large, such as the reassessment of deaths at Auschwitz from ~4 million to ~1 million, are done within the bounds of respected, academic study, and reflect decades of work that builds upon the work of previous scholars, and certainly does not willfully disregard documented evidence and recollections. There are still plenty of questions within Holocaust Studies that are debated by scholars, and there may still be more out there for us to discover, and revise, but when it comes to the basic facts, there is simply no valid argument against them.
So What Are the Basics?
Beginning with their rise to power in the 1930s, the Nazi Party, headed by Adolf Hitler, implemented a series of anti-Jewish policies within Germany, marginalizing Jews within society more and more, stripping them of their wealth, livelihoods, and their dignity. With the invasion of Poland in 1939, the number of Jews under Nazi control reached into the millions, and this number would again increase with the invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941. Shortly after the invasion of Poland, the Germans started to confine the Jewish population into squalid ghettos. After several plans on how to rid Europe of the Jews that all proved unfeasible, by the time of the invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941, ideological (Antisemitism) and pragmatic (Resources) considerations lead to mass-killings becoming the only viable option in the minds of the Nazi leadership. First only practiced in the USSR, it was influential groups such as the SS and the administration of the General Government that pushed to expand the killing operations to all of Europe and sometime at the end of 1941 met with Hitler’s approval.
The early killings were carried out foremost by the Einsatzgruppen, paramilitary groups organized under the aegis of the SS and tasked with carrying out the mass killings of Jews, Communists, and other &#39;undesirable elements&#39; in the wake of the German military&#39;s advance. In what is often termed the &#39;Holocaust by Bullet&#39;, the Einsatzgruppen, with the assistance of the Wehrmacht, the SD, the Security Police, as well as local collaborators, would kill roughly two million persons, over half of them Jews. Most killings were carried out with mass shootings, but other methods such as gas vans - intended to spare the killers the trauma of shooting so many persons day after day - were utilized too.
By early 1942, the &quot;Final Solution&quot; to the so-called &quot;Jewish Question&quot; was essentially finalized at the Wannsee Conference under the direction of Reinhard Heydrich, where the plan to eliminate the Jewish population of Europe using a series of extermination camps set up in occupied Poland was presented and met with approval.
Construction of extermination camps had already begun the previous fall, and mass extermination, mostly as part of &#39;Operation Reinhard&#39;, had began operation by spring of 1942. Roughly 2 million persons, nearly all Jewish men, women, and children, were immediately gassed upon arrival at Bełżec, Sobibór, and Treblinka over the next two years, when these &quot;Reinhard&quot; camps were closed and razed. More victims would meet their fate in additional extermination camps such as Chełmno, but most infamously at Auschwitz-Birkenau, where slightly over 1 million persons, mostly Jews, died. Under the plan set forth at Wannsee, exterminations were hardly limited to the Jews of Poland, but rather Jews from all over Europe were rounded up and sent east by rail like cattle to the slaughter. Although the victims of the Reinhard Camps were originally buried, they would later be exhumed and cremated, and cremation of the victims was normal procedure at later camps such as Auschwitz.
The Camps
There were two main types of camps run by Nazi Germany, which is sometimes a source of confusion. Concentration Camps were well known means of extrajudicial control implemented by the Nazis shortly after taking power, beginning with the construction of Dachau in 1933. Political opponents of all type, not just Jews, could find themselves imprisoned in these camps during the pre-war years, and while conditions were often brutal and squalid, and numerous deaths did occur from mistreatment, they were not usually a death sentence and the population fluctuated greatly. Although Concentration Camps were later made part of the &#39;Final Solution&#39;, their purpose was not as immediate extermination centers. Some were &#39;way stations&#39;, and others were work camps, where Germany intended to eke out every last bit of productivity from them through what was known as &quot;extermination through labor&quot;. Jews and other undesirable elements, if deemed healthy enough to work, could find themselves spared for a time and &quot;allowed&quot; to toil away like slaves until their usefulness was at an end.
Although some Concentration Camps, such as Mauthausen, did include small gas chambers, mass gassing was not the primary purpose of the camp. Many camps, becoming extremely overcrowded, nevertheless resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of inhabitants due to the outbreak of diseases such as typhus, or starvation, all of which the camp administrations did little to prevent. Bergen-Belsen, which was not a work camp but rather served as something of a way station for prisoners of the camp systems being moved about, is perhaps one of the most infamous of camps on this count, saw some 50,000 deaths caused by the conditions. Often located in the Reich, camps liberated by the Western forces were exclusively Concentration Camps, and many survivor testimonies come from these camps.
The Concentration Camps are contrasted with the Extermination Camps, which were purpose built for mass killing, with large gas chambers and later on, crematoria, but little or no facilities for inmates. Often they were disguised with false facades to lull the new arrivals into a false sense of security, even though rumors were of course rife for the fate that awaited the deportees. Almost all arrivals were killed upon arrival at these camps, and in many cases the number of survivors numbered in the single digits, such as at Bełżec, where only seven Jews, forced to assist in operation of the camp, were alive after the war.
Several camps, however, were &#39;Hybrids&#39; of both types, the most famous being Auschwitz, which was vast a complex of subcamps. The infamous &#39;selection&#39; of prisoners, conducted by SS doctors upon arrival, meant life or death, with those deemed unsuited for labor immediately gassed and the more healthy and robust given at least temporary reprieve. The death count at Auschwitz numbered around 1 million, but it is also the source of many survivor testimonies.
How Do We Know?
Running through the evidence piece by piece would take more space than we have here, but suffice to say, there is a lot of evidence, and not just the (mountains of) survivor testimony. We have testimonies and writings from many who participated, as well German documentation of the programs. This site catalogs some of the evidence we have for mass extermination as it relates to Auschwitz. I&#39;ll close this out with a short list of excellent works that should help to introduce you to various aspects of Holocaust study.

<p>The majority of American congress is Roman Catholics, there are over 160 Catholics in congress. Only ~5% of congress is Jewish. Both houses are presided over by Catholics: Paul Ryan in the House and Mike Pence, a self-described evangelical Catholic in the Senate.  The majority of supreme court justices are Catholic. The head of the Supreme Court is Catholic, John Roberts. I have documented over 50 Catholics involved in Trump&#39;s transition team and his advisory panels. </p>

<p>In America, the media narratives are controlled by the CIA which has always been dominated by Catholics. </p>

<p>Banking</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Federal reserve, the most important bank in America, is controlled by Catholics. The most powerful members of the fed boards of governors, Jerome Powell and Daniel Tarullo are both Jesuit-trained Catholics. Tarullo and Powell chair the majority of fed committees and the most important ones at that. That includes the committee of the affairs of the board of governors itself. They also control the lending of money to the federal government and supervise and grant approval to all banks in America in general. Even Janet Yellen&#39;s husband is a professor at Jesuit Georgetown University. And there are countless people working within the fed that are paid more highly than Yellen as well.</p>

<p>So I&#39;m afraid you have fallen into the propaganda of neo-nazies. That&#39;s okay though, for, now that you realize this you can join in fighting the foremost enemy, which is the Roman Papacy and Jesuits. </p>

<p>Fighting your own &quot;anti-semitism&quot; is nothing short of trying to force your head into the sand.</p>

<p>What if they were all mormons? Or moonies? Would their shared religious affiliation matter then? Or their texts, which may or may not call for subjugation of all other religions? Or atheists? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Firstly, no. I don&#39;t believe all white men are evil. However, I cannot help but notice their overpowering and immensely disproportionate representation in politics, media, banking etc, it&#39;s simply a statistical fact. The federal reserve, neoconservative politicians, virtually all major media outlets etc, their place is so powerful and usually in a negative way.
I try to fight my own prejudices. However, I&#39;ll see someone in an interview pushing for war, or defending the indefensible, and I&#39;ll think to myself &quot;I bet he&#39;s a white man&quot;. So i go to check, and too many times it turns out to be true. Too many to be a coincidence.
Am I just a victim of propaganda? Am I racist? If so, how can I prove myself wrong and lay these feelings to rest?&quot;</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>The numbers support this. What you fail to mention is <em>why.</em> </p>

<p>Before world war one, 80% of US Jews were employed in manual work, most of them in textile factories. </p>

<p>In the 1930s, about 20% of the Jewish men had free professions.</p>

<p>Antisemitism was further weakened after World War II and the restrictions on hiring Jews were reduced and later canceled as part of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. In 1957, 75% of US Jews were white-collar workers.</p>

<p>The rise of Jews to positions of power and wealth was a hard fought battle. They literally pulled themselves up by their bootstraps.</p>

<p>The over-representation of Jews compared to their percentage of the population in the industries you mentioned above is not intentional, it&#39;s a result of the successes of Jewish immigrants and their descendants. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>their place is so powerful and usually in a negative way. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Can you provide any information to back up this statement? To go back to my original reply, I could make this same point about people who are of any race, religion, or creed. Example: &quot;Christians are so powerful and usually in a negative way.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t mean to be blunt, but assuming that someone is Jewish because they do something you consider indefensible is kind of textbook anti-antisemitism. What you are describing here is a process of actively confirming your prejudice. It&#39;s also textbook confirmation bias. Do you ever consider that if look up the religion of people doing good things there will be Jewish people there as well? You say you find &#39;too many to be a coincidence&#39; but if you are trying to confirm your own belief about Jews from the onset then you are going to be prone to only noticing those results which affirm your perspective. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Am I just a victim of propaganda?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes. I am Jewish. I had a bar/bat mitvah. There are Jewish people who believe in everything and anything. There are Jewish people who smoke weed all day. There are Jewish people who love president trump. There are Jewish people who believe that the sate of Israel is committing war crimes against Palestinians. There are Jewish people who believe the earth is flat. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Am I an anti Semite? If so, how can I prove myself wrong and lay these feelings to rest?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You are only an Anti-Semite if you chose to actively be one. Everyone has implicit biases. You seem to recognize your own. This is an important moment, in fact. will you chose to broaden your mind, seek other perspectives, and realize that the world is to complicated for statements like Jews = bad? Or do you double down on your original beliefs. </p>

<p>Antisemitism is a tired, old ideology. It&#39;s been around for literally hundreds of years. Blaming Jews for things is literally a tradition. </p>
