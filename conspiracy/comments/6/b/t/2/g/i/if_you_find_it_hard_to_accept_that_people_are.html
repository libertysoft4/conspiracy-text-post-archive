Murder is very common.  To this list I will add Huey Long, Presidents Lincoln, McKinley and Garfield.  If we were to also list those who survived murder attempts we would add Presidents Teddy Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan.  Then others such as Yitzhak Rabin, George Wallace, and many more.  It has been said that Murder is as American as Apple Pie and there is enough truth in this that no one should suspend their ability to accept the commonality of it.  <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/List_of_United_States_presidential_assassination_attempts_and_plots">My comments have only scratched the surface.</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m almost the same age and fully agree. It&#39;s also worth mentioning that in and around most those infamous assassinations were any number of other highly suspicious and unusual deaths of certain key individuals who were close enough to those events shed far more light on them than what any of the official statements had to say about them but who never lived to tell the tale. There are any number of glaring discrepancies and more than just a whiff of a conspiracy and cover-up surrounding virtually all of them, not to mention subsequent developments that each of them could be seen as standing in the way of that proved to be highly profitable for certain people once they were out of the way. All, of course, simply attributed to nothing more than pure coincidence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And that is why I joined this sub. As Watergate proved, as the &#39;war on drugs&#39; proved, our government doesn&#39;t tell us crap and gets away with far more than it should. And yet instead of forcing the government to spill its secrets and removing anyone who commits such scandals from office, we keep electing the same corrupt liars.</p>

<p>But instead of proving a pure truth, people are instead politicizing the sub to prove their personal truth. They discredit one side of the government to make the other look better, instead of showing exactly how wrong both parties are.</p>

<p>I feel this competitiveness stems from the two-party system. Instead of giving us multiple choices, it instead polarized politics, to the point that many people see it less as the drive for a better country and more the drive to see your side win a competition.</p>

<p>I would describe my own life as one continuous search for the truth and for improvement in the quality of life.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am with you in the spirit of the search, and <em>(sigh)</em>, I am not far behind you in terms of years of searching - and the quest goes on...</p>

<p>To me, the most frustrating part has not been the lack of discoveries, rather, it is that the VALUE of such discoveries is indiscernible to those who lack the understanding of the historical and political contexts in which such gems are set.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like trying to explain the significance of a microchip to a bunch of illiterate medieval peasants. They may be sincere in their interests, but having no grasp of relevant context, most just aren&#39;t going to &quot;get it&quot;.</p>

<p>That&#39;s okay, I suppose. The fascination is in the search itself, and the &quot;reward&quot; comes when, on rare occasion, we enlighten others as well.</p>

<p>Carry on, my good man!</p>

<p>One consequence is over inflating information.  Another consequence is the exaggerated expectation of infallibility when speaking in regards to any event or subject.  Online or in person you are expected to be an expert in your field if you have any a semblance of knowledge regarding the topic.  Because it&#39;s impossible for everyone to be an expert in everything, but wholly acceptable for someone to be completely ignorant on a subject, this encourages people to reject learning.</p>

<p>This avoidance of self education as a defensive mechanism not only fuels ignorance but also breeds misinformation.  Misinformation comes from echo chambers filled with individuals uninterested in meaningful research and only concerned with absorbing information quickly from a trusted source that is assumed to have processed the information.  The processing of this information distills the data and research into a true or false answer to the question - &quot;Should I like this?&quot;</p>

<p>Learning for the average person is difficult.  I say this because if it were easy the worlds populations would be much more educated than they are.  Cultures can surely sway that difficulty but it&#39;s a universal constant for life to find the easiest path to follow.  I suppose this pathing, which is always compared to a river&#39;s flow, could go a step further.  Our current environment with education and information has become so immense humanity is still struggling to keep up.  Instead of the rivers of human understanding living in a flood plain they exist in a canyon.</p>

<p>Not entirely sure, but almost 0 chance he died in Germany. He was a Rothschild plant, and Argentina is a very likely place. There were reports that he was there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think one of the biggest unaddressed conspiracies of reddit.com is that the reddit administration continues to push the idea of a majority userbase in their 20&#39;s. I remember a survey done back in 2010 or 2011 and they couldn&#39;t wait to publish the results and show everyone how &quot;cool and hip&quot; the userbase was. They published all sorts of data, including professions, etc...</p>

<p>It is my humble opinion that reddits current userbase (for at least the last 2 years) is predominantly high school kids and the second largest demographic is middle school kids. </p>

<p>See <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/309fuf/how_reddit_was_destroyed_ver30/">&quot;How Reddit was Destroyed&quot;</a> to witness a very deliberate and systematic approach to turning this website into the bought and paid for garbage propaganda machine that we currently have. </p>

<p>This process created an online environment that aggressively pushed away the very demographics that allowed reddit to become the 4th biggest website on the planet. So what we have, just like Facebook, just like Youtube, and every other popular social website is history is an exodus of the founding group (ages 17-35) and the entrance of the next group (ages 9-25) and once this second group with an average age of 15 or 16 decides to leave, then we will see (again like every other social media platform) the entrance of the 35-70yr crowd.</p>

<p>Right now, reddit has an average age of 15 or 16 years old and the greater majority of them are from the US and Canada (probably over 75%).</p>

<p>These are people who were literally in diapers or not even born during 9/11 and who are currently knee-deep in the (completely outdated) indoctrination system known as North American high school. </p>

<p>They use social signaling as a way to identify themselves as part of the &quot;cool group&quot; and this is never anything but jumping into the latest circlejerk pool while screaming &quot;cannonball&quot; so that as many people as possible see the splash they make. </p>

<p>Its all about being &quot;in&quot; and &quot;in-the-know&quot; by blindly repeating the latest meme news which has been manufactured by the globalist who control the mainstream media (and reddit and facebook are both now pillars of mainstream media), and then this human weakness is further manipulated by the appearance of a fake and manufactured &quot;peer consensus&quot; which is the product of NYC Craigslist ads and Washington DC &quot;think tanks&quot; combining to put tens of thousands of people into what used to be called a &quot;call center&quot; but is now refitted to be a online propaganda machine where the employees get minimum wage, type from scripts, have managers in the know coordinating attacks, and directors above the managers getting the daily orders. </p>

<p>Believe me I know, I used to work in one of these centers. Nobody even questions what they are doing because we get a paycheck and the promise of overtime (time and a half) hours. I once brought it up at lunch and my little group of work friends showed a cognitive dissonance so thick that I literally got frightened by the reactions and dropped the subject.</p>

<p>So it is not just &quot;high school kids&quot; allowing the information age to turn into lies, it is also the college age kids and above who turn a blind eye and who will do anything for a paycheck because of the times we are currently living in, a world where Wall Street greed and corrupt Western-led politics caused a global meltdown of the world&#39;s economy. </p>

<p>Which is another thing, none of this majority reddit userbase even has a fucking clue how different it was being a kid in the 70&#39;s, 80&#39;s, early 90&#39;s, etc... or how much different the US (and by default world) was before 9/11.</p>

<p>They cannot even conceive of those times because they have no memories or experiences to compare. So while these people have no concept or clue how much shit we have all been smeared with, they are simultaneously being brainwashed by school, the internet, real peers, mainstream media, fake peer consensus, TV shows, movies, today&#39;s horribly wrong sponsored-prostitution of the word &quot;science&quot; and a million other things.</p>

<p>All the while those very institutions whitewash pre-9/11 history right in front of our eyes. Something that no pre-internet generations could have ever seen so blatantly. But it doesn&#39;t matter, because we are now outnumbered on this website and the manufactured echo-chamber simply gets louder day by day. Becoming more and more effective by the minute. Daily online Two-Minutes Hates sessions brought to you by a masterful take-over of the digital world.</p>

<p>And anyone who says anything other than the daily circlejerk gets their opinion shoved behind a collapsed icon or behind a [deleted] sign that you don&#39;t even see if you are signed in. And since I have had hundreds of comments shadow deleted like this in the last 2 years, I can only imagine how many people&#39;s opinions out there are being deleted daily on this website and they don&#39;t even know it because they never even considered checking.</p>

<p>And the scary thing is that it is comments like this being deleted. Don&#39;t get it twisted and think I am talking about &quot;da Jews&quot; or being rude or insulting. It is literally comments like this one, and so I will check every hour or so to make sure that I can still see when I am signed out. </p>

<p>Heed my warnings. I, like most of the old-school crowd on this subreddit and website, have been pushed to my limit and rarely even post anymore. So its a damn effective system they have running here. You have been warned. Nothing good can come of this. If you want one piece of advice from me: travel. Leave wherever you are from and see the world, see how much you have been lied to, see how much you have manipulated since birth by party politics, nationalism, and an intentional highjacking of your baser instincts. </p>

<p>Once you leave the bubble, things suddenly start making a lot more sense. So do it. </p>

<p>Peace and love.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First up,Wikipedia isn&#39;t the only place to find information on the vast Internet. You&#39;re either old or stupid if you believe that. So now, lemme see if I can get this right. You, random redditor, makes a ton of bold, wild and improbable accusations and you present them as facts. You utilize statistics etc, but yet when asked for verification you can&#39;t show a single thing to prove that you <em>aren&#39;t</em> talking out of your ass? Not a single thing? C&#39;mon. </p>

<p>How about this. &quot;The world actually only has 4 billion people and the higher numbers are made up by globalist shills to ensure they keep control of the resources in their countries and keep them flowing&quot;. You read that and it sounds magnificent and dandy right? But you want to independently verify this yourself and you ask me for a source or sources. Then instead of backing up my claims I just handwave that away and complain about ignorant sheeple. See how that works? Provide sources so others can independently draw the same conclusion. People who refuse to do that then rant when their bs isn&#39;t well-received or believed are the nuts that give conspiracy theorists a bad rep</p>

<p>Even reddit admins cant prove the age of the people on this site. They can only send surveys and hope the small amount who answer are not liars. And if reddit admins didnr like the results, I doubt they would publish them honestly. They have no agency monitoring them and they can say anything they want.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Main reason why your first comment catched my eye is the fact that there are old people that don&#39;t really understand things either, and internet is famously full of idiots. As such, I just personally don&#39;t ever think about the age of the commenter as when it comes to online conversations, it generally doesn&#39;t matter. Some 13 year old can act wiser than some 33 year old etc. Maybe the particular 13 year old kid just happens to be interested in history and knows how to research stuff.</p>

<p>You do have a point though; younger people tend to not know enough (or particularly tend to not have enough personal experience) when it comes to things like global politics/economics - in certain topics the commenter&#39;s age and experiences will affect a lot of things. It&#39;s just that you literally can&#39;t know the other guys age without creeping through the persons comment history and whatnot.</p>

<p>I usually take comments at face value: if the comment sounds stupid, I don&#39;t care if it sounds stupid because of his age or if he just happens to be stupid. And on the other hand if it sounds wise, I still don&#39;t care if the commenter is 10 or 50 (unless it&#39;s relevant in the context, of course).</p>

<p>I personally think that you should always try to explain things and if you as an older adult refuse to talk to younger people then you have no right to judge them for not understanding things and you also have no right to blame them for being brainwashed by media etc.</p>

<p>If someone shows interest in something I&#39;ll try and explain it to them regardless of how old they are. If they want to argue or debate with me I&#39;ll do that as well. </p>

<p>I had to grow older, much older unfortunately, before I understood the difference between being smart and being wise. People that stay curious about the world and continue to seek knowledge of all forms every day spend most of their time learning how much they don&#39;t know. </p>

<p>And now that I&#39;m more than halfway through my journey in this life I start to get hints of the wisdom that people older than myself have access to. If you can imagine how you would treat a child and have a pretty solid understanding of its needs and motivations, that never stops happening and it is weird to see younger adults as children. When someone feels that moment of weirdness they&#39;ll usually say something like &quot;When did I get so old?&quot;. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was just reading a review of a book at Goodreads and I couldn&#39;t believe how dumbed down the site has become. Review after review is littered with stupid gifs, memes and just &quot;Luuurrrvvvv Edmond Dantes, he&#39;s soooo keewwllll, hihi, thousand heart emojis&quot;. That&#39;s when I realized that most of the reviews were written by teenagers and that I could just forget the site.</p>

<p>I agree so much with your comment, sadly, the quality of a site declines when it gets overtaken by dumb teenagers. It&#39;s not fair to call all of them dumb, there are surely many that could write well thought-out comments or just produce quality content without using thousand emojis and memes.</p>

<p>I&#39;m almost thirty and I got to know teenagers that are serious, hard working, well educated and who have a clear grasp on the world. Sadly, this doesn&#39;t seem to apply to many that comment here on reddit.</p>

<p>I wonder if there has ever been such a rapid decline of living quality within a few generations. Who knows, maybe this is why today&#39;s teenagers are so incredibly dumbed down. At least they know how to contour and put their photos on instagram.</p>

<p>It is also painful for me as a parent to see how little opportunity there is for the younger generation and how much society has actively cultivated hate and disrespect for them.  That is the part I absolutely do not understand.   What kind of society denigrates and hates its own young?  </p>

<p>Of course there are going to be a few bad apples, but by and large they are no worse than any other generation and have less opportunity to improve their lot.  I am fortunate the my kids are managing well and most are in (or were in) a state that still has some opportunity for the younger generation.  But if they had been born a decade later, then I think it would have been even harder for them.  It is just getting worse and worse.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, this is awful as well. What&#39;s even more painful is if parents act as if the youth is just entitled and lazy, when they ignore that everything was handed to them on a silver platter and that times have changed. The society not only shuns the youth, but older job searchers are also humiliated. No one will take them because they cost too much or because they&#39;re too experienced.</p>

<p>It was long portrayed as &quot;progress&quot; when all the manufacturing jobs were outsourced to the East. Now we&#39;re left with shitty service jobs like retail or waiting tables or completely superfluous jobs like &quot;food stylist&quot; or &quot;personal shopper&quot;. There are few meaninful and satisfying jobs (like doctors, police men, nurses, teachers) left and they&#39;re mostly financed by the state, which is sadly shrinking. We&#39;re all caught in a vicious cycle and we&#39;re all going down the drain collectively.</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s problematic to call a whole generation &quot;bad&quot; or &quot;good&quot;, but we can&#39;t deny that a baby boomer will have a different experience of life than millenials who live among the scraps of what has been once a successful civilization.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think much of the hate is largely toward the group that are so often in the press, especially in the universities. Where it&#39;s just a liberal minded circle jerk and thought contradictory to it is just shut down asap.</p>

<p>And I would disagree on having opportunities to improve &quot;their lot&quot;. I&#39;m 27 and have so many more resources for improving myself and my economic status now than when I initially came out of high school. It takes research and a willingness to relocate for job or school opportunities. If you contain yourself to a local sphere then yes, you&#39;re going to be limited. I left home at 19 with $200 and a duffle of clothes to start my life over and now make on average 55k a year. Opportunity is everywhere.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are the age of my sons.  Yes, for that age group, I think there was some opportunity, at least in some states.  In many states, such as NY  and particularly on Long Island, the chances are slim and the pay is really terrible relative to the cost of living.  For people that already have made it, it is fine, but for someone starting out it is really poor.  OK, on the other hand, has much more opportunity for the young.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But it shouldn&#39;t be that way. That you have to throw your whole life away and bend over backwards just to get by in a decent way. Not everyone wants to leave their home and family behind. I moved away, but it shouldn&#39;t be forced upon those who don&#39;t want to.</p>

<p>These people shouldn&#39;t be called lazy. It&#39;s a sign that something is seriously wrong in our society. We have a surplus of food, energy and everything that is important for human life. Yet we are brainwashed that we are &quot;lazy&quot; if we don&#39;t contort ourselves completely. It&#39;s the system that&#39;s broken. This brainwashing is just to divide the population, to make us hate each other so that we don&#39;t see who the real perpetrators are. The politicians and CEOs who make the system are those that we should hate, not the others who struggles just as much.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree, the system is completely broken. That, however, doesn&#39;t mean that opportunity is going to be the same geographically. To think that opportunity should be or ever will be the same for everyone no matter where you live is just delusional. The job market and solid post-secondary education is always going to be completely different for say Dothan, AL and San Francisco, CA. You can&#39;t honestly make the comparison in either regard.

    <div class="md"><p>This same thing is happening to youtube. The community that brought the platform into the modern consciousness is being pushed away by the suits in favor of a new way to sell toys to kids. These toy companies were losing money due to the rapid development of streaming services, notably youtube that was free to use, so they just started dumping money onto anyone who sold the idea of toys on their channel, and made sure youtube would give them greater control over advertisement so as to prune the &quot;undesirable&quot; channels that provide controversial content that might hurt their image. It has gotten so out of hand, that some people rebrand their channels almost overnight from being vlogging/gaming/art/sketches to toy unboxing and reviews, all without any concern towards their former fans. Imagine you were watching your favorite show and then one day, all of a sudden, the show becomes some twisted form of itself with product placement all over, and crude jokes for children thrown around. </p>

<p>And anyone who says anything other than the daily circlejerk gets their opinion shoved behind a collapsed icon or behind a [deleted] sign that you don&#39;t even see if you are signed in.

</blockquote>

<p>Seriously, this happens at a stupid rate. I am part of some subs where to say anything against the popular opinion is complete blasphemy, even stupid things. Here&#39;s an example: I&#39;m part of a sub that talks about eating limited calories per day. Within this sub, there are people who go crazy about this particular brand of fake ice cream that has a few less calories so they justify eating a whole pint of it. I point out how ridiculous that is (when you can just have a normal portion of regular ice cream and not gorge) and I get downvoted and/or deleted to oblivion. And that&#39;s just on a silly meaningless type of thread.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your comments resonates very strongly with me. The number of these kinds of comments have been reduced to about 1/month here which I manage to bump into. Being from a European country (not so different from the US brainwash but still) and having traveled a bit in my short life so far I can say your words hold a lot of weight. </p>

<p>There is something very scary happening with the people of the USA and I have not been able to put it into words. I was born in the 90&#39;s and have felt something strange missing in all of this. The world we have right now. The community is somehow missing, the sense of belonging. Historically it has been dangerous when young people don&#39;t have a place in the world. It makes me vary of the future. I just hope we make the right choices and go the right way. </p>

<p>I just wanted to one thing you&#39;ve not mentioned; that is the new entrepreneurship streaming allowed. Teens trying to explain the world and things to teens.</p>

<p>If they&#39;re not on about the consumation of certain goods they&#39;ll give their opinions on &#39;ongoing things in the world&#39; with a follow ship that state TV could - at times - only dream of.</p>

<p>Naturally the setup of these shows is all but thorough. Additionally it&#39;s admittedly also hard to not fall for some nutjobs&#39; conspiracy stuff that solely pursuits his own agenda.</p>

<p>Anyway, the one I&#39;ve learned - live your life in a fashion that you don&#39;t have to deal with regret when finally lying on your deathbed. The world has been spinning before us and it will do so after us. While the &#39;grander scheme of things&#39; is in fact worrying, the small scheme of things is not. The latter also is within our power(s) to change for the better ;)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well personally, what I <em>really</em> think (as opposed to what I can prove) is that the 60s-era assassinations were exceedingly clumsy and obvious, and in the modern world an assassination is much more likely to be concealed as an accidental death, e.g. a plane crash.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not so young, and up until about 10 years ago, I was completely blind to the other side of history.  I watched a bunch of &quot;boring &quot; documentaries, read a few books, and I slowly began seeing the world differently.</p>

<p>I&#39;m to the point now where I can&#39;t even turn the TV on anymore.</p>

<p>I see what they&#39;re censoring.  They want you to believe political assassinations, false flags, distraction memes, etc. don&#39;t exist, and therefore aren&#39;t relevant to the current (bullshit) narrative.  </p>

<p>I wish more people were seeing the things the same way.</p>

Just an employee of the country&#39;s real masters

Why did Reagan and Obama both go after Qaddafi
We invaded sovereign soil, going after oil
Taking countries is a hobby paid for by the oil lobby</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Accidentally? According to the people who were there (and taking fire along with Tillman), there was absolutely no way the shooters didn&#39;t know they were firing in friendlies. Not to mention the ever changing story to back the entire incident. First it was enemy combatants, then it was friendlies with ARs and finally, it came out that he was likely hit in the head and face 3 times from incredibly close range.</p>

<p>In reality only 3-4% of depression sufferers end up taking their own lives. Someone like Aaron Swartz, who left no note and was found hanged (the professional assassin&#39;s favourite method of staging a suicide) may well have been depressed, but he also presented a threat to some very powerful people, if the stories about his intent to blow the whistle on a huge paedophile ring are correct.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All the royalty was forced to live a life of exile in the majestic pristine mountains of Switzerland, after the fall of the Monarchical charades. At the time, every national Monarchy shared one common feature. Every one of their personal guards were Swiss, throughout all of Europe.</p>

<p>This is well recorded in the French Revolution, among others, where the Swiss Guard were the staunches defenders of the Royalty, legendary, really, even in battle prior to that, as the &#39;last line of defense&#39;, most well equipped, and most trained line of defense. Thus the Swiss choose to guard the Pope as well.</p>

<p>Among the unique features of Switzerland, such as $97,000 median incomes ( vs $29,000 US), no political assassination, mandatory nuclear fallout shelters, nationalized agriculture, strict environmental laws, liberal human rights, cooped industrial education, union employment, and only nation worldwide under direct democratic rule with a council of 7 Presidents; Switzerland was also the first nation to relocate their Jewish populations and burn them alive in order to take over the Banking Industry, in 1349.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Study House Savoy.</p>

<p>Likewise, keep in mind unlike the &#39;national&#39; borders of today, the rivers played a major part in trade and communication. Thus, lower France and the Rhine land are often influenced by the Swiss and can be seen as an economic unit.</p>

<p>Likewise, it&#39;s important to keep in mind they were the first nation to electronically connect every home via telephone wire, in 1898, well before many other nations, and are the international postal headquarters as well. I forget the name of the Swiss press, but that had a form of nationalized press for a long, long time.</p>

<p>When the US began it&#39;s CIA service, it was modeled, or upgraded, after Swiss style espionage, primarily lead by Allen Dulles who had spent some 20 years in Switzerland previously. After the Cuban Missile Crisis, he was fired by JFK prior to serving as a judge who shared the belief there was no grand conspiracy to assassinate him. The primary form of Swiss CIA was &#39;technological guerrilla warfare&#39;, where as prior-US CIA activities were &#39;service to nation&#39;.</p>

<p>Rolex and the Red Cross are both Swiss Charities worth considering.</p>

<p>I almost forgot to mention, forms of what we&#39;d call &#39;satanism&#39; (Human Sacrifice rituals, slave master relationships, and occult imagery) are quite popular with Swiss elite, and was the chosen national celebration for the grand opening of the world&#39;s largest tunnel.</p>

<p>Lastly, however, their political system is a wonder to behold. Their constitution ratified around 1850, was guided on the principal of &#39;social direct democracy&#39;, with strong limits over executive power. For example, their council of 7 executives are not even permitted to join the EU, join TPP, or enter into any &#39;superstate&#39; alliance without a national vote. Their form of Democracy is truly a wonderful system, and absolutely unique in the world.</p>

They seem to have education figured out. The US could have modeled their system, but chose to make up some new pile of crap, with committees of unqualified goons, sending us down the education toilet.<br/>
The US could have modeled any decent national system, or modeled any decent upper class private system, but went for experimental whims, based around committees of morons, and lots of microsoft profit.<br/>
Watch as American kids learn to have more feelings, and world citizenship programming, when we could have easily modeled a successful system.<br/>
It will only cost a trillion to belly flop into a cesspool of faeces.</p>

<p>I think Switzerland&#39;s status has been a result of lots of history. Maybe it is the kind of place you&#39;re talking about now, but I think that&#39;s due to how neutral they are as well. If anyone starts wars, Switzerland would be the place to be to watch it unfold. It&#39;s not because Switzerland caters to them as much as it&#39;s just the obvious safe place to be I think.</p>

<p>It&#39;s pretty interesting. It might literally be the result of 700 years of history.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>MLK&#39;s politics were more <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther_King_Jr.#Politics">complex</a> than that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Although King never publicly supported a political party or candidate for president, in a letter to a civil rights supporter in October 1956 he said that he was undecided as to whether he would vote for Adlai Stevenson or Dwight Eisenhower, but that &quot;In the past I always voted the Democratic ticket.&quot;[260] In his autobiography, King says that in 1960 he privately voted for Democratic candidate John F. Kennedy: &quot;I felt that Kennedy would make the best president. I never came out with an endorsement. My father did, but I never made one.&quot; King adds that he likely would have made an exception to his non-endorsement policy for a second Kennedy term, saying &quot;Had President Kennedy lived, I would probably have endorsed him in 1964.&quot;[261] In 1964, King urged his supporters &quot;and all people of goodwill&quot; to vote against Republican Senator Barry Goldwater for president, saying that his election &quot;would be a tragedy, and certainly suicidal almost, for the nation and the world.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Goldwater nomination, along with Republican reaction to the Civil Rights Act of 1964, was also pushed conservative Jackie Robinson into the arms of the Democratic party. Robinson considered Republican support for Goldwater and lack of support for the Act to be a betrayal, an insult, and ominous for the future.</p>

I do agree there is racism but is burning down your neighborhoods and looting innocent store owners going to help. No. But that was just that groups set of extremists no different than westborugh Baptist church or Islamic extremist. Its the good and the bad.
Personally ive always felt that BLM needs a  leader and a set goal. To be able to reasonably achieve goals without resorting to means like they used in Ferguson or Baltimore.</p>

<p>I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro&#39;s great stumbling block in the stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen&#39;s Council-er or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate who is more devoted to &quot;order&quot; than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly says &quot;I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I can&#39;t agree with your methods of direct action;&quot; who paternalistically feels he can set the timetable for another man&#39;s freedom; who lives by the myth of time and who constantly advises the Negro to wait until a &quot;more convenient season.&quot;</p>

The whole point of pushing this conspiracy is a) promoting that the DNC info was leaked not hacked b) discrediting the allegations of interference against Russia and c) painting Hillary and the DNC as monsters.

<p>Thats not the point I was making however. Regardless of how you feel about Trump- you can&#39;t deny that he would have something to gain if there were any credible leads pertaining to this story. His lack of interest in it implies that there are none.</p>

Seth Rich was probably murdered his involvement in the DNC just like the other 3 conveniently dead DNC peeps that more cant testify or take part in the cases involving the DNC. The DNC rigged primaries against Bernie in many if the same ways republicans fucked with Ron Paul....

<p>What about Assange specifically stating a 27 year old DNC employee may be the leaker? And then Wikileaks offering a reward for information on his murder? Coincidence? I&#39;m serious - how do you reconcile this..?</p>

<p>To see people in this sub downvote you and comment against you with such <em>certainty</em> that you are wrong is awkwardly out of place for this sub.

    <div class="md"><p>I just think it&#39;s awfully convenient for Wikileaks. My point of view is that Seth is the perfect scapegoat to paint the DNC/Clinton as even more evil. Which sure they might be bad, but I can&#39;t call them murderers without proper conviction.</p>

<p>Wikileaks obviously hates Clinton, Assange obviously likes Russia(having a show on RT), so why wouldn&#39;t they take the opportunity to paint the Seth Rich murder as a DNC/Clinton murder. </p>

<p>And I know everyone says Wikileaks has to protect its sources. But if it&#39;s that big of a deal, and obviously Wikileaks would have evidence that Seth was the leaker, then why not give it up? </p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s impossible Clinton called a hit on Seth, but I think it&#39;s 100% fair to flip the situation and look at it like Wikileaks is lying to further it&#39;s own agenda. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/08/10/wikileaks-offers-20000-reward-over-murder-of-democrat-staffer-se/">Literally no evidence?</a></p>

<p>Seems strange that Wikileaks would put a $20k bounty on information leading to the killer, and Assange <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2017-05-16/murdered-dnc-staffer-seth-rich-shared-44000-emails-wikileaks">would reference the killing personally.</a>  </p>

<p>There are two links right there, make of them what you will.</p>

<p>Also the persistent stance that it was a &quot;robbery&quot; (even though nothing was stolen) is annoying at best, suspicious at worst.  So all the gang violence in Chicago every weekend is just &quot;robberies gone wrong.&quot;  JFK was just a &quot;robbery gone wrong.&quot;</p>

<p>All of these articles about his boyhood in Indonesia and his life in Hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse, multicultural and putting it in a new light [...]his roots to basic American values and culture are at best limited.

<p>It has nothing to do with Obama&#39;s birth. It&#39;s a campaign strategy that targets Obama&#39;s upbringing. While this strategy is somewhat despicable it doesn&#39;t use false claims about Obama&#39;s birth. I&#39;m quoting all of this from the link you provided. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wait no. That&#39;s not the logic. </p>

<p>Basically for this to work, deleted posts would need to include a large number of posts deleted for a correct reason. He&#39;s arguing that the people  who weren&#39;t murdered are the correctly deleted posts and that very, very few deleted posts are do so due to a conspiracy.</p>

<p>You can&#39;t use posts not deleted because this implies all posts are equivalent to the population of people who apparently piss off politicians. When in actuality you need to sort you posts somehow where the metaphor for the dead and the living &quot;thorn in side&quot; people are separate from the larger population for a comparison. Otherwise you&#39;re comparing the amount of people alive on the planet to the number of people who are considered &quot;thorn in side&quot; by using what you imply are posts deleted by reddit in a conspiratorial manner. </p>

<p>Dude was drunk and walking through a dodgy neighbourhood. He somehow took 2 hours to get from bar1 (after leaving drunk) to bar2, despite being a short walk. He was was torn, but not removed. I&#39;d say it was a mugging gone wrong, a struggle, a gunshot and then the mugger ran off before searching the bloody victim for money (if I just shot someone I wouldn&#39;t stick around to go through their back pocket)</p>

<p>Wikileaks obviously hates Clinton, Assange obviously likes Russia(having a show on RT), so why wouldn&#39;t they take the opportunity to paint the Seth Rich murder as a DNC/Clinton murder. </p>

<p>And I know everyone says Wikileaks has to protect its sources. But if it&#39;s that big of a deal, and obviously Wikileaks would have evidence that Seth was the leaker, then why not give it up? </p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s impossible Clinton called a hit on Seth, but I think it&#39;s 100% fair to flip the situation and look at it like Wikileaks is lying to further it&#39;s own agenda. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok. Given that they are fucking us over big time, and have been doing so for a long long time, we now know and understand this fact to a certain extent. The extent to which we understand these facts vary by individual, but everyone on this sub is to some extent awake. But, what do we do about our situation? What CAN we do? We know we are getting screwed, so do we call for more and better lube? Lower taxes, perhaps? A better healthcare system? If you do not pay your taxes in protest, they will lock you up and you will lose everything eventually. You can try to drop out of society, but the underclass holds no attractions for me. Being homeless is a young man&#39;s game. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess you never heard of James Files.  </p>

<p>I&#39;ll focus on some facts known about RFK&#39;s murder for you.</p>

<ul>
<li>Powder burns on Kennedy&#39;s clothing reveal that all three of his wounds were from a gun fired from 0 to 1-1/2 inches away. And yet, all witnesses claim that Sirhan, who was in front of Kennedy, never got closer than three feet away.</li>
<li>Sirhan&#39;s gun could hold only eight bullets. Seven bullets were removed from victims, an eighth bullet was traced through two ceilings into airspace, and two more bullets were identified as lodged in the door frame of the pantry by both LAPD and FBI personnel.</li>
<li>Three bullets were found in Robert Kennedy, and a fourth grazed his suit jacket. The upward angle of each trajectory was close to 80 degrees. And yet, all witnesses claim Sirhan&#39;s gun was completely horizontal for his first two shots, after which his gun hand was repeatedly slammed against the top of a steam table.</li>
<li>All four shots; the fatal penetration to the brain, the shot that passed through the right shoulder pad of the Senator&#39;s coat, and two additional bullets that entered Kennedy&#39;s body were all fired from the back and all produced powder residue patterns which indicated that they were all fired from a distance of only a few inches. Since RFK was walking towards Sirhan, and his body was always facing Sirhan during the shots even as he fell backwards it is impossible these shots originated from Sirhan&#39;s weapon.</li>
</ul>

<p>I hope you&#39;re not someone who is confused by facts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The connections people have made about Rich have to do with content from the Clinton campaign, particularly campaign chairman John Podesta.</p>

<p>In one of his leaked emails he comments on &quot;making an example of leakers.&quot;  In the new book &quot;shattered&quot; it was revealed that he and campaign manager Robby Mook devised the Russia narrative the day after the election.  If it is revealed that Seth Rich was a whistleblower who leaked the DNC emails, then that blows up the Russia narrative that the DNC has been coasting on.  Add to this the fact that Assange has not only alluded to Rich being the leaker, but that he also offered a reward for any info that could lead to Rich&#39;s killer.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying this theory is real, but Assange&#39;s involvement makes it seem like Rich was likely to have been the leaker.  Whether or not he was killed for this is another story.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d say Malcolm was killed for religious/influence reasons because the Nation of Islam were sick of his shit. And George Wallace? Fuck George Wallace. He was killed by a disgruntled fellow neo-Nazi, that&#39;s justice if I&#39;ve ever heard it. </p>

<p>That said, everyone you just named was a <em>major</em> figure in American politics at the time of their deaths, not completely unknown staffers who may or may not have emailed a website. They stirred a whole lot of shit at the center of the American eye before they were snuffed out. </p>

<p>But I also don&#39;t conflate the DNC with the US government which includes the massive end-all be-all powers of the CIA, NSA, FBI, etc. Which I&#39;m guessing this post is about Seth Rich, and I just don&#39;t buy that fucking Nancy Pelosi and Clinton had this guy killed because of one completely unsubstantiated article by Fox News. </p>

<p>The Seth Rich story is clearly a disinformation campaign to distract from the latest scandals for Trump and the GOP.  Fox news got wrapped up in it because they are as stupid as their viewerbase. The guy that first spread the story is now back peddling so fast and the family has told Fox and anyone else spreading the story to fuck off. Anyone still spreading that story is either so detached from reality or lacks a soul as they are willing to torture a family that has already suffered so much just for political points. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have absolutely no doubt that folks get murdered over information and political movements.</p>

<p>I was pretty convinced that Seth Rich was murdered over politics. Still am.</p>

<p>I also think that the focus on him almost a year later is nothing but calculated deflection.</p>

<p>The claimed number of reported emails and attachments on his laptop are not proof. Those numbers have been public forever.</p>

<p>We have new info on the investigation breaking multiple times a day. Real convenient that NOW people want to focus on a year old story.</p>

<p>It is also convenient that it pins the leak as internal, supposedly destroying the Russia narrative, as if it clears all the other sketchy Russia shit. Great totally natural timing, eh?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what the truth is, but it is really fucking clear that powers that be are desperately trying to drown the other&#39;s narrative out. If you aren&#39;t skeptical of both sides, you&#39;re naive.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What makes you think he was murdered over politics? All the info that got out now has been proven false (connections to wikileaks, mysterious laptop in the FBI, etc), the police said they have evidence it was a botched robbery, but they still haven&#39;t catched the culprit, hence why the case isn&#39;t closed yet. Rich told no one he felt threatened or took any measures to protect himself. A presidential candidate (or even worse, one of the two biggest political parties in the US) having someone murdered and for no good reason (and that&#39;s assuming he was the one who leaked the DNC emails) is very unlikely to say the least, so we&#39;d need real, crystal clear proof for this be credible but literally the only connection to Hillary/DNC we have is that he worked there.

    <div class="md"><p>Well it certainly wouldn&#39;t be the first time a botched robbery ended with the attacker fleeing the scene without stealing anything for various reasons (gun being discharged by mistake/misuse, being scared of being recognized because of the noise and/or possible witnesses, not finding anything to steal immediately, being high on drugs, etc). It&#39;s also worth noting the neighborhood where he was shot had been plagued by numerous robberies at the time according to the police and they estimate he was shot at roughly 4 am, plus his watch strap was torn which indicates the attacker did try to steal his watch but gave up. Also according to his girlfriend there was a struggle before or shortly after he was shot and he was still alive when the police found him, so if that was an assassination attempt, it was executed very poorly to say the least. </p>

<p>It has been said that Murder is as American as Apple Pie and there is enough truth in this that <em>no one should suspend their ability to accept the commonality of it</em>.</p>

<p>That&#39;s a very interesting turn of phrase.  You are either an English language poet or a very literate speaker of a foreign language.  </p>

<p>&quot;... <em>no one should suspend their ability to accept the commonality</em>...&quot;  This is a highly clever logical structure.  So clever, in fact, so original, that I suspect it is an approximate transliteration of an idiomatic phrase from some other language.  Probably Russian.  Maybe even from Dostoevsky.</p>

<p>If I were cynical, I would say this post was a blatant attempt to whitewash political murders committed on behalf of dictatorial regimes (like Russia) with a substance derived from a long history of political violence in a truly free Republic.</p>

<p>But I am American.  And everyone knows Americans lack the self awareness of cynics.</p>

<p>I guess if you&#39;re hanging out on here you take it as read the assassinations you list were all the result of well organized conspiracies among your ruling classes but most people find the line that they were the work of lone-wolf crazies perfectly plausible as, you know, your country is full of heavily armed nut jobs.

    <div class="md"><p>Even though all of this info is out there, it&#39;s really hard to get to the actual truth of any matter regards this topic. People who are killing others who have the ability to cover it up are not announcing their activities. No one is ever caught or convicted and if they are they are fall guys, paid to take the fall and direct all the heat away from themselves.</p>

<p>It&#39;s important not to confuse the nutcases with those motivated by politics/power/money but there is a clear pattern that points to a group of elite who don&#39;t want the party to stop and who use our own behaviour against us, controlling large swathes of the earth and it occupants for their own gain. It&#39;s in their interests to divide and rule, keep the fear going, pitting fellow man against fellow man. Whilst we are all distracted by a non stop tide of headlines and bad news, they pilfer what is rightly ours and use us as an endless supply of labour to carry out their dirty work. From basic labouring to fighting their wars. Then they bet on the outcome and double insure for safety meaning they can never lose. They created the game, they control the game, if you take them on you&#39;ll be another in a long line of dead people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The other side of that coin is: some people find it hard to accept that sometimes bad things happen because of an individual&#39;s shitty decision, and that every death isn&#39;t the result of a vast conspiratorial web of puppet masters tugging on delicate threads to kill someone. I have no doubt that politically-motivated assassinations happen. But I think some people have trouble accepting that life is so random. It&#39;s scary. Much easier to tell yourself that &#39;guns don&#39;t kill people; the Clintons do.&#39;</p>

<p>Why was Oswald seen by <em>multiple witnesses</em> in New Orleans and Clinton, Louisiana with CIA assets David Ferrie and Clay Shaw, who both denied (the latter under oath) they ever met him?</p>

<p>Why, on December 8, 1999, did a civil jury in Memphis conclude, based on the testimony of <em>multiple</em> witnesses and the taped confession of one of the conspirators, that there had been a conspiracy to kill Dr. King?</p>

<p>Why was police security systematically removed from the event where Malcom X spoke despite warnings of a planned attack on him?</p>

<p>Why did the medical examiner conclude that RFK had been killed by a point-blank shot from behind when Sirhan was several feet in front of him? Why were there fourteen bullets found in the pantry when Sirhan only fired 8 shots? Why was he seen shortly before the shooting in the company of a woman who was later seen giddily shouting <em>&quot;We did it! We shot him!&quot;</em> and why did the LAPD attempt to coerce the witness who attested to this into changing her story?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.thekingcenter.org/assassination-conspiracy-trial">http://www.thekingcenter.org/assassination-conspiracy-trial</a></p>

<p>The following is a description of the civil trial verdict, published in the New York Times on 12-10-1999: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The jury in Memphis declared Mr. Jowers liable in Dr. King&#39;s death for having purportedly hired a now-dead Memphis police officer, as part of a vast conspiracy, to kill Dr. King. It also found that unnamed others, including government agencies, had been involved, in effect accepting the plaintiffs&#39; contention that James Earl Ray was innocent, despite his guilty plea.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is what I don&#39;t get about the deep state talk.  Big /s here but </p>

<p>JFK was a democratic president assassinated and replaced by a conservative DINO.</p>

<p>His brother ran for president and was assassinated before he would&#39;ve inevitably been the popular candidate for the left and possibly unified the country in a troubled time.</p>

<p>9/11 secured George W. Bush perhaps the largest amount of political capital in American history.</p>

<p>If there is a deep state it&#39;s either playing both sides extremely dirty or just not on the side you guys think it is.  </p>

Most recently, I am still haunted by the murder of Philip Marshall AND his kids.  Or how about the guy who accused Ted Cruz<code>s father of being in the CIA with Oswald.  Really, this crap is ubiquitous.  They get away with it, and are emoldened further.  People need to take these mysterious deaths more seriously.  The key is to start taking accusations of assassination seriously and not dismissing them as</code>conspiracy`theories.  When circumstances are mysterious and puzzling, I would bet that 9 out of 10 incidents are deliberate assassinations. It goes on all the time. </p>

<p>It&#39;s just how people get and hold power. They need to gather support, recruit followers, convert opponents, and remove obstacles they can&#39;t convince to move. If you can&#39;t get around them, they need to be ignored by the masses, silenced, or removed.</p>

<p>Trying to convince oneself that we are somehow above that is absurd. No matter who is in charge, there will be obstacles, and some of those won&#39;t be solved without dismantling them. Occasionally a human obstacle will be too stubborn to coerce.</p>

<p>It&#39;s no conspiracy, it&#39;s reality.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t realize Bobby announced the assassination of MLK at an event until I just watched a documentary. Can you imagine, after his brother and then MLK, the fear he must have carried? My aunt spoke to Bobby and Sirhan the night of his death, and my mom was home watching it LIVE. I can&#39;t imagine. </p>

<p>I mean, I sometimes think about bombs in public and at political rallies, it kinda pops up a little (more mistrust of police or a riot, than of a lonegun man), but I can&#39;t imagine all the assassinations, Kent State and even the Buddhist monks, what that was like on TV back then. No movie or show was as violent as reality. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea, I&#39;m not sure myself as to where Long&#39;s morality resides.</p>

<p>He grew up poor in relative to his time period and environment, kind of had a &quot;off and on again&quot; relationship in the private sector but campaigned in politics for the little guy against the State Establishment, albeit using less than reputable means like they all do,(I myself would have rather enjoyed his verbal and non-verbal attacks on his opponents).</p>

<p>He was a politician; one that was so good that LBJ looked up at him.</p>

<p>What makes me question his morality is his attacks against the occupations of non-political members when trying to gain the upper hand over others.</p>

<p>Or his interactions with the University and the people within the University of which he held a fondness for.</p>

They seem to have education figured out. The US could have modeled their system, but chose to make up some new pile of crap, with committees of unqualified goons, sending us down the education toilet.<br/>
The US could have modeled any decent national system, or modeled any decent upper class private system, but went for experimental whims, based around committees of morons, and lots of microsoft profit.<br/>
Watch as American kids learn to have more feelings, and world citizenship programming, when we could have easily modeled a successful system.<br/>
It will only cost a trillion to belly flop into a cesspool of faeces.</p>
