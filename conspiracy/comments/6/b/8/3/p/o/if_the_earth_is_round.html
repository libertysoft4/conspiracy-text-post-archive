        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>If the earth is round and spinning on its axis, as we were taught in school, why is gravity constant all over the globe?</p>

<p>Spinning objects like gyroscopes, merry-go rounds and even rowing oars are governed by what is called <em>angular momentum</em> in physics.</p>

<p>It basically works like this. If you take a tiny 1inch diameter propeller and spun it up to 1000 rpm you would generate a relatively small disturbance in the air. If you took a propeller the length of a football field and spun it up to 1000 rpm it would produce some insane hurricane type force of wind. The same rpm produces a much greater force for the same rpm. </p>

<p>Furthermore, the amount of force at the edge of the rotor blade is far, far greater than at the axis. If you&#39;ve ever touched the spokes of a free spinning bicycle tire you can feel how much more force they have toward the rim than they do toward the axis. Spinning objects also generate centrifigal force. This is why your laundry is plastered to the insides of the washing machine when you take your clothes out. </p>

<p>Consider the size of what they claim is the globe spinning. Even though it takes 24 hours to rotate, the angular momentum and therefore the centrifugal force is basically unbelieveable. I may include a video that shows the velocity on smaller rotating object. It&#39;s something like a heavy prop airplane rotating at 3000 rpm. Try hanging on to a prop the size of you, spinning at 3000 rpm, you would go flying and there&#39;s not a damn thing gravity could do about it.</p>

<p>The spinning ball earth would be generating that same level of centrifugal force at the equator. That centrifugal force would be <em>directly</em> countering gravity at the equator. If you went to the North Pole there would be no perpendicular force countering gravity. The much lower force would be pulling you in a sideways direction.  </p>

<p>Therefore on a spinning ball earth you would see a much lower force of gravity at the equator than at the pole due to the counter acting nature of centrifugal force due to the enormous angular momentum of the earth at the equator.</p>

You simply aren&#39;t big enough to feel gravity differently on this planet. No one is saying it&#39;s perfectly round, but you&#39;re too insignificant to feel the imperfection through gravity. I&#39;m not sure what your point is here? </p>

<p>So even if you went to the exact pole and experienced no centripetal force, you&#39;d only experiencing about 3N more force pulling you towards the surface, a change of about 0.04ms<sup>-1</sup> more effective gravity. So yes, you would weigh slightly less at the equator than the poles, but not by enough to notice.</p>
