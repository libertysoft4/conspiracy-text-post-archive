    <div class="md"><p>people with anxiety problems often fiddle with things. clicking pens. twirling coins. foot tapping. rhythmic tapping on a desk. People with ADHD often deal with that. People with autism deal with it too. So much so that they call it &quot;stimming&quot;.</p>

<p>fidget spinners fulfill that craving without bothering the fuck out of everyone else. I don&#39;t like them but there&#39;s a guy at my work that used to click pens in meetings and now he just spins his little thing under the table. much less annoying. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s just a stupid distraction dude...These things are so goofy and they will be over with soon enough. </p>

<p>It is probably also another thing to bring attention to people with ADHD and autism. I&#39;ve seen posts from SJW&#39;s on Facebook about people being &quot;offended&quot; by people who use them, because they say;</p>

<p>&quot;You don&#39;t know what it&#39;s like to be autistic and actually have ADHD you can&#39;t use them!&quot; </p>

<p>Thus creating an outrage from other people, a big argument ensues, and more division and tension is created between us. Just as they plan.</p>

<p>I think they&#39;e goofy...I think they&#39;re running out of fucking ideas. </p>

<p>Pogs were stupid..But this shit is even goofier.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>TBH so many people are wrongly diagnosed with ADHD, I don&#39;t even know if &#39;they&#39; know what ADHD is anymore... It&#39;s absurd to me that all YouTubers who talk about fidget spinners claim it helps with ADHD because it clearly is just a stupid toy like you said.</p>

<p>Hence the conspiracy... These big trusted YouTubers wouldn&#39;t just be claiming this dumb piece of plastic can heal, unless there&#39;s something up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There should be no claim of healing as it is only meant to redirect impulse and nervous energy and allow the user to focus better. You may want to educate yourself a bit on what occupational therapists have to offer in their arsenal of toys to do exactly this for people that had to deal with ADHD. Also, ADHD is not one size fits all to where everyone has the same level of debilitation from it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My son has ADHD and would repetitively flip his cell phones open and closed to the point of wearing out the cables and hinges inside. Same thing with latches, catches, or anything that made an instrumental sound or click. He was born with this. As a baby, he wore out the corners of his pillows by flipping them back and forth. It is a real thing and yes as soon as he saw the spinner he wanted one as a 20 year old.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>TBH so many people are wrongly diagnosed with ADHD, I don&#39;t even know if &#39;they&#39; know what ADHD is anymore... It&#39;s absurd to me that all YouTubers who talk about fidget spinners claim it helps with ADHD because it clearly is just a stupid toy like you said.</p>

<p>Hence the conspiracy... These big trusted YouTubers wouldn&#39;t just be claiming this dumb piece of plastic can heal, unless there&#39;s something up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most do.  That is part of what allows learning plan modifications,  schedule modifications,  medication if needed,  access to outside services and assistance if needed,  as well as legal protection  from discriminatory acts from staff that make have the misperception that a student is being intentionally disrespectful as opposed to an impulse driven medical condition that is every bit as strong as Tourette syndrome though not as obvious. </p>
