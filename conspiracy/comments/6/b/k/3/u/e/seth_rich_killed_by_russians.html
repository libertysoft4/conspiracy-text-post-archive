<p>Seth Rich died 12 days before the Clinton wikileaks reveal.  The current conspiracy theory is that the DNC killed him because of the leaks.</p>

<p>Could it be possible that &#39;Russian agents&#39; who already had the DNC data through their hack, killed Seth Rich to provide a red herring easy explanation for the leaks?</p>

<p>Unless you want to add the DC police to the <em>muh Russians</em> narrative (which would necessitate more investigations), there&#39;s absolutely nothing to this other than to distract from the actual evidence coming out. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>According to an article I read yesterday, the DC police were ordered to stand down in the Seth Rich murder investigation.  </p>

<p><a href="http://dailywesterner.com/news/2017-05-16/seth-rich-may-have-been-killed-for-ties-to-wikileaks-police-were-told-to-stand-down-on-this-case/">http://dailywesterner.com/news/2017-05-16/seth-rich-may-have-been-killed-for-ties-to-wikileaks-police-were-told-to-stand-down-on-this-case/</a></p>

<p>I am not sure what day the order was given, or who gave it.  My guess is it was Cathy L. Lanier or Peter Newsham.  Cathy L. Lanier left the DC police in September of 2016, and Peter Newsham took over.  Peter Newsham is the one who was photographed with James &quot;Why does Daddy like Butt?&quot; Alefantis outside CPP.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Anything is possible really. This place is swarming with Trump lovers who have created yet another fake narrative and are filling the internet with it.</p>

<p>We need to go back to square one. Let&#39;s look at the possibilities:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Seth Rich was killed by HRC operatives after he leaked information that he may or may not have had access to BECAUSE ... because it&#39;s too late! The info already leaked! Killing his would make Republican partisans go crazy on the internet. Hmmm, that doesn&#39;t really work well.</p></li>
<li><p>Pretty much the opposite of the above. Republican operatives killed Seth Rich to create that illusion.</p></li>
<li><p>Russians killed Seth Rich for helping them out with their Trump support. Hmmm, that&#39;s not how you treat your friends.</p></li>
<li><p>Russians killed Seth Rich because they thought he would turn on them. Hmmm, if he did the leak, then he would not likely turn on them -- and if he didn&#39;t -- he would be irrelevant to Russians. So, this one doesn&#39;t work.</p></li>
<li><p>Seth Rich was killed by someone for a non-political purpose.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I think that #2 or #5 make sense and the other three don&#39;t. :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This plot is much much deeper than either &quot;Muh Russians&quot; or &quot;Muh Hillary&quot;. BOTH sides are involved in this.</p>

<p>Russia hacked the DNC, the huge set of data was questionable and unverified. So, what happened next was Seth (a known BernieBro) was somehow convinced through someone to leak to wikipedia about the 1sthand knowledge he had about the voting situation in the Ohio primary, which cost Bernie the primary. So, Seth leaks a small chuck of emails about the Ohio stuff to wikileaks hoping to whisteblow the primary rigging thing. Low-and behold, they match word for word a chuck of data derived in the Russia hack, verifying that data as legitimate. Seth is then killed shortly after.</p>

<p>DNC did it is plausible
Russia did it is also plausible.</p>

<p>personally, i think it was Russian assets that convinced Seth to leak to attempt to vindicate Bernie. They at that point would have known he did it since they helped him do it. Killing him could only implicate the DNC at this point as their involvement(Russia) wasn&#39;t know publicly yet. The man who could explain his reasons for WHY he leaked is now dead.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is Rich a known Berniebro or does it simply fit the narrative to assign him this status? </p>

<p>The rest of your post is very reasonable. It&#39;s worth noting (usually to a deliberately deaf audience) that the DNC thing is not the only hack attributed to Russia-- multiple Dem officials, state voter registration systems, Trump primary opponents. People seem to ignore or forget this fact, which makes sense. </p>

<p>Of course, not only is Rich deceased but this WL-connected guy he&#39;s alleged to have emailed is also dead. Alot of this thus far is dead men getting stuffed with partisan agendas, and wink-winks from Assange (which he also apparently did with Pizzagate). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It could actually be very simple:</p>

<p>Republicans cause 9-11 to happen so they could blame someone else, namely Osama bi Ladin and build an elaborate fake conspiracy around it.</p>

<p>Republicans killed a relatively low-level Democratic operative so they could blame the Democrats and build an elaborate fake conspiracy around it.</p>

<p>NOT saying this is the final answer. I am only saying that, given the current evidence, or lack thereof, this is as likely as any other. :)</p>
