<p>This got exceptionally poor reception, so lets experiment.</p>

<p>I am not a politically apt person. However it&#39;s so pervasive now that i feel we should address it. Not per say as a conspiracy though it could be construed as one. We are not bound by the processes invented by in which we declare our leader. In fact we have the right to say anything and petition for anything we desire. So allow me to pose this..</p>

<p>We do not have to stand idle and allow Trump to be Commander and Chief. No i am not referencing impeachment, as he has not been proven to committing an impeachable offense. I&#39;m simply stating we can oppose anyone elected into office, and claim &quot;We do not want you to be our president&quot;. Article 2 section 1 clause 6 of the constitution permits congress to make a case for this. It is then up to the senate and house to decide the validity of claims for and against this process. And via the Presidential Succession Act congress will have to decide who can hold the position of POTUS. Simply put <strong>we the people</strong> have the right to a motion of no confidence. They would have you believe this is not possible. However it is written into our constitution. </p>

<p>Our rights, and elected officials responsibilities are suppressed, not overtly, subversively in how we are taught, conditioned and coerced.  </p>

<p>The constitution is a real thing, and it binds us as citizens of this nation. </p>

<p>Thank you to all who participated. This was fun. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If your resentment for Trump is so much so that you are willing to forgo the logic about what you are proposing, then they have won - their game of emotion has you by the balls.</p>

<p>If you want to get rid of Trump, and NOT see another stooge installed, I recommend you quit playing the outrage game, and start looking into suppressed technology that these folks in this sub are disemminating: r/new_American_system</p>

<p>Its not enough to just be outraged and demand a different president and expect anything resembling true change.  The system overall needs a facelift, and major infrastructural projects like these are the type of things that create growth and solve all sorts of problems </p>

Because it is so obvious to other countries looking in that we are a conquered people, but its no apparent to us because we&#39;re the oppressed</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wouldn&#39;t be opposed to that. I am certain that&#39;s why he&#39;s VP. There&#39;s a bigger secret behind Pence than any of this trump bs. Look into Pence, realize Paul Ryan would be VP in this scenario. And you think hillary lost.. ha, This has been planned since Trump gained traction in the polls. The bigger secret is privatized war profiteering and national indiscretion to foreign acquisitions by congress. Our whole system is fucked. I know that that. Trump is going nowhere. This was all a test. Im feeling particularly feisty today. So here&#39;s a fun one for you. Trump will go.. the question is to what end? War, peace, dismemberment of the empire, or maybe he will just go golfing. </p>
