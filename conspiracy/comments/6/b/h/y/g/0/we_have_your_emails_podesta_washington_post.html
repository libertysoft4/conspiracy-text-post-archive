<p>BARRY.. did plenty of strange things, like &quot; accidentally&quot; calling Michelle &quot;Michael.&quot;</p>

<p>You linked me his tweet in your strange writing fashion, but nothing in it says classified information.  If you think delegates from Russia and the USA meeting in the WH are just going to trade jokes and sip some vodka rather than exchange information via dialogue then you aren&#39;t thinking clearly. There is no mention of classified information being shared. </p>

<p>Weird is subjective. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>That is because what he disclosed was classified until he exposed it to the Russians.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Do they trade information that other countries expected us to not to rely to Russia on? With that being said, trying to get closer to Russia is the last thing that our country should be worrying about, imo.</p>

<p>It&#39;s gossip.  People should really know better than to rely on tabloids for news.  They&#39;re all about senstationalism, not about actual reporting.  </p>

<p>Until the WaPo can pull something else out as evidence <em>besides</em> vague allusions to U.S. officials, there&#39;s really noting to go on here.  Especially when there&#39;s several <em>named</em> officials who are saying this is B.S.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Nowhere does this say anything about intelligence leaks.  He&#39;s talking about passage of routine info to Russian officials because he wanted to step up cooperation.  It&#39;s tabloids like WaPo that tried to make a mountain out of a molehill.</p>
