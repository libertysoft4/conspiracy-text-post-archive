<p>EDITS:</p>

<p>like on the real though, actual conspiracy theorists dont buy into the two-party dichotomous nonsense. If you really want to know who runs the show, its multi-national corporations and financial institutions. Thats how we can deduce the shills, if youre pushing the political narrative - you know its coming from a horses mouth thats feeding you shit. horseshit. </p>

<p>Obligatory link to the censored RT sponsored 3rd party presidential debates in 2012 hosted by Larry King... you didnt hear about it because of the media blackout? It was probably some russian propoganda anyway /s..:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EcaX12h46k">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EcaX12h46k</a>  (debate starts about an hour in)</p>

<p>Oh, and about one of the counterpoints that sort of initiated this post - Wouldnt it be in the best interests of the world if the most powerful countries such as Russia and USA were sharing intel on ISIS, a terrorist state?!!! come on... unless tptb dont want russia learning about the operations of Israeli Secret Intelligence Services: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9ubCPIHrPQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9ubCPIHrPQ</a></p>

<p>Also note: The President of the United States is the only person authorized to release classified information without getting advance clearance or permission to do so. In fact, he can wave his hand and declare classified information to be declassified at any time. </p>

Sometimes I wonder if I&#39;m biased because those are all admittedly democrats and their organization, but they just seem to be the most blatantly evil over and over and over, so if you collect blatantly evil things, it seems like you collect things that somehow involve the democratic party a lot of the time. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>haha I&#39;m 29. I remember all the shady shit, and now that you mention it it was mostly repubs back then. I guess it was just that I became aware of the fucked up parts of the world while a democrat presided over it all. </p>

<p>Still though, there&#39;s not been anything so blatantly fucked up as how the DNC/media/<em>our own president</em> handled this last election, right? I mean that&#39;s directly attributable to the republican party, not just stuff that was done by republicans or concurrent to when we had a republican president. I guess maybe that&#39;s where the feeling comes from. That and I really hate their PC &quot;white men are the devil&quot; rhetoric. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Since you&#39;re asking about it, my own personal experience with the Republican party started in 2008 when I started doing volunteer work for the Ron Paul campaign. I followed that campaign very closely, and was in contact with other members of the campaign around the country. Everyone I knew who was part of the Paul campaign talked about how horribly they were being treated by the Republican establishment in general within their states. Just go watch those early debates where Ron Paul faces off against people like Giuliani on stage. The party HATED Ron Paul. It was very similar to the way we saw the DNC treat Sanders this last election. Honestly, I thought the Republicans treated Paul even worse than the DNC treated Sanders.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The biggest problem is that while the real issues to tackle are not partisan, there is no option to actually ELECT somebody not playing that game. The other issue is that on the left, there is a complete regression from actual liberal ideologies. The left has regressed into this bizarre marxist-communist social and moral relativist institution of cultural subversion, while the right is devolving into disparate groups of everything from literal nazis to people who just don&#39;t deny basic biology and don&#39;t embrace every tenet of complete moral relativism. </p>

<p>I guess the bottom line is its difficult to move past republican vs democrat when they are the only two options. Not that either will screw you any less.</p>

<p>The solution is education, but it&#39;s not easy and it&#39;s not quick.  There are more people who don&#39;t vote than who vote for any one candidate, and there are a shit ton of people who only voted for one party or the other because they felt they had no other choice.</p>

<p>The idea of massive, powerful government controlling every aspect of life is absurd.  These morons can&#39;t even pass legislation regularly and pretty much everything in the US is falling apart.  They have power over small groups and that&#39;s it, and the reason they have that power is because the American people are lazy and apathetic.</p>

<p>As far as Im concerned, anyone who wants to denounce the russia theory is dishonest. Theyd have to start from this point for me: did russia try to influence our election and the french election? if the response is I dont know or there is no proof then we dont have a lot in common. Disregarding the intelligence agencies and what we can see and interact with ourselves on twitter, here, and fb just reeks of dishonesty and ulterior motives.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There was no substantial evidence for &#39;russiagate&#39; and it appeared from the ether only shortly after major revelations via Wikileaks. The media echoed off itself to bolster its position against trump/russia while simultaneously discrediting &#39;conspiracist&#39; and self investigation. Showergate was especially ludicrous. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve already stated I&#39;m not pro trump; being a business tycoon I&#39;m sure he&#39;s dirty to some degree. As dirty as the rest of them? We&#39;ll see, they seem to mingle in separate circles. </p>

<p>Russia has little to gain from rigging our elections and the initial &#39;russian hack&#39; (if there was one; i believe the whole hacking was retroactively fabricated) was actually the CIA who have interfered with plenty of elections so it&#39;s not far fetched they could meddle in our especially this being an oligarchy and all that</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure I agree with you that because Russiagate appeared after Wikileaks that it is therefore false. I don&#39;t see how that discredits the Wikileaks revelations, more explains them.  </p>

<p>Russia has an immense amount to gain by implementing Trump, from reducing economic sanctions on Russia, to having a pro-isolationist President in the White House Russia has more space to move into on the global political scene.  </p>

<p>I mentioned it elsewhere today but read through this: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics</a>  </p>

<p>And again, when you go back a few months regarding Russia&#39;s role in the election it was not liberal media and the DNC that accused Russia but a large amount of intelligence agencies: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_interference_in_the_2016_United_States_elections#U.S._intelligence_analysis">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_interference_in_the_2016_United_States_elections#U.S._intelligence_analysis</a>  </p>

<p>CIA, GCHQ, Department of Homeland Security, FBI etc, all said there was evidence there. This, if I&#39;m honest, is more conspiracy worthy than any narrative regarding the role the media players. Either the intelligence agencies worked against the President and faked evidence of highly sensitive hacking from a long standing enemy nation, or the President was helped into office by a long standing enemy nation. Either is terrifying. </p>

<p>This is a summary of all that is wrong with this sub. People have gone beyond believing, wholeheartedly, in the two-party system - they literally believe one party is satanists raping children and the other is doing all they can for the little man. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>But the problem is you could say that about ANY message. You could call someone a shill for supporting Clinton and that shills are paid to support Clinton. You could call someone a shill for supporting the Green Party (which I do support, full disclosure), because the Koch brothers helped finance them in certain states to pull votes from Democrats. You could call someone a shill for supporting Trump. You can be a pro-Russian or anti-Russian shill, as both of those exist. </p>

<p>Calling someone a shill is just noise. If you have actual evidence that someone is a shill (like them forgetting the switch accounts or something), then you&#39;ve got something to go on. </p>

<p>When I first joined Reddit on my last account, this sub was much less dismissive of people and opinions (it was also way more focused, at least it seemed to me, on the shadowy activities of corporations -- but this is anecdotal on my part so it&#39;s mostly worthless). There is literally a post on the front page that is a screenshot of a 4chan post. I think that because the mainstream is actively looking into conspiracy related to Trump, this sub, as a pseudo-counterculture/fringe (I don&#39;t mean that as a negative) group, goes full contrarian. &quot;The mainstream is considering Trump conspiracies, which means the REAL conspiracies involve Trump&#39;s enemies&quot; - is basically the way this sub feels sometimes. </p>

<p>The South Korean leader is meeting with Trump and nobody on this sub has talked about or mentioned the way that, for example, his insistence on them pursuing nuclear weapons coincides with his business relationships to companies that would get those government contracts. But that&#39;s not sexy and has no infographs and requires a little bit of digging, so nobody cares. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nah man, you <em>could</em> say that about any message, but it wouldn&#39;t be true unless shills fought for it, too. It would just be a lot of hot air. </p>

<p>You should know, though: There aren&#39;t very many confirmed shill organizations. There are a few for the left, a very large concerted nation-wide effort going on in Israel, and that&#39;s pretty much all we know definitively. </p>

<p>It&#39;s just going to be a thing that people who are sensitive to patterns are going to recognize when there are inorganic messages being attempted to be passed off as organic ones, and they&#39;re going to call you a shill if you fall for it when everyone else doesn&#39;t. Maybe it&#39;s too tough of a learning curve for some, but it&#39;s the way it has to be until we get some sort of legislation in the works to allow us to fight back against them. I&#39;m working on a few ideas...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know that Russia has state sponsored shill activity which was proven by leaked documents from 2011/2012. Would you be able to give me a source on the ones from the left / Israel? Any searching for Israel brings up some blatantly unsourced crackpot stuff with anti-semetic undertones and the left one is a little too vague. </p>

<p>Also, would right wing brigading from 4chan constitute shilling to you? Because it is pretty clear that that has been a phenomenon of the past year or so, but without profit being a part of it. </p>

<p>Many/most people come to their own conclusions on things but according to these people every human on reddit/elsewhere is being paid to post their opinion. It&#39;s a cop-out and an attempt to weasel out of admitting other people don&#39;t believe their BS.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And why would they use an amateur? The way <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> talks Hillary has connections to the CIA and Private Military industry as well as other intelligence services and can afford a professional. </p>

<p>Logically they have no reason to use anyone that would leave evidence at the scene and yet all this is predicated on evidence left at the scene; A professional would also make sure that anything of value was gone so investigators would assume robbery gone wrong. </p>

<p>He was found at 4:19 in the morning apparently after refusing a ride from the bar where he was drinking and was found by officers on patrol who reported hearing gunshots - thus it is unlikely he would have his laptop but his wallet and cell phone, as well as his watch and keys, were still on the body. Whoever shot rich had plenty of time to search his body and relieve him of his valuables as well as evidence, and a professional would have taken those things, as he would need the keys to secure Rich&#39;s laptop from his home, as well as further lead investigators to believe robbery gone wrong.</p>

<p>It&#39;s all very problematic, as rich people don&#39;t need to hire amateur hour weekend warriors from the back of soldier of fortune - they hire professionals that cover their tracks, And this seems like someone who wasn&#39;t worried about evidence or investigative doubt.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why leave evidence that would point back to them and aid investigators, unless some other party had Rich Shot and have no interest other than muddying the waters and introducing doubt? 
Maybe someone in the DNC did it, but not for the reasons espoused, ( like a personal vendetta ) or it was another party altogether. </p>

<p>It&#39;s increasing hard to imagine the Clinton foundation employing amateurs when they are already under the microscope especially considering their wealth and reach, while I imagine the DNC would have the Clinton foundation&#39;s resources at their disposal and would likely leave them to choose who to employ. </p>

<p>Honestly, it&#39;s more likely that if either group is guilty, the decision was taken and executed by a compartmentalized group within the organization that might have the implicit support of whoever is in charge ( they would be an invisible part of that organization ) but operates outside their purview to contain the possible collateral damage and fallout. </p>

<p>That&#39;s how a group like that would operate within any of the letter agencies and those agencies would be the most likely sources of those groups personnel. </p>

<p>And if that is the case, any investigation would see these people charged with the crime, as Hillary or whoever would have plausible deniability. Whoever is in charge might not even know Themselves if it was someone within their organization as they would never be part of the decision process or even have personally met the people involved.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I dont have a problem with 1% who made their money and aren&#39;t part of the wars and manipulating that go on in the stock market, banks, options, etc. But that&#39;s fairly rare.</p>

<p>Also, if you make a certain amount it&#39;s only right you give back to the community. 1 person really doesn&#39;t need more than a billion anyway. Once you have your mansions, car collection, whores, businesses, drugs, and restaurants after a while you get older, wiser, evolve and realize it&#39;s good to give back.</p>

<p>In the past the 1%ers always gave back in big ways and while our capitalist system has gotten us and the world to where it is today, it is no longer suitable because it doesn&#39;t give a shit about ethics, morals, values, and people. It creates this atmosphere where the most important thing is the bottom line to the stock owners no matter the costs, the pollution, deaths, ethics, oil spills, etc. It&#39;s profit at all cost.</p>

<p>I just watched a brilliant documentary I&#39;ll see if I can link it here. It was about how Western capitalism created a movement in Japan of workers putting their jobs, bosses, company first and working God awful 19-20 your days leading to the deaths and health decline in many workers due to exhaustion. This is what capitalism does, or rather it&#39;s dark side is that it doesn&#39;t give a shit about the individual.</p>

<p>No we are seeing efficient collectives rise up like uber/lyft, decentralization of news via citizen reporters and currency like cryptocurrencies. Some grocery store and other chains are being made to be employee owned. Things are rapidly changing and the old capitalism is on the way out to be replaced by something new much more efficient, inclusive of more people, ethics, values, etc. Also A.I. robotics will absolutely upend the system</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m so tired of the shills here. Every time we get a decently upvoted post in our sub, it gets flooded with shills that have either never been here before or have no idea that we don&#39;t trust <em>anything</em> we&#39;re told. I&#39;m highly suspicious that they&#39;re an army of low-wage Washington Post employees.</p>

<p>They then flood the comments and yap at each other on and on about Russia or whatever and call anyone that doesn&#39;t have the Washington Post logo tattooed on their eyelids a Trump supporter. Their MSM rhetoric gets a ton of suspicious upvotes real fast and then the original conversation is buried and turned into another r/politics talking point festival. </p>

<p>The Stargate posts were fun because the shills have no interest in anything fun and we can talk about interesting things without having to deal with their robotic script bullshit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Double-edged sword. I don&#39;t think you should be allowed to literally shill for a corporation on the internet without disclosing yourself, but there are also people that exist that truly believe in the MSM and think they tell the truth. When you truly <em>believe</em> something, it&#39;s very difficult to unbelieve. You can go to r/politics on any given day and find people that just seep adoration and applause for the CIA Washington Post and have literally no idea that they&#39;re being mass manipulated.</p>

<p>Generally in this sub we benefit from not having to worry about MSM programmed robots.. until a big story drops. When that happens, everything goes right out the fucking window and the resident Washington Post retards flood the place and there&#39;s nothing we can do about it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s why you have a law that they have to identify themselves when asked. You would be respectful about it, just a quick &quot;hey are you a shill by chance?&quot;, then if they aren&#39;t, they could just say nah, and if they didn&#39;t respond, you could take them to court once you had proof that they were a shill. </p>

<p>You could make it to where any corporation that employs them must keep a record of all the usernames associated with them in a public database, also. </p>

<p>With those two laws, if a shill didn&#39;t answer you and they were a shill, you could take them to court, and if they did answer you and they weren&#39;t a registered shill, you could take them to court. Also of course there would be hefty fines that the corporation would be subject to, as well. </p>

A shill is an individual who is paid to manipulate public opinion by assuming the role of an average and ostensibly sincere user on any number of platforms, whether online or in the media. It&#39;s what is known in the advertising world as &quot;influence marketing&quot;, and it has been especially prevalent in all forms of online social media in particular since the election.

I will always try and find the truth, with all evidence and information presented. r/conspiracy is the most scrupulous bunch of people i have ever met, and yet when anything involving politics is presented on r/conspiracy the name calling is intensified by 300 fold!!!

<p>Family statement: &quot;Even if tomorrow an email was found, it is not a high enough bar of evidence to prove any interactions as emails can be altered, and we&#39;ve seen that those interested in pushing conspiracies will stop at nothing to do so.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We are a family who is committed to facts, not fake evidence that surfaces every few months to fill the void and distract law enforcement and the general public from finding Seth&#39;s murderers. The services of the private investigator who spoke to press was offered to the Rich family and paid for by a third party, and contractually was barred from speaking to press or anyone outside of law enforcement or the family unless explicitly authorized by the family.&quot; </p>

<p>The only named source is a PI. They provide one unnamed source currently in law enforcement.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It just happens to be the exact same number of Hillary&#39;s spirit cooking emails.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Gee, seems awfully convenient, doesn&#39;t it ? Almost as if someone (who has admitted that they are not neutral on the matter) is trying to manufacture an orgy of evidence. Why would Rich, if indeed he was sending emails to Wikileaks, <em>only</em> send those? And if that&#39;s what he sent, then what happens to the story that he was Wikileaks&#39; source for the whole thing?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>AND Juilian Assange himself retweeted this report.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, because he&#39;s a paragon of neutrality. Certainly not the opportunistic sort. He can&#39;t have it both ways, trying to make Rich look like the source for the whole thing and now trying to make it look like Rich sent just those emails.</p>

<p>The &quot;private investigator&quot; is a professional Fox News pundit.  He is even fraudulently representing himself as a PI in DC and lying about being hired by the Rich family.  </p>

<p>So we have two paid shills, from either side, swooping down on this poor family.  Literally coming out of the woodwork just to make noise in the system with nothing of substance to add to the story.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, what&#39;s happening on this subreddit right now is a perfect, glaring example of controlled propaganda. The MOMENT damaging evidence comes out pointing to a massive, legit, bonafide conspiracy inside the White House, a discarded, discredited and forgotten footnote from the presidential campaign gets brought up out of the blue and dominates all discussion here. I&#39;ve never seen such a rapid shift in discourse on any reddit community that isn&#39;t non-organic manipulation. </p>

<p>I guess you can want justice for Seth all you want, and that&#39;s cool and all, but why all of a sudden? Is there any new evidence? Any new bombshell hard evidence (or hard evidence at all for that matter)? Why is this being dug up after not reaching the front page for months? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. </p>

<p>Because the family even came out and said this latest surge in interest on Rich&#39;s death is nothing more than a push from the right-wing media to distract people from Trump&#39;s latest breach and further selling out of America. </p>

<p>Trump is getting his money&#39;s worth in effort, but the truth came out in less than 24 hours - you shills can&#39;t suppress facts, no matter how much money Trump throws at you. </p>

<p>Also, I can&#39;t wait until he refuses to pay you when he realizes you can&#39;t pull off what he paid you to do. I bet then you all pull his dick out from your mouths and start spitting some truth... after you you clear your throats of his old man cock smegma. </p>

<p>The issue is you are all divided on everything by design.</p>

<p>They want you divided.</p>

<p>They want hate.</p>

<p>They want you torn apart by religion and politics and hockey teams.</p>

<p>They want you to buy a shiny new phone every year.</p>

<p>They want you to look the other way as they rape the environment for the shear fact that they can</p>

<p>they take anything they want.</p>

<p>You squabble over the theater of politics.</p>

<p>They laugh as they use your 401K as a way to fund wars and encourage more hate.</p>

We have lost our way.</p>

<p>We have lived under establishment for too long and our ways are set.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was following you unti intelligence talk. I have no clue if Trump really did share anything but if he did it was a biiiig mistake.</p>

<p>a) the ally who shared has an extensive network of personnel deep in ISIS</p>

<p>b) they told the US not to share</p>

<p>Consequences</p>

<p>a) allies intelligence network is destroyed because ISIS has/will destroy it</p>

<p>b) allies will not share the most top secret information</p>

<p>c) agent who got the certain piece of intel is probably in an ISIS torture chamber</p>

<p>Trump could&#39;ve shared the information with Russia low key instead of making a spectacle of it but he did and now he done fucked up. I don&#39;t think anyone is even saying giving out the info was illegal that is not even the argument of anyone, the whole point is that it was a dumbass move.</p>

Anyone with two eyes can see there is a massive push to cover any trump news with Seth rich details, some of them this forum has talked about ad nausiem. Funny enough I do find Seth&#39;s death highly suspicious and I believe the clues point to a government hit. But this conspiracy and murder are being used as propaganda to hide trumps issues right now which highly point to a conspiracy. I don&#39;t think most of the Seth rich posters actually give a shit.
