        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>We can restore the quality of the sub this way. </p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>I say <strong>Republican</strong> specifically because the &quot;provocateurs&quot; are trying to paint and portray our sub as a &quot;right leaning&quot; conservative pro trump sub.</p>

<p>They do this by flooding the &quot;New&quot; queue with links in defense of trumps decisions and cabinet members, as well as upvoting these to the front page. Also wacky crazy religious things, flat earth, ect. They also usually coordinate and massively upvote a few anti Hillary posts or DNC posts as well to tag an &quot;anti left&quot; leaning vibe to us as well.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a few examples just recently </p>

<p><a href="https://postimg.org/image/7jhx0xsld/">https://postimg.org/image/7jhx0xsld/</a></p>

<p><a href="https://postimg.org/image/l0tznhr7r/">https://postimg.org/image/l0tznhr7r/</a></p>

<p>That makes us look like shit ^ </p>

<p>Ever notice why the front page always has at least one post like..</p>

<p><strong>DNC blah blah Hillary Clinton election</strong></p>

<p>...The election is over. This woman is a criminal, however we have a NEW criminal entity currently in power that deserves our full focus.</p>

<p>Also remember the onslaught of anti bill nye posts? They were focusing specifically on his sexual presentation in his show. The provocateurs plastered the front page with anti nye posts, and peppered the comments with words like &quot;libtard&quot; and &quot;snowflakes&quot;. These are things conservatives say. Thjs astroturfing shit makes us look conservative. <strong>I think TPTB are trying to merge the &quot;conspiracy community&quot; with conservatism in the public eye. Alex Jones has even endorsed Trump and is helping usher in this phase of their plan to derail the resistance. The shills are here to enforce that agenda. This will make our cause to wake the masses appear &quot;fringe&quot; and potentially &quot;racist&quot; to the mass left.</strong></p>

<p>When you think about it, it&#39;s stupid as fuck to continue to say, </p>

<p>&quot;But Hillary did this!&quot;</p>

<p>Even after she lost and trump is already pushing ahead with the New World Order agenda. And I know we are smarter than that, which is why I submit that this is all the work of shills and provocateurs. Part of their cleverly crafted narrative and strategy to dissolve our discussion forum.</p>

<p>They try to control the image of the front page, to make the rest of Reddit blow us off and not even give us a chance. They try to make us look like a fucking circus sometimes, but we still prevail. </p>

<p><strong>By politicizing the sub, and giving it the appearance of a &quot;right leaning&quot; forum, they essentially control our potential audience on Reddit. We are discussing serious shit. We are a Non Partisan News Aggregation Site. Let&#39;s keep fighting to preserve it.</strong> </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This place has become a political battleground now. It is not without understanding though as politics touches us all (I post about it).</p>

<p>I posted something about a company to keep an eye on the other day, not a single reply. </p>

<p>My uncle used to post about things here till he was banned over a trump post, but he is mostly old school conspiracies. It seems now everything is politics or people pushing a youtube channel. When I think of Art Bell I think of him, lots of weird and interesting things but this sub is now just defend trump and attack all others.</p>

<p>He goes ghost hunting (and I am going with him next month!) and spent three solid months just getting data on a murder from 1875 and the conspiracy around that (and the local historical society didn&#39;t know all he did, real investigation there, not some weird 4chan source).</p>

<p>But, this sub is reflected by the mods and what they want, so what can you do?</p>
