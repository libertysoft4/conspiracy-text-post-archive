<p>Do you think it is because they think we can&#39;t count?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure they can.. <em>with evidence</em>. We&#39;ve known Hillary is corrupt since the 70&#39;s. The recent red scare was so random and so heavily pushed by MSM that you have to question the validity of it if you have any sort of independent thought running through your own brain. </p>

<p>There&#39;s zero evidence that Russia hacked the DNC, unless you believe word salad that falls out of Hillary Clinton&#39;s mouth. There&#39;s zero evidence that Trump is some Russian plant. </p>

<p>There&#39;s maybe circumstantial evidence, if you believe in conspiracies- that Trump, Tillerson, and Exxon could be working with Russia to get the U.S. in on the Syrian pipeline deal.. but that&#39;s about it. I wouldn&#39;t put it past them to do that, but I also wouldn&#39;t care if it were true. The idea that Russia is our enemy is absolutely preposterous.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not here to defend Donald Trump, but I do feel the need to explain to people that the Russia story is 100% fabricated bullshit. Trump is complicit in the Russia story. He <em>wants</em> to look guilty to distract everyone from the fact that he&#39;s sailing us right into the biggest war in history. No one seems to realize this cause they&#39;re all tuned to Mother Russia, but our military movements lately seem to suggest that we&#39;re about to fuck the whole goddamn world up, fast.</p>

<p>I can agree. I was out in my yard pulling weeds, and I saw 2 F16s flying lower than I ever seen, performing practice drills around my neighborhood. They were only several hundred feet up, and were circling around the area for a good 20 minutes or so. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That Storm Clouds Gathering video is an embarrassment. I usually like the guy. But he repeated about 6 DNC propaganda talking-points that have been definitively debunked, and he served them up uncritically for his viewers. It really made me lose respect for him.</p>

<p>I cringed when he repeated the DNC &quot;Katie Johnson&quot; narrative that the Clinton camp manufactured to create a smokescreen to hide Bill Clinton&#39;s decades-long rape accusations. It was the most definitively-debunked story I&#39;ve ever seen and Storm Clouds Gathering included it in his list of &quot;Trump accusations&quot; hoping his audience wouldn&#39;t fact-check it.</p>

<p>That video of his scores an F.</p>

<p>(I always thought he was better than promoting John Podesta propaganda.)</p>

<p>Hell, maybe they got to him. Offered him money to promote that garbage to the Alternative Media crowd.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It isn&#39;t Hillary they&#39;re protecting, it themselves.  The Clintons have amassed a huge fortune and wield an ungodly amount of power and influence - entire countries have been laid to waste and the coffers looted because they made it so.  They&#39;ve been untouchable for decades, or at least appeared to be, so everyone got in on the action.  If the Clintons go down the a large portion of the US government could very well go down with them.  No one on the Clinton money-train wants it to end, or have their careers ruined by their involvement in it or (God forbid) actually answer for their crimes. </p>

Y&#39;all turned me on to Anthony Brian Logan and Roaming Millennial too. Should get more guests! But I know you&#39;re trying with DP and that wacko Bigfoot guy, Caine?. Keep trying. Anyway man I hope you, The Clowny One and The Young Jizzer keep it up, keep expanding like with the Saturday show.

    <div class="md"><p>The funniest thing I noticed was the insistence on bringing Russia into the Seth Rich issue, either by claiming &quot;it&#39;s a distraction&quot; or, &quot;Russians killed Rich.&quot; I wondered why and remarked that two conspiracy theories can exist side-by-side.</p>

<p>But in this case, they can&#39;t. The entire Russia theory hinges on Seth Rich <em>not</em> being the Wikileaker... because then, the &quot;Russia hacked the election&quot; falls apart. Not to mention, you open the can of worms because now there&#39;s a murder investigation (or at least, there should be).  </p>

<p>The establishment has to stifle the Rich thing with the exact intensity as they&#39;re promoting the Russia line, because the storylines are dependent on the other in some way.</p>

<p>I actually don&#39;t know why I didn&#39;t piece this together earlier. I feel kinda stupid for ever doubting Rich was killed by anyone other than camp DNC/Clinton.</p>
