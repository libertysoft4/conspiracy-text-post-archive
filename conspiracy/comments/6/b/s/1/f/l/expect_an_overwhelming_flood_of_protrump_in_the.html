<p>As I said elsewhere, people here said the same thing about the WaPo article the other day. Turns out it was right. </p>

<p>Do they have a bias (like one could say of any media)? Sure. But that doesn&#39;t mean every word is lie. Do they lie on the weather too?</p>

<p>Spencer and others have said that he created the term &quot;alt-right&quot;, which he considers a movement about white identity. Breitbart News described Spencer&#39;s website AlternativeRight.com as &quot;a center of alt-right thought.&quot;</p>
