    <div class="md"><p>President Trump, facing a growing nuclear threat from North Korea, warned the country on Tuesday against any new provocations and issued his own threat of &quot;fire and fury like the world has never seen.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;North Korea best not make any more threats to the United States,” Trump told reporters from the clubhouse of his golf course in Bedminster, N.J., where he was being briefed separately on the opioid epidemic. “They will be met with fire and the fury like the world has never seen.” </p>

<p>Trump added that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un “has been very threatening beyond a normal state, and as I said, they will be met with fire, fury and frankly power, the likes of which this world has never seen before.”</p>

<p>The comments came after a report in the Washington Post on Tuesday citing a U.S. intelligence assessment that North Korea has successfully produced a miniaturized nuclear warhead that can be affixed to missiles, greatly expanding the country’s range and power.</p>

<p>An empty fucking airbase.</p>

<p>Concerning North Korea, I sincerely hope he limits military action to a preventive strategy.  But judging on past presidential reelection war efforts, I hope he&#39;s not saving this one in his back pocket for 2020.</p>

<p>He bombed an empty airbase (when a country is at war, you don&#39;t have empty airbases.  They likely have a warning...) and even then, bombed a landing strip.  It was repaired in days.</p>

<p>I agree. Just like Obama was responsible for HIS actions. Plenty of folks argue that Obama was &quot;pressured&quot; into drone strikes and certain moves in the Middle East...I don&#39;t give a shit. The buck stops with him. Same with Trump.</p>

<p>FYI I&#39;m not downvoting you, and again, I agree. </p>

<p>But if we&#39;re going to dig into bombings that result in civilian casualties. Do you know how many innocent civilian have died in Syria and Iraq since Trump took office? Over a 1,000. Those deaths come from strikes that, again, the President has authorized. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>MOABs weren&#39;t dropped on that airbase, matter of fact, no MOABs were dropped in Syria at all.  I guess you&#39;re confusing it with the 1 MOAB that dropped in Afghanistan. </p>

<p>Also, Trump had nothing to do with the MOAB mission. They didn&#39;t even tell Trump about the mission, which was in planning for months before they dropped it. The head General in Afghanistan has had approval to drop whatever he felt was needed for over a year. He asked for the MOAB months before Obama left office and it just took a while for the bomb to get delivered to Afghanistan.</p>

<p>After giving up friends, social standing and even family, the ego cannot handle admitting it&#39;s wrong. Trump has, and continues to, make complete laughing stocks out of these poor fools.

I think the only thing wrong on that is the estimated 14.5 tril in debt by 2018, we&#39;re much closer to 20tril... These will be the true test of an economic nationalist president like Trump. In the next 2 years you&#39;ll see most of these graphs turn around - foods stamps, home ownership, median family income. FED Debt accumulation will slow, (actually down 100bil+ since trump took office) aside from healthcare costs and fed debt. those graphs will turn. Time will show. As far as directly attributed to Trump? Consumer confidence, job creation, &quot;Bull run&quot; on the stock markets. Here is job growth expectation vs reality since Trump took office.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump made a lot of promises in the run up to the election that I can think of off the top of my head.</p>

<p>He encouraged &quot;LOCK HER UP!&quot; chants. Hillary&#39;s still free.  Trump could initiate an indictment against her at any time, seeing as how he&#39;s the Attorney General&#39;s boss. He hasn&#39;t.    </p>

<p>He said he&#39;d repeal the ACA &quot;on day one.&quot;  It&#39;s been 8 months, it&#39;s still around, and Trump said he had no idea health care &quot;could be so complicated.&quot;  </p>

<p>He said he had a plan to defeat ISIS &quot;in 30 days.&quot;  Again, 8 months later, they&#39;re still around.  </p>

<p>The &quot;big, beautiful wall&quot; is now going to be see-through and only cover a portion of American&#39;s southern border. If it even gets built at all.  That&#39;s not making America great again.  </p>

<p>The Muslim ban?  It keeps getting struck down in the courts for being unConstitutional, and they even rolled back the ban on bringing an iPad on the flight from Middle Eastern countries.  Lame!  Weak!  </p>

<p>Oh my god, there&#39;s just so much winning!  Meanwhile, Trump&#39;s coasting on the economy created since the crash nine years ago. Remember when everyone questioned those numbers?  Yeah, I do. They&#39;re from the same institutions that everyone claimed were &quot;fake&quot; when Obama was president.  Suddenly, the same numbers are magical indicators of Trump&#39;s economic prowess.  You&#39;re not fooling us.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes Trump says a lot of crazy things - art of the deal. Hillarys time will come. He immediately rescinded the penalty for not purchasing Obamacare and has been pushing for repeal since taking office. ISIS has lost several top leaders and has been very rapidly conceding ground to allied forces. Please take a look at Mad Dogs strategy and the current situation. Surround then annihilate. It was never a MUSLIM ban you ignorant fuck, it was a travel ban targeted at 7 specific countries where there were documented terrorist occupation and activities. Trump has been shattering expectations for job growth and GDP. Paving the way for a massive infrastructure spending bill and breathing life into the manufacturing backbone across the country.

had previously been a Trump supporter. She posted <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/6o7ets/as_a_black_woman_i_wanna_say_fuck/">THIS</a> to T_D 3 weeks ago, which I tagged and marked with her username. Then attempted to delete.</p>

<p>She was offered a free (online, I imagine) beer for the post by a user in that post:</p>

<p>This is interesting, at least to me. I have most of T_D posters tagged, around 25k of them. And I am seeing more and more posts like these, people I have tagged because of their strong Trump Support. But who now are, seemingly, pretending it was never them at all.</p>

<p>You want a conspiracy? I should share my tagged list. It would stun you to see how many are jumping off the bandwagon these days.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One possibility is black propaganda. A user can pretend to be on one side, but post a very shitty submission that is easily debunked or makes that side look bad. They may then have forgotten they used that account for the Trump &quot;support,&quot; and later post anti-Trump material. I&#39;m not accusing OP of anything because I have not perused their history, but this is a possibility to keep in mind in general. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This reverse psychology shit is how they got Trump elected. For example the whole pussy grabbing thing made him <em>more</em> popular, not less (most people aren&#39;t stupid enough to be outraged at something like this, they get mad at the fake outrage). Somehow we&#39;re supposed to think political strategists can&#39;t poll, and couldn&#39;t have predicted this?</p>

<p>Also remember the whole July 4 &quot;antisemitic poster&quot; controversy? Nobody in his right mind could think Trump is judeoskeptical; yet Americans were bombarded by the media with the poster (under the guise &quot;look how horrendous it is&quot;) which read &quot;Clinton Most Corrupt Candidate Ever&quot; on the very same holiday week-end as Comey saying, in substance, &quot;She&#39;s a criminal but she&#39;s above the law&quot;.</p>

<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5nqik3/we_are_witnessing_the_birth_of_seconddegree/">I wrote about it at the time</a> but that wasn&#39;t a popular opinion.</p>

<p>Note I&#39;m not defending the sociopath child abuser and war criminal Clinton. Just saying she played the role of the scarecrow. For every super-hero you need a super-villain.</p>

<p>Do not represent the majority of us</p>

<p>Its not organic its jighly curated by the mod team</p>

<p>Any criticizm of trump or even of anyone mildly related to trump is banned and only circlejerking is allowed</p>

<p>As an example: many people hated sessions for a long time but when trump criticized him we were finally allowed to speak.</p>

<p>Quickly after he decided to keep him on criticizing sessions bacame banned again</p>

<p>Many people dont want war (although fire and fury doesnt necessarily refer to nukes)</p>

<p>Natural cyclical changes in the climate aren&#39;t magic, they are a result of measurable, physical factors and those factors are simply not sufficient to explain the sudden and sustained increase in global temperatures observed in the last two hundred years. You know what does explain that increase? The massive amount of CO2 being released into the atmosphere by human activities beginning with the industrial revolution. <a href="http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/1520-0477%281999%29080&amp;lt;2631%3ADAAORC%3E2.0.CO%3B2">Even studies in 1999</a> and further back, relying on what now would be considered fairly primitive models, demonstrate the lack of a solid scientific basis for the notion that global temperature changes are attributable to natural causes. Yet you continue to parrot that belief. </p>

<p>Here are <a href="http://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/mindex.shtml">several, more recent scientific studies</a> regarding <a href="https://pubs.giss.nasa.gov/abs/ro06900t.html">the impact of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions on the climate</a> and why the <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/339/6124/1198">&quot;it&#39;s a natural cycle&quot; argument is utterly unsupported by the science.</a> Read them and educate yourself.</p>

<p>No. It isn&#39;t if it was it wouldn&#39;t be &quot;for the most part&quot;. By your own admission climate change is a belief. For it to be fact it would have to be &quot;for the whole part&quot;.  </p>

<p>Other people arent in on the joke whenever you do something &quot;ironically&quot;. Worse yet, some of those people will start mimicing the same behaviour, without ever realizing it was a joke to begin with. Kekistan amd meme magic and talk of God Emperors may have started as jokes, but even if no one actually believes it&#39;s true in the literal sense people are sympathetic to the ideas behind the sentiment. Fact of the matter is there are a lot of people now who subconciously believe that Trump can do no wrong, and whatever your stance on politics it&#39;s not good to think that anyone is without faults.</p>

<p>What do we all think was going to happen when we spent years making fun of the NK&#39;s leader?  We made Saturday Night Live jokes and segments.  We applauded a movie about how stupid the guy is and constantly say how bad he is etc.  Do you think that someone isn&#39;t going to come out fighting when they are attacked?  The American population has ridiculed this reign the same as a bully picks on students within schools.  Own up to you and everyone being the problem and stop placing the blame on one guy.</p>

<p>Also many people must not realized that Guam is the home of Anderson Airforce base.  Remember all those times we all heard about how important a place called Andersons Airforce base was but many of us assumed it was located in the US?  Surprise. its Guam.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course threatening nuclear war is not a sane response for any reason.  But with someone who is humiliated constantly expect that someone to come out fighting and responding in extreme forms.  As long as people keep making fun of someone there will be little chance for negotiation that can improve the situation.  One cant expect appositive forward result without offering some form of respect.</p>

<p>My point is that one man (Trump) is not completely responsible for this NK BS.  We the majority of people within the US has spent years making fun of NK&#39;s leader&#39;s character and we all need to learn to back down.  This man is at the point that he is willing to use a nuclear bomb just to be taken seriously.  Its wise that we change how we talk about him and keep our negative opinions to ourselves  This must be defused..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep. I am not a Trump supporter, but sometimes have synergies with them. I posted in there, a post that could be interpreted &quot;Fuck Trump&quot; but actually was &quot;Fuck Them (meaning the political establishment)&quot; and was instantly banned.  I messaged the mods a couple of times, explained my position, and offered to edit the comment. I got back a reluctant &quot;Okay, but don&#39;t do it again&quot; and they rescinded my ban.</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t see that part of the messages, it looks like everyone is rah-rah-rah. What is actually happening is everyone who posts rah-rah-rah is allowed. Anyone who goes against message is banned instantly.</p>

<p>Do not represent the majority of us</p>

<p>Its not organic its jighly curated by the mod team</p>

<p>Any criticizm of trump or even of anyone mildly related to trump is banned and only circlejerking is allowed</p>

<p>As an example: many people hated sessions for a long time but when trump criticized him we were finally allowed to speak.</p>

<p>Quickly after he decided to keep him on criticizing sessions bacame banned again</p>

<p>Many people dont want war (although fire and fury doesnt necessarily refer to nukes)</p>

<p>But  mods only allow duck posts</p>

<p>Edit: as another reply. Youll find suspicious stuff everywhere</p>

<p>If u go to r/esist and tag there top commentors youll find 5 accounts all talking to each other. And eventually getting shafowbanned. Then replaced with 5 new accounts</p>

<p>Ps. If u look at it. Trump really needs to get rid of sessions kelly mcmasters etc if he wants to get advice that will actually help the american ppl</p>

<p>Hes being duped by the neocons and democrats into abandoning his promise.</p>

<p>And the fake news and td is making it impossible for him to see ehat his supporters really want</p>

<blockquote>
<p>a relatively small group of people having religious beliefs or practices regarded by others as strange or sinister.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Even if T_D sincerely worshiped the God Emperor, &quot;strange or sinister&quot; are subjective terms...but their echo chamber has created many strange memes. Giving them the benefit of the doubt, they get pretty intense at times, to say the least.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>a misplaced or excessive admiration for a particular person or thing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>100% this. If there was two things that defined T_D, it would be 1.) Cult of Personality (and not the song), and 2.) White Nationalism. I mean, they have taken &quot;Cult of Personality&quot; to extreme, bizarre lengths, and there is nothing rational about them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a difference between being the aggressor in Syria vs. being the defender in the Pacific. NK&#39;s missiles have diverted civilian airliner traffic.</p>

<p>Trump&#39;s phraseology was not helpful, however. He should have either entered into missile test treaty negotiations with NK or taken the Reagan approach of unilaterally drawing a line in the ocean. As it is now, Trump matched Kim Jong-un&#39;s grade school name calling, and Kim Jong-un upped the ante with a specific and credible threat to launch near Guam. Trump lost that round.</p>

<p>TL;DR: Defending against NK good. Trump&#39;s approach fail.</p>

<p>Do you feel the need to speak up for him, because your personal views are being constantly challenged everytime you bring him, or the sub up? </p>

<p>Do you have access to the whitehouse and these briefings to make the claims you are making about &quot;do you actually think&quot;. If you have to ask that question, don&#39;t YOU think it is because you cannot believe their are other people with views different to yours. It certainly would go a long way to explaining why you launched into a tirade at me for being a &#39;liberal&#39;, when I&#39;m the furthest thing from it?  </p>

<p>If you&#39;re constantly challenged and questioned outside of your space in the T_D, maybe, just maybe, the community you&#39;re part of is an echo chamber, the same way as a repub/dem/labour/toryXdup/snp based sub would be? </p>

<p>If you don&#39;t say the right things, they ban you. Yeah, the mods are in on it. Even if you&#39;re supporting your stance with the words of Trump himself, expect to get banned if you go against their narrative. They likely also have some degree of astroturf pushing the pro-war message too, but the pro-Trump astroturf is basically impossible for me to distinguish from legitimate supporters due to the tone they employ. On the flipside, it&#39;s usually pretty easy to tell when someone who is pro-Democrat are clearly bad actors because they can&#39;t hide behind &quot;meme magic&quot; or whatever. </p>

<p>You must not have dissented in the &quot;right&quot; way or maybe you&#39;ve just slipped under the radar for now. I was super active during the primaries, but although I was only able to slip under the radar for a few months, they got me eventually shortly before the primaries ended (and the shill mods shut down the sub altogether). For me, they accused me of &quot;fearmongering&quot; because I talked about the fraud that was being committed against the Sanders campaign and backed up my claims with links to credible news outlets. I also made it clear that Clinton was wholly unacceptable to me and that I&#39;d be voting Green in the general if I couldn&#39;t vote for Bernie, so that might have done it too. A ton of people at r/wayofthebern have also been banned under similar circumstances, so I know it&#39;s not just me. </p>

<p>&quot;The two sides are not the same&quot;, true, but that doesn&#39;t mean that both don&#39;t employ bans to censor dissenters. Also, although Trump supporters are frequently hate-filled and although Trump himself supports hateful policies, r/the_donald is not a &quot;hate sub&quot;. The only things they hate on there are corruption, criminality, and Democrats. The users might be bigots and Trump himself is one without a doubt, but that sub is careful to not allow it. Obviously for public relations reasons, but even so, it&#39;s not a &quot;hate sub&quot;. </p>

<p>Don;t be disruptive and you won;t get banned.

That&#39;s very different from unprovoked wars in the middle east and naturaly Trump and America will demonstrate to Kim that if he starts shit he will be the one that ends in a ball of fire.
That is actualy healthy, because if Kim gets that fact through his head he would &#39;bend the knee&#39; and scrap his nuclear missile program. He has become used to years of toothless politicians and become emboldened.
The best way to prevent a war is to make Kim understand or at least believe the U.S is now perfectly willing and even eager to hammer him.</p>

<p>What they fail to see is the two party system in America is a way for the Elite to control the masses.  Literally the same thing- An illusion of choice.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t care about Dems vs Republicans, because it&#39;s about as important as who will win the next Super Bowl.  Wake up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People like a show of power and to feel like their country is in charge. &quot;Fire and fury&quot; doesn&#39;t have to mean nuclear at all. It looks like war was coming no matter who was elected. It seems this was all planned 10 years ago. It is being pushed now by Congress, not Trump. I think a veto-proof sanctions bill that nearly doubles as a declaration of war would be just as veto-proof for Hillary.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump is going to look bad if:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>NK actually lands a nuke on NATO forces</p></li>
<li><p>Trump nukes NK before they launch an overt attack</p></li>
<li><p>Trump orders a more surgical strike, and likely sparks all sorts of power-plays.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>If scenario 1 happens, then 2 or 3 happen too. If scenario 2 or 3 happens, he likely sparks an even greater refugee crisis.</p>

<p>I think the fair thing to do, is divorce yourself from your knowledge of Trump as president, and consider the dilemma objectively. What the fuck would you do in his position? As someone entrusted with the lives of his people, I&#39;d probably have nuked NK already.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If North Korea attacks Guam with a Nuclear Warhead would you not want us to respond.  I consider myself a  liberal and I did not vote for Trump, but also recognize thsa he rest of the world doesn’t play by our idealistic rules and maybe you need to step outside of your bubble.   Sometimes you have to just swing and ask if your me wrong well at least you’re still alive.  Keep in mind that N Korea has been threatening to attack us and here leader is literally insane and forces everyone to treat him like a god.  if they aren’t willing to overthrow their own psycho leader they must not have too much of an issue.  They are a problem, and you can’t just ignore the situation. </p>

<p>You&#39;re either ignorant of the situation or are purposefully misrepresenting what happened.</p>

<p>Trump was pressured to act because of &quot;alleged&quot; Darin gas attacks in the Ghouta of Damascus Syria (The exact same situation happening just 3 years earlier.... both times happening when the FSA was gaining ground on SDF and ISIS.  Suspicious, no?)</p>

<p>SO Trump drops those famous MOABs on northern Syria as a warning to Assad.  Great.  But do you know what he struck?</p>

<p>An empty fucking airbase.</p>

<p>And not even the airbase, he struck the runway.</p>

<p>Concerning North Korea, I sincerely hope he limits military action to a preventive strategy.  But judging on past presidential reelection war efforts, I hope he&#39;s not saving this one in his back pocket for 2020.</p>
