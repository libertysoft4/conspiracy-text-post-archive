    <div class="md"><p>Unfortunately, the moderators would need the help of the admins to identify and slow legitimate shilling operations. As far as I know, the admins have no interest in helping with this issue.  </p>

<p>Really though, this person is not calling for censorship of opposing opinions and theories. It only appears that way because we can&#39;t really tell the difference between the shills and the idiots who parrot their talking points and strategies. If we could really block organizations like ShareBlue from operating here, then <em>all</em> opposing views would be welcome here and would be discussed thoughtfully and respectfully, comparatively speaking, as it was 2+ years ago.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You cannot depend on others for clarity and rationale.  At this point it&#39;s impossibpe to dispute that the vast majority of people in the world are carefully herded morons who lack any ability to be critical of themselves and depend heavily upon an outside authority to give them the resources and answers they need in order to function.  The Internet and reddit are merely places where these symptoms are expressed and displayed.</p>

<p>There are people here who thinks jews are responsible for all the suffering in the world, others who blame lizard people, some who blame liberals and others who blame conservatives, and there are many more who don&#39;t believe any of this but have a vested interest in keeping hard working common people divided, because only by abusing and subjugating us are they able to maintain a life of opulence and ease.  </p>

<p>Their avarice is only possible through the suffering and sacrifice of the multitudes, and it is easy for them to justify it all as &quot;simply business&quot; but the truth is that each of us makes choices and the sum of those choices tells a story of who we truly are.  So make the choice to embody critical thinking, passionless observation of facts, and passionate dedication to whatever good you can find a way to believe in because only through kind and compassionate acts is goodness and justice made to manifest in this world and only through their absence can abuse, injustice, subjugation and suffering thrive.</p>

<p>The reality is that we are surrounded on all sides by people who wish desperately to sway our opinions and convince us to give over our lives to their causes.  Do not succumb.  Think for yourself and reserve your judgments until you can be sure.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have several of the top submissions of all time in this subreddit under a couple of different accounts (no, I&#39;m not ban evading - I&#39;ve never been banned from this sub) and I can confirm that things have become completely fucked since the last election. Never before has this subreddit been filled with so many sycophants willing to let the government get away with such overt corruption, incompetence and greed.</p>

<p>For the previous 8 years, (after it became clear that &quot;change&quot; was a lie) Obama and his government was relentlessly criticised and rarely defended. Now, there&#39;s an <em>immense</em> wave of people going to massive lengths to protect the POTUS and his government from criticism.</p>

<p>The difference is that while Obama supporters quickly realised he wasn&#39;t any different to the previous puppets, there are government supporters now who would take a bullet to prevent their dear leader from being criticised.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>DNC pushed narratives</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It really is insane how much DNC bullshit is posted to this sub, despite their complete political irrelevance. Republicans control all three branches of government, and Clinton and Podesta are fucking irrelevant to <em>everyone</em> in politics, but Trump supporters want to keep distracting from his corruption by trying to make the conversation about this group of irrelevant nobodies.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>People defending MSM</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This was always a thing to some degree, but it&#39;s really reached a new level now that Trump is labelling <em>everything except Fox News</em> fake. You can really see the division between sceptical people looking through multiple sources for facts, and the people who push Fox News rhetoric while pretending to be against MSM.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>People defending US intel agencies</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But that&#39;s not what&#39;s been happening. Republicans have destroyed the political system so effectively that even anti-intel people can now only hope that the checks and balances of the constitution are able prevent a dictator from seizing complete and permanent control.</p>

<p>Intel agencies aren&#39;t being defended in a general sense. No one&#39;s &quot;supporting&quot; the CIA or FBI now that wasn&#39;t already. The thing that&#39;s being defended is the investigation pursuing a fascist megalomaniac who has been installed into the highest office of government.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Paid shilling</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The only thing that&#39;s changed in this regard is that pro-government Trump supporters are screaming &quot;SHILL&quot; and &quot;BOT&quot; <em>every single time</em> someone disagrees with them. I mean, none of the people screaming &quot;shills&quot; at the moment are mentioning the bought influence of the Koch brothers, Cambridge Analytica or News Corp.</p>

<p>How do you identify paid shilling?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Seriously, what the hell happened to this place? Why are the mods allowing this? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Evidently (as some bigger discussions in the sub today indicate) many people here are willing to let pro-government posters rampage through here spreading whatever nonsense and abuse they like, while contriving ways to prevent discussion of corruption in the whitehouse or the government, such as implementing &quot;contest mode&quot; and banning posters who question or criticise the pro-government narrative.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The MSM and deep state collaborating with Democrats and republican has been exposed.  The Russian narrative has been spread far and wide by fake news.  The Awan spy ring / Clinton Foundation /  Brownstone ops have been outed.  A lot of this revolves around the DNC - They rigged the elections taking out Sanders... In the past the deep state might have leaned more Republican under Bushes but the MSM are clearly on the side of  mostly Democrats and with the exception of establishment Republicans now.</p>

<p>Many of the conspiracies this sub has focused on such as flat earth and aliens is probably Psy ops..  The deep state is on the ropes and the DNC is the festering wound that we can see.

<p>This is a bit of a strawman. The NWO conspiracies are not predicated on the existence of an all-powerful or magical group controlling the world. Obviously such a thing does not and cannot exist. Everything in this world has finite power. Everyone and every group makes mistakes sometimes. We could have a very powerful group attacking our government, but they will never be all-powerful and then can always be beaten.  </p>

<p>I know that was not the main point you were trying to make, so please just move on if you are not interested in this thread of discussion. I just think it&#39;s an important distinction to make.</p>

<p>Yeah, so it&#39;s pretty obvious that the most hated POTUS ever wouldn&#39;t organically have accumulated so many die-hard fanatics willing to defend his every corrupt abuse and lie.</p>

<p>I&#39;m pretty convinced at this point that pretty much every account constantly spamming about CTR and ShareBlue shilling are themselves bots or shills, deliberately trying to conflate the situation to make it more difficult to call out the pro-government bots/shills.</p>

<p>WTF does this even mean? The DNC have no power over the CIA or the FBI. The DNC doesn&#39;t control any branch of government. It was overwhelmingly Republican congressmen who voted for the PATRIOT Act, endless war, creating TSA molestation stations, concealing records about war crimes/JFK etc.</p>

<p>The Republican party - currently led by Trump - are the ones predominately responsible for the refugees, the dead servicemen, the &quot;free speech zones&quot; and the other losses of liberties that led us to this point. What the fuck is Trump doing about any of that? Even his claims of &quot;draining the swamp&quot; were obviously lies when he was always intending to install billionaire bankers and Goldman Sachs thieves to the top levels of government.</p>

<p>The festering wound that&#39;s always been exposed is the GOP who have consistently voted to take away liberties and freedoms, launching wars and terror attacks, while filling their own bank accounts.</p>

<p>Trump isn&#39;t going after anyone who has actually contributed to fucking America up - even/especially his long time friends the Clintons.</p>

As someone who has watched this community evolve for more than eight years (I lurked here before creating this account), let me offer my genuine and heartfelt opinion: it is people like <a href="/u/influentia">/u/influentia</a> that are the big problem here. The comment I am replying to is a perfect example of what you were complaining about.  </p>

<p>One thing in particular stands out like a sore thumb:  </p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>DNC pushed narratives<br/>
It really is insane how much DNC bullshit is posted to this sub, despite their complete political irrelevance. Republicans control all three branches of government, and Clinton and Podesta are fucking irrelevant to everyone in politics, but Trump supporters want to keep distracting from his corruption by trying to make the conversation about this group of irrelevant nobodies.  </p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>This is glaring example of somebody being disingenuous, i.e. posting in bad faith. Let&#39;s not kid ourselves, it&#39;s clear enough that you were referring to narratives being pushed <em>by</em> the DNC rather than narratives being pushed <em>about</em> the DNC. We have seen this tactic used much more frequently here since Trump was inaugurated. The strategy is to feign ignorance and reply as if the person meant something else entirely just because there was some technical ambiguity in the wording, even if everybody knows what they meant. This creates a whole separate line of discussion that distracts from the point that the original poster was trying to make.   </p>

<p>The next paragraph is pretty bad too. He pretends not to realize that you are referring to clear-cut MSM propaganda rags like WaPo and CNN as much as or perhaps even more so than Fox. This community has been pretty much unanimous in rejecting these sources. I agree that Fox has gotten a little more attention here lately. However, if people discuss something from Fox news here, part of the interest is because people wonder why they appear to be going in such a different direction than CNN, for example. This doesn&#39;t mean we trust them. They are making themselves interesting to conspiracy theorists by permitting discussion of the Deep State problem, which has been a central topic on every conspiracy forum since the internet was born. Naturally people are going to discuss them here. That&#39;s not the same thing as trusting. On the other hand, I have seen people here outright defending WaPo and CNN as being legitimate journalistic organizations rather than the Project Mockingbird propaganda rags that they are. I have <em>never</em> seen something like that happen on this subreddit in all the time I&#39;ve been here until Trump was inaugurated and ShareBlue swung into full gear. Before the election, any narrative pushed by WaPo or CNN was immediately seen as suspect by the entire community. Now we feature them on the front page of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> on a regular basis, particularly when they are pushing the narrative that this Russian collusion story is legitimate rather than a political attack.  </p>

<p>Overall, my opinion is that the subreddit is worse now than it has ever been because Media Matters targeted us for subversion via ShareBlue. We hear people bitching about <a href="/r/The_Donald">/r/The_Donald</a> users about 100 times for every one comment or post that genuinely belongs <em>over there</em> rather than here. We even ban people for acting like they are on <a href="/r/The_Donald">/r/The_Donald</a>. The concern trolling is totally disingenuous. People are trying to bully us into a corner where if we are filthy alt-right scum if we even so much as maintain a neutral stance toward President Trump, or if we withhold judgment, or if we dare to entertain the thought that (<em>gasp</em>) he is trying to do right by exposing and prosecuting those involved in the Deep State conspiracy.  </p>

<p>There have always been a political thread here because of the big political conspiracy to take over the world that we have been witnessing for decades. We have always hated both parties. That&#39;s why it was so satisfying for many people to watch Trump destroy so many establishment Republicans in the primary and then go on to defeat the establishment surrogate Hillary Clinton. It&#39;s no surprise that we got an influx of people who are somewhat optimistic about President Trump. The part that feels unnatural is when I&#39;m being preached to by a newcomer about the dangers of the two-party system and the left/right paradigm who then turns around to offer a WaPo or CNN source as if it should be taken at face value. This is psychological warfare. In my opinion, ShareBlue is the number one attacker here. That&#39;s not to say that no other groups are attempting to manipulate this subreddit, but my gut instinct says that only ShareBlue cares enough right now to make a significant impact.</p>

<p><em>sigh</em></p>

<p>This has been said a million times and everyone that&#39;s actually familiar with this subreddit knows that not everyone is comfortable using a single reddit account for a decade, with the information and data that exposes.</p>

<p>Yeah, and I think it&#39;s also pretty clear that I was responding like that because of how obvious it is that the pro-government crowd is being wilfully ignorant or deliberately deceptive by pretending that the DNC is still politically relevant right now, entirely in order to distract from the conspiracies involving the GOP and Trump.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>If you thought I was &#39;feigning ignorance&#39; when responding to &quot;OMG DNC CLINTON PODESTA OMG&quot; with a pertinent explanation of how that&#39;s being used to conceal GOP/Trump crimes then you&#39;re mistaken and/or projecting, because the response explained itself.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The next paragraph is pretty bad too. He pretends not to realize that you are referring to clear-cut MSM propaganda rags like WaPo and CNN as much as or perhaps even more so than Fox. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is one of the main problems with the pro-government crowd. Fox News has deliberately fed propaganda, lies and fearmongering into so many minds that it&#39;s hard to find a reasonable ground to have a discussion about real propaganda on.</p>

<p>The Murdoch empire has been spreading <em>actual</em> propaganda in aid of the GOP for decades. They went to the Supreme Court to defend the right to <em>deliberately lie under the guise of news</em>.</p>

<p>I think the other outlets are warmongering mouthpieces for the 1%, but they have absolutely fucking nothing on News Corp and the literal propaganda and brainwashing that&#39;s fed into the world to make people subservient and stupid enough to support a corrupt billionaire demagogue like Trump.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They are making themselves interesting to conspiracy theorists by permitting discussion of the Deep State problem</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Such utter bullshit. Fox News shows you exactly what the Deep State wants you to see. They are literally the propaganda of the deep state. The fact that the deep state has convinced you to fight so hard for their mouthpiece is evidence of how effective Murdoch&#39;s propaganda has been.</p>

<p>Fox is the media outlet that fought for the right to lie to the public; the media outlet that supports the GOP no matter what; the media outlet that is the first to call for war and stripping liberties in the name of fake security.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Before the election, any narrative pushed by WaPo or CNN was immediately seen as suspect by the entire community.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>People still treat it sceptically, but when you&#39;re considering everything through a brain washed by Fox News, it makes sense that you think less brainwashed people are &#39;supportive&#39; of the things you have been trained to hate without consideration.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Overall, my opinion is that the subreddit is worse now than it has ever been because Media Matters targeted us for subversion via ShareBlue.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So fucking ridiculous. This subreddit used to be anti-establishment until it was taken over by Trump&#39;s shitsucking sycophants, and now it&#39;s a circlejerk about the politically irrelevant DNC.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>But that&#39;s not what&#39;s happening. There are <em>constant</em> posts and comments flooding this subreddit in defense of the POTUS, something that was unthinkable for the last 8 years. Not to mention the constant <em>distractions</em> of Podesta and DNC bullshit used to keep people from looking into the government&#39;s corruption.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>There is no evidence for this despite Trumpets constantly repeating it in order to make it seem like their opinions aren&#39;t completely aberrant, especially on this sub.</p>

<p>I would say mods should start banning everyone who mentions ShareBlue and CTR or calling people shills and bots because it&#39;s so fucking pathetic and overdone, and it is the most egregious example of a rule 10 violation... unfortunately (and conveniently for you) the mods here are completely on your side and seem happy to help you silence discussion about <em>actual</em> conspiracies so you can circlejerk about the DNC.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Been here about 8 years, came from digg...It&#39;s definitely different. There are more real users than ever and more fake users than ever. Lots of stupid partisan discussion and i can&#39;t tell if that is coming from fake users just new users who haven&#39;t realized both parties suck. Its still exciting to see how many people come to conspiracy now, and regardless of how legitimate i feel Alex Jones is, it&#39;s pretty exciting how much influence he had and conspiracy had in general. As shallow as discussion can get with partisan newbies i am glad everyone is here. The more they&#39;re expressed to true thought the better for humanity. Peoples time to learn. I&#39;m tired of hearing about Russia, I&#39;m tired of people saying democrats are better, and I&#39;m also tired off peeps acting like trump has done anything spectacular. He might&#39;ve trying to do something good, just looking at the media frenzy against him...but he hasn&#39;t done anything good yetside from back out of the TPP</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The MSM and deep state collaborating with Democrats and republican has been exposed.  The Russian narrative has been spread far and wide by fake news.  The Awan spy ring / Clinton Foundation /  Brownstone ops have been outed.  A lot of this revolves around the DNC - They rigged the elections taking out Sanders... In the past the deep state might have leaned more Republican under Bushes but the MSM are clearly on the side of  mostly Democrats and with the exception of establishment Republicans now.</p>

<p>Many of the conspiracies this sub has focused on such as flat earth and aliens is probably Psy ops..  The deep state is on the ropes and the DNC is the festering wound that we can see.  Nobody knows if Trump will go after -  I don&#39;t agree with the rhetoric and policies so much but the Deep State is fucking scared of him.. So I am giving him a chance..  We know which side the Shills are being paid on..  </p>
