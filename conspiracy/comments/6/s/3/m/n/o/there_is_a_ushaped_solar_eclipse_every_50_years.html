<p>Wasn&#39;t able to wrap my head around the physics. If Earth is spinning one direction 24 hours and the moon takes a month to orbit the Earth, it doesn&#39;t seem like this pattern should be possible.</p>

<p>As it gets close to the eclipse point the only factor of the pattern or direction of the eclipse should be the Earth&#39;s rotation. Since the moon is in a (relatively) set position as is the sun [it takes a full month to complete a Moon cycle relative to the sun - and the Earth takes a year to orbit the Sun]. </p>

<p><strong>The moon and the sun relative to each other are hardly moving [since its said the Earths rotation is where they derive their apparent motion] ergo - the only thing really effecting the path would be that apparent motion - the rotation of the Earth</strong> </p>

<p>Eclipses do not last long enough in the mental image created for there to be a change in the eclipse path.</p>

<p><a href="http://shedka.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/eclipsemap.jpg">Here&#39;s another one showing a giant half moon in Greenland region</a> - at the distances the Moon and Sun are said to be it is very perplexing how the shapes of the eclipses could even change to this degree. Test this with any object next to a light - to produce such a drastic change seems to require the a shift in distance between the light source and blocking object.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You may have noticed, these eclipses are predicted decades in advance.  If you see the eclipse arrive this year, and it goes according to their prediction, then they&#39;ve &quot;modelled&quot; it pretty damn well, no?  Just because you insist on denying it, doesn&#39;t make it not so.</p>

<p>Your post and comments are full of very wrong assumptions, which make you unable to grasp what&#39;s happening.  But it&#39;s happening.  The earth spins.  It orbits the sun.  The moon orbits the earth.  These orbits have cycles, which makes their paths vary over the seasons and years.  All of these moving parts moving in non uniform rates and directions will make different patterns.</p>

<p>(And nope.  It&#39;s not flat)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Something is wrong there still. Wherever the dot is, there needs to be a syzygy [alignment] of the sun and moon creating it.</p>

<p>That puts the Moon and Sun above the equator - given the distance above the poles presumably.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Still trying to understand what that alignment would be considering the other patterns.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s not the alignment of the sun and moon that causes the patterns.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the fact that the moon&#39;s shadow is landing on and moving across a sphere, coupled with that sphere being tilted on its axis.</p>

<p>You mentioned in another comment projecting a light or shadow onto a wall. Because the wall is flat, the shadow will track in a straight line. But if you projected onto a sphere, although the shadow will still move in a straight line, when it lands on the sphere it&#39;s path will be curved.</p>

<p>Plus, due to earth&#39;s axis being tilted, in northern summer the pole is tilted towards the sun, so a summer eclipse in the north will potentially have a more eccentric path. Similarly in southern summer.</p>

<p>Maps also cause distortions due to them being a 2D representation of a sphere. Different map projections preserve one thing at the expense of causing distortions in another. The Mercator projection for example (which is the one we commonly use), preserves direction but causes size and shape distortions, with those distortions becoming more pronounced the further north and south you are.</p>

<p>So depending on which map projection you use to plot an eclipse path, there are going to be distortions.</p>

<p>What&#39;s that got to do with the &quot;U-shaped&quot; eclipses you are talking about?</p>
