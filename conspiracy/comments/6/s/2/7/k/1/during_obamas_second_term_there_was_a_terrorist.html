<p>You know that in cities most people take public transportation or walk to places - especially they intend on drinking. I live in a city and can name many clubs that will have that number or more on a busy night and they have zero parking spaces. </p>

<p>The truck one is just meaningless. What kind of car should be used if it&#39;s a real attack?</p>

Seneca is also a stoic philosopher much like Aurelius. Also worth reading his work. On the shortness of life I think is the bit that I read and I quite enjoyed it.</p>

<ul>

<li><p>knowing that people could always fuck you over (you&#39;re in this alone)</p></li>
