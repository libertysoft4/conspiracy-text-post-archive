    <div class="md"><p>We are experimenting with possibly putting all current political related posts into contest mode via Automoderator in the near future. The posts that have recently been put into contest mode by mods are somewhat of a trial of this idea.</p>

<p>The details are still being worked out and debated. It might not ever materialize into anything at all.</p>

<p>We are all quite sick of seeing the RNC/DNC spam that gets posted here daily. And the thoughts behind Automod are that the posts going into contest mode will help to deter those who create the threads as an agenda and deter those who post politically biased comments for upvotes.</p>

<p>As I said it is still a work in progress at the moment. Does anyone have any feedback regarding Automod and political posts? Ideas? </p>

<p>(Just trying to be open and honest here)</p>

<p>Regards,</p>

<p>The irony is palpable.</p>

<p>No amount of fancy language and tricky accusations will stop the majority of people from laughing at how incredibly bias and one sided this sub has become.</p>

<p>You&#39;re &quot;curbing&quot; posts that don&#39;t fit the narrative here.. you&#39;re literally helping censor stuff that doesn&#39;t fit the clear cut conservative agenda around here.</p>

<p>And you&#39;re treating the viewers like they&#39;re too fucking stupid to see it.. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nope, there&#39;s real conspiracies going on at the highest levels of government that we should be discussing.</p>

<p>But when one side has circumstantial evidence based on blogs and unsourced ideas.. and the other side has multiple government agencies investigating, a special counsel investigating, the senate and house investigating..</p>

<p>I think we can all use our brains to figure out which was are valid, and should be taken seriously.. and which ones we can ignore.. or put into contest mode.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah, the source junky. You will fit right in over there. All the big names in media are covered extensively. </p>

<p>Here, we discuss theories (not necessarily news), which is probably why you&#39;ve been so hostile to the concept of opinions that don&#39;t match yours.  This may seem pretty off-putting to you, but there are people here who talk about 9/11 being an inside job. As you can imagine there is not much coverage of that theory on CNN, but it&#39;s a very intriguing conspiracy and we discuss that here. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It doesn&#39;t censor things in the sense that it removes them.. It removes the ability for the community, or outsiders even, to know what the rest of the community actually feels. It takes the validity away from any good arguments and allows manipulative or false arguments to look good. </p>

<p>There&#39;s no way to discuss, analyze, share info.. if everything is random and there are no votes.. it&#39;s pointless to even have a conspiracy sub.</p>

<p>When you can manually decide which topics the community can eaisly discuss, and which they can&#39;t.. you&#39;re limiting the ability to freely discuss whatever is relevant... If the mods side one way or the other, they can simply create an environment where it is impossible to effectively share info on one topic, but not another. </p>

<p>Few days that is at least 48 hours if I am being generous then you mention it in a post about something else without your Mod flair.  That kind of does make it look like it is being done in secret.</p>

<p>Sticky a thread and do this all out in the open for multiple days to give everyone else a chance to see it.    </p>

<p>Are you a new mod? Cause this isn&#39;t the first time this has been done and this isn&#39;t the first time this sub came under attack for appearing to bury the Russia story. </p>

<p>They should pin a post so we call all talk about it.  </p>

<p>“But the plans were on display…”
“On display? I eventually had to go down to the cellar to find them.”
“That’s the display department.”
“With a flashlight.”
“Ah, well, the lights had probably gone.”
“So had the stairs.”
“But look, you found the notice, didn’t you?”
“Yes,” said Arthur, “yes I did. It was on display in the bottom of a locked filing cabinet stuck in a disused lavatory with a sign on the door saying ‘Beware of the Leopard.” </p>

<p>Show me entire threads derailed by 100+ upvoted comments that just deride other users and offer shitty hot-take comments and jokes? I don&#39;t see this happening in any other space. </p>

<p>and where are all the pro-Trump comments voted up over 100 votes that you guys keep talking about? I can&#39;t find them. So what are we talking about with &#39;even-handed&#39; action? Any thread about Trump - pro or anti - gets hit hard by both sides. It&#39;s just clear one side is pushing a lot harder than the other. To act ignorant of that betrays your genuineness.</p>

 The amount of <em>actually</em> fake news from Fox, Breitbart, Drudge, Infowars, etc. is astounding.

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s not an explanation. That&#39;s something they might do in the future.</p>

<p>When they first announced contest mode, they said it would be used when certain threads saw strange jumps in traffic and voting out of nowhere - which is usually a sign of vote/bot manipulation. If they have the same amount of page-views between 2 threads and one is seeing 500% more comments and votes than the other, it&#39;s normal to look into that and try to combat manipulation.</p>

<p>All this spazzing out is over what? why is contest mode so offensive to discussion? All it does is slightly inconvenience the user so that they aren&#39;t being fed a steaming pile of bought opinion. For anybody who is truly only interested in having a conversation, this is a non-issue. For anybody who takes an interest in shaping the narrative or trying to convince people of their own (ego-worship), this is hugely offensive. </p>

<p>So which side of things do you sit on? Is the ability to see things &#39;in order&#39; more important than preserving chaos? Or should we just take our pills like the doctor says and let everyone have an equal shot (aka pay to play). It&#39;s not an easy situation.</p>

People can&#39;t even come up with examples where it should have happened.

    <div class="md"><p>we&#39;ll see how the criteria changes or evolves. I know it started as a vote/comment stat &amp; manipulation thing, but maybe they are debating contest for all topics because all the shills are whining like crazy cause they aren&#39;t gonna get more money for their business if we keep doing contest mode.</p>

<p>With that said, if we do contest mode for everything, we end up down a weird, different hallway of censorship which also sucks.</p>

<p>I think the contest mode criteria should be set by behavior in the thread in question. I understand they are testing doing it by different metrics, but I think the way they have been doing it (non-test) is the best way. I haven&#39;t seen too many threads that should have had it enabled, and I haven&#39;t disagreed with any time it&#39;s been used so far.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>From previous mod comments, when they have 2 threads with similar clicks and views but one has multiple times the traffic and extremely high vote totals come in during very small windows, it matches behaviors explained to them as an outside influence or &#39;brigade&#39;.</p>

<p>For myself, this makes perfect sense. It&#39;s only in these hyper-partisan threads do the comments get to such crazy high numbers due to all the sliding and the hot air being huffed at one another. It&#39;s not consistent with the community&#39;s behavior, so why should I assume it is genuine?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here is a better representation of my point:</p>

<p>Cannabis thread you linked above:</p>

<p>8405 upvotes, 485 comments</p>

<p>Manafort thread about subpoenaed emails:</p>

<p>156 upvotes, 148 comments</p>

<p>Do you see the difference in behaviors? One thread has about 5% comments to upvotes. The other almost has the same number of upvotes as comments.</p>

<p>This is behavior that can sometimes mean there is manipulation happening. Why are people 20x more likely to be commenting in one thread over the other? It shows both a different conversation and a different audience. This is the &#39;difference&#39; i am referring to.</p>

<p>If we have non-political conspiracy posts with a 5% comment to vote ratio, and then all the political posts have massive comment sliding and engagement ratios that are completely out of whack with reality, we can deduce that there might be something fishy going on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, the mod said they were testing using contest mode for EVERY political post, but he did not say that was the only criteria by which they use contest mode.</p>

<p>Look back at the first time they used it. The mods were clear - it has to do with vote/comment totals and strange behaviors on the board. When a thread seems to be hit by influencers, they activate contest mode to try to disrupt it. How is that a bad idea?</p>

<p>Again, the mods didn&#39;t say what you say they did. You are pretending that they base this stuff on only one factor, which is not true from what I have seen from the mods.</p>

<p>Also, the mods are in open conflict. Whatever mod you spoke to may not represent the whole.</p>

<p>Because people don&#39;t come to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> for politics. That&#39;s why <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> and <a href="/r/The_donald">/r/The_donald</a> exist.

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s going to be very difficult to separate political conspiracies from non-political conspiracies. At some level, just about everything posted here is political. For example, is Seth Rich a political conspiracy theory? On one hand there are people who believe that it&#39;s a simple investigation into an unsolved murder. On the other hand, it&#39;s been a central part of pro-Trump messaging for the last year. I just think it&#39;s going to be more trouble than it&#39;s worth, and you&#39;re going to catch criticism no matter what.</p>

<p>Also, how have these trial threads been chosen? I don&#39;t to to the front page here very often, but I don&#39;t remember seeing a contest mode thread that <em>wasn&#39;t</em> a bad story for Trump</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Appreciate the reply. As I&#39;m sure many others do. </p>

<p>Feedback, flair posts as political and add filters. That way if users themselves don&#39;t want to see political posts the users can decide whether or not their posts related to politics are removed or kept out of sight.</p>

<p>As it stands, all threads that are being put into contest mode are ones directly connected to Trump. Its really obvious that there are efforts being made to stop users from posting about him. </p>

<p>For a place that prides itself on allowing people to discuss ideas, this current modteam is doing the opposite when its about the president. </p>

<p>To me (and I am sure others) this just smacks of an attempt to silence any criticism of the president, which is especially disturbing action for a conspiracy theory board that should always be critical of those in power.</p>

<p>Contest mode has only been used on stories critical of trump, and the DNC related stories posted at this point are pretty much entirely spam. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you are not being fair in determining what creates &#39;contest mode&#39; conditions. </p>

<p>You are saying it has to do with the topic of discussion. However, I would argue that is just the results of the real effect.</p>

<p>The real effect that determines the mods use of contest mode is voting and comment behaviors that are inconsistent with similar threads and historical norms. If they see behavior that is consistent with manipulation efforts, it makes sense to activate something like contest mode. </p>

<p>When you claim that contest mode is only ever used in a single context, that might be because there is only a few influences that are actually powerful enough to trigger it&#39;s action. Go and post a pro-trump article with some substance to it and see how many comments and votes roll in. Then go do the opposite and see what happens. I think that&#39;s the difference - the type and intensity of attention. The reason other topics don&#39;t set off &#39;contest mode&#39; is because they don&#39;t generate enough interest to even notice they are there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for being open and upfront. I personally do not like contest mode. Its tiresome to have to expand to read all comments. I would rather see a one post per topic rule. No duplicate posts, etc. But I honestly dont know how much work that would be. </p>

<p>I mean people still vote in contest mode, so vote manipulation is still possible. </p>

<p>And what about users that spam threads with off topic posts? I tried to report one but I dont really see any rules against this. Is it possible to do somethimg about this? I check some of these histories and I see one month old accounts with like -200 Karma. Can you just stop accounts like that from posting? If someone really feels like they need a throwaway account on this sub, at least make them put some effort into their comments or building up their throwaway</p>

Many times there isn&#39;t a link to anywhere or there are only a few with little votes and no discussion. Who knows where they get their brigading excuse from then, besides it&#39;s an excuse when votes/discussion doesn&#39;t go their preferred way.</p>

<p>Is this a rough estimate or a number you just picked? Can you show the math for your estimate? No you cant. That estimate isnt true without the math to back it up.

    <div class="md"><p>In something completely unrelated to your post, I once read an article that showed George Soros was funding an astroturf campaign through David Brock/John Podesta MediaMatters, Correct the Record and the scumbag, fascist commies at ShareBlue (aka progressives) to infiltrate sites like Reddit, Facebook and Twitter. They run about 50 accounts each to give the false impression that their view and ideology is mainstream, when in reality, nothing could be further from the truth. Those people are described perfectly in the book 1984. You know, the ones who proclaim &quot;Ignorance is Strength!&quot; It&#39;s funny because they actually think it&#39;s working. If it&#39;s true that this happens, it&#39;s completely desperate and pathetic. </p>

<p>Why the fuck do the pro-government people here keep spreading these lies without evidence?</p>

<p>Everyone in the world that disagrees with you is some sort of shill or bot? It&#39;s not possible that people hate a proud racist who brags about sexual abusing women, says he wants to murder people&#39;s families, and has billions of dollars tied up with Russian interests?</p>

<p>Get out of the box and have a look at the world around you. Look at the opinion polls, look at the internet, talk to people outside of your circlejerk.</p>

<p>Trump is despised by most of the world and it sure as hell isn&#39;t sceptics that have decided he&#39;s pure and incorruptible.</p>

<p>The Koch brothers and News Corp have been around spreading lies and propaganda a lot longer and have had much more influence than the enemies they&#39;ve invented to make it seem like your support for the government isn&#39;t an aberration.</p>

<p>This comment was written by a real fucking human being who knows a lot of real fucking human beings who share this view, and I&#39;m definitely not going to be surprised when it turns out that all of the &quot;OMG so many CTR shareblue bots&quot; people all turn out to be shills for Cambridge Analytica.</p>

<p>But remember, they are just imaginary downvotes and they don&#39;t mean a thing IRL. Actually, the amount of negative downvotes only gives me confirmation that my words are nothing but truth. If what I said was false, there would be valid comments against my statement. But they never challenge the truth.. Only computer downvote scripts.. American propaganda is literal shit lol</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would love for the mods to post a public list of all of the threads thrown into contest mode, and which mod put that thread into contest mode.  Every time a thread is put in contest mode, a pinned mod message by the mod that changed the mode should be made in the thread. Most of the time it is another mod that posts a pinned message, if any message is pinned at all.</p>

<p>And if the mods can please post a detailed guideline to how they determine whether a thread is being brigaded or not. Simply stating that many of the users in a thread come from another subreddit should be backed up by data that can be seen by the sub&#39;s users and a proper review process. People should be able to independently verify a mod&#39;s claims when they do this.</p>

<p>Almost every time I see a major Trump Russia related reveal on this sub, I can predict usually if it is going to be put into contest mode or not. The mods should get a handle on this, because more and more of these reveals are coming and they are only going to get bigger and bigger.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That seems consistent with what I&#39;ve heard from others. I tried messaging the mods once over a clarification on the rules. Rule 6 says no &quot;shouting&quot; with excessive bold and enlarged fonts and whatnot.</p>

<p>I was polite and civil and referred to a certain user who was spamming comment sections with comments like</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>This has to blow the liberal lunatics gaskets!</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>and</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You&#39;ve been trolled by POTUS. I love it.</p>

<p><strong>MAGA</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m not going to imitate it but both comments were using headers (#) before the text so the text was huge. Either way, multiple blatant rule violations that should be removed.</p>

<p>What I got in return from the mods was a bunch of attitude. One mod in particular was really disrespectful and would toss insults around while saying &quot;go back to <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>&quot; while another would say that the rules are up to moderator&#39;s discretion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Consistent with my experience as well, it seems like they take any criticism or questioning as an attack. </p>

<p>A user was banned &quot;for shilling for paedos&quot; so I tried asking the mods about it. At first I was told that wasn&#39;t the reason, so when I responded with a screenshot showing that as the ban message I was muted and reported to the admins because they thought I was the banned user. Every message I received was immature, it&#39;s like they&#39;ve never been in positions of leadership/power before. </p>

<p>There&#39;s a weird little war going on behind the scenes of this subreddit. I don&#39;t even know how you go about solving something like that.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t believe that you are COMPLAINING that all the mods of this sub do NOT march in Lockstep on every issue. You should be celebrating that fact.</p>

<p>Yes, there ARE disagreements among the mods. Yes, there ARE discussions, and no, it is NOT easy to find the &quot;right&quot; answers to dealing with complicated problems <em>(like handling armies of trolls, shills and bots that brigade the hell out of this sub when certain &quot;sensitive&quot; issues come up)</em></p>

<p>Would you REALLY want a mod team that was in TOTAL AGREEMENT on everything? What if YOU happened to DISAGREE with the positions the mods took???</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a clue: The mods get accused of being Pro-Trump right-wingers <strong><em>AND</em></strong> of being Share Blue Lefties <strong><em>all day every day</em></strong>.</p>

<p>We are clearly pissing BOTH sides off - and to me, that can means only on thing: We&#39;re doing SOMETHING RIGHT.</p>

<p>Edit: For full disclosure, here was his only private message when I asked about my ban <strong>and about why they use contest mode</strong>. Begins with him quoting my comment:</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t ban you. I didn&#39;t know why you were banned, but I DID answer your question as to why Contest Mode was being implimented:</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>contest mode is unacceptable as a sudden solution to what one mod may think is showing &quot;unusual voting patterns&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Contest Mode is to Trolls and Shills...</p>

<p>...As a House of Mirrors is to a Gaggle of Vampires</p>

<p>Be grateful that we haven&#39;t dragged out the Crosses and Garlic... YET</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m sorry, I was trying to lighten the mood with a bit of levity. Was my use of similes too &quot;cryptic&quot;? Did you not comprehend the message? That Contest Mode is intended to foil the efforts of trolls, shills and organized brigades?</p>

<p>Sorry. I didn&#39;t mean to belittle you.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Contest mode doesn&#39;t seem to fix what it&#39;s being issued against</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That remains to be seen, doesn&#39;t it?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and it seems like <strong>outsider forces can use brigading</strong> to purposely force a moderator to turn to contest mode which stifles conversation</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, there are potential downsides, and these aspects have come up and are being discussed. But I am pleased to see that you acknowledge that there are indeed <strong>&quot;outsider forces&quot;</strong> who  <strong>&quot;use brigading&quot;</strong> to purposely attack the sub.</p>

<p>Do you NOW understand a bit more about what we are up against here? </p>

<p>We want to allow and promote free and open discussion - but the OUTSIDE FORCES you mentioned are intent on destroying open discussion by using brigading to manipulate the threads and subvert conversations to serve whatever agenda they may be promoting.</p>

<p>We are trying to do what we can to thwart their pernicious efforts using the limited number of tools that we have available to us.</p>

<p>And you DID eventually have your problem resolved, and your ban lifted, did you not? We are more than a bit overwhelmed, and the vast majority of the complaints we receive are extremely hostile - it starts to wear you down after a while</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Compare that to the time I had to deal with the mods in <strong><a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a></strong> who explained exactly what the problem was, what rule was broken, and what I had to do to fix it. Clear as day communication.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As I said before, I did not ban you, and had no knowledge of why you were banned. But I did explain clearly (if cryptically) why we were implementing contest mode. If I personally offended you, I apologize, and I will make an effort to be more considerate in the future.</p>

<p>Okay?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Okay, what can we do to actually avoid brigading without completely obfuscating conversation and making people create posts asking &#39;why we did that&#39; each time it happens&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah, we&#39;ve been doing that for MONTHS, and we&#39;ve had several members chime in with ideas. If we had ADMINISTRATIVE tools - or at least their cooperation - we might be able to accomplish this illusive goal, but at the moment, we must do what can with what we have.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never accused <em>you</em> of banning me, so I find it curious that you&#39;re defending yourself from such an accusation. It was another mod who was throwing the most sass and being the least helpful and downright childish. I&#39;m sure you could view his messages as well. That&#39;s what I was referring too when I said the moderators should at least be professional about their responsibilities. </p>

<p>My ban was lifted, but it took me sending a couple test comments the following morning to discover this. Like someone maybe didn&#39;t wanna acknowledge it? I don&#39;t know, maybe that&#39;s how you guys operate, but it seems like a conspiracy subreddit would want to be more transparent. Maybe I&#39;m mistaken and you require cloak and dagger tactics to moderate a forum set up to root out clock and dagger tactics. </p>

<p>All I ever wanted, before I started questioning the moderator&#39;s actions, was some darn transparency on why contest mode was enabled. I&#39;ve speculated it&#39;s political, but all we can do is speculate because no mods want to clue anyone in. All we get is vague accusations of brigading and each mod has a different degree to which they believe it&#39;s occuring. Official comments from mods become distorted and lost in a sea of unrated, unorganized, and hidden comments in contest mode posts. After contest mode, a flood of &quot;why is this in contest mode?&quot; posts blanket the topic and discussion, actual discussion about the topic, is buried. Spam reigns tall. </p>

<p>And we&#39;re left to speculate. And then, we get this defensive nonsense from some of you guys. About how tough it is, and how hard you&#39;ve been working on it for months. Obfuscating the issue by saying we want a hive mind moderator. And <em>still no answer as to why contest mode is enabled</em>. No specifics. No comments you can point to and be like, &quot;Yeah, see these here?&quot; </p>

<p>But hopefully by the next day, we&#39;ve moved on to a topic that&#39;s approved by whatever group is brigading and they don&#39;t attack it so you guys squash the discussion. We&#39;ll see what tomorrow brings, I guess. </p>

<p>And if you do it off of reddit, like in Discord, then you can claim deniability and protect the origin of the manipulation.  Contest mode solves nothing and has become a tool to defeat discussion.  </p>

<p>Where are the martyrs here? What threads were not put into contest mode that should have? I&#39;ve seen plenty of anti-Trump threads go into contest mode, but as soon as that happens you claim it as a &#39;pro-Trump&#39; thread because there is an argument and duality exists. As long as there is a response, you can call it either because both are involved. It&#39;s not honest.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t block people. Especially shills, I just tag them and move on. I am <strong>not</strong> a Trump supporter. But I mean what I said about he versus Hillary. At least we know he&#39;s a douche, and at least he is causing people to realize how fucked up our government is. Hillary would&#39;ve continued the usual puppet show behind closed doors so everyone remained clueless. </p>

<p>Trump has that shit on front street for all to see, and it&#39;s causing even the wooliest of sheep to wake up. This scares the Deep State, the GOP, the DNC .. all of them are terrified that we will all wake up. Hence the mass effort to cause division and anger, and now an effort to start a war with the Norks. And what do they use to cause division? Shills and fear. </p>

<p>That&#39;s not the case at all though. I&#39;m not a shill, and I have a lot of problems with the way contest mode is being used to silence criticism of Trump and the government while ignoring all of the irrelevant crap about the DNC. Feel free to look through my comment history if that helps, though I&#39;m not sure there&#39;s anything that would convince you I just feel this way and don&#39;t have to be paid to say this.</p>

<p>The idiotic and pathetic claim that everyone that disagrees with you is a shill is becoming one of the biggest problems on this subreddit - even worse than the brigades from T_D, even worse than the moderators being unashamed about their extreme pro-government biases, even worse than actual shills themselves.</p>

<p>At this point I&#39;m almost completely convinced that every account that keeps repeating that anti-Trump/anti-government people are shills are in fact shills themselves, deliberately conflating the situation and making it difficult to differentiate between the organic users and the Koch brothers bots.</p>

<p>Of course, this means little to people who have been brainwashed by the lies and the divide and conquer tactics of <del>the MSM</del> Fox News, and it&#39;s hard to tell the difference between an uneducated idiot without coherent language skills, and a poorly programmed bot.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have a point. Multiple points, actually. </p>

<p>Except personally, I have no problems with differing opinions at all. I welcome those opinions and enjoy good, organic discussion and debate on those opinions. </p>

<p>The people I am referring to as &quot;shills&quot; are the ones who no matter what evidence you present, they will constantly deflect. They take over a thread with bots, and comments having only the purpose of division behind them. </p>

<p>No matter what you show them, or say, they will find a way to turn it around and fit their narrative. Yes, there is evidence of shady shit with the Trump administration, which should not go unchecked. </p>

<p>At the same time, those crimes do not, at all, negate the crimes of the DNC, Deep State and other members of the GOP. The Deep State are using Trump as a means to get the eyes off of their own crimes. What I have a problem with is mindless sheep acting like Trump and the right are the only crooked mother fuckers in DC. </p>

<p>THEY&#39;RE ALL CROOKED. And they <strong>ALL</strong> need to be brought down and made to pay for their crimes. </p>

<p>As for contest mode; I&#39;ve been around here awhile. I&#39;ve seen threads get brigaded and taken over, and I can say that the contest mode is curbing that to an extent. Look at all the jimmies that get rustled when a thread goes contest. That&#39;s a clue. &quot;They&quot; don&#39;t want votes hidden. Real users of this sub couldn&#39;t give a fuck less about votes.

<p>Right. Except the DNC has no political power and the GOP controls every layer of government. You&#39;re yelling at ghosts while real people commit real crimes using the real power they currently wield.</p>

<p>I loathe the DNC, but to pretend like it&#39;s anywhere at all as important to criticise that powerless and irrelevant organisation while the GOP controls the entire US government is laughable.</p>

<p>Unfortunately this subreddit has a lot of people (like you) who simply <em>don&#39;t want to</em> talk about the corruption of Trump and the GOP, deflecting constantly to the DNC and other powerless and irrelevant parties in order to keep people distracted from the real conspiracies.</p>

<p>Once again, your bias has prejudiced your perspective here, and you&#39;re ignoring the fact that <em>only anti-government stories are being censored with contest mode</em>. If you want contest mode so badly, why don&#39;t you petition for it to be put on every thread, including all the irrelevant bullshit about the DNC and the debunked lies about Seth Rich?</p>

<p>Once again, I&#39;m a real person not being paid to say this, and I think it&#39;s fucking disgusting that self-proclaimed &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot; are okay with censoring anti-government stories in order to protect the feelings of the POTUS and his tiny band of vocal sycophants. Like I said, it&#39;s not stories critical of the DNC that get put into contest mode. It&#39;s not stories about aliens or JFK. It&#39;s only stories critical of Trump and his government.</p>

<p>You&#39;re cheering for censorship of criticism of the government in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, and the worst part is that there are so many pro-Trump bots and shills here to make it seem like people agree with that idea.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>By censoring anti-government posts with contest mode or selectively applied rules, and at the same time leaving pro-government propaganda untouched, you&#39;re advocating for the opposite of organic discussion. You&#39;re advocating for a safe space.</p>

<p>Yeah, I stopped here. </p>

<p>You go lumping me in as someone who is a Trump homer when I&#39;ve clearly states the obvious. </p>

<p>Where did I say I didn&#39;t want any investigations done? I do. I just think it&#39;s a fucking ignorant train of thought to believe that one side should face the music while the other side doesn&#39;t. </p>

<p>For someone who hates the DNC, you seem awfully okay with letting them get away scot-free just so we can bring down our current version of theater. </p>

<p>Thinking the DNC has no power right now is fucking laughable at best. So I go back to what I said; they&#39;re <strong>all</strong> crooked. </p>

<p>As smart as you are, I&#39;m smarter. I&#39;ve noted you making sure to repeat that you&#39;re a real person. You&#39;ve also made it a point to make sure we all know you aren&#39;t getting paid. </p>

<p>So, you&#39;ve lowkey defended the DNC by basically implying they have no power therefore we shouldn&#39;t worry about them. You&#39;ve assured me multiple times that you&#39;re real. And you&#39;ve made it a point to say you aren&#39;t being paid. Now, I have now doubts you&#39;re a real person and not a shill, but fuck me, can&#39;t you see how that&#39;s suspicious? </p>

<p>In reading what I did of your reply to me, it appears as though what I said went right over your head. You still try to paint me up as a Trump homer when I said nothing remotely close to what you are saying I did. </p>

<p>I have a rule about getting sucked into bullshit pissing contests, which is exactly what you are trying to attain here. </p>

<p>I didn&#39;t say you&#39;re a Trump supporter and I didn&#39;t mean to imply that, because I did see your earlier comment. But you&#39;re okay with the fact that people are focusing on the party that&#39;s not in power, the party that&#39;s been abandoned by their entire voterbase, and that&#39;s had a historic and almost unprecedented loss of political power in a single election. You seem okay with the fact that the DNC is getting <em>more</em> attention than the GOP despite the GOP controlling the whole government, and despite the GOP historically having been the primary party of war and stealing liberties in the name of &#39;security&#39;.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m definitely not okay with the DNC getting away with anything, but focusing on the DNC while the GOP controls the entire government is literally letting the GOP get away with <em>everything</em>. </p>

<p>The DNC is not controlling the CIA. The DNC is not in charge of the FBI. The DNC is not giving orders to the military. The DNC is not writing laws and executive orders. Those are all being done by Trump and the GOP right now, and that&#39;s much more important than Benghazi bullshit or whatever the latest Fox News distraction from the past is.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s not what I said and I&#39;m sorry if I implied that. I&#39;m pointing out how you&#39;re &quot;lowkey defending Trump&quot; by basically implying that the DNC is equally relevant in politics to Trump and the GOP - the people that literally control the entire US government.</p>

<p>I know you don&#39;t want to be associated with obsequious Trumpets, but it&#39;s hard to dissociate everyone who yells &quot;shill bot!&quot; about anti-government conspiracy theorists when it only ever comes in response to the worst abuses and corruption of Trump/GOP.</p>

<p>At the same time, you&#39;re either unable to grasp why the <em>relatively</em> powerless DNC doesn&#39;t deserve <em>more</em> scrutiny than the people controlling the entire government, or you&#39;re being disingenuous and deliberately trying to muddy the waters so that a discussion about Trump/GOP corruption can&#39;t ever be properly undertaken here. I&#39;d like to believe it&#39;s the former because you&#39;ve given thoughtful and detailed responses, but effectively the result is the same - the GOP and Trump get to fly under the radar while the relatively petty crimes of ousted Democrats are distracting from the GOP&#39;s own major and deeply concerning scandals and abuses.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think there is a pretty big split in this sub right now. A large chunk of users who view the Trump/Russia story as potentially one of the biggest conspiracies in our lifetime, and another group who views it as a witch hunt. I think the first group is very frustrated with the traction topics like Seth Rich receive and the other group frustrated by the amount of attention Trump/Russia receives.</p>

<p>Both sides accuse the other of vote manipulation, but I personally don&#39;t buy into that. I think you have almost half a million people subscribing to a sub, half of them agree with one narrative while the other half believes in something diametrically opposed to it.

<p>Sorry pal, did you miss the list of rules in the sidebar?  <strong>-----&gt;</strong></p>

<p><em>&quot;calling a shill a shill&quot;</em> violates those rules. You were not banned, or even officially warned - YET.</p>

<p>The purpose of Rule 10 is to try to keep discussions centered on the topics at hand, and to prevent the threads being sullied by devolving into ad  hominem mud-slinging fests.</p>

<p>In the threads, address what others have SAID - their arguments and positions. If you have problems with the behavior of a user, address your concerns to the moderators. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because one is actually real. And the other are right wing smear jobs by non credible known liars who edit their videos to push a narrative.</p>

<p>They hacked the DNC  as supported by all our intelligence agencies and our allies. They even did the same thing in Frances recent election. Hacking the only liberal partys emails and releasing them and spreading lies about said emails. They literally used the exact same tactic in another western election a few monthe later.</p>

<p>They also hacked voter rOlla and purged voter registrations, while not directly changing votes, de-registering people has to essentially the same effect. We do not yet know the extent of their attempts or damage done as its still being investigated. </p>

<p>holy shit is this true?</p>

<p>i KNEW that trans shit was just a distraction. something thats not super important (i know it is very important for some people, but doesnt affect the country as a whole) but stirs up the base and typically dominates the news cycle</p>

<p>I thought it would be to distract from the inevitable firing of sessions, but this makes so much sense. he probably thought the news would run with it as soon as it happened.</p>

<p>Nice attempts to gaslight. </p>

<p>All you&#39;re doing is deflecting with this post. You can&#39;t even point to a single thread attacking Hilary in the months that the mod-log tracks threads that was put to contest mode. Meanwhile, there are multiple threads about Trump set to contest mode just in the past few weeks. </p>

<p>You go lumping me in as someone who is a Trump homer when I&#39;ve clearly stated the opposite. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I didn&#39;t say you&#39;re a Trump supporter and I didn&#39;t mean to imply that, because I did see your earlier comment. But you&#39;re okay with the fact that people are focusing on the party that&#39;s not in power, the party that&#39;s been abandoned by their entire voterbase, and that&#39;s had a historic and almost unprecedented loss of political power in a single election. You seem okay with the fact that the DNC is getting <em>more</em> attention than the GOP despite the GOP controlling the whole government, and despite the GOP historically having been the primary party of war and stealing liberties in the name of &#39;security&#39;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For someone who hates the DNC, you seem awfully okay with letting them get away scot-free just so we can bring down our current version of theater. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m definitely not okay with the DNC getting away with anything, but focusing on the DNC while the GOP controls the entire government is literally letting the GOP get away with <em>everything</em>. </p>

<p>The DNC is not controlling the CIA. The DNC is not in charge of the FBI. The DNC is not giving orders to the military. The DNC is not writing laws and executive orders. Those are all being done by Trump and the GOP right now, and that&#39;s much more important than Benghazi bullshit or whatever the latest Fox News distraction from the past is.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In reading what I did of your reply to me, it appears as though what I said went right over your head. You still try to paint me up as a Trump homer when I said nothing remotely close to what you are saying I did. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s not what I said and I&#39;m sorry if I implied that. I&#39;m pointing out how you&#39;re &quot;lowkey defending Trump&quot; by basically implying that the DNC is equally relevant in politics to Trump and the GOP - the people that literally control the entire US government.</p>

<p>I know you don&#39;t want to be associated with obsequious Trumpets, but it&#39;s hard to dissociate everyone who yells &quot;shill bot!&quot; about anti-government conspiracy theorists when it only ever comes in response to the worst abuses and corruption of Trump/GOP.</p>

<p>At the same time, you&#39;re either unable to grasp why the <em>relatively</em> powerless DNC doesn&#39;t deserve <em>more</em> scrutiny than the people controlling the entire government, or you&#39;re being disingenuous and deliberately trying to muddy the waters so that a discussion about Trump/GOP corruption can&#39;t ever be properly undertaken here. I&#39;d like to believe it&#39;s the former because you&#39;ve given thoughtful and detailed responses, but effectively the result is the same - the GOP and Trump get to fly under the radar while the relatively petty crimes of ousted Democrats are distracting from the GOP&#39;s own major and deeply concerning scandals and abuses.</p>
