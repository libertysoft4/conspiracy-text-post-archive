<p>This article here tells me they were already planning on it.</p>

<p>I also suspect that we will find out that for whatever reason they come up with...Trump will not be able to return to the White House immediately.</p>

<p>Find out soon enough.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t understand the new reticence in starting some more wars. They have done it countless times and no one did shit. Well, they kinda did when it was Bush, but it seemed less about anti-war and more about anti-Bush. When Obama wanted to do Syria, we kicked up a good stink over that and they backed off. Then immediately took out Libya with nary a peep. </p>

<p>But I think with the level of propaganda saturation we are living in now, they could go after Iran or NK without much of a squeal from anyone. Shoot, they could probably declare war on Russia and half of the US would think that was downright sensible.</p>

<p>It is obvious they are going to start one of these wars, why aren&#39;t they pulling the trigger I wonder? Are they trying to draw the foul maybe?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yeah, it does seem weird to use such rhetoric yet see no action.  when you compare events like this to playground activities - it sometimes helps me understand the motivations.</p>

<p>So you have a playground that knows there is a bully (USA) looking for a fight, hasn&#39;t had a real fight in a long time.  It is calling out a few small shitstarters like (NK) but also squaring off with another tough guy (Russia).</p>

<p>so waiting for the playground to team up on the big bully to neutralize it?  Or are they all playing a game of chicken hoping they aren&#39;t the focus?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If it&#39;s going down..it&#39;s an &quot;all the marbles&quot; situation.</p>

<p>Trump is first target..whether that&#39;s by Mueller (who we know played a key role in the Iraq War) coming out and announcing that due to evidence..Trump&#39;s security clearance has been suspended. He won&#39;t need to present the evidence immediately because whatever they have planned for North Korea will happen before that. That will take precedence.</p>

<p>Congress has emergency session votes that Trump is not mentally capable. </p>

<p>Worst case scenario - Terrorist attack. They&#39;ve already been priming the pump on this one with reports here and there from ISIS threatening the west and the President.</p>

<p>Israel will attack Syria..because..whatever the CIA has planned since their program got cut..is already in place and ready to go. Israel always takes advantage of situations like this. </p>

<p>This is all just outlandish theorizing...but you know me. I always do this when the red flags start popping up.</p>

<p>The timing is what&#39;s got me thinking its possible.</p>
