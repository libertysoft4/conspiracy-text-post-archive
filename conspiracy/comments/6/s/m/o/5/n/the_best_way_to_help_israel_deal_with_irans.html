    <div class="md"><p>Soros is another head on the hydra.</p>

<p>The power of the Zionists is in their tight knit, highly organized and very well financed collaboration working to achieve ethnically based goals.</p>

<p>They do this through control of the media, and more importantly, through their infiltration of government apparatuses and their coercive control over our corrupted politicians.</p>

<p>The political aspect is their Achilles Heel. To disrupt their control of politicians we need only to make cooperation with Zionists so politically painful that they will have no choice but to abandon these traitors.</p>

<p>It can be done, but we should not make the mistake of underestimating the power, resourcefulness and drive of our enemy.</p>

<p>And make no mistake, they are our enemy.</p>

<p>If your primary concern is to avoid being labeled an anti--semite, you mght as well surrender now. You&#39;ve already lost.</p>

<p>That pejorative term is hurled at anyone and everyone who opposes their agenda, and finding yourself on the defensive means you have lost.</p>

<p>All previous colonization has been a colonization by conquest. Every people originally colonized the land that later became its historic homeland by force. The Greeks did that, and the Angles and the Saxons, and in a late age those who were to become Americans. The Jews, impelled to return to their historic homeland both by an inextinguishable yearning and by an unanswerable need, have used no force. They have bought every unit of land that they possess from its Arab owners. Next, they have earned that land a second time by reclaiming it from desert and wilderness. With that reclamation of lost land as a foundation, they have built up for all the inhabitants of Palestine a higher civilization. Wherever there is a Jewish colony the Arabs flourish both economically and socially.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is not from Hillary Clinton. It&#39;s a quote from a <a href="https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/18328">draft</a> of an essay by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Rubin">James Rubin</a> that he <a href="https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/18361">sent to Hillary Clinton</a> with the note:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I wanted to pass on something I intend to publish on Syria and Iran, because I think it is worth trying to urge the President and his political advisers to act. As you can see from today&#39;s column by Jackson Diehl, the pundits and many in the media will push the Syria issue very hard for the foreseeable future. It may not be on the front burner every day, but it will be close to or at the top of the media&#39;s attention indefinitely. Interestingly, the Republicans have showed their hand on the foreign policy debate, in which inaction on Syria is pretty much the only serious criticism they can offer that will stick. As you will see from the attached piece, I believe that action on Syria will forestall the biggest danger on the horizon, that Israel launches a surprise attack on Iran&#39;s nuclear facilities. Although the pressure has now eased for a variety of reasons, it will return. Action by Washington on Syria, on the other hand, I believe will eliminate much of the urgency for Israeli action. In other words, a more aggressive policy on Syria will eliminate the best case the republican&#39;s have going into the November election, will ease substantially the pressure on Israel to attack Iran and possibly spark a wider war in the Middle East, and finally would be the right stance on Syria going forward. I know you may not agree but I thought it was better to share this with you first as at least a new way to look at the problem. All best, your friend, Jamie </p>

<p>James P. Rubin</p>
