<p>I&#39;ve been lurking and participating here for a little longer than a year and have seen all kinds of thought provoking,nonsensical,educational or downright stupid stuff get posted.</p>

<p>But I really have to ask a question: What the fuck is up with all those &quot;Holocaust never happened,fuck the jews!&quot; posts?</p>

<p>Everyday there are 2 or 3 posts and the comments devolve into a shitfest of straight up racist,xenophobic,antisemetic and scientificaly wrong idiots talking about faked gas chambers,linking to neo-nazi blogs that try to retcon history with lies and supposed experts who are in support of neo-nazi organisations.</p>

<p>Clearly those posts are in violation of some rules we should adhere to but the problem is ignored.</p>

<p>It is really sad to see that a sub full of people upset with what they&#39;re fed by the government and the media stay silent in the presence of such blatant falsehoods,lies and attacks on millions of people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>See? You, just like most everyone else, IGNORE the fact that Jews were active participants in their OWN HISTORY. </p>

<p>Many seem to be under the impression that, all through history, Jews were just standing there on a street corner, minding their own business, when <strong><em>BAM!!!</em></strong> History drives by and slaps them for <strong><em>NO REASON!!!</em></strong> </p>

<p>The reason that so many believe this HORSESHIT is because for generations this idea has  been inculcated into society through the media (entertainment and news), through the education system (primary and secondary), through &quot;Evangelical&quot; churches, and, yes, through Western public policy.</p>

<p>Well bubs, it isn&#39;t true, and it is a VERY DANGEROUS belief for people to cling to, and those in the greatest danger of this continued fantasy are the Jews themselves.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a clue: The reason that Jews and Jewish communities have always clashed with their host nations and their neighbors is because of <strong><em>culture clash</em></strong>: </p>

<p><strong>Through most of the past 2,000 years</strong>, Jews have always been an extremely insular and ethnocentric group - based on religious and cultural grounds, there was almost no intermingling with non-Jews in cultural/ secular affairs, and intermarriage was strictly forbidden. The little interaction that Jews DID have with their Gentile neighbors was largely restricted to <strong><em>business matters</em></strong>. </p>

<p>Such business affairs were usually only conducted with the &quot;upper classes&quot; of the Gentiles - the Lords, Royals, etc. For example, in medieval Europe, Jews often contracted with these Gentiles (such as tax farming, landlording, moneylending, etc), and these &quot;unsavory&quot; functions often created animosity between Jews and their Gentile neighbors - and the two groups invariably saw one another as ALIENS.</p>

<p>On the whole, <strong><em>Jews refused to assimilate</em></strong> - to become part of the &quot;nations&quot; in which they dwelt, and it cannot be overemphasized that <strong><em>this was their own choice</em></strong>. They insisted on being treated as a SEPARATE NATION from their host countries - and their hosts largely accommodated this demand. Again, in medieval Europe, Jews CHOSE to live in their own &quot;gated communities&quot; the &quot;Ghettos&quot;, and they were generally given full autonomy in conducting their internal affairs - civil, legal and religious - WITHING their community, where the Rabbis ruled the roost.</p>

<p>In most cases, Gentile powers only intervened when disputes arose between Jews and Gentiles, and indeed, in many cases, Gentile authorities provided <strong><em>protection</em></strong> for Jews and Jewish communities as part of the contracts they entered into with the Gentile Lords, Royals, etc.</p>

<ul>
<li>Any time two or more distinct, immiscible (and largely dissociated) groups share the SAME living living space and competing for resources, power and other advantages, there WILL be divergence between perceived group interests - and CONFLICTS WILL ARISE. This happened REPEATEDLY during the centuries of Jewish Diaspora - and as Jews were always an ALIEN group, and always a minority, they often did NOT fare well in these conflicts. Is that such a surprise???</li>
</ul>

<p>This mutual agreement wherein Jews were treated as a <strong><em>separate nation</em></strong> among their host nations continued largely through the mid 1700&#39;s, when Jews the <strong><em>Emancipation Movement</em></strong> took root in Europe, and began to spread. The result being that many of the former &quot;restrictions&quot; that had been placed on Jews were lifted - BUT so were many of the protections and privileges that Jews had previously enjoyed PRIOR to emancipation. </p>

<p>Examples: Jews were obligated to perform military service for the country where they lived, whereas they had previously been exempt. Also, Jews who had previously had to answer only to Rabbinical authorities in most criminal and civil matters now found themselves being judged by the secular governments of the Gentile nations.</p>

<p>Emancipation meant that Jews began to be treated much as any OTHER citizen/resident of whatever country they lived in. Their &quot;Jewish National&quot; status was dissolved, and they were treated as British or French or Italian (or whatever) citizens of the &quot;Jewish Confession&quot;. Jews began freely intermingling socially and in business matters as never before - EVEN INTERMARRYING with non-Jews.</p>

<p>THEY WERE ASSIMILATING.</p>

<p>In many ways, this was seen as a &quot;blessing&quot; by both Jews and Gentiles alike, but for MANY Jews, emancipation was a DISASTER, as they they feared that Jews -
 as a Nation, as a Tribe, as a RACE, would become EXTINCT - not due to any holocaust, pogrom or other &quot;physical&quot; threat - but due to intermarriage, and assimilation - the fear was that they would simply FORGET that they WERE Jews, and breed themselves out of existence.</p>

<p>Assimilation was (and is) THE GREATEST THREAT to the &quot;survival&quot; of Jews as a Nation/ Race/ Species, and it was THIS threat that drove the Zionists to FORCE the creation of a Jewish State on the world, and FORCE their fellow Jews to MOVE THERE, whether they liked i or not.</p>

<p>So essentially, Zionism became the &quot;false savior&quot; of the Jews - and the Holocaust (and related persecution) served as a &quot;plague&quot; that FORCED the Jews to &quot;save themselves&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You really can&#39;t see how <em>A Holocaust Tale</em> could &quot;strongly encourage&quot; people to leave Europe and go to a new Homeland...?</p>

<p>If you&#39;d read it, it wasn&#39;t a rant.  It was an excellent summary of why Jews throughout history have been in conflict with every nation they exist in.  It&#39;s their own xenophobia, and absolute refusal to assimilate with their neighbors.  When this &quot;refusal&quot; weakened, and Jews began to assimilate, extreme steps were taken to stop it, or at least divert it.</p>

<p>Western monarchies and government&#39;s are just as culpable, for our current state of affairs, but the heritage, the legacy, the false prophesies they pursue are distinctly Jewish/Egyptian in nature.  And it&#39;s not anti-Semitic to point it out, any more than it&#39;s &quot;anti-elephant&quot;, to point out the elephant in the room.</p>

Somehow, the Jewish population went from 15.3 million in &#39;33, to 21.3 million during ww2, and back to 15.8 million Jews in &#39;48.

<p>Why did you go on such a rant? </p>

<p>Fighting the battle against ignorance and the malicious falsification of history, friend.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You just assumed I believed one thing and said random shit</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I didn&#39;t <em>assume</em> anything. You stated very clearly <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6smok8/what_has_this_sub_become/dldxypu/">what you believe:</a> </p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>&quot;It&#39;s from fear of the other, religious intolerance, being able to charge interest, Jesus. And then lots of rumours about them to spread fear and hate&quot;</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The above is a classic cookie-cutter recitation of <em>&quot;reasons&quot;</em> for so-called <em>&quot;historic anti-Semitism&quot;</em> that is not only cliché, it is utterly FALSE. </p>

<p>Sure, achieves the purpose for which it was created - to absolves Jews for any and all responsibility for ANY part they played in their own history - but that does NOT do Jews (or anyone else) any favors - as it denies the core issues that were at work throughout history, and CONTINUE to be at work to this day.</p>

<p>The ethnocentric Tribalism and Nationalism that generated and fed the historic <strong><em>clashes of culture</em></strong> that so often ended tragically for Jews continues to this day, shit is building up to hit the fan YET AGAIN, and there is little chance that it can be averted as long as the falsehoods you listed above continue to be parroted and believed.</p>

<p>Funny thing about people: If they don&#39;t believe that they NEED to change their behavior, they usually won&#39;t.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Zionism doesn&#39;t force Jews to go to israel, they can choose not to as many do</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not today. At least not directly and overtly. </p>

<p>But I was referring to Zionism in the early period - between its founding in 1986 and its culmination in the State of Israel 50 years later - AND in the ensuing decade.</p>

<p>Zionism was NOT a popular movement among Jews. They were, <em>(with some notable exceptions, such as Czarist Russia)</em>, quite happy living where they were - in England, in France, in Austria, and <strong><em>especially in Germany</em></strong>: Prior to and during WW1, German Jews were among the MOST assimilated, widely accepted and prosperous of any Jewish population. </p>

<p>Compared to their Eastern European counterparts (the so-called &quot;Ostjuden&quot;), Western European Jews tended to be highly educated, affluent, and savvy in the realms of civics, politics, finance, diplomacy and in possessed with many OTHER talents that made them IDEAL candidates for laying the foundations of the State of Israel that the Zionists had been working SO HARD to achieve. </p>

<p>The problem is, these highly desirable Western European Jews were <strong><em>especially stubborn</em></strong>, refusing to abandon their lives and livelihood for the sake of what they saw as a wiled-eyed and dangerous scheme in some primitive land that was already occupied by natives who had lived there for generations.</p>

<p>Prior to the rise of Hitler in 1933, most of the Jews that migrated to Palestine were either hard-core Zionist Zealots, or downtrodden outcasts from Eastern Europe. </p>

<p>The Zionists knew that without enough Jews - <em>and the right kind of Jews</em>, their scheme would FAIL. </p>

<p>Fortunately for the Zionists, the systematic persecution of Jews by Hitler and Company provided these Jews with the enough <strong><em>incentive</em></strong> that they made the move. They had little choice.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>some &quot;conspiracies&quot; were just the noting positive corelations between two or more objective facts. correlation does not equal causation, but even today positive correlations are interpretted as causation by any not trained at some le el in logic.</p>

<p>example--jews were blamed for the black death in many european towns. this was usually based on the positive correlation between a jewish merchant visiting the town and then the outbreak occuring, and it is very likely that the merchant was in fact the vector given the isolation of most towns and that christians were almost all bound to the land, and weren&#39;t free to go anywhere. this isn&#39;t antisemitism, it is analysis based on what we in the 21st century know about disease transmission and history (unless you are an anti-vaxxer--then you know neither).</p>

<p>the townspeople, who were rightly terrified and dropping dead like flies, lashed out. they did not have disease theory or know about incubation periods. the disease did not occur immediately, so they assumed the peddlar gave his fellow jews, whom he most certainly would have stayed with, something they could infect the town with. in most of these towns, many people owed money to jews because lending money and ursury was a venal sin in catholicism (thus the protest reformation, whose first act after stealing all of the monks belo gi gs was to legalize money-lending and ursury). everybody hates their lenders. in these circumstances the disease was viewed as retribution for failure to repay their debts, and to be fare, there were numerous accounts of lenders confiscating property while people lay dying in their homes. there was ugliness all around. </p>

<p>jews have made the same faulty and barbaric conclusions themselves throughout history.</p>

<p>and some conspiracies were just bigotted, opportunistic covers for stealing land, resources, and property. again, this is not at all unnique to jewish victims...just ask the irish, native americans, tibetans, congolese...palestians...</p>

<p>people are shitty.</p>

<p>i&#39;m atheist, despite having been visited this week by what i can only call an imp. if anyone has any imps, they are deathly afraid of house cats. mine charged it hissing and scared it off. i have been so bothered by the imp, i got several night lights, one for each wall. fwiw it was black and about 2 feet tall sitting down.</p>

Somehow it is ok here to blame the Jews but not blame other religious or culture groups, except of course Muslims but even Muslims are not treated to the anti-Jewish hate-fest we see here. </p>

<p>I agree OP it is disturbing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Partly this is a backlash from Jewish/Israeli organisations being so aggressive towards critics and insisting on using &quot;anti Semetic&quot; instead of racism, as if racism towards Jews is somehow worse then racism in general. </p>

<p>by the way, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semitic_people">the semetic people</a> are extinct, and i while it is commonly understood the term anti semetic means anti-jew i see no purpose for this other then to cause division...</p>

<p>And that brings me to part2; Zionists, like Muslims, are &quot;not a race&quot; of people, just like people who play soccer are not a race of people, or Jehovahs or scientologists are not &quot;races&quot; of people.</p>

<p>So the bias, dislike or hatred people have for these groups is not based on unchangeable conditions your born with such as race and sex and the physical attributes associated with that.</p>

<p>Ofcourse there is some people who just hate the jewish race and love hitler, that is disturbing but better to just &quot;keep calm and don&#39;t feed the troll&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Which Germans was this?  You&#39;ll have to elaborate a bit.</p>

<p>And by &quot;millions&quot; of witnesses, you probably mean dozens, who were all quite spectacularly able to just walk out of gas chambers, escape certain death, and were all the last surviving member of the family, and who profited greatly from telling their lies to any of the nearest propaganda outlets.</p>

<p>Strangely enough, there&#39;s just as many &quot;millions&quot; talking about their day to day activities, like acting in plays, putting on musicals, playing sports, etc.  Kinda strange activities, to be having at extermination camps.  It&#39;s almost like they were all at concentration camps, doing forced labor, like many of the other &quot;undesirables&quot; of the Nazi party.  </p>

<p>Conditions were frequently bad, and unbearable at the end of the war, but it was far from an extermination of a people.  The zionists went on to capitalize on this &quot;tragedy&quot; by extorting billions of dollars from the Germans, invading palestine illegally, and torturing, oppressing, murdering their neighbors every day since.  So there&#39;s legitimate interest in whether the Holocaust actually happened or not.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s unfortunate that he calls it an evacuation of Jews, in the same breath.  It&#39;s just vague enough to convey what people want it to say.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll give you this, as one of the &quot;debatable&quot; pieces of evidence.  It&#39;s bizarre that the only official references to a nationwide extermination program, with death facilities, thousands of troops, and 6 million bodies only has a cryptic reference, one forged &quot;secret meeting&quot; document, and a small handful of torture induced confessions.  For all the infrastructure they built in this convoluted extermination, there sure isn&#39;t much to show for it.</p>
