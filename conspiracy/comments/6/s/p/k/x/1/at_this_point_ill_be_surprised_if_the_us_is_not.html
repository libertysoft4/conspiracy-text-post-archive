    <div class="md"><p>I will say, in all the past NK threats we&#39;ve seen over the years, there&#39;s never been such a realistic &quot;timeline&quot; attached (other than them just saying XYZ attack is &#39;imminent&#39;). To say they&#39;re gonna try to strike Guam (specific location) in mid-August (specific time period) is just.....yikes.</p>

A war with NK means a global conflict and as much shit as Trump talks that sort of conflict would put us in a conflict that would cause his business interests to suffer.

<p>Good point.  That&#39;s hopeful.  Yes.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>People are becoming more and more aware of the bullshit and I think that&#39;s making enough social pressure to help.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah but is that enough to curtail the Totalitarian Tip Toe that&#39;s turned into a full on Totalitarian <em>Sprint</em> for some time now?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We&#39;re still slaves to the military industrial complex, but I think we&#39;re pointed in the right direction even if we&#39;re still pretty well fucked.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It seems we&#39;re getting there, but we better hurry our asses up because nobody&#39;s doing us any favors and time seems to be kind of running out.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It also helps that Trump is a crass jerk, while Obama was a smooth talker. Smooth talkers can create illegal war a lot more easily than crass jerks.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t disagree with that either, but the crass jerk certainly seems to be heavily compromised by the deep state at this point, so he&#39;s definitely making a push toward sending us all to hell in a hand basket.</p>

<p>Sure, but when Obama sent us to hell in a handbasket, he was cheered for it due to him hiding the reality of what was going on. Trump straight up says &quot;we should steal their oil.&quot; He straight up says &quot;Obama created ISIS.&quot; When you&#39;re bold and direct and honest in that way, it makes it harder for the MIC to do what it wants to do. </p>

<p>I <em>absolutely</em> wasn’t cheering.  Ever.  I can’t disagree with your overall sentiment, however, and I see what you’re saying.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s now been rumblings of a false flag being blamed on NK, so people are trying to figure out a) what&#39;s going to happen, but seemingly less important b) what they&#39;re going to use to overshadow their involvement.</p>

<p>A) the part that&#39;s got me worried isn&#39;t that nk will strike first. It&#39;s that once they see that the &quot;first strike&quot; is blamed on them, they will take <em>that</em> as the first strike. And retaliate immediately. </p>

<p>America slaps itself in the face, cries &quot;NKorea!&quot; Then organizes a retaliation. Nk will know at this point, they are doomed. They will have no reason to think otherwise. So they push the button.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not expecting Red Dawn and armed paratroopers, or even nukes in major cities. But they do have nukes and satellites. The ability to combine the two could kill 90% of America (EMP). I have also noticed that the news has inexplicably stopped mentioning EMPs as of a couple weeks ago.</p>

<p>But back to B) in less than 2 weeks, we&#39;ve got the mother of all distractions coming. <em>Literally</em> overshadowing the entire country.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Really not the bold of a prediction, which is what makes it scary. Being in tune with reality, while maintaining knowledge of historical precedents and trends, paints the future image of war with North Korea or Iran statistically probable. But account for NK, Iran, Russia, Syria, and ISIS (along with some other less well known players) and you have the statistical probability of World War 3 occurring within the next year. That&#39;s the bold prediction. Crazy times.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The hysteria is meant to drum up national security spending and arms sales in the region.  Unlike Iraq, Libya, and Syria, these countries are deathtraps with large armies dug into rough inhospitable terrain and large uncooperative populations that would be impossible to manage without inflating our army with a draft.  I don&#39;t think the elite are willing to push their luck with popular opinion that far.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No.  These tensions are being manufactured to bring the polities in the region into a hardline stance that we can then sell arms to.  We would never go to war with North Korea because that would destroy Seoul and thereby end their allegiance to the U.S.  The deep state wants this party to go on forever so that&#39;s right out.</p>

<p>Same for Iran.  The U.S. and Israel want Iran to exist as a threat to divide the Arab world, which the U.S. can also sell arms to.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No mention that we&#39;re edging towards WW3 under Trump and the Republican Party?</p>

<p>Obama and the Dems had a policy of containing NK and pressuring China, and it seemed to be working. Then Trump rolls in and threatens to bomb the shit out of NK. Why aren&#39;t people willing to criticise the current government over this?</p>
