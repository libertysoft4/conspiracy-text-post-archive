<p>Elites write him out of history books.</p>

<p>Ritchey had befriended Edgar J. Kaufmann. Kaufmann was the original owner of Fallingwater.  Fallingwater is one of if not the most popular pieces of American architecture. Kaufmann wanted Mitchell to redesign Fallingwater due to structural issues. </p>

<p>&quot;James A. Mitchell (1907-1999), a graduate of Carnegie Institute of Technology and Columbia Universities, was the lead design architect in the firm and deserves primary credit for the firm&#39;s assertive and sometimes innovative modern design work. He received U.S. patent 2,692,566 in 1954 for the design of a flexible folding roof that was developed for an early version of the firm&#39;s Civic Auditorium [Civic Arena] project. Mitchell left Pittsburgh soon after his partnership with Dahlen K. Ritchey was disolved in 1957, and was largely forgotten in Pittsburgh.&quot;</p>

<p>Largely forgotten is right. He&#39;s only written about in two historical articles I&#39;ve seen and is mentioned once in the newspaper. Sad stuff.</p>

<p><a href="http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1129&amp;dat=20020115&amp;id=KOlRAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=NXADAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6529,3340171">http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1129&amp;dat=20020115&amp;id=KOlRAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=NXADAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6529,3340171</a></p>

<p>Just found this government PDF with a load of information on him. He did win a shitload of awards, and I doubt this is everything:</p>

<p>&quot;James Anastasiou Mitchell (1907-1999) received a B.A. in Architecture from Carnegie Institute of Technology, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1932 and a M.S. from Columbia University in 1933. Mitchell was awarded a gold medal from the Beaux Arts Institute of Design in 1933 and was a finalist for the 1933 Paris Prize in Architecture. In 1934, Mitchell was awarded the John Stewardson Traveling Scholarship.&quot;</p>

<p>The whole thing about him receiving high praise in the military is completely true:</p>

<p>&quot;Mitchell and Ritchey established an architectural practice in 1938, but the practice was suspended from 1943 to 1946, when the partners served as officers in the U.S. Navy. Ritchey served as a radar officer on the U.S.S. Saratoga, while Mitchell initially served as Technical Assistant for Industrial Structures in Ordnance Stations, Bureau of Ordnance. Mitchell&#39;s exceptional talent as a planner earned him a promotion to Chief of the Facilities and Services Section in the Naval Ordnance Establishments Division of the bureau, a position which no person had held without attaining the rank of Admiral.&quot;</p>

<p>Nearly everything is true to a T. This is absurd:</p>

<p>&quot;Ritchey had befriended Edgar J. Kaufmann, head of a prominent Pittsburgh department store, while working for a year as a designer of window and furniture displays.8 This connection, along with Mitchell&#39;s reputation as a planner, resulted in Kaufmann selecting Mitchell &amp; Ritchey in 1946 to prepare a study and exhibition, &quot;Pittsburgh in Progress,&quot; to celebrate the store&#39;s seventy-fifth anniversary. &quot;Pittsburgh in Progress&quot; presented a daring vision of how Pittsburgh&#39;s infrastructure and natural environment could be transformed according to the tenets of modern planning and design.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The study&#39;s popularity and critical acclaim likely influenced Kaufmann&#39; s decision to engage the architects the next year to design a permanent home for the Civic Light Opera. In 1949, the Urban Redevelopment Authority of Pittsburgh entered into a contract with Mitchell &amp; Ritchey to design an amphitheater for the Civic Light Opera, which, in its final form, would be the Civic Arena.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;In addition to its work on the Civic Arena, Mitchell &amp; Ritchey designed several distinguished Pittsburgh projects in the mid-1950s, including the John Kane Memorial Hospital (planning and design services), Donner Hall at Carnegie Institute of Technology, and Mellon Square, which received national acclaim as the first urban park situated atop a parking garage.&quot;</p>

<p>Mitchell basically did all of the true architectural work, while Ritchey essentially got all the credit for it:</p>

<p>&quot;Both Mitchell and Ritchey shared responsibility for producing working drawings, but Mitchell&#39;s chief responsibilities were planning and design, while Ritchey&#39;s chief responsibilities were business administration, supervision of work under construction, and checking of shop drawings. Work on the Civic Arena, as well the aforementioned projects, &quot;was almost totally conceived, planned, and the details on them almost wholly determined&quot; by Mitchell.12 In the mid-1950s, Mitchell &amp; Ritchey employed a staff of fourteen, exclusive of associates. The partnership was terminated on August 30, 1957, under very difficult circumstances, but the architects&#39; work on the Civic Arena was nearly completed by that time.”</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Michalopoulos">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Michalopoulos</a></p>

<p>Born James Mitchell in Pittsburgh, 1951 - James Mitchell Jr.?  It&#39;s the right time and place.</p>

<p>And changed his name to Michalopoulos - back to his father&#39;s original Greek name?</p>

<p>Has Same Hyde said where he met the guy?  New Orleans maybe?</p>

<p>Maybe this is different son of the architect James Mitchell.</p>

<p>But he does use architecture as a subject for his paintings.</p>

<p>How about these modern art sculptures - he wanted to create 3D versions of his bizarre paintings of crooked and distorted architecture.  </p>

<p>Maybe he has some issues with architecture in general because of what happened to his father.</p>

<p>And now he does modern art, a subculture where millionaires pay ridiculous amounts for seemingly worthless lumps of metal.  A perfect money-laundering business to hide child trafficking, especially when we know how many of these artists are sick perverts whose only creativity is in thinking of new ways to be disgusting and evil.</p>

<p>So the father escaped the elite world of underground sex practices, but did the son?  Is he obsessed with his father&#39;s story because he made a different choice and now regrets it?  But he knows he owes his art-world success and summer home in France to a betrayal of his father&#39;s ideals?  He never wanted to suffer imposed failure like his father did, but he wishes he had his father&#39;s integrity?</p>

<p>Anyway this might not even be the same guy.  </p>
