        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>as the title says we have all seen the pictures of the globe from space. This is plenty of evidence for a well trained eye as mine to spot the CGI. But it&#39;s not enough for everyone many people still believe these pictures are actual photographs because they cannot recognize the inconsistency between real photographs and paintings. Also there is the fact that all the different globe pictures over the years and inconsistent with each other as well</p>

<p><a href="https://missiongalacticfreedom.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/nasa-fake-earth.jpg?w=678&amp;h=678">https://missiongalacticfreedom.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/nasa-fake-earth.jpg?w=678&amp;h=678</a></p>

<p>So the question is why can&#39;t we see a video now? We obviously (sarcasm) have the ability to take a picture of one side of the earth. Now why can&#39;t we record a video of it spinning? at the same quality as the picture. it should be child&#39;s play with all the satellites out there in space(sarcasm)</p>

<p>could it be because a video would be much harder to fake?? we have seen them try to fake videos like these before. If you care to post a link to one of the videos of the &quot;globe spinning&quot; Ill tell you why it&#39;s fake. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Part of the problem is many artistic renderings and composite images are implied to be single photographs when they&#39;re not. But, real ones do exist.</p>

<p>If you want a timelapse, you can get a new photo every few hours from <a href="https://epic.gsfc.nasa.gov/epic-galleries/2015/first_light/full/187_2015187190111.png">DSCOVR</a> since 2015.</p>

<p>For video (although not the whole thing at once), you might be interested in the live stream from ISS though, although you can only see the Earth when it&#39;s on the day side.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You don&#39;t see stars in this image for the same reason you don&#39;t see them during the day... the Earth lit up by sunlight is much brighter. An exposure time long enough to capture the stars would lead to the  image being washed out by the Earth&#39;s brightness. Try it sometime, take a picture at night with a streetlamp overhead and see if you can get the camera to show both at once clearly.</p>

<p>The &quot;pear shaped&quot; thing is a pedantic comment by Tyson. The actual difference in diameter between the Equator and the N-S pole is like 13 miles on a sphere almost 8,000 miles across. He&#39;s technically right, but even his tweet says &quot;slightly&quot;... as far as the human eye can tell, it&#39;s spherical.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here is a great one that shows exactly the effect I am talking about! You have the ISS looking at the night side, and you can see things on Earth as well as the stars.

<p>We just had had a whole exchange about camera exposure times, and why any exposure time short enough to catch the dayside of a moon/planet is too short to catch stars or city lights.</p>

<p>You can see the lights from 250 miles up on the night side. I doubt you can see them from 238,900 miles.</p>

<p>What you&#39;re really looking for are images from the star trackers on spacecraft that they use to orient themselves.

<p>Hayabusa used its star tracker to track an asteroid, there might be better versions of these images elsewhere.</p>

<p>And LISA Pathfinder returned an interesting image on its way out: a picture of the Earth&#39;s atmosphere at night and some stars.</p>

<p>Could be considered not worth it given how it&#39;s not the purpose of the mission, and the vast majority of people involved feel that the common model is overwhelmingly supported anyway. These images are worse than what good telescopes on Earth or in orbit dedicated to the purpose can capture. Every bit of downlink time spend senting useless star tracker images is time spent not downloading the data the mission is sent to collect.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>To do a proper time lapse of Mars like DSCOVR did for Earth, you would need a spacecraft in a synchronous orbit around it or a lagrane point, somewhere it could observe the whole planet. I don&#39;t believe there are any currently.</p>

<p>That said you can get time lapses from the rovers such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkiXlWRrqqo">this one</a>, and one that Hubble took of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2usjVPH29Js">Phobos orbiting</a> the planet, and  of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/09/28/science/space/mars-nasa-flowing-water.html">streaks of what we are pretty sure is water</a> on the surface taken from orbit.</p>

<p>Specifically looking for a wide angled shot with identifiable stars by the way - from outside Earth orbit past the moon or outside another planet preferably.</p>

<p>How about a time lapse of some stars as seen through Saturn&#39;s rings by Cassini? They were only incidentally captured in the image; like I&#39;ve said, the spacecraft isn&#39;t there to look at the stars. We have Earth orbiting/ground telescopes that can do that job much better.</p>

<p>Makes sense to me given you have to set your exposure time based on the planet you&#39;re looking at instead of the stars in the background. If Jupiter wasn&#39;t in the frame they could use a longer exposure and catch more of the stars. The atmosphere on Mars is also often dusty, even though it&#39;s thin.</p>

<p>Here, let&#39;s look at another night&#39;s worth of MASTCAM, this one doesn&#39;t seem to have a planet and so there are more stars:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They would be slightly different, but not to human perception I think. Alpha Centauri is 4.whatever light years away, Mars is like 400M km, something like 0.004% of the way there.

<p>If the stars were much closer, you could tell the difference. But given we can measure the distance of the stars with parallax, I don&#39;t think they&#39;re orders of magnitude closer than they are supposed to be.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You aren&#39;t making any sense here. Using calculations is not the same as <strong>observable</strong> evidence. If the observation doesn&#39;t fit the calculation the calculation is wrong.</p>

<p>Go look at the Mars orbiter pic yourself and map the stars. They do not line up. At the very least there are dozens of uncatalogued stars in the image. Which means:</p>

<p>The earlier claim that &quot;star tracking data has no scientific relevance&quot; is false.</p>

<p>If the rovers are analyzing star tracking data <a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/mro/mission/spacecraft/parts/gnc/sensors/">10 times every second</a>, how did Voyager do this without sending data back? Ah <a href="https://oce.jpl.nasa.gov/mib/VOY-1.pdf">it&#39;s star tracker only tracked a couple different stars</a> and it the module failed.</p>

<p>But modern craft have back ups.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Two star trackers provide full knowledge of the spacecraft&#39;s orientation....As is the case with many components aboard Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, the second star tracker is a backup in case the first one fails.</p>

<p>The star tracker is a very smart camera that <strong>takes a digital picture of the stars and then compares the image with those in its own catalog of thousands of stars to identify the stars in the image</strong>. Once it does that, it knows exactly where it was pointing when it took the picture, and it sends a message to the computer conveying that information. And, it does that 10 times every second!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is observational evidence and there is theory and models [simulations]. So far the only observable evidence produced suggests the stars are in different configuration at Mars. Did they design the star trackers to be all inclusive machine operating -  without sending data back - on purpose?</p>

<p>It sure did! The investigation reading was interesting. I&#39;m currently trying to debug some annoying electrical work and it makes me feel better about myself to know NASA has struggled with similar issues even on flagship missions.</p>

<p>Anyway, the failure only occurred on Voyager 1 and not 2 to my knowledge though.</p>

<p>We can keep info on thousands of stars on spacecraft these days because memory is cheap compared to the 70s, making the process much more reliable.</p>

<p>Are you suggesting star trackers don&#39;t work? If the position of stars changes so rapidly, they would all fail because they are based on apparently fixed stars. Yet Voyager 1 had this problem and not Voyager 2 or most future spacecraft. Why?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>At the very least there are dozens of uncatalogued stars in the image.</p>

<p>Or, artifacts, which is why the raw images are often cleaned up. You were the one who insisted on images <em>before</em> they&#39;ve been processed... which is why you might see junk that isn&#39;t really there. I think mostly all that flickr user did was add some labels which may well have been wrong; he&#39;s just some guy on the internet after all.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>By what mechanism do you suppose this happens? We have totally independent measurements (parallax being foremost among them) confirming the tremendous distance of the stars from Earth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No one claimed the stars aren&#39;t there. If they are in another position the trackers would work fine but they would need a more robust system with lots of computing power. Kinda like what exists on the Mars systems which analyze them 10x / second.</p>

<p>Never asked you to do homework. You made a claim you should provide proof for the claim. It should be easy to find a stellar image with each star location mapped in the open space program you claim to be a part of. </p>

<p>This is no different than mapping the local back woods [which if someone asked for the map there&#39;d be no problem giving it] or taking a picture of the night sky and listing the stars.</p>

<p>You posted a time lapse from heliocentric orbit? The clouds did not move. If moving through space is moving through time perhaps time is different relative to the other position in space. But to the observer it moves the same speed. </p>

<p>In other words an orbit on Mars is 1.9 years from Earths frame of reference - but on Mars it moves at the same speed but Earth relative to it is moving ???? [or perhaps not moving].</p>

<p>They do move, and you can see them move if you look closely, just not much on that scale. Weather patterns don&#39;t change entirely (I mean on the scale of continents) in only a few hours between images.</p>

<p>Ok, so in this view Mars and Earth appear to move at different rates depending on which one you&#39;re standing on?

<p>Careful wording there. They do though. If you watch global radar they move quite a lot in very short timeframes. In fact if you check the ISS data they monitor these changes as well. <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/experiments/1037.html">CATS NASA</a></p>

<p>So there is engineering and there is theoretical physics. Engineering doesn&#39;t give a shit about things are &quot;meant to work&quot; or how &quot;they are supposed to work&quot; - engineering only cares about &quot;how do we make this work&quot;.</p>

<p>This is extremely important because the people designing systems are not the people in the rooms coming up with the explanation as to why they work. Engineers in general focus on tangible data.</p>

<p>Given that NASA models various missions with Flat models, Heliocentric models, Geocentric models, etc.... - it means that for novel interpretation [aka - only relying on what we know] we do not care about previous explanations [though they may be useful in many aspects] we only care about observational data.</p>

<p>If we look back on previous attempts at explaining observational data and there are gaps in basic explanations [e.g. star mapping Mars celestial sphere] - this raises a lot of questions.</p>

<p><strong>Whether or not you can model observational data in a convoluted manner has no bearing on a simpler interpretation for it to be modelled.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see where your confusion is coming from. Mars&#39; sols are just under 40 minutes longer than Earth days. This is why NASA sometimes tries to have the teams working on Mars rovers live on &quot;Mars time&quot; adjusting their schedule appropriately each day. It&#39;s led to some amusing and maybe predictable results: <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/nasa-employees-almost-mutineed-over-living-on-mars-time-2013-1">people don&#39;t like changing their sleep period constantly</a>.</p>

<p>So let&#39;s figure out the effects of this!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>2017-06-26 09:19:04 UTC - Night</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If Mars and Earth days were the same duration, you would expect any image taken near the same time to be daylight. So at first your confusion with:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>2017-07-13 09:37:54 UTC - Day</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is understandable. It&#39;s less than 20 minutes later after all. Assuming it wasn&#39;t taken right before dawn, you might assume it would still be day. But let&#39;s factor in the difference between sols and days.</p>

<p>With each Earth day that passes, Mars is 40 minutes short of having passed a full sol. So 1 Earth day later, on 6-27 09:19:04 UTC, Mars&#39; rotation is now 40 minutes behind Earth. 1 more day later, on 6-28 09:19:04 UTC, Mars&#39; rotation is now 80 minutes behind Earth. That is, Earth has made two full rotations, while Mars is 80 minutes away from completing its second rotation. That means that if a chosen location on Mars and a chosen location on Earth happened to have the sun rise at the same time on 6-26, the same Mars location would see the sun rise 80 minutes later than you would expect on 6-28 using a clock from Earth.</p>

<p>Do this out for another 15 days and you&#39;re 17*40=680 minutes or 11 hours and 20 minutes behind. In other words, Earth has just completed it&#39;s 17th full rotation at 2017-07-13 09:19:04 UTC, but Mars has only completed 16 full rotations and is 11 hours and 20 minutes away from completing its 17th.</p>

<p>Hope that clears things up!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, the images will match the &quot;theoretical model&quot; of a heliocentric (ok, barycentric, but close enough) solar system with distant stars and so on. If you&#39;re talking specifically on the Mars day/night thing, it will match what &quot;Mars time&quot; and the Martian seasons are.</p>

<p>Experiments return one-off incorrect results all the time, the FTL neutrinos thing being just one recent, news-worthy example. This is why a cornerstone of science is repeatability and independent confirmation. Which incidentally is why I&#39;m glad there are multiple space programs and many independent astronomers across the world.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t forget that another cornerstone is actually proposing a new hypothesis and testable predictions if you think your observations differ from the stablished model. Would love to see some of those from you!</p>

<p>You are surely asking this as a lead in to claim one of these images has an incorrect or doctored time stamp, thus blowing the lid off a global conspiracy involving millions of people over the years.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Global conspiracy&quot; is such a loaded term. A false dilemma. If there is a simpler method of modelling the universe [or even a more complicated one which shows the current one is inaccurate] it would be easily concealed [or hindered] by controlling the data and access to raw data [even unintentionally]. Which is already apparent.</p>

<p>The data is controlled at the experiment level and at the distribution level.</p>

<p>Was there ever a record of 24 hour period on Mars that was photographed? That would be interesting. The shift work must be terrible because the team operating seems to work very strange hours. One week its 6AM-12PM UTC - next is 6PM-11PM UTC another is 1PM-5PM. So on and so forth. Yet there doesn&#39;t seem to be a 24 hr period where record was taken consecutively each hour.</p>

<p>Strange hours the rover team works. Strange if there isn&#39;t a 24 consecutive period. </p>

<p>How can you expect people to come up with new hypothesis if they don&#39;t have access to all the raw data, or what is &quot;omitted&quot; during experiments?</p>

<p>Logically speaking it does not make sense that there are missing gaps in the recorded data. No 24 hour period on Mars recorded [that can be found] - No star maps from the other planets - etc. (Many more like this) Sometimes the story is told by what&#39;s left out of it.</p>

<p>I get images from to on 00:53:36 on Jan 1st 2013 22:12:22 on Jan 3rd 2013.</p>

<p>Not all of these are in immediately viewable format (png jpg whatever) so you may need to download and process the raw data yourself.</p>

<p>If you are interested in the other data products (there are more instruments than just imagers) you can go to <a href="https://pds.nasa.gov/">https://pds.nasa.gov/</a> and search everything there.</p>

<p>If you find something interesting, be sure to publish on it. No doubt there is still a lot we can learn from the incredible wealth of data that&#39;s available!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Strange hours the rover team works.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The idea is to match their schedules to the actual schedule of the rover. I think it only drives during the day, for example, and they want the people controlling that part of the mission to be on duty then.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not the best plan in my opinion. I think they would be better served by working in stable shifts. But I can see where they are coming from.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Logically speaking it does not make sense that there are missing gaps in the recorded data.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When you say &quot;gap&quot; you make it sound like a missing piece of footage from a CCTV security system that otherwise records constantly. That would fit something like, when the ISS live stream goes down.</p>

<p>If I take one picture and then another at a later time, that&#39;s not a &quot;gap in the recorded data.&quot; I&#39;ve just recorded data at two different times.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that there are many instruments besides just the cameras, and not enough power to run them all at once constantly. When the rover is not taking pictures, it&#39;s doing other things. Often that includes returning the result of actions its taken and waiting for a response, since the round trip communications time can be many minutes depending on how far away Mars is at the time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Without having access to free flowing data [transparent experiments with no question to their legitimacy] its hard to envision a workable model. Ill give you a list of considerations:</p>

<p><a href="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/75/85/40/75854003fd699b010f5b2e286b50c93c.gif">This is what the celestial sphere looks like</a> so it should be relevant. Not sure how it can be incorporated but to think we see this at night and in basic experiments suggests to me it must be correlated some way.</p>

<p>Hawking&#39;s <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9a/World_line.png">&quot;Light Cone&quot;</a> is interesting. Toyed with the idea the solar system is on the hyper surface and the Sun and celestial sphere are opposing sides of the cone. </p>

<p>It&#39;s interesting to note that &quot;space&quot; could be seen as expanding by temperature. Any experiment will create pressure with heat. Pressure could be defined as the amount of &quot;free space&quot; in the system growing. If so the sun would seem to be creating space and &#39;space&#39; [2.4K] would be immensely dense. Anywhere you find hot plasma [ionized] clouds would be an increase in space. Meaning &#39;space&#39; would be like a fractal vortex [think like the atomic force microscope which just keeps bringing up new landscape]. Relative to pressure differentials that limit each system. Really it&#39;s the ultimate &#39;relativity&#39;.</p>

<p>&quot;Space&quot; or its fabric would be envisioned as flat. <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/thumbnails/image/pia21260.jpg">This image</a> and others like it - where you only see half a planet - it would be on a 2d plane [explains the ecliptic - not sure it can be explained without]. Toyed with the idea mushroom shaped planets curve in on themselves. The backside on the underside of the bright half. But if the Saturn pictures are correct then it kills this [I think] - since the rings appear in 3d space. <a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-CBJXjI-sIVs/UwM8VGDF8qI/AAAAAAAAC5E/gBSx7YRX_lw/s1600/saturn+aurora.jpg">Notice how it looks like a drain plug though?</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWdKVpQ94Ns">Fluid dynamics</a> would explain baryonic orbits. Still hazard to guess there is an electromagnetic interaction.</p>

<p>Some days the sun sets and stars are immediately visible, other days the sky is baron for a very long time until all light is gone. This discrepancy would be able to be calculated if [heat/radiation = increased space] its accurate. [no claims made just visualizing the idea]. Essentially the sun is changing the amount of &quot;space&quot; and the stars would be distorted or perhaps not even behind it [hard to explain - think like a bubble inside a bubble] - <a href="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/gif/2015/05/exploding_sun_2.gif">the sun is creating more space</a> which envelops the planets its touching [with radiation]</p>

<p>This leads us to the Ozone layer and the plasma problem. 99.9% of the observable universe is plasma. Ignoring so called &quot;dark matter&quot; the missing 97%.</p>

<p>The Ionosphere is ionized gas. Basically plasma. The Ozone-Oxygen cycle cannot work as described when we apply experimental evidence to it. There&#39;s no experimental proof Ozone can be created simply from UV light but thats in the model. In fact, Ozone needs either a photocatalytic substrate [Tio2] or it needs an electromagnetic field - electricity - which is exactly why we smell it after lightning storms. <a href="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/gif/2015/05/exploding_sun_2.gif">Experimental work</a> shows that a UV laser frees Oxygen from Co2. If it also creates o3 it should be present in the same experiment. But chemistry doesn&#39;t have many reactions where adding more of the same thing causes a novel reaction. So (based on experimental data) either there is a catalyst substrate in the Karmin Line [a dome - FE&#39;ers would love this] or the Ozone creation is likely directly related to the electromagnetic field - which makes sense because the Karmin Line is right where the Ionosphere begins. </p>

<p>The Ozone-Oxygen paradox leads me to visualize leaning towards an electromagnetic interpretation but that doesn&#39;t explain matter. Perhaps just really slow moving plasma going down the Vortex drain. No idea.</p>

<p>Whatever model is used as a fundamental understanding of our environment &amp; space - it should really take into account all of these observations. The plasma reality is one of the hardest to incorporate. Plasma requires electrical input. Period. Planets and Suns have magnetic fields. The universe seems to be a giant dynamo or electric machine. But then we don&#39;t see ourselves as plasma - so matter needs to come into the equation. </p>

<p>Maybe the machine makes the matter that we see on our plane of the solar system where the dynamo is spinning and spitting out planets. If the observer were in any other position [another star] the Earth would then be a ball of plasma to them - different time frames [this requires the time-frame point I was making earlier]. Essentially nothing would exist in Earth&#39;s time frame except Earth and whatever is on the solar plane.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not so much that this isn&#39;t being investigated or considered or experimented on - just that its all done in very compartmentalized fashion [in the public sphere] so the public is left to take interpretations of complex math based on modelling based on mathematical models that were used to interpret data. Math is language - ruled by numerical logic. Vocabulary is language - ruled by philosophical logic. Both can be applied incorrectly or convoluted. Observation is needed to support either - which are simply visualizations of the mind.</p>

<p>There are a number of experiments that seem to indicate underlying natures of reality but they&#39;re done simply focused on that subject - or at least published with narrow focus.</p>

<p>Very happy simply not knowing but free to consider the possibilities. There must be an easily explainable answer. Occams Razor.</p>

<p>[transparent experiments with no question to their legitimacy] </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nothing wrong with questioning everything, but what sort of transparency are you looking for exactly? You can get countless gigabytes of results from numerous missions updated constantly. Surely these experiments are more transparent than the vast majority of papers often published without their dataset in other fields.</p>

<p>Is there <em>any</em> mission whose results you consider legitimate? Not limited to just NASA here: Roscosmos, ESA, ISRO, and so on too.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the Sun and celestial sphere are opposing sides of the cone.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If I&#39;m understanding you correctly, the eclipse will be a great time for you if you can get to the path of totality. The stars should appear even though the Sun will still be overhead. Being opposite cones from a hypersurface doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re physically on opposite sides of the earth, but it should still be interesting to check for you right? What is your prediction for what will happen?</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m sure you are aware of the more widely accepted model for this: temperature is proportional to the kinetic energy of the molecules in a substance. Then pressure is felt from those molecules bouncing off the container with more momentum than they had earlier. In a vacuum temperature doesn&#39;t have as much meaning (background radiation and occasional particle aside). If heat is a property of just space and not substance, why is heat carried by molecules (convection, conduction) as well as radiation?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>You can view Saturn yourself easily, so I&#39;d say yes it definitely does kill that. If the pictures weren&#39;t correct then millions of backyard astronomers would have noticed. A 100x telescope is cheap and you will be able to make out the rings, though depending on how sharp your eyes are you might have a hard time distinguishing them from the planet. Something like 150x is better.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[explains the ecliptic - not sure it can be explained without]</p>

<p>The planets don&#39;t orbit in the ecliptic exactly though. Pluto (which is still a planet in my heart) is the worst offender, but even Earth&#39;s own moon orbits <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit_of_the_Moon">somewhat off of it</a>. That&#39;s the reason eclipses aren&#39;t way more common than they are.</p>

<p>How far &quot;above&quot; or &quot;below&quot; the plane do you have to go for this to be noticeable?

<p>Voyager-1 is at an ecliptic latitude of 34.9 degrees, which at its current distance (about 139 AU from Earth) means it should be over 79 AU &quot;vertically&quot; out of the Earth&#39;s plane... yet we still talk to it (with the expected light delay). Is it outside our time frame yet?</p>

<p>Actually very mundane stuff. Mostly recorded data that isn&#39;t built on theoretical modelling. Already aware they engineer for what works - but when its put into papers or data is presented it almost always cites back other theory, or limits observations a priori. </p>

<p>Are you aware of the &quot;massive pressure event&quot; on Pluto? There was a video floating around from a NASA conference but haven&#39;t been able to find it since. Recorded ~1 bar pressure. [Funny NASA doesn&#39;t use an SI standard - they listed it in exponential millibars - when it could easily been presented as the truly remarkable find it (supposedly) was.]</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Is there any mission whose results you consider legitimate?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Only know what can be tested,  or for some experiments they are straight forward enough they do not raise questions. In a defence industry [space was born out of defence - history - NASA had a DoD mandate in its inception] that classifies millions of documents a year, trillions in spending - no, unless there was a widespread transparency/disclosure effort that released ~80 years worth of data.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Being opposite cones from a hypersurface doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re physically on opposite sides of the earth </p>

<p>Have you been somewhere on the Earth where night and day are not opposite? Think of the sides of the cone not having any actual &quot;space&quot; next to them. Imagine the cones at a very massive scale, Earth would be where both meet.</p>

<p>As for the ecliptic - <a href="http://www.pitt.edu/%7Ejdnorton/teaching/HPS_0410/chapters/spacetime/light_cone_elsewhere.png">you can visualize it like this as well</a></p>

<p>All ozone generators use a Pigmented substrate or they simply create ozone by electrical field. Debated this already with someone on here - my position is sound. (Admittedly make mistakes sometimes but fairly confident on this one)</p>

<p>I believe we are headed straight for the notion that all of these missions are faked, right? &quot;Claimed to be used&quot; and all that.</p>

<p>We have already talked about the moonbounce any amateur radio operators can do with reasonably accessible equipment ($thousands, but not $tens of thousands). That is a way to measure the distance to the Moon that is independent of the speed of light.</p>

<p>Doesn&#39;t matter whether space is a vacuum or liquid nitrogen or plasma or whatever else you want it to be. If the speed of light changes it might take longer to get where it&#39;s going, but still travel the same distance there and back, and in the process cover a certain distance across Earth between its transmitted and reflected/received points. Unless it takes so long that the Earth rotates underneath it, but the moon bounce only takes a couple seconds. Don&#39;t take my word for it, ask the countless amateur radio operators who have done it.</p>

<p>So you&#39;ve measured the distance to the moon, and you also know how long the signal took to get there and back again. Then its easy to find c asy you can imagine. It might be a little off depending on any latencies you have anywhere else processing or whatnot.</p>

<p>Once you know the speed of light in space, you can then use that speed to find the distance to planets that have probes at them, by how long the signals take to reach you.</p>

<p>Unless all the probes are fake, of course.</p>

<p>Ozone generators that use electric fields (corona discharge) also exist but they are a separate thing. In fact they work well under different conditions: UV generators are better suited to work in humid air than corona discharge generators. Yet over time, they &quot;<a href="https://uvsystems.com/faq/solarization-rates">solarize</a>&quot; producing less UV light. When this occurs, they also produce less ozone. Why is this, if UV generators are just creating ozone by way of an electric field anyway?</p>

<p>Here is another paper: Production, Concentration, and Decomposition of Ozone by Ultraviolet Lamps: <a href="http://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.1714828?journalCode=jap">http://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.1714828?journalCode=jap</a></p>

<p>Why does this occur from an ultraviolet lamp and not so much for a visible light fluorescent, if it&#39;s just the electric field that matters? The only difference between them is a different phosphor on the tube that emits UV instead of visible light.</p>

<p>Let me guess: this paper is fake or the researchers are wrong? You&#39;ve asked for experimental evidence, but I have a feeling you will dismiss any that is provided as fake or incorrect without explanation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I want to make sure I understand your contentions here:</p>

<p>1) UV ozone generators produce ozone, but they don&#39;t do it because of the UV radiation itself, rather because of an electrical field.</p>

<p>2) Other fluorescent lamps don&#39;t produce ozone (I don&#39;t think you disagreed with this) because...?</p>

<p>3) Everyone who thinks otherwise is wrong, either deliberately or unknowingly.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Nor could it be because the in actual physics there needs to be a barrier or containment field presenting a gas from bleeding into a vacuum.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Containment field... like gravity? The reason Earth retains an atmosphere to begin with? Gases do escape gradually though, especially lighter ones (hydrogen, helium). Earth having a magnetic field helps; not having one is part of why Mars has only wisps of an atmosphere left.</p>

<p>Anyway, the air gets thinner as you go up, this is why pilots and mountain climbers need to bring gas with them to breathe past a certain altitude. If there is indeed a super dense fluid instead of a vacuum in space, why is there a low pressure region in between the dense part of our atmosphere and that?</p>

<p>Curious...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sending a UV wavelength through a vacuum into o2 and creating ozone has never been reproduced.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This has been done repeatedly.</p>

<p><a href="https://inis.iaea.org/search/search.aspx?orig_q=RN:46052989">https://inis.iaea.org/search/search.aspx?orig_q=RN:46052989</a></p>

<p>Experiments like the above paper are done in a vacuum chamber.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a169024.pdf">http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a169024.pdf</a></p>

<p>Vacuum chambers themselves can be cleaned by putting a UV lamp inside and allowing a tiny amount (10<sup>-4</sup> Torr) of oxygen in, which is converted to ozone and helps disinfect the surfaces.</p>

<p>Of course all of these experiments are fake, or wrong.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh how did I know the &#39;experiment&#39; would involve a quartz tube?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>quartz tube nozzle</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There seems to be a backwards causality in these experiments. From <a href="http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a169024.pdf">this paper</a></p>

<p>Quartz wavelength - 184.9nm / 253.7nm / &lt;300nm</p>

<p>Silica and glass do not produce 184 - and glass doesn&#39;t produce 253.</p>

<p>Whats the wavelength of the plasmas before they hit the glass? How do you ignore the glass itself in the causal chain? Especially when changing it removes the effect. It&#39;s absurd.</p>

<p>If you apply the same effect to the Ozone layer again we have a glass dome overhead.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Anyway, the air gets thinner as you go up, this is why pilots and mountain climbers need to bring gas with them to breathe past a certain altitude. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>False. They do so because its low pressure [the air is the same]. There&#39;s not enough pressure mediation allowing the lung to absorb air. The lungs work by pressure mediation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If there is indeed a super dense fluid instead of a vacuum in space, why is there a low pressure region in between the dense part of our atmosphere and that? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The IACO Standard seems to be theoretical. SR 71 used to melt in high atmosphere - supposedly a low pressure, low temperature, low density environment. </p>

<p>Does that make sense?</p>

<p>I&#39;ve only seen one high altitude density experiment done on Everest and it didn&#39;t meet the predictive model. </p>

<p>But you seem to be confusing density and pressure. All experiments on Earth correlate higher temperature with lower density, low temperature with high density. While there is a variance to this the relative position [of pressure] lower temperatures always coincide with higher density.</p>

<p>In the discussion about observing the transmissions to space craft in relation to their internal frame I noted how beneficial that data is. Yet you messed up and said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If the speed of light changes it might take longer to get where it&#39;s going, but still travel the same distance there and back.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If distance is unchanging how does gravity affect &quot;space-time&quot;? If the speed of light is constant it means density is thus a measure of distance [which changes] relative to light.</p>

<p>Also if you use the time of light travel to calculate distance but that itself is variable what does that say about the calculated distance?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Of course all of these experiments are fake, or wrong.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Never said that. Its more the interpretation is wrong. Unless you believe mankind has never been wrong before or used an interpretation that wasn&#39;t the easiest or delivered the most <em>comprehension</em> on a given subject.</p>

<p>They don&#39;t <em>produce</em> anything, they are opaque or transparent to certain wavelengths. You don&#39;t need a quartz dome to <em>create</em> 184.9 uv light from the sun&#39;s rays, you would need a glass dome to <em>stop</em> that wavelength.</p>

<p>How are you proposing ozone is produced from trace oxygen in a vacuum chamber when a UV lamp is turned on inside?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They do so because its low pressure [the air is the same]</p>

<p>You are saying that the density of air is the same at higher altitudes? Why then do balloons have a maximum altitude related to the density of what&#39;s inside them?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>lower temperatures always coincide with higher density.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sort of. It depends on what variables you fix in the gas law.</p>

<p>PV=nRT</p>

<p>Yes it&#39;s an approximation, just an easy way to see what I mean:</p>

<p>If there&#39;s less stuff (mols) present, you can have low temperature, density, and pressure even though decreasing the temperature might make a higher density than it would have otherwise. In other words, <em>low</em> and <em>higher</em> are not exclusive. Example: increase temperature from -15 C to -10 C, the temperature has increased but a person outside might still say it&#39;s very cold/low.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If distance is unchanging how does gravity affect &quot;space-time&quot;? If the speed of light is constant it means density is thus a measure of distance [which changes] relative to light.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The effect depends on the body you&#39;re talking about. The Moon barely bends light at all compared to something like a black hole. For the purpose of this exercise you can neglect the effect completely, but we can <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_lensing_formalism">work it out</a> if you really want to.</p>

<p>The effect of the Moon&#39;s somewhat elliptical orbit matters more than the gravitational lensing effect.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also if you use the time of light travel to calculate distance but that itself is variable what does that say about the calculated distance?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My entire point is that you <em>don&#39;t</em> use the time of light travel to calculate distance. You use the distance and the time of light travel to find c. Or if you prefer, the <em>average</em> of c over the distance since it will be slightly different in air versus in a vacuum.</p>

<p>Draw a triangle from point A on Earth (transmitter) to point B on the Moon, then back down to another point C on Earth (receiver).</p>

<p>You start off knowing the straight line distance between A and C, which is a chord through the Earth. Depending on the distance it might not go far beneath the surface, in which case you can approximate the Earth as flat if you want.</p>

<p>You then work out the angles A and C that the antenna had to elevate from that chord to point at the Moon. So now you have a triangle of which you know two angles and one side. Obviously you can find the angle B needed for A+B+C=180 degrees.</p>

<p>You can from this work out the length of the other two sides. Call their combined round trip distance D.</p>

<p>We can also double check the distance to the moon in other ways, like <a href="https://www.universetoday.com/91120/do-it-yourself-guide-to-measuring-the-moons-distance/">using a lunar eclipse</a>.</p>

<p>Anyway:</p>

<p>(average)c=D/t. If the lunar distance is what we&#39;ve found above, and the intervening distance is filled with something that massively slows light down, the travel time should be much longer. But it&#39;s not. It&#39;s only a few seconds round trip.</p>

<p>This is the opposite of using c to find the distance to the Moon.</p>

<p>But you can run the calculation the other way, by first getting the value of c in some other measurement. Incidentally it agrees with the value from moon bounce experiments... curious coincidence? Then we can estimate the distance to the moon based on the travel time and speed.</p>

<p>So you can find the distance to the moon first and then work out the speed of light from the travel time. Or if you find the speed of light (some other way) first then measure the travel time to the moon, you can compute a distance to the moon. These numbers agree with each other.</p>

<p>I suppose the range finding experiments for the moon are entirely useless then. As well as all red-shift calculated distances.</p>

<p>Heat up a can of spray paint in the fire. Temperature increased, so did pressure. Were any &quot;mols&quot; added? No. </p>

<p>Density could be modelled measure of space within the system. If you heat &quot;molecules&quot; they are said to be excited, but even in that model they then occupying different frames - expanded - meaning there is more &quot;space&quot; in the system. Definition of &quot;space&quot; expanding. And its all causally linked to temperature.</p>

<p>Two mediums different densities - same observable space. 1cm3 of metal for instance, speed of sound travels different rates through different types. Just as light does in gas or liquid.</p>

<p>They occupy the same observable &quot;space&quot; yet could be said to have more or less &quot;space&quot; inside them.</p>

<p>Just as light travels different speeds in various mediums. If you say light speed is constant, speed of sound should be as well - it&#39;s no different. Neither can be measured in a <strong>true</strong> vacuum. Sound for obvious reasons - light because a true vacuum doesn&#39;t exist.</p>

<p>This is what relativity implies. If light is a constant then it travels at that constant. In dense mediums it observably slows down meaning it travelled the same speed but the actual &quot;space&quot; it travelled increased [within the system or medium]. </p>

<p>There should really be a disclaimer for relativity.</p>

<p>Do you disagree with the method I showed? At the end I talk about how it works both ways: either use the speed of light (if you have it from some other measurement) for range finding, or use to find the speed of light.</p>

<p>So finding the distance of the moon can be done with or without taking a value for the speed of light ahead of time.</p>

<p>Then once you have a value for c (either because you found it from the moon distance+travel time or you already had a value and used it) you can use it for other purposes, red shift included.</p>

<p>Exactly...</p>

<p>PV=nRT</p>

<p>V is fixed (can has a constant volume, ignoring that the metal might deflect slightly before it bursts). n is fixed (no more molecules added). R is fixed (gas constant). Increase T, P increases.</p>

<p>But density stayed the same, because there is still the same amount of mass in the same volume.</p>

<p>Circular argument. If its travelling in a medium the speed of light changes. Also for &quot;gravitational lensing&quot; a notion that cannot be experimented with - we see the same observable effect on Earth with refraction of light. This is governed by the density of the medium it passes. </p>

<p>Density thus can be seen as &quot;gravitational lensing&quot;. Curious if you accounted for any plasma or gas clouds in space when calculating gravitational lensing. If you do not account for something like this it ignores basic observable phenomena.</p>

<p>How is it circular?</p>

<p>Let&#39;s start with the first part:</p>

<p>Do you agree with the method I outlined for finding the distance of the Moon from the Earth (<em>without</em> first having the speed of light)?</p>

<p>If you do, then you can find the speed of light from the travel time and distance traveled.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can find the speed of light in some other way first. Then, <em>without</em> doing the trig distance calculation, you can find the distance of the .</p>

<p>That&#39;s not circular. Circular would be:</p>

<p>(calculate d to the moon based on t and c)--&gt;(calculate c based on d and t)--&gt;(repeat)</p>

<p>What I&#39;m saying is you can do:</p>

<p>(calculate d to the moon WITHOUT c, and measure t)--&gt;(calculate c based on d and t)</p>

<p>OR</p>

<p>(measure t, and have a value of c you already found through some totally different experiment)--&gt;(calculate d from t and c)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a circular reasoning for two correlating calculations. Correlation is not causation but causation <em>must</em> correlate. Which means you cannot leave out any causative function.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the whole Erastothenes argument about the size of the Earth. It would work <a href="http://www.millersville.edu/physics/experiments/058/flatrth.GIF">both ways</a>. Not saying the Earth is flat but you get the idea. </p>

<p>The best way to prove something is attempting to falsify it. <a href="http://www.ast.cam.ac.uk/%7Ederkal/files/public_talks/ancient_greek_astronomy.pdf">The moons distance was calculated numerous times using geometry with varying results</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>To make things more concise I&#39;m going to refer to experiments #1 and #2 for short:</p>

<p>1) Find d to moon using geometry, find c from d and round trip t.</p>

<p>2) Assume c based on some other experiment, find d from c and round trip t.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It also ignores the mediums surrounding it. Light travels different in those mediums.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This only affects the result of experiment #2, which I will agree you can dispute if you say the light travels at a different speed in some medium in space you aren&#39;t aware of (so you assume it&#39;s a vacuum by mistake).</p>

<p>In that case, at what altitude does the not-vacuum start? I think you said it was something that slowed light down to 17 m/s (correct me if I misremember). Since round trip to the moon is on the order of a couple seconds in these experiments, the Moon must be right in the beginning of that medium in your model.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Not sure about the geometric calculation either since Bolivia to Cleveland is 6686km away from each other but the angle of the Moon is 25 and 30 degrees [respectively].</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ok so this one is for experiment #1.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure where you got those angles from. They will vary by the time of day and you are forgetting about azimuth. This whole thing is way, way easier to calculate if you pick two places that are the same longitude. The reason is that if they&#39;re not, you need to consider the effect of azimuth as well as elevation. When they&#39;re at the same longitude, and the moon is highest, then one looks ~N and one looks ~S above the horizon to see it. This makes the math much easier.</p>

<p>Then it will look like this <a href="http://imgur.com/a/Ae8D0">mspaint diagram</a> that isn&#39;t to scale but I hope gets the idea across.</p>

<p>I&#39;m going to use similar latitude to what you already gave, but change the longitude to be the same: Point A: 45 N 80 W and point B: 16 S 80 W.</p>

<p><a href="http://aa.usno.navy.mil/cgi-bin/aa_altazw.pl?form=2&amp;amp;body=10&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=8&amp;amp;day=11&amp;amp;intv_mag=10&amp;amp;place=&amp;amp;lon_sign=-1&amp;amp;lon_deg=80&amp;amp;lon_min=&amp;amp;lat_sign=1&amp;amp;lat_deg=45&amp;amp;lat_min=&amp;amp;tz=4&amp;amp;tz_sign=-1">Moon elevation from point A</a></p>

<p>Moon is at its height at 13:20 in both places. 60 deg and 58.9 deg respectively.</p>

<p>In order to draw the triangle correctly we also have to account for the angle from the chord between the two points, not from the horizon. See what I mean in the same <a href="http://imgur.com/a/Ae8D0">mspaint diagram</a>. If we just measured the elevation of the Moon from the horizon (i.e. from a tangent line to the circle) we would be leaving out part of the real angle of the triangle.</p>

<p>To account for this, we add half the great circle angle between them at each point. So imagine, since they are 61 deg latitude difference, someone at point A would have to drill into the Earth at an angle 30.5 deg to the horizon to reach point B. So the elevation of the moon <em>from that tunnel</em> is 30.5 deg greater than it is from the horizon.</p>

<p>The great circle angle between them is 61 deg, so add half that to each elevation:</p>

<p>90.5 deg at point A, 89.4 deg at point B.</p>

<p>I get 3830587.718 for one side and 3830651.898 for the other. Both well within the range of the Moon&#39;s distance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You still haven&#39;t told me if you disagree with anything about the previous example.</p>

<hr/>

<p>I think you made a mistake here; I almost made it too. When I clicked to set lat/long and changed from -84.2672 to +84.2672 it changed successfully but it also changed the time zone (why, I don&#39;t know).</p>

<p><a href="https://www.mooncalc.org/#/84.2672,-99.1406,0/2017.08.11/05:19/1/0">Compare the time stamp (05:19 UTC-5)</a> with the time stamp on your link (05:19 UTC+0).</p>

<p>The moon is 2.96 deg elevation at the north point at 05:19 UTC-5, and 4.86 deg elevation at the south point at 05:19 UTC... but this is not the same time.</p>

<p>So I adjusted to 00:19 UTC-5 (which is 05:19 UTC, not sure why it won&#39;t let me change the time zone) and found that the moon was barely not visible (-0.35 deg).</p>

<hr/>

<p>I found a time when the moon is visible from a similar pair of locations. <a href="https://www.mooncalc.org/#/80.2667,-99.1333,0/2017.08.12/05:18/1/0">Here</a> and <a href="https://www.mooncalc.org/#/-80.2667,-99.1333,0/2017.08.12/10:18/1/0">here</a>. Note the time stamps being 5 hours different with a time zone difference of 5 hours... checks out.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll start with the chord length. I get 12678.26 km between the two points: 80 deg 16 min N to 80 deg 16 min.</p>

<p>We see an apparent elevation of 6.41 deg at the south point and 11.37 deg at the north point.</p>

<p>When the moon is this close to the horizon we need to take into account atmospheric refraction.</p>

<p>I think a flat earther might disbelieve in atmospheric refraction, but you&#39;re not one. The effect of atmospheric refraction has been determined through observation of stars. As stars are moving overhead they seem to move at a constant angular rate. Yet as they approach the horizon they seem to slow down slightly. This is because as they approach the horizon the effect of atmospheric refraction is increasing. The amount of refraction matches what we expect from the refractive index of air (varies with temperature, but negligibly for our purposes), which has also been empirically determined.</p>

<p>Anyway here is a table of values we can use:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.jhuapl.edu/techdigest/td/td1703/thomas.pdf">http://www.jhuapl.edu/techdigest/td/td1703/thomas.pdf</a></p>

<p>Table on p. 282 (p. 4 in the pdf).</p>

<p>Refraction at 7 deg apparent inclination is 7.4 min, and refraction at 11 deg apparent inclination is 4.9 min.</p>

<p>Our actual inclinations are slightly different but I&#39;ll use these values as an approximation for now. We get an adjusted (&quot;true&quot;) inclination of 6.286666667 deg and 11.28833333 deg.</p>

<p>Results:</p>

<p>If I use the apparent inclinations, I get a value of 425956.9049 and 426500.3817 for the triangle sides. This is about 12% too long to be the 379106 km value the webpage gives for the distance of the moon at this instance.</p>

<p>When we use the inclinations corrected for refraction, we get 376660.6721 and 376110.6083 km for the side lengths. This is very close, within 1% of the 379106 km value the webpage gives.</p>

<p>And I didn&#39;t even bother interpolating the refraction adjustments! If I do that, the approximation gets even better, to within 0.04%! Very nice.</p>

<p>In any case, it&#39;s certainly not 3000-4000 km!</p>

<p>Here is the calculation done after the first-order refraction correction (but before I did interpolation to make it even better):</p>

<p>Side AC: Chord length from North to South viewing sites. 12558.58 km.</p>

<p>Angle A: South point inclination (6.268333 deg)+80.26666667 deg (80.26... is half the great circle angle between 80 deg 16&#39; North and South, same procedure as before.)=86.535 deg</p>

<p>Angle C: North point inclination (11.28333 deg)+80.26666667 deg (80.26... is half the great circle angle between 80 deg 16&#39; North and South, same procedure as before.)=91.555 deg</p>

<p>Angle B: Triangle must be 180 degrees, so C=180-91.555-86.535=1.91 deg</p>

<p>We want to find sides AB and BC.</p>

<p>AB/sin(C)=AC/sin(B)</p>

<p>Solve for AB:</p>

<p>AB=sin(C)*AC/sin(B)</p>

<p>Plug in the values from above. sin(91.555 deg)*(12558.58 km)/sin(1.91 deg)=376660.6721.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I refer you to my <a href="http://imgur.com/14qhTBp">diagram from before</a>. How do you measure the two angles in that triangle that are on Earth?</p>

<p>Surely you see how the elevation from the horizon (the horizon being tangent to the circle) isn&#39;t the whole angle.</p>

<p>If two observers were exactly at the poles, they are 180 degrees apart from each other on the circle. What direction would they have to turn to look at each other through the Earth? They would have to look straight down, that is, 90 deg declination from the horizon, into the ground. 90=180/2. This is obvious right?</p>

<p>They start walking towards each other. Eventually they will meet at the equator and be able to look straight at each other (looking at the horizon 0 deg). In between, the angle they need to look down to point at each other is the same as each of their latitude, and half the difference in latitudes.</p>

<p>Move them to 45 deg latitude N/S. Now they are 90 degrees apart from each other on the circle. What direction do they have to turn to look at each other through the Earth? They each need to look 45 degrees down from the horizon. 45=90/2. Draw it yourself if you don&#39;t believe me.</p>

<p>Same story when they are at 80 deg N/S. Now they are 160 degrees apart from each other on the circle. What direction do they have to tun to look at each other through the Earth? They each need to look 80 degrees down from the horizon. 80=160/2. Draw it yourself if you don&#39;t believe me.</p>

<p>A model of it being other shapes work as well. So Im not sure what its supposed to prove.</p>

<p>This model wasn&#39;t used before the lunar distance was learned. It was learned in Project Diana [classified] and another project [classified] and shortly after the range-reflectors were put on the moon.</p>

<p>If you want to link the original [classified] experiments on how they came to their conclusions it would be of some actual benefit.

<p>You never read about the distance before learning this method of calculation - When was it conceived? They use geometry to guess the distance of the moon for thousands of years - with observations. It wasn&#39;t until the classified experiments by the Navy did a incontestable narrative come out about the distance.</p>

<p>For one - the model <strong>shouldn&#39;t work</strong>, because <a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/xzRAvJPmxCM7K/giphy.gif">Earth is shaped like this</a>. Pick two times in Kansas and do the equation, since its flatter than a pancake.</p>

<p>Also <a href="http://help.autodesk.com/cloudhelp/2016/ENU/Civil3D-UserGuide/images/GUID-CD6ABD9D-184C-4D03-BE26-7BA385062992.png">notice something here</a>. See how the curvature falls away from the horizon line. It doesn&#39;t do so on Earth. <strong>The curvature rises to eye level</strong>.</p>

<p>What does that have to do with it? If someone tells me something is 3&#39; long and then I measure it with a yardstick, the measurement isn&#39;t invalidated because I was told what it would be ahead of time.</p>

<p>We don&#39;t use the lunar distance as an input into our calculations... only the <em>observations</em> of the moon&#39;s angle combined with grade school geometry and the shape of the Earth.</p>

<p>So I&#39;ll ask real specific here: supposing that the Earth is convex-spherical, do you agree with the calculation? In other words, your only argument against this result is &quot;the earth is a different shape than you think&quot; right?</p>

<p>And if you do think the Earth is a different shape, please do the  math on how you compute the moon&#39;s distance in your model as I have done for mine.</p>

<p>This is not a depiction of the Earth&#39;s actual shape, it&#39;s a depiction of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoid">Geoid</a> and it even says so <em>on the picture</em>.

<p>No.</p>

<p>And even if it did, why can&#39;t you see more of the Earth&#39;s surface curving &quot;up&quot; above the horizon? Even with binoculars or a telescope? Yet you can see things such as tall buildings jutting up over the horizon.</p>

<p>But you already had the lunar distance you believe is correct. Why are the dozens or hundreds of other calculations using geometry incorrect? Eratosthenes did his own calculations. If he accurately predicted the size of the Earth why are his other calculations not valid?</p>

<p>Meant to say &quot;horizon&quot;. Yes it does. Level a camera and take a picture. Where is the horizon? &quot;eye level&quot; is not entirely accurate, it rises with increase in level or eye level.</p>

<p>Perspective, vanishing points and atmospheric refraction. The mainline arguments people bring up explaining loopy physics with the convex model. Except they are incorrect.</p>

<p>You still haven&#39;t posted the original classified work calculating the distance. Are you suggesting experiment design cannot be made to get intended results? There&#39;s a reason much of that information is still classified.</p>

<p>How is pressure and temperature not an absolute marker of how much <a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yoYJQ.png">&quot;space&quot; is in a system</a></p>

<p>The density thing was a misnomer. Since there&#39;s various meanings behind &quot;density&quot; - like apparent density and particle density. If you visualize everything being attached to a substrate or &#39;aether&#39; it starts getting confusing. Just stick with pressure and temperature since its a better marker.

<p>Lower temperature = less space. Not sure how this is hard to grasp or controversial when its basic flight mechanics. What happens in the upper atmosphere gets tricky because its based off <strong>hypothetical</strong> calculations. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a little irrelevant because the shape of the Earth changes the distances and everything else about the Moon. And yes it can be modelled multiple ways.</p>

<p>That&#39;s the point of fleshing out the falsifying observations first. Because if the model is wrong everything is wrong.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I provided the claimed model with photographic/observable evidence contradicting it. It&#39;s not built on any assumption of the moons distance. Since I cannot observe the moons distance I cannot verify its correct. You can fly in any plane or look at the hundreds [thousands - hundreds of thousands?] of picture as well as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwimocU0IIc">this video of a weather balloon high altitude</a> which can be used to observe the physics Im speaking about. It&#39;s painfully simple.</p>

<p>I&#39;m going to try to ask this very clearly:</p>

<p>1) Assuming the Earth is spherical as described, you agree the lunar distance checks out according to those observations, right?</p>

<p>2) You say it can be modeled multiple ways--model it a different way. Describe the shape of the Earth and then work through the geometry of where the moon is according to the observations of it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Does the angle of horizon change as altitude is increased? Yes or no? [it should - basic geometry says it should] How has this not been measured properly in a repeatable experiment? The fact you don&#39;t have an experiment to easily prove this wrong is very telling. Also why flat earthers have a point [not that the Earth is flat but that there is a major problem in the models claimed]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have proposed one for you to try. Why don&#39;t you do it? If I do you won&#39;t  believe me anyway. Measure the horizon with an inclinometer at sea level and then do it again at a great height.</p>

<p>All of the outer planets meet up perfectly with their position in the night sky relative to a complete circuit of the celestial sphere. What&#39;s <strong><em>really</em></strong> interesting though is that every few years or so the trip is <em>extended</em> by 40 days for Mercury, <em>decreased</em> by 100 days for Venus, decreased 200 days for Mars. As well as 200 day variations in Jupiter and Mars though the variations are smaller in comparison to the very long duration. Hence the &quot;~&quot; being used.</p>

<p>Those missing days are very telling. If the solar system model is correct and this accurately predicts the years of planetary orbits than why are there missing days from their motion?</p>

<p>Absolutely not. The density of air is correlated to temperature. What the true densities of air is at higher altitudes are no one can know because its almost always done hypothetically.</p>

<p>The air is the same mixture on Everest or at sea level. Yet if you filled a plastic bottle with it and brought it back down the bottle would be sucked in.

<p>Ok, so now you have the same mass of air inside the bottle but it occupies less volume. So its density has increased, density literally being defined as mass/volume. I think we agree on that.</p>

<p>You&#39;ve just argued that a bottle of air becomes more dense when you bring it down to a lower altitude. Or in other words, if you bring that same bottle back up, it will expand again and the air inside will become less dense.</p>

<p>So... air is less dense at higher altitudes? You&#39;ve just argued that a bottle of it becomes more dense at lower altitudes.</p>

<p>How is it the same mass of air? The entire point is that the volume holds a different mass of air at different altitude.</p>

<p>Weight is mass * gravity. Are you positing that both bottles weigh the same even if measured at sea level?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cannot find a single instance of Ozone being stored in a canister or vacuum. In fact all searches are directed to Ozone generators.</p>

<p>If its easy to generate why wouldn&#39;t there be canistered Ozone just like there is canistered [every gas there is]. Ozone has a half-life which is governed by temperature. It&#39;s claimed its because its an &quot;unstable molecule&quot; but its basically the exact same thing as a &quot;nuclear&quot; half-life.</p>

<p>Most interesting is <a href="http://www.lenntech.com/library/ozone/decomposition/ozone-decomposition.htm">temperature changes the decay rate...</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexknapp/2011/05/03/radioactive-decay-rates-may-not-be-constant-after-all/#68c15297147f">&quot;Radioactive&quot; decay rates are not constant</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>long-term observation of the decay rate of silicon-32 and radium-226 seemed to show a small <strong>seasonal</strong> variation. </p>

<p>Interesting that experiments to create <a href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/ie50556a024">liquid and isolated ozone in 1940s</a> caused spontaneous and unpredicted explosions.

    <div class="md"><p>Seems like you don&#39;t have any complaint about the image itself, then. That&#39;s good!</p>

<p>I think this is actually the sequel mission, imaginatively named Hayabusa-2. That&#39;s what a long elliptical orbit around a body that is itself orbiting something else looks like. Consider a point moving around in an elliptical shape, then take that elliptical path and drag it in a circle around something else. The result will look like that image. The fact that the spacecraft moves faster at the periapsis of its orbit is one of Kepler&#39;s laws:</p>

<p><a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/kepler.html">http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/kepler.html</a></p>

<p>As for <em>why</em> it obeys this (since Kepler&#39;s laws are only descriptive) it&#39;s Newton&#39;s law of universal gravitation which I&#39;m sure you know.</p>

<p>For fun: You can get a similar looking effect (not exactly the same because it&#39;s moving along a line) by playing around with cycloids, here is an example image:</p>

<p>I think the &quot;ISIS&quot; name was chosen after the Egyptian goddess. Though ISIS (terrorists) technically existed at the time the MRO was launched, I don&#39;t think hardly anybody knew who they were until 3 or 4 years ago. So in my opinion it really is a darkly humorous coincidence, like those poor people who were <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/20/isis-terrorism-jokes-woman-named-egyptian-goddess">named after the goddess</a> and now get harassed about it. :(</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nefarious is a loaded word. Many people who keep secrets do so for the benefit of others [or what they perceive as a necessary evil]. Though others react in opposition to that because they don&#39;t want to be protected - or they are seeking deeper meaning or truth. And for gain as well.</p>

<p>Nature of the beast. </p>

<p>Then in another frame - you have a long history of secrets and people start making connections - a narrative forms. Hard to gauge what the underlying reality is without being a part of it.</p>

<p>Also even if you are involved in something, doesn&#39;t necessarily mean you will be <em>aware</em> of something. Awareness can be described as [true] understanding the small and large implications of the environment. Which is basically wisdom. True sentiments that aren&#39;t overly specific applying across many situations.</p>

<p>It wasn&#39;t meant to imply nefarious action simply a statement of understanding.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What do you mean by &quot;stationary location&quot;?  Stationary in relation to what?  Everything in orbit is in motion around the earth&#39;s center of gravity, it&#39;s physically impossible just to &quot;hang&quot; in space -- in such a case the object would just plummet straight down to the earth at constant acceleration of 1 g.  </p>

<p>Also, why would NASA send up a camera to just record HD video for 24 hours straight?  That would require a ridiculous huge amount of storage space given the weight and transmission limitations of spacecraft.  If you want, NASA does have <a href="https://epic.gsfc.nasa.gov/epic-galleries/2015/first_light/full/187_2015187190111.png">satellites in high orbit that take pictures every couple hours</a>, which can be compiled into a <a href="https://www.space.com/33503-earth-full-year-video-from-space-dscovr-time-lapse.html">video of the earth&#39;s rotation</a>.  Since video is just still pictures shown rapidly, you can think of that as a video with a super slow framerate and super sped up replay.</p>

<p>Stars are much fainter than the Sun is, as well as the Earth and Moon (when they&#39;re lit up). They&#39;re not photoshopped out of these images, because exposure times short enough that the dayside Earth isn&#39;t washed out are too short for the stars to appear.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>every single star? really? plenty of photos and videos show the stars in the background. Plus if it was a real video we could see them adjusting the exposure to go from washing out the earth to viewing the stars. Why are you guys so brainwashed to believe the globe?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure, plenty of photos at night, or composites do. In fact there is some good ISS video where you can see the nightside Earth and some of the stars at once. This is just some random guy&#39;s upload, the first one I could find:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ev9oPUNaqXE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ev9oPUNaqXE</a></p>

<p>The problem is when the Earth is much brighter (during the day) you have a hard time with the exposure settings.</p>

<p>I &quot;believe&quot; in the globe because I have proved it for myself, with radio moonbounce and other work that only functions in the established model of the solar system.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>these are fake. I know because I have experience making 3d images and editing photos with photoshop. You can tell because if you compare what a know real video looks like flying over a surface. The ground doesn&#39;t behave like that. This video from the ISS looks heavily edited. First it gives the appearance that the globe is small. The bottom of the image and the top move at the same speed unlike real life. In a real situation the objects farther away appear to grow slowly while the objects in the foreground rush past the camera. Its all perspective. 
look up any video of anything flying where you are looking the ground to see what I mean. 
These fake ISS videos are just a regular video from the cockpit of plane flying and then they added a bunch of effects. like the artificial curve .</p>

I cannot present a video as proof,  it could be falsified, what I will do is pose two questions. First, explain a theory of tectonic plates and the shifting of the crust from the perspective of a non globular planet. Second, how would a satellite remain fixed in a position relative to a flat earth?  </p>

<p>Just a third question for the hell of it, given the number of satellites in earths orbit, and the multiple countries and private agencies that have launched these satellites, how likely is it that a flat earth would remain controversial? Additionally, what benefit would come to those who held that knowledge? </p>
