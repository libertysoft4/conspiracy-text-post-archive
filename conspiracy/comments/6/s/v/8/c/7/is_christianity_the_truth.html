And Satan according to the ancient record was the head of the heavenly orchestra that praised God and that satan himself in himself has pipes that plays beautiful music.

    <div class="md"><p>I always ask though, with the fear being god might be Satan or it&#39;s a lie, would an all loving god require subservience? Or create us and test us for our subservience? Or only leave one door open for a happy life? I don&#39;t want to feel as if those who don&#39;t have access to his words or his teachings are doomed all around the world in less fortunate places. Or or even those without education. Kind of a &quot;me or worse&quot; life doesn&#39;t scream all benevolent etc &gt;&lt;. Also don&#39;t want to think I got lucky enough to hear about him and others didn&#39;t. </p>

<p>On a last random thought, if ignorance of him excuses not living in him--does knowing about him present a test? Would ignorance be bliss? And better?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And atheism is not a cop out on someone being frustrared with it all so they say &quot;FUCK it none of its real&quot; is any better? Since the rise of Atheism,  nothing good has come from any government that has excepted its philosophy. Relgious nations have a bad rap, since they have spots in their history of extremism. But my gosh people living naked in the woods and forest to this day live happily even though  they font have what we have and they believe in something of a high power. Try and take athiests who have no moral high ground except what they picked and chose from Chrsitianity and tell them to thrive on a desert island. You will have chaos like you saw in every communist nation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That which is commanded to us like feed the poor and help the weak and take care of the fatherless and widows, dont steal dont murder and dont lie etc. All these are commandments that are made for us to treat each other as God woyld want us to.. the Old testament doctrines of not eating pork or not wearing multiole tyoes of cloth are no more. Why? Beacuse the new testament says so. But the laws on how to honor God and how to treat each other is always literal like a boss tells his associates what to do or a father instructs his kids to do a task. Prophesy and imagery is the only thing that can be interpreted.  Not a direct order.</p>

<p>According to conventional science, since there is mass + gravity + electricity, life is bound to evolve from a single cell organism.

    <div class="md"><p>My &quot;parenting&quot; analogies are much better.  </p>

<p>Like this one time, when I put a rasberry bush in their room (just because).  I said, &quot;don&#39;t eat this, or you may die.&quot;. Well, shockingly, they ate one.  So naturally, I kicked them out of the house,  inflicted terrible diseases on them, cursed them and my future grandkids, called the cops and said they stole my stuff, told the neighborhood kids to go smack em around and steal their shoes.  A few years later, I killed all of them except one.  I didn&#39;t let the surviving 8 year old back in the house, but I was generous enough to tell her to google up a phone number for a homeless shelter.  I know.  I&#39;m very caring and benevolent and wise.  </p>

<p>A few weeks later, I found out that she was in a homeless shelter downtown, so I went over and burned it to the ground.  To teach lessons, n stuff.  So, she got passed around on the street for a few years, then I mysteriously showed up one day, while she was laying in the gutter.  I bent down and whispered in her ear:. &quot;I did it because I love you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And those were <em>my</em> rasberries dammit.&quot;</p>

<p>My analogy is disturbingly more accurate than yours.  And my kids even got to keep their &quot;free will&quot; the entire time!  Isn&#39;t that special?!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>See you still dont get it. You have the mind of greed rather than a well balanced one, and you take the side of the pubishable greedy culprit instead of the fair gift giver.
If you had the whole world at your pleasure just like Adam amd Eve did, which was exactly the promise God gave them. Not just some tiny room with a plate of food like you poorly described. But a whole fucking planet to eat and live on . And you are told NOT TO EAT THIS ONE FRUIT. To this day you and me have many fruit that we cant eat due to just poisons or allergic reactions. But having the mature mind of past trails and errors we dont endulge in such stupidity. 
Adam and Eve had no experience what so ever on being disobediant. So thats their sin. You sinned before and so have we all. And its majority of the time doing things we were not supposed to do and did it anyways. Punishments came and went and we moved on. 
God had every right to honor his own word and kick them out for disobeying pretty much the simplest law to ever exist. But to them it was the only one.
So stop blamong God for doing exactly what he promised to do and stop defending curiosity that is based on ignorance. For as the saying goes. &quot;Curiosity killed the cat&quot; well thats the same as temptation. And how many people got sexual transmitted diseases through temptation? How many people got arrested by stealing? These are no different than Adam and Eve because like them we all are aware of the punishment but dont believe anything will happen because we followed out foolish hearts instead of using logic and reason. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You sure do have to jump through a lot of hoops, for God&#39;s murderous psychosis to &quot;make sense.&quot;. Take a look back, at all those mental gymnastics you have to do, to justify heinous actions.  If God created the world, didn&#39;t he create the rules?  Didn&#39;t he create the tree, specifically for this purpose?  He certainly didn&#39;t need it for himself, right?  And since he obviously didn&#39;t need  it, it was created just for Adam and Eve.  Then he set it right next to them, in this small garden, knowing that their naivety would lead to them eating it.  Just like any ignorant baby would.</p>

<p>But sure.  Blame the kiddos, for what was a sadistic setup in the first place.  Just know that you follow the Devil.

    <div class="md"><p>No, god made us with a free will. This allows us to choose between good and evil. He set up this tree to test his creation, nothing wrong here.</p>

<p>He couldve not set that tree there, ofcourse. But then, how could his creation choose?</p>

<p>He couldve made us different. Like creating us that we only can be good. But what is the purpose of that. That would be stupid. 
This way humans cant grow, this way humans will always join heaven. Or so, this way he couldve better created nothing, because its just a waste of time.</p>

<p>Now, stop disrespecting God. He is the creator. His rules are clear and good. You can only be mercyfull to him because he is giving you a chance. The body you live in, is his. You are only here because he gave it to you, with a free will, so you can grow in the way he wants. </p>

<p>If you created your children. And you want your children to walk on the good path. They need a free will to choose for this good path. But because &quot;good&quot; is made, there is &quot;evil&quot; too. 
Your children have the free will to choose for the right path. You even gave them the rules to do so. You created them with human nature, which means they know it when they are sinning/when they do something bad. Cuz they will feel bad when doing so. And you promised your children to join you, when they have grown as beings and chose for the right path. The children who fell for evil, you ofcourse wont take them with you. You have given them enough chances. </p>

<p>You can see this as a farm. You will only farm the plants that grew the way you wanted them to grow. (Or so taking them to heaven). And the plants that didnt grow the way you wanted, you will ofcourse not take with you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow i see your not normal as i used nothing but common examples of life to make my point,  and you called them loops?. Now you blame God for having a tree which he enjoyed but told them, (Adam and Eve), not to eat that and hes now the bad guy for just having it?
Do not parents drink alcohol or smoke today? And dont they have it for just themselves and tell thier kids not to do it? Knowing full well kids might sneek a sip or try a puff? 
Come on get real. Your trying to just Hate hate hate instead of being understanding.
We are humans and we know things before they happen like the examples i just easily gave you,  but we do it anyway for OUR enjoyment. 
God said all creation is for his enjoyment. The Tree of Good and Evil was like alcohol for kids to Adam and Eve and when they ate it they didnt die right then and their but like alcohol it says &quot;Their Eyes were open knowing good from evil&quot; and what did God say? He said &quot;look now they are like Us knowing good and evil&quot;. 
Its so freaking easy to understand yet you are doing everything in your power to just hate God and not want to underdtand.Stop it!</p>

<p>Hate religions and stupid man made doctrines and  traditions Sure. But to hate the creator of the universe who is the life force of all life just because you havent tried to just sit down in a room alone and give all your heart to him so he can finally find a place in your heart and life again is all on you. He wants to have a relationship with you but you dont let him. You refuse it because of nothing but pride and guilt. Its not like only a few wacky wierdos talk to Christ in some mountain somewhere. Billions do it and have been doing it for thousands of years. Like the lame Disney song goes &quot;LET IT GO&quot; lol . Let him in and your life will change.
But if you need convincing even more and need something to break open your stone cold heart , type in on YouTube &quot;Muslim or Jew or Atheist or Buddhist, or Satanist .. turn to Christ &quot; you  will see hundreds of videos of these. But turn it the other way around (christian to whatever) you will see maybe a handful of options amd they are as lame and empty as watching a commerical. There is no depth, no passion, no heart breaking realization of reality,  all those people have is hate.</p>

<p>I can find a lot of debate that Jesus died by crucifixion.  I can find mythicists which claim Jesus was a myth so there was no crucifixion, I can find plenty of scholars that claim that there was a historical Jesus, but that the stories about him are myths so the crucifixion is out, etc. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jesus gave up something that we find precious, our life.  Life as in meaning staying alive, to be able to live to the end of your days, most people wouldn&#39;t want to cut their life short willingly, especially knowing that they&#39;ll be tortured, spat on, and then be crucified for their sins, but Jesus did endure those things and He conquered death when He rose on the 3rd day.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Summary, Jesus died but not really died. </p>

<p>What the above paragraph expresses is a metaphysical contradiction that you avoid.  In order for there to be a sacrifice of life, it has to end. Not end for a little bit and come back like Lazarus or Jarius&#39;s daughter, or like when the dead man  touches Elisha&#39;s bones and be raised. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Kings 13:21 (KJV)
21 And it came to pass, as they were burying a man, that, behold, they spied a band of men; and they cast the man into the sepulchre of Elisha: and when the man was let down, and touched the bones of Elisha, he revived, and stood up on his feet.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So you can&#39;t commit to a real sacrifice, to a real death of god theology. If you did then Christianity would be false, but you could salvidge the belief in a deity etc. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay so a lot of religion all has similar contexts. They all say to follow simple rules about not being a dick to each other and that you are part of something bigger.</p>

<p>Some go further and give rules on food prep and what can / can&#39;t be eaten which rules more around what was safe back then and basic principles that they believed (like not torturing an animal before death and not eating the legs of animals because it&#39;s lived it whole life standing in shit ect.</p>

<p>Most larger religions have lost the actual values and are more focused on forcing others to view the world through their blinkered belief system.</p>

<p>God gaia Allah it&#39;s literally all the same thing just in different words. </p>

<p>Religion shouldn&#39;t cost money. 
Religion shouldnt make money.
Religion shouldn&#39;t be preached or pushed upon anyone else, but should be taught so that people sent left ignorance. Ignorance breeds fear. </p>

<p>I&#39;d say if you want to find what&#39;s true, then study a few religions and see what feels right for you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So I think the biggest misconception with religion is Love. </p>

<p>God did not &#39;show&#39; love, he IS love. So, if you love, you are going Gods work. You don&#39;t have o believe in God to love, but if you do believe it gives a sort or purpose to the love. Jesus WAS love in the flesh. he wasn&#39;t a magician or wizard, he infact was so much love that he had full capabilities over love and energy. </p>

<p>now people use religion to hate so much and they have for thousands of years. you see how using love to hate is the opposite of everything he teaches. and importantly, you can see that with love there comes no judgement, no worry, all positive. and positivity and love grows, so when you pray, it&#39;s not to this white beard dude in the sky, you are praying to love, and the love and energy that is omnipresent in the world will receive your loving intent and dish it right back at ya. When you worry it&#39;s the same but the opposite, but think about how an entire mass of people all praying good intent for something actually makes a difference. you see it happen time and time again. It&#39;s all love, it&#39;s all energy. God is love. </p>
