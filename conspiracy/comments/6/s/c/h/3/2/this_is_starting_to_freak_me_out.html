    <div class="md"><p>This is exactly it. </p>

<p>I always hear about these &quot;It heard me say something then gave me an ad stuff&quot;, and i know of course some apps will do that while they listen in on you, but there is also the aspect that people always forget that everyone in your phone is linked and it builds a web of social media which they likely have done countless analyses on to determine who would likely best influence other people in their social network and what ads would be effective in that sense.</p>

<p>I know because i have never had that happen to me until the other day i got an ad for a casino that i know is local to me and i go to all the time but have never got an ad from before on facebook. Then later that day my gf calls me and tells me she&#39;s looking up concerts at that casino and i figure out that since we&#39;re both on facebook it linked us together and targets us with similar ads. I&#39;m sure other services utilize similar tactics like g+ and twitter etc..</p>

<p>it&#39;s likely that many convos people have about buying something or going somewhere they&#39;ve googled either before or after this event. So of course you&#39;ll see ads relating but it could be from other people you know googling it not just you.</p>

<p>They say it&#39;s so they can listen in the background for &quot;songs playing or TV shows your watching&quot;... or, ya know, the private conversations that you&#39;re having with friends and loved ones.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Congrats! don&#39;t just delete the app... delete your entire account. You can google how to download a backup of your FB so you can keep all the pictures and what-not (that was my biggest thing) and you can permanently delete it (not just deactivate it).</p>

<p>I did this about 3 years ago and I never regretted it one bit.</p>

<p>Trying to get my Gf to delete hers. I was talking to her about my travel hack cc&#39;s (she doesn&#39;t even have a credit score let alone a cc) and her FB started advertising Chase travel cards (the ones you need 730+ credit score to get) on nearly every page she visited. She never googled anything about it on her laptop and she doesn&#39;t have the FB app on her phone. She goes on FB from google chrome.</p>

<p>Not sure how they&#39;re recording us, but FB 100% is and I would bet a bunch of other sites are too!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re welcome! I have since tried to log back in and it says the account doesn&#39;t exist, which tells me I can&#39;t get it back if I wanted to. I would highly recommend deleting it, not just deactivating it. </p>

<p>Knowing that you can download all the content helps too. I think that&#39;s a big reason more people don&#39;t delete it - They don&#39;t want to lose all the memories they put on there in the past 5-10 years. I&#39;ll be honest though - I haven&#39;t looked at the backup content since I deleted it 3+ years ago. It&#39;s just nice to know I still have it.</p>

<p>You have a FB and FB is a multi-billion dollar a year company, but how much money have you ever given them directly? None.</p>

<p>Actually they have a lot of info. They know your location (unless you use vpn), what you&#39;re interested in and what device your using. If they compare that to info from other sources they can pin point who you are exactly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Facebook has admitted to using audio fingerprinting to identify songs and TV shows in the background to serve you targeted advertisements. They claim this only occurs when you intentionally activate the microphone (for a voice call or voice-to-text) and that the information is never tied to your profile.<br/>
As I mentioned in a post earlier today, some advertisers are now broadcasting ultrasonic tones in media (and in stores) that can be picked up by certain apps to track you or tie your IRL identity to your online identity.       </p>

    <div class="md"><p>realistically though, its not so much spying as it is advertising research/targeting. Do they do anything else with the information they get, well probably, but at least from an aspect where we can actually see the results, it seems to be used specifically with ad targeting. </p>

<p>From my personal experience, so far it has been more of a convenience then a nuisance, but maybe that is just what they want me to think....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alright, now take off your addblock. </p>

<p>Printscreen the screen and count all the adds. All. And not in facebook but some more neutral thing.</p>

<p>Count all the concerts, count all the items, everything they want you to buy and every event they invite you to.</p>

<p>Then count from those the events and items that are <em>strangely</em> private to you. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>It doesn&#39;t count that Metallica is playing, everyone listens to it. So if 80% of your friends know the band, item, it doesn&#39;t count.</p></li>
<li><p>No generalizing. &quot;Hey, I eat food, they are showing me food!&quot; The item needs to be specific, like a specific adapter or 20 year old movie without a sequel.</p></li>
<li><p>The conversation in reference needs to be recent. &quot;Hey I talked to Bil about Detroit 6 months ago and here is a travel agency mentioning Detroit!!!&quot; It has to be recent and specific. </p></li>
<li><p>You must be completely sure that you have never mentioned that or googled it online. You must be sure that you had the conversation completely unrelated. If you talked about &quot;Bob&#39;s Burgers&quot; because they have an advert on the radio, you can be sure the company will have adverts other places too. So it needs to be completely random. And you have to be sure that the conversation partner has also not googled it. If they tag you in FB constantly and you both use the same IP (and whatever other algorithms may hide there) it&#39;s a closed case.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>So do all this. Critically check the amount of <em>real</em> coincidences there. Of course, what you perceive as &quot;real&quot; and how big of a number you will need so that something is &quot;proven&quot; is completely up to you. Still, I suggest you do all these things. </p>

<p>This is not me denying this shit happens. This is approaching it scientifically not to denounce, but to continue the investigation, so to say.</p>

<p>Now, if you see that there are some wicked shit showing up, try to figure out where did the &quot;leak&quot; happen. If it is a phone conversation, a real conversation near Smart devices or a purchase in Walmart, act accordingly. Check that shit out. If it was a conversation on phone, call your friend and talk about &quot;Planning a trip to Ontario&quot;, &quot;Buying a Lexus S3214&quot;. Make sure the examples are very specific but, at the same time, something still in the market. Then monitor all the adverts and count how many you see til a relevant one pops up.</p>

<p>There should not be idle sitting around in a wank-circle and telling spooky stories to each other. Check this shit out. </p>

<p>Me myself, I have also noticed these adverts. But they have always been in connection to things I&#39;ve done on the internets. I do not have phone conversations often and I don&#39;t live in an English speaking country, so I&#39;m not a good &quot;example&quot; or data point. </p>

<p>Every time you go shopping, you share intimate details about your consumption patterns with retailers. And many of those retailers are studying those details to figure out what you like, what you need, and which coupons are most likely to make you happy. Target TGT +0.52%, for example, has figured out how to data-mine its way into your womb, to figure out whether you have a baby on the way long before you need to start buying diapers.</p>

<p>Charles Duhigg outlines in the New York Times how Target tries to hook parents-to-be at that crucial moment before they turn into rampant -- and loyal -- buyers of all things pastel, plastic, and miniature. He talked to Target statistician Andrew Pole -- before Target freaked out and cut off all communications -- about the clues to a customer&#39;s impending bundle of joy. Target assigns every customer a Guest ID number, tied to their credit card, name, or email address that becomes a bucket that stores a history of everything they&#39;ve bought and any demographic information Target has collected from them or bought from other sources. Using that, Pole looked at historical buying data for all the ladies who had signed up for Target baby registries in the past. From the NYT:</p>

<p>[Pole] ran test after test, analyzing the data, and before long some useful patterns emerged. Lotions, for example. Lots of people buy lotion, but one of Pole’s colleagues noticed that women on the baby registry were buying larger quantities of unscented lotion around the beginning of their second trimester. Another analyst noted that sometime in the first 20 weeks, pregnant women loaded up on supplements like calcium, magnesium and zinc. Many shoppers purchase soap and cotton balls, but when someone suddenly starts buying lots of scent-free soap and extra-big bags of cotton balls, in addition to hand sanitizers and washcloths, it signals they could be getting close to their delivery date.</p>

<p>Or have a rather nasty infection...</p>

<p>As Pole’s computers crawled through the data, he was able to identify about 25 products that, when analyzed together, allowed him to assign each shopper a “pregnancy prediction” score. More important, he could also estimate her due date to within a small window, so Target could send coupons timed to very specific stages of her pregnancy.</p>

<p>One Target employee I spoke to provided a hypothetical example. Take a fictional Target shopper named Jenny Ward, who is 23, lives in Atlanta and in March bought cocoa-butter lotion, a purse large enough to double as a diaper bag, zinc and magnesium supplements and a bright blue rug. There’s, say, an 87 percent chance that she’s pregnant and that her delivery date is sometime in late August.</p>

<p>And perhaps that it&#39;s a boy based on the color of that rug?</p>

<p>So Target started sending coupons for baby items to customers according to their pregnancy scores. Duhigg shares an anecdote -- so good that it sounds made up -- that conveys how eerily accurate the targeting is. An angry man went into a Target outside of Minneapolis, demanding to talk to a manager:</p>

<p>English: Photograph of abdomen of a pregnant woman
Target knows before it shows.
“My daughter got this in the mail!” he said. “She’s still in high school, and you’re sending her coupons for baby clothes and cribs? Are you trying to encourage her to get pregnant?”</p>

<p>The manager didn’t have any idea what the man was talking about. He looked at the mailer. Sure enough, it was addressed to the man’s daughter and contained advertisements for maternity clothing, nursery furniture and pictures of smiling infants. The manager apologized and then called a few days later to apologize again.</p>

<p>(Nice customer service, Target.)</p>

<p>On the phone, though, the father was somewhat abashed. “I had a talk with my daughter,” he said. “It turns out there’s been some activities in my house I haven’t been completely aware of. She’s due in August. I owe you an apology.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Welcome to the Internet - not as it was, but how it became - where individual/corporate data patterns is the most-precious-resource mined for social coercion and further development by those now in control.</p>

<p>Little more than fifteen years ago this was a fringe concern, then <em>conspiracy</em> theory, now unsettling reality. Everything you do, say, <em>and soon</em> think has/is/will be utilized as the primary means of social prediction and control.</p>

<p>Suggestions: stay clear of <em>social</em> and moreso <em>free</em> apps , sites, and services unless you have measures in place to limit reference to your actual individual. Know that <em>everything</em> expressed or researched on or around &quot;connected&quot; devices is susceptible to outside access and will be used to influence everything you do.</p>

<p>For most, it&#39;s too late to <em>keep your individual privacy.</em> Data captured years ago, in the infancy of the Web and social apps/sites, is already out there, and likely sufficient to have established a comprehensive profile on one&#39;s ideology, preferences, and future tendencies.</p>

<p>Unless you intend to wipe what you have access to, then unplug and remain off-grid for the remainder of your life, these intrusions on individual privacy and sovereignty are part of our digital age.</p>

<p>But we have <em>nothing to hide</em>, right?</p>

Also, I never logged into this on my phone or any type of app.  Just my pc at work.

How in the fuck did it know who I was?  I have zero personal info on my work pc other than the outlook email server that we use that&#39;s passworded.

    <div class="md"><p>Here is a little info for you.  It&#39;s from 12 years ago.  Please keep that in mind that this is what we had over a decade ago.</p>

<p>I contracted to a small &quot;credit rating&quot; company.  No sign on the building, no website.<br/>
They had an incredible about of data on 93 million US citizens.  I&#39;m talking every time the major discount grocery card users swiped, it was minutes before the had the data.  Bank transactions through major credit companies, utility bills, all of it was aggregated an analyzed.<br/>
Here is where it freaked me out (12 years ago).  You spend $1,283.12 at Best Buy (random example, may or may not have participated).  The company knows, by comparison of the cost sheet, that you either bought one specific television model, two laptops, 12 washing machines or 1,000 movies.  It weights the probabilities.  Not long after the additional power you use after you get home at 5:30pm matches that specific model of television.  The match is now certain.<br/>
Here is a fun one for you.  Next time you go through a toll booth or some round about, ask yourself this.  &quot;What information was just pulled from my tire pressure sensors?&quot;...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh yes!  Same thing with me and my partner.  We were talking on Skype about certain stuff and then when we open our FB, ads related to what we were talking about just popped out.  Not only that man, one time we bought a box of this English Breakfast Tea using our credit card.  When I got home and logged in on FB, there it was - an ad of the English Breakfast Tea that we bought.  Yes, same brand and all.  There&#39;s no privacy anymore! </p>

I&#39;ve lost count of the number of times I have been talking with someone about something totally random that I&#39;ve never googled before and what happens next?  I go to the google search bar and type in the first three letters and like magic exactly what I&#39;m looking for pops up.

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s actually been happening over a year. </p>

<p>Last year, in June, I visited my grandparents farm. </p>

<p>At the dinner table, I mentioned a dish my mom makes some times with kale. </p>

<p>Kale. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve never searched kale on any device, or anything. </p>

<p>Literally less than two hours later I had an ad on Instagram (owned by FB) for kale. </p>

<p>I was pretty creeped out by it, but mostly amused at how poorly aimed their targeted ad was (I hate kale). </p>

<p>However I&#39;ve noticed the ads are becoming more finely tuned to my lifestyle. </p>

<p>Not 2 minutes later I opened the facebook mobile page in safari and was greeted with a banner at the top, which I had never seen before, telling me how great the app was and that I should install it.</p>

<p>No idea how it even caught that but I almost feel like it was just to fuck with me. </p>

I mentioned to my buddies that &quot;After a good night of drinking, Pedialyte will cure what ails you&quot;... 2 days later I started getting ads for pedialyte almost word for word what I originally said.

<p>Brother told me he and his wife are laying in bed with the tv off and suddenly Siri on her phone goes&quot;sorry I didn&#39;t get that&quot;. Neither of them were talking or watching tv.</p>

<p>The next day I&#39;m browsing Reddit and the sidebar ad is an ad entirely in Finnish. I had never and since seen an ad in any language other than English or Reddit. </p>
