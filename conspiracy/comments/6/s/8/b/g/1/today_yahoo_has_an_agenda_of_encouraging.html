To me, this is encouraging child transsexuality and normalizing pedophilia.</p>

<p>I find the recent encouragement of transsexuality in children to be the first stages of western depopulation. Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) is proven to make the recipient sterile. The main &quot;treatment&quot; for someone claiming to be transgendered is HRT. And now HRT is being approved for children. This has potential make an entire generation non-fertile and unable to reproduce.</p>

<p>As far as normalizing pedophilia, we have seen this over and over and over from multiple sources. It not normal, and should not be considered &quot;normal&quot; in any shape or form.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As an adult who as a child dressed in the opposite gendered clothes and acted like the opposite gender, I am HIGHLY ALARMED by all the trans stuff targeted at kids. Forcing these complex topics and labels on young kids is absolutely child abuse. Kids need to be left time and space to figure out who they are as people, while also growing to understand concepts like time, permeance and gender. Labels are inherently constraining and not good for young kids anyhow. </p>

<p>There are many reasons why kids might want to be the opposite sex, many of which aren&#39;t permanent or biological. Kids have a hard time putting words to these reasons. But if we tell these kids this is because they are &quot;trans&quot; and put on them all these ideas that kids cannot fully comprehend, we will end up with kids who grow up to be adults permanently scarred both emotionally and physically, possibly left infertile by this direction. </p>

<p>We don&#39;t let kids get tattoos in childhood because we know they cannot comprehend permanence and who they might become later in life. We don&#39;t let kids get married or consent to sex because we understand they aren&#39;t capable of fully understanding the consequences of these things. Yet, many want us to let a 8 year old go on hormone therapy to permanently  change their growing body. It&#39;s NOT right. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They&#39;re not looking to change that part. There&#39;s no good reason to, especially since it would cause trans youth far more harm than benefit and among other things severely reduce adult sexual function.</p>

<p>Puberty suppressors are not hormone therapy, are fully reversible, have been used safely for decades, and are explicitly to allow trans youth time to mature before making the huge decision of whether to let their body develop male or female. They&#39;re the direct result of acknowledging that young teenagers may be too young to make that sort of decision just yet.</p>

<p>These suppress only sex hormones, not the rest of puberty itself - so they continue growing taller for instance, and just don&#39;t develop secondary sexual characteristics. This may in fact be closer to &#39;normal&#39;, given that puberty has been happening earlier and earlier at an accelerated rate. A century or two ago, puberty didn&#39;t even hit until the mid to late teens.</p>

<p>Regardless, the benefits still far outweigh the costs - most would rather have a happy kid with slightly stunted growth than a kid who&#39;s dead from suicide or heavily depressed from dysphoria. Even if puberty blockers shaved a decade off the average lifespan (which it doesn&#39;t), most people would still consider it far better than the alternative.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>How old are you talking? I know of rare exceptions where 14 year olds have been approved for HRT (sometimes because they have severe body dysphoria and are incredibly suicidal), but they are not the norm, and are usually given a much lower dosage that imitates normal puberty. The standard is still 16.</p>

<p>Neither are they jumping the gun, because in those cases they need a lot of doctors&#39; approval and assessment to get there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well it is jumping the gun if anyone thinks an 11 year old or even a 16 year old has the brain development to understand permanence and consequences. I understand how the hormone and puberty suppressants work. One of my closest friends counsels in this field.</p>

<p>But on top of all of it, there is damage done when kids are not given the opportunity to learn who they are at an early age, psychologically. Kids need to be given a chance to exist outside of complex labels they don&#39;t have the capacity to fully understand. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not necessarily about understanding permanence and consequences (which I believe 16 year olds at least definitely do), but about wanting to stop things that cause them pain, which requires no maturity.</p>

<p>It&#39;s precisely the understanding of permanence that makes them so desperate to start in the first place - they understand that many of puberty&#39;s effects are irreversible.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I agree, but that&#39;s what puberty blockers are for. It buys them time. Right now, the evidence is that persisting gender dysphoria at the onset of puberty (12, 13) is practically certain to persist through life, with figures at or approaching 100%. By that age, these are kids who in all likelihood are going to grow up to be transgender adults.</p>

<p>So, when allowing medical intervention, the worst case scenario is that maybe 1% of youth treated realise they aren&#39;t trans after all or don&#39;t wish to transition. They go off the blockers, and just have puberty later than their peers. Maybe (though there&#39;s no evidence for this) they experience some stunted development, but are otherwise able to lead perfectly normal lives, including having children of their own.</p>

<p>Whereas if you deny such intervention to trans youth, the worst case scenario is that 99% of them grow increasingly distressed with their bodies, and will likely meet the current benchmark of about 41% attempting suicide. Rates for depression, anxiety and other mental health issues skyrocket during puberty for untreated trans youth; in the meantime, they&#39;ll be stuck developing bodies at odds with their identities, that may necessitate expensive and painful surgery in future to rid themselves of the dysphoria.</p>

<p>On the other hand, allowing that intervention eases that pain, and allows them to develop bodies phenotypically similar to others of their gender (voice, bone structure, etc). This eliminates a large contributor to psychological distress, and makes it a lot easier for them to blend in, reducing their vulnerability to assault and allowing them to have a normal life.</p>

<p>This approach has had overwhelmingly positive results. <a href="http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2014/09/02/peds.2013-2958.abstract">Here&#39;s</a> a follow-up study done on trans youth who went on blockers followed by HRT. 7 years later, there were no regrets, all were satisfied, and their mental health was assessed to actually be better than that of their non-trans peers. This is all the more striking in comparison with that of trans youth who are not able to transition, as well as those who are only able to transition in adulthood. <a href="http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2016/02/24/peds.2015-3223">Other studies</a> on socially transitioned pre-pubescent children show similar positive results, finding them to have normative mental health compared to the high occurrence of non-transitioned trans children their age.</p>

<p>Early medical intervention does actually save lives, and significantly improves the quality of those lives. While I understand the concern that someone who isn&#39;t actually trans may end up receiving treatments that are wrong for them, the chance of this happening is statistically very low, and the damage done to that individual would be minimal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, I can see where you are coming from with the puberty blockers. I did a little more research on them, and while they can have an negative impact on the body (like any pharmaceutical) the emotional impact of possibly being in the wrong body and having that forced on you more strongly in the middle of an already intense time in anyone&#39;s life could cause way more damage. </p>

<p>My biggest issue with it lies on the psychological side when kids are younger than puberty age, just because of my own personal experience. I dressed in opposite sex attire until about puberty, could even go as far as saying I wanted to be the opposite sex, but it was for reasons I could not articulate yet. Not necessarily because I was trapped in the wrong body. My parents did a good job of protecting me from outside influence and labels which allowed me to become who I truly am. Once I got older, I learned that adults labeled me homosexual or transgendered, but because those concepts never reached me, I got to just be me without it meaning anything more than me being me. And in reality, I never gave it much thought. I just did what I liked and what made me feel comfortable at the time. The growing approach of actively labeling these kids makes me concerned for those who might be on the fence or dressing in opposite sex attire for other reasons. Sometimes dawning labels is not beneficial for kids because if they don&#39;t know who they are yet, how can we force adult concepts on to them which tell them who they are?</p>

<p>Kids need time to just be and figure themselves out as they grow up and while it&#39;s very small circles of society which seem to be jumping the gun, I worry if the approach is going to continue to grow. And I worry about the kids getting these constricting labels at an early age. Labels are always constricting. Adults like to keep things neat and tidy, but life and nature are never that simple. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I agree with that, which is why I mentioned young teenagers rather than children. From the stories I&#39;ve heard of kids with a similar childhood as you, their desire to be the other sex was usually down to reasons that weren&#39;t technically about that: e.g. a boy who wanted to be a girl so he could play with &#39;girl toys&#39;, and a young lesbian who thought that the only way she&#39;d be &#39;allowed&#39; to like girls would be if she were a boy. By the time they hit puberty, their response to physical changes or impending physical changes usually overrides that, and then it becomes a biological rather than social issue.</p>

<p>This was one problem with the DSM-III and IV, where you and others would likely have met the criteria for Gender Identity Disorder. It&#39;s behind the alleged stat of 80-90% of trans children not growing up into trans adults. Many of them weren&#39;t actually trans in the first place, despite meeting GID criteria. But we&#39;re now on the DSM-V, which places less emphasis on stereotypical interests and closes some of those loopholes to more effectively screen for trans kids.</p>

<p>For me, while as a kid I desperately wanted to be a boy, at the onset of puberty I discovered to my horror that I was attracted to boys. I thought that this meant I&#39;d &#39;have&#39; to be a girl, then (which is also what everyone had been insisting I was) and was very upset but resigned. Yet with the physical changes came major, major body dysphoria that made it impossible for me to just accept what others were telling me I was, and after spending my teen years in clinical depression I eventually came out at 21 and transitioned to male. The past 7 years since have been the best of my life.</p>

<p>That&#39;s one reason I have trouble believing that kids might submit so easily to the labels forced on them. It didn&#39;t work for me, despite my own and everyone&#39;s efforts (conservative Christian upbringing) and my complete lack of knowledge that gay trans men could even exist. I was convinced I couldn&#39;t be trans if I liked guys. I have no reason to expect my identity to be any more resilient than others, and so I&#39;m sure that if a young teen were wrongly labelled as trans, they&#39;d notice that and do something; admitting one was wrong is embarrassing and difficult, but it would be nothing compared to experiencing one&#39;s body develop in a way that feels completely wrong.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been reading up a lot on the protocol for trans youth, and the doctors and psychiatrists involved are all very aware of the issues you mention. There&#39;s a lot of emphasis of treating each child as a separate case, and taking things slowly. Their priority is in reducing distress rather than putting them on any particular transition path: e.g. if a kid is extremely upset at having long hair, give them a haircut. If they really want a partcular toy or clothes that&#39;s for the &#39;wrong&#39; gender, let them. These are all done without social transition, and continuing to refer to them as their assigned gender and pronouns. But if those things are themselves a persistent source of distress, they change them accordingly and see what happens. It&#39;s basically a harm-reduction approach with a lot of monitoring to see what works and what doesn&#39;t.</p>

<p>I know of one frustrated mother with a feminine son where well-meaning adults keep asking if he&#39;s a trans girl, or peers telling him he should be a girl, but he&#39;s adamant that he&#39;s not, and angry that they keep asking. Should they push him further, it&#39;s possible he might get confused, but it&#39;s the sort of thing that would come up in any psychiatric assessment - &quot;Why do you want to be a girl?&quot; / &quot;I don&#39;t want to be a girl, but everyone keeps telling me I should be&quot; - and would be an instant red flag that this kid is not trans.</p>

<p>Same approach at puberty - IIRC one study on trans youth found that only about a third were assessed to be suitable candidates for puberty blockers, and out of that third not all of them chose to do so, even if they were firm in their trans identity. So it&#39;s definitely not a matter of adults taking non-gender-conforming kids and pushing them straight into social transition and then puberty blockers, because there are a lot of checks and balances along the way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Suppose you spent your whole life burying your sexuality because other people didn&#39;t like it or thought it was too &quot;dirty&quot; or &quot;deviant&quot;. Every activity that is perfectly normal to another couple - kissing your beloved, holding hands in public, having a wedding, having or adopting a child - gets shamed up one side and down the other when it comes to you.</p>

<p>When you break away from that worldview, and find yourself an accepting community, do you think you&#39;re going to go &quot;well I should really suppress things a bit and try not to make people uncomfortable&quot;? Remember, the people who are uncomfortable with it are the same people who have spent your entire life telling you that your happiness equals the decay of society as we know it (and that&#39;s if your lucky - many of them think it&#39;s a personal moral failing on your part). It&#39;s not so surprising that some folks have no interest in playing along after that sort of treatment.</p>

<p>Like, I&#39;m a relative moderate, and I had the advantage of changing my worldview long before I knew I was trans.

<p>The number of people born with gender dysphoria is estimated to be about 0.005% to 0.014% in males and 0.002% to 0.003% in females (<a href="http://dsm.psychiatryonline.org/doi/book/10.1176/appi.books.9780890425596">http://dsm.psychiatryonline.org/doi/book/10.1176/appi.books.9780890425596</a> Page 454). This shows that only a minute number of people have gender dysphoria due to internal influences. </p>

<p>What we see today is gender dysphoria up to 1.2% in New Zealand high-school students (<a href="http://www.jahonline.org/article/S1054-139X(13)00753-2/fulltext">http://www.jahonline.org/article/S1054-139X(13)00753-2/fulltext</a>) and a more average percentage of 0.5% in Massachusetts adults (<a href="http://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/abs/10.2105/AJPH.2011.300315?journalCode=ajph">http://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/abs/10.2105/AJPH.2011.300315?journalCode=ajph</a>). </p>

<p>This shows that most people with gender dysphoria didn&#39;t spend their whole life with it, as you&#39;ve claimed, but instead have been externally influenced by peers, media, school, and society in general later on in life.</p>

<p>This could just as well be turned the other way around. Do you know how often the word &quot;bigot&quot; is thrown around when people criticize the LGBT community? I don&#39;t oppose the LGBT community simply because they are different than me. I oppose it because I have legitimate concerns for society. </p>

<p>I have never gotten any constructive feedback after I voice my opinion. Just a bunch of emotions and buzzwords.</p>

<p>This didn&#39;t happen so much 75+ years ago. Society has been on a steady downhill course for quite a few decades now. The efflorescence of the LGBT community is yet another example of this.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think being in the LGBT community means you are equatable to a child molester, but I believe that the LGBT community is the next step towards enabling pedophilia.

<p>The full page is paywalled, but I suspect you are grossly misinterpreting those numbers, which are several orders of magnitude below the usual numbers. I usually use numbers between 0.2% and 0.5%, depending on where a person in question is drawing the line. The <a href="https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/research/how-many-adults-identify-as-transgender-in-the-united-states/">Williams Institute</a> at UCLA estimates 700k trans people in the US, which accords with my numbers.</p>

<p>0.005% is 1 in 20,000, which would yield 15,600 trans people in the US. <a href="/r/asktransgender">/r/asktransgender</a> alone has triple that number of subscribers (just shy of 45,000) and is, as the rest of Reddit is, predominantly US-based, so that number fails even a basic smell test.</p>

<p>Even if that is a correctly cited number, and I seriously doubt that it is, the discrepancy has many other possible explanations. Maybe only a small fraction seek or access treatment, or maybe the DSM is using a much stricter definition (e.g. &quot;has had sex reassignment surgery&quot;) that lowers the number.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What we see today is gender dysphoria up to 1.2% in New Zealand high-school students</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Alternately, 1.2% of NZ high school students are happy to troll a poll. See <a href="http://slatestarcodex.com/2013/04/12/noisy-poll-results-and-reptilian-muslim-climatologists-from-mars/">this article</a> on problems with very small subgroups being drowned out by trolls, misunderstandings, or deliberate sabotage.</p>

<p>But again, even if that number were accurate, so what? Unless you have evidence to suggest that many of them <em>don&#39;t</em> feel that way decades later - and you don&#39;t, because the only evidence even suggestive of such a conclusion is in small children and is full of holes - all you&#39;ve shown is that youth are more likely to self-identify than the old. But that&#39;s true for e.g. sexuality, as well; <a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/201731/lgbt-identification-rises.aspx">Millennials are many times more likely than the pre-WWII generation to identify as LGBT in general</a> (which, because of the relative prevalences, is effectively a number for LGB people).</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>As above, it shows nothing of the kind, even assuming that your numbers are accurate (which I do not think they are).</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>No, you don&#39;t. None of your concerns are borne out by fact, and yes, it is a little bit unpleasant to have my well-being in my private life ascribed to a shadowy and motive-less conspiracy to destroy all that is good and decent.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yeah, no kidding. The same goes for me.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t really hope to win over someone who thinks whites are hopelessly discriminated against, that Trump is Literally The Most Oppressed, and that colonialism was great for everyone involved. Your post history is practically a checklist of bullshit far-right talking points, which means you&#39;re effectively operating in a totally different reality from me. There&#39;s not a lot of point.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You are extremely out of touch with history because relatively speaking, you are a radical. I am the moderate one here. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>&#39;Relative&#39; there was &#39;to other LGBT people&#39;, not to history as a whole. I freely admit that I think most of history got this one wrong.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Society has been on a steady downhill course for quite a few decades now.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I mean, aside from things like violent crime, major wars, economic stability, and &quot;number of billions of people starving&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The percentage of single mothers, feminism (the two are related)</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>checks another box</em></p>

<p>Oh! Oh! I think that&#39;s a bingo!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&#39;t think being in the LGBT community means you are equatable to a child molester, but I believe that the LGBT community is the next step towards enabling pedophilia.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Okay, setting aside how absurd this claim is for a second - why? How is it possibly worth setting up a massive, multi-decadal, multi-stage conspiracy involving every major medical organization on the planet to normalize diddling kids? Who the hell benefits? Even if we - for some reason - took for granted that everyone in power is a pedophile, someone with that kind of absurdly far-reaching power doesn&#39;t really need to worry about public views anyway.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The logic is that if kids have the cognitive ability to think up their gender, why can&#39;t they consent to sex too? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because one is demonstrably damaging to them and the other is not.</p>

<p>Lol, the first stage? You&#39;re a few decades late to the party. This is just another little tactic in a long line of tactics aimed at destabilizing and depopulating us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hate replies like this. Demons do not actually exist and if they did, you should read their history. 
They were called Daemons once and were actually bringers of knowledge. You could raise a Daemon if you needed help in a particular field. They came as scientists or just general helpers. 
Like a daemon based internet almost. Not the most evil thing I have ever heard of.
Then the church came along and didn&#39;t like knowledge...the rest is history.
All you do is quote some bible propaganda, like a good slave to god. Read up on things. Knowledge is power to recognise what is really going on.</p>
