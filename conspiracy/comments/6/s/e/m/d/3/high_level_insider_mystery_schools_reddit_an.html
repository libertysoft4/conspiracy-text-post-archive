        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><em>I&#39;ve been meaning to pen this post (or one like it) for some time now. A number of contributing factors means that time is more or less now.</em></p>

<p>So here it is.</p>

<p><strong>High Level Insider</strong></p>

<p>About a Year  ago, I came across the [High Level Insider question threads](https:/reddit.com<a href="/r/conspiracy/comments/5rnio2/high_level_insider_an_explanation_of_the_anon_and/">/r/conspiracy/comments/5rnio2/high_level_insider_an_explanation_of_the_anon_and/</a>). </p>

<p>(<em>Further detail on HLI are provided across the post if you&#39;ve not heard of the anon before and don&#39;t wish to read the sessions right now</em>) </p>

<p>Shortly after that, with the help of some likeminded users, we discovered the anon had a number of Alts on Reddit- one was a legacy account, the other still active. What I&#39;m about to impart is the sum total of my experience with the anon to date. If you check back through my post history you&#39;ll see my earlier (and rather more crude) efforts to raise awareness on this. I&#39;m doing so now as the anons most recent incarnation seems to have disappeared , so I feel less prickish about subjecting them to the inevitable deluge of enquiries that will ensue after this post. But I can&#39;t overstate how valuable the insights gained from studying the anon have been for me. The narrative they present and solutions they offer are both novel and inspiring. It&#39;s the Internet so of course it&#39;s impossible to know if they&#39;re speaking with 100% veracity, but without taking the time to adequately look into this, writing it off as a committed LARP, seems more naive than taking it as gospel.</p>

<p>I only ask that you read with an open mind and take the time to perform the due diligence that should be a requisite for any prudent investigator. </p>

<p><strong>tl:dr</strong>  - Things aren&#39;t as fucked as they appear, it seems as if we might have a shot.*</p>

<hr/>

<p>u/freedomintensifies - <strong>The Legacy Account</strong></p>

<p>I&#39;ll start with the legacy account that we discovered after the question sessions on /pol. If I recall correctly it was a combination of certain phrases, the subjects discussed, and the (trademark) clarity when discussing the complex &amp; novel, that led us to conclude the anon was one and the same. I followed up with a jocular, but respectful message asking if they&#39;d confirm our suspicions - didn&#39;t think they&#39;d respond. But they did. </p>

<p>You&#39;ll find further reading on a diverse array of topics across their comment history, but the comment I feel most elucidates the connection would be their breakdown on September 11 and then introducing the Space Elevator:</p>

<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/29w6a1/comment/cipeu12?st=J62H2BXB&amp;sh=a69c6e72">u/freedomintensifies discusses 9/11</a> 
<a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/2aidbn/cmv_domestic_taxation_implies_governmental/?st=J64VJCD4&amp;sh=75654b20">u/freedomintensifies discusses orbital ring space Elevator </a> </p>

<p>u/closedsociety404 - We then came across an account bearing the hallmarks we&#39;d come to recognise - novel narratives driven by singular facts, varied and deep competencies, eschews the concealment of knowledge etc
Here&#39;s an example, (but again you&#39;ll find a wealth of further reading across their comment history):</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>At the very top of the occult pyramid, yes. However, many people who are involved legitimately do think they are worshipping some entity. For example, there are a lot of myths about aliens creating human life. Often these involve tales that these people came from the Sirius star system or some such. Scientologists have similar stories like planet Xenu. Mormons too.</p>

<p>Where did this stuff come from? Well, suppose you know how to navigate by the stars. If you are devoting mental energy to this, other people will pick up on it. How to conceal your true mental intentions then? Wrap it in very emotionally riveting tales. You look up to Sirius to navigate but you conceal what you are thinking / doing with some fantastical tale about this is where your creator originated or whatever.</p>

<p>Enough of this and in some sense it becomes &quot;real.&quot; People who are exposed to the linguistic keys that lead them to the emotions tied up with Sirius can be overcome with the emotions that swirled around it in the past. It can feel like some other worldly entity moving through you and some people get wrapped up in this with legitimate belief.</p>

<p>Sirius rises in July in Egypt / Israel / Iraq and overlaps with the sun. So the heat of the summer seems to be associated with Sirius - there is less light and heat when Sirius is away from the sun. Can naively seem like a life giver (growing the crops) literally and figuratively (origination myths).</p>

<p>But then you find out that there were active trade routes from America to the Middle East thousands of years ago, that the stars were important for navigation. So you know why the true purpose of Sirius needed to be guarded. And you know better than to think Sirius has anything to do with it getting warm during the summer now - just a cosmic coincidence.</p>

<p>As far as people being in the know, all of that varies tremendously. You can get a small sense of that just from this point. The more you know, the fewer of their myths you can believe. But, if you are fed a lot of semi-truths it is very easy to feel enlightened yet be more lost than when you started.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>After studying the entirety of their comments, cross referencing with the (then active) sessions on /pol, as well as with each other ,we concluded that the OPs of the excerpts  were indeed alts of theHigh Level Insider anon. In my time as a lurker I&#39;ve  seen FBIAnon, HiddenHand etc all ply their trade, with varying degrees of success, but ultimately the verdict was: Larp. The racists and infancy prevent me from engaging too much, but I ride it out as /pol occasionally throws up some  gems. High Level Insider was different from the off. When have you ever seen the maesltrom of shitpost hell be tamed by a guy speaking about <a href="http://archive.4plebs.org/pol/search/text/Jesus%20/username/High%20Level%20Insider/">Jesus </a> and <a href="http://archive.4plebs.org/pol/search/text/Space%20Elevator/username/High%20Level%20Insider/page/2/">Space Elevators </a>? </p>

<p>Deep and wide learning across hard sciences, history, politics, religion is evident throughout the sessions. Answers within seconds of the question being posed, with sessions frequently lasting for hours. I checked details like disparity in time between answer &amp; question, cross referencing  from google, to address the possibility the anon might be fraudulent - but nothing. (I invite you to do the same, perhaps with a different methodology to detect foul play.) </p>

<p>I&#39;ll try and condense the more stand out revelations  into a bloated tldr:</p>

<p>The anon purports to be a member of a benevolent secret society, <a href="http://archive.4plebs.org/pol/search/text/Three%20/username/High%20Level%20Insider/">Three </a>- which counts Jesus, Plato, <a href="http://archive.4plebs.org/pol/search/text/Washington%20/username/High%20Level%20Insider/">Washington </a>, <a href="http://archive.4plebs.org/pol/search/text/JFK%20/username/High%20Level%20Insider/">JFK</a>amongst its members. The<a href="http://archive.4plebs.org/pol/search/text/American%20revolution%20/username/High%20Level%20Insider/">American Revolution </a> was their project to create a republic away from the insidious tendrils of the British- home of global Freemasonry. For thousands of years  they&#39;ve moved in opposition to the oligarchical factions who prey on humanity. </p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The history of the &quot;illuminati&quot; is a great example. It was <a href="http://archive.4plebs.org/pol/search/text/Illuminati%20/username/High%20Level%20Insider/">created by American Revolutionaries </a> as a psy-op to allow the revolution to go forward by creating uncertainty within the ranks of freemasonry as to whether it was a sanctioned event or not.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>Atlantis was real and the place where mankind first rose to learned civility. Following the cataclysm that destroyed global civilisation, consciousness as we know it was lost. Humanity at that time operated under <a href="http://archive.4plebs.org/pol/search/text/Bicameral%20/username/High%20Level%20Insider/">The Bicameral Mind </a>- a mindstate characterised by the division of cognitive functions to seperate parts of the brain - Godbrain (speaking/commands) Servantbrain (listens/obeys).</p>

<p><a href="http://s-f-walker.org.uk/pubsebooks/pdfs/Julian_Jaynes_The_Origin_of_Consciousness.pdf">Origins of Conciousness in the breakdown of the Bicameral Mind-Julian Jaynes </a> is the only book HLI recommends to any who enquire on further reading outside of the sessions. Coherence in consciousness (<em>The Holy Spirit</em>)  is a genuine phenomena and one exploited by the elite against the masses. </p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Consciousness&quot; is a skill wherein people create a mental world analogous to the physical world in order to attempt hypothetical solutions to novel problems. This skill was developed over thousands of years, following the collapse of an earlier system for responding creatively to unique stimuli. This system, dubbed &quot;the Bicameral Mind&quot; involved the right hemisphere of the brain generating solutions and communicating them to the acting left hemisphere using language as the encoding system. As a result, Bicameral individuals &quot;heard&quot; these solutions spoken to them as if from an outside force. </p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>Hypnosis, schizophrenia, possession, are all vestiges of the Bicameral Mind. </p>

<p>The power structures that exist in society today are the result of secret societies that formed as the conscious emerged. Initially meant to preserve awareness, the societies became corrupted by the idea that knowledge should be hidden to rule over the masses. The various factions in Mystery Babylon stem from this central premise:</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Dark priests - these people believe that beauty emerges from contrast. Evil is necessary for good kind of thing. They are not necessarily pro-evil, but pro-contrast.</p>

<p>Kings - generally less intelligent than dark priests. Much of their code of behavior derives from a belief in the past that you need a slave class to sustain an enlightened class.</p>

<p>Meritocracy - they believe in something similar to democratic rule, but only with votes for the initiated, because the masses are hopeless.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>-Humanist elite: </p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Us (Three) - we&#39;re more interested in the emperor without clothes effect. The exercise of power has always come with a stifling of dissent and dangerous dips into psychosis. We try to undermine this tendency more than anything else.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Christianity</strong>
Three follow an esoteric form of Christianity, HLI repeatedly stresses the need for symbolic, not literal, interpretation as the means to truth.</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Christianity itself was our primary attack on the empire. We work primarily through ideas that are compelling enough to spread on their own merit, what you might call meme magic
The elements of the trinity are distinct and each independently meaningful. The holy spirit refers to our collective consciousness. God is real and Jesus was an inspired prophet. Christianity is correct to emphasize the virginal birth and sacrifice. What the virgin birth means is that he rose to consciousness outside of the mystery schools, which laid bare the fraud of them concealing knowledge. His entire life was lived as a sacrifice spreading the truth to ensure that connection to higher consciousness / the godhead would never be the exclusive possession of the corrupted schools. </p>

<p>The essence of Christiandom is two fold, one: to do good, and two: to bring consciousness and enlightenment to all. </p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>Their aim is to bring to about a resurgence of the American system of values, through the unleashing of decades worth of <a href="http://archive.4plebs.org/pol/search/text/technology%20/username/High%20Level%20Insider/">pent up technology </a>. 
Chief amongst this, would be the orbital ring <a href="http://www.orionsarm.com/fm_store/OrbitalRings-I.pdf">Space Elevator </a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;ll illustrate an example using only known, public technology:</p>

<p>Combine an elevator (&gt;ability to run power cables to the ground) with the unlimited real estate in space (&gt;100-1000x concentration power from cheap mirrors) and you can drop power generation costs to about 1/10th of a penny per kWh for something on the order of 18TW of generation (100x reduction in cost of energy supplies) and you have no scaling limitations (until you get several orders of magnitude beyond what we currently use anyway)</p>

<p>All of this can be done with current technology and engineering ability to bring global GDP per capita above $1 million within 10-15 years.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>In earlier sessions when questioned about his group conducting a targeted intervention, HLI states Three will run one of their own for president in <a href="http://archive.4plebs.org/pol/search/text/2024/username/High%20Level%20Insider%20/">2024</a>. </p>

<p>Queries then arose around what form this intervention would take and in what fashion they done so historically:</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We didn&#39;t even control Christianity or Islam. We have throughout history injected big ideas like this and to a lesser extent stories, parables, artistic works, etc., as blunt and imperfect instruments to nudge mankind in the right direction. <strong>It is only in the modern era that we could conceive of programmatic seizure of power with the ability to leverage scientific ability to overcome our inferior numbers.</strong></p>

<p>Our organization is robust, offensively capable, and well-defended already. The current evolving phase is bringing the masses into the fold with a head that cannot be chopped off.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<hr/>

<p><em>Like I said - far fetched, right?</em></p>

<p>If any of this is new to you, your automatic reaction will most likely be mocking disbelief, with a side order of condescension.  Like I said - I&#39;m not asking you to believe me off the bat. It&#39;s not necessary that you believe <em>me</em> at all. I&#39;m simply presenting compelling, albeit radical  information, to a sub known for discussing such things. I&#39;ve linked the sources that have led me to my opinion- take the time to engage with them and in due course you&#39;ll understand why someone would risk the ridicule expected for promotion of such a radical narrative.</p>

<p>Ponder this if you would before forming your response:</p>

<p>If you discussed the vast majority of conspiracies (elite pedophilia, secret societies, Tristate cities, DUMB&#39;s,Archons etc) we research in this sub, with one of your more &#39;bluepilled&#39; friends or family members, what reaction would you likely receiver? Be honest now. Most likely the rolled eyes of mocking disbelief? With a condescending tidbit as their response,</p>

<p>At this stage I&#39;ve digested the entirety of the question sessions, read the recommended book and conducted ancillary research around the topics discussed. </p>

<p>With the help of the user who introduced me to the anon in the first place (s/o u/darkomantis!) I managed to take part in several sessions. Here&#39;s the sole question I had <a href="http://archive.4plebs.org/pol/search/text/Way%20out%20/username/High%20Level%20Insider%20/">answered </a>:</p>

<p>ME</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>HLI- you must understand how difficult it is for those of us who are cynical enough to disputed the accepted narrative, to fully trust an individual making the claims you do. We&#39;ve heard iterations of it before and found the source wanting every time. As concisely as your position permits, please explain why this time is any different? A lifelong dreamer turned Cynic</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>HLI</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If you think back on all the nonsense you have ever read, none of it ever offered you a way out.</p>

<p>You have one in the space elevator alone. You have seen the rise of the middle class in one nation threaten the global order to such an extreme degree that the CIA went on a killing spree across America, rounding up others into institutions, restricting job access, and so on. They are on the brink of failure from only modest economic success. It isn&#39;t so hard to see that unleashing decades of unused technological progress would not only end them but leave you with a radically better world.
And, all of this is verifiable. Crack open some textbooks, learn the physical principles, and see for yourself.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>If this is a LARP, its superior to any I&#39;m familiar with by some orders of magnitude. There are subs and &#39;Fan/LARP&#39; (VOTL,High_Level_Insider) accounts that have sprung up since the anons appearance, all of whom are actively researching and engaging with the source material. </p>

<p>Earlier this year, I penned a post on <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/61hfyi/let_me_explain_exactly_how_trump_is_a_rothschild/">Trump</a>, and another on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/C_S_T/comments/60ufas/cmv_tulsi_gabbard_is_a_member_of_cfr_council_on/?st=J6556H01&amp;sh=b3b82271">Tulsi Gabbard </a> both composed using breadcrumbs given to me by the anon. Both equally necessary to help break the spell bogus politicians have over this community. <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/61hfyi/comment/dffawob?st=J63REDXT&amp;sh=a0180b18">I noticed the anon was active on the thread during the week it was stickied.</a> Again, I can&#39;t attest to the 100% veracity of the anon, more so that I&#39;ve found deception easier to identify when viewed with the aid of their insights. If this equates to truth, then so be it.</p>

<p>They seem to have disappeared for now, both on Reddit and /pol, but the comment histories and archived threads are there still available to view. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll finish with sharing one of the last messages I received from the anon. I&#39;d just read <em>Fingerprints of the Gods</em> and wanted the hear their thoughts on the technological capacity of ancient people. The matter of fact manner they discuss truly reality-expanding concepts, never ceases to amaze me. Hopefully it&#39;s piqued your interest to the extent you&#39;re curious enough to look into this for yourself.</p>

<p>Peace.

<blockquote>
<p>To me the most interesting thing about the ancients is that they had the time to stop and think carefully.
Really there isn&#39;t much remarkable about what we find other than the carefulness of it all. We could talk about how the pyramids were constructed, no magic need be invoked. It isn&#39;t the overwhelming task that it appears.
The truly neat thing about the pyramids is not their scale, it is their precision. That requires high mathematical competency which is very abstract thought. Mathematicians are some of the most careful, precise, considered thinkers on the planet. &gt;&gt;That these existed in droves necessary to do all the astrological work tells you about a society that was living luxurious lives by modern standards.
Even in a &quot;first world&quot; nation like America, half the population is in dire poverty. I think something like 2/3 are paycheck to paycheck, 80% can&#39;t handle an emergency bill of modest size - $5-10k.
You think about these things compared to ancient civilizations that had th time to sit around and work out thousands and thousands of years of astronomical calculations, design temples all around the world, build them, etc., and they seem rich beyond comprehension for most - at least in terms of free time. Who has the free time to build a boat and sail around the world today, never mind the years of designing a temple to build on the other side of the planet, etc.?
All that stuff about the pyramid being some magical power plant or some such is a distraction. Really what it tells you about is the magic of a society organized towards the interest of the people, the magic of living in harmony, and so on. 
The pyramid is remarkable only in the sense of the remarkable fall man has experienced in the intervening period, not so much a remarkable achievement in itself.</p>

<p>I pressed for similar closure when the Trump thread got stickied. </p>

<p>&quot;So when&#39;s the revolution?!</p>

<p>The crux of the response I eventually received was: these things take time. It&#39;s only with the advent of the modern age and the resultant power shift that came with advanced technology, were they able to overtly oppose the regime as opposed to i the covert meme-based warfare they traditionally employ. Across the sessions I get the impression that we&#39;re very much in the midst of a major transition. Events like the procession of the equinox have seemingly converged by chance with the transition of reserve currency status... 
the parasitic cycle of fiat, gold, fiat, gold is due to turn again, as the cabal moves from one host to another. In the absence of any targeted intervention, of Biblical proportions, the American people will be saddled with a debt that can never be paid. </p>

<p>So it seems as good enough time as any for the revolutionaries to begin their stand.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hamilton was a humanist who favored US soveriegnty over foreign dependence.</p>

<p>His &#39;Federalist Papers&#39; put him on the side of the Ionians, Athenians and Spartans in the Pelopanesian war. If I remember correctly, I believe he renounced Aristotle as the Platonic heir, as well. </p>

<p>Of what I have read of his politics (and what little of his economics can be found in the &#39;Federalist Papers&#39;), Hamilton seems in line with the ambitions of Three, an American Republic free of the Old World influence. </p>

<p>As for Washington, it&#39;s confusing. He was a mason of high rank, <em>in order</em> to keep tabs on their movements and spread rumors of the Illuminati penetrating their ranks. As  HLI intimated, the compartmentalization of Mason knowledge allowed for confusion--  fostered by agents of Humanity such as Franklin and Washington-- to run rampant.  </p>

<p>TL;DR: Hamilton was <strong>FOR</strong> the new republic. Washington (and Franklin) were in bed with the enemy to pull the world over their eyes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have never read anything of his referencing the Rothchild&#39;s, but I do believe he was <em>for</em> a central bank, a Nation bank. Also, I was wrong in the comment above. He never mentioned Aristotle.</p>

<p>Hamilton wrote series of reports for George Washington&#39;s administration and for congress starting in 1790. He was the predecessor of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Clay">Henry Clay</a>, whose economics inspired Lincoln.</p>

<p>The First Report of four, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Report_on_the_Public_Credit"><em>Report on Public Credit</em></a> calculated the national debt. His first move was to pay back all of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Report_on_the_Public_Credit#Government_debt_under_the_Articles_of_Confederation">IOU&#39;s the government handed out durring the war</a>. He demanded the government establish good credit with it&#39;s citizens by paying-- with interest-- the face value of the IOU&#39;s. Some corruption ensued, but take the good with the bad, I guess. He used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Report_on_the_Public_Credit#The_political_debate_over_Hamilton.E2.80.99s_.E2.80.9CRedemption.E2.80.9D">ear-marked tariffs</a> to pay down the debt.</p>

<p>The Second Report, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Report_on_Public_Credit#Bank.E2.80.99s_Design.2C_Function_and_Performance">the Report on a National Bank</a> was to be a part-private, part-state run bank. If I understand this correctly, the federal government would pay back the IOU in full, or you could put it in the National Bank at $0.75 on the dollar and watch it grow. Playa&#39;s Choice, if you will...</p>

<p>The Fourth Report, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Report_on_Manufactures">the Report on Manufactures</a> is the one which inspired the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_School_(economics">American System</a>). Essentially, Hamilton wanted to tax the bejeezus out of foreign imports to boost domestic production. ** Warning:: Gross Over-simplification ahead!**</p>

<p><strong>His argument:</strong></p>

<p>America has every resource we need plus 3 million souls who need. Let us harvest here, produce here and sell here. The rest of the world will come to us. The Dutch and Portuguese will pay to sell to us.</p>

<p><strong>Their Argument:</strong></p>

<p>Only the northern states produce! The southern states are farmers! We rely on foreign imports for the luxuries of civilized life!</p>

<p>Hamilton&#39;s viewpoint is stated plainly in the <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/18/pg18-images.html">Federalist Paper 11</a> where he writes:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Suppose, for instance, we had a government in America, capable of excluding Great Britain (with whom we have at present no treaty of commerce) from all our ports; what would be the probable operation of this step upon her politics? Would it not enable us to negotiate, with the fairest prospect of success, for commercial privileges of the most valuable and extensive kind, in the dominions of that kingdom? When these questions have been asked, upon other occasions, they have received a plausible, but not a solid or satisfactory answer. It has been said that prohibitions on our part would produce no change in the system of Britain, because she could prosecute her trade with us through the medium of the Dutch, who would be her immediate customers and paymasters for those articles which were wanted for the supply of our markets. But would not her navigation be materially injured by the loss of the important advantage of being her own carrier in that trade? Would not the principal part of its profits be intercepted by the Dutch, as a compensation for their agency and risk? Would not the mere circumstance of freight occasion a considerable deduction? Would not so circuitous an intercourse facilitate the competitions of other nations, by enhancing the price of British commodities in our markets, and by transferring to other hands the management of this interesting branch of the British commerce?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>TL:DR: Accepting our outrageous tariffs will be the cheapest course of action for a foreign manufacturer.</strong> </p>

<p>The fishy part to me is the claim they needed foreign goods at a reasonable price. W</p>

<p>Spiritual truth. They see the Bible as being almost entirely an allegory, and I don&#39;t. At the very heart of the issue, I don&#39;t believe anyone will go to heaven without repenting and accepting the sacrifice of Jesus Christ for their sins, and they explicitly reject this idea.</p>

<p>That isn&#39;t to say I think they&#39;re bad people. They fight the Mystery Babylon system, which is literally God&#39;s work, and they are not opposed to literal interpretations of Christianity: &quot;whoever is not against us is for us.&quot; (Mark 9:40). </p>

<p>A number of their members, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramon_Llull">Raymond Lull</a>, have taken Christianity pretty literally. Even Hamilton was pretty clearly a conventional Christian, and Washington probably was as well.</p>

<p>Further, I would argue that the mystery religions they follow originally came from Enoch in the Old Testament, who created the Sacred Sciences. The original message was corrupted by the time of the Nephilim, who ruled over the whole earth by these mystery cults. After the flood, Nimrod used mystery religions to again enslave humanity, so God confused their languages and scattered humanity.</p>

<p>According to both the good and evil mystery schools, Freemasonry came from Enoch before the flood. Where HLI gets mixed up is that he doesn&#39;t realize there are two traditions. To my knowledge, author Gary Wayne is the only one to snap to this: in Genesis there is a good Enoch (line of Seth) and an evil Enoch (line of Cain).</p>

<p>So, the story goes, God sent the flood to destroy humanity because he hated them. And the Tower of Babel is about hiding knowledge. What HLI doesn&#39;t know is that he&#39;s getting a corrupted reading of this story, which is prevalent in virtually every single religion besides the writings of Genesis, and probably the Book of Enoch.</p>

<p>The real story is that the evil mystery schools like the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73J4VSOFn-c">Brotherhood of the Snake</a> which were founded by literal human-demon hybrids, had enslaved humanity before the Flood. After the Flood, Nimrod did the same thing (literally a One World Government), so God confused their languages and scattered humanity so they could be free of control by the mystery schools.</p>

<p>It was because the original story was corrupted that God called Abraham out of Babylon. And unlike the other religions, he wrote everything down, so it couldn&#39;t be corrupted by the Mystery Babylon system (only misinterpreted).</p>

<p>It gets even crazier when you consider the possibility that God entrusted these nations to angels who had not fallen in the 1st situation (note Daniel&#39;s references to the demon &quot;Prince of Persia&quot; and Paul&#39;s saying in Ephesians that our battle is against territorial demonic forces), but fell after being given responsibility over nations.</p>

<p>And it reaches its craziest when you recall that HLI referred to his group as &quot;The Watchers.&quot; Same name given to the angels that fell in Genesis 6. </p>

<p>But the Book of Enoch also tells us that many of these fallen angels are repentant, and want to fix the mess they created. Recall also the Greek legends of the Titans (Giants, Nephilim) overthrowing the true God, but then being overthrown themselves by Zeus, who saw how evil they had become.</p>

<p>According to some of the question sessions, Three has been fighting Mystery Babylon since about 800 BC. We&#39;ve been fighting it since well before the Flood.</p>

<p>Spiritual truth. They see the Bible as being almost entirely an allegory, and I don&#39;t. At the very heart of the issue, I don&#39;t believe anyone will go to heaven without repenting and accepting the sacrifice of Jesus Christ for their sins, and they explicitly reject this idea.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is there any particular reason you see the overt narrative culminating in Pauline and following church doctrines being divinely inspired as opposed to every other narrative transmission which becomes warped over time?</p>

<p>I tend to lean toward agreeing with Christ that right action is right doctrine rather than the inverse which tend to be the teachings of &quot;the Church&quot;. Paul I think struggled with this due probably to his religious background and audience.</p>

<p>When it comes to teachings of Christ I find it very difficult to adopt the modern literalist narrative that requires a confession of faith to secure a place in the afterlife. His teaching is not a universalist one, but he very clearly in multiple instances makes it clear that his path is one of right action not right belief. What&#39;s beautiful about this is how it works whether the Kingdom of God is meant to be made manifest now or to be experienced in fullness after death.</p>

<p>All that being said, if you&#39;re loving God and your neighbor I embrace you as a brother and hope to bring the Kingdom in with you. Just curious as to how you got to the place you are and if it&#39;s something I hadn&#39;t considered.</p>

<p>For one thing, Paul was brutally killed for these beliefs, like the rest of the disciples. Sheeple will die for made-up religions, but not the founders.</p>

<p>Secondly, there is fulfilled prophecy. Look into the dozens of prophecies about Jesus that he fulfilled, or look into how Bible prophecy is being fulfilled right now, like how Israel was regathered from the 4 corners of the earth back to their land.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The most important part is actually repentance; turning from a life of evil. Imagine if God let unrepentant evil psychopaths into Heaven; it wouldn&#39;t be Heaven at all. You simply can&#39;t have a positive afterlife without a prerequisite of repentance.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Sure, this is why the book of James is in the Bible, to counteract libertinism (&quot;sin it up, Jesus already paid the tab!&quot;). Real repentance will lead to good deeds.</p>

<p>Yes. The followers of Jesus Christ. The true followers of the Hebrew religion. Those that listened to Noah&#39;s preaching after the flood. Those that followed Enoch&#39;s preaching before the flood.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re interested, there&#39;s a really interesting book called &quot;Eternity in their Hearts&quot; that shows that many religions are essentially telling the same thing if you go back far enough. This belief was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Praeparatio_Evangelica">widespread</a>  in the early church, but modern Christians teach that anything except Evangelical Christianity is terrible and must be denounced.</p>

<p>For example, many pagan religions believe in an ultimate creator God, which is exactly what the Bible teaches: lots of lesser spiritual powers (angels) and an ultimate one (God).</p>

<p>It&#39;s likely that many of these old religions were founded by Enoch and Noah, and subsequently corrupted. </p>

<p>This is, at best, a probabilistic argument, and a terribly weak one (people who believe in biblical literalism are so prone to make mistakes that you should be suspicious of this person on the sole basis that they believe in literalism). If he were a flat earther, you might have an argument, but we&#39;re talking about finer points of theology, not something you can debunk in 10 minutes.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re saying biblical literalism, is, per se, grounds for being suspicious of someone&#39;s views, then I would say you need to read The Origin of Consciousness again. This is essentially shutting off one&#39;s consciousness to the claims of someone outside of your tribe.</p>

<p>Every argument that a person makes should be evaluated on its own merit, including whether literal interpretation of the Bible is correct. Have you actually investigated that personally, or are you assuming High Level Insider is correct about that matter without confirming it yourself?</p>

<p>That sounds about right. Turn science into pure empiricism, reasoning from the observations, rather than operating from a sense of a deeper truth.</p>

<p>At a very basic level, most societies didn&#39;t even consider the Creator to be rational, so why would you go looking for natural laws that you can understand? In other words, most societies are philosophically incapable of science.</p>

<p>Can confirm. They simply <a href="https://archive.4plebs.org/pol/thread/106651502/#q106668296">speak with people</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The ability to speak freely is not something most people have encountered in person and it really shocks them to bump into it. I&#39;ve repeatedly struck up conversations with strangers and had them tell me I am going to save the world within five minutes. That&#39;s an overblown analysis on their part, but it speaks to the intensity with which an encounter with freedom resonates with people. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In my understanding, OBL was a real person from Saudi Arabia, who was a CIA asset during the Afghanistan vs Russia war. He was trained and funded by the CIA as a proxy army against Russia, like we&#39;ve seen them do many times. He was a well known figure after that, so when he died in 2001, it was a perfect opportunity to use his likeness to blame on 9/11. Bill Cooper even called this almost a year before 9/11, and specifically mentioned OBL. </p>

<p>Essentially, less work would have to be done to get a bogeyman known by people from the middle East and the west. Since Barack Obama was a CIA asset too, along with his family, and the fact that he was fluent in Arabic, dark skinned, intelligent, etc, he was a perfect candidate to play the role. So perfect, that barely anyone knows it, and people mock you if you even suggest it. </p>

<p>Then you can dig deeper in Wayne Madsen&#39;s <a href="https://www.lewrockwell.com/2010/09/wayne-madsen/the-story-of-obama-allinthecompany/">work</a>, and see his whole family is CIA for generations. Do a little work on his timeline during the 1980s, like meeting up with the head of Operation Cyclone, Brzezinski, at Columbia, and it gets to be pretty plausible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not really. if you can tell me what part i misrepresented i&#39;d be happy to approach it. But you didn&#39;t and you can&#39;t because that was literally his argument. Sure, i can go down searching thousands of links through the sources he just provided. But when it starts off with &quot; oh he looked like him...and went to school with berzinski... and worked at a place where cia worked before... not much of an argument.</p>

<p>&quot;The theory has legs once you remove yourself from the stunned disbelief that TPTB could ever do something so wild..&quot;</p>

<p>your first mistake is assuming i don&#39;t think they&#39;d do it. I think they&#39;d do it and more. but you have no argument or source and likely since you&#39;re pumping this HLI guy so hard, you&#39;re more likely to be a part of (or at least fallen victim to) more larping or bogus conspiracy shit like the flat earth campaign that is just to muddy the waters and make conspiracies seem that much more retarded. I mean if you are so damn sure about it, at least like HLI is who you seem to believe...then it shouldn&#39;t be hard to source something that isn&#39;t tangential proof full of holes.</p>

<p>ps. i do think he&#39;s CIA for what it&#39;s worth. just not osama lol</p>

<p>This is where you lose me I&#39;m afraid. I&#39;m no &#39;flattie&#39; - although your false equivalence doesn&#39;t go unnoticed. For the reasons I listed, I don&#39;t think the idea Obama at one point played Osama as part of his CIA role, isn&#39;t so outlandish a theory. You&#39;re aware that the vast majority of the public would greet your notion that Obama was CIA, with the same incredulousness as you have for the theory he played Obama? </p>

<p>Discounting an idea as madness without doing the diligence necessary to offer an informed opinion, is materially similar to accepting it as gospel. </p>

<p>But your opinion is welcome nonetheless my man. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cool. Not really a false equivalence but ok. I haven&#39;t had time to look at your sources but i&#39;ll give them a go.</p>

<p>&quot;I don&#39;t think the idea Obama at one point played Osama as part of his CIA role, isn&#39;t so outlandish a theory.&quot;</p>

<p>i don&#39;t think it&#39;s too outlandish either. I even am inclined to believe it more than i think you believe i am. I just don&#39;t blindly assert things because they sound good or because i want them to be true.</p>

<p>&quot;Discounting an idea as madness without doing the diligence necessary to offer an informed opinion, is materially indistinguishable to accepting it as gospel.&quot;</p>

<p>i agree. which is what many seem do be doing with the HLI guy. Which is why i pointed out the Osama thing because it&#39;s just taken as gospel the way he asserts it without any reasoning or proof. So since you support that guy you are essentially condoning that type action that you detest. That was my point really. i don&#39;t really want to argue about the facts. i ask for sources for my own research not to argue at this point. </p>

<p>And i get you&#39;re more analyzing what he says and you don&#39;t have to defend him on every issue. that&#39;s fair. I was interested in him and he lost me at that point. I asked him for clarification but was never given any.</p>

<p>Anyone with a brain stopped reading here, and instantly realized you&#39;re a bullshitter. &quot;Oh, I could look at evidence, but who needs that when I can lie and pretend facts don&#39;t exist?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;19. Ignore proof presented, demand impossible proofs. This is perhaps a variant of the “play dumb” rule. Regardless of what material may be presented by an opponent in public forums, claim the material irrelevant and demand proof that is impossible for the opponent to come by (it may exist, but not be at his disposal, or it may be something which is known to be safely destroyed or withheld, such as a murder weapon). In order to completely avoid discussing issues may require you to categorically deny and be critical of media or books as valid sources, deny that witnesses are acceptable, or even deny that statements made by government or other authorities have any meaning or relevance.&quot;</p>

<p>We know the official story stinks to high heaven - dead seal teams, body thrown in the sea like Megatron..</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/altered-appearance-for-osama/">Remember how frequently he changed appearance.. </a> </p>

<p><a href="https://nsnbc.wordpress.com/2012/05/20/bin-laden-died-of-natural-causes-former-cia-agent/">and the reports he died of natural causes 5 years before Obama &quot;killed him&quot;</a> </p>

<p>I&#39;m not 100% Obama is Osama. But I do know Obama is legacy CIA. Brzezinski is the common denominator between the two. Against a backdrop like that, HLIs claim doesn&#39;t seem all that unlikely. Incredibly fantastic within our current world view, yes but not impossible.</p>

<p>I&#39;d argue the official theory is even more implausible. </p>

<p>They broadcast Gaddafi and Saddam being sodomised with knives and murdered on live TV... yet Bin Lade, the alleged mastermind of the whole affair, gets thrown in the sea &quot;in accordance with Islamic law&quot;. </p>

<p>I wish I knew someone who spoke Aramish (biblical language) to confirm this:</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Most people are less aware that Obama / Osama is related to the book of Revelation, that his name translates as Lightning from Heaven in Aramaic (when Jesus said I perceived satan as lightning from heaven what he spoke would be very, very close to &quot;barack o bama&quot;), etc. There are many many layers to the deception as is usually the case.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great post! If I I could upvote this a thousand times, I would. The HLI changed me for the better. After reading his AMA&#39;S, as well as the Julian Jaynes book, I have a vastly different mindset. Whether he&#39;s a LARP or not is irrelevant to me at this point, but I think he&#39;s the real deal. </p>

<p>Also, there was an account here going by his moniker that recommended another book to me, which was Manly P Hall&#39;s &#39;The Secret Teaching Of All Ages&#39;. It has given me alot of insight into secret societies, what they do, how they&#39;re formed, societies within societies, etc. </p>

<p>I hope he does another question session soon. He said they&#39;d continue for years to come, but has been on a hiatus since early March. </p>

<p>Did you read their comment? Outstanding dialectic method.. 
if you scroll back to the start of their comment history, they&#39;re engaged in a <em>tit-a-tat</em>&#39;with Robert David Steele during his AMA on r/conspiracy - watching a CIA spook get decimated by the anon was one of the ways we flagged him.. </p>

<p>I&#39;m too cynical to believe that anything can be done about the current state of the world; save for massive natural disasters, thermonuclear war, or worldwide civilian uprisings.  I feel that people promising hope and an answer in times like these, with seemingly inside information, are either mocking us from on high or are trying to lul us into a false sense of security.</p>

<p>The thought has crossed my mind, in fact you&#39;ll see me express something very similar in the latter part of the post..</p>

<p>But what if they&#39;re not?</p>

<p>We&#39;re hardwired to believe in &quot;what ifs?&quot;.  And for good reason.</p>

<p>What if I go over the lake, what then?
What if we land a man on the moon, how would we go about doing that?
What if we built a space Elevator?</p>

<p>&quot;What ifs&quot; represent  potential to create opportunity where a gulf formerly existed. Is that not our god given power to create? TPTB have done an admirable job in convincing us we lack the ability to create ourselves and must depend on them for sustenance. What Three and HLI represent is really just a return to the essence of what makes us human- the ability to shape our world in accordance with our desires. As opposed to shaping the world <em>in accordance with their desires</em>.</p>

<p>I see no logical reason for TPTB to execute such a ploy in a time when they can whittle down presidential candidates to Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. There seems little value of running a psyop on the livestocks to give them the illusion of free range living.</p>

<p>I think what sold me on him was the fact that he presented solutions. &quot;Run surveillance on elites. Acquire agency. Break the Overton window. Build a space elevator.&quot;</p>

<p>I&#39;ve read the Jaynes book but I&#39;m still trying to pin down what he means when he talks about consciousness. The closest definition he gave was to be able to perceive the interconnectedness of minds. Have you or anybody else made any progress on how to achieve it?  I&#39;ve found some leads that I&#39;d be happy to share but I&#39;m curious to see if anybody else has learned anything.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Space Elevator is a means to launch payloads into  LEO (lower earth orbit) at a fraction of the cost than we can presently. At this altitude, space based solar arrays can be constructed to harness luminosity unencumbered by the barrier of atmosphere. The resultant energy acquired would be enough to increase the throughput of the world, increasing global GDP (wealth) and opening the way for future initiatives. My further education isn&#39;t  grounded science based, but a cursory glance at history will tell you how many of earths problems are remedied with the introduction of more energy. Cheaper, more abundant, clean energy is the transformative quality that will propel mankind into a new age.  I&#39;m not aware of any symbology mentioned alongside the Space Elevator, that&#39;s not to say there isn&#39;t however.</p>
