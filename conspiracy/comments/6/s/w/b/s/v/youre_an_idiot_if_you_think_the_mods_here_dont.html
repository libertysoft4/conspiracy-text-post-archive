    <div class="md"><p>I can answer that, it happened a few months before the end of the election. </p>

<p>I used to post here a good bit and then the election ramped up, Trump was the winner of the Republicans National Convention and Hillary the winner of the DNC and things went to complete hell. </p>

<p>There was an inarguable shift in not only what was heavily pushed in this sub but also what political bias it took. This sub has always delved into politics but never before had it been so inarguably pushing one side over another. It was subtle at first and less noticed but as time went on it only got worse and worse. If you supported one side or another you were a shill (no matter of side) if you didn&#39;t believe either side you were a shill in disguise. There was no winning. No matter where you stood you were inevitably going to be accused of supporting one side or another. You couldn&#39;t say a single thing about either candidate without being accused of supporting whichever side you weren&#39;t referring to at the time. If you called out Hillary you supported Trump. Called out Trump you supported Hillary. Those in the middle we&#39;re not allowed to stay in such, at least according to people&#39;s perceptions. </p>

<p>This election split people so much that everyone felt on edge. Which led to finger pointing on all sides. Tie that in with the rise of bot accounts and clear agendas on display across all of Reddit and people were only split more. </p>

<p>It didn&#39;t help that Reddit as a whole has allowed covert advertisements. Which led to a group of people already keeping an eye on all things and taking a questionative stance towards things to be even more speculative of what they were seeing because what many considered relevant post were getting removed/brigaded/down voted etc. Because no matter the side if you saw a post they didn&#39;t support your side it was an attack.</p>

<p>This sub, simply put, splintered because people who all agreed they were for conspiracies started playing political games. Believing their side was right and the other wrong. Not everyone, but enough. And many saw this for what it was the clear cut establishment attempting to pit two sides against one another. Sadly those that have attempted to call this out were ignored. And now it may be to late. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Which side do you believe is being pushed?  Because it looks to me like both sides are shilling pretty regularly, and that the mods are generally pretty fair (and I&#39;ve had a number of run ins with them).  I would say that the CA shills are more regular but less obnoxious, while SB tends to focus on brigading top threads.  Both sides are equally annoying, but how do you filter out shills without catching a whole bunch of genuine users in the process?</p>

<p>Personally, I think Trump is an awful president, and I&#39;m really glad he beat Hillary.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly, at first I thought &quot;just get rid of the shills, goddamnit&quot;, but after talking with some mods about it I realized that I didn&#39;t have any better ideas about how to identify them properly.

<p>My personal suggestion is to put every single post in contest mode for 24 hours. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My view on banning shills.</p>

<p>You&#39;re going to accidentally ban some innocent people.  Don&#39;t fret because they will appeal in modmail and it&#39;s usually pretty easy to tell if you made a mistake based on how they react to being banned.  There is another layer of mistakes that can be made there also.  Regardless, just ban them and if it seem you made a mistake it&#39;s really easy to unban them.</p>

<p>Contest mode is a bandaid IMHO.  It might help some wounds heal but if it&#39;s too deep then you&#39;re just creating an environment for infection to fester.</p>

<p>You said CA shills were less obnoxious. I tend to agree but I&#39;m curious if for similar reasons or not.  I think they are less obnoxious because they tend to blend in better here, they tend to also subscribe to other Conspiracy Theories that aren&#39;t Trump related.  I think SB is only really interested in ONE theory so they tend to shit on just about everything else that is frequently discussed here.  </p>

<p>To simplify things CA will consider (or act like it) most conspiracies except for one, obviously that one being that Trump is some flavor of bad.  Whereas SB will only consider one Conspiracy and they make fine Conspiracy theorists as long as the subject is Trump, anything else and the obnoxious vibe is dominant.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s a fair litmus test, because I don&#39;t know what your criteria are when you say &#39;based on how they react to being banned&#39;.  I mean, in the past I&#39;ve been known to lose my temper and be a real dick to mods when I thought I was being unfairly treated.  So, I stayed banned in those subs.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m still not sure what the objection to contest mode is.  It&#39;s obviously not a cure all, but it&#39;s certainly better than what is currently happening, and it seems like it would discourage, if not prevent brigadeing.  </p>

<p>On CA vs SB shills:</p>

<p>I think that a lot of the people who get identified at CA shills are actually just genuine Trump supporters.  They&#39;re definitely pushing a narrative and trying to shape the dialogue, but I can&#39;t help but feel that it&#39;s more organic.  They may be (are) stupid as shit, but they&#39;re pushing a narrative based on belief, rather than because somebody is paying them.  I&#39;m sure there are some number of actual paid CA shills, but they blend into the general idiocy associated with <a href="/r/the_donald">/r/the_donald</a>, and don&#39;t really stand out most of the time.</p>

<p>I think ShareBlue feels different because they simply don&#39;t have that kind of organic support.  Not too many people actually like or trust the DNC.  When SB is brigading it&#39;s more of a &#39;here&#39;s our latest talking point, obey!&#39; feel.  SB&#39;s approach to shilling seems to be more of the &#39;shock and awe&#39; variety.  They push obvious bullshit (WaPo at the top of conspiracy?) articles to the top fast, hijack the top comment chain, and absolutely smash anybody who questions the narrative with downvotes (or sometimes multiple accounts just start attacking comments simultaneously).  They also tend to hijack the top comment on every political thread and shit all over conspiracies in general.  I just find that style of shillery much more annoying, although I&#39;m not sure I would say it&#39;s objectively worse.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I regularly ban people from Conspiracy for shitting on the Conspiracy subreddit.</p>

<p>There are plenty of people here who speak out against my political ideology who aren&#39;t at any risk of being banned.  If people of certain political ideologies are incapable of speaking out without breaking the rules here, it&#39;s not my problem and I&#39;m not going to avoid banning them because of your false perception of why they got banned.</p>

<p>It&#39;s funny really, we have people come in here calling everyone retarded or trumptards or cucks or libtards and as soon as they get banned they all scream at us in modmail</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I WAS BANNED FOR MY POLITICAL VIEWS!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sorry bud but your blatant disregard for our rules is why you got banned.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been accused of being cucked, of being &quot;trumptarded&quot; (probably am) of being a Jew of being a Nazi of being a shareblue employee and even a Cambridge Analytica employee.  All because some hyperventilating user got banned because they refuse the follow the rules.</p>

<p>You probably dont even understand what my political views are.  I&#39;m not a republican, I do Support Trump but probably not for the reasons you would assume.  I would support single payer health care, but not while we have mass immigration and shitty boarder controls.  I don&#39;t support war but I&#39;m also not a pacifist.  All these issues aren&#39;t as black and white as the 2 party fraud would like you to believe.  I&#39;m not anti-abortion but I think there needs to be reasonable limits on it.  </p>

In the spirit of Moderator Transparency, I&#39;m sure you&#39;d agree that would help address many concerns.</p>

<p>Also, please answer the following two questions to the best of your knowledge:</p>

<p>1) Do you or the other mods makes notes about specific users in a private wiki, IRC, or chat service?</p>

<p>2) Have you or the other mods privately discussed using this sub to set up honeypots for the purpose of collecting or tracking user IP addresses?</p>

<p>The pattern that would emerge is this,</p>

<p>Users who don&#39;t participate in any Conspiracy discussion are judged more harshly by me as well as extremely young accounts, extremely aggressive accounts and in general people who can&#39;t follow the rules.</p>

<p>We aren&#39;t required to give people warnings and council them endlessly before we ban them so I usually reserve warnings for people who have demonstrated that they CAN have a civil conversation/debate in the past but are maybe just having a bad day.  </p>

<h1><a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/09/22/palmer-luckey-the-facebook-billionaire-secretly-funding-trump-s-meme-machine.html">Palmer Luckey: The Facebook Near-Billionaire Secretly Funding Trump’s Meme Machine</a></h1>

<blockquote>
<p>“We conquered Reddit and drive narrative on social media, conquered the [mainstream media], now it’s time to get our most delicious memes in front of Americans whether they like it or not,” a representative for the group wrote in an introductory post on Reddit.</p>

<p>Palmer Luckey—founder of Oculus—is funding a Trump group that circulates dirty memes about Hillary Clinton.</p>

<p>“I’ve got plenty of money,” Luckey added. “Money is not my issue. I thought it sounded like a real jolly good time.”</p>

<p>But in another post written under Luckey’s Reddit pseudonym, there are echoes of a similar tech billionaire, Peter Thiel [<a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/02/donald-trump-has-made-peter-thiel-immensely-powerful">&quot;Notorious tech billionaire Peter Thiel, a key Trump transition advisor&quot;</a> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/07/who-is-peter-thiel-rnc-2016-trump/492380/">&quot;express doubts over whether it was a good idea to give women the right to vote&quot;</a>]</p>

<p>Before becoming directly involved in the process, Luckey met the man who would serve as the liaison for the nascent political action group, and provide legitimacy to a Reddit audience for later donations without having to reveal Luckey’s identity: Breitbart tech editor and Trump booster Milo Yiannopoulos. The bleached-blonde political agitator is most notable for being permanently suspended from Twitter for harassment after a series of abusive messages to actress Leslie Jones.</p>

<p>Luckey first met the alt-right provocateur in Los Angeles about a year and a half ago, before Yiannopoulos began working on a charity to send white men to college. The Daily Beast later reported that the scholarship fund had resulted in zero financial distribution of the donations that had been made directly to Yiannopoulos’s bank account.</p>

<p>“I came into touch with them over Facebook,” Luckey said of the band of trolls behind the operation. “It went along the lines of ‘hey, I have a bunch of money. I would love to see more of this stuff.’” </p>

    <div class="md"><p>i dunno, police give out info on how to identify suspicious persons</p>

<p>im just wondering if your Shill Identifying Methodology is something like: Liberal Viewpoint/disbelieve pizzagate/believe seth rich was not murdered by dnc assasins: Shareblue shill</p>

<p>Love trump/loves pizzagate/knows seth was murdered by dnc assassins: CA Shill</p>

<p>the way I identify what I think are shills (since it cannot be confirmed I have no idea how accurate I am) is people who do things like question facts in a manner that is meant to make it seem like the facts are wrong, but they arent interested in the answer, because they keep doing the same thing elsewhere in the thread and other threads</p>

<p>Or they post a ton of articles all with one viewpoint/agenda, especially ones with questionable sources or with titles that are meant mislead in the title. This is effective for shills because a lot of people just scan the title, take what they want, and move on without reading the content or digging deeper</p>

<p>or if i notice talking points with similar verbiage coming from different accounts, or a ton of repetition in posts</p>

<p>examples like &quot;putin is a saint&quot; or re: wikileaks &quot;100% track record&quot; followed by stat of how many documents without a single fake. when multiple accounts do this in multiple contexts i get suspicious</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I appreciate your point, but you destroyed yourself with hypocrisy in the last paragraph.  </p>

<p>You have taken your stance and you believe your side is right and the other side is wrong. You are practicing distorted skepticism. Obviously, what you say has been true for decades. But the truly skeptical position would allow for the possibility that the current administration is trying to force the establishment to change for the better. For that matter, any new administration <em>could</em> be different from previous administrations. We don&#39;t have to consider this likely, but the skeptical position would allow for the possibility that change could happen from within. People who say otherwise are scared to see what would happen.</p>

<p>If you want to understand the true source of the division in this subreddit, it&#39;s important to give sufficient attention to the people that just won&#39;t let Trump supporters have their theories. They will respect our rules, and if they are wrong they will admit it in the end. Meanwhile, nobody can really prove that they are wrong. Maybe Trump knows more than he lets on and he has a plan to destroy the Deep State. Maybe you think that&#39;s ridiculous. Maybe it&#39;s okay to have people that think both things simultaneously in this subreddit. But it&#39;s not okay to continuously harass and bully people for their beliefs. It&#39;s not okay to show up in every thread with a topic you have a pet hatred for and bully and harass everyone. It&#39;s not okay to cry &quot;The_Donald2.0&quot; in every thread that dares to suggest that Trump is not a sexist idiot Cheeto.  </p>

<p>We can talk about Russian collusion. We can talk about Seth Rich. We can talk about time travel. We can talk about aliens. We can talk about Hillary Clinton covering up health problems. We can talk about Bigfoot. We can talk about anything. If you don&#39;t see a submission about topics that interest you, then get involved and change that. On the other hand, if you see topics that you only want to shit all over, kindly hide the post (downvote if you must) and move on with your day, or else deal with the fact that you look like a shill or an asshole.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In principle it&#39;s not, but when it always appears in the context of the never ending quest to equate Donald Trump with the establishment, then yes it is taking a side.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sorry, but sticking your head in the sand and believing you haven&#39;t chosen a side doesn&#39;t change reality. You say the reason we are caught up in political discussion is because the establishment wants us divided. That is a positive claim which carries the implication that neither side of the political argument is right and both are being manipulated. This is a belief, not a fact, and whether or not it is true can change over time. It is possible that there is a legitimate political debate happening now with serious implications for topics which conspiracy theorists have debated for decades, in which case it would be reasonable for us to discuss what is happening. But now that the Deep State conspiracy is finally coming out in the mainstream, we have you and others like you here to tell us we should hush up and stop playing politics. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, the only one pushing an agenda here is you. I simply was stating what happened to this sub. You are the one making this something it&#39;s not. </p>

<p>Once again, the establishment wanting to divide us is not a statement in question it is a fact. I&#39;m not saying who that establishment is. I&#39;m not, as you&#39;ve insinuated saying &quot;deep state&quot; nor am I saying &quot;Donald Trump&#39;s or Hillary Clinton&quot;. You can&#39;t see that as you&#39;ve clearly drawn an idiological line here. That&#39;s fine. That&#39;s a fine stance to have, as long as you aren&#39;t allowing such to cloud your cognitive thinking and are allowing yourself to view all sides of a situation/statement/position equally. </p>

<p>Sadly though the above mentioned idiological stance is very rare if not outright impossible because embracing an idiological side, one way or another, is going to inadvertently lead to a bias, whether conciously or not, and in discussions as polarizing as some in this sub those bias are more than likely going to arise. And that my friend is why you won&#39;t see me taking a stance one way or another along this left/right divide in this here discussion. I&#39;m not trying to push whatever stance I may have into my discussion here, as what I believe regarding such isn&#39;t important to a discussion of what happened to this sub and how it happened. </p>

<p>I have a side. I have a lens that I view the world through. But I try to keep in mind that I could be wrong. And I don&#39;t shit on people for having an opinion. It&#39;s not really political for me. I&#39;ve voted on both sides and sworn off both parties in disgust. But I thought Bernie was enough of an outsider and an honorable person so I supported him. That&#39;s when I feel I saw behind the curtain of deceit put up by the DNC. I was registered democrat but I felt there were things happening in Reddit and elsewhere that could not be ignored.</p>

<p>Bernie supporters and trump supporters both brought enormous passion to supporting their candidate. Hillary supporters have always seemed to convey mostly hostility for people that support someone else. </p>

<p>Maybe Trump has his own corruption. That would be a reasonable consideration. But I think it would be such a monumental difference in scale that it&#39;s hard to take it that seriously some times when I feel there are clear crimes being ignored on the other side. Plus Trump really is the conspiracy president. It would make sense to support a 9/11 questioning, vaccine skeptical politician.</p>

<p>Ah, yes. I forget that facts are subjective this day and age.

<p>Politics and conspiracy are inextricably linked, if you remove poliyics this sub is dead.</p>

<p>Nevermind the fact to begin with the justification for this kind of massive mod intervention is flimsy at best. All they&#39;ve been able to offet is phony controversies as a pretext to institute more and more rules.</p>

<p>Or shills and botting. Or both. Hard to tell.</p>

<p>I actually think that <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> occasionally hits on some real shit that the powers that be definitely don&#39;t want discussed because they have seen that this place can be an incubator for ideas that really take off and spread.</p>

<p>If you look at where we have seen drastic media manipulation, both legacy and new media, it really is coming mostly from one side. Google, Facebook, YouTube, and Reddit all have been massively manipulated and there is no reason to think this is any different.</p>

<p>Media manipulation by the DNC, and arguably the deep state as well, during the 2016 election made me a conspiracy theorist and went a long way toward turning me into a reluctant trump supporter. I used to dismiss pretty much all conspiracies out of hand and I used to go spend time downvoting every post on the_donald because I hated trump and hated the culture of that sub even more.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong, I&#39;m no fan of the Republican Party in general and neocons can all go die but I really think what is happening on the left is monumental.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Could this be because of my post trying to raise awareness for exposing the New World Order? </p>

<p>Pretty much nearly everyone agreed with that sentiment. It had 1.k upvotes and an immediate positive reaction from the community right upon posting. Was it aggressive? Potentially. But I felt I had to get a message across. I think what we&#39;re seeing is going to be a ban of all NWO or one world government related discussion, under the guise of it being &quot;political discussion&quot;.</p>

<p>I never called for anything or any topics to be banned in my OP. That would be unfair, I don&#39;t believe in banning any free discussion, however, I raised a good point that perhaps we should focus on the EVIDENCE BACKED conspiracies, and maybe stray away from the Pandora&#39;s box (Bigfoot, flat earth, conspiracies that have very little provable evidence to them).</p>

<p>Even if Bigfoot or flat earth were real, there&#39;s WAY more evidence pointing to the existence of a group of Ruling elite who dominate the social and political realm. Why not allocate our resources and focus to where we can wake people up?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I personally couldn&#39;t agree more. I think anyone who posts here should also crosspost to their own sub to filter it away from the swamp of nonsense content that is taking over more and more of this sub. In particular I think <a href="/u/polkadotgirl">/u/polkadotgirl</a> should do this. </p>

<p>Although I guess on futher inspection, she did do exactly that 5 days ago! Right here: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracyundone/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracyundone/</a></p>

<p>Seriously, reddit is a gift because anyone can become their own media station. We should use it to its full power, and everyone who has ideas worth spreading should make their own sub, even if they just post once a month or whatever. It really doesn&#39;t matter, there&#39;s nothing to lose by starting a subreddit, and there&#39;s no harm in crossposting a good post around to a few different subs. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve been kind of blown away by how much <a href="/r/magnora7">/r/magnora7</a> has grown, I never expected it to get beyond a few hundred people. But it&#39;s clear a lot of people on reddit who are branching out and looking for quality sources and quality subs. Those with quality things to say should do humanity a favor and put their ideas out there! To me this is how we grow as a species, by keeping important ideas alive and prominent in our minds. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Depends on if you&#39;re trying to build a community-based subreddit (in which case a subject-based subreddit name might be better) or more a subreddit focused on the writing of one person is better.

    <div class="md"><p>Somehow, something tells me that the current mod fiasco is being well received by the inorganic posters here. There seems to have been a great effort to turn conspiracy into a madhouse that nobody would trust for serious discussion. That alone is why I dont bother to post here. </p>

<p>At this point I would say that the average lurker has lost all faith in this sub and its moderators. We stay away from any posts because we can see the hyperpartisanship and inauthentic discussion. </p>

<p>While I have more than a few ideas to help sort this mess out the truth is that change of a positive sort isnt likely to come around any time soon without some deep introspection by the mod team. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve said it before in another thread and I&#39;m going to say again. </p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6slxvz/fbi_conducted_predawn_raid_of_former_trump/">this thread about the FBI raiding Paul Manafort&#39;s house</a> there were 3 users who between the 3 of them had well over 100 comments. There&#39;s 800 comments there now but yesterday I counted them having over 100 when the thread was only at around 500 comments.</p>

<p>MAGABolt, psyderr, and peyote_the_coyote. </p>

<p>Why are 3 accounts making up 10-20% of an entire comment section?</p>

<p>Either they knew it was going to be put into contest mode, or their goal was to post so much nonsense that it would sway the mod&#39;s  to make the decision to put the thread in contest mode. </p>

<p>MAGABolt in particular is suspicious, due to him being banned and then unbanned immediately after. Which could be seen in the public modlogs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. I feel 9-11 as an inside job has been thoroughly debunked and claims that it is impossible for planes to bring down the towers relies on a misunderstanding of engineering and physics. However I do feel there is much more that is worth investigating in terms of Saudi support for the hijackers.</p>

<p>My concern is that if we allow people to post about debunked theories jet fuel and steel beams, we&#39;re on a slippery slope to having to allow flat earthers to post there. </p>

<p>I feel this would detract from the discussion about much more plausible conspiracy theories, and there are plenty of much larger subreddits that encourage discussion about theories relating to 9-11 being an inside job.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A lot of evidence has been indepently reviewed by thousands of independent engineers, and save for a handful of architects (who are not as qualified to judge structural integrity) the overwhelming consensus is that thermal expansion caused structural integrity to fail in wtc7, which caused floors to fall and expose those below them to dynamic loads outside of their designed capacity. </p>

<p>Maybe an entire industry and academic discipline is all in cahoots to cover this up. But considering the fact that engineers are generally pretty reactive to credible evidence, I find this unlikely. </p>

<p>For example, it took a single letter from a single student who presented credible, mathematical evidence that the <a href="http://99percentinvisible.org/episode/structural-integrity/">Citicorp center could collapse in high winds from a certain direction</a> to order and entire retrofit of the building.</p>

<p>You do not have to agree with this, but until there is more credible evidence of some type of controlled demolition or coverup, I&#39;m going to have to judge this to be just as debunked as faking the Sandyhook shooting or Apollo 11. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>Absolutely agree with you 100% on that one. Particularly considering the government managed to convince a majority of Americans that Iraq had WMD&#39;s (which weren&#39;t in the country), and that Al Queda was in Iraq (which they weren&#39;t, at least until a few years after we showed up and created a massive power and labor vacuum through de-Baathification).</p>

<p>Even on the 9-11 front I still believe there are questions that need to be answered on the role of the Saud&#39;s and their possible state sponsored, covert support for the attackers. But right now I find it extremely implausible that there was active or passive support from the US government in the attack.</p>

<p>If new information is made available that suggests otherwise, I&#39;ll be the first to issue a public apology to every user like you who tried to convince me otherwise and it will be moved immediately to our list of encouraged topics.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I completely understand if our focus isn&#39;t your cup of tea. But I personally feel that a serious discussion about highly plausible conspiracies either gets lost to political bickering, or is crowded out by posts like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6syq3j/the_earth_is_growing_pangea_was_not_a_lopsided/">this one on the front page arguing in favor of Aether.</a></p>

<p>Personally feel that keeping an open mind to the disproved concept of Aether is like searching for mathematical truth be constantly considering the fact that 2+2 could equal five and never bringing yourself to the conclusion the it actually equals 4.</p>

<p>If new evidence comes to light about a controlled demolition or nefarious government cover up (or aether for that matter) I&#39;ll be the first to issue a public apology and move it to our encouraged topics list, but in the mean time I feel that heavily debunked, and highly improbable theories are outside the scope of <a href="/r/ConspiracyHypothesis">/r/ConspiracyHypothesis</a> and a better fit for some of the many other conspiracy subreddits.</p>

<p>On that same note, while Trump-Russia has been a major focus due to the fact that new information seems to come out so regularly, if credible evidence is presented that this really is a &quot;nothing burger&quot; it will be moved to our prohibited topics list. There are plenty of other topics from Crimea, to Syria, to Net Neutrality, and corporate/government astro turfing on Reddit that seem like highly plausible, non-debunked conspiracies.</p>

<p>I guess I just don&#39;t understand why requiring users to be informed by credible evidence before posting counts as creating an echo chamber, and refrain from partisan political attacks/cheering counts as creating an echo chamber. To me it seems like the opposite, which was part of my goal.</p>

<p>But if you think that creating a subreddit devoted to conspiracies, where literally the only criteria is to not ignore highly credible evidence without addressing and rebutting it doesn&#39;t bode well for finding truth, we&#39;re going to have to agree to disagree.</p>

<p>Like I said, if evidence surfaced that aether was real, or 2+2=5 I&#39;d be happy to discuss it. But without any evidence to the contrary, I feel that providing a platform for people to argue that 2+2 !=4 is more likely to lead people away from truth than towards it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sometimes discussions verge on the metaphysical/preternatural. Often there is NO evidence to these things, and yet they are frequently discussed in the conspiracy community.

<p>Apart of discussing and researching conspiracies deals with eye witness accounts. Other times info comes from myths, legends, folk stories, and urban legends.

There should be places where conspiracies which are vetted and have serious evidence backing them are discussed.

    <div class="md"><p>Another issue. From my experience, this board has always run a bit to the right. I love the leftists that post here, and it is so vital, but what I am afraid of is that this is going to turn into another neoliberal/neoconservative echo chamber. Those on the far left, right, and far right will be stifled like everywhere else.  What the hell is happening? Not enough info from mods is coming out. I know you guys are volunteering your free time for this, but you guys chose this responsibility. I know there are plenty of Trump shills and other right wing shills, but anybody with any basic common sense knows that the most sophisticated and strongest shilling is from neoliberal sources and their allies. What is going to defend against the slide in that direction like every other damn sub on reddit?</p>

<p>And again I just have to say that every single serious conspiracy theory that has any legs is predominantly political! </p>

<p>I think there should be some sort of constitution or manifesto made to regulate and guide this sub, so that nobody, not even moderators can cross certain lines. I can see no other way. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Conspiracy culture has been driven by the right up until recently.  Conspiracy is explaining away  John Birch Society, American Security Council, Council for National Policy, all drove the New World Order craze of the late cold war and into the 1990&#39;s.  Just doing a precursory investigation of where those ideas originated right out of the general&#39;s left vs. right feuds of the late 40&#39;s to 50&#39;s. Several of their members were also responsible for varying degrees to the melding of occult methodology and the UFO phenomena into the talk radio spectrum and are now perpetuating it through the internet.</p>

<p>The left is seemingly catching up since the election last year as consensus reality is breaking and we are in something amounting to post-truth bubbles. Mensch is just the beginning for the left.  At worst at the moment you have Manafort not registering as a foreign agent as he has advised elections all over Europe for 40 years and has deep ties back to several Eastern Bloc arms dealers.  Flynn is up for tax evasion and not registering as a foreign agent but there has been some realization especially on MSNBC this is a way to motivate their base.</p>

<p>Even the the throwback topics at the top of this sub which is more in line with some of the original community here... Are coming right off of Joseph Farrell&#39;s personal promotion squad from one of the mods who is a member of his community.</p>

<p>Nevermind the more salacious of the hilarious topics that have become political hot potatoes recently...  You are never going to unwind politics from conspiracy, a conspiracy by definition are individuals colluding for an illegal goal.  Politics as a broad definition are people colluding together for a legal goal.</p>

<p>The static to signal ratio has been getting amazingly high recently.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can answer that, it happened a few months before the end of the election. </p>

<p>I used to post here a good bit and then the election ramped up, Trump was the winner of the Republicans National Convention and Hillary the winner of the DNC and things went to complete hell. </p>

<p>There was an inarguable shift in not only what was heavily pushed in this sub but also what political bias it took. This sub has always delved into politics but never before had it been so inarguably pushing one side over another. It was subtle at first and less noticed but as time went on it only got worse and worse. If you supported one side or another you were a shill (no matter of side) if you didn&#39;t believe either side you were a shill in disguise. There was no winning. No matter where you stood you were inevitably going to be accused of supporting one side or another. You couldn&#39;t say a single thing about either candidate without being accused of supporting whichever side you weren&#39;t referring to at the time. If you called out Hillary you supported Trump. Called out Trump you supported Hillary. Those in the middle we&#39;re not allowed to stay in such, at least according to people&#39;s perceptions. </p>

<p>This election split people so much that everyone felt on edge. Which led to finger pointing on all sides. Tie that in with the rise of bot accounts and clear agendas on display across all of Reddit and people were only split more. </p>

<p>It didn&#39;t help that Reddit as a whole has allowed covert advertisements. Which led to a group of people already keeping an eye on all things and taking a questionative stance towards things to be even more speculative of what they were seeing because what many considered relevant post were getting removed/brigaded/down voted etc. Because no matter the side if you saw a post they didn&#39;t support your side it was an attack.</p>

<p>This sub, simply put, splintered because people who all agreed they were for conspiracies started playing political games. Believing their side was right and the other wrong. Not everyone, but enough. And many saw this for what it was the clear cut establishment attempting to pit two sides against one another. Sadly those that have attempted to call this out were ignored. And now it may be to late. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Could this be because of my post trying to raise awareness for exposing the New World Order? </p>

<p>Pretty much nearly everyone agreed with that sentiment. It had 1.k upvotes and an immediate positive reaction from the community right upon posting. Was it aggressive? Potentially. But I felt I had to get a message across. I think what we&#39;re seeing is going to be a ban of all NWO or one world government related discussion, under the guise of it being &quot;political discussion&quot;.</p>

<p>I never called for anything or any topics to be banned in my OP. That would be unfair, I don&#39;t believe in banning any free discussion, however, I raised a good point that perhaps we should focus on the EVIDENCE BACKED conspiracies, and maybe stray away from the Pandora&#39;s box (Bigfoot, flat earth, conspiracies that have very little provable evidence to them).</p>

<p>Even if Bigfoot or flat earth were real, there&#39;s WAY more evidence pointing to the existence of a group of Ruling elite who dominate the social and political realm. Why not allocate our resources and focus to where we can wake people up?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree, it&#39;d be disappointing to see politics get banned because everything is, to some extent, linked to politics. Discussions of 911 = Bush administration and his staff orchestrating things. Discussion of JFK assassination = CIA and motives of then-VP LBJ. Fed reserve = appointments of reserve chairman. And on it goes.</p>

<p>I respect the right of all political views to coexist on here, even ones that I think are utter nonsense and narrative-driven. If the topic is getting banned because of shills, then shills are the problem. Not the topic itself. </p>
