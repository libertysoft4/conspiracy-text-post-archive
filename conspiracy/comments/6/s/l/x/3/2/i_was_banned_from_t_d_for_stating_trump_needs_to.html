    <div class="md"><p>Im surprised that you would fight Trump when all hes trying to do is get the federal government the fuck out of our business. how could anyone be opposed to this??  He cut 11k federal jobs on monday.  He has saved $150 billion dollars from the federal deficit so far.  If he gets dumb ass congress to follow his lead on tax reform, our economy could be the greatest its EVER been.  Follow him</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mcmaster is not the sole source of leaks, he is a piece of the puzzle.  Also, WTF are you talking about?  Leaking entire conversations with foreign leaders so they can criticize his temperment?  Give me a fucking break.  Why didnt someone leak why we shipped $400 million in un marked cash to the Iranian regime in the middle of the night??</p>
