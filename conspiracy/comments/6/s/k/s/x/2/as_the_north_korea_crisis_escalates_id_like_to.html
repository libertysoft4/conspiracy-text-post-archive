This is speculated to have happened on 9/11 too. As the Korea situation escalates, don&#39;t be surprised if America aids them in destruction, or out right does it to blame them like the bay of pigs. Be sceptical in these times.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dad always said the best way to take down a buy bigger than you was to start with a quick stomp of your foot on one of theirs- ideally stomping your heel on their toes. If you&#39;re lucky you start by breaking one of their toes, but either way he said it&#39;s almost a gaurantee they will instinctively bend over in reaction to the foot stomp. That bend over might be real quick so be ready to have a fist, or ideally a knee, coming up to meet their face. If that doesn&#39;t work, run like hell.</p>

<p>Never tried, but I had the feeling he had experience to back his words.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Unfortunately it&#39;s more complicated than that. If any nuclear strike happens then everyone will have to deal with the fallout. It makes it easier on us if NK strikes first and ideally we would remove their government sans nuclear weapons (as it would incurr damage on our relationships with SK, China and Japan). But NK has been rumored to have received help from Russia in their nuclear program and lord knows we&#39;re in a proxy war with them, so anything can happen I guess. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>After reading the 428 page Wohlstetter report, I honestly think there was too much data to soft through, and too few people cleared to do the sifting. Only a handful of people were authorized to  view intelligence from HYPO and CAST. Intelligence was sent from the Pacific, to DC, then back to the Pacific in the most convoluted of ways, so as to limit the number of eyes viewing the raw products. </p>

<p>While I don&#39;t discount the possibility the attack was allowed to happen, I would also chalk this up to an enormous procedural failure. There&#39;s no way 4 or 5 people could have possibly gone through the amount of incoming information. The warning was 100% there in DC, but whether they were able to get to it in time is another story. </p>

<p>All that being said, dozens of war warnings were issued to Hawaii, which fostered a &quot;cry wolf&quot; syndrome.  It&#39;s not like they weren&#39;t warned of imminent attack, but that they were warned too often to the point of growing to disregard warnings.</p>

<p>If you ever have the opportunity, I&#39;d highly recommend checking out Roberta Wohlstetter&#39;s Pearl Harbor: Warning and Decision. It&#39;s a comprehensive report of who knew what, and when, leading up to the attack. It doesn&#39;t have all the answers, but it did lead me to believe the attack wasn&#39;t completely allowed by Washington, and that Washington knew when and where the attack would occur, or was any way involved in the planning. </p>

<p>A good example of something like that would be the USE Maddox and USS Turner-Joy in Vietnam, known as the Gulf of Tonkin Incident. That was an utter fabrication of conflict that Washington perpetrated with malice and forethought. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know, in a way conspiracy theories are comforting. They say that somebody has control, and that the people in control are just controlling things in a bad way.</p>

<p>The scarier thought is that nobody is really in control, because the complexity of things is higher than the human brain was built to handle. This would mean that at the macro levels of government and economics, nobody is driving the train. The whole system just moves as it will, and occasionally individuals glimpse enough of the overall picture to observe that it isn&#39;t optimal, but nobody can do anything about it.</p>

<p>That&#39;s what the Pearl Harbor situation sounds like. The people in charge simply couldn&#39;t process the information because it was too complex. It may look like a conspiracy, but a conspiracy assumes a high level of competency. I think we see less and less competency as the overall complexity grows.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a fairly common rebuke to conspiracy theories; I feel like we all learn this one at school at some point so we have some comfortable generalization to disregard conspiracy theories and feel good about our governments. </p>

<p>But it&#39;s just that, a generalization.</p>

<p>Just because some people have accidents with pistols doesn&#39;t mean nobody was ever willfully shot with one, if you know what I mean.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You ask me, conspiracy theories being real is far scarier than them not being real. If they&#39;re real, and there is some kind of shadowy cabal controlling our destiny, there&#39;s no way we&#39;ll escape a dystopian future. If they&#39;re not real, perhaps science and technology have a chance of liberating us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s the opinion of someone who took the time and did actual research. Take it however you will but that&#39;s not my goal. I explained the circumstances as I understand them, then offered a true example of what the previous commenter was insinuating, perpetrated years later, and even involving some of the same characters such as Dulles. You don&#39;t have to believe me but no part of that was meant to be demoralizing, and the &quot;redirect&quot; was a direct parallel to another example of a White House perpetrated false flag attack. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not to mention it makes no goddamn sense.  Kim Jung Un knows what will happen if he even presses the &quot;fire nuke&quot; button, the United States will level his country, every square inch, into a sheet of glass.  He has NO reason to fire a nuke.</p>

<p>It&#39;s deterrence, extortion, and propaganda.  </p>

<p>Deterrence keeps foreign powers out of his country, it gives him a big scary gun to brandish to make sure everyone listens when he speaks and no one thinks about invading him.  You attack me, I attack you.  There becomes no way to <strong>cleanly</strong> remove KJU from power.  </p>

<p>Extortion.  This nuclear threat becomes a way to continue to convince the world to give in to humanitarian aid to NK.  It&#39;s free food and free water and free supplies for NK, which can be used to help people, or socked away for a rainy day (a war), or can be bought and sold on the black market for money.  It&#39;s basically free GDP for NK.  </p>

<p>Propaganda.  This is the one that really matters.  KJU has convinced, via his father and grandfather, the entire nation that he&#39;s the only thing protecting them from the horrible outside world.  If they don&#39;t have nukes, if he isn&#39;t seen as proudly standing up to a bully, then they won&#39;t blindly obey him.  He needs the threat, not the actual weapon.  </p>

<p>A used nuke is worthless to him.  He needs a bigger scarier weapon to wield his power.  The war in NK won&#39;t be won with nukes, it will be lost with nukes, regardless of who fires first.  The war in NK will be won with culture, convincing the NK people to defect and stop obeying.  One day, someone in his government will organize a coup based on better relations with the enemies of the Kim Dynasty.  We can&#39;t nuke our way to a safe Korean peninsula.  </p>

<p>IT would be the end of their country, to what? <em>Maybe</em> hit the west coast? That nuke, if mounted on a warhead, would have to make it through 5+ of the most advanced missile defense shields on the planet. Then we would stomp them into the stone age. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>Propaganda for their own people. This might look like chaos but its all very calculated on the NK side. </p>

<p>They know they will never be able to do any meaningful damage to another country they rant on about, they know exactly how outpaced they are by other western powers. The rhetoric does two things, gives them sound bites to feed to their people and to a lesser extent the military and leadership and secondly to purposely not be taken seriously. </p>

<p>Its like the bully on the playground being the weakest person in the group, he talks a lot of ridiculous shit but we all know he is harmless. As soon as the threats become legitimate they start being taken seriously. If you give a speech about laying waste to an entire continent and raining down hell fire every person in the know realizes exactly how ridiculous that sounds and they get a pass for being that weird kid. </p>

<p>I know this is an unpopular opinion but this is one of the reasons the Iran deal Obama started is a very good move to neutering that avenue for NK. </p>

<p>I dont think so, it would destabilize the region too much and piss off our allies in the area. We are talking China, SK and Japan at the very least taking pretty large hits to their economy as millions of refugees flood across the border. </p>

<p>Which in turn those allies will most likely try to reclaim those lost dollars by negatively affecting trade with America, jobs will be lost and economies will suffer. </p>

<p>Thats a real honest threat though. NK cant project enough force to be dangerous. If they threw everything they had at SK alone they would be fucked into the stone age within 24 hours. </p>

<p>It would be more like the bully saying he is bring in his dad huge 90 caliber minigun to school that he totally has and shows up with a nerf gun from 1973. </p>

<p>Took me 2 minutes to prove your smug ass wrong: <a href="http://www.strtrade.com/news-publications-100-percent-scanning-cargo-containers-waiver-request-053116.html">http://www.strtrade.com/news-publications-100-percent-scanning-cargo-containers-waiver-request-053116.html</a></p>

<p>All incoming containers were supposed to be scanned starting in 2012, but three successive waivers have been issued on that requirement, because it&#39;s a hard thing to do.</p>

<p>Also, I never said nobody has thought of this, so you&#39;re defending a strawman. All I said was that the shipping container delivery system seems more likely than the icbm, which you seem to agree with since you think it&#39;d be easier for NK to mail a nuke to the WH than use an icbm, so really not sure why you&#39;re even debating me.</p>

<p>Im of the mind that we would never retaliate to a NK nuke with a nuke. If NK needs to go China would be one of the first countries to step up to bat and most likely put in place a regime friendly to Chinese interests. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again - that&#39;s completely unproven and a subject of real debate between the people giving us the news and the people actually on the ground in Syria. There are sources that put the sarin attacks on Libyan gas that was brought into Syria by &quot;rebel&quot; forces after the overthrow of Qadafi. It&#39;s worth being very skeptical of reports  when - at the height of international awareness about the conflict - the seemingly sane Assad decided to gas his own people. Not a very strategic move and it only benefits the groups calling for regime change... Hmmmmm.</p>

<p>Most likely false flags committed by rebels to help justify the US entrance. There was no motive for Syria to use the chemical weapons.</p>

Then, in order to avoid being bombed or further sanctioned, we&#39;d have to make perfectly available all possible military sites for inspections any time China saw fit.

Ultimately, we&#39;d learn that it was all a ruse to generate sympathy for a war against us in order to obtain the rights to our natural resources.

    <div class="md"><p>NK hating us and wanted to nuke us is because Bush Jr. came in and shut all the previous negotiations down and tried to be tough with them. SK had what they called the Sunshine Policy to improve relations between North and South. Bush bashed the policy too. So NK said screw you too we&#39;ll show you. They were playing hard through the 90s by kicking out the atomic agency inspectors, but they were still following the nuclear agreements to reduce their supply for a long time. Wasn&#39;t until Bush screwed everything up.</p>

<p>Also, the Rumsfield/ABB thing people keep mentioning was for a company to come into NK and replace their nuclear power with material that couldn&#39;t be easily made into weapons, and in return NK would get better power equipment. Besides the US, a half dozen other countries were part of the deal to supply the material through ABB. Why Rumsfield suddenly went anti-NK when he became part of Bush admin, I don&#39;t know and he literally has never talked about it last I read.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I DO believe the US was weakened after Iraq, in the sense that our ME troops were stretched by what was going on in Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan, Libya, the refugee crisis, etc. etc. By the time the whole &quot;red line&quot; debacle in Syria happened, the US understood that we would LOSE if we engaged in a war with Syria/Iran/Russia/China. </p>

<p>I truly believe that China saw all of this (and the instability of the economy after the 2008 crisis) to ramp up their reach across the South China Sea, Africa, Latin America, etc. I believe the stage is set for the East (China/Iran/Russia mostly) to try to dethrone the hegemony of the US dollar. US dollar debt is one of the last bastions of power the West has over the developing world. The developing world already has set up their own IMF-type of institution behind China (the AIIB, good article <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/opinions/the-aiib-and-the-one-belt-one-road/">here</a>, in order to capitalize on the weakness of the US dollar as a reserve currency. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The McCollum memo contained an eight-part plan to counter rising Japanese power over East Asia:</p>

<p>A. Make an arrangement with Britain for the use of British bases in the Pacific, particularly Singapore</p>

<p>B. Make an arrangement with the Netherlands for the use of base facilities and acquisition of supplies in the Dutch East Indies</p>

<p>C. Give all possible aid to the Chinese government of Chiang-Kai-Shek</p>

<p>D. Send a division of long range heavy cruisers to the Orient, Philippines, or Singapore</p>

<p>E. Send two divisions of submarines to the Orient</p>

<p>F. Keep the main strength of the U.S. fleet now in the Pacific[,] in the vicinity of the Hawaiian Islands</p>

<p>G. Insist that the Dutch refuse to grant Japanese demands for undue economic concessions, particularly oil</p>

<p>H. Completely embargo all U.S. trade with Japan, in collaboration with a similar embargo imposed by the British Empire</p>

<p>In 2002, Gaddafi set an example by surrendering all of his weapons of mass destruction, becoming the hero for a day in America&#39;s eyes. </p>

<p>Didn&#39;t Ukraine also surrender their Nuclear weapons only to be invaded by Russia? I don&#39;t think Obama/Clinton are the only reason people don&#39;t want to give up their weapons.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>NK hating us and wanted to nuke us is because Bush Jr. came in and shut all the previous negotiations down and tried to be tough with them. SK had what they called the Sunshine Policy to improve relations between North and South. Bush bashed the policy too. So NK said screw you too we&#39;ll show you. They were playing hard through the 90s by kicking out the atomic agency inspectors, but they were still following the nuclear agreements to reduce their supply for a long time. Wasn&#39;t until Bush screwed everything up.</p>

<p>Also, the Rumsfield/ABB thing people keep mentioning was for a company to come into NK and replace their nuclear power with material that couldn&#39;t be easily made into weapons, and in return NK would get better power equipment. Besides the US, a half dozen other countries were part of the deal to supply the material through ABB. Why Rumsfield suddenly went anti-NK when he became part of Bush admin, I don&#39;t know and he literally has never talked about it last I read.</p>
