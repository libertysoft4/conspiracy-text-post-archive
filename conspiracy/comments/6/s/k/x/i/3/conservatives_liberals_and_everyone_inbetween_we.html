<p>Its hard to know what North Korea is actually like outside of the propaganda. Defectors stories from North Korea have again and again been proven to be falsified in many ways (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/13/why-do-north-korean-defector-testimonies-so-often-fall-apart">Why do North Korean defector testimonies so often fall apart?</a>), including details of the famed Camp 14:</p>

<p>When questioned, Shin confessed that parts of his account were also inaccurate, including sections on his time in Camp 14, the infamous labour camp for political prisoners, and the age at which he was tortured.</p>

<p>I&#39;d also like to come back to this quote of yours:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They are perhaps committing the worst human rights abuses of any country.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, lets look at some facts...</p>

<p>*<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_731">The Japanese scientists of Unit 731, who performed live vivisections on their populace, gassed and bombed them, amputated limbs and infected citizens to see how they died, and were pardoned by the US in exchange for the information they collected.</a></p>

<p>*<a href="http://www.salon.com/2015/11/18/this_is_why_they_hate_us_the_real_american_history_neither_ted_cruz_nor_the_new_york_times_will_tell_you/">The most powerful country in the world has committed more crimes against national sovereignty and intervened in more countries&#39; political processes than any other country in history. Dozens of nations have been utterly destroyed and tens of thousands killed by US military intervention throughout the world. This is one of many articles on the topic.</a></p>

<p>*<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iraq-deaths-survey-idUSL3048857920080130">The wars in Iraq and Syria have led to horrifying humanitarian catastrophes, including the estimated deaths of up to one million Iraqi civilians. &quot;More than one million Iraqis have died as a result of the conflict in their country since the U.S.-led invasion in 2003, according to research conducted by one of Britain&#39;s leading polling groups.&quot;</a></p>

<p>*<a href="https://news.vice.com/story/the-us-led-coalition-killed-a-staggering-number-of-civilians-in-march-monitor-reports">“Nothing had prepared us for that level of civilian casualties,” said Chris Woods, director of Airwars.</a></p>

<p>*<a href="http://www.alternet.org/world/35-countries-where-us-has-supported-fascists-druglords-and-terrorists">The US has supported more terrorist and extremist groups than any other country in the world. Here are thirty five examples.</a></p>

<p>*<a href="http://nypost.com/2014/01/05/us-is-the-greatest-threat-to-world-peace-poll/">And speaking on reputations, I have news for you, buddy: 25% of the world thinks the US is the biggest threat to peace of any country. Pakistan comes in second at a measly 8%.</a></p>

<p>North Korea is not a paradise and the Kim regime has committed flagrant abuses of human rights, but we have zero moral high ground to claim here, and invading the country or bombing them into submission would only cement the US as an evil imperialist power, as history seems to show as well. In demonizing North Korea while refusing to look at the abuses committed by your own country, you are proving yourself to be heavily indoctrinated by actual US propaganda, which hopes that you don&#39;t look any deeper than the latest CNN feed.</p>

<p>My point is just that even if those stories are true, NK has done less harm to the world than the US empire has over the past 50 years. The Korean problem shouldn&#39;t be solved with war or intimidation, which is what US politicians have been pushing for years.</p>

<p>I&#39;m pretty sure Russia and China would not appreciate the potential fallout from such an ordeal. And I would care. Diplomacy and sanctions have done a fine job for the last 30 years.

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re right. I thought it was. But then again that was two presidents ago. I&#39;m sure the program has been updated. In the past we have always treated nuclear nations with respect. But maybe not this time. I just looked it up. They&#39;ve been nuclear since 2006. And still no respect. They&#39;re just trying to get attention. But when we just keep ignoring them at some point they&#39;ll act. I just hope that they don&#39;t end up acting like Japan did. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We also must not forget that this North Korean crisis would not be what it is without Obama+Clinton&#39;s decision to remove Gaddafi in Libya.</p>

<p>In 2002, Gaddafi set an example by surrendering all his weapons of mass destruction, becoming the hero for a day in America&#39;s eyes.</p>

<p>By invading Libya in 2011 under &quot;humanitarian pretenses&quot; and then removing Gaddafi, America made a very symbolic statement that there is no protection nor inherent right to sovereignty to those who comply by giving up their WMD&#39;s. Instead, the countries that comply are now vulnerable to the full force of the Western military and they will be defeated.</p>

<p>Is there any surprise North Korea isn&#39;t going to give up their nuclear intentions? Is there any reason to believe that they will be left alone if they comply to the world&#39;s wishes?</p>

<p>Ukraine gave up their nuclear weapons in 1994. Russia was also promised that NATO would not expand eastwards around that same time. Over time, NATO broke that promise and converted all ex-Warsaw Pact countries to their Cold War-era military alliance, eventually knocking on Ukraine&#39;s door around 2012-2013. </p>

<p>Then came the Western-backed coup of 2014, which was clearly instigated by Western intelligence and friendly Ukrainian Neo-Nazi groups. </p>

<p>Russia is also dealing with being on the other side of the greatest military buildup since World War Two along Russia&#39;s western border. The West has also built an anti-missile shield in Romania AND installed missiles in all of these new Eastern European NATO countries. Why provoke Russia like this? What is to be gained?  </p>

<p>I&#39;m no cheerleader of Putin, but it is clear who the aggressors in Eastern Europe are right now. </p>

<p>Highly debatable, and NATO not expanding eastwards was never part of any official agreement. You are referring to remarks made by several politicians that expressed that NATO wouldn&#39;t expand eastward, but there was never any official document that stated those terms</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, there was no official document, but these were promises made by the US President at the time (George Bush Sr.) and his representative. Hardly just another politician. </p>

<p>The promise was that East Germany would be allowed to have special NATO privileges, and that would be it. Central and Eastern Europe would be demilitarized in order to provide a bridge from East to West. </p>

<p>I get it. America bested the Soviet Union. Nothing was on paper and the US took advantage of that. </p>

<p>My point remains that by starting the new chapter of Russo-American relations with this sort of deception, America ensured that the relationship would remain tense as all hell unless Russia bent the knee. Yeltsin did at the expense of the Russian people&#39;s livelihood. Putin didn&#39;t. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thus, during the press conference following the February 24–25 Camp David meetings, Bush declared in general terms that “the former territory of [East Germany] should have a special military status, that it would take into account the legitimate security interests of all interested countries, including those of the Soviet Union.” </p>

<p>Nor did a telephone conversation between Bush and Gorbachev on February 28 help clarify the issue. During the call, Bush told Gorbachev that “the united Germany should remain in NATO; that American troops will remain in Europe as long as the Europeans want them; and that there needs to be a special status for the former territory of the GDR.” Further, the president pledged that the United States would recognize the “legitimate security interests” of all parties. Notably, in highlighting limits to NATO’s future role in Germany and recognizing the need to acknowledge Soviet “security interests,” Bush was echoing comments by Baker and Gates during their February 9 talks with the Soviet leadership. Combined, the new terms could be interpreted as explaining how NATO would avoid expanding eastward if Germany reunited within <a href="http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/ISEC_a_00236">NATO.</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes I have read that, Bakers explanation for what he meant is unconvincing and I do think he meant that the US wouldn&#39;t expand eastward. However he didn&#39;t have anywhere near the authority to guarantee that, and I think it&#39;s clear that Bush never said it.</p>

<p>Overall I think it is pretty scummy by both Baker and Genscher, but I&#39;m not overly sympathetic towards the Russians in this situation since I don&#39;t think it comes close to meeting the requirements of an &quot;agreement&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s fair. </p>

<p>Yet, even if we remove American deception with regards to NATO expansion from the Russo-American discussion, we are still left with American provocation, manipulation of information and aggression. What is the purpose in encircling post-1991 Russia with NATO besides provocation and aggression? What is the purpose of placing missiles in all of these countries? The US are playing war games that can easily result in a nuclear standoff. </p>

<p>Robert Gates, CIA director in 1991, has written in his memoir Duty that with the collapse of the U.S.S.R., Cheney “wanted to see the dismantlement not only of the Soviet Union and the Russian Empire but of Russia itself.” I&#39;m afraid that most of Washington are Cheneyites now, and have been building up to this since it became clear that Putin wasn&#39;t going to be their puppet. </p>

<p>Little to none, especially those assets already in the region. </p>

<p>Anybody who thinks this will involve a single sortie one and done strike is fooling themselves. If this kicks off it&#39;s gonna be a big deal, and the loss of life of American servicemen will be massive. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you even have any understanding of military strategy? </p>

<p>You send in F22 and 35 to destroy SAM radar sites, after that the rest comes in. Then there are also the Bombers, B1, B2 etc. </p>

<p>It wont be a single sortie but it will be over in a week, with little to no loss of life to NATO and China. NK is just so extremely behind in every single aspect it&#39;s not even a challenge.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes I do. Im wondering if YOU realize the difference between expected Equipment capabilities and the realities of who has what equipment where, and how much of it. The overwhelming majority of the heavy lifting is going to be done by the f-18s on the carriers and f-15s and 16s in South Korea, and big conventional bombers from Guam not the 22s and 35s in the limited numbers there are on active duty at this time and in theatre. </p>

<p>Besides a lot of that equipment is camouflaged or in bunkers and caves, and won&#39;t be rolled out until after the first wave of strikes. That&#39;s something the military acknowledges.</p>

<p>I&#39;m also saying the second this kicks off there&#39;s gonna be a lot of damage done to military assets along the DMZ, and a lot of your air support will be devoted there initially to control the damage there. </p>

<p>Ill try to find the source but I think people are dramatically underestimating how well prepared SK is for this exact scenario. </p>

<p>Most of the NK artillery (Their main form of offense) is outside of range of Seoul, SK has extremely advanced anti missile systems, as does Japan. </p>

<p>NK would be able to sustain maybe a few hours of shelling before most of their offensive capabilities are wiped out. SK knows exactly where their invasion tunnels are and have them rigged to collapse if anyone tries to move equpiment or soldiers through them, SK has literal kill bots on their side of the border with millions of mines in between. SK keeps jets idling on the runway so they can neutralize any NK incursion immediately. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What you need to do is stop being a hysterical partisan, and stop pretending you&#39;re some kind of neutral figure in every post you make. You&#39;re transparent.</p>

<p>&quot;Trump&#39;s desire for war against Korea&quot;, you say, without mentioning North or South. But moving on... where are you getting this information from that he wants war? <strong>They threatened to nuke a US territory.</strong> What&#39;s he supposed to do? Have a beer summit with Kim Jong Toadboy?</p>

<p>Trump has always said negotiations come first, but he will not take any options off the table. This is the only logical position to take. You don&#39;t take any options off the table when someone is threatening to fucking nuke you. This anti-Trump insanity has gone so far that thousands of people on Twitter right now are basically taking North Korea&#39;s side just in an attempt to hurt Trump. It&#39;s madness.</p>

<p>Every source I&#39;ve read about this, NK says if the US strikes them first, they will retaliate with nuclear weapons. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you. It has been happening for years. But now Trump is president, so he&#39;s Hitler starting WW3 and global nuclear annihilation just for fun.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the difference in reaction from the extreme anti-Trumpers (or maybe not so extreme, considering how many people on Twitter are going nuts with this) that annoys me, as if Obama wouldn&#39;t have nuked the shit out of NK if they launched something his way during his term. We all know he would. Just trying to be realistic here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>dont bother being realistic.  i&#39;ve come to realize in the past couple months that trump derangement syndrome is definitely a real thing. first i thought it was a joke, but no, it&#39;s sadly not.  we have a pretty large, gullible and hyper misinformed population being fed massive amounts of clickbait and getting extremely out of touch from reality by it. the over reactions are unreal. trump had 2 scoops of ice cream! and just look at that guy that went on a public twitter meltdown claiming that trump jr meeting with that russian woman about dirt on hillary is the greatest political scandal in US history with nothing even coming close.  he was dead serious. unreal. apprantly he never opened a history book? and he&#39;s a college professor.  i can&#39;t even look at my facebook newsfeed anymore, it&#39;s beyond depressing such a large portion of our population is simply this easily enraged with no ability to handle their emotions and actually look at the big picture.   the networks are making a killing taking advantage of this. my entire iphone news app is trump articles. there is no other news. it&#39;s ridiculous. </p>

<p>The &quot;two scoops&quot; story was one I had forgotten. Pathetic stuff. But then CNN made a second-by-second analysis of Trump&#39;s handshake with Macron in France. I&#39;m not even slightly exaggerating. They did this.</p>

<p>Coincidentally, the same CNN guy (Chris Cillizza) who got called out for &quot;fake news&quot; by the Polish president over another handshake: <a href="http://people.com/politics/polish-president-fake-news-trump-wife-handshake-snub/">http://people.com/politics/polish-president-fake-news-trump-wife-handshake-snub/</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>thank you for your comment.  </p>

<p>it might be maybe i don&#39;t understand how reddit culture works but i was replying to the initial user&#39;s comment and agreeing with him/her that there is a general overreaction to everything trump. i wasn&#39;t actually in my head attempting to engage in a discussion with anyone but them. however, i welcome it and thank you again for your input as it&#39;s actually constructive. and you&#39;re right, that opening line is not inviting for conversation but in my action i was simply supporting that user&#39;s comment.  should i have direct messaged them? </p>

<p>for me at least, if i wanted a general discussion i would have posted top level and worded it differently.  again, maybe i don&#39;t understand reddit, i&#39;m fairly new to it and probably fairly older than the median. </p>

<p>as for &quot;you&#39;re just dismissing anyone&#39;s arguments by saying they&#39;re deranged for not liking Trump&quot;.  i have to politely strongly disagree.  i think there is an overall ridiculous overreaction to everything trump in the networks and social settings i navigate.  the news, if you can even call it that, is manipulating and capitalizing massively on this. i&#39;ve never seen more clickbait garbage in my life. it&#39;s more TMZ than journalism. it&#39;s cheap and more entertainment based.  and this is no way suggests that i even support trump, i lean left. i&#39;m just disgusted with the state of our media and more so our population that eats up this garbage. it&#39;s pathetic to be honest and depressing regarding our future. </p>

<p>Should the United States allow a country openly hostile to it and armed with nuclear weapons to perfect an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of delivering nuclear weapons to U.S. soil?

<p>Where was the panic and hyped up media when SK threatened to preemptively nuke NK last year after Obama&#39;s war games? Where was the talk of Obama provoking WW3? If you can&#39;t see the difference in reaction now... I don&#39;t know what to tell you. You keep saying I should stop being an apologist, but you don&#39;t seem to think that relates to you at all.

Again I will revert back to the fact there has never been anything more than allegations and every one of those allegations had nothiing of substance more than someone saying it happened like 20 years ago and nothing was reported then and it was never a big deal until all these women came out at one time and none of them had anything credible </p>

<p>LOL, except him admitting to it, what more do you want, a video of the actual assault, is that how things work?</p>

<p>Well now youre just moving goal posts lol. </p>

<p>First link is an appropriate response, not feeding into their rhetoric and imposing additional sanctions. </p>

<p>Ive already explained that while NK threatens to do this shit they never ever would. They arent suicidal. look at their track record, they routinely make these claims and nothing ever happens. You know why? Because they arent dumb and they want to remain in power. Launching an attack against any of their neighbors or America will result in the end of their country will little to nothing to show for it. </p>

<p>Feel free to actually address this point. </p>

<p>Second link is about a SK response, Im not sure why you would want to move from our geopolitical response compared to theirs. If you cant understand the difference there Im not sure I can help you. </p>

<p>Third link is an OP ed... Not exactly a great resource. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Korean crisis has now become a strategic threat to America’s core national interests. The best option is to destroy the North Korean missile on the ground before it is launched. The United States should use a precise airstrike to render the missile and its mobile launcher inoperable.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>SK is already all over this, we dont need to be policing a situation that is already well under control. Its not Americas problem because NK is no threat to us. Unilateral intervention would piss off every single country involved, a lot. China would be rip shit that America decided to occupy a country they share a border with, like more pissed than we have seen them in decades. It would hurt our economy and theirs, you do know China is a pretty big trade partner, right? How do you think they would recoup their losses? They would fuck our trade deals and we would have to eat it. Same with SK and Japan, the sheer influx of refugees will hurt their economies and again they would look to reclaim some of it by hurting the US. This is why I said you need to take your feelings out of it, geopolitics is about strategic superiority not responding to slights. </p>

<p>Your last link supports my point. </p>

<p>Its from 2006 and talking about imminent strikes against the US. That never happened. Carter is a big interventionist and supports America sticking its guns in places it shouldnt. I mean there is a new dictator in office, many of the same policies but not the same person. </p>

<p>Also read this paragraph</p>

But it is unlikely to act on that threat.</strong> Why attack South Korea, which has been working to improve North-South relations (sometimes at odds with the United States) and which was openly opposing the U.S. action? <strong>An invasion of South Korea would bring about the certain end of Kim Jong Il&#39;s regime within a few bloody weeks of war, as surely he knows.</strong> Though war is unlikely, it would be prudent for the United States to enhance deterrence by introducing U.S. air and naval forces into the region at the same time it made its threat to strike the Taepodong.** If North Korea opted for such a suicidal course,** these extra forces would make its defeat swifter and less costly in lives -- American, South Korean and North Korean.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Suicidal course... NK wouldnt commit suicide just to prove a point, they want to remain in power not be forcefully destroyed and killed. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Mattis told reporters that this week&#39;s missile launch didn&#39;t threaten the U.S. He said it doesn&#39;t change the administration&#39;s determination to pursue diplomacy to resolve the nuclear threat, but he suggested North Korea might eventually push too hard.</p>

<p>Mattis said the North&#39;s intercontinental missile capability doesn&#39;t &quot;in itself bring us closer to war.&quot;</p>

<p>Trump, he said, has been clear &quot;we are leading with diplomatic and economic efforts.&quot;</p>

<p>Bruce Bennett, a North Korea expert at the Rand Corp., a federally funded think tank, said a fully effective U.S.-led bombing campaign would require precise intelligence about the locations of the North&#39;s nuclear and missile storage and launch sites, a number of which are dug into mountainsides.</p>

<p>&quot;We don&#39;t know where they all are,&quot; he said. &quot;Even if you knew where they all are, you&#39;re going to take potentially weeks of bombing to take those things all down.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If this goes to a military solution, it&#39;s going to be tragic on an unbelievable scale. So our effort is to work with the U.N., work with China, work with Japan, work with South Korea to try to find a way out of this situation.&quot;</p>

<p>I have been saying that shit-talking is normal, and threats of preemptive strikes as far back as the technology existed basically, and I never pushed the idea that NK was going to do anything.</p>

<p>None of what you&#39;re saying justifies taking options away though. There could be a scenario. But I doubt the intelligence (data) that officials have anyway, since they&#39;re so often wrong, but again this isn&#39;t new with Trump.</p>

<p>Mostly because I never said that. Im just pointing out why some options are retarded. I mean one option is to launch our entire nuclear arsenal at NK and completely glass the country. </p>

<p>Is that a valid option? Sure by your definition. Will it ever be implemented? Never. </p>

<p>Reread your original post to the OP. You are the one accusing people of taking options off the table, you are the one buying into hysteria and rhetoric. Everyone else is just pointing out how ridiculous it is to buy into that rhetoric and tell NK that threats will be met with &quot;Fire and Fury&quot; when every single person who knows the least bit about this knows that NK will do nothing and telling them shit like that only stokes imaginary fires that will lead to real war. </p>

<p>You simply cannot afford to show emotion at this level of international relations. You cant feed that fire of rhetoric with your own. </p>

<p>Trump not understanding the situation and speaking out of line does no one any good and puts us closer to a confrontation while at the same time making appear weak to the top players in that part of the world. We have a powerful army and could fuck NK into the stone age, everyone knows this. </p>

<p>Talk softly and carry a big stick. We dont need to talk shit because we can actually back up our threats which is why we need to not threaten countries with fire and fury, America should never make a threat, it should act. </p>

<p>I dont remember Obama returning empty threats to NK... Thats my point. America is powerful enough to act if it needs to not sling mud at 3rd world dictatorships. </p>

<p>As we are well within our rights to do so. NK could have responded with an attack but yet once again everyone knows that as soon as they do they cease to be a country. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I just think that&#39;s a little more provocative than some harsh words.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The difference being what Obama did, and Bush before him, is a projection of force, a real projection of force. Not a tweet. </p>

<p>Its basically a game of who throws the first punch. The results will be the same but one of those first punches hurts America more than the other. </p>

<p>If NK responded to completely joint exercises with shelling Seoul, they cease to exist. This is best case scenario in a lot of ways, we immediately have the moral high ground and no country would dare stand in Americas way if we were intentionally attacked. </p>

<p>We would have the support of the entire western world. </p>

<p>We can project force without sinking to the level of discourse as a 3rd world dictatorship. It should be well below the president to every even respond to the rhetoric. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Either the left will destroy the West or the West will destroy the left.  This has been festering since at least the 60&#39;s.  Last year it was all brought to light as the left was finally in a situation where they would actually lose an election. Identity politics, open borders for all the brown and black people of the world, protecting black and brown criminals while demonizing working white men, socialist agenda, control and collusion with the MSM, this list gets long.</p>

<p>That&#39;s Obama&#39;s true legacy.  He woke the world up to the true nature of the left.  Now that it&#39;s been exposed the vast majority of Americans are vehemently against the left.  Mark my words, the Democrat Party will not exist after 2018 and liberal will be a dirtier word than communist by then.  You will pretend you were never a leftist, just like the rest of your ilk.    </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Man, so many people are sooo ignorant on what liberal VS conservative really is.
These people keep flooding from T_D, a zionist controlled hangout where anti-liberalism is encouraged.</p>

<p>Those outside the U.S. see the lib VS con thing even more retarded because they don&#39;t
use &quot;liberal and conservative&quot;, they tend to be more specific and say left, right, centrist, etc.</p>

<p>These kind of people who keep hating a group (hating liberals, conservatives, LGBT people, poor people flipping burgers, etc.) just keep pushing &quot;muh ideology&quot;
divide and conquer. It&#39;s just sad.
When has this partisan hate fueled sport ever accomplished shit except division?
I seriously hate conservativism (anti-worker ideology) but I hope to teach people the truth about pro-establishment conservativism and so called &quot;liberalism&quot;. (What the establishment calls liberal and conservative, is actually NEOliberalism and NEOconservativism, although normal
conservativism is still shit.)</p>

<p>The elites keep winning if we keep thinking this is a sports match between &quot;da liberalz and da conservativz&quot;.
While most of the so called lib/con players (politicians) laugh all the way to the bank.
Many people still confuse cultural shit with politics.</p>

<p>But I have faith in humanity, hence I&#39;m working on a visual project to show people the truth about politics,
the stereotypes, the B.S. talking points, corporate media lies, etc.
There is no dominant left wing in the U.S.
The word liberal is nonsense and doesn&#39;t explain where on the spectrum anyone is.
Left liberalism, NEOliberalism, classical liberalism....these ideologies take the liberal name
and yet they&#39;re all so different.</p>

<p>Political science is the way to see past the corporate media&#39;s
stereotypical identity politics agenda of divide and conquer.
I hope the person you responded to, wakes the hell up
and stops hating on people he [currently] doesn&#39;t agree with.</p>

<p>Even the alt right (alt establishment) supporters want what the real left want.....jobs, pro-worker policies,
etc.
It&#39;s the alt right leaders (Alex Jones, Trump, Breitbart, Fox News, T_D shill mods, etc.) that are zionist shills.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great post.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve tried to understand this &quot;new age&quot; as well. I&#39;m an Australian and US politics bewilders me; it&#39;s like TPTB have convinced the TRADITIONAL left (the workers and generally soaking, the masses) that progression is their enemy. Therefore the traditional left is now the right. At least that&#39;s what the US looks like from the outside.</p>

<p>The traditional right, is the powerbase of TPTB. They have the money, they are the actual &quot;globalists&quot; (they instituted the neoliberal economic movement - known in the U.S. as Reagonomics). They increase profits by moving operations to third world shitholes. Yet now, the conservatives think globaists are left...bizarre. </p>

<p>However TPTB architectured this deliberately, they created extreme left culture and extreme right culture, they lay both sides media. My theory is this is all down to dumb down general society and allow most people to simply get lost in white noise.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi, thanks for the reply.
You&#39;re right.
Corporate media stereotypes like implying &quot;left wingers are all feminists&quot;
which is nonsense. I&#39;m a center left humanist (although I don&#39;t care much for ideologies, if something sounds wrong, I reject it, whatever the ideology).</p>

<p>Some people unfortunately don&#39;t see their own cherry picking.
Some people BELIEVE the corporate media when they lie, calling
Bernie Sanders a &quot;dictator communist/dictator socialist/anti-business/state capitalist/lunatic/sexist bernie bro/unpopular with minorities/etc.&quot;
but then they DISbelieve the anti-Trump stuff. 
The partisan mentality is still there, in denial. (IMO, Trump/Clinton are both shills, I don&#39;t really care about the Russia distraction.)
Or maybe it&#39;s just the shills who deviate from common sense, I don&#39;t know.</p>

<p>Real progression is not the weird crap that the establishment push.
Progress is about making things more equal than the messed up
anti-worker history humanity has had.
TPP is the opposite of progress for example.
Just because it&#39;s new, doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s progressive.
I think some people INcorrectly assume new deranged ideas = progressive.
But the new kids on the block, NEOliberalism and NEOconservativism are definitely anti-progress for workers.</p>

<p>Conservativism = conserving a low waged population. (Other interpretations could be &quot;conserving the way it was before
the unions gave us workers&#39; rights) Without the unions, we&#39;d all be working ALL WEEK, NO WEEKENDS.
Unions are US, the PEOPLE/workers (there is always a possibility of groups getting compromized but unions are usually good protectors of workers).
Corporations are THEM, the parasite elite beurocrats/elite bankers controlling the financial system and politicians.</p>

<p>Liberal is a pointless adjective.
It&#39;s about liberty, but liberty for who?
Many ideologies claim the name.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Classical liberalism (that&#39;s the free market Laissez-faire crap right?)
would be liberty for the corporations to screw us ALL (workers, consumers, etc.)
by removing all regulations (safety, ethics, worker conditions and pay, etc.)
Corporate dictatorship. Sort of like now, but with the INSANE TPP shit.</p></li>
<li><p>Left liberalism (a very general region of the spectrum, includes democratic socialism, social democracy and to an extent centrism among a few others)
is liberty for the workers/people, by protecting workers and awarding them what they are owed for their labor
(not necessarily ALL fruits of their labor, but at least a more reasonable amount).
Socialism/capitalism CAN co-exist in a better ratio.
But elites push &quot;capitalism baby!&quot; and &quot;eew socialism&quot;.</p></li>
<li><p>NEOliberalism, is one of those ideologies (like conservativism, and NEOconservativism) that champion crony capitalism.
Favoritist to corporations. Free tax money to Google, Apple, etc. etc. etc.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Lol, they havent been working tirelessly, they are barely a functioning state. Even if they develop a nuke capable of fitting on the head of a missile they will never be able to hit N America, they have to go through 5+ of the worlds most advanced missile defense systems from multiple countries. </p>

<p>NK knows that as soon as they attack their country will be wiped off the map. No one can defend them if the lash out at America and they know it. </p>

<p>Its 100% posturing and Trump playing into the &quot;raining fire&quot; fire rhetoric does nothing but validate the NK position (At least to its citizens and military). </p>

<p>Just to reiterate it will never ever happen... Unless we hit first. If we preemptively strike NK they will have no options left but to use any means to hit us back. If we hit first we lose the moral high ground and we will force them into a corner where they will use any nukes they have. Then Asia will be pissed because we just destabalized the entire eastern part of that continent, damaged SK, China and Japans economies which they will not be cool with. </p>

<p>Best way to handle NK is with counter propaganda. Show the people that the west is prospering and not the villains. </p>

<p>No they arent. Nuclear power? Yes, kind of. Unhinged? Yeah, kind of. They know exactly what game theyre playing and its all very intentional. They arent acting crazy because they are crazy, they are acting crazy because its been working. They have been autonomous for 50+ years playing the crazy card, thats a track record better than most dictatorships. </p>

<p>The fire and brimestone rhetoric isnt for the West, per se its for their own population. When they make bat shit insane claims as to their capabilities and threaten us with those (We will nuke your continent into the sea for example) we know thats bullshit and they know they arent able to. What it does do is give them propaganda material to use, now they can turn to their civilians and say &quot;Look at how powerful we are! I told them we would rain hellfire down on them and they did nothing!&quot;</p>

<p>The last thing they want is to be taken 100% seriously. If we took them seriously they lose their crazy card. </p>

<p>Lets revisit this statement. NK <em>might</em> and this is the smallest of mights, be able to shell parts of SK for an hour or two before their ability to attack is neutralized. Seoul is outside of most NK artillery and Seoul citizens train for this exact scenario. Some infrastructure damage is about the best outcome for engaging SK. </p>

<p>They know this, SK knows this, we know this. </p>

<p>So why would they sacrifice their entire country to <em>maybe</em> bruise SK? As soon as they attacked their country ceases to exist. </p>

<p>Do you honestly believe the rhetoric Kim says? Youre an idiot. </p>

<p>Do you really think NK is suicidal and is willing to destroy a decades old dictatorship to annoy the western world? It would be like having a neighbor that you hate and you throw a rock through his window knowing full well he will come over, shoot you in the face and burn your house down if you do. So is it worth throwing that stone?</p>

<p>They are zero threat to anyone and dumbasses who are ignorant to very basic facts about the situation say shit like you did. </p>

<p>Well 230 miles, but whos counting... Once more I dont think you realize how advanced our systems are vs theirs. Seconds after that launch it was most likely tracked by multiple countries who all had the ability to shoot it down if it were going to hit anywhere sensitive. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>Yeah, they didnt have to. </p>

<p>Multiple countries and multiple missile defense systems were tracking it but no one wants to reveal how capable they are at shooting down missiles unless they absolutely have to. </p>

<p>Japan doesnt want Russia and China to know how quickly they can react, the type of system they have and how capable those systems actually are. They also dont want NK to get any kind of idea about how these systems work or what they are capable of. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>unexpected ICBM just flew through their airspace with no resistance.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because there was no threat, if that missile was going to hit mainland Japan it would be dropped by any number of the missile defense systems it had to travel through. </p>

<p>Modern missile defense systems are pretty good. The only way to get through is to either spam so many rockets it overwhelms the defense system (Which NK will never be able to do) or to use those extremely advanced mach 30 ICBMs of which only a handful of countries have and is well outside of NK tech. Those puppies travel so fast they turn the atmosphere in front of them into plasma and most modern missile defense systems dont have the ability to intercept something moving that fast. I actually wouldnt be surprised if there were defense systems for those but again no one wants to show their hand in terms of how capable they actually are. </p>

<p>So essentially NK is neutered and every country doesnt want to share just how capable they are at defending themselves. </p>

<p>This isn&#39;t to say that Trump isn&#39;t an accomplice and isn&#39;t also liable.  He is.  However, the focus should never necessarily be on <a href="http://i.imgur.com/T1CKwfa.png">the emblem.</a>  It should be on <a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-2hTKPGxQ7ck/UIQr3Sfg2iI/AAAAAAAAE90/SxrQ4SMT6q8/s1600/Jaguar+XF+AJ+21.jpg">the vehicle behind the emblem.</a></p>

<p>If you really want to stop these kinds of unnecessary wars from happening, then you have to look <em>much</em> deeper than the figurehead.</p>

That&#39;s not going to change anything.

<p>You&#39;re telling me to stop thinking left and right, but the only person you can think of pinning war crimes on is the one person investigating Trump?</p>

<p>Why did you even bring up Mueller? Why not any of the hundreds of Republican Congressmen that for the PATRIOT Act or for endless war? Why did you mention this guy if you&#39;re not &#39;thinking left vs right&#39;?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think that you can say the same about Russia&#39;s involvement to Ukraine. </p>

<p>Ukraine gave up their nuclear weapons in 1994. Russia was also promised that NATO would not expand eastwards around that same time. Over time, NATO broke that promise and converted all ex-Warsaw Pact countries to their Cold War-era military alliance, eventually knocking on Ukraine&#39;s door around 2012-2013. </p>

<p>Then came the Western-backed coup of 2014, which was clearly instigated by Western intelligence and friendly Ukrainian Neo-Nazi groups. </p>

<p>Russia is also dealing with being on the other side of the greatest military buildup since World War Two along Russia&#39;s western border. The West has also built an anti-missile shield in Romania AND installed missiles in all of these new Eastern European NATO countries. Why provoke Russia like this? What is to be gained?  </p>

<p>I&#39;m no cheerleader of Putin, but it is clear who the aggressors in Eastern Europe are right now. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes that is a valid point and will not contest it, my argument lies more in the fact that there are decades of human rights abuses in North Korea in conjunction with a leader which is disregarding agreements made and is attempting to create weapons (is also likely using nuclear materials previous US administrations gave) which could harm the US and it&#39;s allies, to make matters worse they have made repeated, direct threats. </p>
