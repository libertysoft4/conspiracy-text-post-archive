    <div class="md"><p>I kinda wonder if the right and left shills are the same people sometimes, and they just put on different hats depending on the goals of the project. There was a comment from a self-proclaimed shill awhile back where he called us retarded, and said something like brb gotta go to a different sub and pretend like I am a liberal in another sub. It is just an anecdote, and hardly conclusive, but it makes a certain sense. The goal isn&#39;t to make trump or clinton look good or bad, just make sure that our entire conversation is focused on those things.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That instance was most likely a troll but there is definitely bots on both sides of the autistic screeching... That being said, they probably don&#39;t use the same sets of accounts for the same stuff.</p>

<p>What&#39;s telling to me is some users stand out in their way of talking and debating in political subjects, you know the usual methods used that give us an hint into what they are and those same patterns are used on various other subjects, notably in vaccine threads for some reason and UFO threads too, anything that is credible that goes outside the <em>official</em> &quot;reality&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I am sure we have different groups too. The one I am talking about had a certain authenticity though imho. It wasn&#39;t very dramatic, he didn&#39;t make any outrageous claims. </p>

<p>And the language patterns are why I keep saying we probably only have like 10 actual different political shills. Their voice and approach start sticking out after awhile. I think most of the people around here instinctively pick up on it. There are some NLP applications that could determine this more conclusively, but that would be a pretty time consuming project.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I really don&#39;t think so. But each one of the 10 run several accounts. And then use tools to scrape comments and posts for keywords of interest. Kind of a real time hit list. Then just use a prepared list of talking points that they just reword. I am not the smartest guy, but I am pretty sure I could do something like this easily based on what I know how to do. It would just be slower because I don&#39;t have something that lets me interact with several accounts at the same time. I had tools that allowed me to play several characters in everquest at the same from a single PC some time long ago. I could easily manage 6 characters. I knew other people that could manage more than that. I don&#39;t think this would be that much different. I even imagine it is kind of fun. </p>

<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Moscow’s use of disclosures during the US election
was unprecedented, but its influence campaign
otherwise followed a longstanding Russian
messaging strategy that blends covert intelligence
operations—such as cyber activity—with overt
efforts by Russian Government agencies, statefunded
media, third-party intermediaries, and paid
social media users or “trolls.”</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Russian Propaganda Efforts. Russia’s state-run
propaganda machine—comprised of its domestic
media apparatus, outlets targeting global
audiences such as RT and Sputnik, and a network
of quasi-government trolls—contributed to the
influence campaign by serving as a platform for
Kremlin messaging to Russian and international
audiences. </p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2017/05/11/full-transcript-acting-fbi-director-mccabe-and-others-testify-before-the-senate-intelligence-committee/?utm_term=.7982e1d9afbd">May 11 - Intelligence Hearing</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>COATS: Well, we are -- we will continue to use all the assets that we have in terms of collection and analysis relative to what the influence has been and potentially could be in future. Russians have spread this across the globe -- interestingly enough I met with the Prime Minister of Montenegro the latest nation to join NATO, the number 29 nation, what was the main topic?</p>

<p>Coats: Russian interference in their political system. And so it does -- it sweeps across Europe and other places. *<em>It&#39;s clear though, the Russians have upped their game using social media and other opportunities that we -- in ways that we haven&#39;t seen before. *</em>So it&#39;s a great threat to our -- our democratic process and our job here is to provide the best intelligence we can to the policy makers to -- as they develop a strategy in terms of how to best reflect a response to this.</p>

<p>COATS: I -- I would just add that the use of cyber and social media has significantly increased the impact and the capabilities that -- obviously this has been done for years and years. Even decades. But the ability they have to -- to use the interconnectedness and -- and all the -- all that that provides, that didn&#39;t provide before I -- they literally upped their game to the point where it&#39;s having a significant impact.</p>

<p>ROGERS: From my perspective I would just highlight cyber is enabling them to access information in massive quantities that weren&#39;t quite obtainable to the same level previously and that&#39;s just another tool in their attempt to acquire information, misuse of that information, manipulation, outright lies, inaccuracies at time.</p>

<p>But other times, actually dumping raw data which is -- as we also saw during this last presidential election cycle for us.</p>
