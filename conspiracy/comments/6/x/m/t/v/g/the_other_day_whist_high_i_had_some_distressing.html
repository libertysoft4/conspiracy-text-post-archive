        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">27</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2017-09-02 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/Fuygf575.html">Fuygf575</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So it started when I watched this YouTube video:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBl0cwyn5GY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBl0cwyn5GY</a></p>

<p>From watching this it became quite clear logically that this proved that psychic abilities are real. It&#39;s a concept I was realising whilst sober simply by the fact that &#39;empty space&#39; is a contradictory term as empty space literally means &#39;no&#39; space. So being connected to everything is a logical certainty. This is backed up by Ancient sciences and spiritual practices such as Buddhism and Hinduism, from which we&#39;re slowly starting to realise that such teachings were right all along - such as with the benefits of meditation and yoga. </p>

<p>I then watched this video:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehlw-9PJkIE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehlw-9PJkIE</a></p>

<p>And I found many videos on Youtube from people who repeated the experiment successfully. This concept is something spiritual masters also say is real and have realised for thousands of years. </p>

<p>So this got me thinking about why nobody in the science community is talking about this, and it made me wonder whether the answer was because most people simply don&#39;t have the awareness to see it. They can&#39;t see it because their discriminatory mind is too active, so they become illogical, irrational and overly sceptical. </p>

<p>This idea is supported by videos I have watched of Sadhguru (I would strongly recommend watching his videos as he&#39;s likely the wisest living person on the planet right now), a living awakened human being, who says today in our society we are being too intellectual, dissecting the world and it&#39;s driving us insane, explaining the epidemic of mental health problems today such as depression, anxiety as well as Autism- all stem from the intellect being too active, causing too much brain chatter that destabilises that persons ability to stay present and in reality and out of their head. </p>

<p>So that made me realise the issue underpinning these things is simply a lack of awareness. So then I started researching about why our intellect and discriminatory mind is increasing and thus causing us to have a lack of awareness- e.g. Autistic children have much higher levels of glutamate (brain activity) in areas of the brain associated with the intellect. It&#39;s why some famously have &#39;abilities&#39; like being able to be genius mathematicians or have extremely good memory. The extreme autistic however has so much glutamate in these regions that they have regular seizures, and almost no awareness of reality, something many don&#39;t realise about Autism.  </p>

<p>So then I had the &#39;realisation&#39; that factors are causing the intellect and brain activity in these regions to increase. As someone who has studied biochemistry for many years, I already knew pesticides are a ridiculous idea, and have read all the studies linking them to lower intelligence, and rates of Autism. I&#39;m sure many of you hear already know of this. I&#39;ve been eating organic pesticide free food for many years. </p>

<p>But I also then did further research into fluoride, and read these two articles:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/kwz5m3/why-are-governments-putting-fluoride-in-our-water-sheeple">https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/kwz5m3/why-are-governments-putting-fluoride-in-our-water-sheeple</a>
<a href="http://www.wakingtimes.com/2014/08/22/fluoride-affects-consciousness-will-act/">http://www.wakingtimes.com/2014/08/22/fluoride-affects-consciousness-will-act/</a></p>

<p>Not the most &#39;respected&#39; news outlets, but information is information, and the claims mentioned on that article are baked up by studies. Fluoride really does calcify the pineal gland and lower IQ, and the logic behind using it in water is, to any reasonable person, a stupid idea. The pineal gland has also be known since ancient times to be the &#39;third eye&#39;, essentially meaning human awareness. To for this to calcify, is essentially human awareness becoming blind. So awareness is lost and all that is left is the discriminatory intellectual mind, which has its uses in mathematics, but is also making us less happy and mentally stable. People are stuck in their heads, dissecting the world instead of being aware of it. Again, these ideas are repeated by enlightened gurus- people who have transcended the attachment to the discriminatory mind, or &#39;ego&#39;. </p>

<p>So this naturally then made me ponder the intent behind why governments would make such reckless decisions, which made me then enter into this &#39;paranoid&#39; state of mind, in which these realisations produced a little anxiety and as such I no longer trusted these ideas, as I have know from past experience that emotions can distort logic. It also concerns me that studies how shown that black tea naturally absorbs fluoride, and as someone from the UK who used to drink black tea daily makes me wonder what damage this has done. Everyone I know drinks this tea daily. </p>

<p>Despite my concerns of these realisations possibly being irrational paranoia, days later from smoking cannabis I still feel strongly that these thoughts were genuine realisations and not paranoia. It seems very reasonable that certain individuals who may be at the top of our social hierarchy do have the desire to make the majority of the population less aware than themselves, and despite clear science showing certain practices such as using pesticides, and fluoride in our food and water supply definitely causes brain damage, those in control still approve them. </p>

<p>This is either blissful ignorance on their part, or logical proof that their intent is to make us &#39;stupid&#39; and less likely to submit to our preconceived notions of how to live and essentially be a mindless cog in a wheel. And to repeat from a previous point, this &#39;brain damage&#39; is simply the intellect becoming too active. Now as I said, the intellect has its use - it helps us to create new technologies and ultimately makes our world more convenient - something those at the top of the social hierarchy would want to occur, as it benefits directly our level of comfort. and convenience. So in essence, it could be said that this tactic and increasing societies intellect is like &#39;robotising&#39; society to product more convenience, using society as a sort of mindless collective of workers to benefit those at the top. </p>

<p>I&#39;d appreciate feedback from this assessment. I&#39;m aware that posting in a conspiracy theory community may actually have a larger proportion of genuinely paranoid people compared to other communities, and so posting hear may cause me to receive responses to these ideas from paranoid people, and may in turn cause false feedback that just feeds possible delusions in a perpetually negative feedback loop. However at the same time if these ideas are from a place of reason, then this community may have more like minded people compared to other communities. </p>

<p>However I like to think I can remain very impartial so will take any feedback and unbiased as possible. A different viewpoint is very helpful and would be really appreciated. if I could just request one thing, please could you read the articles and watch the video before replying, just so you have the information that I had the formed the foundations of my &#39;realisations&#39; or potential paranoia or even slight psychosis. Thanks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s many ways the brain can b damaged, but one of the most common ways is when the intellect (the discriminatory mind) becomes too dominant compared to other forms of intelligence. This creates vast emotional instability, which could be classed as brain damage, as it&#39;s certainly not ideal health.</p>

<p>The intellect is just a survival mechanism that creates binary outcomes. On YouTube type &quot;Sadhguru intellect&quot; and he should have a video explaining it. It&#39;s a really useful thing to know.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Pineal Gland regulates sleep cycles.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The primary function of the pineal gland is to produce melatonin. Melatonin has various functions in the central nervous system, the most important of which is to help modulate sleep patterns. Melatonin production is stimulated by darkness and inhibited by light.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><sup><sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pineal_gland#Function">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pineal_gland#Function</a></sup></sup></p>

<p>It&#39;s distantly evolved from a light-sensitive organ on the heads of our ancient tetrapod ancestors. Pineal Glands are generally larger in animals that evolved further from the equator, suggesting that it plays a role in adapting sleep patterns to seasonal changes (ie. when to hibernate, etc.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d be sceptical of what modern science views the pineal gland to be. Neuroscience has yet to understand human consciousness whilst it would seem ancient sciences such as Ayurveda fully understood the human body thousands of years ago, as they just paid sufficient attention to the body rather than dissecting it with the intellect. </p>

<p>How can you see how the body works by just &#39;paying attention&#39;? </p>

<p>Because the human body has nerve endings throughout our entire body. If a pin pricks any part of internal organs we feel pain. It&#39;s just we only pay sufficient attention to things once sensation reaches a certain intensity (pain). If we enhance awareness (which is what meditation does) to such a degree we can simply be aware of exactly what is going on inside our body simply because we have nerve endings everywhere .</p>

<p>People who have taken LSD or cannabis have experienced this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for sharing your thoughts with us. Reading this, I personally feel like you sound less paranoid, and more skeptical. Which is good! A healthy person should be skeptical, but with balance, by being skeptical of even the ego traps we find ourselves stumbling through. From your post, it sounds like your questioning is genuine and in a healthy way. Also, marijuana can definitely boost the questioning/paranoia/skepticism in any individual, so perhaps that could be useful to keep in mind when having these sorts of train of thoughts, and resulting realizations.</p>

<p>Now to the actual content, I kind of agree with you. I think Brave New World and Orwell&#39;s dystopic visions of controlling state are not pure fantasy. Humans are constantly struggling for power, and therefore control of others, so it is completely understandable and RATIONAL that those at the top of the pecking order would attempt to control the lower populations, in any ways they can. Most effectively being in sneaky, subtle, surprising (re: psychologically manipulative) ways. Realizing this can lead one to an extreme state of distrust and paranoia. Which is understandable. But like anything, to remain healthy and within our best functioning state, we have to weigh the reactions to our actions, and not succumb to the naturally anxiety inducing things that are out of our control.</p>

<p>You have to find this mental (and physical, potentially spiritual) balance in your life, as an individual. Everyone is going to be different in terms of what they want, how they would like to achieve what they want, and how they will treat others throughout seeking their desires. If fluoride in your water causes you much mental distress, consider water purification techniques, or opting for fluoride-free toothpaste. I tried the latter, but I found it to be really not my thing, and ultimately I decided I could accept fluoride in my toothpaste. That may seems silly, but I felt like my paranoia was shaping my life and behavior, not necessarily for good purpose, or good cause. It might be amazing for someone else, and I think that is perfectly okay. The key is finding the balance that comforts you without hindering your growth as an aware, intelligent being.</p>

<p>To take it up a level, I also completely agree with you on the psychic abilities, and I think its probably a largely unspoken topic (on purpose) in Western society. I can&#39;t even pretend to understand, though I&#39;ve tried, how to effectively use these potential powers or even &quot;awaken&quot; them. I&#39;ve dabbled with quite a few mystical tools, and I would say they might be useful outlets for exercising these abilities. Like you said, it connects strongly with awareness (I usually say consciousness, but it&#39;s kind of a loaded word at this point). Expanding your mind&#39;s eye to broad, global, and even astronomical levels might be great, but always keep in mind balance.</p>

<p>Apologies if none of this makes sense or is scatter brained and not useful. As you understand, I (and many others here) are also skeptical, paranoid, and potentially bonkers people who are filled with distrust. I try to keep that balanced and checked, by being self-aware and keeping honest dialogue with myself and the world around me. I do hope this helps, and that it may resonate with you somehow. Peace!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The elites attack our awareness because it serves them and their overlords, which are negative ETs we would think are demonic. They just serve themselves even at the expense of others. They&#39;ve done it so long that they&#39;ve condensed it down. They steal the joy of mind by causing negative emotions, like bullies, sadists and trolls do. It transfers the joy of life energy to themselves. It also increases their mind over matter abilities.</p>

<p>To this end they enslave races. They are the origin of the myth of the devil and demons. They get their reputation, because to extract the energy they want they cause fear and suffering. Sacrifice rituals exist for that purpose. War, poverty, disease, famine, etc. are like harvests for them. They are consciousness parasites. They look scary, because it helps them feed.</p>

<p>Ultimately, our elites work for them. Like minds find utility in working for their common goals. Our elites made deals with them. The elites get access to knowledge, technology and assistance for enslaving humanity, the negative ETs get the humans to do the work of enslaving humanity for them. They get the energy of mind for a low cost to themselves that way.</p>

<p>If we were not so inhibited by these outside forces, and their <em>ahem</em>, willing servants, we would have ended a lot of suffering and fear, as well as have made better government for ourselves that reflects our collective will. These outsiders and their willing servants corrupt our actions to manifest our will in our world. They are hacking us to serve them, basically. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The human brain is a pattern detection machine, unfortunately this leads to false positives or false conclusions. </p>

<p>Occam&#39;s razor suggests that the profit motive is a more likely explanation for much of the behaviour you observe.</p>

<p>For example, it may be that some manufacturing process results in flouride production. Somebody discovered that flouride reduces cavities and felt they could profit by selling it to put in the water supply.</p>

<p>Pesticides reduce insects, increasing crop yields. Profit motive.</p>

<p>The negative impacts of various &quot;solutions&quot; are glossed over. Scientists know they are unlikely to get further funding unless they reach certain &quot;conclusions&quot;. Politicians and lobbyists.... it all comes down to money. Yes people conspire to get rich. If the side effects make people stupider or less healthy, they are minimized. Business as usual. </p>

<p>I do not think these sorts of thoughts are psychotic in nature but they may lean towards paranoid. The internet is an echo chamber: if you lean slightly towards paranoia, you may magnify that tendency by both your search patterns and what you tend to focus on. It is extremely easy to find &quot;facts&quot; to back up almost any conspiracy theory. Question everything; believe nothing. </p>

<p>There&#39;s nothing wrong with asking questions, or being skeptical, in fact I think these things are very important and not enough people are skeptical. That being said, truthfully you may want to step away from the weed, and the internet for a few weeks.  </p>

<p>Onwards,</p>
