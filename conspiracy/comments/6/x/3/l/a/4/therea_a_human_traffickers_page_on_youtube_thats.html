<p>The man who runs it is named Mark Catley. The Youtube page is named &quot;BebotsOnly Unforgiven&quot; Mark runs a child sex trafficking ring in the Philippines. He&#39;s a sick man and is a duel citizen of the U.S. and the Philippines. He has a wife and a kid he leaves in the United States when he goes there to do &quot;business&quot; in the Philippines. Achieved picture of him: <a href="http://archive.is/kzUiY/image">http://archive.is/kzUiY/image</a></p>

<p>His name and Facebook profile was scrubbed when we on Voat began to call him out.  His page is full of children being groomed like this one with pedophiles commenting stuff like &quot;tasty tasty tasty.......me redy 2 shoot......2 thumb up﻿ or this. </p>

<p>4,159 people are subscribed to the channel. </p>

<p>There are multiple &quot;Bebots&quot; accounts on Youtube.

<p>These are some of the videos (there are dozens with little girls and young teenagers being groomed by men) along with some of the sick comments on them.</p>

<p>&quot;Easy to judge fellas. Did u watch many of his videos about young girls posing like models intended for foreign clients? Yes it was but not to sell them for sex like a piece of meat. I know some girls on his other videos like Hazel, Czarina &amp; Bianca all of them are from Pampanga. They met their foreign sponsors old enough to be their father but nothing illegal happened. Actually the foreign guys ended up as the loser because they spent insane amount of money for the girls without something in return.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I think some of you don&#39;t quite get it.  Most of these girls come from poor families.  Their best chance at a decent life is to marry a western man.  White men are Rock Stars in the Philippines.  It&#39;s because all of their TV actors and actresses are light skinned.  These girls don&#39;t worry so much about the age of a man.  They are more concerned that he be faithful to her, and provide for her and her children.  It is absolutely normal for an 18 yr old girl to marry a 50 yr old man from the states or other western countries,....or even a wealthy pinoy.<br/>
   Stop judging.  This is the culture they live in.  I&#39;m 49 yrs old, in great shape, financially secure, etc; and married to a beautiful 30 yr old Pinay.  She had an 8 yr old daughter when we met, which made it virtually impossible to find a husband in her country.  She loves me, her family loves me, and most importantly, I love them.  My family has welcomed her with open arms also.  Please stop judging these people, based on our customs and beliefs.  Who&#39;s to say we&#39;re correct.  Hell, my grandmother was 14 when she married.  That was normal back then.﻿&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I bet a bunch of old pedophiles will go crazy about her. She is so young and innocent.﻿&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Your giving the young ladies opportunities for a better life, keep up the good work... ps i hope the young ladies find themselves good men...﻿&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UPj8KfvqxU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UPj8KfvqxU</a></p>

<p>&quot;mmmmm.....yes plz.....wunder if dey cun take a likkin n keep on likkin......oh yeah﻿&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZtafxfNcok">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZtafxfNcok</a></p>

<p>&quot;To all those who wants to report and claim this is a scam or a phedophile issue, I see this whole thing as - If there is a demand - There is a supply. SIMPLE AS THAT. To the foreign eyes the girls may look like under age, but do not forget the Filipina girls tend to look much younger than their age. A 26 year old can easily look 18. A 23 year old can easily look 16.
As long as the girls are of legal age  and as you lets face it - men loves it younger.
NOT A DAMM THING ANYBODY CAN DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT.﻿&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC6DNKRUv-A">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC6DNKRUv-A</a></p>

<p>&quot;These girls will remember this all their lives. A fun and nice time.﻿&quot;</p>

<p>We have reported him many times many of us on Voat to Youtube. This is a human traffickers page selling children. Youtube has done jack shit about it. Since we found him people have begun to realize and comment on his page and the pedophiles are deleting their content and Youtube pages. Some haven&#39;t though. The leader, Mark Catley, his Facebook is completely scrubbed from the net after we found it.</p>

<p>The worst part to? Not only does Youtube know about it all his videos are monetized. Meaning he makes money from Youtube to post it and advertise his child human trafficking ring.</p>

<p>This is a huge child trafficking ring and if you look at the Youtube pages has thousands of subscribers. This is beyond sick</p>

<p>Voat thread I posted on it: <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2098047">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2098047</a></p>

<p>EDIT: Reddit banned me from R conspiracy on grounds of &quot;doxxing&quot; (showing you all the child sex traffiking ring on Youtube) and calling EricCarver a pedo. I have tried an appeal to ban and have come on def ears from the moderators. I can no longer write any more posts or make any more threads and will be on Voat. This will be my last comment and final appearance on Reddit. If you want to see more of my work here is my page Voat page <a href="https://voat.co/user/gamepwn">https://voat.co/user/gamepwn</a> and my Youtube channel which I will be posting my own research topics soon. (The channel is usually dedicated to apocalyptic fiction and gaming(nerdy I know), but with how fast it&#39;s been picking up figured I would use it to fight these monsters) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/gamepwn/featured">https://www.youtube.com/user/gamepwn/featured</a> Thank you. Keep fighting the good fight. It&#39;s time for me to be done with Reddit since now I am banned from sharing anymore or even making comments.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>@ EricCarver, why don&#39;t you just cut to the chase and tell us if you think adults interacting with children in a sexual manner should be legal or illegal?  You are expending alit of time and energy saying this post should not be posted in r/conspiracy.  I would argue that grown men conspiring with each other to take advantage of defenseless children is the epitome of conspiracy.  Either you are a nambla apologist or you think conspiracy should be limited to blurry photos of Bigfoot and streaky UFOs.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I know. I had you RES tagged negatively, but then saw you around in some other places where I would assume you wouldn&#39;t be, so it made me rethink my stance... but then I see this, and I&#39;m confused again. </p>

<p>You&#39;re getting the benefit of the doubt, and I think I understand why you&#39;re doing what you&#39;re doing in this thread  (preventing doxxing to prevent the community from being shut down) but yeah... it still kind of reads like suppression. </p>

<p>This is a big topic around here, which you&#39;re well aware of. People want to talk about it because it sickens them, and it needs to be revealed. The only way we can do that is if we make posts like these. </p>

<p>I hope you get where I&#39;m coming from. </p>

<p>Keep digging. Model reveals modeling is just high end prostitution. So child modeling services probably the same. Women Olympic gymists report molestation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for posting this. Even though trafficking has just begun to come to the forefront of societal discourse on issues, many still do not understand how often this happens, even within the country you live in. This is not just an issue that plagues developing countries. Trafficking affects people everywhere. 
What angers and bothers me is the fact that, at least where I live in the U.S., the mainstream media often stays silent. Especially when accusations involve the elite and/or wealthy. We need to band together as human beings to fight this. Solutions must come from all countries and fields such as law enforcement, government/world leaders, businesses, religious leaders, social workers, just to name a few. We all have a part to play. Keep speaking out. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay in <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=QmdJdcnF1t4">this fuckin video</a> you linked he reveals himself over and over. He talks about making &quot;filler&quot; videos for the public that the &quot;sponsors&quot; don&#39;t like because they attract &quot;trolls.&quot; This guy seems like a weak link in their chain.</p>

<p>Notice he films how much everything costs. After all, you don&#39;t want to pay that McDonald&#39;s bill when you&#39;re being sponsored! Gotta have proof of payment, just like the IRS demands. Speaking of the IRS, maybe they&#39;d be interested in this. </p>

<p>Notice he also talks about meeting some kind of Philippine government group... its at around 3:30, maybe a few seconds afterwards.</p>

<p>I&#39;m amazed your post here and on voat hadn&#39;t garnered the sheer unbridled fury I&#39;m feeling. </p>

If it&#39;s the latter I don&#39;t understand why the suggestions here are so useless. Tell a youtube channel? Post on Voat? These are useless suggestions, if it&#39;s pedophile ring like you people say why are you not contacting the Department of Justice? Do you not have sex tourist laws in the USA? Contact the Phillpines consulate. Contact the real media even. Posting on Voat just makes me think it&#39;s not real. </p>
