<p>As several other people do I try to copy/paste the truth about it, the hidden censorship laws.</p>

<p>&quot;Net Neutrality&quot; is a term that has been used and re-used in several contexts; &quot;Net Neutrality&quot; for the sake of this discussion is the most recent revision attempted in 2015. Therefore for this conversation &quot;net neutrality&quot; <strong>strictly means the 2015 revisions</strong>, &quot;net neutrality&quot; from any time before this is irrelevant and a distraction.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On February 26, 2015, the FCC ruled in favor of net neutrality by reclassifying broadband as a common carrier under Title II of the Communications Act of 1934 and Section 706 of the Telecommunications act of 1996.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://transition.fcc.gov/Reports/1934new.pdf">A pdf overview of those acts is here</a>, and added is the relevant section;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Whoever.... in interstate or foreign communications--  <strong>by means of a telecommunications device knowingly-- makes, creates, or solicits, and (ii) initiates the transmission of</strong>, any comment, request, suggestion, proposal, image, or other <strong>communication which is obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, or indecent</strong>, with intent to annoy, abuse, threaten, or harass another person..... </p>

<p>...<strong>shall be fined under title 18, United States Code, or imprisoned not more than two years, or both.</strong></p>

<p>Let me be respectful for a moment; I don&#39;t have time to read all that. I already read a separate pdf and clearly linked the PDF to the law, and quoted from that law the concerning sections.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You&#39;re basically just saying you&#39;re cool with monopolies we have as long as the government have &quot;controls&quot; in place for them (key word here), not the fact that they have those monopolies and destroy competition. We need competition in the markets, not shit companies, with the illusion of control mechanisms. That&#39;s counterproductive, just like when you go and &quot;vote&quot; for the next CEO of the US Corporation.. The free market will always beat government regulations. Corporate monopolies love regulations because it always strangles their smaller competitors.</p>

<p>That&#39;s the real discussion we should be having, but the masses are ignorant.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t see the contradictions. The user started by refering to someone elses point of view to begin their point. This makes no difference to Putin_loves_cats point. </p>

<p>If the rich companies can lobby the government most effectively because they have most money then they dictate policy yes?</p>

<p>They can then choose to make this policy work very well for them and shit for any other business; Putin_loves_cats thinks this is bad because it removes competition and creates a monopoly. This is a rational point of view because a company with no business can market an overpriced product of little value and customers have no other option except not to buy.</p>

<p>The illusion of control is created by these regulations that are dictated by the lobbying corporations. The politicians can turn to us and say &quot;don&#39;t worry, we&#39;ve put these special regulations in place to stop anyone taking advantage of the public who we serve&quot; when in fact the regulations exist to allow just that.</p>

<p>The point about &quot;voting&quot; for the CEO of the US corporation was a sarcastic point about the government not being a government at all but rather a proxy for corporate control. </p>

<p>Since i&#39;ve explained how these regulations can be detrimental it shouldn&#39;t take much to understand why a free market might be better.</p>

<p>It wasn&#39;t a junk comment at all. Might have needed reading between the lines a little but it didn&#39;t take much. No contradictions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not so great at economics but i think i understand what you mean, you&#39;re right that a free market isn&#39;t an answer. I suppose in practical terms unregulated markets and regulatory-captured-markets (?) aren&#39;t different because there are those who clearly have had an agenda to control the market and this would have happened regardless.</p>

<p>If i think about my opinion i wouldn&#39;t want the removal of regulations but i would want overhauls of many to see if they influenced the market in favour of any company that became a monopoly and if that was done in an unconstitutional way. </p>

<p>Maybe revert that and allow previously supressed companies to fill the void left by the removed company. Both the regulations and the companies remain if are in accordance with the constitution.
I&#39;m being idealistic but if i was given the chance that&#39;s how i&#39;d like it to be.</p>

<p>You&#39;d have to be paranoid like I am, but given the effort many corporations have taken to subtly censor and manipulate their content for political reasons (especially google and facebook) the precense of this censorship ability, while possibly a coincidental addition, is very disturbing. ESPECIALLY seeing as how hard facebook/google are pushing for &quot;net neutrality&quot;.</p>

<p>Given the other circumstances too; remember the gigantic TPP which almost went through? It was so long virtually no one was able to read it (IF THEY SAW IT AT ALL because it was held under lock and key) so I would argue the fine print is very important.</p>

<p>We already had the Net Neutrality bill which provided &quot;net neutrality&quot;.
Corporations want to change this bill; they&#39;ve dressed this up with the facade of &quot;giving companies freedom from the US government <del>to censor what they want</del>&quot;.</p>

<p>Opposing this is the side which believes that the government should have the freedom to tell the companies that they do not have the freedom to censor what they want.</p>
