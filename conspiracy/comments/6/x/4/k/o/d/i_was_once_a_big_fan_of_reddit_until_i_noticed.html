All with some question like &quot;hey guys did you hear about this?  What do you think about it?&quot;  This is not the first account like this that I have seen only the latest.

Who knows, but I generally feel sad for the future of this world where children will grow up thinking the news is reliable when pretty much everything thrown at them is designed to get them to think a certain thought or illicit a certain reaction.  This is why the alternative media exist, but even they sell out if they get to big.  Corbett report has been my go to for a long time </p>

<p>These bots get top comment so that anyone reading the posts instantly sees what they write and because it has the most &quot;upvotes&quot; they instantly think it&#39;s the status quo and are more inclined to think that way themselves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I imagine it must be a combination of both. A certain percentile would be people so they can make claims and arguments but a massive amount of bots must be needed to push them to the top.</p>

<p>Not sure if you read it but a post from a day or two ago someone would reply the people they thought were shills and have a link in the message that would phish their IP and he would let them know this. Real people took between 5 and 10 minutes to click the link but there was an astronomical amount that would click it instantaneously. It brings to question if they&#39;re dealing with actual people or bots or some sort of AI. </p>

<p>firstly decide what  YOU want to read , secondly ignore BS artists and dont comment / up vote them .</p>

<p>freewill means you have choice </p>

<p>you have a mind of your own . dont let any one sway you into their way of thinking , you are unique , be unique , not a sheep , this is how they take freedom . </p>

<p>intelligence - to be a sentient being means you are intelligence and can think for your self . make your own decisions , ignore me , ignore them but do so with free will .</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They made this topic. That&#39;s when doing something. There&#39;s not much one individual can do about this problem. A person can block toxic users, but that doesn&#39;t solve the problem for everyone else. Ultimately, I think just frequently taking about this problem in frank terms is the best thing we can do, to ensure that people at least notice this stuff going on. </p>
