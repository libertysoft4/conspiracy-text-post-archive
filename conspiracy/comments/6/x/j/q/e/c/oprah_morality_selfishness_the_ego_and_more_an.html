<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>

<p>I used to watch Oprah every single day after school. I especially loved her philosophical episodes about God and her depressing episodes that certainly appealed to the pathos of her audience, including me. Oprah is charismatic, and honestly, I would even say she used to be one of my idols. </p>

<p>While Oprah no longer hosts her famous talk show, her power and influence have shaped millions (and will continue to do so). 
Oprah is not surprisingly one of the richest self-made women in America:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbespr/2017/05/17/forbes-announces-2017-list-of-americas-richest-self-made-women/#7fee1463a4a18">https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbespr/2017/05/17/forbes-announces-2017-list-of-americas-richest-self-made-women/#7fee1463a4a18</a></p>

<p>When a person has that much prominence, there is no doubt that they have an enormous impact on society. While I used to admire Oprah, I now am suspicious of her agenda and motives, and I’d like to discuss that in this post. This post isn’t solely about Oprah, but rather, it is more about what Oprah represents in modern day society.</p>

<p><strong>Eckhart Tolle</strong></p>

<p>Oprah’s views have transformed over the years, but one prominent guest she has had on her show has been Eckhart Tolle, and he seems to encompass her views on a large scale.  He is known as the most popular spiritual author in the United States, and he is the author of the “The Power of Now” and “A New Earth.”</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eckhart_Tolle">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eckhart_Tolle</a></p>

<p>While at first glance, there seems to be nothing “wrong” with Tolle’s views, I wonder if they are deceptive. First of all, I do not disagree with his emphasis on focusing on the “now.”</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AoiWPCgjXg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AoiWPCgjXg</a></p>

<p>There is obviously truth in the fact that we can only change the present moment, and we cannot necessarily focus on the past or the future. </p>

<p>However, when Oprah asks what happens we when die, he says, “I don’t give it any thought.”</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07mOIuEqr7U">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07mOIuEqr7U</a></p>

<p>This is where I grow suspicious. In fact, I will argue that perhaps death is the most important question humans can ever contemplate. </p>

<p>I do not know all the answers, but I do know that the material world ultimately is not what it seems. I said this before, and I’ll say it again, but 99% of matter is emptiness. If everything is mostly empty, there has to be some truth, and it is not in the material world we focus on. This leads me to believe that there is a truth beyond our physical bodies, and maybe it is not “Death” that is important, but rather, it is important that we transcend our physical world to focus on spiritual elements. </p>

<p>As you probably know, reality does not even exist until it is measured:</p>

<p><a href="http://newatlas.com/quantum-theory-reality-anu/37866/">http://newatlas.com/quantum-theory-reality-anu/37866/</a></p>

<p>So, is he wrong? Absolutely not – but I still think there is something lacking in his belief system, and we have to remember, that millions of people follow this belief system, some only because Oprah has promoted it. But, still, there are some more suspicious items to address.</p>

<p><strong>Why Would God Not Want Us to Prosper?</strong></p>

<p>In many episodes, Oprah proclaims her issues with Christianity. She says there are many pathways to God, and that is certainly a common new age belief:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb2RUpMDk34">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb2RUpMDk34</a></p>

<p>Oprah discusses her views a lot, but one view stood out to me this morning. She says something along the lines of, “Why wouldn’t God want us to prosper?” What she is asking is why wouldn’t God want us to have material wealth?</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vd9DDH2A5o">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vd9DDH2A5o</a></p>

<p>This is where I knew something was up. Now, at this point in my writing, what I want you to do is understand that I do not have any issue where anybody comes from spiritually. I have been an atheist, an agnostic, an anti-theist, and a Buddhist. I never feel I have a right to judge somebody’s place on their spiritual journey. However, just for a moment, let’s really think about what ALL religions/spiritual views say about material wealth:</p>

<p>*Christianity:</p>

<p>Matthew 6:19-21 
“Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal, but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves do not break in and steal. For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t forget Matthew 19:24: Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.&quot;</p>

<p>*Buddhism:</p>

<p>Buddhism teaches about non-attachment and the fleetingness of success, wealth, fame, etc.:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/lewis-richmond/buddhism-success-third-metric-_b_3732140.html">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/lewis-richmond/buddhism-success-third-metric-_b_3732140.html</a></p>

<p>*Islam:</p>

<p>There are five Islamic teachings that show that wealth his not of the utmost importance:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.zakat.org/en/five-essential-islamic-teachings-on-wealth/">https://www.zakat.org/en/five-essential-islamic-teachings-on-wealth/</a></p>

<p>*Even philosophies such as Taoism discuss wealth and greed and desire (and view them as mostly negative):</p>

<p><a href="http://www.taoistic.com/taoquotes/taoquotes-09-desire-wealth-greed.htm">http://www.taoistic.com/taoquotes/taoquotes-09-desire-wealth-greed.htm</a></p>

<p>The point is that most major philosophies of the world say that we must not be bogged down by material things, and for good reason –  As my mom always said, “Can’t take it with you!” Yet, Oprah feels upset that God does not want her to materialistically prosper.</p>

<p><strong>Can Money Buy Happiness?</strong></p>

<p>Let’s really think about this though. Can money buy happiness? I want to be clear that I do not think poverty is the only pathway (or even a pathway?) to God. According to Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, we all have basic needs that need to be met, but once those needs are met, we seek other levels of need:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/maslow.html">https://www.simplypsychology.org/maslow.html</a></p>

<p>I am sure you have heard about lottery winners. After they win, they have a peak level of happiness, but then that level returns to the baseline level before winning. Studies show that winning the lottery does not make anybody happier:</p>

<p><a href="http://nymag.com/scienceofus/2016/01/classic-study-on-happiness-and-the-lottery.html">http://nymag.com/scienceofus/2016/01/classic-study-on-happiness-and-the-lottery.html</a></p>

<p>And study after study after study shows that money does not buy happiness:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.livescience.com/10881-global-study-money-buy-happiness.html">https://www.livescience.com/10881-global-study-money-buy-happiness.html</a></p>

<p>What it seems to me is that we all have basic, essential needs that we need for happiness, but after that, excessive material wealth is not really fulfilling. Perhaps it is temporarily fulfilling (like a drug), but other than that, it doesn’t lead to permanent happiness.</p>

<p>Again, though, Oprah is upset. She does not understand why God would not want us to “prosper” materialistically. It seems as though God would want us to prosper spiritually, which would mean we could not hold attachment to materialistic things. In other words, even if many do not believe in God, they surely worship money, possessions, fame, etc. Everybody has a form of God, even if they do not think so.</p>

<p>I used to have a friend named Richie (we no longer talk). He told me this story:</p>

<p>“I was hanging out with my atheist friend, and he refused to tip the waitress. I told him, ‘You claim you have no God, but clearly your God is money.’” </p>

<p>That always stuck with me.</p>

<p>You might be saying, “I already know this,” but the problem is our lives are dictated by money, and even if we do know this, gentle reminders are important. We know it, but do we live it?
No matter what your spiritual beliefs, it appears the worship of money is not going to lead to any real sense of fulfillment. Sorry Oprah.</p>

<p><strong>All Ways are Pathways to God?</strong></p>

<p>Here is probably the controversial part of my post. First and foremost, even if you do believe there are many pathways to God (meaning a Buddhist, a Muslim, and a Christian (or whoever!) could all find the same truth), I want you to consider a few things. </p>

<p>We literally have the most POWERFUL people in the world sharing this view – that we should all embrace this new age religion. There are NO prominent Christian leaders except maybe the false preachers on TV. While many claim this is a Christian nation (and it’s not), I want you to think about who truly has an influence on youth: celebrities. On top of that, the only Christians we ever hear about are the ones who are doing badly. Yet charitable giving is done most by the American religious (particularly Christians), yet you never hear about that in the news:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.americamagazine.org/content/unconventional-wisdom/blue-states-get-dinged-almanac-american-philanthropy">https://www.americamagazine.org/content/unconventional-wisdom/blue-states-get-dinged-almanac-american-philanthropy</a></p>

<p>I’m not asking you to think that all Christians are great, or anything like that. I am just asking you think about what <em>is</em> being promoted in pop culture. So let’s see:</p>

<p>*Stephen Hawking says there is no God:</p>

<p><a href="https://owlcation.com/humanities/Stephen-Hawking-Says-There-Is-No-God-Heres-Why">https://owlcation.com/humanities/Stephen-Hawking-Says-There-Is-No-God-Heres-Why</a></p>

<p>*Many celebrities openly deny Christianity (Brad Pitt, Katy Perry, etc.):</p>

<p><a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/brad-pitt-katy-perry-back-christian-beliefs/story?id=13620940">http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/brad-pitt-katy-perry-back-christian-beliefs/story?id=13620940</a></p>

<p>But there are tons of celebrity Buddhists (doesn&#39;t that seem contradictory?):</p>

<p><a href="https://dhammawiki.com/index.php?title=List_of_Celebrity_Buddhists">https://dhammawiki.com/index.php?title=List_of_Celebrity_Buddhists</a></p>

<p>The point here is not whether you agree Christianity sucks or not. I’m sure many reading hate Christianity. I am asking you, what do they promote? </p>

<p><em>Let me repeat that. I am not asking whether or not you agree with Christianity. You can think it is the dumbest religion in the world – but again, what is pop culture promoting?</em></p>

<p>Certainly, there is a rise of new age religion, moral relativism, atheism, and even Satanism. </p>

<p>*There is a rise of new age spirituality in a secular society:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.scienceonreligion.org/index.php/news-research/research-updates/561-the-rise-of-new-age-spirituality-in-secular-society">http://www.scienceonreligion.org/index.php/news-research/research-updates/561-the-rise-of-new-age-spirituality-in-secular-society</a></p>

<p>*Witchcraft is making a comeback:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.artsy.net/article/artsy-editorial-why-witchcraft-is-making-a-comeback-in-art">https://www.artsy.net/article/artsy-editorial-why-witchcraft-is-making-a-comeback-in-art</a></p>

<p>*Atheism is on the rise:</p>

<p><a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/04/160422-atheism-agnostic-secular-nones-rising-religion/">http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/04/160422-atheism-agnostic-secular-nones-rising-religion/</a></p>

<p>*And there are even after school Satan clubs:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/an-after-school-satan-club-could-be-coming-to-your-kids-elementary-school/2016/07/30/63f485e6-5427-11e6-88eb-7dda4e2f2aec_story.html?utm_term=.3ec4d4663b04">https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/an-after-school-satan-club-could-be-coming-to-your-kids-elementary-school/2016/07/30/63f485e6-5427-11e6-88eb-7dda4e2f2aec_story.html?utm_term=.3ec4d4663b04</a></p>

<p>So, the majority seem to be promoting this new age view of “many pathways – one love”, and all I am asking you do is to question it.</p>

<p>Going back to Oprah, she certainly promotes this new age view of spirituality, and many are following.</p>

<p>And before you comment there are some prominent Christian leaders, I will say those are false teachers. Even the Pope is trying to unite us all under “one world religion”. This link is just one example, but there are many more: </p>

<p><a href="http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/in-first-video-message-pope-francis-stresses-unity-we-are-all-children-of-god-39381/">http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/in-first-video-message-pope-francis-stresses-unity-we-are-all-children-of-god-39381/</a></p>

<p>What if there are not many pathways to God, but only one? Are we all being deceived? Again, it does not matter what you believe at this point; rather, it is just a matter of questioning motives. When you have the largest, most influential people in society promoting something, don’t you wonder why? </p>

<p><strong>Happiness</strong></p>

<p>Do whatever makes you happy! That seems to be the modern societal philosophy, and Oprah certainly promotes that philosophy. It kind of makes me laugh when I hear about excessively rich people explaining what happiness is…or should be. I have become disillusioned with it. I feel that happiness is important, but it is not necessarily the end goal to life. And, seriously, when you hear about the extremely wealthy talking about happiness, doesn’t it just make you…insert adjective here. It doesn’t make sense to me. </p>

<p>When we only focus on happiness, we start to lose our morality. Today, so much is justified through “just be happy.” Let me explain:</p>

<p>*The men who live as dogs? Just do what makes them happy!:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/may/25/secret-life-of-the-human-pups-the-men-who-live-as-dogs">https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/may/25/secret-life-of-the-human-pups-the-men-who-live-as-dogs</a></p>

<p>*A 3 year old transitioning from Jack to Jackie? Just do what makes them happy!:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2015/07/04/419498242/at-age-3-transitioning-from-jack-to-jackie">http://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2015/07/04/419498242/at-age-3-transitioning-from-jack-to-jackie</a></p>

<p>*Paris Hilton has a $325,00 dog mansion? Just do what makes her happy!:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.treehugger.com/sustainable-product-design/untreehugger-paris-hiltons-325000-dog-mansion.html">https://www.treehugger.com/sustainable-product-design/untreehugger-paris-hiltons-325000-dog-mansion.html</a></p>

<p>Quite frankly, I’m tired of it. We are telling people that no matter what they do, it is good, as long as it makes them happy. (By the way, there are way more examples of this, but you get the point).
That is Oprah Morality. Oprah says to live for yourself and do what makes you happy. In fact, that is the very key to Satanic doctrine:</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_Satan">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_Satan</a></p>

<p>Whether you think Satan is real or not is not really important. To me, whether Satan is real or not, it is <em>selfishness</em> that defines Satanism. What Oprah Morality is…it’s a culture of selfishness. </p>

<p><strong>Service to Others</strong></p>

<p>Study after study shows that true happiness comes from service to others. In fact, I would claim that helping and servicing others is the opposite of selfishness (humility) and the true worship of God. There are thousands of articles about how helping others is the true secret to happiness:</p>

<p><a href="http://time.com/4070299/secret-to-happiness/">http://time.com/4070299/secret-to-happiness/</a></p>

<p>Before you chime in and tell me about all the famous people helping others, note a few things:</p>

<p>1)  Some do it for publicity/fame
2)  Most get back their money through taxes
3)  The money they donate is minute compared to their actual income</p>

<p>However, I do not want to take away from their giving, but this does lead me to my next point. The Freemasons (many prominent celebrities and political leaders fall into this category) believe that one should give, but only if it does not require any actual sacrifice. However, most Christians (and other denominations) believe that true giving requires sacrifice. If you are interested in hearing more, here is a post I wrote about the Freemasons:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5w5gfw/there_is_a_lot_of_speculation_about_freemasonry/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5w5gfw/there_is_a_lot_of_speculation_about_freemasonry/</a></p>

<p>The point is that I do not think the point of life is living for oneself, or that helping others is solely done to benefit oneself. I feel the true pathway to God is to help others, which at times means a sacrifice to oneself. </p>

<p><strong>Selfishness</strong></p>

<p>Even if you would like to dismiss this entire post, let’s just think about what I am really trying to say. Selfishness is promoted constantly in our society – not just by Oprah. </p>

<p>This is where the lines seem to get blurred though. I am not saying that some source of selfishness isn’t required for existence. I think that we all have to put ourselves first in order to survive. This could become political, and I think you can see where I am going. Many equate being kind and helping others to some sort of strange society where are all perfectly equalized…and I’m not really saying that. </p>

<p>In fact, I actually want to counteract everything I have ever heard. I think the ego holds some importance, despite many ‘new age’ practices saying we should have no ego at all. I think this is where people get misled. In their efforts to create a better world, they completely lose themselves. I am not asking people to lose themselves.</p>

<p>Rather, I am asking people to examine their beliefs, and perhaps, start trying to do good for others. It is really a simple concept. I am asking people to do good for others, when at times, it means sacrifice for themselves. I am not asking people to give up their wealth or family or life. That’s where I think people become mistaken.</p>

<p>At the same time, I am asking people to evaluate their attachments and their ego. The ego is necessary, but that does not mean it is ‘good’ or ‘bad.’ The ego is who we are, and we can make it good or bad. Many religions have painted the ego as the ‘devil’, but I think they are dismissing a true Satanic force that feeds off of our egos.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>I think that you can see that this post isn’t <em>really</em> about Oprah, but rather, it’s just another reflection of modern society. Modern society tells us that happiness is all that matters, and that we shouldn’t even concern ourselves with matters of death. Do what makes you happy, right?! </p>

<p>I wanted to lead to a darker conclusion here. I often here there is God in all things – that all things have an aspect of ‘good’ or ‘God.’ It is kind of that hippie, new age philosophy that sounds good and feels good.</p>

<p>I am wondering if there is something truly separate from God, and I think evil does exist. Moral relativism says there is no evil. 
When I was writing this, I was trying to think of the most evil thing I could think of, and it was that fact that there are some out there that rape children. Even that is difficult for me to write. Is God in that? Is that ‘good?’ </p>

<p>I would say NO – that is not Godly and that is not GOOD. That would be my argument against moral relativism. That is my argument against “We are all God and stuff.”</p>

<p>I do not want to end on a dark note though (though that’s pretty damn dark).</p>

<p>C.S. Lewis said, “Jesus Christ did not say, &quot;Go into all the world and tell the world that it is quite right&quot;</p>

<p>Isn’t that why we are all here? We KNOW something is wrong with the world. No matter what your beliefs, we are all here reading this for a reason. We are tired of the world, and we want to do what’s right.</p>

<p>As always, it takes me a long time to write these posts. I understand that I do have a Christian bias, but even if you remove that, I think you can see the points of my post. Do not attack because you disagree. Rather, discuss! :D</p>

<p>I used to work for The Charlotte Hornets. Michael Jordan owns them. Buncha weird shit there ... (none I can prove as pictures weren&#39;t allowed so a post on it is kinda worthless IMO) not the least of which are random quotes painted on walls throughout the bowels of the arena by various successful people. And by successful I mean Warren Buffet, Henry Kissinger, Hillary Clinton, Bill Gates ... you get the picture. </p>

<p>Anyhow, Oprah had more quotes than anyone else, and it wasn&#39;t even close. Odd. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very fascinating post OP. I&#39;ll try to react in a substantive way for you.</p>

<p>What you say concerning Oprah, and her questioning why God doesn&#39;t want us to be wealthy, stems from her own misunderstanding of the belief systems. The Bible, Quran, etc. don&#39;t say not to become wealthy, they say not to make wealth the <em>objective goal</em> of ones&#39; life. Being wealthy is fine, it is what you do with that wealth, and how you acquire it, that ultimately matters.</p>

<p>Her teacher saying that to focus on the now is to avoid thinking about death also seems foolish to me. Is not focusing on the now born solely out of belief that nothing comes after death? Why only focus on the present, unless ultimately death truly is on your mind, because there is nothing afterwards? I feel he has a pretty large gap in his own logic there. What he said, and you touched upon, that we can not effect the future or change the past, are true only in certain senses. We can <em>learn</em> from the past, we can <em>plan</em> for the future, and <em>improve</em> it, by living our lives as best we can in the present, and as you said, in <em>serving others</em>.</p>

<p>This ties in to our societies penchant for seeking happiness. It is interesting that it seems to stem ultimately from Crowley&#39;s Thelema, whose ultimate rule, the self proclaimed law, as he said, of our new Aeon- &quot;Do What Thou Wilt&quot; seems truly to embody our modern society, whether by design or coincidence. As you said, on the surface this seems great, and to an extent it is necessary for some base level of happiness, but doing only what one wills can mean the sacrificing, harming, and otherwise neglecting of others. I think this is an interesting place to tie back into Oprah&#39;s&#39; guru- if there is nothing after death, then what truly matters? Would it not be our friends, our family, our human brothers and sisters who we share this conscious existence with? We can not possibly live a fulfilling life without them, yet we are told to neglect them all if it makes us happy. But how can one be happy if they are ultimately alone, bereft of all companionship deeper than surface level?</p>

<p>Regarding selfishness, I believe you are on to something. We must serve others in order to better not only ourselves, but our friends and family. We CAN change the future if we leave this earth a better place than we left it, even if there is nothing after death. This focus on nihilism is incredibly toxic in my opinion, and leads ultimately to the degradation of society as a whole. How can Civil Society function if everyone is only in it for themselves? Must a functioning society not ultimately require the giving, in some form, of ones&#39; self for others?</p>

<p>I believe this selfishness is also somewhat baked into the system. Capitalism, our predominant governing system for the last 500 years, has been taught as the selfish acquisition of wealth and power. Greed is good, Money is God, and to have wealth is to acquire power and be happy. I believe this system MUST be tempered by a more social, communal outlook. We must be aware of the limits of selfishness.</p>

<p>I also believe that this selfishness stems from a misunderstanding of evolution and its misapplication to Social Darwinism. Humans were NEVER solo creatures, the Individual didn&#39;t spring into existence. Our Pre-human ancestors survived by working together. I believe consciousness sprang from love, from the unconditional love a mother shows her baby, this love isn&#39;t taught, it is given, and it is received and internalized by the child. Generations, eons of this reinforcement, I believe, helped to awake a social consciousness in our pre-human ancestors that lead us to where we are today. Yet in school, what are we taught? Survival of the fittest. We are taught that we came from warlike and savage apes, instead of peaceful and loving Bonobos (which to me is a far more likely candidate for being similar to our ancestors).</p>

<p>Ultimately we must be able to give ourselves to others if we wish to change the future, to make the world a better place for our children. Thinking in the now to me also means living for others, with an eye on making the future better by making <em>now</em> better, and by working for and with others. I believe that evil does exist, even if we as a species can not collectively call it, we can <em>feel</em> it, as you said for example with child abuse. We KNOW that robbing one of that innocence, of destroying ones mind, is a fundamentally EVIL act, it speaks to the deepest parts of our psyche, which is again why I believe ultimately that human consciousness arose from the love of a mother for her child, a love the mother didn&#39;t understand but freely gave, and which became internalized by the descendants over the millennia as the mind grew and changed in reception of this love instinct.</p>

<p>Fantastic, thought provoking post OP. Thank you. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is one of the reasons I said what I did about Bonobos. The females control the society, so much so that a males standing is determined by his mothers in the hierarchy if the Tribe, and the females select their own mates, while the entire Tribe pitches in to raise the children. A baby bonobo doesn&#39;t leave it&#39;s mothers back for the first <em>5 years</em> of its&#39; life. It forms an intense bond. Bonobos also use sex to settle disputes with one another, and do not kill other Bonobo tribes. Often when Bonobo tribes come across each other, they mate. </p>

<p>I used to be a devout atheist, but one day I realized something was wrong, and evil is real. Moral relativism is not evil itself, but it&#39;s on the path to it. And you hit it on the head, they are trying to make a world where everything is permissible, where nothing is wrong. Where <em>you</em> are the bad one if you try to say anything is fucked up. &quot;Quit killing my fun, I&#39;m just being me!&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As a fellow Christian, I&#39;m thankful that you came to Jesus, and did stop paying attention to false-teachers (celebrities, successful people in society, politicians, etc).</p>

<p>I hate to bring this up in a very positive post, but in a way this is positive.  According to the Holy Bible, life will get worse and worse until Jesus and His Father fix this.  As such, for the remaining time we have, the most selfless acts one can do now is to bring as many fence-sitters to Jesus before time is done.</p>

<p>Material will be no more (even the planet will be remade in 1007+ years), yet if you are able to bring one or more to Jesus and Heaven, the effects will last eternally, no matter the space we are given (such as this Earth or the new Jerusalem and Earth).</p>

<p>Luke 21:34-41
&quot;“Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away. No one knows about that day or hour, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father. As it was in the days of Noah, so it will be at the coming of the Son of Man. For in the days before the flood, people were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, up to the day Noah entered the ark; and they knew nothing about what would happen until the flood came and took them all away. That is how it will be at the coming of the Son of Man. Two men will be in the field; one will be taken and the other left. Two women will be grinding with a hand mill; one will be taken and the other left.”</p>

<p>God bless.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re never alone with Jesus and His Father, never.  Even when you are persecuted (hated, bullied, hit/assulted, mocked, etc), they are in reality doing that action against God the Son and God the Father plus you.</p>

<p>Can you imagine that?  It&#39;s amazing and awe-inspiring.  God and Jesus actually let themselves along with you to be hurt (physically, mentally, and emotionally) in the hopes of bringing as many as possible into eternity with us all before the time is finished.  </p>

<p>And it is not wrong to want God and Jesus to handle this, for Jesus says in the book of Revelation (chapter 6, verse 10): &quot;And they cried with a loud voice, saying, How long, O Lord, holy and true, dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth?&quot;</p>

<p>Meaning God and Jesus know the wrong thrust upon us.  And they are not going to be nice this time.  Again, in Revelation, chapter 19, verse 11-16 &quot;11 Now I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse. And He who sat on him was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness He judges and makes war. 12 His eyes were like a flame of fire, and on His head were many crowns. He had a name written that no one knew except Himself. 13 He was clothed with a robe dipped in blood, and His name is called The Word of God. 14 <strong>And the armies in heaven, clothed in fine linen, white and clean, followed Him on white horses.</strong> 15 Now out of His mouth goes a sharp sword, that with it He should strike the nations. And He Himself will rule them with a rod of iron. He Himself treads the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God. 16 And He has on His robe and on His thigh a name written:</p>

<p>KING OF KINGS AND
LORD OF LORDS.&quot;</p>

<p>See you in Heaven, and back on Earth, and for eternity, awesomeness.</p>

<p>Although in and of itself it is extremely sad to lose those not apart of Jesus&#39; kingdom, however, that is their choice to go against it.  We&#39;re all sinners/criminals except the Father and the Son.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure God the Father and God the Son would rather have had all exist, but that is the gift of free will and choice that they gave us, and it is beautiful.</p>

<p>Here are some favorite Law of One quotes from Q&#39;uo:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The heart of your journey is to seek the Creator that is within you, the Creator that you are, the Creator that is all things. There can be no other way of looking upon an infinite creation of unity. The Creator took pleasure in making this, what you call creation, in order that it might know itself through the free will of each of its entities that it has created. From the Logos of every star within your skies, to the planet upon which you dwell, to each of your entities that you share the illusion with, each of you has free will to exercise however you wish. Each exercise of free will teaches the Creator more of itself, and fulfills the purpose of the illusion. Each of your actions reveals more to you of yourself, and if you are conscious of the seeking process, of the Creator itself, it is a journey of lovers, the creator loving you with unending love, you seeking and loving the Creator with a growing love. At some point, you will find the Creator, there is no other outcome for the end of this journey. At some point, the creator will know all that you know and will thank you for all that you have taught it of itself. At some point every entity within this great one infinite creation will coalesce again into unity, bringing home to the Creator the fruits of this journey through the octave of densities in which you now travel. Q&#39;uo transcripts September 4, 2016</p>
</blockquote>

<p>as well as </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Let us look first at the first choice and that was the choice of the Creator to know Itself. In choosing to know Itself the Creator flung from Itself innumerable and infinite sparks of love which coalesced into each awareness that dwells within the infinite awareness. Each of those sparks of awareness is the Creator, and yet, because the Creator chose free will in the manifesting of sparks of self, each spark is unique and has been unique since before time began. Each of you is eternal and in many ways immutable, a citizen of infinite nature, worth and value. Each one a holograph of the Creator and yet each one different.
Thus, the choice that birthed each of you was a choice to know the truth, to know the self, and as the Creator is love, so is each entity love. This is the central truth. This is that which does not change. Yet this is that which is ever wrapped in mystery. Each within this circle has come through many planes of existence, has learned a great deal, and each within this circle chose not only this incarnation now being experienced but also that cast of characters with whom each entity interacts in the family, in the close associations of friends, and all those who have significant connections with the self. There were agreements made before incarnation, most notably with the parents and those within the bonds of kinship of blood and of commonality of interest. Each difficulty, each crux that leaves one in a position of being forced to discover the self has been placed not with a hand that desires to punish but with a hand of loving self that wishes to serve ever more deeply, ever more purely. -Q&#39;uo @the_law_of_one (May 18, 1997)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Careful with Ra.  I have an extrapolated belief that it is part of the effort to control through pieces of truth.  </p>

<p>Nothing in this physical realm will being as much truth as keeping god in mind beyond it when you learn new things.  </p>

<p>These &quot;prophets&quot; of new information come from a source that you shouldn&#39;t inherently trust because it feels good and explains things in a new way. </p>

<p>New age runs deep and seeks to control the very information that we are discovering as we look at spirituality through a microscope.  </p>

<p>Christianity kept things simple and metaphoric so that the non initiated into alternate consciousness could still relate but for psychonauts the new age religion explains more. </p>

<p>The beauty is that through parable all of everything seems to be explained in the Bible.  It&#39;s almost a metaphoric codex of reality.  </p>

<p>Not saying Christianity is right and the OP is onto something because every path has been absorbed by luciferianism and the doctrines have been manipulated along the way to overshoot the goals of spirituality and instill subtle Luciferian principles through modern materialism and just a lack of well educated leaders.  </p>

<p>Education has been subverted which means genres have been subverted.  </p>

<p>The only way to the one true God of good is through vigorous skepticism of everything and keeping that idea that this is all the crust that people seek to control building ON TOP of our accessible infinite creativity.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Unfortunately I believe a &quot;new religion&quot; will be formed based on the ideas that Jesus brought.

Technology has trivialized everything and has created a bunch of fence sitters.  </p>

<p>Conspiracy activists are usually the biggest fence sitters and maybe hopefully in majority they won&#39;t bite the new age pill and wait out an organic religion based on what is true about each path and reconvene with why Christianity is robust. </p>

<p>The moral values matter and affect our physical reality and right now new ageism takes the importance out of morality and tips the spiritual person onward so far that they are inactive and selfish on a journey to stroke their ego. </p>

<p>I think we&#39;ll be okay in the end because overall people fee when human nature fades away and these new things won&#39;t be enough to sell the real feeing of being human. </p>

<p>They thrill new newness but that has worn off every decade of control so far.  We have enough aggregate data to just completely outsmart this obvious coming deception for what it is objectively. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re right m, and perhaps it&#39;s time for a renewal of sorts. The core principles of Christianity, i believe, remain consistent through the ages. It is ultimately humanistic and staunchly anti-luciferian in philosophy. Doesnt matter how much media portrayal or &#39;Christian&#39; leaders have done to damage it; the truth is there in the scriptures. The Bible says hunanity is inherently worthy and valuable; that He made us in his image, he knows us each by name, and every detail about us he knit in the womb. He wants us to be free; to engage our free will to <em>choose</em> to love him, not to deceive us into doing so. Jesus redpilled everyone and didn&#39;t sugarcoat things to get people to follow him; if anything, he set down a simple, hard path that most people weren&#39;t ready to choose in their self-centeredness, but people were thirsting for righteousness even when they didnt know it.. Satanism is the opposite, it seduces and entices and promises and flatters.. it&#39;s easy to follow... it promotes false liberty and conditional success; but the deeper you get into satanic doctrine the more spiritual bondage you will find yourself wrapped up in. Like you said, the newness wears off eventually. Satanism is the ultimate bait and switch. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s interesting you say that because I&#39;ve been thinking a lot about the cabal&#39;s obsession with words and symbolism and what that means with respect to language as we&#39;ve been taught today. Words have so much more power than we were taught. I see your point that certain &#39;religious&#39; words are definitely meant to trigger...something. I think from a Christian standpoint I see the way Satan has taken the Christian language and inverted it to glorify himself.  I&#39;ve taken to praying to YHWH and Yeshua in hopes of being more careful. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The question in the thread was why do so many people buy into the secret space program and disclosure movements?</p>

<p>I responded:</p>

<p><em>takes breath</em></p>

<p>These are both part of controlled releases of partial truths to coax humans into investigate deeper meanings of life through skepticism. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a classic counter culture movement with the end result to get people to come to a greater realization within the control of the agencies carrying out the information dumps.  </p>

<p>The symbolism aligns with much of Hollywood and MSM showcases which leads me to believe that the esoteric rich are pushing their secret knowledge onto the public from virtually every angle and have been since before WWII.  </p>

<p>We are exposed to these deeper secret religions through slow culture building through music, movies, news, corporations, etc it goes on and on.  </p>

<p>We are being primed to be led into mass confusion in order to regroup everyone with a universal truth through technology. </p>

<p>The only saving grace is the human spirit and our grassroots ability to spread truth.  We will be exposed to much disinformation but by accessing more and cross examining and having real discussions we can better understand the formulas and see the true enemy that has always been hiding in plain sight giving us everything that we love. </p>

<p>We are living out prophecy because those at the top have worked long and hard to carry out this master plan of which all religions are a part of. The evolution of humans into a controllable consciousness.  </p>

<p>But the orchestrator doesn&#39;t even exist to the profane.  This is the allure and power of a mystery. It is something known above someone else and it gives power.  We are being programmed to be enamored by mystery so that when the time comes for the mass confusion due to metaphoric language and symbolism and lack of identity due to illusion of ever expanding choice, we have a singularity. </p>

<p>The outcome will be shapen by everything we&#39;ve been experiencing because it is how we will relate to the changes.  Imagine all of he homogenized space movie societies.  They are showing us what they want us to want.  </p>

<p>Inception. </p>

<p>It&#39;s all in the media and it just takes an open mind, interest, and patience to not get caught in a dead end and Learn about what props each of the dead ends up. </p>

<p>Take mushrooms and see the source creates all of this so you will find it.  Its what the evil wants as well because it worships the same god, but the interpretation in the physical realm has been inverted to get controlled results in our world.  </p>

<p>Intent and resonance are the literal pieces that language is created from.  They affect the subliminal world around us that shape the solid structures we call reality.  </p>

<p>They are either trying to break reality to control it or end the quarantine we seem to be in through manipulation of a concept of evil.  Either way if there is existence beyond what we can see (even due to technology cloaking the skies possibly) we won&#39;t be allowed to join the ranks of a free energy universe if we are caught up in a controlled emotional landscape.  </p>

<p>With all of these kinds of media releases I think they are stoking the fires of confusion to pave the way for THEIR answers.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>More on words:  </p>

<p>Last time I did shrooms I wrote for the first time and it felt as if I was channeling.  I saw the energy behind certain words I was writing like &quot;truth&quot; and &quot;good&quot; and understood that there are pillars of the subconscious that are accessed by words and pull them into a point of interaction for us. </p>

<p>These words are crafted through years and years of refinement and all letters, words, root words all have specific and often occult intentions.  </p>

<p>We are carrying out the runes and sigils of Egypt unwittingly and unwillingly which creates the broken feeling inside of use as we attempt to find truth in an operating system designed to obfuscate it.  </p>

<p>Look at how the mainstream media operates and the way that Almo&#39;s seemingly AI humans walk around regurgitating symbols they pick up.  It keeps a false reality perpetuated due to a lack of consciousness.  </p>

<p>We are truly dealing with AI already and they&#39;ve made us believe it was something outside of ourselves all the while we&#39;ve been programmed into being what we are against our own humanity. </p>

<p>Words are weapons. I can say the word &quot;fuck&quot; a vast number of ways with each dynamic installing a different effect into the recipient. </p>

<p>Or I can ignore the word and sidestep the system.  </p>

<p>We eat drink breathe and speak artificial constructs.  When we slow down and focus on and analyze what tools we use to communicate the illusion becomes very real. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A lot of this resonates, particularly about the fact that we unwittingly regurgitate ancient symbols and occult meanings throught the spoken (and written) word.. Makes me think about the Tower of Babel and what it means when something is speaking in &#39;tongues&#39;, or spiritual language. The Bible itself is alive with ancient, mysterious truths in every word. </p>

<p>On your other comment, i definitely see the manipulation in movies and media and the blatant subliminal programming and emotional reactions these things are meant to produce. It feels like they&#39;re ramping things up towards an imminent shift, of some sort. Maybe we&#39;ve already reached it. It doesn&#39;t feel like a positive one. But despite this onslaught on our senses- all the manipulation, the obfuscation, the distortion, the control- in the end, something inside my soul knows truth will win out. There is so much more power in good, truth, courage, hope, and love than in darkness and hiding. There is so much to be said for the noble aspects of humanity and the potential we all have to be more than we&#39;ve been led to believe.</p>

<p>Commercial artists peddle the mythical narrative, one propagated by corporations, self-help gurus, <strong>Oprah</strong> and the Christian Right, that if we dig deep enough within ourselves, focus on happiness, find our inner strength, or believe in miracles, we can have everything we desire. 
Such magical thinking, a staple of the entertainment industry, blinds citizens to corporate structures that have made it impossible for families to lift themselves out of poverty or live with dignity.

    <div class="md"><p>I really enjoy posts like this.</p>

<p>You brought up a lot of valid points about how Modern Morals have really shifted towards an inward focus. I&#39;ve realized I myself have become more isolated and inwardly focused as of late, and I&#39;ve been rather stressed about a multitude of things.</p>

<p>This &quot;Do What makes you happy&quot; philosophy is great on the surface, but also gives rise to another concern I&#39;ve noticed. People want critical feedback any more. I&#39;ve noticed it more as I&#39;ve gotten older, there&#39;s a disdain for any sort of rejection. </p>

<p>If I applied this attitude to a friend who drinks in excess, would I really be a friend? Showing love to people is also about having the courage to have hard conversations like that. If you care about someone you&#39;d want to keep them from destroying themselves, despite it &quot;Making them Happy.&quot; </p>

<p>Now that I think about it, we may have to be on the look out for a kind of &quot;False Liberty&quot; ideology. &quot;Do what makes you happy&quot; could be radicalized to a degree. Though, given the few examples of Transgendered 3-year olds, and Doge Humans, I&#39;m not sure it already has not began. Though from what I&#39;ve seen, these extreme cases aren&#39;t as prominent as the media would have you believe.</p>

<p>I&#39;m also reminded of a passage in Genesis, that Jesus refers to as well.</p>

<p>Matt 24:37-39</p>

<blockquote>
<p>37 As it was in the days of Noah, so it will be at the coming of the Son of Man. 38For in the days before the flood, people were eating and drinking, &gt;marrying and giving in marriage, up to the day Noah entered the ark; 39and they knew nothing about what would happen until the flood came and &gt;took them all away.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Genesis 6:5</p>

<blockquote>
<p>5 The Lord saw how great the wickedness of the human race had become on the earth, and that every inclination of the thoughts of the human &gt;heart was only evil all the time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Your thoughts on the ego are interesting. Have you ever heard of a book called &quot;The Freedom of Self Forgetfulness?&quot; It has a Christian slant, however I think you may enjoy it. It describes the ego as a pseudo organ for humans. </p>

<p>Why would financial success not come to you for enacting God&#39;s will? Not saying it&#39;s guaranteed but why shouldn&#39;t it?</p>

<p>Why can&#39;t Oprah be successful due to the way she maintained and conducted herself?</p>

<p>I see all the time this disdain for rich people and it&#39;s always the same thing, do they deserve it, do I deserve more?</p>

<p>Happiness, wealth, these are byproducts of a wholesome fulfilled life. That is what everyone should want.</p>

<p>In order to be holistic you have to factor every component , all choices, pieces of know how, into a singular way to be.</p>

<p>My issue with this 1% group is that they control everything and have destroyed the middle class (or in the process of destroying). They want all the money and power for themselves. They occasionally donate and people commend them when in reality they should be doing so much more good with their riches. How many more cars and mansions do they need?</p>

<p>There is enough resources for every human on this planet. They control them. They isolate them. </p>

<p>So yes I definitely have a disdain for the ultra rich. Am I talking about the guy down the street with the nice house? No. I&#39;m talking about the insanely rich people in control. The 1% of the 1% really.</p>

<p>Quality of life indices include a lot of factors, such as:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Basic Human Needs, which includes medical care, sanitation, and shelter.</p></li>
<li><p>Foundations of Wellbeing, which covers education, access to technology, and life expectancy.</p></li>
<li><p>Opportunity, which looks at personal rights, freedom of choice, and general tolerance.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>It&#39;s not just about wealth.</p>

<p>Well that&#39;s the whole thing, it&#39;s an experience without evidence.  This is the kind of thing that makes religion so easy to manipulate, it&#39;s filled with beliefs that lack evidence, allowing it to be formed into whatever TPTB need at the time.</p>

<p>Well, in your post you seem to be trying to claim that through moving away from God we are warping morality and becoming worse as a society.</p>

<p>What I&#39;m saying, is that societies which have moved further away from God and religion are actually far better off in numerous indices that measure the quality of life of people in those places.  I believe that this is because religion/God are inherently subjective, with no evidence, which ultimately means that they fall prey to the weaknesses of selfishness of humanity overall.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The evidence that once was, requires faith that it did occur.  Meaning if the scriptures/evidence are true, one would&#39;ve had to live during that timeframe to &quot;know&quot; if they did or did not occur.</p>

<p>Since the last writings of the Holy Bible occurred in 95 AD, no human alive can verify the events which are considered evidence.  Which is why Christians (and other religions) rely on faith that what is written occurred.</p>

<p>And even when considering &quot;actual evidence&quot;, such as the statistics you mentioned earlier, you don&#39;t think that method and data isn&#39;t open to manipulation for the poll-takers needs?</p>

<p>So what you are saying is, I can&#39;t rely on faith that scriptures are true because I wasn&#39;t there to verify it, but I can rely on faith that statistical polls are true because I wasn&#39;t there to verify it?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is extraordinary to me, so there goes that &quot;proof&quot;.</p>

<p>Again, the scriptures of the Holy Bible state what did occur at that time, and while no human can verify those events occurred, if they are true and did occur, the events at that time were evidence.  </p>

<p>Because we are in a future time, is it possible to say there isn&#39;t any physical evidence - just like in 100 years or so (expiration age of humans who conducted and participated in the poll) it will be possible to state there was no physical evidence to your claim (there is now no evidence to suggest what they claim is true is actually proof of truth, but I digress).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Heh, I&#39;ve learned that statistics can be framed to say what one wants to say.  </p>

<p>For instance, suppose the poll-takers had a certain subject group, and the outcome was not what they wished the results to appear as.  They could then open the poll up to a new batch of poll-takers, and then add the results they deem as favorable to the results they deemed favorable to the first poll session, and a portion of the unfavorable results, thereby &quot;playing&quot; with the results to show favorable outcomes and yet still including unfavorable results (in an attempt to show that the polling was not rigged, thereby further crediting the polling method).</p>

<p>What I&#39;m saying is, trusting that the poll-takers didn&#39;t scrub the data to favor their desired outcome takes faith that the method/data/evidence is truthful.</p>

<p>Ultimately, from what I&#39;ve seen, all these entertainment-heads do when they preach righteousness is fill the heads of viewers with <em>more and more beliefs</em>. &#39;Believe this, and you will be set free.&#39; They create deeper, more complex thought prisons for people to spend lifetimes trying to escape, once they&#39;ve been built and believed in. </p>

<p>If enlightenment is truly seeing that what one is is the empty space in which one&#39;s entire understanding of life has happened, then why is it that we&#39;re basically trained to <em>search</em> and <em>seek</em> for meaning via a higher power? Why do we turn to Oprah and her bullshit? Because the mind craves beliefs. So long as the mind hold beliefs, the mind holds an identity. It&#39;s all ego. Thought prisons/prisms. It broke my heart to see my favorite teacher, Adyashanti, on Oprah only because I <em>knew</em> how misunderstood he was likely to be by the brainwashed viewers of Oprah.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Happy to. His teaching name is Adyashanti. He was born and raised in California. He tells the story of being a very aware child with an understanding of the collective insanity in adults, which he picked up on when he started noticing how emotional they were, which led to realizing that these adults were believing all of their thoughts to be true. So, he recognized that human beings hadn&#39;t generally understood that we create our experiential reality by believing our thoughts to be our selves, or just by believing our thoughts. In other words, adults were insanely emotional, which didn&#39;t make sense to Adya as a child and introduced him to the thought that there might be another &#39;way&#39; to live. So, he &#39;pursued&#39; enlightenment and found it in his late 20s, I&#39;m pretty sure. </p>

<p>Adya is fundamentally awake. I&#39;ve spent the past entire year listening to the recordings of his satsangs on Youtube, and he has helped me immensely in letting go entirely of my old paradigm of being. A lot of me wanted to hold on because I felt I was going crazy (no one in my life has ever been spiritual and no one pursues metaphysics/deeper truth/curiosity of the nature of reality...all my friends with whom I discuss these things are people I&#39;ve found via reddit, lol), and he&#39;s been a wonderful outlet to peace for me during my own chaotic journey this past year.</p>

<p>I want to add one thing. I wrote a short essay about my personal journey of discovering truth and the painful process of letting go that inevitably ensued (is ensuing still), as a means of winning a free trip to one of Adyashanti&#39;s satsangs in New York. I won, and drove up to see him run a two day retreat, which consisted mostly of satsangs, guided meditations, and personal stories from Adyashanti that he feels are most fitting for the energy in the room, paired with the task at hand (discovering emptiness through experience, rather than through intellectual understanding). On my way up to see him speak, I started having weird feelings and thoughts about how I already <em>understood</em> awakening perfectly. Intellectually, I understand the truth of what we are very well, I think. I&#39;ve spent so much time going down the internal rabbit hole -- literally taking LSD and observing my thoughts, reading endless material on consciousness and awakening and human psychology, observing how people act and why, observing desire and disgust and lack and greed, observing how this insane world we live in with its disgusting politics could develop through humanity&#39;s collective consciousness, and things of that nature -- and I started to think that I didn&#39;t need to go see Adyshanti talk. &quot;What if he lets me down?&quot; I even thought at one point. Really silly thinking. But, ultimately, what I realize I was trying to see within myself is that I was going for a <em>different</em> reason. What I mean is, I was having these thoughts about how I didn&#39;t <em>need</em> to go, but I still wanted to. Why? Well, there was one more thing I wanted to see which I could not see via audio recordings.</p>

<p>I wanted to see if Adyashanti -- an enlightened and genuinely awake human through whom Life, itself, is living without a single thought-created glitch (ego) -- <em>moves</em> differently than most people I know. I wanted to see if his body literally moved differently. I&#39;ve become fascinated by psychology and how our thoughts affect our bodies at all times, so long as you still identify with thought (Adya does not, obviously, as he has seen beyond the veil of illusion). I wanted to see if thoughtlessness resulted in a more flowing, beautiful person.</p>

<p>What I saw was what I expected: he moves <em>nothing like</em> most people I know. When the clock struck noon and Adyashanti finally came out of his personal meditation, as he was hidden within a dark room in the back of the Church we were meeting in, I was overwhelmed with energy when I saw him moving with such grace and ease. Watching him walk from the back of the Church to the front, avoiding books on the ground, observing the audience as a pure and unconditioned self, I could just tell something was &#39;different&#39;, but that difference was purity. He was not thinking about the crowd, he was just seeing us. He was not worrying about the books on the ground that were in his way as he walked to the front of the room, he just observed them and walked beyond around in the most logical route. He did not itch his body when he did not need to. He did not seem at all jumpy or anxious or flustered, as the general public so clearly does nowadays to the point where it seems almost part of our DNA to be perpetually on edge...</p>

<p>But to see him move with the grace that I saw is what provided me with the strength I&#39;d needed to let go of my own self. Seeing the freedom he embodied, and knowing that freedom came only through letting go of that which we are all so attached to, was quite a moment for me. I apologize if I was all over the place with this. He is a wonderful teacher, and I hope you give him a shot if you ever find yourself pursuing awakening. I&#39;ll leave you with a video of his that I really enjoy. Be well.</p>

<p>Except that there is zero physical evidence for the miracles the Bible claims ... that is the difference.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I believe at that time there was physical evidence for the miracles.  But again, in 100 years or so there will be zero physical evidence that the components of your statistical evidence existed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>n the case of standard of living indices, you can physically go there yourself and compare the results, replicate them, find the errors yourself.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yet you and I were both not there when and where the study was executed, nor when the results were compiled, nor when the results were published.  Yet you can say with 100% certainty that the results you see were not in any way tampered with.  That&#39;s a lot of assumptions being made by you to validate the evidence.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You can&#39;t do that with the extraordinary stories from the Bible, there is nobody out there turning water into wine that you could compare Jesus to ... you believe it on faith only, there is no evidence to support the extraordinary claims in Bible at all.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I can do that, it&#39;s the same thing.  There is nobody out in the world, that I know of, that is turning water into wine, <strong>at this time</strong>.  I do believe that there was someone in the world that turned water into wine <strong>2000 years ago</strong>.  I don&#39;t know either definitively, but I believe with faith since I cannot prove 100% either way, just like your statistical study.</p>
