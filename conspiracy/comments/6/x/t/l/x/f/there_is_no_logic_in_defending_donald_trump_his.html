        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I like many of you have been watching this presidency closely, for many reasons it has the value of a trainwreck. When Trump was first elected I was concerned but I thought he is a novice politician, more than likely his plans will stall and he will come to his wits because their are still smart people in washington that can direct him the right way. Nope, the train is off the rails yet it is still furiously moving. I want to put forth a couple topics for people to discuss, I want to hear Trump supporters opinions and I want an actual discussion. No name calling, no shill marking, hopefully brigading is kept to a minimum. Lets discuss these points like concerned citizens and hopefully we can all gain some insight on the opinions of the reddit conspiracy community.</p>

<ol>
<li>Trump lies alot.
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/06/23/opinion/trumps-lies.html">https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/06/23/opinion/trumps-lies.html</a></li>
</ol>

<p>Trump from day one has lied or stretched the truth to fit his narrative, some are harmless some are destructive and most rile up his base and is used as propaganda. Some are harmless but some are so blatant and stupid that you have to wonder if he is sane. For example he said We are going to repeal and replace Obamacare “quickly,” easily, on “day one.”
Sounds pretty stupid right? </p>

<ol>
<li>Trumps attempts to illlegitimize american institutions.</li>
</ol>

<p><a href="https://www.google.com/amp/www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/commentary/ct-donald-trump-destroy-america-20170310-story,amp.html">https://www.google.com/amp/www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/commentary/ct-donald-trump-destroy-america-20170310-story,amp.html</a></p>

<p>Not only has trump devalued the office of the president but he has put people in place that are actively seeking to destroy the offices they hold. Betsy Devos is a great example, not only is she the rich sister of Erik Prince but she has 0 qualifications to be education secretary. She has pushed hard to eliminate student loan programs and push for profit schooling and hires the last person you would want to head a fraud task force for colleges
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/ex-devry-dean-to-probe-for-profit-colleges-critics-pounce/2017/08/31/6110b522-8e76-11e7-9c53-6a169beb0953_story.html">https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/ex-devry-dean-to-probe-for-profit-colleges-critics-pounce/2017/08/31/6110b522-8e76-11e7-9c53-6a169beb0953_story.html</a> 
He is also nominating a climate denier who has never held any position of engineering or sciences to be the head of NASA. How does this make any sense at all?</p>

<ol>
<li>Trump does some dumb shit.</li>
</ol>

<p>Remember the wire tap fiasco? This exemplifies Trumps stupidity, it was a claim that was baseless, unsubstantiated and could have been simply proven true by his own actions! He could have called the fbi, asked for the wire taps and poof there is his evidence. But he picked the one thing that could be instantly proven right. Then not learning from his mistakes he does it again, threatening Comey that he recorded their conversation. And this takes the cake for stupidity for multiple reasons. 1. The recordings could back up comeys testimoney. Once trump said this the senate immediately wanted those tapes to make sure Comeys testimoney was true. 2.Trump then admits he said that to make sure that comey said the right thing! He just admitted to intimidating a witness! 3. They dont exist and now he has egg all over his face, how dumb of a plan was that! </p>

<p>Here is some other dumb stuff.</p>

<p>The joint russian cybersecurity task force. Seriously you get hacked by russians and you want to give them the key to the hen house? Wtf.

<ol>
<li><p>North Korea. Not much to explain here. Im sure everyone knows that starting war with North Korea will go down as an epic disaster.</p></li>
<li><p>Fake news. This sub loves to call out the media and play the holier than thou card when it comes to their choice in media. My point is Trump relies on news sources that are just plain devisive and straight wrong. Sites like breitbart, the daily caller, the federalist have no shame in producing news that blatantly skews information to fit their narrative. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Trump has access to the most sophisticated intelligence services in the world yet he relies on fox and friends for his news. The intelligence agencies have gone so far as to create documents that say his name asany times as possible to keep him interested and staffers have said they stick around simply to try and shutdown some of his crazy ideas.</p>

<p>Edit: Well the trump supporters have decided to insult me rather than debate the topics. Offer still stands Im willing to debate anyone on the issues. Or sling insults doesnt matter to me.</p>

<p>Edit2: got through as many comments as I could, most were insults. Only 2 people actually posted a worthwhile comment. Thanks for the insults. I expected Trump supporters to try and do a better job at defending him. Most people just wanted to tell me my sources are propaganda,  as is tradition. I wish people would attack the argument and not the source. I&#39;m disappointed.</p>

<p>First off, it&#39;s there not their.</p>

<p>That sentence was where you lost me. Not because of the error but because Washington is full of corrupt traitors. That&#39;s why people voted for Trump, they know <strong>they&#39;re</strong> all corrupt and we wanted to make their lives harder by giving them an asshole like Trump to deal with. The other reason was fuck Hillary. She belongs in prison.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Which sources you have listed is actually independent source? they are totally anti-trump whatever he has done.</p>

<p>I dont like trump for a few reasons, none of your propaganda are on my list and your thread will only makes more ppl to jump on his train. His slogan and policies are making too much sense. If you want to fight against him (whether you dislike him personally or something) you should start with the fiscal policies and sustainability of them. Even Obamacare is a disaster, his repeal is not much better, middle class familiies will still suffer. etc. Please stop the MSM non-sense. They blash Trump 24/7 for EVERYTHING he has done. 2 scolds of ice creams? is that a news? spin everything he has done. MSM should blash him when he did wrong and praise him when he did something right, otherwise, fewer will believe what they say. I dont want GOP to become too powerful and dominate, dems, please dont suck. they knew they are going to lose more seats but still keep their policies and slogans. God!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump deserves tons of criticism for actions he is wholly reponsible for. His response during charlotsville is a good example. What he said was an example of avoiding condemning his base. The media did take it too far, they labeled him this and that and put words into his mouth. But it was his choice not to condemn the actions of a white supremecist.</p>

<p>The office of the president is the most scrutinized office in the world. If you make a weird face someone will call you out, if you put dijon mustard on your hot dog fox news will cover that for 4 months. If the president releases gas any where near a mic he will get flak for a week. Its not a position for an amateur politician and Trump is learning this the hard way. You chose to avoid talking about the points i brought up because they are undeniably true. Trump makes more mistakes then any president in history and has the worst approval rating in history. Its not a conspiracy against him he is just comically outgunned.</p>

<p>white supremecist.
this is propaganda that does divide up the nation. please, use your common sense here. when is this actually bought up, it is a racist ideology. left is using nazi to end any argument and use racism to advance some elites aganda. whites do like blacks and blacks do like whites. Please unit up and fight against the 1%, elites just years ago instead of fighting each other. you know why dems keep losing, they keep pushing the agandas that nobody cares or even understand or remotely related to their every day lives.  Russia, russia, russsia, naziziziziz, now, both size of MSM are lying and no1 knows how his presidents is actually doing. CNN /MSNBC lies, now foxnews, breitbart. Freedom of speech is under threats, lefts thought they are suppress, if google turns around and censor lefts as well rights. there are so much you need to worry about than Trump and you seems know little bit about it. censorship is now everywhere. I&#39;m anti or pro trump, but dont know either side to get censor, so we can debate and know what actually are happenning. but this is getting harder and harder. stop believing MSM, and your sources. take a bigger shot at the nation and see the real threats, so from there, you know the real aganda of elites. remember the only time MSM(CNN) and hillary, MCcain praise about Trump? when he fired the missiles. know you know why more ppl are jumping in Trump&#39;s train? there are so many things are happening, whether true or false, when you get the bigger pictures, its easily for you to do the research. you cant just cite the sources from the lefties media outlets, its not credible to your claims. God bless America.</p>

It doesn&#39;t always turn out great, but every now and then something wonderful happens, so its worth a shot every time.

</blockquote>

<p>The administration is not where the power is.   Moreover, Goldman Sachs, and the rest of Wall street, that are actually running the administration have been very successful.   </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The gop have to own the Trump failure, if they dont we will not be able to learn from our mistakes and heal as a nation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The GOP is not relevant anymore.  They have been exposed as the neoconservative and neoliberal...just like their cohorts across the isle. </p>

<p>Nations do not heal.  Not only is this an anthropomorphic metaphor, it is cheap campaign rhetoric.  The only way to restore the balance of power is to smash the MIC and the intelligence community.   The guard dog has been running the house too long, it is time for a choke color. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Terrible decisions the executive makes can be held in check by the judicial branch.  The deep state has no checks on its power. </p>

<p>Agreed.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Yes.  Just a couple of years ago, Brennan for example was caught lying about the CIA spying on the Senate.   You know Brennan? one of the architects of the Russiagate narrative. </p>

<p>At this point we have had multiple high level insiders expose how this functions.  You can start with William Blum, an ex-cold-warrior.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_Hope">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_Hope</a></p>

<p>Bill Moyers had a great show on the secret government.</p>

<p><a href="http://billmoyers.com/content/secret-government-constitution-crisis/">http://billmoyers.com/content/secret-government-constitution-crisis/</a></p>

<p>He also hosted the essay by Mike Lofgren who was an ex-GOP congressional staff member.</p>

<p>Or the essay by Micheal Glennon:</p>

<p>No, there are certain facts that describe an American mentality, however, itself at this point a product of massive manipulation of discoursive mediums.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Trumps lies</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In modern political life lying is seen as a virtue. Everyone does it. Either you are against it on principle, in which case you oppose modern politics as such, or you are not opposed to it, but rather see it as an opportunity to push campaign rhetoric... something that does not belong on this sub. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>propaganda,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sure, I mean it was so easy to control what people thought when the mediums were few and centralized.   </p>

<blockquote>
<p>general leadership or lack there of do not instill the power in the population to do great things. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Leadership...installing power.... it is like listening to managerial speak from a corporate seminar.    </p>

<p>While I don&#39;t dispute your opinion, WaPo is over 100 years old, older then the CIA. Unless your going for the CIA has always been around under other names like Freemasons, but you should state that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One thing I never understood is when people point to economic growth or decline as part of our ongoing business cycle and attribute that to the president currently in office. Obama &quot;leading America out of the recession caused by bush&quot; or &quot;trump creating hundreds of thousands of jobs in his first 6 months as president&quot;. They are both bullshit statements as fiscal policy has little effect on the economy outside of massive infrastructure investment which is typically carried out at the state level these days. </p>

<p>So this false attribution of credit, I feel, is currently being applied to North Korea, which has been a pot dangerously close to boiling over for quite sometime. This narrative that trump is causing a crisis in North Korea is pretty comical, and I don&#39;t think his actions toward NK would be any different than Obama, although his words probably are. The main difference though, is the media&#39;s reaction and the propaganda being put out around it. We can either accept NK as a nuclear state, or we can put them down with massive consequences. No one has accepted NK as a nuclear power, so it&#39;s clear where we have been heading for the last 20 years, and I haven&#39;t seen any change to that except for the fact that NK went from a joke who couldn&#39;t get a missile of the ground to having ICBM capabilities with a miniaturized hydrogen bomb on it all in less than a year (do you believe that?). The only thing I know it&#39;s that our government keeps us completely in the dark until they have an agenda to push. </p>

<p>For what it&#39;s worth, I don&#39;t support Ds or Rs including trump, I&#39;m just telling it how I see it.</p>

<p>Trumps jobs and market numbers are good, and have been on the rise for the last 4 years. Trumps talk of deregulation and tax breaks have given business confidence and has had a positive effect on the markets.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/making-sense/todays-unemployment-number-fools-us-president-trump-different-reasons/">http://www.pbs.org/newshour/making-sense/todays-unemployment-number-fools-us-president-trump-different-reasons/</a></p>

<p>But that is the only effect Trump has had on the market. Trump has not passed a budget or a tax plan, it is uncertain exactly his plans are and the effect on the markets they will have. One thing is certain and that is Trump was elected during a time of growth, the markets have been trending upwards since 2009 and unemployment has fallen to its lowest points before he took office. Most of the growth is inhereted and it is too soon to tell the effect that trump will have on the markets and unemployment.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s some more bills Trump has signed to law that are morally justifiable.</p>

<p>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration Transition Authorization Act of 2017 calls for a $19.5 billion budget for NASA — an increase from $19.3 billion in 2016 — and also asks that NASA create a plan for getting humans “near or on the surface of Mars in the 2030s.”</p>

<p>Trump also signed the Weather Research and Forecasting Innovation Act of 2017, which The Washington Post described as “the first major weather legislation enacted since the early 1990s.” This bill aims to increase research into improving weather forecasts and modernize the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. David Titler, professor of meteorology at Pennsylvania State University, said, “Improving weather-related safety of our people and our assets is not political — it’s just common sense.”</p>

<p>Another bipartisan law Trump signed was the Department of Veterans Affairs Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act. This bill allows for greater ease to punish wrongdoers and gives whistleblowers more protections.</p>

<p>Trump signed the legislation on Friday, and an injured Army veteran, Michael Verardo, said at the ceremony, “Today is a new day. This administration has fulfilled its promise that the veteran is empowered and the veteran is in charge of his or her own care.”</p>

<p>The other bills, while not as consequential, still involve Trump carrying out his agenda. The American Law Enforcement Heroes Act prioritizes giving federal grants to law enforcement agencies that hire veterans. The Public Safety Officers’ Benefits Improvement Act works to reduce the time families of fallen officers have to wait to receive survivor benefits.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I applaud your effort, but you&#39;re going about this all wrong. Instead of shoving left wing media in supporters faces, you should be trying to understand how we see things. </p>

<p>First off, stop with the CNN/MSN vs Fox bs. You&#39;re only going to bring about more division with this. I&#39;m not speaking for all but I assume that the majority of supporters don&#39;t trust any of our national media outlets for many reasons. We have been falsely labeled racists and nazis for almost 2 years now. During this time we have been assaulted constantly just for having a opinion. The media normalized these actions up until now. They&#39;re the reason for the division you see not Trump. If only democrats took the time and actually did some research into the DNC&#39;s emails you would see this. The DNC were in charge of the media and had to approve things before they were aired or printed. Googles Eric Schmidt was even involved in all of this. I bet you can remember Trump supporters claiming we were being censored, these events really did happen. You can find all this information at WikiLeaks, but I know that you don&#39;t trust their 100% credibility since you think they&#39;re Russian. Don&#39;t take this as a insult, democrats and the media have been brainwashing you for sometime by constantly plugging Russia into news feeds. Constant repetition is how we learned while growing up and they&#39;re just repeating the same technique over and over again.</p>

<p>One thing that I have noticed about the left is that they tend to heavily rely on emotion when it comes to politics. This is another technique that is used to brainwash people. They try to emotionally attach you to buzzwords. This is probably why half our nation still believes we&#39;re all nazis. In reality there is about 10k nazis, kkk and white supremacists across our nation. Our media never gave any attention towards these groups that were dying out prior to 2016 why now? The media has now given these people a platform to build upon. I don&#39;t suspect their numbers will grow significantly since Charlottesville exposed them and their backwards ideals. Trump handled that situation as hew should have, denouncing both sides that brought hate and violence. Supporting communist extremists is equally as bad as supporting the groups that organized this event.</p>

<p>I know that I really haven&#39;t addressed much in your post, but I feel that understanding one another on this type of level would do our groups better in the long run. Realistically both sides share the same ideals, we just have our own opinions on how to go about these things. This whole left vs right thing is working wonders for the corrupt politicians. I don&#39;t know if you see this but both Republicans and Democrats are in on this game together. This is how Trump supporters see this. That is why we voted for a outsider that no one on the inside wanted. This is also why many are sticking beside him today. I&#39;ve have grown weary and believe that we all have been played. We&#39;re at the brink of civil war and WWIII at the same time and I believe that this is intentional. They&#39;re trying to increase their control over us with a larger police state. I don&#39;t know about you, but I do not want that. If only we could put aside our petty differences and unite, we would notice that there&#39;s no better time for a peaceful revolution than now. We need to reinvent democracy for today&#39;s times and get money out of politics, since that is the source of most of our problems today.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for your contribution to the discussion.</p>

<p>I understand the argument you make of liberal media marking republicans as racists. The white privledge argument is ridiculous and painting broad strokes in regards to racism is a flawed concept. I cant stand watching cnn and their rage panels. They just get people riled up and looking for fights. My dad is actually a Trump supporter so I have heard his arguments and we share our beliefs. He believes in Trump solely because he thinks he can be good for the markets. I disagree with that point and see that Trump has inherited most of the markets growth from the last 4 years.</p>

<p>Mostly I wanted to see how Trump supporters defend him on the topics I covered, since they are glaring inadequacies that should be addressed.</p>

<p>Thank you for contributing to the discussion and have a nice day.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That would be nice however reality is far from what you have said. Trump has not made us stronger he has made us weaker. Remember the g20? Trump had to be told 10 times how he couldnt just make a deal directly with germany and had to be taught by Angel Merkel how trade with the Eu. 
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jul/02/donald-trump-foreign-policy-diplomacy">https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jul/02/donald-trump-foreign-policy-diplomacy</a></p>

<p>Also since he leaked classified information to russia from israel, foreign intellegence services have been picky on what they share with us. </p>

<p>Trumps realtionships with mexico and canada, our 2 trade partners that rank 3rd and 4th in exports have soured as well. Talks of renegotiating nafta or abolishing it all together has worried leaders and governors in america. Texas, california, arizona and new mexico would be devasted if nafta was abolished as well as many other states.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Explain what he has done to be a good prez? His party is turning on him. He has worsened trade  with many countries with his rhetoric.  All the job #s and growth have been steady with that of the previous administration. Now, he wants to bring us into another bs war where the enemy will fight till the end because that&#39;s what they&#39;ve  been brainwashed to do. He is a child born into wealth who can give two fucks about you, I, or anyone not in his world or that circle. </p>

<p>It&#39;s one thing to play the politician game and say one thing behind closed doors, but to do so in public as a representation of 323+ million people is just as dangerous and disrespectful as Kim Jun baby face. We&#39;re all going to loose with this mentality. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We have different political views. I see President Trump as being bold, and strong and not backing down. I think forcing a war on North Korea should&#39;ve been done sooner, rather than later. I believe that balance can be achieved through war and death. Change takes risk. The USA has stepped in and taken control in various situations in the past and we have prevailed. I do not care what other world leaders think, and what other country&#39;s citizens believe about America or Trump. I care about the USA dominating and controlling the world so that my family and friends can live safe and happy and with greater luxury. This country is new and founded on the backs of hardworking men. Everything we have is because we fought for it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel you, I have repeatedly asked for a FACT BASED non hearsay based in reality conversation on wtf you support him. Not one, not ONE answer other than the usual unimaginative &quot;libtard&quot; comment. (I am not even liberal!- Independant at best) But that is the thing, they can&#39;t. Not only that they cannot, as there is NO redeeming factors but their brains are literally wired differently. Harvard did a study (UCLA did as well) and they were able to show, scientifically, that the brains of conservatives are in fact different. When shown conflicting images (ie. pictures of church then a picture of a homeless person) they neurological centers that control sympathy and empathy were non-reactive to the latter. In comparison, Liberal&#39;s were more &quot;balanced&quot; in their &quot;beliefs and acts&quot;. SO I am sure that they will say this is fake news too but as a scientist and neural engineer, for the Government, I believe it. Also, if science is just a bunch of bullshit, don&#39;t take medicine then. Do not go see a doctor-under the AHC you despise so (wait until you don&#39;t have it anymore then we will really see how bad it was) Argh. But what really gets me is these &quot;conservatives&quot; and &quot;christian&quot; people are the 1st to hurl insults and resort to name calling, which I am sure Jesus totally approves of...just sayin..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>100% agree with you. Education, lack of exposure to other cultures and rural environments cater to the conservative way. When people group into high density communities they tend to be more liberal because they understand what is necessary to support a large scale population. Conservatism is not a one size fits all philosophy, government needs to scale to its populations needs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for contributing to the conversation!</p>

<p>Trumps jobs and market numbers are good, and have been on the rise for the last 4 years. Trumps talk of deregulation and tax breaks have given business confidence and has had a positive effect on the markets.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/making-sense/todays-unemployment-number-fools-us-president-trump-different-reasons/">http://www.pbs.org/newshour/making-sense/todays-unemployment-number-fools-us-president-trump-different-reasons/</a></p>

<p>But that is the only effect Trump has had on the market. Trump has not passed a budget or a tax plan, it is uncertain exactly his plans are and the effect on the markets they will have. One thing is certain and that is Trump was elected during a time of growth, the markets have been trending upwards since 2009 and unemployment has fallen to its lowest points before he took office. Most of the growth is inhereted and it is too soon to tell the effect that trump will have on the markets and unemployment.</p>
