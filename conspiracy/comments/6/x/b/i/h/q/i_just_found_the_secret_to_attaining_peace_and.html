It was basically just a horrible waste of time and energy being active on any political subreddit. Reddit is and likely always will be controlled by the establishment. My views on freedom will never be allowed to look good on their own turf. They know that, and gain much from it. They want us to bicker and complain on here so that it feels like we&#39;re making a difference, when we really aren&#39;t. The only way for people to actually hear me, and anyone free-minded, is by going outside talking to anyone who&#39;ll listen. That&#39;s what they don&#39;t want us to do, they want us to sit idly in front of our screens and trick us into thinking we&#39;re accomplishing something, when all we&#39;re doing is trying to beat them at their own game. Quit wasting time on here with endless political debate and make your time on the internet something to enjoy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So how can I talk to open minded people when they have been programmed to believe the fiction of a reality they live in. I once was explaining pizzagate to one of my friends and they were literally filling in pieces of information that I didn&#39;t even know about that proves how real pizzagate was and then didn&#39;t believe it&#39;s real. </p>

<p>I didn&#39;t think massive mind/thought control was a thing until I discovered people straight up denying the truth. It&#39;s very frustrating but getting fustrated does nothing but make it harder to change the world. Good thing Reddit still has a hint of some free speech in subs like this... even though it&#39;s compromised.</p>
