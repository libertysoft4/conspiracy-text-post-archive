<li>Intro</li>
</ul>

<p>First off, I&#39;m a 9th grade drop out, so please expect some bad grammar/spelling here and there. This is a very long post, and if you aren&#39;t absolutely dying to have a better understanding of life&#39;s greatest mysteries, and perhaps even you&#39;d rather not know, just move on.</p>

<p>I researched conspiracy theories for 8 years to get here. I did that long enough to be utterly certain one of three things were happening: 1. these events were taking place, 2. someone wanted us to believe they were taking place. 3. Both 1 and 2. So I stopped researching them, and began looking for clues as to why they&#39;d want us to believe these things. I went back to the JFK &#39;The President and the Press&#39; speech, and in that speech, I just couldn&#39;t help but notice all the emphasis he was placing on Karl Marx, and secret societies. He even closes the speech with Francis Bacon! To me, and especially if listened to (the audio), it sounds as if he is addressing his own cult members. They laugh nervously, and at the wrong points to things which aren&#39;t even funny without some sort of insider jokes/knowledge, and get dead silent as he moves into secret societies.</p>

<p>This really piqued my interests, and for a time I investigated Marx, The Frankfurt School, communism and socialism. This led me to Critical Theory, Critical Pedagogy, and Radical Critical Pedagogy. These are negative social sciences. I mean quite literally negative- to sum them up, they all advocate engineered suffering. I couldn&#39;t believe what I was reading, and so I bounced from one research paper to another, and another, for a few days. There was dozens of them from all of the most respected educational institutions and think tanks in the country, and from around the world. I had finally discovered the <em>language</em> I was always looking for, but was too busy picking cherries to ever begin working my way down to the roots, and that&#39;s why cherries are there. From here, I began looking for the justifications for the negative social sciences, and I found them in abundance in continental philosophy.</p>

<p>It&#39;s one of the two main schools of thought in philosophy- continental and analytic. Analytic philosophy is like a Japanese sedan- kind of boring, but very reliable so long as you stay on the roads. Continental philosophy is like a 4 wheel drive jeep- it can take you anywhere. At first it appeared to have a crippling fascination with death, decay, entropy, descent, etc, but I ultimately discovered it&#39;s all to facilitate a more complete, <em>quickened</em> rebirth. But I still couldn&#39;t understand why we didn&#39;t use analytic philosophy- it seemed so much more <em>predictable</em> than continental philosophy. So I went searching for its justifications. Where else could I go at this point?</p>

<p>There&#39;s only one place for a westerner <em>left</em>- the Bible. </p>

<ul>
<li>Begin &#39;<em>Dan will be a snake by the roadside, a viper along the path, that bites the horse&#39;s heels so that its rider tumbles backward.&#39;</em></li>
</ul>

<p>I think I have decoded a small portion of the Bible. Well, the important parts anyhow.</p>

<p>We do not have the right to condemn anyone but ourselves- this is its biggest truth.</p>

<p>Egypt (the pyramids) was built solely to tell this story: it was built for no other purpose. It is the center of the material world. Anyway:</p>

<p>It&#39;s about false dichotomies- rich/poor, black/white, government/people, law/chaos, man/woman, etc- it simply aims to teach us life/universe is far more complicated than this, and it is telling <em>our</em> story. It&#39;s the story of the <em>creation</em> of (the words and the ideas they give birth to)&quot;good&quot; and &quot;evil&quot;, <strong>left and right</strong>, chaos and order, and how they came into existence, and how the waters (the people, the fish, mans consciousness) were split in half- Cain and Abel, or Ephraim and Manasseh. More than this, however, it is the story of how man, and wo-man were separated from one another through the externalization of our own qualities (beauty, intelligence, righteousness, love, etc), onto everything but us, and what we had to undertake, and are still undertaking in order to get them back. It is the story of the power of (blinding) sight, language, art, music, poetry, symbols, and that which we experience, and its impact on our psyche (spirit). It&#39;s the story of mans consciousness, and how our thoughts alone make reality what it is.</p>

<p>Imagine the <a href="https://s61.podbean.com/pb/fc23f3e3690f5df7a092c3ef8dab9122/59a648c1/data2/fs152/608097/uploads/06-14_-_Eyes_Wide_Open.jpg"><em>eyes wide open</em></a> - or <em>eyes wide shut</em></p>

<p><a href="http://finalprodigy.com/wp-content/gallery/human-ear/earsketch03.jpg">Human left ear:</a> (notice the G in the center? when it&#39;s reversed it becomes a D) - it&#39;s actually a C, but we&#39;ll get to that.</p>

<p>The Face of God is mans face, minus his left hemisphere, I&#39;ll explain. If you look at a human head, his left ear is a G, left eye= O, right eye = O, and finally the right ear= D. What&#39;s that spell?</p>

<p>GOOD - This is why the owl is on the dollar bill, and is often depicted in places of power- Shakespeare seems to have known all about it, and Picasso&#39;s works fit the bill as well. Eye&#39;s wide open because our emotional centers are incredibly overdeveloped (actually just crossed)... <a href="https://hilo.hawaii.edu/%7Eart/gallery/g/p/1130291757.png">owl man</a> His necklace represents duality. The light bulb burns bright next to his right hemisphere. He worships false idols and is enveloped in the arts- his eyes are always wide open, even when he&#39;s <em>sleeping</em>.</p>

<p>What&#39;s it spell after we take one of the eyeballs, specifically the left eye, away?</p>

<p>GOD <a href="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/13nL4jJ54yQ/maxresdefault.jpg">Sistine Chapel, Michelangelo, The Creation of Adam (atom/Atum)- God is enveloped in a fleshy cloud shaped like a brain</a> - this is what you&#39;re told when you visit the chapel, it&#39;s a brain.</p>

<p>Why do we take the left eye away? Because it represents the left hemisphere of the brain, the logic center. Our feminine right brain has become the dominant brain for men, while women&#39;s left brain has become the dominate side for them- this is The Cross. It has happened through the drive to acquire material wealth, to compartmentalize information, and the metanarrative of good verses evil, and the creation of the <em>word</em> good. Our *conundrum is represented in two interlocking Fibonacci spirals- one going down (wo-mans), and one going up (mans). We&#39;re apparently almost at the point where they intersect once more, and we can uncross our energy fields. </p>

<p><a href="https://i.pinimg.com/736x/f0/36/a0/f036a02c1f7f9265aa2d7cac4d7a6dac--fibonaccis-spiral-golden-ratio.jpg">It looks something like this:</a> - this is where the heart icon comes from</p>

<p>Basically the Fibonacci or Golden Ratio (in this context) is a theory about an event horizon represented by a time constant, a reality constant, and a third I haven&#39;t figured out yet. I think they intersect next year. <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/52fd5845e4b074ebcf586e7b/t/54208f37e4b0968055cf3236/1411419959963/spiral_dynamics5.jpg">Spiral Dynamics</a></p>

<p>Why is the left ear represented by a G and not a C? <strong>It is a C. It&#39;s a capital C. Turn it upwards in your mind- the left and right columns represent the left and right human visual cortex. The G is the C with a stream of blinding light entering the right eye.</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-DeF7ldSDp5E/T7Zkktj4T1I/AAAAAAAADV8/wgBwaStSykw/s1600/musica-callada_fig4.jpg">Here&#39;s how St John sketched it:</a></p>

<p><a href="http://aotw-pd.s3.amazonaws.com/images/paint-72dpi.jpg">Brain hemispheres.</a>- the right side is bleeding colors</p>

<p>See the Mercedes logo in the bottom right? They know marketing, and they want you to think with your right brain- this is the material brain. This is why we are so materialistic. </p>

<p>This has happened to most religions (if not all, save perhaps some of the hardcore...). They worship good, not god, and good is only as real as we allow evil to be.</p>

<p>Mercy is what we must have, if we choose, not &#39;good&#39;.  </p>

<p>Satan is merely mans ego- the world is not going to end- it&#39;s going to experience a rebirth. <a href="http://www.whale.to/c/isisho3.jpg">ego death or material imprisonment</a></p>

<p>We live in modern day Egypt. It is the continuation of the oldest empire on earth. It has captured mans imagination in a virtual reality prison of materialism. We are witnessing feminine destruction because of the false belief of separation. For example, a cat can only be stealthy, cunning, and independent in your eyes if you remove these qualities from yourself. For some reason- this is a basic universal law which we have broken so many times, we&#39;re on the verge of fixing it. Egyptians domesticated cats for this purpose alone. Egypt is essentially a spell that has been cast on the entire human race, even people who are aware of it are under its influence.</p>

<p>Basically it works like this: if you wish rich people didn&#39;t have so much money <strong>they get even more.</strong></p>

<p>If you wish for less death and misery in the world <strong>it gets even more.</strong></p>

<p>If you deny the wealth of the world <strong>you will have it all.</strong></p>

<p>But you can&#39;t just <em>think</em> these things, you have to <em>know</em> them.</p>

<p>And I don&#39;t mean this in a figurative way. I mean literally. The Rothschild family is the wealthiest family on earth because they have known about this longer than anyone, and have been denying wealth and it&#39;s power over them for a long time. In other words, they&#39;d like nothing more than to be poor and ignorant: <em>you get what you deny.</em></p>

<p>Man and wo-mans energy fields are crossed and I think it is represented in the Bible as the Jordan river. This is why the Jordan river runs red with blood, and why they cross it- women&#39;s energy is represented by red, while mans energy is represented by white- this is where candy canes come from.</p>

<p>Imagine taking a child and raising him from birth, purely on Disney films, until 20 years of age, and then placing him in the world and telling him to get a job.. He wouldn&#39;t be able to cope, he&#39;d be asking for puppies. Now, combine all other movies, media, art, music, comic books, board games, street signs, architecture, video games, labels, logos, clothing, phone apps, events, fashion statements, protests, objects, schooling, language, conflicts, even warning labels, etc- this is aesthetic reality. Aesthetic reality gives you more tools to work with, but you still end up a shell of yourself. It decides how we view the world. Not how the world is. Aesthetic reality is constantly enforcing the metanarrative of good verses evil to take our attention away from the real power centers of our world (the purpose is much greater). Yes, struggle is real, but no one is immune to it, and the belief in good and evil gave us the world we live in. We are living in the Matrix.</p>

<p>We have basically nurtured the world to death. They built the pyramids to show us that we have forgotten more than we&#39;ve ever learned. To show us you can not be a part of the universe if you literally start externalizing it from within, just so you can see it. Apparently there was a time on this planet in which we didn&#39;t live in houses, but we stayed warm dry and comfortable, we didn&#39;t farm food, but we were well fed. A time when the real magic of the universe was at our beckoning anytime we needed it, and just because we wanted to give it a name or write it down, we lost it. </p>

<p>Please use a Bible search engine to search for words like good, burden, jaw, Jesus (the truth <em>and</em> the light), watchers (insider/outsiders), donkey, ass, clouds (shapeless forms that can go anywhere and caste a shade), Cain and Abel, left and right (especially these), turn (another good one), burden, and any other words you can think of that relate to this post. Please post what you find if you find it interesting or in apparent opposition, I welcome both.</p>

<p>I&#39;m still working on all the Egyptian stuff, but it&#39;s where it all started. Imo, it&#39;s where the Bible was conceived of and written. Adam is merely Atum, and I&#39;m still trying to figure out who Eve is, and Horus seems to be modern man. Then there&#39;s other things I don&#39;t even want to think about let alone mention- nothing bad, though.</p>

<p>St John painting of some sort- it&#39;s some sort of convoluted representation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascent_of_Mount_Carmel#/media/File:Hildegard_von_Bingen_Liber_Divinorum_Operum.jpg">man and woman.</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I should have mentioned one of the main things that led me here was a college kids thesis on the JFK assassination. To sum it up, it was one of the most recorded events in history. There was hundreds of witnesses each giving different testimonies. It was an intentional shit show. This led me to believe it was a hoax, so I made my way to the autopsy photos.</p>

<p>I&#39;m a child of the internet- I&#39;ve seen plenty of blown open heads, and that&#39;s not what is depicted in the photos. They look as fraudulent as they could possibly get. His eye&#39;s are even open to different widths in different photos. They did their best to cover the lack of a whole in his head. Go check em out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>“…by the madness which interrupts it, a work of art opens a void, a moment of silence, a question without answer, provokes a breach without reconciliation where the world is forced to question itself. What is necessarily a profanation in the work of art returns to that point, and, in the time of that work swamped in madness, the world is made aware of its guilt. Henceforth, and through the mediation of madness, it is the world that becomes culpable (for the first time in the Western world) in relation to the work of art; it is now arraigned by the work of art, obliged to order itself by its language, compelled by it to a task of recognition, of reparation, to the task of restoring reason from that unreason and to that unreason. The madness in which the work of art is engulfed is the space of our enterprise, it is the endless path to fulfillment, it is our mixed vocation of apostle and exegete. This is why it makes little difference when the first voice of madness insinuated itself into Nietzsche’s pride, into Van Gogh’s humility. There is no madness except as the final instant of the work of art–the work endlessly drives madness to its limits; where there is a work of art, there is no madness; and yet madness is contemporary with the work of art, since it inaugurates the time of its truth. The moment when, together, the work of art and madness are born and fulfilled is the beginning of the time when the world finds itself arraigned by that work of art and responsible before it for what it is.
“Ruse and new triumph of madness: the world that thought to measure and justify madness through psychology must justify itself before madness, since in its struggles and agonies it measures itself by the excess of works like those of Nietzsche, of Van Gogh, of Artaud. And nothing in itself, especially not what it can know of madness, assures the world that it is justified by such works of madness.”–Madness and Civilization, Michel Foucault</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey OP, you speak of some interesting points (incl. stuff I didn&#39;t know about) but I think there&#39;s a few inaccuracies.</p>

<p>Apologies if I misinterpret your post but socialism and left/right in politics has absolutely nothing to do with the left/right brain hemisphere.
Left/right wing were coined in the French Revolution where left wing = sitting to the left of the king because you were on the side of the people (revolution).
Right wing = sitting on the right of the king as you were on his side (pro-status quo). It was violent and probably controlled but that&#39;s how they were coined.
Anti-establishment revolutions should be peaceful.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know much about Marx but I&#39;m not a Marxist anyway, there&#39;s non-marxist types of socialism such as democratic socialism and social democracy mixed economics. Jesus himself was a democratic (i.e. non dictator) socialist hence him
teaching us to help the poor.....something the establishment false Christian politicians don&#39;t respect.
Many American Christians would disappoint Jesus as politicians with their talking points
have brainwashed people into thinking right wing = Christian, when the exact opposite is true.</p>

<p>You can&#39;t help the poor when you keep supporting the corporations (DNC/GOP both do this, they&#39;re both on the same team,
there is no mainstream left or centrist, Bernie was an outsider that got rigged against.)
Other democratic socialists include Nikola Tesla, Albert Einstein, George Orwell, that Christian baptist preacher
who wrote the U.S. pledge of allegience, Gandhi, Charlie Chaplin, etc.</p>

<p>One of Gandhi&#39;s quotes was &quot;I like your Christ, I do not like your Christians. Your Christians are unlike your Christ&quot;.
He&#39;s referring to misguided Christians who follow the right wing indoctrination that is incompatible with true Christianity.
There can be a balance of course, but these people tend to vote for extremists like Ted Cruz and such
because they&#39;re brainwashed by their talking points. Religion shouldn&#39;t even be involved in politics anyway.</p>

<p>On the topic of communism: The USSR/Mao/North Korea (false communist) are state capitalist extreme authoritarian police spy state dictatorships,
totally different to anarcho-communism (real communism) which is a moneyless, stateless society.
In state capitalism, beurocrats controlled the means of production, even profitted from it, and seized small businesses that got arbitrarily too big (probably hence Ayn Rand turning into a far right libertarian sociopath since apparently she loathed leftism because of what the state capitalist USSR did, they seized her father&#39;s business twice I think, she falsely thought it was robbery against the rich to feed the poor....but it was just the super rich
robbing from everyone else, like other establishment politics).</p>

<p>But the USSR doesn&#39;t represent true leftism IMO since it was state capitalistic and beurocratic.
So Ayn Rand was hating one establishment concept (state capitalism)
and promoting another establishment concept (far right libertarianism). Jumping from one extreme to another extreme.
Both are cruel against the people, as is normal fascism. All three are fascist(ic) in nature
as one/few groups (ruling class/beurocrats/money creators) of people impose their will on the majority (e.g. corporations dictate the market with far right libertarianism due
to no regulations).</p>

<p>Anyway, it&#39;s interesting that there&#39;s a spelling similary with GOD/ GOOD and DEVIL/ EVIL.
Not sure if it&#39;s a coincidence or a trivial reason or something deeper.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t really inderstand the duality thing and yin/yang, etc.
Some of the stuff you wrote went over my head and I&#39;m not sure
how much is coincidence/confirmation bias but have you heard of Santos Bonacci?
He spoke about the &quot;left hand path&quot; being the evil one (I think
the etymology of this word is related to the Latin for sinister OR germanic for weaker side of the body, probably due
to the heart being on that side....not sure).</p>

<p>Anyway, have you heard of the Christos oil?
Here&#39;s my thread on it, (Santos Bonacci also speaks of it)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>BTW, you said if you want to be rich,
then think of being poor (opposites) or something like that?
Doesn&#39;t that go completely against the idea of the Law of Attraction and cause &amp; effect (karma)?
Not talking about karmic debt though, as I think that concept
is false because it seems to come from the idea that we are beings on Earth who are meant to &quot;learn&quot; something and remove their karmic debt but it just seems like an archon type trick (if you entertain these gnostic type concepts)
to trick you into recycling your soul/life force energy and reincarnate.
What are your thoughts on this?
Anyway, it personally doesn&#39;t make sense to me that
if you think about being poor, you&#39;ll be rich,
because I don&#39;t think the elite really think about that.
I think they&#39;re just greedy and psychopathic (the cause of their evil)
and has evolved into obsession with power/slavery hence the NWO global fascist dictatorship conspiracy they&#39;re trying to push.
IMO these elites are just mentally ill and scummy.
Either that or Satan/archons/demiruge/demons really do exist lol.
On the other hand, the elites might be using satan as an excuse &quot;SATAN MADE ME DO IT&quot; lol.
But anyway, these secret societies were inspired by Babylonian/ancient Egyptian cults I think.
Is it a coincidence also that Bible sounds like Babylon??
I haven&#39;t done much research into the mystery school stuff yet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think such things were designed to bring trouble into our lives. We learn far more from negativity than we learn from anything else life has to offer. There is no such thing as positive energy- only neutral. Love is most certainly real, but it is only love for thyself. There is no other.</p>

<p>&quot;Not talking about karmic debt though, as I think that concept is false because it seems to come from the idea that we are beings on Earth who are meant to &quot;learn&quot; something and remove their karmic debt but it just seems like an archon type trick (if you entertain these gnostic type concepts) to trick you into recycling your soul/life force energy and reincarnate. What are your thoughts on this?&quot;</p>

<p>Yes, I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any debts either. I would have to agree with you. Imo, I think most spiritual movements and religions are focusing on the wrong things. I believe that all things are possible merely through loving yourself. You can not love other people without losing love for ones self- this is because we are all extensions of one another. It seems to be a dangerous externalization.</p>

Stuff like we are all from one consciousness?

I don&#39;t understand that saying.</p>

<p>And maybe instead of &quot;think the opposite and you&#39;ll get it&quot;
perhaps you really meant &quot;be grateful and say you love yourself and deserve more wealth&quot; ?
It sounds counter productive to go against the law of attraction and actually think about things you don&#39;t want lol. Just saying.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Bible, my friend, is a faith destroying (and rebuilding) paradox to get us to experience a quickened spiritual evolution. Millions of people around the world realize this, and are doing everything in their power to speed us along. W&#39;ere going out the back door to go through the front. I know this might not make much sense, but it&#39;s the way it is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re welcome to your own views, my friend.
But I just want you to know that I&#39;m not entirely convinced with <strong>some</strong>
of the concepts you bring up such as the idea of the Law of attraction IN REVERSE O_o 
(especially as you say it&#39;s impossible to encourage the universe to improve your wealth, yet you suggest
thinking the opposite will get what you want....not calling you dishonest, but this inconsistency suggests rather that perhaps you made an error somewhere? I do entertain the idea that the universe is part of consciousness and that you CAN affect it with
with your thoughts and meditation but that&#39;s just my entertaining view.)</p>

<p>and the idea that the elites are not really evil (I think they objectively are, since they have some free will despite their mental illness, ignorance, etc. Almost everyone has a choice to do the right thing, they could have gotten a psychiatrist with their unlimited money)</p>

<p>I&#39;m not undermining ALL of your research presented here, because some
of it seems very interesting (I still need to get my head around the Horus eye thing and &quot;we&#39;re all one&quot; thing)
as well as the concept of &quot;combining both hemispheres making you get closer to enlightenment&quot; which actually seems
consistent with my own research (the Christos oil thing, which I entertain but haven&#39;t fully proved it to myself yet).
But either way, scientifically, there are benefits to improving the utilization of both hemispheres, I just haven&#39;t proven it to myself that it speeds up the journey to enlightenment.</p>

<p>I&#39;m just letting you know my disagreement to some of the concepts so you know
there&#39;s a possibility that they&#39;re incorrect, and therefore, you can research it again and maybe
find out if there was an error in your reading or source, etc.
Just constructive criticism, not trying to get you down or anything.</p>

<p>Again, I appreciate your thread, I tried to read all of it (despite having a fairly short attention span,
maybe it was the formatting that made it a bit difficult to read, I&#39;m not sure)
and do think you raised some some interesting points.
If you can convince me otherwise, I&#39;m all ears, but
if not, it&#39;s fine. We&#39;re all learning and trying to get to the truth. :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you want wealth- the universe is going to devise a plan so that you can learn that it&#39;s the last thing we need. That plan could be different for different people. It&#39;s not always going to be the opposite- sometimes the universe may give you what you ask for so that it can take it from you a short time later. Nothing is set in stone.</p>

<p>Nothing is more flexible than mans consciousness.</p>

<p>&quot; yet you suggest thinking the opposite will get what you want..&quot;</p>

<ul>
<li>Thinking and knowing are two different things. No, simply <em>thinking</em> the opposite probably won&#39;t achieve anything, but knowing it will. Few peoples minds are this powerful. The universe gives you what you need, not what you want, and if it&#39;s material things you desire, the universe will give you wisdom instead.</li>
</ul>

<p>&quot;and the idea that the elites are not really evil&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Okay, let&#39;s talk about this, please. Why do you think they&#39;re &#39;evil&#39;?</strong></p>

<p>This is all I want to know.</p>

<p>&quot;Do not give yourself to the earthly treasures, where moth and rust corrupt yourself, where thieves break and steal. But gather these treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust prevail, and where thieves do not break nor steal. Because where your treasure is, your heart will be. No one can serve two masters because he will hate one and love the other, then he would deny one prize and the other. You can not serve both God and Mammon .&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The elites constantly hoarde wealth and if your theory is correct,
it would be because they decided they didn&#39;t want more wealth....doesn&#39;t make sense IMO.
The elites haven&#39;t stopped for a second, they keep plotting ways to remove wealth from the people and accumulate it for themselves. They&#39;re in the same mindset as they were when they first hit big scamming the people with the debt based banking system, corporate corruption, etc.</p>

<p>The elite central bankers control most corporations. The &quot;elite&quot; consist of wallstreet, corporations and elite central bankers. These people have bribed/blackmailed politicians and therefore they control them.
Through rigged politics, they have caused virtually all problems on Earth, virtually all sin.
Wars, poverty, homelessness, divide/conquer infighting, physical illness, mental illness (due to toxins, brainwashing sociopath propaganda in movies/TV, drugs, lack of decent affordable healthcare, compromized medical research, etc.) and by extension, poverty and mental illness contribute to higher crime rates. </p>

<p>Everyone loses because of the elites. The world could have been prosperous if they hadn&#39;t imposed their illogical will on others. Their obsession with money goes hand in hand with their obsession with world domination and slavery (hence the NWO conspiracy).
Worker wages are going down worldwide so we&#39;re on the road to that fascism against the people.</p>

<p>If the universe gave people what they needed, the elites would not have fortunes in the billions and trillions. And the poor would not be so unfortunate.
There is no balance, most wealth is accumulated by the parasitic elites.</p>

<p>Worse than being materialistic is being parasitic and wanting
humans to serve you as slaves.
Nearly all evil comes from politics which the elites have poisoned for a long time.
There&#39;s an unfathomable amount of injustice in the world.
Savages have ruined things for a long time. By now humanity
should have become more civilized but the elites bring us down closer to their level.</p>

<p>Anyway I think the Bible quote is really just saying
don&#39;t be greedy. But the elites are beyond that.
Most people just want to have comfortable lives
but the elites have deprived the people of happiness
for no logical reason.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a crazy theory that it&#39;s easier for the world
to be evil and bring Jesus faster that way, but
that&#39;s nonsense because it&#39;s really not that difficult to
make the population ethical in our modern times
but those in charge pulling the puppet strings, have polluted everything from
the music industry, hollywood/TV, media, education system, smuggling
drugs into neighborhoods, the &quot;war on drugs&quot; incarceration scam, etc.</p>

<p>Our taxes are used more for corporate profit than
to better the population. This is a deliberate behavior.
Plus, so much horrendous evil has existed,
why did Jesus or God not intervene in the countless times
that evil and injustice has occured for thousands of years?</p>

<p>Arriving just at the moment the world is in a nuclear war or whatever,
doesn&#39;t seem logical to me so it seems like a foolish theory
(I think it comes from freemasonry crap, not sure, will have to search for it again).
I&#39;m just mentioning the theory in case
you were hinting at it when you spoke
of the Bible speeding things up by making us learn from evil.</p>

<p>IMO learning has nothing do with it. That fits more with
the new age stuff that claims life is a school (nonsense, if reincarnation is real,
why do our memories get erased, not much learning is it? Sounds like a mindless video game of pain and suffering.)
Once someone is very ethical already (with a kind heart), they&#39;re still
not necessarily enlightened or saved by Jesus or God.
So I&#39;m not understanding your point properly.</p>

<p>What do you mean by the Bible speeding things up?</p>

We are purified by evil; let us sin then to the utmost so as to destroy it by subjecting it to the tortures which will nevertheless afford us some pleasure, and this will be part of askesis!&quot; (Denis de Rougemont, ‘Love in the Western World’)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I first realized this just a few days ago while walking in the woods with my younger brother who is obsessed with rattle snakes. I didn&#39;t want to go, but I didn&#39;t realize why until we went. We were walking down a path, and though there was many things to see and take in, my thoughts were internal. I was thinking about beauty, and how and why we are always searching for it.</p>

<p>It then occurred to me through a flood a feelings that beauty is entirely in the eye of the beholder, and the beholder has lost it. Lately I&#39;ve been discovering that truth is something you feel, not something you think, and I could feel the truth of what was being revealed to me. At this very moment, my eyes locked onto a rock with a fungus growth on it that looked exactly like an owl. I mean, exactly- eyes well defined with circles in circles, shape of the head, perfect. Just 7 days ago I would have kept it- I through it into the woods, and that&#39;s when I realized why I was here, and I must say, it was almost crushing. I have always been a child of the forest, it&#39;s always been my real home.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if you know about the Tuatha De Danann, but they were an ancient people of Ireland. I tried to imagine a real Garden of Eden- little naked people, joyous, well fed, but without ever having to work for it. I imagined what would happen if suddenly the Mona Lisa appeared in their world. I think it&#39;s pretty obvious it would destroy them, as it would force them to analyze themselves in ways that only their fleeting reflections in pools of water had done previously, but with much more power. Makes you wonder if all those ancient cave paintings were Eve&#39;s.</p>

<p>This brings to mind the somewhat of icons and iconography and ultimately the seminal ancient thinker on the subject, Plato. To wit, some observations I have previously made on the subject, with an appended excerpt from Plato.</p>

<p>&quot;Historical iconoclasm is actually a wondrous thing, highly advanced, anticipating by millennia the universe of problems associated with present-day, technologically mediated, iconophilia, including the transcendent, generation-defining problem of Internet pornography and related dynamic image-induced mesmerizations, where the possessed image ends up gradually possessing the unguarded possessor and entrapping him/her in the “prison house” whose very walls are the projections of unguarded sight. The phantasmata channeled by the fathomless ‘mirror’, volatilized and dynamized by an incomprehensible and untrustworthy demiurge, are anticipated by the hyper-real “demon-possessed” anthropomorphic statues of antiquity, not to mention the actually existing automata of that age: combining the dual extraneous potential (i.e. enchantments) of representation-enhancing technologies and the primitive, unreflective, libidinal human urge. As Plato wrote: “This entire allegory, I said, you may now append, dear Glaucon, to the previous argument; the prison-house is the world of sight, the light of the fire is the sun, and you will not misapprehend me if you interpret the journey upwards to be the ascent of the soul into the intellectual world according to my poor belief, which, at your desire, I have expressed whether rightly or wrongly God knows. But, whether true or false, my opinion is that in the world of knowledge the idea of good appears last of all, and is seen only with an effort; and, when seen, is also inferred to be the universal author of all things beautiful and right, parent of light and of the lord of light in this visible world, and the immediate source of reason and truth in the intellectual; and that this is the power upon which he who would act rationally, either in public or private life must have his eye fixed.</p>

<p>I agree, he said, as far as I am able to understand you.
Moreover, I said, you must not wonder that those who attain to this beatific vision are unwilling to descend to human affairs; for their souls are ever hastening into the upper world where they desire to dwell; which desire of theirs is very natural, if our allegory may be trusted.</p>

<p>Yes, very natural.
And is there anything surprising in one who passes from divine contemplations to the evil state of man, misbehaving himself in a ridiculous manner; if, while his eyes are blinking and before he has become accustomed to the surrounding darkness, he is compelled to fight in courts of law, or in other places, about the images or the shadows of images of justice, and is endeavouring to meet the conceptions of those who have never yet seen absolute justice?</p>

<p>Anything but surprising, he replied.
Any one who has common sense will remember that the bewilderments of the eyes are of two kinds, and arise from two causes, either from coming out of the light or from going into the light, which is true of the mind’s eye, quite as much as of the bodily eye; and he who remembers this when he sees any one whose vision is perplexed and weak, will not be too ready to laugh; he will first ask whether that soul of man has come out of the brighter light, and is unable to see because unaccustomed to the dark, or having turned from darkness to the day is dazzled by excess of light. And he will count the one happy in his condition and state of being, and he will pity the other; or, if he have a mind to laugh at the soul which comes from below into the light, there will be more reason in this than in the laugh which greets him who returns from above out of the light into the den.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it all started with mirrors, liquid and illiquid reflective surfaces, it inserted into man&#39;s mind in the most immediately impressive way possible the brute notion of infinity, and the association of the latter with the image, especially the image of the human face and body: the dual reflection of an infinite insubstantial interiority that complements the seemingly infinite exteriority of the physico-spatial world, the stars, blades of grass, insects, particulates of water...down to the invisible speculative atoms that may reconcile the invisibility of inner psychological volitional life with the world of externally-directed sensory access and contact, conflict and menace, but also temptation for dominance and control. The two are ultimately one, but this understanding requires an arduous process of apprehension, from the perspective of primitively temperamented-mind. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&#39;[Samson] thus preserves and renews his elect status as “separate to God” and God&#39;s nursling. Samson&#39;s contradictory act of transgression and obedience reflects his new understanding of the equation between God&#39;s enforcement and suspension of the law, which aligns highest justice with true liberty. If it leads him away from the maternal-centered home and the old, embodied, or carnal Israel, Samson&#39;s reversal from no to yes shows him the way back home in its new de-familiarized worldwide form. Obedience and transgression, separateness and mixture, national and international, provide the mutually constitutive measures of Samson&#39;s reformed identity and spiritual freedom.&quot;</p>

<p>I think insects, like all things, reflect back on a perceiving subject a re-concentrated intentionality, to wit, insects are ambulatory mirrors, composed quite literally of reflective surfaces, compound eyes, wings, quite often metallic-seeming carapaces, they contain the mystery of mechanistic automaticity (even roboticity) avant la lettre. However, they are also incarnate guideposts towards an ultimate teleology of sentient robot/artificially intelligent life.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Aristotle considered insects &quot;bloodless,&quot; and described them typically thus: &quot;The anterior legs [of insects] are in some cases longer than the others, that they may serve to wipe away any foreign matter that may lodge on the insect’s eyes and obstruct its sight, which already is not very distinct owing to the eyes being made of a hard substance. Flies and bees and the like may be constantly seen thus dressing themselves with crossed forelegs. Of the other legs, the hinder are bigger than the middle pair, both to aid in running and also that the insect, when it takes flight, may spring more easily from the ground. This difference is still more marked in such insects as leap, in locusts for instance, and in the various kinds of fleas. For these first bend and then extend the legs, and, by doing so, are necessarily shot up from the ground. It is only the. hind legs of locusts, and not the front ones, that resemble the steering oars of a ship. For this requires that the joint shall be deflected inwards, and such is never the case with the anterior limbs. The whole number of legs, including those used in leaping, is six in all these insects.&quot;</p>

<p>To wit, like instruments or the &quot;jointed&quot; and rigidly manufactured parts of artificial instruments and machines, they were literally &quot;bloodless&quot; automata to him, . </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The universe is the reflection of a mirror
—Śrī Ādi Śaṅkarācārya</p>

<p>Not-Being is the mirror of Absolute Being,
Whence is apparent the reflection of God&#39;s splendour.
When Not-Being became opposed to Being
A reflection thereof was at once produced.
—Sheikh Mahmoud Shabestari</p>

<p>Not-Being is the Mirror; the universe is the reflection; and man
is the Personality concealed in it, like the eye in the reflection.
—Sheikh Mahmoud Shabestari</p>

<p>Substance is in itself or implicitly Subject, all content is its own reflection into itself. The subsistence or substance of anything that exists is its self-identity; for a failure of self-identity would be its dissolution. Self-identity, however, is pure abstraction; but this is thinking.
—Hegel</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also the artists are all luciferians. They have sold their soul.</p>

<p>The reason the bible says don&#39;t be gay or don&#39;t sodomize (anal play) is because if you do so there are nerves in your anus  (root chakra) that connects to your brain (third eye/pineal/thalamus etc) that makes it EASIER to mind control people. Discovered this when I found out the elite were all luciferians and they sodomize children and sacrifice them as well as sodomize every celeb that they promote. </p>

<p>Remember forces of evil and good can occupy your body. Learn about the right hand and cleanse yourself before you seek enlightenment or otherworldly help because if you don&#39;t do the cleansing you will be deceived (the common denominator among the religions they all say that in their final steps the devil would show them their greatest desires and lie)</p>

<p>Good post otherwise. Reminds me of when  I followed conspiracy theories and was stuck in the illusion of being focused too much on that stuff. You should turn your eyes inward.</p>

But the fact of the matter is your true soul knows the truth. When I fell for it I would go into huge rages when other ppl &quot;just didn&#39;t get it and why should I be enlightened when sheep don&#39;t care&quot;.</p>

<p>Demonic, if you ever searched for the underlying causes of your anger.</p>

<p>Ego death is amazing because I grow everytime I kill part of it. I grow and fall in love with life and everything. When someone tells me to quit smoking I can see past my ego of needing to be self sufficient enough to do so but at the same time wallow in my inherent disability to do so and instead of angrily reacting to my FRIEND WHO IS ONLY CARING ABOUT MY HEALTH.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s basically the story of my life- I&#39;m 39. I was both one of the brightest and one of the worst behaving kids you can imagine. I loved and hated my teachers all at once. They didn&#39;t know whether to move me to the front of the classroom, or kick me out of school altogether. I still remember my first day of kindergarten.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t want to go- I was very angry at my mother for making me, and when I got there, I laid on the floor and kicked my legs so as to spin in circles. Eventually I calmed down, and when I did- I simply left the building. 6 years old, going right out the front door- it was nearly the end of the day (yes, I was upset that long), and a crossing guard caught and returned me. I didn&#39;t listen to anyone. I was the kind of kid who would deny his own biological functions if possible.</p>

<p>Oppositional to a fault. So this was the story of my life- getting suspended, expelled, etc. I was a behavioral problem of the worst kind. I&#39;ve cussed out more teachers than I can even remember. I&#39;ve torn the top off of one of my school desks and then bent the support arms around one another, picked it up, and threw it (maybe 12 yr&#39;s). I hung out the window of the third story of an elementary school at the mid point of telling one of my teachers I was &quot;Mike Tyson&quot; and I would &quot;knock him out&quot; (like 1988). I hated school, and I did everything in my power not to go.</p>

<p>Usually this entailed feigning sickness. Anyhow- this eventually landed my in juvenile detention. I discovered cannabis around this time, and it became the focus of my life until I turned 18 and discovered LSD. I hung out with like minded &#39;kids&#39;, and I did this until I turned 25, met a stripper, and ended up addicted to heroin. I did that for ten years bouncing in and out of jail and prison serving almost 6 years when it was all said and done. I got out in 2009, and I&#39;ve simply been researching conspiracy theories and consuming anything of educational value every minute of the day since then (if not working). I don&#39;t watch television. I don&#39;t read fiction. If it isn&#39;t educational, it goes in one ear and out the other. I am absolutely obsessed with information and more importantly living a truthful existence. Everything I&#39;ve done has led me to this point. I believe that the Bible was created so that an uneducated &#39;idiot&#39; like myself would be the only type of person to decode it. It&#39;s the education paradox.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been thinking about this a lot lately. The bible feeds us a &quot;savior&quot; narrative IE: Jesus came to save us all, but the bible simultaneously says that we are all made in God&#39;s image. To me, this seems like a contradiction because if we were all made in HIS image don&#39;t we then have the power to save ourselves? Has this &quot;savior&quot; narrative been fed to us in order to propagate a sense of helplessness? So instead of actively fighting injustice/evil, we await our savior&#39;s to return to redeem us? Perhaps salvation lies in our ability to access the divinity within ourselves? I grew up in the church, so just typing this out seems blasphemous. Perhaps the savior/hero we&#39;ve all been waiting to meet is the savior/hero within ourselves...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that&#39;s a good point- you see, we are spiritual beings of unlimited potential trying to come to grips with losing all of our powers and our ability to <em>see</em> great distances. We find everything limiting, oppressive, and wrong, and that&#39;s likely why we were put here. However, I don&#39;t believe for one minute we were put here to transcend our physical existence.

    <div class="md"><p>So I went down the same path as you somewhat and started to listen t my intuiton even more than I already do. And to never scoff myself off no matter how crazy it got
 Then I started seeing synch like crazy. Always 333 or some variation or 999 and 777 but mainly 333. I started noticing I would get 666 whenever I start thinking wrong or going the wrong way so to speak. So as I was getting frustrated my sister sent me this test and I took it. Got the results and now I am open to all
 Except the lies.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been experiencing synchronicity in other ways. I&#39;ll share one: </p>

<p>I first realized this just a few days ago while walking in the woods with my younger brother who is obsessed with rattle snakes. I didn&#39;t want to go, but I didn&#39;t realize why until we went. We were walking down a path, and though there was many things to see and take in, my thoughts were internal. I was thinking about beauty, and how and why we are always searching for it.</p>

<p>It then occurred to me through a flood a feelings that beauty is entirely in the eye of the beholder, and the beholder has lost it. Lately I&#39;ve been discovering that truth is something you feel, not something you think, and I could feel the truth of what was being revealed to me. At this very moment, my eyes locked onto a rock with a fungus growth on it that looked exactly like an owl. I mean, exactly- eyes well defined with circles in circles, shape of the head, perfect. Just 7 days ago I would have kept it- I threw it into the woods, and that&#39;s when I realized why I was here, and I must say, it was almost crushing. I have always been a child of the forest, it&#39;s always been my real home. I understood then that we were put here to make peace with nature, and that the world was being ruled by destructive (feminine) energy, instead of a perfect balance of the two.</p>

<p>In other words, there&#39;s far too many empty gestures, and they have to be accounted for. That owl was there to confirm to me this was a truth that I had long been searching for. We are essentially imprisoned by mother nature- we need to be <em>in</em> the world and not <em>of</em> it. We have essentially externalized love, and have therefore lost it for ourselves. Same with beauty, it&#39;s is everywhere but within. We are simply coming to a place in which we realize beauty ins&#39;t real.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, the homosexual agenda. I&#39;m pretty sure homosexuality is one of the ways in which the elite like to wallow in their own cognitive dissonance. They think you have to fuck each other in the ass to achieve spiritual enlightenment. Thank <em>god</em> all I had to do was sit on my ass.</p>

<p>No disrespect to anyone. I just don&#39;t agree with the whole gay thing. I think it&#39;s a result of having mans energy fields crossed. Even our testosterone levels are way down as opposed to 100 years ago. Men are far less manly than they&#39;ve ever been.</p>

<p>I missed the Mason hand signal, but I&#39;ll keep an <em>eye</em> out for it the next time I watch it, because I&#39;ll be watching it over and over again.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes as well as the indigo children with the black eyes.</p>

<p>There are nerve endings in your anus that if you stimulate will do things to your pineal gland making it easier to mind control. The pizza gate stuff revealed this. So the gay stuff is satan Saturn worship as well as left hand Magick. Could also be viewed as a shortcut but you can never get real power supposedly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So I&#39;ve finished the movie and hopped on my laptop to type this.</p>

<p>Reincarnation is very real... I already believe in it. Thoth is said to have reincarnated twice and reached enlightenment all 3 times. Thus his third incarnation was as Hermes Trismegistus or &quot;thrice great&quot;. The wiki doesn&#39;t support this theory but this is very known in the occult world.</p>

<p>They show a lot of truth but also lies. This is pushing a gay agenda (maybe the director had to agree to put it in to get funded but the bias is clear).</p>

<p>But yes, you reincarnate to build up your karma. Jesus hints to the fact that he may have been John the Baptist reincarnated. As the more karma you gain the better your chances in your next life. Remember the intermediate stage? It&#39;s real.</p>

<p>Everything I have been saying is true. This movie just cements my belief. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, the thing about all the gay stuff has to do with their belief that the Bible is a paradox. In other words, there&#39;s no fire and brimstone for sinning- and the idea is just a human construct. I just don&#39;t think it&#39;s necessary, but again, I haven&#39;t been through whatever kind of weird initiation ceremony they&#39;ve gone through.</p>

<p>I&#39;m certain they have a video for debriefing people that leaves them floored. Something like a video of JFK and Marilyn Monroe hanging out in Antarctica with Elvis and Kurt Cobain well into their old age, with some sort of spiel about how everything is fake, and carefully crafted to guide mans spiritual destiny. Whatever it is, it easily convinced everyone sufficiently enough to not talk about it but in riddles. Every movie I watch now is talking about it in one way or another.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To get as many of us to deny G-d/Jesus as possible. All signs lead there. ALL. </p>

<p>Making us believe in the globe? A theory pushed by the satanic vatican church and the jesuit trained copernicus? Do you even know the jesuits? Einstein was one. hes a hack too.</p>

<p>P1zazgate is real. There are corporations that do human trafficking. Dync0rp for one. This is all public knowledge. The clinton foundation caught kidnapping kids in haiti. etcetc.</p>

<p>So your goal is to. Cleanse yourself, open your chakras, drink from the living waters and live forever. But mine is to meet G-d and get the truth.</p>

<p>If you watched that video I showed you, you will see video proof of ancient chinese neikung or internal energy. Chi projection etcetc.</p>

<p>In the magus of java the master says if you meditate and fill up your &quot;dantien&quot; then you reach level 1. once you reach level 4 which is to combine your yin and yang energy but this also allows you to keep your memory and become a ghost lets say. Like obi won kenobi. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Remember, satan is the father of lies. If you study the Talmudist jews/khazars you will become REALLLY good at picking out lies and controlled opposition as they gloat about it in their writings throughout history. If they get you to believe anything one level below the truth (prisca theologia) then you fail. Simple as that.</p>

<p>For example. controlled opposition. Bill hicks is Alex jones post plastic surgery. Joe Rogan, Neil de grasse tyson, Trump all pieces. so once you get here you start to realize that these guys are being used to promote SOME truth and many lies because they want you to stop there.
You&#39;ll also realize you&#39;re better off trusting dead men&#39;s words. Like thoth and trismegistrus. Buddha, Jesus. Etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also, the satellite that they use to beam light into sky? </p>

<p>It was shaped as a pinecone which is symbolic for the pineal gland. You can see it all over the Catholic church as well as their papal staff.</p>

<p>So like I said. You open up the chakras (7 lights) and you raise your QRSTU (christ) oil up your 33 vertabrae (jesus&#39;s age when he died. also very very important in numerology, masons have 33 degrees, there are 33 degrees in the un map etcetc sacred geometry).</p>

<p>Once your Christ oil (which is semen for men and unknown for women) raises up to the top of your spine. You complete the electric circuit in your spine by performing the kuchari mudra which is to take your tongue above the soft palate and into the nasal cavity to complete the electric circuit. Once this happens your pineal gland starts secreting seratonin and melatonin which is the land of milk and honey. This can only be done by taking your body to the utter depths of true meditation and which is why all the prophets meditate for 40 days and also &quot;die for 3&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;And it’s interesting b/c looking back on my “awakening &amp; learning process” I see that I HAD to have been divinely guided b/c I “randomly” came across the information in almost perfect sequential order. As though God was running a lesson plan and bringing me the perfect info at the perfect time, in the perfect order.&quot;</p>

<p>This is exactly what&#39;s happening to me. I only had my spiritual awakening 2-3 months ago.</p>

<p>I became a vegan because my body reject meat ( I own a meat shop).
So this lead me down the cleansing path.</p>

<p>The reason the bible says don&#39;t be gay or don&#39;t sodomize (anal play) is because if you do so there are nerves in your anus (root chakra) that connects to your brain (third eye/pineal/thalamus etc) that makes it EASIER to mind control people. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You talk about decoding the Bible, then dance right into the Babylonian/Egyptian mystery sector. The &quot;Externalisation of the Hierarchy&quot; by Bailey you&#39;ve linked to and derived some theories from is Luciferian. It is an accurate description about the world we are living in, and makes a convincing case for growth through pain, if you ignore the usurpation of Christ&#39;s place at the head of the Body.  But it isn&#39;t &quot;Christ like&quot; whatsoever. Mystery Babylon is defeated at the end of the Bible, remember?<br/>
Lucifer is the illuminator, light bringer, serpent, dragon, usurper of the throne, god of the mysteries. Yes, his hierarchy has been at play on humanity, molding the new world order for his beast to take control of. The centralization of every industry, government, health organizations, banks, news, shopping, information, all of this is to usher in his coming to take the seat at the top of the pyramid. He&#39;ll come in the name of peace and bring destruction.  Offer amazing solutions to problems he creates. It is the uniting of mankind under one religion, one government, one body, one mind, with himself as the commander of that body and mind. That has been the objective of these societies from day 1. And it&#39;s nearly complete.
You say the world isn&#39;t going to end, but instead be reborn and I agree with you. Just remember that Lucifer wants himself at the helm of our reborn self, instead of Christ. And when he comes and the whole world marvels at his amazing abilities, don&#39;t fall for the bullocks.</p>

<p>The story you&#39;re telling is just the same old story of good and evil- and evil just isn&#39;t real. </p>

<p>Look, we create our reality through what we believe. That&#39;s all the Bible is attempting to tell us: to make peace with nature so that we can live in it without it possessing us. I mean, did you just ignore all the stuff about right and left brain?</p>

<p>The people who run the world aren&#39;t evil, <strong>they want you to believe they&#39;re evil.</strong> The Bible wants you to create separations from your fellow man through meaningless things like wealth. This is one of it&#39;s tests. Wealthy people are more miserable than you and I. I&#39;d bet on that.</p>

<p>We are all one- we have completely forgotten how to love ourselves, and if you don&#39;t love yourself, you don&#39;t love anyone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are absolutely correct about the &quot;Good and Evil&quot;, only missing the part where Lucifer is playing both sides here on earth. </p>

<p>When eve ate the apple she was given the knowledge of both good and evil. God isn&#39;t &quot;good&quot;, he just IS. What you&#39;re preaching here is attaining godhood through self actualization, the center of the mystery religions, the center of the deception in the garden.</p>

<p>You say &quot;evil&quot; just isn&#39;t real, but it certainly is just as real as &quot;good&quot; in this plane of existence at least. The people who run the world are both good and evil depending on who you ask. And they work tirelessly toward the centralization of all power here on the earthly plane in preparation for their god to arrive and take command.</p>

<p>I agree to an extent that we are all one here. I see the planet as a body and us as its cells. Except, much like cancer, we have been invaded by a disease that we cant seem to detect on our own. Cancer is ignored by the body&#39;s immune system because it sees the harmful cells as one of their own.  The Hierarchy in Baileys books are this cancer, the fallen &quot;angels&quot;, and they&#39;ve infiltrated our body (earth) and are killing it, and creating their own control centers while convincing us it is just &quot;evolution&quot;. </p>

<p>Ever see 2001 a space odyssey? Very esoteric in nature, especially the end. The earth as a womb, humanity the child coming to term. Lot&#39;s of movies have these little hints in them. The Matrix of course, Jupiter rising, there&#39;s tons of stuff like this.</p>

<p>I agree totally about the false left/right dichotomies. These are tools of the Luciferian. Notice in government they pretend to be at odds with each other, but seem to come together regularly in some show of &quot;bipartisan support&quot; whenever they want something detrimental to the common man&#39;s well being pushed through. </p>

<p>There is a war going on and it is spiritual in nature. We are being riled up against one another, taught to hate one another. You keep going on about these &quot;rich people&quot;, what exactly do you consider &quot;rich&quot;? There are only 2 levels in the Luciferian ladder of success. Slaves and the Illuminated &quot;gods.&quot;</p>

<p>You are right that we create the world around us with our thoughts, only missing the part where our thoughts are being manipulated and controlled by those working for the Luciferian hierarchy. This centralization happened before, at the tower of babel. I lean toward the great unfinished pyramid to be the tower of babel.</p>

<p>From the Bible:</p>

<p>&quot; And the LORD said, Behold, the people is one, and they have all one language; and this they begin to do: and now nothing will be restrained from them, which they have IMAGINED to do.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every IMAGINATION of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And the whole earth was of one language, and of one speech&quot; (speech meaning they all thought the same)</p>

<p>Ever since then, these mystery religions are at it again. They want the unification of man as one mind again, a hivemind if you will. </p>

<p>&quot;God&#39;s plan is dedicated to the unification of all races, religions, and creeds. This plan, dedicated to the new order of things, is to make all things new- a new nation, a nonsectarian religion that has already been called the religion of &#39;The Great Light&#39; ... to unfold the New Age of the world- A Novus Ordo Seclorum.&quot;</p>

<p>C. William Smith, the new age magazine, a NWO publication</p>

<p>But God didn&#39;t want that! That was the point of all the diversity in creation. Of the scattering of tongues and thoughts at babel. He didn&#39;t want a bunch of drones who all thought alike. Look at society today. Drones, mostly. People don&#39;t think for themselves, they apply what they hear on the tv or in the newspapers  to themselves and claim it as their own. We&#39;re of one mind and it is racing towards the evils of materialism.</p>

<p>Most wars are fake. Every news story you watch is designed to make you believe in good and evil. There is no good and evil, it&#39;s just another false dichotomy. It&#39;s impossible when you are everything, and everything is you.</p>

<p>Every movies you watch is designed the same way. Who the hell do you think funds these things? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>While I didn&#39;t drop out in 9th grade like you, I have spent the last 10 years or so going down the same rabbit holes, so I&#39;d appreciate it if you didn&#39;t get hostile. We are looking for the same answers, and while you seem to think you have it all figured out, you&#39;re actually falling into the same trap I did. Your last statement there is so full of ego it&#39;s dripping pitch.</p>

<p>Apparently you also don&#39;t understand how top down control via compartmentalization and distraction works, else you wouldn&#39;t consider the feat impossible. The powers (posers) of this worlds hierarchy aren&#39;t physical. They push their influence on men spiritually/emotionally. It&#39;s actually, once a power center is established, quite simple to corrupt and control the entire structure from the top without those that serve understanding the part they are playing.</p>

<p>But I agree that they are shaping reality for us, and we&#39;re letting them so far. Perhaps we can&#39;t stop it, and aren&#39;t supposed to. Without pain perhaps we wouldn&#39;t learn. Satan worked(s?) for God as the tempter, the adversary.</p>

<p>You keep saying there is no &quot;good&quot; and no &quot;evil&quot; and you&#39;re almost right, in the broader sense of reality, before the &quot;apple&quot; Adam and Eve had no clue about them. But God did, and was upset that we chose to put ourselves through this mess. So they do exist, we just don&#39;t need to be subjected to their influences. </p>

<p>You sit here and contradict yourself in as many sentences. You say its no giant conspiracy that it is all impossible, then say this group makes reality and own everything you see and hear and think.... Well, which is it?</p>

<p>And while the education system taught me to read write and math, my spiritual education is self pursued, which is why I&#39;m talking to you now.  </p>

In fact they are far more likely to drop out because they have a far easier time seeing the absolute pointlessness of the rat race to step on your fellow man.

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry I didn&#39;t reply to your ego death part of the question. I fell for the new age stuff too. It sounds grand. But the fact of the matter is your true soul knows the truth. When I fell for it I would go into huge rages when other ppl &quot;just didn&#39;t get it and why should I be enlightened when sheep don&#39;t care&quot;.</p>

<p>Demonic, if you ever searched for the underlying causes of your anger.</p>

<p>Ego death is amazing because I grow everytime I kill part of it. I grow and fall in love with life and everything. When someone tells me to quit smoking I can see past my ego of needing to be self sufficient enough to do so but at the same time wallow in my inherent disability to do so and instead of angrily reacting to my FRIEND WHO IS ONLY CARING ABOUT MY HEALTH.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The elites constantly hoarde wealth and if your theory is correct,
it would be because they decided they didn&#39;t want more wealth....doesn&#39;t make sense IMO.
The elites haven&#39;t stopped for a second, they keep plotting ways to remove wealth from the people and accumulate it for themselves. They&#39;re in the same mindset as they were when they first hit big scamming the people with the debt based banking system, corporate corruption, etc.</p>

<p>The elite central bankers control most corporations. The &quot;elite&quot; consist of wallstreet, corporations and elite central bankers. These people have bribed/blackmailed politicians and therefore they control them.
Through rigged politics, they have caused virtually all problems on Earth, virtually all sin.
Wars, poverty, homelessness, divide/conquer infighting, physical illness, mental illness (due to toxins, brainwashing sociopath propaganda in movies/TV, drugs, lack of decent affordable healthcare, compromized medical research, etc.) and by extension, poverty and mental illness contribute to higher crime rates. </p>

<p>Everyone loses because of the elites. The world could have been prosperous if they hadn&#39;t imposed their illogical will on others. Their obsession with money goes hand in hand with their obsession with world domination and slavery (hence the NWO conspiracy).
Worker wages are going down worldwide so we&#39;re on the road to that fascism against the people.</p>

<p>If the universe gave people what they needed, the elites would not have fortunes in the billions and trillions. And the poor would not be so unfortunate.
There is no balance, most wealth is accumulated by the parasitic elites.</p>

<p>Worse than being materialistic is being parasitic and wanting
humans to serve you as slaves.
Nearly all evil comes from politics which the elites have poisoned for a long time.
There&#39;s an unfathomable amount of injustice in the world.
Savages have ruined things for a long time. By now humanity
should have become more civilized but the elites bring us down closer to their level.</p>

<p>Anyway I think the Bible quote is really just saying
don&#39;t be greedy. But the elites are beyond that.
Most people just want to have comfortable lives
but the elites have deprived the people of happiness
for no logical reason.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a crazy theory that it&#39;s easier for the world
to be evil and bring Jesus faster that way, but
that&#39;s nonsense because it&#39;s really not that difficult to
make the population ethical in our modern times
but those in charge pulling the puppet strings, have polluted everything from
the music industry, hollywood/TV, media, education system, smuggling
drugs into neighborhoods, the &quot;war on drugs&quot; incarceration scam, etc.</p>

<p>Our taxes are used more for corporate profit than
to better the population. This is a deliberate behavior.
Plus, so much horrendous evil has existed,
why did Jesus or God not intervene in the countless times
that evil and injustice has occured for thousands of years?</p>

<p>Arriving just at the moment the world is in a nuclear war or whatever,
doesn&#39;t seem logical to me so it seems like a foolish theory
(I think it comes from freemasonry crap, not sure, will have to search for it again).
I&#39;m just mentioning the theory in case
you were hinting at it when you spoke
of the Bible speeding things up by making us learn from evil.</p>

<p>IMO learning has nothing do with it. That fits more with
the new age stuff that claims life is a school (nonsense, if reincarnation is real,
why do our memories get erased, not much learning is it? Sounds like a mindless video game of pain and suffering.)
Once someone is very ethical already (with a kind heart), they&#39;re still
not necessarily enlightened or saved by Jesus or God.
So I&#39;m not understanding your point properly.</p>

<p>What do you mean by the Bible speeding things up?</p>

<p>I believe we&#39;re at something called &#39;The Great Harvest&#39; which has a lot to do with Cronus. I think it&#39;s referred to as &quot;death&quot; in the Bible to give it a very negative connotation just to get us to see how silly we&#39;ve been when it finally happens. You see, they want us rolling on the floor laughing at ourselves, and at them, when it&#39;s all said and done.</p>
