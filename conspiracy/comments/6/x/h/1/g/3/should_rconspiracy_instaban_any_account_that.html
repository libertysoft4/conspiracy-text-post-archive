        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>If not, why not? What value is there in defending criminals? Here are the best arguments I can come up with against this motion:  </p>

<p>1) But free speech...<br/>
If you want have your ideas, have them, but this isn&#39;t a public square. It&#39;s a private web portal and as such you can&#39;t demand entry. None of us can. If you believe Israeli terrorism is a good thing - start a sub and have at it. But this one is supposed to be about exposing the truths that the Powers that shouldn&#39;t be are hiding from their societies. And this truth - that Israel is currently a criminal enterprise is pretty open and shut as far as the evidence is concerned.  </p>

<p>2)  it they&#39;re god&#39;s chosen people.  </p>

<p>Again, believe what you want - but facts are facts. Their involvement in 9/11, their first strike policies toward their neighbors, their targeting and dehumanizing of Palestinian men women and children is documented fact. And from a religious perspective, look at the orthodox jews: god threw them out of Israel for demanding a king rather than having faith in gods word - they aren&#39;t allowed back to Israel until the messiah comes --- according to jews who actually live by what the Torah teaches.  </p>

<p>So what say you? I struggle to find any benefit to this sub by allowing Israeli terrorist defenders a voice in a sub such as this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not a good idea because it sets a precedent and actions such as these could be used to indirectly target a group. For instance, Republicans have a much higher rate of Israel support. Banning for defending Israel would also indirectly ban a large number of Republican supporters. This isn&#39;t something we want to go down.</p>

<p>As many on here have and many will very shortly come on this post and state. This will only lead to more censorship. It will lead to more division..as people try to defend their beliefs by silencing the beliefs of others.</p>

<p>A user on here has already made the comment that points out this will lead to a dictatorship. They are right. </p>

<p>Are there concerted efforts by groups of people trying to push their agenda or trying to silence the expression of an individual users perceptions? Yes.</p>

<p>Have we figured out the best solution to deal with the issue? No.</p>

<p>Will we ever? Probably not.</p>

<p>What solution has come closest to achieving success regarding speech that is considered offensive by a majority?</p>

<p>Ignoring them.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t even have to list the prime example of this. Everyone already knows what I&#39;m talking about.</p>

<p>There will always be groups of people opposed to a certain topic. Therefore, the only viable answer to the Israel topic is to use accurate information presented in a non-hateful way to simply point out the facts.</p>

<p>If the perceived idea that Israel wields too much influence on US government/policies..the facts supporting this argument will only increase.</p>

<p>If the perceived idea that there are groups of people coordinating attempts to stifle or suppress the presentation of the facts regarding Israel&#39;s influence are true...then the examples of such groups doing so will only increase.</p>

<p>It will inevitably reach a point where it becomes blatantly obvious. </p>

<p>Patience and fortitude coupled with an accurate presentation of the facts is the best strategy.</p>

<p>That is my opinion on the topic of Israel wielding too much influence in this country.</p>

<p>If we cannot practice this rule in the realm of social media..I seriously doubt it will last very long as a standard practice of law in these unpredictable and Orwellianish times.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Social media is not a public square. It is a private entity&#39;s domain. You don&#39;t have the same rights on someone else&#39;s property that you have in the public square.  </p>

<p>How do you think these places of private property can put out signs that ban the second amendment from being practiced on their property?  </p>

<p>Your argument is weak.<br/>
Which lends strength to mine.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you&#39;re against all of the rules of this sub which are various forms of censorship, correct? Facebook links, memes, insults, pointing out issues with this sub etc.... All of THAT censorship should be allowed - but banning the defense of israeli terrorists is going too far with the censorship?  </p>

<p>I sense wild hypocrisy.</p>

<p>B) Check out as what, exactly? </p>

<p>Do you also want to link my arguments with Israeli right-wingers against our current policies in Gaza and the WB?</p>

<p>What you were linking to is a civilized debate between Israelis about our current political crises (yes, plural). Is this the kind of discussion you would wish to shut down in its entirety?</p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry if I threatened your view that Israel is some kind of monolithic sinister entity. I certainly don&#39;t think that about wherever you&#39;re from...</p>
