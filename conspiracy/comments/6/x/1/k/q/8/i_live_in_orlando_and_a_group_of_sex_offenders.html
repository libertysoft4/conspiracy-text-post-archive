<p>Blatant lie.  At this point he knows it&#39;s not an orphanage but a counseling center.  Yet for some reason he&#39;s continuing to push his narrative.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>at the very least has a treatment center for sexually abused children in the same plaza less then a 20 minute was from a pedo half house.</p>

<p>Much closer to the truth.  There&#39;s not really a conspiracy here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not lying what so ever. I have no idea if it was on the news where it happened but he did a plea agreement on 3 of the cases so no one can see what exactly he did as the file is closed and they occurred in different states than the one I live currently. </p>

<p>His violations include: not reporting he was moving into the neighborhood, moving next to 3 houses with multiple children in each household (he not allowed to live next to houses with children, but I don&#39;t remember the exact distance he has to be from households with kids. All I know is that in my state this is a direct violation of the law and his terms of release), he approached several boys in the neighborhood inviting them over, he was unemployed for 2 years though he is not allowed to be unemployed for more than 6 weeks and still be out on probation, he failed to report to the state his change of address for over 2 years so none of us knew about this until he eventually reported it years later and a neighbor who had since moved happened to look up our neighborhood out of curiosity. Oh and he lives too close to 4 different schools and daycares than the law allows him to. There were more, but those are the ones I remember as it&#39;s been many years since we first tried to address this issue.</p>

<p>We reported all of these to his probation officer and the probation officer told us to fuck off and thought it was comical. The sack of shit did not care that he was coming after the boys in our neighborhood. </p>

<p>We could not get him out of the neighborhood. He kept coming after the boys so eventually all those families with boys sold their homes and left. It&#39;s a small neighborhood with only around 30 homes, 4 of which had male children. Those parents could not get help for the issue.</p>

<p>The whole thing is immensely fucked up. We tried several probation officers to try to get him removed but because he owned the house they did not want to deal with it because it is more difficult, or he was paying them off? I honestly don&#39;t understand why anyone in their right mind would protect a fucking pedophile. And certainly one who has multiple charges, across multiple states, of both minor and major (like rape) convictions. </p>

<p>We&#39;ve been dealing with this sack of shit for over 10 years. Fortunately, without any kids in the neighborhood anymore tensions have calmed. I just can&#39;t believe he won. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That was what I wanted to do. But my neighbors were so weird a skittish about it. When we have one of our meeting about it many of the men kept saying &quot;I don&#39;t hate the gays...&quot; blah blah blah, because he guy is also homosexual and has a male partner. Somehow not wanting to look like a bigot outweighed the real issue that the guy was a pedophile. Only my family were the ones saying to just threaten him. But then again, with the probation officers supporting the pedophile and not the kids in the neighborhood, who knows. Threatening him could have just landed one of us in jail. </p>

<p>What I do know about him is that his smaller sized property is covered with high end security cameras. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s not an orphanage, it&#39;s the office of a foster care and adoption agency. </p>

<p>We don&#39;t have orphanages in the US. Children who are in the custody of social services live in a few kinds of places, including regular foster homes, therapeutic foster homes, group homes, and residential treatment facilities. But most often they are in foster homes. Departments of social services contract out with companies like this to provide foster families for children, and the goal for some of those children is to eventually be adopted (rather than returned to their bio families). So in addition to providing foster services for children, these agencies provide training for prospective foster and adoptive parents, as well as help these potential parents navigate the foster care and adoption systems. </p>

<p>But the children don&#39;t live there, they are living with a foster family or in one of the other facilities that I mentioned. Unless you can show me a license for this place being a group home or residential facility, then I have no reason to believe that there are children living on premises. </p>

<p>Your words, not mine.  He didn&#39;t say he didn&#39;t care, he said wrong place, and you think that makes him a pedo sympathizer?</p>

<p>You&#39;ve got basic facts wrong.  There are no children there, because orphanages don&#39;t exist.  There are things called treatment centers, but that s not one of them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Except I already admitted I was mistakenly wrong I thought it was an orphanage. I&#39;m not even on the topic anymore. There&#39;s atrocities in this world that are committed to children and putting our heads in the sand is the reason why. I&#39;m not on the topic of One Hope United anymore I found it weird that a foster agency was so close to pedo halfway house and a treatment center for sexually abused children. I admitted I was wrong about it being an orphanage. We need to care or this whole world is completely fucked </p>
