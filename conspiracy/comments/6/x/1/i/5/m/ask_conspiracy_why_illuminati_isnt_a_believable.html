        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>When I was in 7 to 8th grade, illuminati was one of my favorite things to &quot;investigate&quot;. In 9th grade one of our teachers made us research it. It always seemed like a believable theory. But in the past 2 years people started to make fun of it.. In a strange way. People were talking about &quot;how stupid it is&quot; rather than why. &quot;lizard people&quot; wasn&#39;t the part of the main theory while it was the thing that most people made fun of. Every single youtuber started to make fun of it but not in a way that &quot;ohh it is a meme.&quot; in a more pretentious way. I remember watching pewdiepie&#39;s &quot;life is strange&quot; walktrough and he complained about the amount of illuminati signs in it but then later all of the sudden he started to make fun of illuminati in his videos that had nothing to with it. Then big youtubers like nigahiga doing illuminati signs in his thumbnails, Phil lester wearing an illuminati shirt and many many other sketchy things that put me off that I don&#39;t remember since it was in like 2015. Now, don&#39;t think me as a strong believer of this theory, I just want someone logical (unlike naive me) who looked into the theory and can explain why. I didn&#39;t look into the theory for years so please forgive my stupidity. Here are my questions: Illuminati cards, I think they are the biggest supporter of this, what are your thoughts on it? Are they fake? Why illuminati sign is on a dollar bill? Why there are cartoons that include illuminati signs? (A really clear one is gravity falls) Why celebrities are mentioning illuminati in their music videos? Why it is even in such a game like life is strange? Why there are sketchy, dark and sexual things in kids shows, expecially cartoon network &amp; nickelodeon? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The word is like certain curses that can be used in almost any way. It has references that are more literal like in your research of Germany/Austria in the late 1700s. Some people still take it seriously (like Sam Harris thinks hes part of it) and as for creative works, artists draw inspiration from all over the board, especially traditions that are soaked in symbolism. It&#39;s basically the people sense recorded history that think they &quot;get it&quot; from Pythagorus to Thimas Friedman. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Illuminati as a term has reached pop culture status.</p>

<p>In this regards it refers to some shadowy group of powerful people who are secretly controlling the world.</p>

<p>Many people will argue over whether or not it refers to an actual group of people or something from history or entertainment or something else altogether.</p>

<p>In reality, yes, there currently are groups of powerful people steering world events but they don&#39;t identity with the term Illuminati.</p>

<p>But as a nice catch all phrase, we can call them that to get a point across. Like globalists, or New World Order, etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I said &quot;Jews&quot; because they are actually behind lots of companies that sell products worldwide and they have some pretty good access to the media. So it is very possible for them to be one of those rich people that stir things up. I happen to be Muslim and if I combine your theory with the information my religion provides, you&#39;d get Jinns. I don&#39;t know much about them so this might be wrong, I think they live in space. We believe that there isn&#39;t a specie, a creation created superior than humankind. Jinns are just known to be energies that are like humans. They happen to guess future and the ones you&#39;ll come across most likely to lie and be the bad ones. So interrupting them and playing with the universe&#39;s balance isn&#39;t nice. You would call people who are &quot;aliens&quot; in the terms of Christian vocabluary, posessed. One of the worst case of senarios I heard about them is (which is a person I know) they made themselves seem like that girl&#39;s husband. I guess we aren&#39;t on the different chapters all along, with different beliefs. </p>
