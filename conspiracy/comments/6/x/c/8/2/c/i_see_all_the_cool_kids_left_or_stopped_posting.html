    <div class="md"><p>Ì did not attack another user.  Ì attacked an idea.  Apparently you have trouble making a distinction between the two.</p>

<p>I believe that religion is quite literally a form of insanity, a memetic virus that causes massive psychosis. Interestingly, I was introduced to this concept at university, which, if I&#39;m not mistaken, is where the term &#39;collegial discussion&#39; arose from.  I can see why that would offend a religious person, but I&#39;m not going to say other than what I believe.</p>

<p>I absolutely say &quot;believing in something without evidence is stupid&quot;, because it is. I also say &quot;religion is a form of insanity&quot;.  Those are attacks on <em>ideas</em>.  Attacking ideas is absolutely foundational to discussion in any actual collegial setting.  What I wouldn&#39;t and didn&#39;t  say is &quot;you, userX, are an insane idiot because you believe X&quot;.  See, that would be an attack on another user.</p>

<p>In any case, the fact that none of the mods would even reply to my queries about the ban shows exactly what kind of moderation users can expect there. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>To paraphrase (I provided the link to the exact statements.), saying, &quot;You are likely mentally ill if you believe in God.&quot; to someone who has stated they believed in God is calling them likely mentally ill.  That is an attack and not collegial discussion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry, but an idea is no more or less true because a person doesn&#39;t like it, and no more or less true because of whatever beliefs they hold.  I said what I said because I believe it to be true;  a user&#39;s religious beliefs don&#39;t affect my opinions on the matter.</p>

<p>I stand by what I said:  religion is a form of metal illness.  Sometimes a fairly benign one, and sometimes one with horrific real world consequences.  I can direct you to a number of academics who believe the same, if you like, because I didn&#39;t originate the idea.</p>

<p>I made 3, all were ignored.  FartonToast talked to me because he saw me warning people off in TRC, but not in a mod capacity.  In any case, a conspiracy sub that bans people for having ideas they find offensive is a bit humorous, dontcha think?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They may well.  I find Christianity offensive.  However, I don&#39;t see every mention of Christianity as an attack on me.</p>

<p>Anyways, you&#39;re being disingenious.  You&#39;ve lied several times, you won&#39;t address my point, and I suspect that you&#39;re biased because of personal religious belief.  </p>

<p>I can assure you that I banned you for the attack not your belief in that there is no God.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You still have not addressed my argument.  The link you posted proves my side, because at no time did I attack the person I was talking with, only the idea of religion.</p>

<p>In any case, judging by our relative point totals, the majority agrees with me.  But I can see that this idea is oersonally offensive to you, and that you therefore feel the need to censor it.  Since we can&#39;t agree, here&#39;s my proposal:  you moderate the sub however you like, as is your right, and I&#39;ll keep warning people about wht they can expect there every time I see it discussed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again, paraphrasing, you said, &quot;If you believe in God, you likely have a mental illness.&quot; to someone who believes in God.  That is you saying that the user likely has a mental illness because the user believes in God, which is an attack.</p>

<p>I think most people would find being told that they likely have a mental illness by a random person that they do not even know on the internet is offensive.</p>

<p>I would be fine with your proposal except you are saying things about our sub that are not true.  If you go around saying, &quot;They banned me because I told someone that believes in God that I think people that believe in God likely have a mental illness.&quot; then I am fine with that.</p>
