        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It is my opinion that shilling has evolved. Most of us that have been here for a few years are well aware of the site wide/national and social media propaganda machine socially engineering us to follow certain agendas/narratives. </p>

<p>I believe because of this machine, shilling has turned into something more than just a paid influencer of thought and conversation. I think shilling is now rampant among everyday, non-paid posters across reddit and other social media who actually believe in what they are following and subsequently passing along beliefs that were not theirs in the first place. </p>

<p>I think as a community we need to recognize this and be able to effectively expose this trend without being banned. Thoughts?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The one good thing about rule 10 is that it protects us from the shills calling us shills. </p>

<p>These shills are weird. There are always a few shills but they sometimes come in heavy and heard with some kind of new battle plan to take over this subs belief system but they end up failing and retreating every time. When they come in heavy, they are on every post with some sort of mission like protecting Antifa and Soros. It&#39;s annoying but the only way to stop the shills is to stop the cabal otherwise we will be dealing with this our whole lives. </p>

<p>Also, the best strategy against a shill is to unmask them as a wolf in sheep&#39;s clothing. They tend to lose their argument once that is done. It is best to unmask them by establishing that they are protecting very evil people when they defend cabal members like Soros or whatever it may be. </p>

<p>So how do you plan to determine if someone is talking about something like Trump/Russia (or any other theory) because they&#39;ve been &quot;brainwashed&quot; and not something they&#39;ve looked over and came to their own conclusions?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t care about 4chan LARPers or people like Kim Dot Com trying to sell CDs and get his name publicity again, so I do generally shit on those kinds of posts.

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s because I think the most common theories here have just become lazy and partisan attacks.  Not based on evidence that led to the conclusion, but from having the narrative and continuing it on whatever new story comes along.</p>

<p>For example...I think Soros is a piece of shit, but I don&#39;t believe he&#39;s the controller of every event in the world.  And that seems to be something pushed here a lot.  And when &quot;Soros&quot; is the constant boogieman, I&#39;m going to call those lazy theories out as just more partisan bullshit.</p>

<p>we shouldnt be carpetbombed with duplicate shit posts on the same topic attempting to dominate the front page, we shouldnt have certain topics labeled &#39;unverified allegation&#39; then REMOVED, we shouldnt have selective enforcement of contest mode to fight perceived brigading (with no transparency on methods of determining brigading)</p>

<p>they should be allowed to flourish or fail on their own merits. we&#39;ve seen heavy mod involvement on &#39;accepted topics&#39; while getting gaslit on what &#39;shills&#39; are doing on this sub. complaining about shareblue while the front page is all about hillary soros and antifa. why bitch about shareblue if theyre so impotent?</p>

<p>I think shilling is now rampant among everyday, non-paid posters across reddit and other social media who actually believe in what they are following and subsequently passing along beliefs that were not theirs in the first place. </p>

<p>Can it even be considered &quot;shilling&quot; at that point? The word &quot;shill&quot; has already been so watered down and overused that it doesn&#39;t even really mean anything anymore. Now you want to include users who aren&#39;t being paid, who don&#39;t work for any particular interest, and who are just posted based on their misguided beliefs? Why not just call them what they actually are: gullible and easily manipulated people. </p>

<p>And what exactly do you want to do about them? Just not get banned for calling them out? If don&#39;t call them shills (which they aren&#39;t) and instead address how they are wrong and where they might have gotten misguided then you should be fine. I&#39;ve told plenty of people that their arguments are bad and their facts are wrong without breaking rule 10.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I think I get what you are saying. I&#39;m just not sure what you want to do about it. People are stupid and fall for all sorts of crap. The only way I can think of to combat it is to educate people and provide the information they need to make up their own minds. And I suppose we could crack down on users that are clearly here to push an agenda and nothing else, but that&#39;s a slippery slope that could lead to more censorship. Personally I fall on the side of only doing that in the most extreme cases and let the users sort out the rest on their own. </p>

<p>The mod who banned him for allegedly being an alt is the same mod who bans people for shilling, then when questioned about it accused me of being an alt of the banned user (because why else would I stick up for someone) and reported me to the admins for it which obviously didn&#39;t go the way he wanted.

    <div class="md"><p>Rule 10 does more to protect shills than anything else. If someone is name calling, devolving the conversation away from substance then it&#39;s obvious to any passerby who is who. Why am the word when its existence is a fact? Is there fear of naming what is taking place?  They exist. They&#39;re here. They&#39;re dangerous. Why can&#39;t we call them out? It makes no sense imho.  </p>

<p>Further, I think at this sub who are awake to certain obvious facts about true geopolitical goings on should follow in SOMEWHAT SIMILAR footsteps as T_D and instaban any account that apologizes for Israel which is pretty obviously a terrorist state. Their criminal behavior toward the Palestinians and all of their neighbors in the region as well as America - their involvement in 9-11, dual citizens in our government constantly pushing war - that should be enough to preclude anyone from defending them in a sub like this.  </p>

<p>It would be like starting a sub dedicated to exposing MSM corruption and not only allowing MSM paid operatives a voice here, but protecting them by enacting rules that disallow you from exposing them to the others.  </p>

<p>Imagine going to a protest against builderberg, and when undercover FBI scum show up to provoke violence so the protest gets shut down, the organizers made it impossible for you to point out the undercover provocateurs!  </p>

<p>If someone is blatantly naming calling without evidence , harassingly following someone from comment to comment - ok. They&#39;ve left the arena of ideas. Shut em down. But what about when you conclude someone is disingenuously defending a criminal enterprise and you back it up with a logical argument or evidence from previous postings?  </p>

<p>This post might be a waste because you can always use different words to express the same sentiment, right?  Still wanted to voice those ideas.</p>

<p>you want an enforced echochamber? this doesnt sound like a great idea for a general sub such as this. if you want rules like start some anti israel anti msm sub.</p>

<p>the issue with this is obvious. people quickly resort to calling anyone who disagrees a shill. shills are in the eye of the beholder. if someone has a point you dont agree with, argue and explain why.</p>

<p>if theyre just name calling, theres already rules against that.</p>

<p>Then you stop arguing. You make your point and you walk away. It&#39;s not your job to &quot;shut down&quot; people who resort to intellectual dishonesty, it&#39;s your job to avoid them.</p>

<p>It sounds like you want to silence anyone you disagree with on the assumption that they&#39;re wrong.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I think as a community we need to recognize this and be able to effectively expose this trend without being banned.</p>

<p>You would literally have to delete every single comment that doesn&#39;t provide a full argument, and force all posts to follow academic standards to some degree. Word-limits, premises and supporting statements, along with citations.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this is a SubReddit, not a classroom. You can&#39;t quality control the local Internet pub just because it&#39;s a hotbed of discussions about conspiracies.</p>

<p>If the conversational air is constantly being tainted with disinformation or misinformation it becomes the job of every single person to learn how to differentiate for themselves what is and what is not sound, valid, reasonable, or convincing.</p>

<p>I guess the third phase would be when the propaganda then becomes widely regarded as absolute truth. We&#39;re probably seeing this third phase in the vaccination arena.</p>
