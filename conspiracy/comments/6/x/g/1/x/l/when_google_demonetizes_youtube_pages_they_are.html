        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>One of the most common weapons of the cabal has been to restrict cash flow to disloyal slaves. It&#39;s always a different process but this time around, they created some fake Nazi issue in modern day America and used that excuse to financially attack truth tellers across youtube. (I think even a Ron Paul account was hit.) This Trillionaire organization grew out of the rigged economic system of capitalism and is being used as a weapon to suppress the truth and offer lies instead in order to fool the masses.  </p>

<p>In the old days, the Barbarians would bash disloyal slaves over the head with a club. Today, Barbarians use money to bash disloyal slaves over the head. </p>

<p>Many people think Google earned all those Trillions from hard work but these things are never made in a garage as they claim. High powered bankers and cabal members arrange these giant companies and give them over to some young family member to operate and then they claim that they deserve all those Trillions because they have done SO much good to society when in reality, this highly overpowered Company is using shady 1984 Orewellian tactics to suppress mankind. They are treating this country like an old Totalitarian state like the Stalin era of the USSR on one hand while lying to the people about how &quot;free&quot; and &quot;democratic&quot; the United States is. </p>

<p>These are the things we have to consider because, without a max wage law, the deep state can harvest the whole planet and leave nothing for the 99.9% and then, when they do harvest the planet, they can bash the starving, disloyal slaves in order to keep them in check. Some slaves will remain defiant, others will fall in line. </p>

<p>Edit: Just to clarify, I am talking about Google suppressing friendly channels they call fake news such as the Ron Paul channel or other conspiracy style channels. I&#39;m sure the whole world would be OK with the shutting down channels like ElsaGate or ISIS or a KKK recruitment channel but they keep those up other than shutting down a few for show. What Google did was use the 8/23 false flag event in Charlottsville as an excuse to shut down legitamite sites while claiming to &quot;intend&quot; to shut down hate sites. This is all 4D chess stuff. They had this all planned out and now they are demonetizing legitimate conspiracy style sites to suppress the truth. They could care less about Elsagate sites or Nazi sites. In fact, they love those sites because Google is weaponized and owned by the deep state. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No because there is a genuine reason to ban Elsagate. That channel is a mix of pedo, MK ultra, and trademark violation channel. </p>

<p>Banning channels is needed on extreme channels but they are trying to ban genuine channels by calling them &quot;fake news&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The game is rigged and its giving these dark entities too much power over our lives. They print money, create massive companies like youtube, get us to all use it, and then they weaponize these companies against us. </p>

<p>I really don&#39;t care if youtube guarantees free speech or not. I care that this system is reworked so that we don&#39;t have to depend on some Satan worshipping pedophile at the top of youtube to decide if we should have free speech or propoganda. Media is weaponized as a mind control weapon and this has to be fixed by us instead of expecting a corrupt government to fix itself. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The intel first started leaking out during the Podesta email leaks of 2016. Ever since then, there has been an ocean of evidence pointing to them being Satanists. The Talmud is essentially their evil holy text. </p>

<p>The entire planet and every agency is currently divided between white hat and black hat functions and all these functions are at war with each other. All religions including some buddhists are effected. The Asians are dominated by the White Dragon Society which is a half good, half bad faction. I&#39;m not sure if any of their members are Satanists though. </p>

<p>The entire Catholic Heirschy especially in Rome, the Saudi Arabian elite, the Israeli elite, the American elite, the U.K. Elite, the very popular Christian preachers, and others have entire black hat Satanists factions within them. The west is dominated by the House of Rothschild and the House of Rockafellar which are completely evil factions. </p>

<p>There is a lot to it. For us, Satanism is silly but to them it&#39;s dead serious. </p>

<p>The funny thing is, does it really matter?  People believe in a holographic universe...Good and evil really could be seen as irrelevant, because they are a figment of imagination.  Indeed, not that individuals don&#39;t have a choice, just that there&#39;s not much choice when it comes to the good/evil as a whole. </p>

<p>Me, I would rather err on the side of not being a shitty person, but God is evil, so why should dark imagery be scary?  God is the ultimate decider of the existence of evil, and even an atheist could believe that at the very least the collective unconscious will revolt at some point.  Some shit just don&#39;t fly...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, that&#39;s the interesting thing.  If you believe in life after death, in any fashion, you have to then believe that death is thus an illusion.  A difficult one to grasp fundamentally, because for some reason it just hurts in a way to think of it like that.  But that doesn&#39;t mean LIFE is an illusion.  </p>

<p>People with OBEs report the whole &quot;tether&quot; idea, and one video on Youtube of a Virgin Mary sighting shows her literally attached to a tether going into the atmosphere.  Seriously, the crowd reaction kinda sells this one, and I&#39;m a skeptical bastard.  </p>

<p>Sometimes, I think people use ideas like objectivism or &quot;the matrix&quot; or likewise to justify shitty behavior...&quot;this isn&#39;t real&quot; or &quot;there&#39;s nothing outside yourself&quot; mentality.  But I&#39;d say there is a large breadth between somebody who is flippant towards their own mortality and somebody looking to gain advantage of others.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I think many conspiracies involving satanic or occult leadership within our government or corporations will be scrutinized or minimized as ramblings of paranoid individuals. Honestly, I&#39;m not sure who to believe but I&#39;m now becoming very skeptical in general. There&#39;s so much propaganda that it makes me question the motives of anyone spreading the so called truth. I&#39;m not necessarily aligned with a particular conspiracy &quot;group&quot;, but I can&#39;t help but notice the satanic messages in the media and the alleged parallels of pedophilia in our government. </p>

We just aren&#39;t adept at doing this so it&#39;s like riding a bike for the first time. Give trump until end of year. We should find out a lot more about the truth this year hopefully soon. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sounds like you lost faith in Trump due to his actions, and gained it again due to what &quot;insiders are saying.&quot; Are those insiders interests aligned with keeping Trump in power regardless of what is true, and is that interest aligned with you interest? </p>

<p>IMO you should trust your instincts the insiders are going to bat for Trump until the last rat jumps off the sinking ship.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bruh I&#39;m a fucking communist too but that doesn&#39;t change the reality of the situation. YouTube is a private business and they are under zero obligation to pay for server space to host content that they find objectionable. People who are taken off of YouTube have a number of other platforms they can go to, or they can make their own. This is the reality of free speech in our free market economy.</p>

<p>Once the means of production have been seized and we <em>actually</em> own YouTube, it would be good to regulate it to a high standard that ensures open and honest access to the platform. But until then, they&#39;re going to play to their advertisers, and the advertisers don&#39;t want their ads supporting far right nationalists or other undesirables.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In ommunism, the government owns everything. In sacred economics, the people own everything.  </p>

<p>The secret the changing reality is for all of us to change our belief system. The most optimal belief system is the correct one and so we have to keep raising the bar until we get there. As of now, I believe we all own everything including google. When enough people do this, natural domino effects are unleashed to match our belief system. It&#39;s very complicated stuff but that&#39;s how it works. The elite hold their power when we concent to their rules. Once the concent is removed and a new, more noble, belief system replaces it, then that new belief system eventually becomes a reality. This has been actually happening for a while now. We may potentially enter into a new age soon. The old system is falling apart before our eyes because it is based on false beliefs. Any system based on false beliefs will end up falling apart.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look, most of us are a little lazy. I&#39;ve been to vid.me about once, after countless urgings by youtubers facing demonetization. And it&#39;s obviously not as big as youtube, doesn&#39;t have the range and depth of content. Of course this could change; youtube is on the verge of becoming a product that is of no use to us! Now that &quot;controversial&quot; videos are not being indexed, with comments and ratings disabled. Who wants that? </p>

<p>What is blindingly obvious is that google and Facebook have virtually carved up the web into a cosy duopoly between them. They want to tell us what to watch and what to think! Teddy Roosevelt was known as the &quot;trust buster&quot;. The next &quot;trust buster&quot; will be the one who takes on the internet giants. Let&#39;s see who has the stomach for that fight.</p>

<p>In the meantime the smart cookies among us need to build an internet that circumvents google and Facebook and most importantly, can give content providers a way to make money. You know what would be great? A video channel where giving money was as simple as hitting the &quot;like&quot; button. In the meantime, us dummies should get out of our lazy habits and seek out the alternatives like vid.me and build them up. God knows, we might need a new Reddit someday...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>ISIS is a full blown terror group, KKK and Nazis are essentially terror groups as well so I would be OK with it but we really need to be voting on this stuff in very quick ways. All of us need to vote on almost all policies; not just this one. We need to remove the power from the hands of the wicked few and put it into the hands of the many where we can create a transparent, mass voting system that can&#39;t be hacked. </p>

<p>Keep in mind, they tell you they are targeting Nazi stuff as a cover but they are actually going after truth tellers like the Ron Paul channels they took down. They probably close a few Nazi sites down for show but Google is FRIENDS with Nazis just like the rest of the cabal are. I&#39;m talking about real political Nazis, not the street thugs. </p>

<p>Nope. That&#39;s where you&#39;re completely wrong and completely insane. You&#39;re never going to eliminate trade completely, the entire structure of society is built on the concept of equitable trade.

    <div class="md"><p>A gifting economy is where people work jobs and work for free and consume for free. No one person is responsible for it all. The government isn&#39;t even involved in it. </p>

<p>For example, I run the ice cream store for 5 hours a day/5days a week. You run the tire shop. Another person runs the train station. People choose their own jobs. Everyone just works a small part of the economy and we will win. They are hiding 1000 year supply worth of all the resources you can imagine plus about 50-100 years worth of technology. Once we get our hands on that, we can easily make this happen and we can get our hands on it. </p>

<p>Also, keep in mind that Capatalism is why resources run out quickly. People are trying to sell-sell-sell as fast as possible to build a cash flow so it is in their best interest to push every vile piece of garbage through endless media ads like TV commercials or Billboards. If we stop selling, the economy will fall apart but in a gifting economy, people won&#39;t use as much commercials because it doesn&#39;t even matter to them if business or good or bad. All that matters is that they are holding down the fort at some business somwehre in the world so that other people can consume there. Without the endless ads brainwashing and twisting everyone&#39;s arm into buying stuff they dont&#39; even need, overall consumption would go down. </p>

<p>Just think about the amount of food we throw away every day. That in itself is enough to feed the world 3 times over but restaurants are forced to dump it in the garbage because of the stupid rules we have set up. </p>

<p>We have enough for a life of decency for all of us. Heck, wait until you see the incredible 3D printer technology that will end up rednering many retail stores obselete. The problem is its all held back from us thanks to the cabal patenting the technology and slowly (very slowly) leaking it out into the economy for power and profit reasons. This is garbage... It&#39;s not working. We need something that works for all of us, not just the top 10,000 richest people on Earth. All those lies they spew about people working hard and becoming future millionaires are total lies to keep you busy for the next 25 years as a slave. By the time people grow up and see that it was a lie, they feel like they wasted their whole lives away.</p>

<p>This simply doesn&#39;t work. The wages that we pay people for specialized skills exist because those skills are difficult, unpleasant, or require expertise and education which many people are either unable or unwilling to undertake.</p>

<p>You have to be able to incentivize jobs which people would be unwilling to do without an incentive, otherwise those jobs simply don&#39;t get done. In the past this was accomplished through barter by people evaluating the worth of their own time, but that requires a co-incidence of wants and is extremely cumbersome.</p>

<p>We need to get our robots working all the menial jobs so that we can move up to more interesting stuff. Also, people are not as selfish as you think. If a city is lacking garbage men,  they will post ads and utilize employee finding companies to recruit the garbage men they need. In the meantime, we have 50-100 years worth of technology being withheld from us. We need to get that tech and build robot workers with them to free us up from much of the menial labor jobs. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I hardly think that everyone working on robots will have to know how to build them from the ground up.  The wheel has already been built, and it&#39;s more or less just getting people used to the basics.  Auto techs don&#39;t need a college degree, and the same will eventually be true for robot workers.  Not many auto workers can reprogram modern ECU&#39;s, let alone BUILD one.  </p>

<p>You act like &quot;cash&quot; still has meaning anymore, as if it hasn&#39;t been a farce for a while.  A good government would &quot;invest&quot; in self-driving cars in the interest of simple human welfare, and I fail to see how it must be done completely &quot;free&quot; for everyone, in a cash based economy or not.  In a more rational society job-based commuting would be limited or non-existent, so the demand would not be as great.  </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

<p>Cash is simply a measuring stick used to value one&#39;s efforts and outputs against the outputs and efforts of someone else. Even if it only has the meaning we give it (since it&#39;s no longer backed by anything), it still has that meaning and is thus an incentive to get people to do things which they wouldn&#39;t normally do if given absolute freedom of choice.</p>

<p>Absolute freedom of choice cannot exist unless the the entirety of our modern society being rewritten. Given absolute freedom to consume and absolute choice as to what to do, any task of sufficient difficulty, complexity, or risk will be left undone.</p>

<p>You can take away the stick, you can take away the carrot, but you cannot take away both.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So tax the extremely wealthy and introduce universal income?</p>

<p>Anyone who believes that trying to abolish currency completely and return to a barter system or introduce a utopia where everyone gets everything they desire is delusional. There will <strong>always</strong> be scarcity of resources, even if that scarcity is confined to only specific extremely rare items or extremely difficult services.</p>

<p>I wholly agree with you that there are plenty of ways we can make society better, but abolishing currency is not one of them.</p>

<p>Raw materials which are mineral or energy based will become nearly free, but raw materials like foodstuffs which aren&#39;t lab grown will be increasingly scarce unless we suddenly invent extremely sophisticated replication technology.</p>

<p>Another example is say I want to move 8 blocks to the East somewhere. Instead of moving all that furniture, I just give it to he next man who lives there so he becomes the caretaker. If I don&#39;t find furniture in the new place, I can just order it for free and get brand new furniture. </p>
