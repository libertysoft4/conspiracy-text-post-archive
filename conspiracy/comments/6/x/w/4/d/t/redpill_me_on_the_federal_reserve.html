    <div class="md"><p>Hello I&#39;ll answer some </p>

<ol>
<li><p>It depends on the type of cryptocurrency, which, like ordinary currency, can be bullion or fiat.  Bulleon currencies, ones with intrinsic value, is the best way to avoid the never ending debt cycle.</p></li>
<li><p>Debt in a fiat reserve currency has be considered as a totally different beast than debt of  a non reserve currency nation. If the latter defaults, one could print money, but inflation would eat the value. however if the reserve nation defaults printing the money to square the debt results the inflation being exported to all non reserve currencies.  The short answer to why the US has so much debt is because they can, knowing full well non us citizens will work to square the deficit.  Challenging the dollar hegemony has been at the root of all 21st century conflict.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>It is also of use to point out that, in a fiat system, money is created by creating debt then charging interest on it.  So it&#39;s a mathematical impossibility to completely pay off the debt, since there&#39;s always more debt than credit</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Bitcoin is bullion, so it&#39;s a step in the right direction.  Taxes cause deadweight loss in markets, less taxes generally help economies.</p></li>
<li><p>No idea, but it seems the deep state had every incentive to.</p></li>
<li><p>Yes, fiat currency is absolutely a ponzi scheme, designed specially to force a society to endenture itself to itself.  </p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>While tangible value is a good layman&#39;s way of approaching bullion, it&#39;s actually too strict, all thats needed for a bullion system is a scarce good.

<p>This is false, we can pay down he debt in relatively short time without cutting any spending.  Your premise is based off of current US income.</p>
