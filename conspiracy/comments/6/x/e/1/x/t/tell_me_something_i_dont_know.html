    <div class="md"><p>Records of pirate ships flying flags that signified they were pirates go back just about as far as history is recorded. Of the Jolly Roger line though, the earliest reference is probably of the skull and crossbones flag used by the Knights Templar, who had the world’s biggest naval fleet in the 13th century and were well known for their pirate-like acts on the sea. Interestingly, Templar graves were often marked with the same skull and crossbones as on the Jolly roger (1).</p>

<p>When the Knights Templar dissolved, with many members forming the Knights of Malta who were equally known for their piracy, they also were known to fly the skull and crossbones.</p>

<p>rogerThe most famous Templar Pirate was Roger de Flor (1266-1306). He was also the most famous Templar who was a Templar Sergeant, and not a knight. Roger de Flor (also known by his original German name of Rutger von Blume) was a captain in the Templar fleet (2). After he got banished from the Order on charges of extorting money from passengers during the siege of Acre in 1291, Roger fled to Genoa, where he borrowed a considerable sum from Ticino Doria, purchased a new vessel and began a career in piracy.[1]</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s something the average poster here very obviously does not know: <em>libertarian socialism</em> is a thing. This, consequently, should indicate to any rational thinker that the oft-repeated misconception that socialism = big gubment is patently false. <em>Marxism-Leninism</em> (which is itself distinct from &quot;Marxism&quot;) advocates for the application of socialism via the state. In particular through a single party &quot;revolutionary vanguard.&quot; But marxism-leninism is only one socialist ideology. </p>

<p>In contrast, anarcho-syndicalism (as an example of libertarian socialism, though there are other similar ideologies) advocates direct, democratic worker ownership of the means of production, with representation elected from workplaces/trade unions to represent lower levels of organization at the syndicate and overall federal level. Anarchism is not &quot;no government,&quot; but rather anarchists support limited, democratic government and the abolition of unjust hierarchies. </p>

<p>If more people were aware of alternative ideologies maybe we wouldn&#39;t be presented with such a loathsome false dichotomy between &quot;big government controls everything&quot; and total &quot;free market&quot; anarchy wherein the vast majority are at the complete mercy of the most powerful capitalists.</p>

<p>P.s. there are even capitalist alternatives which are almost <em>never</em> discussed, like Left Wing Market Anarchism, which is generally opposed to <em>corporations</em> as well as government influence, because corporations serve as vehicles for certain individuals to receive unfair state sanctioned privileges. That sounds like something 90% of posters here would support (if you didn&#39;t call it &quot;left wing&quot;)...</p>

</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s just the modern rebranding of Anarchism and that definition only lives  in places like  r/Anarchism.</p>

<p>No matter what you want to say what it is, Anarchism is and has always been &quot;no government&quot;, it is literally based on the greek word anarkhos or &quot;without a chief&quot;, no democratic anything, it is plainly no governance of any kind and rejecting state anything.</p>

<p>Practical and  by majority use of Anarchism is just that, it not some BS retelling, or system of this and that, it is rejecting governance in any form. And most commonly the means to accomplish it are violent.</p>

<p>Again, no matter what you want it to be what you said(and you spend a lot of time trying to rebrand anarchism), reality will not change.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You really don&#39;t have any idea what you&#39;re talking about, probably because you&#39;re insisting that there is only one definition for the word and that anarchism as a political philosophy is non existent. Again, I guess someone should inform the ghosts of Godwin, Proudhon, Kropotkin et al that they and their work apparently does not exist. You&#39;re digging your head in the sand going &quot;bbbbbut the Greek!&quot; as though the Greeks even had a conception of a political philosophy that has only formally existed for around three centuries. </p>

<p>People can call themselves whatever they want, but that doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re using those terms accurately, or that their use of the term is the only application. Is a violent extremist who wishes to destroy all government an anarchist? Certainly. Is a tradesman who wishes to support an anarcho-syndicalist takeover via trade unions <em>also</em> an anarchist? Also yes. However the former has no philosophical underpinnings to his ideology and the latter is advocating an anarchic form of government. </p>

<p>You seem like the kind of guy who refers to anything he doesn&#39;t like a Marxist, who then accuses others of &quot;bogging him down in definitions&quot; when corrected. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nextrad radar stations are using Tesla technology to manipulate weather patterns. HAARP was the research facility in Alaska sure, yet the 165 Nextrad radar stations are the pulse generation for stratospheric aerosol injection aka cloud seeding. The state of Colorado has a state website to apply for permits of weather modification and the military has used these types of technical assistance on the battle field for decades. When I see Hurricane Harvey (88) or (Hiel Hitler) hits Houston (88) etc i just think wow it&#39;s on the anniversary of Katrian and Occultic codes dare telling of a gang signature like graffiti on the wall. I think events in the world are far more controlled and scripted than ever before in human history... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Check out the Law of One: Ra Material</p>

<p>Extraterrestrials that are billions of years ahead of human civilization define Infinity as Unity, ultimately everything is part of All there is/Infinity and thus everything can&#39;t help but be the Creator/Universe experiencing itself.</p>

<p>Nature of reality/existence is of Oneness. Everything is Divine, there is only truly Freewill. Law of One also talks about the creation story of &quot;God&quot;/existence as well in session 13

<p>Here are some favorite Law of One quotes from Q&#39;uo:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The heart of your journey is to seek the Creator that is within you, the Creator that you are, the Creator that is all things. There can be no other way of looking upon an infinite creation of unity. The Creator took pleasure in making this, what you call creation, in order that it might know itself through the free will of each of its entities that it has created. From the Logos of every star within your skies, to the planet upon which you dwell, to each of your entities that you share the illusion with, each of you has free will to exercise however you wish. Each exercise of free will teaches the Creator more of itself, and fulfills the purpose of the illusion. Each of your actions reveals more to you of yourself, and if you are conscious of the seeking process, of the Creator itself, it is a journey of lovers, the creator loving you with unending love, you seeking and loving the Creator with a growing love. At some point, you will find the Creator, there is no other outcome for the end of this journey. At some point, the creator will know all that you know and will thank you for all that you have taught it of itself. At some point every entity within this great one infinite creation will coalesce again into unity, bringing home to the Creator the fruits of this journey through the octave of densities in which you now travel. Q&#39;uo transcripts September 4, 2016</p>
</blockquote>

<p>as well as </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Let us look first at the first choice and that was the choice of the Creator to know Itself. In choosing to know Itself the Creator flung from Itself innumerable and infinite sparks of love which coalesced into each awareness that dwells within the infinite awareness. Each of those sparks of awareness is the Creator, and yet, because the Creator chose free will in the manifesting of sparks of self, each spark is unique and has been unique since before time began. Each of you is eternal and in many ways immutable, a citizen of infinite nature, worth and value. Each one a holograph of the Creator and yet each one different.
Thus, the choice that birthed each of you was a choice to know the truth, to know the self, and as the Creator is love, so is each entity love. This is the central truth. This is that which does not change. Yet this is that which is ever wrapped in mystery. Each within this circle has come through many planes of existence, has learned a great deal, and each within this circle chose not only this incarnation now being experienced but also that cast of characters with whom each entity interacts in the family, in the close associations of friends, and all those who have significant connections with the self. There were agreements made before incarnation, most notably with the parents and those within the bonds of kinship of blood and of commonality of interest. Each difficulty, each crux that leaves one in a position of being forced to discover the self has been placed not with a hand that desires to punish but with a hand of loving self that wishes to serve ever more deeply, ever more purely. -Q&#39;uo @the_law_of_one (May 18, 1997)</p>

<p>different researchers think different specifics but they all seem to agree the coverup is real.</p>

<p>most of the researchers really getting into this are russian or eastern european and literally every day they are producing interesting proofs that challenge current historical narrative.</p>

<p>But even just studying the official history while entertaining the premise that a lot of it is made up can allow use to catch glimpses of the truth. If we read the wiki for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Justus_Scaliger">Joseph Justus Scaliger</a> we learn that it wasn&#39;t until around 1600 that anyone cared to record or possibly fabricate the history of the non roman world </p>

<blockquote>
<p>But these works, while proving Scaliger&#39;s right to the foremost place among his contemporaries as Latin scholar and critic, did not go beyond mere scholarship. It was reserved for his edition of Manilius (1579), and his De emendatione temporum (1583), to revolutionize perceived ideas of ancient chronology—to show that ancient history is not confined to that of the Greeks and Romans, but also comprises that of the Persians, the Babylonians and the Egyptians, hitherto neglected, and that of the Jews, hitherto treated as a thing apart; and that the historical narratives and fragments of each of these, and their several systems of chronology, must be critically compared. It was this innovation that distinguished Scaliger from contemporary scholars. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>when you realize that this one mans theories forms the entire basis of modern chronology the rest comes apart much easier.</p>
