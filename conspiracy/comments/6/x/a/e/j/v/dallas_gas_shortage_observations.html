        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>We are having gas shortages in Dallas right now (I think other cities in TX are experiencing this too). It seems to be caused by issues with refineries in Houston coupled with a self-fulfilling prophecy of people fueling the shortage because they believe there is no gasoline and are filling up every container they own full of gas. Labor Day gasoline demand probably isn&#39;t helping either.</p>

<p>Some of the gas stations are saying they may not have gasoline until next week while others have some to offer. People are waiting in massive lines to get gas- if they can find a place with fuel. I&#39;ve had former students tell me that they have seen fights in gas stations. Posts from some Dallas friends on Facebook show extreme concern and fear. </p>

<p>Home depot is currently out of gas cans and my husband saw a few people pushing their cars on the highway because they ran out of gas and couldn&#39;t fill up anywhere. Others have seen large groups of people filling up multiple containers, cutting people off in lines and becoming aggressive- near collisions in gas stations. It&#39;s not full on Mad Max mob mentality, but damn, it&#39;s really making my SHTF spidey senses tingle. </p>

<p>Furthermore, while r/dallas has removed most of the posts related to the shortage, the comments were full of people who had no concept of basic economics- it was super disturbing. I&#39;m totally convinced that if we were in a real grid-down scenario of some kind (or if gasoline was simply unavailable for an extended period of time) most people would have no clue how to cope and would likely become very desperate, very quickly. They would probably become mob-like quickly and would likely fall prey to shady government &#39;solutions.&#39; </p>

<p>While I am prepared to handle a crisis scenario better than most people, I admit I have some work to do. This is a huge reminder that our normal lives are highly dependent on a few industries that, if disrupted, can turn our unprepared neighbors into a desperate mob and our highways into deathtraps. </p>

<p>I enjoy this community greatly and hope everyone here strives to make themselves as independent of the system as possible and has a plan to evacuate from a high-density population area if needed. </p>

<p>Edit: one of my former students says he&#39;s seen convoys of vehicles hit up multiple gas stations all at once to fuel up and essentially push everyone else waiting out of the way. Damn.</p>
