        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">6</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2017-09-03 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/JournalismSureIsDead.html">JournalismSureIsDead</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I was listening to Ben Shapiro&#39;s podcast the other day and he started going on about how evil Putin was and that he is a dictator, etc etc. Basically the worst person on the planet.</p>

<p>I disagreed with that, so I went and did some searching to find out what evil things Putin had done.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t say I found much. </p>

<ul>
<li>Some unproven accusations of Putin &quot;murdering journalists&quot; or hiring assassins, with no proof. (not saying innocent). </li>
</ul>

<p>For example, &quot;Anna Politkovskaya&quot;. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Politkovskaya">wikipedia page</a> says &quot;Five men were sentenced to prison for the murder, but it is still unclear who ordered or paid for the contract killing&quot;</p>

<p>Yet, on <a href="http://www.debate.org/opinions/is-putin-evil">Debate.org</a> they claim &quot;Putin ordered the killings of journalists and human rights activists like Anna Politkovskaya&quot;, as well as other ridiculous claims like &quot;He has murdered thousands of people (mostly children) in Syria.&quot;, &quot;The Russian economy has deteriorated&quot; (does that make him evil?), &quot;He has committed horrendous acts of horror via his Chechen zombie idiot , e.g. mass genocide of homosexuals in Chechnya. He supports both Assad and ISIS.&quot; (Putin is fighting ISIS?)</p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen conferences where Putin talks about America&#39;s deep state, and how they are an embarrassment and are shitting themselves thanks to this election, so I can see why there would be valid intentions for such a big disinformation campaign from the western/American press to paint him the villain.</p>

<p>So, what is it? </p>

<p><strong>TLDR: What absolutely verifiable, proven things has Putin done that demonstrate how evil he is? Please no unproven accusations or speculation</strong></p>

<p>EDIT: People STILL somehow managed to bring up unproven accusations and speculation</p>

<p>EDIT: 90 comments overnight. Not a single piece of verifiable evidence that Putin is evil. You&#39;d think if Ben Shapiro considered him the most evil person in the world, that there&#39;d be good reasons why. Apparently not?</p>

<p>EDIT: Shills and bots out in full force now, multiple accusations of being a Russian shill. Still no examples other than accusations and speculations (which I specifically asked to NOT bring up). Pretty pathetic</p>

To me, beyond the massive global military movements, power posturing taken place since since the general filled coronation of &#39;america first&#39;, the reaffirmation of the alliance between putin and xi just before the g20 was an indication of the scale of the clash. i think nk is a puppet piece in this affair. </p>

The Western media compared him to Hitler, yet he gave the majority of his oil proceeds back to the Libyan people. Does that make him a &quot;good guy&quot;? I don&#39;t think so. He was a megalomaniac. In fact, I think all of your world&#39;s leaders are megalomaniacs. They are narcissistic sociopaths who would murder their opposition in a heart beat.

    <div class="md"><p>The thing is that Putin didn&#39;t want to be controlled by the bankers. The US went around Putin to Anatoly Chubais who together convinced the IMF to loan money to Russia in the early 90&#39;s (Bill Clinton and Podesta era). Of course the money didn&#39;t go to the people of the country like it was supposed to - the majority of it was stolen by higher-ups and laundered through the bank of New York and other banks. </p>

<p>There have been hints that this was part of the debt that was coming due in September 11 - but I have not researched that further. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Saddam Hussein was taken out for trading his oil for euros instead of USD. That was a specific OPEC extraction. That is all we care about with the middle East. Hussein had started trading this way in 2000. His fate was sealed before 9/11.</p>

<p>Iran started trading oil for euros in March. Congress passed a measure to allow the invasion back in january. The white house has been trying to get the UN to find Iran in violation of the nuclear deal. History is literally repeating itself and nothing about our actions in the middle East is a secret these days.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Putin is likely the one hooking North Korea up with weapons. They&#39;re still on the axis of evil side of this board game. No amount of mental gymnastics will change that. If you think they&#39;re good guys, you are a total moron.</p>

And I don&#39;t think he is a swell guy, but seeing how much the media and IC lies, and how much vested interest TPTB have in keeping Putin painted in the worst light possible, I don&#39;t think any reasonable person that understands all the situation could fault me for having questions. </p>

<p>And I&#39;m sure some shills will roll through with a wall of text of WaPo and Snopes links showing me just how evil Putin is, but I am not accepting MSM as part of my premise here. That won&#39;t stop them though lol.</p>

<p>People act in their own best interests for the most part (the mentally ill and religious fundamentalists withstanding).  The more cartoonishly evil an individual or group is made out to be, the more I tend to believe that portrayal may be a misrepresentation or exaggeration and there is usually an aspect which is being purposefully ignored to make them look worse.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cleaning up all the reports on this thread and it&#39;s funny, you gave specific and reasonable terms to your request, no one met them, and the thread degenerated into the usual slide attacking you and anyone who might ask similar questions. Why is it so hard to come up with a few specific facts? You weren&#39;t even asking for a preponderance of details, just some specifics. But this was a replay of the same vague notions parroted by the MSM for years that are used by the whole world to damn this guy. The evidence for pizzagate is more compelling lol.</p>

<p>I keep coming back to the Rothschilds and central banks myself. Putin&#39;s rejection of the most powerful banking system in the world makes me very skeptical as a CT. We know someone that does this is a target. And people mention Ukraine. I was on this sub when that went down. The consensus back then was that was a CIA coup. But now? Interesting, that wasn&#39;t even brought up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You won&#39;t find much &#39;absolutely verifiable&#39; evidence when dealing with a former-KGB oligarch, man.</p>

<p>So, what you have to do is look at him as the sum of his parts. We all know he&#39;s ex-KGB. That should speak for itself, if you&#39;ve studied anything about the Cold War. Think CIA with even less need for restraint.</p>

<p>He is also probably the richest man in the world, valued at something like <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/former-kremlin-banker-putin-is-the-richest-person-in-the-world-until-he-leaves-power-2015-7">$200 billion</a>. Meanwhile, Russia sits at 10th on the global GDP rankings. How do you amass $20 billion in wealth when you run a relatively poor country? The answer of course is massive corruption and money laundering. </p>

<p>Then there&#39;s the fact that much of his major political opposition seems to die or end up hospitalized and disfigured. It&#39;s a long list, but <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jun/29/gunman-found-guilty-murdering-russian-opposition-leader-boris-nemtsov">Boris Nemtsov</a> was a recent one. There&#39;s also Boriz Berezovsky, Sergei Magnitsky, Anna Politkovskaya (whom I notice you&#39;ve already dismissed,) and Alexander Litvinenko. There are more, but I trust you can handle your own research. If you want the Russians to investigate these murders and blame Putin as proof, I don&#39;t know what to tell you. It simply will never happen. </p>

<p>It&#39;s also pretty hazardous to be a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_journalists_killed_in_Russia">journalist</a> in Russia. </p>

<p>Then there&#39;s his foreign affairs. Like the US, Russia has a long history of &#39;managing&#39; its sphere of influence. Putin accomplishes this by sowing division in countries and then encouraging the election of Russia-friendly, right-wing candidates. Viktor Yanukovych, the guy who fled to Russia and is currently wanted for high treason in Ukraine, is probably the most famous example of this. He&#39;s the guy Manafort worked for. </p>

<p>All of it points to him being a very wealthy and powerful sociopath whose life probably depends on his absolute control of a nation renowned for its organized crime and corruption. Do you think he could have gotten where he is as a &#39;good guy?&#39; The idea is absurdly naive. </p>

<p>Stop right here. This just means that Russia does not poor. In fact, being at the 10th position means that they are actually quite rich. Not US rich but still. So Putin has 200 billion $ isn&#39;t exactly that unbelievable, when especially that he beat the shit out of the Russian Oligarchs in 2000 and make nearly every remaining oligarchs under his own rule.</p>

<p>Not a logical argument. I didn&#39;t call for no speculation allowed in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, just this post that I wrote. If you can&#39;t handle the idea of a topic on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> being discussed only with facts and not speculation, then I pity you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That Business Insider link is actually a prime example.</p>

<p>Open it up. First thing you see is a picture of Putin toasting someone at a dinner, with a slightly &quot;evil&quot; look on his face. That sets up the tone of the article to be &quot;putin is evil&quot; already. </p>

<p>Then this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Although Putin’s exact wealth is unclear, hedge fund manager Bill Browder previously estimated it at $US200 billion during an interview with CCN’s Fareed Zakaria.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So not &quot;something like 200 billion&quot;, it&#39;s &quot;this one guy estimates it to be&quot;. Spot the difference?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The “first eight or 10 years about reign over Russia was about stealing as much money that he could,” Browder added.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>More opinions of some guy with no authority on the matter.</p>

<p>So, a great example of the western media portraying Putin as a villian, but providing <strong>no actual content or reasons</strong>, just some hedge fund manager saying things about him.</p>

<p>He is ex-KGB. He likely knows all about the CIA and I would guess that he wants to see them fall. He despises NATO and has taken control of his country. Russians are proud people, yes? </p>

<p>Is he killing journalists? I absolutely would not put it past the man. I do have to wonder if that&#39;s just more of the real criminals&#39; projection onto enemies. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think you understand, you don&#39;t get to make the rules, no matter whatever warped reality you live in. You&#39;ve got other posts where you talk about all the mental disorders everyone else has.. have you really looked at yourself critically?</p>

<p>If you truly wanted an answer that might attempt to follow your &quot;rules&quot;, go to r/askreddit r/history r/explainlikeimfive or other places that has a greater variety of people from around the globe.</p>

<p>But you asked in r/conspiracy, where people assume that anyone who dies who&#39;s met a Clinton, was murdered by a Clinton. But the ties are often nebulous at best.</p>

<p>Now there&#39;s Putin, and literally hundreds of direct ties, nothing that is stretching, literally you say something bad about him, you die.</p>

<p>You didn&#39;t answer the most important question is saw you were asked: if it wasn&#39;t him, who else was it? I think you replied with &quot;you don&#39;t wanna know.&quot; But actually, we do.</p>

<p>Because you&#39;re either mentally ill in your thought process, &quot;no matter how many very tight ties he has to deaths, he&#39;s innocent of them all, until someone can absolutely prove it true.&quot; See, the rational mind uses logic. The Clinton&#39;s going around killing people for some very loose ideas seems pretty absurd, but at some point, there&#39;s a tipping point.</p>

<p>So, guy who doesn&#39;t get to make the rules, because there&#39;s already rules, and you have the authority of nothing.. if you&#39;re so smart, and somehow it ISN&#39;T Putin, then who is it?</p>

<p>Because if you don&#39;t answer, you&#39;re obviously just some bored Russian either defending or getting paid to push Russian propaganda.</p>

<p>And if you ACTUALLY AREN&#39;T, you need to really look at your life choices, your messages and views.. and realize you&#39;re the exact type trying so hard to change the views of actual Americans, in the Donald, here, and everywhere else, in a very unamerican way.</p>

<p>And if you don&#39;t answer to ANY of that, then answer this: why did you ask a question in such a way that you obviously believed can&#39;t be answered. What IS your agenda?</p>
