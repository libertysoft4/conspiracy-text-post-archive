        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>A few days ago I made an impassioned shout out to all the people who lived through the last year on r/conspiracy and paid attention. I referenced the iconic post of a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6wokr8/a_new_form_of_protest/?ref=share&amp;amp;ref_source=link">new form of protest</a>.</p>

<p>My post pointed out the huge propaganda backlash that was created by all the mini-conspiracies spawned during and after the 2016 election cycle.</p>

<p>This is my report back to you:</p>

<p>1800 views. 72% upvoted. 107 comments. </p>

<p>Out of those 107 comments, I can count only 9 direct responses (good, bad, or in-between) that honestly responded to my actual point about there being a huge backlash that changes the tone of discussion here. </p>

<p>That means - if I am right - this single post caught 98 comments intended to do exactly the thing I called out - blow smoke on a serious discussion. Thats 91% of comments in the post that may well be ultimately aimed at derailing the discussion.</p>

<p>See for yourselves. </p>

<p>I call the propaganda threads out as sliders. I think they are specifically aimed to slide off one topic (the backlash) and into another (drumpf, russia, jews, etc).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You described what you did because you’re not looking at the end.</p>

<p>We haven’t gotten to the end.</p>

<p>Don’t think we have.</p>

<p>And until we do, you cannot cast judgement upon what that end will be based uno how things have been.</p>

<p>I don’t deny that there is a lot of resistance.  Of course.  However, don’t think for a second that just because the dark side may have an upper hand here and there that this means that truth doesn’t win in the end.</p>

<p>Truth DOES win in the end.</p>

<p>You’re going to die.  I’m going to die.  They’re going to die.</p>

<p>Everyone’s going to die - physically-speaking anyway.  And upon that moment will a <em>lot</em> of things get answered that currently remain hidden.</p>

<p>The bullshit that occurs right now/right here today is not nor will it be as strong as what occurs upon the moment of your shedding this physical vehicle.</p>

<p>If you think about things superficially and in the here and now only, then perhaps you might think that “we have lost” or that “they have gotten the upper hand”.</p>

<p>I don’t think about things in such ways, however.</p>

<p>It’s about perspective, ultimately.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>This comment shows that you know what neither truth is nor what good or “playing by the rules” is either.</p>

<p>TPTB are “playing by the rules”.  You just don’t understand that those rules are cosmic and <em>quite</em> a lot grander and more vast than what you have any idea about.</p>

<p>In your current state of limitation you won’t be able to “outwork the shill farms” or properly fight.  In your current state of limitation, you think the way you described here - that “good is dumb”.</p>

<p>Expand your perspective and understand that even TPTB and all the things they do which can legitimately be considered horrible present opportunities for you to evolve your identity and become a better and stronger and more intelligent and evolved being.</p>

<p>You can’t give up and resign yourself to as horribly defeatist an attitude as you are presenting here, however.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You don&#39;t have to believe anything.  Matter of fact, I encourage you to <em>not</em> believe anything.  &quot;Belief&quot; is weak.  It&#39;s what people cling to when they don&#39;t have an actual intelligent assessment of a thing.</p>

<p>Stay away from it.  Strive for knowledge.  Go for data.  Think critically in your life, and arrive at the best perspectives you can about existence and the cosmos around you.</p>

<p>Also make sure and question what it is you take in as and call &quot;proof&quot;.  You may find that actual reality is a lot more difficult to categorize and pin down than that which you can &quot;prove&quot; via the conventional human channels.  Those channels are themselves often faulty.  There are a lot of very real phenomena in existence that defy what in simple human terms can be &quot;proven&quot;.  If you spend your life tied only to that which falls under what convention says you can &quot;prove&quot;, then you will miss out on a <em>lot</em> of very real phenomena.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No problem with questioning.  It is important to know when one&#39;s arrived at an answer and further questioning is no longer necessary, however.  That part&#39;s important too.  Not saying you don&#39;t know or do this, mind you.  Just saying questioning alone is nothing to necessarily hang one&#39;s hat upon.</p>

<p>It is a good thing to do in context, however.</p>

<p>And as inferior as belief certainly is to actually knowing, I have to admit that it&#39;s sometimes an inevitable step on the way <em>toward</em> knowing.  Therefore, and as such, we have to be careful not to <em>entirely</em> disavow that particular aspect of cognizance.  Stay away from <em>unnecessary</em> belief - yes - i.e. that belief which can ultimately be illuminated by actual knowledge.  However, also understand that there are some circumstances where, being the very limited, still developing, work-in-progress organisms that we are, complete and total knowledge of a thing might need to be temporarily eschewed while we accrue additional data from elsewhere.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The conspiracy is that r/conspiracy began looking at a lot of strange things that led from the email releases by Wikileaks. They did their usual treatment: &quot;Gray aliens abduct Hollywood actress and impregnates her.&quot; I mean, it&#39;s tabloid stuff. Everybody was ready and willing to blow it off as classic 4chan bullshit.</p>

<p>Next thing you know, NOBODY can talk about that abducted actress!</p>

<p>The conspiracy is this: Very strange and alarming claims emerge, which every sane person hopes are not factual in any way, and they are NEITHER refuted convincingly NOR ignored completely. They are made impossible to have any discussion about.</p>

<p>I am standing up and saying the obvious.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. When you have to say that sentence in a serious thread, something&#39;s seriously wrong. Nobody should ever be talking about killing Jews or anybody else. </p>

<p>Because I see so many threads that seem to intentionally make the discussion about anti-semite extremism, when there is no hint of that to start with. </p>

<p>It&#39;s like tainting the post so every normal person who doesn&#39;t even think about killing Jews feels terrible for having stumbled into your scary world.</p>

<p>That issue is the full-out response from deep state, controlled media, with an unprecedented, insane, never-before-seen level of propaganda and disinformation regarding that single, multi-faceted line of inquiry into how exactly the intended candidate for POTUS missed it, and we ended up with the guy who was built up in order to lose it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Frankly, think about how much people care about Mitt Romney. He was the last presidential nominee that failed. The answer is not many.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Instead they chose to react clumsily, unconvincingly, and to flat-out deny and censor it. Now they are doubling down in every direction. Why, why, why? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Beyond Clinton herself and a few of her close friends have you seen anyone or any media advocating for her to be president? Was there any recount besides Wisconsin(By state law a recount was mandatory due to less then 1% difference in vote)? Who keeps bringing up that illegal aliens cost him the popular vote? Who keeps handing out maps of all the states he won during the election? Who made the Election Fraud Commission?</p>

<p>There&#39;s something in common in my paragraph above. The real Elephant in the room is Trumpian propaganda to blame all the negative press he gets as an attempt of TPTB to elevate Clinton. You won&#39;t even get any Clinton love beyond she was better then Trump in <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>. Make her stand trail for her crimes, but stop using it as some TPTB excuse for Trump.</p>

<p>I&#39;m responding with my opinion that the reason you had little discussion is because of my points in my last post. No one besides Trump and his propaganda cares that she lost anymore. That propaganda is the real conspiracy and you&#39;re biting right into the apple.</p>

<p>That&#39;s hardly a ringing endorsement of the current POTUS. We all knew (except t_d diehards and even some of them) that Trump was just barely, a tiny bit, cleaner than Mrs C. He was a laughable candidate from the start. So how did he win? How did four blue-wall states turn? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Easy to answer that: real old-school &quot;the people&#39;s voice&quot; style protests have been infiltrated and turned into media propaganda events.</p>

<p>So a different form of protest is needed to say &quot;you cannot steal our resistance.&quot;</p>

<p>That&#39;s what these posts are about - the ability to have a voice in this particular forum without being subverted.</p>

<p>Sounds accurate to me. Only thing is: your post there has 3000+ points. That means you hit r/all. And r/all always brings in bad actors. The comments are a good example of the kind of thing you are talking about, but those commenters are not the same ones we have causing trouble throughout the rest of the sub. The invading brigaders who go into less upvoted topics are a different beast, even if their tactics frequently resemble those other jerks coming in from r/all. </p>
