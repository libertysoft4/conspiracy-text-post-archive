        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Remember the dude that predicted that Fresno Police would kill him, and was found dead stabbed in the abdomen with his house set ablaze. </p>

<p>Video of people outside his home: </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkktSQNP5-g&amp;feature=youtu.be">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkktSQNP5-g&amp;feature=youtu.be</a></p>

<p>His death was ruled a suicide by Fresno police.</p>

<p>Edit: This story never got the appropriate coverage because of the election, we should revisit this. He uploaded suspicious activity captured by his surveillance camera on his youtube channel:  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTMl9Ncxd-jhZ81s4z3XA6w/videos">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTMl9Ncxd-jhZ81s4z3XA6w/videos</a> .</p>

<p>I noticed a lot of people are uninformed so here&#39;s a background story:</p>

<p><a href="http://shockerfeed.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/johnlang.jpg">John Lang made a prediction days before his death and insisted if he died the Fresno police would be accountable on facebook.</a></p>

<p>He discovered a license plate scanning scam where Fresno police would scan license plates at retail store parking lots of lower income neighborhoods. After getting hits of violations they would pull the drivers over blocks away and claim they came upon their vehicle through routine driving patrols. He reported this illegal activity to Fresno Bee reporter. Since exposing the Fresno Law Enforcement, he noticed that he began to become a target and was being constantly stalked and harassed by Law Enforcement. He felt his chat logs were directed to Fresno Law Enforcement to garnish more information. His life threatenend, he filed an investigation to Internal Affairs, but was stonewalled and redirected to local law enforcement. After John&#39;s complaint to Internal Affairs PD, a large group of officers parked and stood outide his house doing nothing at 10PM<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UoCgiQwGBE">video</a>. He recorded diaries of Fresno police coming to his house and uploaded them to youtube. Frightened, he posted <a href="http://socialnewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Screen-Shot-2016-01-28-at-9.39.28-AM.png">this on facebook</a>
On 19th of January 2016, John Lang was discovered dead with stab wounds in his back and abdomen while his house was on fire. Fresno Police ruled it a suicide and no real investigation took place, and the fact that he predited his own death is concerning. This recieved little media attention, and it&#39;s time for some answers. </p>

<p>He kept a video diary, and this did not recieve the appriopiate attention because of the election. It&#39;s time we revisited it. </p>

<p>He said if he turned up missing or dead, remember this van: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5acGmgBGN8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5acGmgBGN8</a></p>

<p><a href="/u/Katayani108">/u/Katayani108</a> &#39;&#39;Did a bit of digging, and uncovered that Fresno Police Chief Jerry Dyer has an interesting past; from child rape to killing and framing their suicides&#39;&#39; - <a href="http://www.indybay.org/newsitems/2010/08/14/18656104.php">Source</a></p>

<p>I found it strange he received the promotion to Sergeant of Internal Affairs in 80s after he was investigated for statutory rape, which was never pursued by the Internal Affairs Unit in 2 separate investigations, even though Dyer admitted the &quot;mistake&quot; publicly. The same Internal Affairs that stonewalled Lang, and led to Police officers outside his home. For a bit more information on his character, here&#39;s a 10-minute video. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKbi50caYdg">Video</a></p>

In 2004, Dyer suspended Moralez for violating department policy, and took his badge and firearm from him. On November 9, 2004, Moralez went to Dyer&#39;s home to confront him.-- That was the last time anyone saw Jose Moralez&#39;&#39;</p>

<p>&#39;&#39;It was reported at the time that a motorist saw Jose face down, near a truck, with an alleged self-inflicting gunshot wound to his chest&#39;&#39;. His death was ruled a suicide, despite statement made by then City Manager, Daniel G. Hobbs, saying that &#39;&#39;not everyone believed Jose&#39;s death was a suicide&#39;&#39;. </p>

<p>My friend paid $300 for a partial autopsy to see whether the overdose was accidental or intentional. It took 4 months to receive the results, which were done by a private company that was recommended by the county. </p>

<p>(They found that her toxicology levels supported an accidental overdose, just enough dosage to be fatal, and there were no undigested pills present within her body. It brought my friend comfort knowing that her mother likely did not commit suicide.)</p>

<p>Since it&#39;s been shown it&#39;s possible to stab oneself repeatedly in order to commit suicide, what would another autopsy reveal? 
<a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/teenager-stabs-death-onstage-open-mic-night-front-shocked-crowd-coffee-shop-article-1.116121">http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/teenager-stabs-death-onstage-open-mic-night-front-shocked-crowd-coffee-shop-article-1.116121</a></p>

<p>We know there are people who do self harm, because of mental issues, and to also kill themselves as martyrs, so why is it strange to think that someone would predict their death and make it a self fulfilling prophesy?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because Seth Rich is a disgustingly politicized tragedy that is representative of how desperate the alt-right has become for credibility. I know conspiracy doctrine automatically dictates &quot;there are no coincidences&quot;, but the fact that Seth&#39;s parents have to go and tell the internet to stop politicizing their son&#39;s murder, the fact that only right-wing scumbags are pushing the narrative, the fact that T_D and co. keep referring to it as an &quot;investigation&quot; when they are doing everything but investigating it - it just gets ridiculous, and sickening. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, this man has concrete proof that the Fresno PD conspired against him, carefully documented the entire ordeal, and was still squashed like a bug by these pigs? And everyone stays silent, because it doesn&#39;t serve a political agenda? This is what conspiracies are, what we should be investigating. This is the shit that needs to be uncovered, not something that will serve to further some ulterior motive. Things like this need to see the brightest light of day because it&#39;s the right thing to do. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I think <a href="/u/Elkinorino">/u/Elkinorino</a> has a strong point, but oyu have to look at it in another way.</p>

<p>You have a case with intense documentation that should be fairly easy to follow up on and lock down the people responsible. There&#39;s easily discernible faces on that first video and a history that&#39;s easy to follow. It&#39;s all but ignored. </p>

<p>You have another case that doesn&#39;t have close to the same amount of documentation, just lots of words on the internet and guesstimates. However, it gets a hell of a lot more attention and is still ongoing in a lot of ways.</p>

<p>In a vacuum, it doesn&#39;t make any sense. Why wouldn&#39;t you pursue the case with far more hard evidence? The key difference is that Lang&#39;s death isn&#39;t as consequential as Rich&#39;s death, in terms of national impact and awareness. It&#39;s possible that something huge could come form solving Lang&#39;s murder, but we <em>know</em> something massive would come from solving Rich&#39;s murder. </p>

<p>That&#39;s how I see this, anyway.</p>

I understand the easier kneejerk reaction is to deny their existence because is scary... But if you believe we live on a globe and all the stars we can see are real then you better believe that Reptilians could be real. You should make a post debunking Reptilians if you&#39;re so sure.

    <div class="md"><h2>1561 celestial phenomenon over Nuremberg</h2>

<p>The 1561 celestial phenomenon over Nuremberg was a mass sighting of celestial phenomena or unidentified flying objects (UFO) above Nuremberg, Germany. The phenomenon has been interpreted by some modern UFO enthusiasts as an aerial battle, possibly of extraterrestrial origin. This view is mostly dismissed by skeptics, some referencing Carl Jung&#39;s mid-twentieth century writings about the subject while others find the phenomenon is likely to be a Sun Dog.</p>

To be honest with you, I didn&#39;t know what a &#39;conspiracy theory&#39; even was until after I finished the book and the only reason I picked it up was cuz it thought it&#39;d help me somehow with the whole &#39;spiritual Ascension&#39; thing. The former chapters seemed quite deep and relatable as I skimmed through. I&#39;d only just started reading books on ESP and the super human feats by those Indian Yogis started making more sense the more I delved into Icke&#39;s book. Finally I decided to borrow it from the school&#39;s library ( I&#39;m probably the first to have borrowed and actually read the whole thing ). 
This was two years ago. I&#39;m graduating high school soon.
I live in a Hindu community and Icke&#39;s book made it pretty clear as to why there are countless references to Serpent Gods (Nagas) in many Hindu scriptures as well as to the nature of other dimensional realms. </p>

Maybe aliens that happen to be reptilian-esque, but at that point it has the same amount of evidence as any other type of alien, and less than the &#39;greyling&#39; variety.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen that 3 hour interview. I remember him talking about aliens, which I think there is reasonable evidence for. Thin grey aliens are a recurring theme for a reason. There is exactly as much evidence for what he is saying as there is for Xenu and scientology: no physical evidence. The burden of proof is on the person making the claim. </p>

<p>I never said they do not exist, way to jump to conclusions, I bet you&#39;ve won many trophies for that. They may or may not exist. There is no physical evidence that they do. Not a single body, piece of DNA, photograph, video, or anything else. </p>

<p>L. Ron Hubbard did the same thing.</p>

<p>Again the burden of proof lies on the one making the positive claim. </p>

<p>There is a lot of evidence that NASA doctored footage. They probably did go to the moon, samples of moon dust exist that could not have originated on earth due to their isotopic composition. Whether somebody walked on its surface is another question. As is, whats the point of going to the moon?</p>

They both have the same amount of evidence SUPPORTING them. So I could literally make up a theory right now...

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;I am being targeted by multiple City of Fresno departments and the Fresno Sheriff&#39;s Office for comments I made on the Fresno Bee from 2009 to 2013. Comments that were critical of the way Fresno PD and Fresno Fire utilized their budgets. My Disqus handle during that time was &quot;John21&quot;. Posters on the Fresno Bee, using the then Disqus comment system were suppose to be anonymous. However, Fresno Bee employee Jody Murray shared Fresno Bee log data and ip address information with Jared L McCormick, a Fresno Sheriff Sergeant, who then used the Fresno Bee provided information to retrieve name and address information in order to maliciously track-down, stalk, and harass Fresno Bee comment posters, including myself. </p>

<p>McCormick&#39;s Disqus handle on the Bee was &quot;Hikerdude1967&quot;. I notified Jim Boren, the then Fresno Bee Editor via email on two occasions in 2013 regarding an employee at the Bee who was sharing website ip and log data of Fresno Bee commenters with Fresno PD and Fresno Sheriff personnel. I explained in these emails that as a result of Jody Murray&#39;s nefarious efforts Fresno Bee commenters were subsequently stalked and harassed by Fresno Law Enforcement. I never received a reply from from Mr. Boren on either occasion. However, consequently, I have been made a constant target of harassment, intimidation, and worse by multiple City of Fresno Departments and the Fresno Sheriff&#39;s office.&quot;</p>

<p>His situation took my comment to the extreme.</p>

<p>It&#39;s called the mainstream ban, only select comments they agree with and only further their agendas are approved. Comments go through what&#39;s called the &quot;truth gauntlet&quot; where it gets poked and prodded, stripped of anything thought proving, and finally monetized, limping out of the gauntlet whimpers the &quot;mainstream truth&quot;.</p>

<p>At approximately 8:30 Pm on 4/11/2015 George and Maxine Ramirez, my neighbors, invite me over to their house. After an hour and a half or so I start to get unexpectedly uncomfortable.  Quickly, I stand up from sitting on the couch and explain I need to leave because I believe I&#39;ve lost my wallet.  As I walk toward the door Maxine Ramirez immediately blocks my path to the front door and puts her hands up and says “no you can&#39;t leave, just sit down”.</p>

<p>Police corruption is a real thing, and it is precisely because the oversight is inadequate and has a conflict of interest. Thats not really a controversial opinion anywhere, except maybe within a police department.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hahahaha, ok so a wiki page on NYPD cases proves that the fresno, CA police are corrupt and probably killed John Lang and justifies having +2300 upvote thread with people circle jerking about it. Got it.</p>

<p>Honestly a 4Chan infographic probably would have helped your case more.</p>

<p>Anyways, see you around. I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll be really busy collecting <em>actual evidence</em> that this murder occurred rather than circle jerking about police corruption on conspiracy</p>

<p>People keep holding to the idea that there was a time when everything was peachy and mankind lived in harmony, and that time was in the recent past.  This isn&#39;t admonishing you in any way, just to be clear, but I want to say the authorities being corrupt goes back a very long way.  There have always been both good and bad people among the ranks of those that enforce the law on the populace, with some helping and some hurting those under their care.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Problem is that while it&#39;s obviously false that there was ever a time when corruption wasn&#39;t an issue, it doesn&#39;t matter. What matters is that the issue has been given light, and people can&#39;t refuse to see the issue without being absolutely willfully ignorant of it now. </p>

<p>The people who want to say stupid things like &quot;most cops are good&quot; aren&#39;t looking at the issue wanting all cops to be the good guy. They know that only a few of the actions of police ever reach major acknowledgement. They know that when one cop breaks the law, those around that cop typically become accomplices and commit perjury. They know that police investigate police, meaning the entire situation is compromised by a conflict of interest in it&#39;s very best of situations, and blatantly corrupt in others. </p>

<p>Does this mean every last cop is some evil villian waiting around the corner to do something criminal in nature? Nope. It does mean that most cops have lost respect for the law and for the communities they police, along with most of their empathy for fellow humans. This is a procedural, systemic, cultural, and societal problem that needs to be dealt with. That lack of accountability that police enjoy will come back to bite them, and it won&#39;t be good for police, or for society. It would be better for everyone in the long run to get cops under control.</p>

<p>I know not all police are like this, but the majority do seem a lot more caring than the US that I&#39;ve seen. But once money is involved everyones attitude can be swayed.</p>

<p>To be fair, I&#39;d imagine it&#39;s a lot better being a cop in the UK than in some of the high crime areas in the US. How much do cops in the UK make?</p>

<p>yeah for sure, knowing that anybody you approach; in almost any situation, could have a gun would be enough to have you constantly on edge...</p>

<p>as for wage</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The starting salary for police constables in England, Wales and Northern Ireland is between £19,383 and £22,962, rising to £37,254 at the top of the scale - achievable after about seven years. In Scotland it&#39;s slightly higher, starting at £23,493 and rising to £36,885 - achievable after about ten years.</p>

The heat is certainly on and while this seems slam dunk, I can see this pulling attention away from DNC lawsuit, Seth Ritch, MSM bullshit propaganda, and Russian fake intervention.  Again, I was not aware of this specific case and certainly see the validity of it being placed on conspiracy.  I never comment, simply read and observe.  If this story gains traction, I see national attention on Fresno police.  It really seems slam dunk.  All due respect to John Lang.</p>

Seth Rich was a hero, and so was John Lang who was an activist fighting corruption in the Fresno police department. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Fresno Police Department is one of the most corrupt agencies in the USA. </p>

<p>There is a well documented case of a Mexican immigrant who was used by the Fresno Police Department so sell ilegal drugs that they confiscated from drug cartels.  This Mexican sued  the following police officers from Fresno: Pedro Santillan, Epifanio Cardenas, Raymundo Camacho, John Galvan, Vicki Munoz, M. Vincen and detectives  Jerado Chamalbide and Matthew Schiotis. 
Source: <a href="http://caselaw.findlaw.com/ca-court-of-appeal/1552753.html">http://caselaw.findlaw.com/ca-court-of-appeal/1552753.html</a> </p>

<p>Supported by the DEA, Fresno policemen force illegal immigrants to sell drugs. Nothing is being done to stop this. A journalist friend wrote a book about this case in Spanish, an academic from UC at Davis translated this book to publish it in the USA and it was rejected by the University. I wonder why. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The entire police culture is rotten to the core. There is, imo and without a doubt, no other government arm more corrupt in this country than the conbined US police force.</p>

<p>It shocks me that this arm of the government is seemingly above reproach and that all criticism of it immediately brands you as a bad person. No other fucking government agent is treated like they are. You cannot question them. You cannot demand they comply with basic accountability and transparency. Nothing. Anything you demand of them immediately brands you as a cop-hating son-of-a-bitch and dismissed.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, these fucks can run drugs, rape, pimp, launder money, steal, extort, harass, beat and even murder with virtual impunity.</p>

<p>... and the most frightening thing about all this is that instead of the populace waking up and demanding more accountability, the police have exploited the political winds and have merged themselves into the political battleground so that, they too, can be auto-defended by so and so political side. </p>

<p>That scares the shit out of me. Instead of people doing something about it, they draw political battle lines and the issue becomes another red vs blue auto-defend topic. </p>

<p>Shit is getting real scary out here. Smh</p>

</blockquote>

<p>This is a problem with politicizing things that should be bipartisan. BLM has a legit cause, but they have done more to get people to support police than any police propaganda could achieve. It&#39;s been a complete failure as a movement, and it hasn&#39;t been helped by BLM leaders shifting focus to other politicized causes, because now people are conflating their views on police with issues like affirmative action and feminism, which muddies the issue. </p>

<p>The other thing is that, as this case shows, abuse by police often times has nothing to do with race. John Lang is white (or maybe asian?) and the police chief of Fresno is black. But BLM has created the impression that police are on the side of white people and only abuse black men. If Lang was black, this case would be getting more news coverage, but this story doesn&#39;t fit the current narrative. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here was a highly-upvoted comment in r/news from a year ago, detailing a similar experience to what John Lang had:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/4c41v2/man_thrown_in_jail_and_faces_felony_charge_for/d1f07qd/">https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/4c41v2/man_thrown_in_jail_and_faces_felony_charge_for/d1f07qd/</a></p>

<p>It&#39;s called organized stalking, and the intention is for the subject to commit suicide. It plays a large role in the U.S.&#39;s rising mortality rates (including suicides and drug overdoses).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Careful what you say online. People in the wrong places took note of what he was saying and they took extreme measures to shut him up. That only happens when big money is involved - chances are some heads would roll if whatever Lang was onto came to light and the media took notice. It really is a shame there has been no federal investigation into his death. There are corrupt people in positions of power in Fresno that much seems to be certain - makes you wonder if that corruption extends to the nearby federal field offices or if a few hands have been greased along the way to make this go away. The people who orchestrated this werent even subtle about it either - look at the camera rig they had in the van - that&#39;s state of the art, top dollar equipment. Petty house thieves aren&#39;t going to have access to such technology. I am amazed they went through such lengths to shut this guy up (the expensive camera in the van was this biggest give-away that this was a professional operation). Killed by stabbing, house set on fire, yet still ruled a suicide. </p>

<p>The Police Chief seems like the best angle to pursue here. You can&#39;t ignore his history and you can bet he&#39;s hired plenty of corrupt cops in his time. I&#39;d bet the ticketing scheme was just the tip of the iceberg with the Fresno PD.</p>
