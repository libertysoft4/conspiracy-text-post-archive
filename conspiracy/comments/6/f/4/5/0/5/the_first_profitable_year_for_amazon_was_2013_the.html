        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">605</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2017-06-03 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/timo1200.html">timo1200</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>To put that another way, Bezos used less than half the money he got from the CIA to buy the Washington Post.</p>

<p>Do you think that was a sweetheart deal?</p>

<p>I do. And like others, I believe it’s something Americans should know about. For instance, the Washington Post often quotes unnamed CIA sources in its reporting. Yet, the Post doesn’t disclose that the CIA paid the owner of the paper more than twice what it cost to buy it. You won’t find any mention of this deal on the Washington Post’s Wikipedia page, either. Not worth mentioning, apparently.</p>

<p>Now I want you to imagine the CIA contracting with WND.com for, say, a measly $600,000. How do you suppose that would be covered by the Washington Post? How would it be chronicled in Wikipedia? Do you think I’d get a pass? I think not.</p>

<p>Who was CIA director when this deal with the Washington Post was finalized?</p>

<p>John Brennan.</p>

<p>You remember John Brennan? He’s the former CIA director, named by Barack Obama, who testified to Congress in March that Russia “brazenly interfered” in U.S. elections, including actively contacting members of Donald Trump’s campaign – but he stopped shy of dubbing it “collusion.”</p>

<p>“I saw interaction that in my mind raised questions of whether it was collusion,” Brennan told Rep. Trey Gowdy, saying that he supported the FBI digging further. “It was necessary to pull threads.”</p>

<p>It was Brennan, a good friend of Obama’s, who said he believed the contacts were numerous enough to alert the FBI, which began its probe into Trump associates that same July, according to previous congressional testimony from then-FBI Director James B. Comey. Brennan has been a loyal progressive Democrat since he voted for the Communist Party presidential candidate in 1976.</p>

<p>The Washington Post has been on the Russian-Trump story like white on rice ever since – along with the New York Times, CNN, ABC News, CBS News, NBC News and the rest of the pack of jackals. This investigation has been going on since 2016, yet no evidence has been found to support the “collusion.”</p>

<p>Wouldn’t you like to see an investigation into the collusion between John Brennan, Jeff Bezos, Amazon, the Washington Post and the CIA?</p>

<p>I sure would.</p>

<p>After all, they were all involved in an actual monetary deal that could have profound implications for the future of America, American business and American journalism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just to play Devil&#39;s Advocate, this could also be because database/server hosting (AWS) is a pretty solid industry that has been around for years and doesn&#39;t require a ton of manpower to manage. Whereas Alexa and AI/personal assistant stuff is still somewhat new it makes sense they would be devoting a lot more manpower to this department.</p>

<p>That being said, the CIA connection and the thing in March are very concerning.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Based on what I&#39;ve seen in telecom, I think that there&#39;s been mass surveillance for quite a while. But the KEY to all the mass surveillance is that it&#39;s always been done by third parties.</p>

<p>For instance, fifteen years ago there was a case where a foreign software company was accused of spying : <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/2005/06/01/israeli-companies-spying-on-us-tech-firms.html">http://www.foxnews.com/story/2005/06/01/israeli-companies-spying-on-us-tech-firms.html</a></p>

<p>If you put the pieces together, you can see that Amazon has a lot of valuable data there. So it&#39;s not the NSA or the CIA spying on people directly; everything is done by third parties, so the agencies have plausible deniability that they didn&#39;t violate anyone&#39;s constitutional rights. The end result is the same, it&#39;s still spying, but it&#39;s a way of doing it that no one goes to prison.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, to think that they didn&#39;t actually have profits is laughable. It was well known that Bezos was keeping actual profits and the growth of AWS close to his chest because he didn&#39;t want to tip off Amazon&#39;s rivals. They were also heavily investing in the Fire phone and other things that they could count as a capital expenditure and hence post a net loss.</p>

<p>To think that they only got profits because of a paltry $600m contract from the CIA is naive.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have no idea how businesses work, there are a score of Fortune 500 companies that declared losses over $1 *<em>billion</em> last year. And with tech companies it&#39;s normal to have losses as they aggressively grow and reinvest.</p>

<p>I can have some fun with the CIA stuff too.</p>

<p>Jeff Bezos is the second richest man in the world. Amazon Web Services getting a $600m contract with the CIA (that&#39;s revenue over ten years) is nothing to him, hell it&#39;s nothing to AWS, and it&#39;s not like he even owns all of Amazon, he has 16.9%.</p>

<p>But let&#39;s play your game and pretend that the CIA gave Amazon $600m upfront, they didn&#39;t actually have to provide any service over the course of a decade. Bezos share is a cool $101.4m.</p>

<p>Of course it&#39;s nothing like that in reality because that&#39;s his share of the company, but we&#39;re playing OPs game. So let&#39;s instead say the CIA gave him $101.4m cash monies, not so impressive when today you&#39;re worth over 800 times that, but why turn your nose down at it?</p>

<p>Now he has to spend $250m to buy the WaPo, whut?</p>

<p>The CIA really stuffed him there, I suppose he has to pay all the ongoing costs and figure out how to have them control the WaPo too? You don&#39;t offer any suggestions for us.</p>

<p>Could it be that OP, who comes from T_D as a diehard messenger of Trump propaganda, is trying to discredit the WaPo with a pretty weak conspiracy?</p>

<p>They do mention that the &quot;New York Times, CNN, ABC News, CBS News, NBC News&quot; have bene running the same kinds of stories. Does this credit the conspiracy and mean that the CIA are paying shitty bribes to the owners of all those media companies? Or does it mean the WaPo is acting no differently to media companies owned by someone who isn&#39;t CEO and shareholder in a company where the CIA aren&#39;t even a top 100 customer of a subsidiary?</p>

<p>Btw who do the CIA buy their office supplies from?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No one said it was proof. OP stated facts and then went on to say what he believes based on those facts.</p>

<p>You didn&#39;t break anything down or show that anything didn&#39;t add up. Here are your &quot;points&quot;:</p>

<p>1) This deal would have been bad for Jeff bezos because he had to spend more money than he would have made.</p>

<p>This point is hilariously dumb because he BOUGHT A BUSINESS. It&#39;s not like the money disappeared. He bought something that will continue to earn money. And not just any business but a very important business for a businessman. There is a reason rich people and connected corporations own all the top news agencies--because it allows them to control the flow of information. If you are a businessman that is insanely important, especially if you are a sleazy one who might benefit from people being distracted from your dirty dealings.</p>

<p>Not to mention he very likely would receive other benefits and connections for making this deal. Being at the top is all about networking. Even if he was at a loss for this, which he isn&#39;t, he would almost certainly benefit in many other ways just for doing it.</p>

<p>On top of all that there is still the simple fact that they received this money. At the very least we know that they were contracted to do <em>something.</em> That alone leaves the door open for speculation and that ties into the fact that he owns a major news outlet.</p>

<p>2) Your second point is that OP comes from T_D. </p>

<p>That&#39;s not an argument. He may be inclined to push beliefs in support of trump, that is true, but it has nothing to do with his actual belief. If you want to refute it then make an argument against what he said. You failed to do that.</p>

<p>Or we can look at your account and see you&#39;re only 10 days old and everything you say is to distract from posts against official narratives and talk down on the sub and community on the whole if you want to play that game.</p>

<p>3) You make the point that other news agencies act in similar ways.</p>

<p>This is also a terrible point. All of these agencies are owned by powerful people. This post is focusing on WaPo but they are not being singled out. All the major news agencies act in similar ways because they are all in on it to varying degrees. For decades the news in this country has been controlled. We know that for a fact they more directly integrated with our government and there has been no indication that it stopped. WaPo seems the same as these other companies because they are the same--just not in the way you are suggesting.</p>

<p>Again, you didn&#39;t make a valid argument. </p>

The CIA contract with AWS was for 600 million over 10 years, meaning the yearly contribution towards Amazons annual revenues is a rounding error. That money does not go straight to Jeff Bezos&#39; pocket, he gets cash by liquidating stock or taking salary+bonus.</p>

<p>One thing that spooks me is that most of these guys got ahead when the economy was complete shit. For instance, the economy in Seattle was completely cratered after the dot-com crash, and Amazon wouldn&#39;t be what it is today if it wasn&#39;t for thousands of unemployed techies in Seattle during 2000-2005. (Can confirm: I was one of them)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s quite a mixed bag. Fair enough Amazon, they have a real business going and started to build a cash reserve and declare a profit. But there are others that are fizzling out all ready along with all the crazy valuations and bad IPOs. I suppose more companies are private than in the dot-com era, the markets were the biggest issue then. Today there’s real money being invested into these startups directly, and real applications. It’s more a valuation problem in my mind. If you build some sweet tech someone might buy you but the price might be way too high, and if you’re providing a service but don’t have a way to monetise it? Hmm..</p>

<p>Dunno if we’l see a crash, or just a series of smaller ‘corrections’ (such a good euphemism).</p>

<p>The crash in Y2K freed up a lot of talent, and that talent went on to build Amazon and Google</p>

<p>The crash in 2008 freed up talent that worked on Facebook</p>

<p>The economy can&#39;t continue to run at this pace; the current expansion is unsustainable</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>The government was spending more money on information technology within the IC than ever before. IT spending reached $8 billion in 2013, according to budget documents leaked by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden. The CIA and other agencies feasibly could have spent billions of dollars standing up their own cloud infrastructure without raising many eyebrows in Congress, but the decision to purchase a single commercial solution came down primarily to two factors.</p>

<p>“What we were really looking at was time to mission and innovation,” the former intelligence official said. “The goal was, ‘Can we act like a large enterprise in the corporate world and buy the thing that we don’t have, can we catch up to the commercial cycle? Anybody can build a data center, but could we purchase something more?</p>

<p>“We decided we needed to buy innovation,” the former intelligence official said.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A nice, long, interesting article. Please take a read:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/07/the-details-about-the-cias-deal-with-amazon/374632/">https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/07/the-details-about-the-cias-deal-with-amazon/374632/</a></p>

<p>Did you know the GAO ethics branch of the government was involved in this deal?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A month after the deal became public, IBM filed a bid protest with GAO that the watchdog eventually upheld in June, forcing the CIA to reopen bids to both companies for the contract. A legal struggle between Amazon and Big Blue ensued, and AWS filed a lawsuit against the federal government in July 2013, claiming the GAO sustainment was a “flawed” decision. </p>

<p>In October, U.S. Court of Federal Claims Judge Thomas Wheeler sided with Amazon and overturned GAO’s decision to force the CIA to rebid the contract. Big Blue went home, AWS claimed victory under the deal’s original financial specs, and nearly 18 months after the procurement was first released, the CIA and Amazon went to work.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You think IBM would&#39;ve kept quiet if more nefarious things were going on?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Amazon-built cloud will operate behind the IC’s firewall, or more simply: It’s a public cloud built on private premises. </p>
</blockquote>

<h2></h2>

<blockquote>
<p>[...] Intelligence agencies will be able to host applications or order a variety of on-demand services like storage, computing and analytics. True to the National Institute of Standards and Technology definition of cloud computing, the IC cloud scales up or down to meet the need. </p>

<p>In that regard, customers will pay only for services they actually use, which is expected to generate massive savings for the IC.</p>

<p>“We see this as a tremendous opportunity to sharpen our focus and to be very efficient,” Wolfe told an audience at AWS’ annual nonprofit and government symposium in Washington. “We hope to get speed and scale out of the cloud, and a tremendous amount of efficiency in terms of folks traditionally using IT now using it in a cost-recovery way.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s how reinvesting to grow your business works.</p>

<p>Imagine if you ran an infinitely large warehouse. Rather than pocketing the profits over your means to live, you just use it to by more goods to sell. You don&#39;t pay taxes (by the Fed, state sales tax still happens on each sale) on the money you spent on cost of goods.</p>

<p>So if you just keep rolling your profits back in and fill your tax free investment vehicles, you&#39;ll minimize the amount of tax you pay and still massively grow your business. This is the basic idea that most startup business owners use to get going. Just repeated reinvesting. Amazon did it longer than most businesses (running in the red), and it seems to have worked out well for them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/CasinoReality117">CasinoReality</a> paying as few taxes as you are legally responsible for can be accomplished by anyone (non corrupt small business) with proper tax planning.  </p>

<p>The first area most business&#39;s reduce their tax burdens is with deductions.  Every dollar a business spends, gets spent before any taxes are removed.  They are allowed to deduct their expenses and only pay a small percentage of taxes on those expenses.  The government allows you to deduct things like business miles at 54 cents a mile.  Drive 10,000 business miles and that&#39;s a $5,400 deduction.  </p>

<p>Business&#39;s can also deduct things like restaurants, hotels, and other travel costs.   They can also carryover losses from prior (things like startup costs) years.  </p>

<p>There are lot&#39;s more advantages and strategies for reducing your tax burden.   A good accountant can save you a huge pile of cash.<br/>
The &quot;corrupt&quot; business&#39;s we hear who paid little or no taxes, are almost always lies.  These companies are likely not corrupt.  They might not pay lets say any Federal taxes, they are paying millions in other taxes.  Taxes such as employee, social security, medicare, sales taxes, property taxes, state &amp; local.  Those reports are fake news. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve rambled on enough.  Sure it&#39;s not ELI5 quality, but hopefully it gives some insight.  Any questions let me know.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>While Bezos is definitely a sketchy dude and I don&#39;t trust his as far as I can throw him, this type of thing isn&#39;t uncommon. A company like Amazon has massive overhead costs associated with doing business meaning they had to invest a ton of money and resources just to get it functioning properly. This means a number of years of posting losses until they eventually get infrastructure in place and can start turning a profit.</p>
