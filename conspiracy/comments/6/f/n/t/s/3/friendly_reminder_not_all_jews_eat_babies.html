        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hi all,
I am a mid thirties man of Jewish descent who lives in America.  I don&#39;t practice Judaism but I do respect my roots.  I love a good conspiracy.  I often come here as soon as a &quot;terror&quot; event happens looking for signs of a false flag.  I believe there is waaaay more to 9-11 than what was reported in the MSM.  I am open and lean towards a belief that there is life on other planets and that our government has proof of it.  I see chemtrails often and wonder what they are spraying.  I believe Israel and the U.S. have conniving/dirty governments and are involved in lots of shady endeavors.  I probably stop short of a lot of you do with some conspiracies, not because I don&#39;t believe in them, but more so because I believe many of them are impossible to prove and notice that my quality of life drops considerably if I get too invested.
I don&#39;t judge anyone for going deep though, I appreciate it.</p>

<p>What prompted me to write this is mixed in with all the juicy conspiracy on this sub is hate speech directed towards Jews.  Talking about how we are &quot;leeches&quot; &quot;baby-eaters&quot; and about how we &quot;control&quot; everything.  Let me be clear I know a lot of Jews who hold all kinds of jobs throughout the states and throughout the world.  We don&#39;t control shit.  Am I saying there aren&#39;t powerful groups of Jews who are in charge of banks and have other holdings?  No.  Sure there probably are just like there are groups of Christians and Muslims.  Maybe the Jewish groups are more insidious.  But I for one don&#39;t have any more connection to those people than I do to Donald Trump or Ariana Grande or Montgomery Burns.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m sure there are some of you out there who just hate all Jews, me included.  And that sucks, but it is what it is.  Who I&#39;m trying to address here is the people who have problems with groups of Jews but maybe are on the fence about individuals.  To you I say, if you can be more specific in your language we can actually be allies.  Thanks for your time.</p>

<p>EDIT:  Thank you for all of your comments that contributed to a stimulating conversation.  I apologize for not being crystal clear in my original post.  I gained more clarity as it went on and believe my basic question could be summed up as: I am of Jewish descent, based on that alone does this community have a problem with me?<br/>
The answers I received varied from:  no (mostly got this one), to I don&#39;t care, to yes, to no but you have a heightened responsibility.  I appreciate all of those as well as all of the other talking points.  I particularly appreciate this comment: &quot; I would bet most here dont think that DNA makes you evil,&quot;  as I haven&#39;t always felt that way, but now I do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You see though, how any collectivist term is usually bad for the discussion? Personally i&#39;m not very caring of anyone&#39;s safe space sensibilities, but im concerned the the more we throw these labels around, the easier it becomes to shift the blame and sway the discussion. &quot;The americans are bombing x&quot; holds no one accountable, while &quot;NATO forces from 19th Air Support Squadron are bombing x&quot; might. Yes this is a dumb example, but speaking in particular terms whenever possible seems a lot more helpful than tossing out blanket statements and not batting an eye. And i also say this because getting us to label eachother has been a longstanding tactic in their game of divide and conquer against humanity. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, in the same way I see the issue with writing a post claiming &quot;hate speech&quot; while citing no specific examples of it, and forcing conversation like this one, perpetuated in vague generalizations about some phantom of &quot;anti-Semitism&quot; that the OP simply insists the existence of a priori.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Perhaps we could benefit still. Use these discussions to shine a spotlight on this societal meme. Why do entire subject matters of historical and cultural importance become taboo under the threat &quot;antisemitism&quot;? Why do westerners fear that word compulsively? Why do they perceive it as being far more serious than garden variety racism? 
Personally i find this thread interesting because most jews i know are very ignorant of the bigger picture, and even the &quot;woke&quot; ones seem incredibly reticent to discussing the failings of jewry with a goy :l must be some form of cultural mind control, where the collective is to be protected at all costs, even if they themselves must suffer in silence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do think it&#39;s an interesting discussion, even if I take issue with the way OP framed it. I think the Jewish press, which has maintained power in the West, particularly America, for well over a century, not to mention the American entertainment industry, has controlled the narrative to such a degree that the special status of &quot;anti-Semitism&quot; as an extreme form of racism has become cemented as an off limits stigma in Western culture. The very direct political confrontation of the Jewish question by the NSDAP, and the subsequent political exploitation of the situation by the Jewish press, made the Western goyim all the more receptive to the conditioning.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah. Jews have been pretty much babied on the world stage since ww2, and are increasingly taught that anything can be construed as an attack on all jewry. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if some of the &quot;real&quot; antisemites are planted by the controlling jews themselves in order to more easily coopt the rest of the normal jewish populations into supporting zionism... a &quot;phantom of antisemitism&quot; indeed.

This isnt due to any sort of genetic superiority, but because the religion itself allows for deception for economic gain.</p>

Moreover, the &quot;synagogue of satan&quot; that usurps your name and kills your people should see more resistance from real jews and less complicity from within... Tell me, what do you think about the political zionism that pervades western media? How do you feel being protected by the weaponized &quot;mainstream public opinion&quot; on one side, all but untouchable to the cry of &quot;antisemitism!&quot;, while on the flipside, the rest of the world seems to openly hate you for all the crimes committed in your name? </p>

<p>i may be missing something, but judaism and christianity are almost the same religion, barring the new testament part? so then does not also the Christian religion allow for deception for economic gain? yet such analysis on christians rarely appears here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Facts that cannot be denied:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Jewish over-representation in the Bolshevik revolution</p></li>
<li><p>Jewish over-representation in the news media in present day America</p></li>
<li><p>Jewish over-representation in the central banking system in present day America and most of the western world</p></li>
<li><p>Jewish over-representation in the entertainment media including adult entertainment such as pornography</p></li>
<li><p>Jewish over-representation in the above three areas in Germany prior to 1933</p></li>
<li><p>Jewish involvement in events surrounding the 9/11 atrocity</p></li>
<li><p>The massive control of the &quot;Israel lobby&quot; over American political interests, and foreign policy</p></li>
<li><p>Jewish over-representation in the top billionaires of the US</p></li>
<li><p>The constant human rights violations committed wantonly by the state of Israel, but virtually unaccounted for</p></li>
<li><p>The expanse of Israeli borders contrary to the Geneva convention</p></li>
<li><p>The intentional attack on the USS Liberty by the Israeli military, killing dozens of American soldiers</p></li>
</ul>

<p>-The implementation of and strict enforcement of &quot;anti-Semitism&quot; laws, of which the effect is to stifle debate about this subject</p>

<p>If the above facts cannot be discussed, as it appears u/Avocado111 would have, then I have a problem. I have no animus towards any individual, Jew or gentile, if they haven&#39;t themselves done something worthy of derision. But I&#39;ll be damned if I&#39;m going to allow the quest for truth to be obfuscated in the interest of political correctness, if only someone perceives my skepticism of Jews as a group as something other than healthy distrust based on substantiated evidence of the group&#39;s historical record.</p>

<p>Not all Jews who are up to no good are dedicated &quot;Zionists.&quot; I&#39;m still not sure which comments you are referring to, but if, for example, I state that &quot;the Jews&quot; overwhelmingly control the information disseminated in the press, you can assume I&#39;m talking about the Jews that are influential in the press, who may or may not be Zionists.

<p>Here&#39;s something that might appease your mind (or not)... I believe most of the anger towards jews coming from here when talking about TPTB is that a lot of them are jewish.. But like all religions there&#39;s different branches and stuff like that (I&#39;m no expert). Well most of them have roots in Talmudic Zionism apparently, which would make sense considering the sickos they are lol. Bonus fun fact: Wahhabism was created when a talmudic zionist &quot;converted&quot; to islam. Basically made the same shit but around islam. And now we have ISIS</p>

<p>Data is data, your conclusion is retarded, because it still supports the narrative. <a href="https://thezog.wordpress.com/who-controls-the-federal-reserve-system-part-1/">Here</a> you have an example of a bit of outdated data, more specific: The Chairman of the FED, it&#39;s not Ben Shalom Bernanke anymore, an Ashkenazi Jew, now it&#39;s Janet Yellen, an Ashkenazi Jew. Who&#39;s the Vice Chairman now? Stanley Fischer, another Jew. The People may change, but the Jew stays. They are way overrepresented, you can check the data yourself if you don&#39;t want to believe what&#39;s on the list, I&#39;d be interested in your findings if you find out that Jews don&#39;t run most of what is on that list, I&#39;ll give you reddit gold, buy you a beer, whatever, I&#39;m 100% sure you can&#39;t refute the evidence, so try it and very good luck you goyishe kop!</p>

<p>Perhaps you should read the rest of his paragraph then. I&#39;m not saying he believes everyone hates all Jews, I&#39;m saying he&#39;s directing this at r/conspiracy specifically because he obviously feels that he saw some extreme anti-semitism and he&#39;s making it sound like it happens fairly often here.

    <div class="md"><p>This is a copy pasta from a post I made about a month ago on antisemitism... I hope it contributes to this topic.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I am pretty sure it [antisemitism] is a trap for people who get close to the truth. There was an effort during the election to brand anti-globalism as a code for anti-semitism. I think that is a REALLY big hint.</p>

<p>The concept of everything being the fault of &quot;the jews&quot; is intentionally reductive, because such simplified ideas are naturally appealing. This serves well to catch anyone going down the rabbit hole in a sort of gravity well that will get them branded a racist/nazi/antisemitite.
The Truth is that there are a subset of people, some of which are jewish, who control a ridiculous number of very important industries and hold a great deal of political and financial control. They aren&#39;t exclusively jewish though, but there are enough that you can point to it as a trend and people will go in that direction.</p>

<p>There is a massive difference between the little old lady who lives down the road and Mossad. Yet you see that anyone who is critical of Israel&#39;s influence on domestic or global politics, on either side of the political aisle, get branded with the antisemitic label.</p>

<p>Are you Critical of Israel&#39;s treatment of Palestinians? ANTISEMITE!</p>

<p>Are you wary of the influence that global bankers and hedge fund managers hold over our politicians? ANTISEMITE!</p>

<p>Ever notice that nepotism runs rampant in the media and in Hollywood? ANTISEMITE</p>

<p>Have you ever asked the wrong questions about WWII? ANTISEMITE!</p>

<p>Are you a gentile who laughed a little too hard at a Mel Brooks movie? ANTISEMITE</p>

<p>All I can say is don&#39;t fall into the trap because it is designed to invalidate anything you say. Do I think this is a jewish conspiracy? No, I don&#39;t. I think it is simply a form of political expedience that has worked effectively for more than a century, so why would you stop? It is no different from how the left ran the word &quot;racist&quot; into the ground for people who work against their agenda, except the antisemite label apparently has longer legs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>All that said, instead of blaming nebulous groups of people, name specific names. That is what TPTB don&#39;t want you to do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How do you feel about the following post by Glen Compton?
I really appreciate it.</p>

<p>I am pretty sure it [antisemitism] is a trap for people who get close to the truth. There was an effort during the election to brand anti-globalism as a code for anti-semitism. I think that is a REALLY big hint.
The concept of everything being the fault of &quot;the jews&quot; is intentionally reductive, because such simplified ideas are naturally appealing. This serves well to catch anyone going down the rabbit hole in a sort of gravity well that will get them branded a racist/nazi/antisemitite. The Truth is that there are a subset of people, some of which are jewish, who control a ridiculous number of very important industries and hold a great deal of political and financial control. They aren&#39;t exclusively jewish though, but there are enough that you can point to it as a trend and people will go in that direction.
There is a massive difference between the little old lady who lives down the road and Mossad. Yet you see that anyone who is critical of Israel&#39;s influence on domestic or global politics, on either side of the political aisle, get branded with the antisemitic label.
Are you Critical of Israel&#39;s treatment of Palestinians? ANTISEMITE!
Are you wary of the influence that global bankers and hedge fund managers hold over our politicians? ANTISEMITE!
Ever notice that nepotism runs rampant in the media and in Hollywood? ANTISEMITE
Have you ever asked the wrong questions about WWII? ANTISEMITE!
Are you a gentile who laughed a little too hard at a Mel Brooks movie? ANTISEMITE
All I can say is don&#39;t fall into the trap because it is designed to invalidate anything you say. Do I think this is a jewish conspiracy? No, I don&#39;t. I think it is simply a form of political expedience that has worked effectively for more than a century, so why would you stop? It is no different from how the left ran the word &quot;racist&quot; into the ground for people who work against their agenda, except the antisemite label apparently has longer legs.
All that said, instead of blaming nebulous groups of people, name specific names. That is what TPTB don&#39;t want you to do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, If I may boil down all the blubidblub of your extended post, you are a Jews who is butt hurt because people on this sub sometimes claim that Jews own and control the media, control the money supply, control the universities and think tanks, control Congress, and control the justice system. I suggest you kick your shoes off, make some nice herbal tea, and listen to relaxing music with your eyes closed. You&#39;ll feel better after a few minutes.</p>

<p>This is the issue. I, for one, do not think all Jews are evil…but if you can sit back and allow those to whom you feel connected/aligned to spout such hateful rhetoric without uttering a word in condemnation then perhaps you are…forgive me…a hypocrite.</p>
