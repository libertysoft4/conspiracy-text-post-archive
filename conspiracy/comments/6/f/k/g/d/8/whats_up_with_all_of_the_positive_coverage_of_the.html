What is the best possible way to change or increase the likelihood of positive public perception of a political figure?

    <div class="md"><p>GHWB led Operation 40 and supervised killing JFK, he facilitated removing Nixon, he attempted to have Reagan assassinated in coup #3 but took over anyhow, he smuggled drugs with Clinton during Iran-Contra.  Over his career he lost elections over and over and over again, but the Rockefellers and his father placed him in positions of great power.  His father, Prescott, attempted to buy Smedley Butler to create war for profit, when that failed they moved on to a performer known as Adolf Hitler and gave him $32,000,000.  GHWB&#39;s father-in-law was Aleister Crowley.  When initiated into Skull and Bones he chose the biblical name Magog.  Why are there always so many similar topics that run each day on Reddit, is it part of the planned narrative?</p>
