<p>There are a tons of conservative and anti-liberals subs, so I don&#39;t see how the Admins are censoring conservative narrative tbh. </p>

<p>Reddit Admins recently banned a mod from <a href="/r/The_Donald">/r/The_Donald</a> </p>

<p>Point to one subreddit where PizzaGate can be researched and discussed that hasn&#39;t had it&#39;s moderator team replaced by Reddit admins.  If you say <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, then point to one post containing original research, all of it had to move off Reddit and is now being conducted mostly on voat, go talk to them if you are interested in the truth.</p>

It also doesnt explain why ads.reddit.com advertised that T_D had 6 mil subscribers which puts it on par w/ the defaults &amp; is impressive for such a new sub.  But the public counter sits at 400k*+.  Then after T_D found that shit that changed it to 28 mil monthly views or some shit.  Its illegal to lie to people paying u to advertise so that is suspicious.  There were other subs that ads.reddit.com had discrepancies from what they were telling advertisers.  </p>

<p>Remember when people used to say reddit needed to learn how to make money? And how people don&#39;t say that anymore? Corporate learned and now they sell community product-placement on a massive scale sitewide. </p>

<p>The Democratic National Convention (or perhaps disgruntled Hill-financeers) are willing to put up a lot of cash to keep the anti-trump agenda on track.

<p>Hillary Clinton is not &quot;very far to the left&quot;. Bernie Sanders would be called center-left in most of the world and even he&#39;s much further left than the &quot;site-wide operation to curate public opinion&quot; (i.e., Democratic Party astroturfing) would allow.</p>
