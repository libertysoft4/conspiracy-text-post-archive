<p>Two if your anti trump why are you on T_D, I got banned from their in one comment that wasn&#39;t even anti trump, but you have multiple posts, HOW can anyone that thinks he should be locked up not get banned from their after the first post.</p>

<p>Third you sure seem to have a lot of time on your hands posting on this sub a lot, maybe its time to get a hobby if your spending a lot of time here, just a suggestion unless you have some other reason to spend a lot of time on this sub.</p>

<p>The guy is a troll who&#39;s trying to pose as a pro-Trumper who&#39;s posing as an anti-Trumper.

This is very very difficult to do accidentally. Try it.</p>

<p>If you were to ask if people ever landed on the moon, some people would agree to all three of these answers: &quot;No, it&#39;s not possible.&quot; &quot;Yes, the nazzis.&quot; and &quot;No, because moon doesn&#39;t <em>really</em> exist.&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s because these people treat conspiracy like paranoia. &quot;Don&#39;t know what, don&#39;t know where, but somethings wrong and all over here.&quot;</p>

<p>you make a claim, such as that you have done an experiment on the moon where you drop a hammer and a feather at the same time, to see if they hit the ground at the same time. </p>

<p>then, other people try to replicate your experiment, as per the scientific method. </p>

<p>when, after 50 years of nobody being able to replicate your experiment, your experiment is finally dismissed as the garbage that it always was. </p>

<p>And they proved nothing new on the moon. Nothing, that we would need to &quot;repeat&quot; to prove.

<p>Also, as I clearly went to school, peep this - other way how science works. A chap comes out with a theory. Other chaps look at the theory and points out flaws. In some threads even 249 chaps.</p>

<p>i read all of the comments, and replied to all of them</p>

<p>individually, each comment is just another idiots opinion, just like OP&#39;s opinion.</p>

<p>and collectively they do not &quot;debunk&quot; OP. they had their opportunity to show where the problems were, and there were some problems, such as a disagreement over the relative mass of the Earth to the Moon.</p>

<p>OP says the mass is 1:6 whereas the peers claim the mass is 1:100 </p>

<p>so, regardless if the mass is 1/6 or 1/100th, the underlying story-problems remain, but just have to be reconfigured for which-ever mass ratio you <em>feel</em> is correct. </p>

<p>so, Let Earth to Moon mass ratio be 1/100 instead of 1/6, and now we have moved the Lagrange Point farther from Earth and closer to the Moon, which means the mass of the astronauts and their support gear had to go that much farther from Earth to reach a Lagrange Point. it could be argued that if the Earth:Moon mass was only 1/100, then the moon landing would have been that much harder. why? because the astronaut and his gear will be gaining <em>Gravitational Potential Energy</em> every mm of the way from Earth to the Lagrange Point. as we all know, by the Law of Conservation of Energy, that astronauts cannot gain Potential Energy without inputting and/or converting kinetic energy, and vice versa  </p>

<p>so, there are some points of contention, and i appreciate the feedback, as it helps me sharpen my understanding and helps me articulate my thoughts more precisely </p>

<p>31 minutes ago in <a href="/r/askreddit">/r/askreddit</a> you made a submission entitled:</p>

<p>In fact, I&#39;m tagging you in RES as &quot;Trump supporter that meant to send a PM but accidentally posted it as a submission to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, outing themselves as being paid to go on reddit and pretend to dislike Trump (while making lots of typos so as to discredit anti-Trump people), then subsequently deleted the post before asking in <a href="/r/askreddit">/r/askreddit</a> whether mods can see posts that have already been deleted&quot;</p>

<p>you make a claim, such as that you have done an experiment on the moon where you drop a hammer and a feather at the same time, to see if they hit the ground at the same time. </p>

<p>then, other people try to replicate your experiment, as per the scientific method. </p>
