        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">501</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2017-06-08 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/Pr1s0nTim3.html">Pr1s0nTim3</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It&#39;s carrying over to the sub, and we need to push back.</p>

<p>Yes, the same Megyn Kelly who defended James Alefantis on fox during his interview...</p>

<p>When I was on this sub as a previous user, <a href="/u/djklbd">/u/djklbd</a>, I had been calling out Trump as a puppet of the establishment for months leading up to the election. Evidence of this can be found in my post history on that account. I believe this election was part of a much bigger, and more sinister scheme than simply just securing another puppet for the next 4 years. </p>

<p>This election helps contribute to several things; <strong>ramping up the racial tension/sexual division in the US, and subverting the resistance movement, chief among them.</strong></p>

<p>It appears to me, that for TPTB to deal with  the fast growing &quot;conspiracy and alternative thinking culture&quot;, they need to &quot;suck&quot; or &quot;pull us into&quot; the left/right paradigm somehow, to remove our effectiveness as opposition to their method of control. </p>

<p><strong>We are KNOWN for criticizing this paradigm of control</strong>. Now more than ever, it needs a group of serious, non-political critics: US, conspiracy theorists and alternative thinkers. </p>

<p>The establishment knows that people are starting to question this rigged two party system, and the non partisan appeal of our sub/community is dangerous to them.</p>

<p>They are using Alex Jones and other alternative media figures, to &quot;lead&quot; us and merge us incrementally with partisan  politics, specifically REPUBLICAN and RIGHT-pro trump politics.</p>

<p><strong>What&#39;s up with all the CNN (the liberal outlet) bashing always on the front page,  but everyone thinks FOX (the republican outlet) news are saints? By design...</strong></p>

<p>Alex and <strong>the shills on this sub know this plot</strong>. This election was designed to make Trump look like an &quot;outsider&quot; to us, as if he beat crooked Hillary and defeated the globalists! (Bullshit...)</p>

<p>This scheme the social engineers and elite dreamt up, is to subvert our effectiveness as a resistance to their tyranny. </p>

<p><strong>&quot;If we can SUCK the alternative media culture into slowly endorsing right partisan politics and trust for our puppet president, our biggest critics (conspiracy theorists), become our allies and gatekeepers of our puppet!&quot;</strong></p>

<p>This is fucking Happening folks. Let&#39;s stop bullshitting ourselves. This is EXACTLY what you see on this sub too. Their little social experiment seems to be working, however I sill believe much of the &quot;organic&quot; trump support you see on THIS sub in particular is manufactured by shills to prop up this little charade the social engineers came up with. </p>

<p>Alex Jones is their pied piper leading us into the grinder. I Don&#39;t trust him 100% anymore. </p>

<p><strong>Last E</strong>: The Russia Conspiracy seems to be a &quot;cloak&quot; or &quot;sheild&quot; the social engineers and MSM generated, that Trump has against criticism from conspiracy theorists. Just because I don&#39;t believe in the Russia BS, DOESN&#39;T mean i don&#39;t think the administration isn&#39;t up to the usual New World Order criminal mafia bullshit the last 5 puppet presidents were subservient to. </p>

<p>They want to make us chase the DNC crimes, while this &quot;blatant russia conspiracy with tons of so called evidence&quot; passes us by, just to make us appear partisan. I know we are just following the leaks and pursuing what we have evidence for which happens to be DNC crimes, and we do a damn good job. However, be open to the possibility that this makes us appear partisan. This is why you see a lot of &quot;you guys are just TD 2.0!! Comments.</p>

<p>It could be a trick. Seth is the leaker and Russia conspiracy is fake we can all agree, I don&#39;t think they&#39;re plotting with Russia. Instead I think they&#39;re up to the same &quot;business as usual&quot; Henry Kissinger/Saudi/Israel NWO led criminal global government bullshit, and <strong>&quot;Russia&quot; is like a little &quot;sheild&quot; they can use against legit criticisms of their administration.</strong></p>

<p>&quot;I think Trump is a New world Order asset&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, you must be peddling Russian BS!&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s a way of having conspiracy theorists keep each other in line, protecting their little puppet. This can&#39;t last forever, eventually hes going to do something that stomps on the constitution and he will be exposed. But the MSM JUST keeps fucking talking about it 24/7 and breathing all this life into it...That&#39;s how I can tell it&#39;s probably horseshit, they are using it for <em>something</em>. Odds are it is not going to benefit us lol...</p>

<p>PLEASE, recognize that this is happening and discuss amongst our community. We need to REACT to this. Jones and Trumps administration and our corrupt government/elite need to be held accountable. Spread the word ✌️ </p>

<p>higher standard</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Shouldn&#39;t the absolute basic standard of this sub be that people want to hold the powerful accountable?</p>

<p>Mods should be held to a higher standard, but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s what anyone is suggesting in this situation. People are frustrated because this place used to be about acknowledging the corrupting influence of power, but now we have a bunch of users and mods who don&#39;t want to hold the POTUS to account because he&#39;s &quot;their side&quot;.</p>

<p>Anyone who dared call themselves an Obama supporter on this subreddit during the last eight years got drowned in downvotes, and rightly so. Everyone here understood that we wanted to hold the government accountable. If a mod had declared themselves a partisan supporter of the POTUS, there would have been a massive shitstorm until they were gone.</p>

<p>Half of the people who spent the last eight year here criticising Obama probably voted for him, but once he was in power and trashing the constitution, no one was defending him, and calling yourself an Obama supporter was justifiably karmic suicide.</p>

<p>People are just disappointed that after eight years of this sub all trying to hold the government and its puppetmasters accountable regardless of their &#39;side&#39;, suddenly this place is filled with bootlicking sycophants who are willing to overlook the corruption of the current government because now it&#39;s their side committing it.</p>

<p>No one was asking to hold you to a higher standard (although, really, you&#39;re a mod so you should be), we&#39;re just disappointed that the basic standard of this subreddit has fallen so far. Instead of &quot;fight all corruption and the conspirators controlling the world behind the scenes&quot; now this subreddit is &quot;let&#39;s just chat about a single senator from the party that&#39;s not in government&quot;.</p>

<p>Supporting the government is the opposite of the reason for this subreddit&#39;s existence, regardless of whose &#39;team&#39; the POTUS is from.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Warning: Rant, not directed at any particular user(s).</p>

<p>People have political opinions. That&#39;s a right. But now a lot of people are substituting conscious political differences of opinion with childish emotional reactions.  </p>

<p>I was a Bernie fan. Then decided to &quot;throw away&quot; my vote to Stein when I saw I was being forced to choose between a walking parody and a quasi-dead elite-approved policy zombie. </p>

<p>I&#39;m over the American political stage now. Modern technologies have allowed for a top down pyramid structured government in lock step where it counts without fail and without regard for the will of the people.</p>

<p>You&#39;ve even got local government side stepping the law and signing into agreements with foreign powers.  Even if it is &quot;just for show&quot; it can/will set a precedent for foreign control over US policy. Imagine an intervention in America to &quot;save us&quot; from Trump and ourselves. It&#39;s almost hilarious. It&#39;s easy to look at it and suspect some kind of game is getting played.</p>

<p>I&#39;m ranting. But people can believe whatever the fuck they want to as long as they respect the laws that are just and benefit all people. This crying about putting people away for their beliefs is the same kind of shit we were supposed to have learned something from over all the years of fighting and persecution.  </p>

<p>For anyone to come in here and tell anyone else that they&#39;re lesser or should be harshly judged over a political difference should be ashamed.  While you&#39;re hounding someone over a virtual non-difference and something as trivial as a political difference of opinion (that can be approached peacefully or at least tactfully) you&#39;re drawing attention away from the people who literally could kill you and bill your family for the trouble.  </p>

<p>And this is coming from a person who is very socially liberal.  Lay off the political back bitching and focus on exposing the people who are fucking us in every way possible, which is literally in the case of those unfortunate victims of high profile sex trafficking.</p>

<p><a href="/u/flytape">/u/flytape</a> has been around, and even if I differ with his opinions politically I can still separate that from the purpose of this sub. But I&#39;m fucking suspicious of all the new mods and a few of the old ones. I won&#39;t bother calling anyone out as that would just be a bunch of dramatic BS. But this sub is nose diving fast over politics. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I read the OP&#39;s reply to this comment, and laughed. They will <em>never</em> understand Trump, and they just assume you&#39;re an idiot for voting for him pretty much no matter what. Whether or not OP realizes it, his OP post is actually counterproductive because it not so subtly bashes people he disagrees with politically, furthering the problem of politicization of this sub (maybe it&#39;s by design.)</p>

<p>I just wanted to say that you&#39;re not alone in this. There are millions of people out there just like you who feel the way you do about Trump. Look at the media coverage of Trump...they <em>fucking hate him.</em> Look at the Deep State&#39;s treatment of Trump...they <em>fucking hate him.</em> Look at the globalists&#39;s treatment of Trump...they <em>fucking hate him.</em> But you know what? The American people don&#39;t hate him. They elected him to be President, and the fact that he angers those that look down upon and chastize the American public is proof enough to me that Trump is the real fucking deal - even if he&#39;s not perfect, he&#39;s an outsider who isn&#39;t beholden to Beltway politics. That is exactly what the American public wanted, and exactly what they got on November 8th. </p>

<p>Fuck the haters, they are literally incapable of understanding Trump or the mindset of people who voted for him - because they themselves are small minded and weak people who look down on others they disagree with.</p>

<p>Idiots as a general rule will always accuse <em>everyone else</em> of being an idiot first. Yeah, you were &quot;led&quot; to vote for Trump, like a little sheep, because this dude can&#39;t grasp your mindset or motivations, and why Trump is what a lot of us have been wanting for a long, long time.</p>

<p>It&#39;s horse shit.</p>

<p>Pointing out that people like discussing some of the crazy that goes on in this subreddit is victim blaming?  I&#39;m not sure that you understand what victim blaming is.

    <div class="md"><p>I think the key is that with a limited hangout there is still some truth being presented, it&#39;s just distorted around certain points.  So it traps the free thinkers by talking about the real issues, but uses strategic misdirection and lots of confusion and uncertainty to sow doubt.</p>

<p>Alex Jones made it clear in his Joe Rogan interview that he thinks the MSM spun pizzagate into a ridiculous strawman to ridicule conspiracy communities and that the emails, the fishy connections, and the broader context of child sex rings is still a huge valid issue.   I think it&#39;s pretty clear that&#39;s an accurate assessment. </p>

<p>Now, Jones flipping and backing off, plugging Kelly, and definitely the Trump worship, are all worrying.  All these things definitely point to limited hangout/psyop.  But again, there is still probably a good deal of truth mixed in. </p>

<p>And even if there isn&#39;t, it&#39;s still worth keeping a finger on the pulse of infowars so we know what cards are being played.  </p>

<p><strong>Here&#39;s my take:</strong> they would not have shilled that hard for Hillary if TPTB didn&#39;t want her in there.  I think Trump may be a legitimate disruption of power, but it&#39;s foolish to think he&#39;ll have the means necessary to actually work against them- and he probably recognizes this.  I think it&#39;s more likely that he&#39;s playing ball where he needs to in order to secure a few core American interests as he sees them (or as his connections see their own interests).  That&#39;s why he&#39;ll bomb Syria and allow that regime change bullshit to happen, but he&#39;ll put his foot down on deals he thinks will be bad for America.</p>

<p>Idk, I may very well be wrong, and I&#39;m open to OP&#39;s theory.  In fact it sounds pretty plausible.  But t_d got mocked for their 4d chess meme, clinging to hope that everything is going according to plan... and I think we ought to be careful not to make the corollary 
assumption that the ruling elite are all-powerful and everything is going according to their plan.  There are constant power plays in politics.  They&#39;re playing the same game, but I don&#39;t think everyone is on the same team. </p>

<p>My ratiocination may be wrong. That being said, I think the zionist plutocrats from both nations would have more to gain from collaboration rather than from global war. For instance, the Abramovitch, the Abramov, the Deripaska <a href="http://www.jewwatch.com/jew-occupiedgovernments-CIS-oligarchs.html">greater list here</a> joining the Rothschilds, the Morgans, the Goldman/Sachs, etc. into forming the greatest financial oligopolies of history.</p>

<p>What I&#39;m trying to say here is : What if instead of pushing us into a world order by motivating fear of Russia, they are pushing us into a world order by motivating fear of WW3? </p>

<p>Obviously I may be grossly wrong, but that&#39;s just my theory.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s called picking your battles. Even though I think most of us agree Pizzagate is real, it is going to be a tough slog to prove. By him expending credibility on it, it may damage his other efforts. He goes down that route, and he potentially gets wiped out completely - either through legal action or through credibility. If he deemed the threat of a deep state to be more of issue than expending potential money and valuable capital on Pizzagate, then he may have put the Pizzagate to the side to allow others to take it over. </p>

<p>Also, perhaps he backed off of it because if it got any bigger then TPTB would begin to really cover their tracks on it. This way, they can be lulled into a false sense of security thinking the worst has passed and then they may make a misstep or get careless.</p>

<p>I swear, sometimes this subreddit goes conspiracy-ception where there are three or four conspiracies on top of one another. This isn&#39;t a knock against you OP, but I think it is hard enough to keep one of these conspiracies under wraps, let alone have them stacked like Russian nesting dolls.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My theory is that it is more psy-op by TPTB. They are fomenting civil unrest in an effort to incite a civil war. Trump became very popular with the &quot;silent majority&quot; who had basically given up on politics. They could not sufficiently arouse that element of society to get emotionally involved. When they saw Trump become so popular with that demographic, they decided to use him to enrage them. they alread have all other elements of society on edge. The blacks, hispanics, women, muslims, etc. They needed to incite the very large block of &quot;silent majority&quot;, basically rural and suburban whites, and make them rebel. Look what they are doing. Put Trump in and now are intent on getting him removed. What do you think is going to happen if he gets removed from office????? What a huge psy-op.

    <div class="md"><p>The thing that sticks for me is how the zionist aspect of the NWO is making them uncomfortable.. This aligns perfectly with Trump (and everybody else in the public sphere) being 1000% behind Israel, therefore the Rothschild empire.  At one point, in the last few months, a guest on the Infowars mentioned how Trump was aligned with the Rothschilds and AJ didn&#39;t quite know how to positioned himself on that matter.. Wasn&#39;t expected.. The guest was stating that it was a competition between the Rockefellers (throught Clinton) and and the red shields throught Trump.  Was fascinating to have some beans spilled right there. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>All the conspiracy community can do is continue to follow the evidence of fuckery in a non partisan manner, regardless of what may or may not be going on behind the scenes. I would like to see a little more boldness from the community when we have more than just circumstantial evidence of fuckery. Like going ahead and filing that claim against the DNC, and maybe make less noise when the evidence is weak and wouldn&#39;t stand a chance in a court of law. By less noise I don&#39;t mean less discussion or investigations into certain conspiracies, it just means to keep it within the community until we have enough evidence. Anyway, It&#39;s just my 2¢ on how we could win more hearts and minds and be taken more seriously, which leads to more people waking up. But most of all I agree with the OP, our strength lays in our non partisan approach, it is vital.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>True, and it will likely get worse if/when we become more of a force that isn&#39;t ignored. I see a lot more infighting ahead along the lines of: &quot; who said you get to decide which are psyops and which are genuine conspiracies&quot;, hopefully, we&#39;ll let the objective evidence speak for itself and a consensus will emerge. We will need people like yourself to remind us now and then when we blindly stray from our path and start falling for their tricks. It&#39;s probably unrealistic to think that an internet community could accomplish any significant good against TPTB, but people have died trying, his name was Seth Rich, it would be such a waste if they died in vain.</p>

<p>He didnt used to rant about &quot;the globalists&quot;, he would say Global Elite Bankers (and things of that sort)</p>

<p>I stopped being a fan when he started using the term &quot;globalist&quot;, because that forces you into a false dichotomy of globalism vs nationalism. Nationalism is extremely dangerous and I wont play that game. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Conspiracy theories have always been a staple of right-wing politics, <em>way</em> more than left-wing politics. There is a conspiracy &quot;culture,&quot; that has persisted since at least the early &#39;80s, that embraced libertarianism as an answer to what it saw as government overreach. This naturally tied the conspiracy culture with more right-wing ideologies (Von Mises, Ron Paul, the radical libertarian movement of the &#39;90s that spawned Timothy McVeigh and Ted Kaczynski.)</p>

<p>This is because <em>most but not all</em> left-wing ideologies, as a general rule, embrace the government as a force for good and &quot;social change,&quot; whereas <em>most but not all</em> right-wing ideologies <em>in modern America</em> see the government as an instrument of oppression. There&#39;s a reason Ron Paul and Barry Goldwater were a Republican, and that reason is that libertarianism <em>mostly</em> aligns with the modern American right-wing (think Reagan&#39;s famous screeds against government intervention.)</p>

<p>One example: gun rights are almost entirely a right winger&#39;s cause, and for the modern conspiracy theorist (someone who inherently does not trust government, especially government restrictions of individual autonomy) that would naturally align them with the right wing. </p>

<p>Any leftist&#39;s answer to a given problem in society usually revolves around getting the government to come in and solve it. No offense, but leftists are generally naive with regards to government corruption. They think the government can &quot;solve&quot; corporate greed for example, in the long term, with no respect to the kind of regulatory capture we see occurring with the FCC/Comcast. </p>

<p>TL;DR: Conspiracy theorists incl. Alex Jones do naturally align with the American right wing. </p>

<p>PS: I do agree with you that AJ is a PsyOp, though, but you mistake <em>who</em> he is conducting a PsyOp against. AJ is there to poison the well and make Right Wingers/Conspiracy Theorists look like stark-raving idiots. Notice that AJ popped up right after McVeigh and Kaczynski. Notice also his family&#39;s ties to the CIA. I do enjoy his show, though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, there&#39;s just all kinds of weird experiments going on and just stuff that is off the charts. And it&#39;s industrial level.</p>

<p>&quot;I&#39;m not bragging when I say that when, in the 80&#39;s - because late 80&#39;s my mom and dad had multiple discussions - and my dad would say, &quot;Let&#39;s talk about it privately,&quot; and stuff like that, with my mom, so I never heard all of it, and he won&#39;t talk about it today - where the CIA tried to hire him, because I had some family that did stuff for the CIA, to be inducted in Maryland into literal, below ground bases for a four-year secret tour. And they were hiring other top dentists that were pioneering implants. My dad pioneered implants and would, you know, taught it at medical school and all that. ... And it was literally, they just said, &quot;It&#39;s cybernetics, it&#39;s highly advanced,&quot; and it was $400,000 a year, way more than he was making then, and he owned dental offices. And he said, &quot;No,&quot; because my dad did work at the medical school. He was someone who would do medical procedures on high level CIA people. They would come to him and then they would not allow deadening. They would have people there watching while he did procedures on people, just because they can&#39;t be put under. That was back during the Cold War. And so my dad did do that. He&#39;ll probably get mad I&#39;m even telling this. But the whole point is, what this guy was talking about, it&#39;s reportedly really bad what is going on. ...</p>

<p>&quot;And it, it, it&#39;s just, it&#39;s just, from what I&#39;ve been told by high level people - not my dad, he was just, went and interviewed, and was told about it and, um, uh, it&#39;s just, it&#39;s just, it&#39;s just, we&#39;re not in Kansas is what I&#39;m trying to tell people.&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>At this point it should be obvious to everyone here that Jones is not to be trusted in the slightest. But my question is how exactly did it get to this point where Jones is just shilling for Trump? I&#39;m not 100 percent familiar with how Jones started in the business, but didn&#39;t he initially gain traction from exposing the really strange and disturbing stuff that happens at Bohemian Grove? So how did we get from there to here? Was Jones <em>always</em> a tool of disinformation or was he pulled aside at some point and told to play ball or else he&#39;ll get the old JFK shampoo special?</p>
