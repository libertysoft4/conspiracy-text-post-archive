        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This subreddit needs to ask itself an essential question. </p>

<p>Are you here to pass the time and share interesting conspiracy-related tidbits with like-minded individuals? Or are you here to organize with like-minded individuals in an effort to put an end to the elitist conspiracy that all of you are privy to, to one degree or another? </p>

<p>This community has enormous potential for revealing, and therefore obstructing, the grand strategy that has been in effect for a long, long time. You all may disagree as to certain details of the conspiracy, but you all see the outline of something grotesque, insidious and against the better interests of the vast majority of humanity. Reddit, be it as manipulated and biased as it is, has given us a public space to meet with like-minded individuals across the planet who have done the work and see &quot;it&quot; clearly. </p>

<p>However, more often than not, this community behaves like a cat chasing laser pointers, and acts like the shadow side of the mainstream audience. Trying to place your paw on one spectacle story after another, trying to find where it fits into the larger picture. Sometimes this community succeeds, sometimes it doesn&#39;t. Either way, before anything can be done about the first spectacle story, the next one comes around. And so it goes. </p>

<p>If your answer to the first question above was the latter, as I hope it is, then this community needs focus and organization. Again, this subreddit has great potential to do an essential duty to mankind by revealing the conspiracy which official investigations always stop short of doing. Now we must figure the areas to focus and organize around. </p>

<p>As far as I can see it, these are the questions which will guide that focus for the community. </p>

<p>1) If we&#39;re looking to unravel the entire all-encompassing cloak of lies and secrecy, which thread (sub-conspiracy) should our energy focus pulling on? This question involves understanding which thread is within our reach, has the most objective evidence supporting it, and is the easiest for the mainstream to understand. </p>

<p>2) After we find the thread with the highest probability of effectiveness, how do we go about pulling it? </p>

<p>I look forward to your thoughts. </p>

<p>The way I see it they are both intertwined, but IMO the Orwellian suppression of free speech - where the truth is hidden from us - precedes and determines the Huxleyian internal passivity, or laziness to seek and speak the truth.</p>

<p>Orwellian works off playing to people&#39;s fears. The Huxleyian method works by playing to people&#39;s comfort. The latter pushes any voices of truth to the sidelines of irrelevance. This is where even a respected voice like Chomsky&#39;s has been for most of his career. </p>

<p>Thank you for answering. But these terms are still too vague, to be frank. What tangible ideas do you have to fill these noble words with life?
Every time you try to dismantle an old system - perhaps by &quot;pulling the initial thread&quot; - you need to know what you replace it with. What holistic plans for the society do you have in mind?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Say the ideal, even unlikely, is worldwide collective effort for a networked democracy, with an emphasis on community level governance. </p>

<p>The key is perception. Each person being an integral part of different network circles, starting with community, expanding in intervals (state, country) until you arrive at humanity. What are your responsibilities to each network, if your ideas mattered? How much does each network affect your life? On what network should we place the emphasis of policies which affect our daily lives? </p>

<p>If enough people agree that such an ideal could be in their best interests and should be the goal to strive for... from there, different models and forms would be tested. The better it gets, the more it attracts people to it. The more people contributing, the better it gets. </p>

<p>Surely the intelligence and wisdom necessary for creating effective and liberating forms of democratic government didn&#39;t disappear in 1789. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would say that we have to identify as many of those involved as we can.  We probably all assume that it&#39;s just about all high-level players in all fields, political and commercial, so... Idk - we gotta figure out who has insider knowledge, and who might somehow be persuaded to speak up about it.  Like that Norwegian banker guy (or Dutch, or whatever, from a couple months ago).  We gotta figure out which people are involved and then figure out which ones might still have functional consciences. Make personal appeals to conscience - that&#39;s my idea.</p>

<p>Another thought, anyone involved is probably pretty terrified of tptb, so we&#39;ve got to do something to make them feel safe in coming forward.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This sub is heavily loaded with false conspiracies to distract from the real conspiracy that as you state has been going on with increasing effectiveness since the assassinations of the 60s. </p>

<p>Here are some of the false conspiracies:  </p>

<p>It is all about secret satan worshiping elites directect by aliens.  </p>

<p>Versus investigating and revealing what information exists about the possibility of alien presence. </p>

<p>Versus, identifying and exposing the people we have elected who are busy carrying out the agendas of the wealthiest who have one goal, more control and wealth and freedom for themselves which 
requires that they take it from us and deny any freedom to us.  </p>

<p>Real conspiracies include. </p>

<p>The long war against equal rights for all which limits and dilutes  participation of all against the oligarchy, and importantly includes keeping everyone divided into powerless factions. </p>

<p>The long war against public education because dummies are easier to frighten, manipulate and control. </p>

<p>The now complete elimination of the individual rights as stated in the first ten amendments. </p>

<p>Wage suppression that began in the 70s which once provided income for the working class to own their own homes and is now making it difficult to even rent and has eroded the middle class and the professional class to a pitiful debt ridden insecure status.  </p>

<p>The creation of the EITC, 1976,  the long period of high unemployment, 2  years, in the 80s that went over 10% for 10 months, the theft of the pension funds, and more and the first privatization of good paying jobs to low wage contractor jobs and the introduction of widespread individuals working as  independent contractors. </p>

<p>The many bubble-bursts that have been used to strip wealth beginning with the the farm bubble bust, a housing bubble bust and that Black Monday black market stock market crash. 
All preceded by propaganda to invest in farming, invest in housing, become the millionaire next door by buying stock.  </p>

<p>Repete for the 90s, repeat again for the 2000s
Helped with a stolen election. </p>

<p>And now another stolen election that was so through is was a coup. </p>

<p>And I do notice OP that you have carefully not stated any position or identity on what you consider the real conspiracies to be. </p>

<p>When I see posts like this, I think manipulation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fair enough. I left out my position as not to dissuade others from joining the debate. I&#39;ll give it to you right now. </p>

<p>Main Thesis- There is an hierarchy that has been in place for a long time. Over the course of the last 100 or so years, the top of this hierarchy has been intensifying its control over the populace. They seek to debilitate the individual and force him to become predictable, controllable and docile. Unless a portion acting out serves their immediate interests for the long game. They do so with a many-layered strategy. I&#39;ll paint with broad strokes. </p>

<p>1) Wall Street. Designed bubbles to consolidate businesses, giving citizens less economic say in matters. Sociopathic profit seeking behavior which ultimately funnels any of its rewards up, with severe consequences for the populace and for the world. Able to fund any other sub-conspiracies (terrorists) because of the high-paced transactions and obscure accounting. The Market is our god, and Wall Street are the high priests. Perpetual growth demands sacrifices past gods never would have dreamed of asking. </p>

<p>2) The CIA is strategical arm of Wall Street and of the wider conspiracy. A country wants economic autonomy. CIA will overthrow. A president wants to loosen the financial grip over an nation. CIA will assassinate. American public is becoming organized and aware. CIA will divide the solidarity through any means possible. CIA diverts public awareness to where it doesn&#39;t present problems. </p>

<p>3) Keep the public stupid. Keep the public hooked on the spectacle. Keep the public hooked on ideas which are totally against their best interest. Manipulate the public into being more self-interested, more reliant on authority. </p>

<p>4) The spectacle of politics is there to comfort people into believing they live in a democracy. They don&#39;t. Government prostituted itself to big business in intervals. Democrats and Repubs are two sides of the same corporate party, with appeals to two different types of personalities. </p>

<p>5) Big Data and the surveillance and control of the populace. Any threat to the system is identified and if necessary, acted upon. As you said, Bill of Rights are there as show, never in practice. Freedom has been stripped. </p>

<p>As for top of the pyramid, that&#39;s where it gets fuzzy for me. I have theories based in reasoning, but they come nowhere near the certainty that I have about the above (and many more.) </p>

<p>I&#39;m limited in time right now, but I hope that provides some foundation to where I come from. </p>

<p>Any questions, ask away. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The ones everyone calls NWO which of course is real and is the reason for the UN etc and was sold to the public as a way to stop the costly and deadly wars between nations but also included a lot of pacificatin of the masses but would have still retained some pretense of individual rights and would have included investment in education and  health care etc. </p>

<p>The LibertyBoyBirchers/libertarians who would achieve a more feudalistic system with no rights and only violence for control of the masses keeping only those willing to be entirely subservient with religion as a major tool to gain that subservience. It is this side of course seeking to partner up with Putin&#39;s Russia. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is a pretty evenly fought war at the moment and one reason there is so much confusion in the narrative and dialog, this, balance, was achieved by a reorganization of ownership at key providers like NYTimes and Washington Post the sale of NBC to Comcast and other manipulations of ownership  in 2011 and probably among the broadcast providers as well.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll reframe the question for clarity. </p>

<p>In your understanding, does the buck stop at these two sides? Or is there a further echelon above them either a) aware of but unconcerned about the result of the battle because either way, they win.. or b) controlling the narrative of the battle between the two sides for further divide i.e. the king splitting his lords into two camps to go at it? </p>
