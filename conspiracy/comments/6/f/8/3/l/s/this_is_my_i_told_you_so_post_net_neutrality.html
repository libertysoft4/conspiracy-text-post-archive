<p>&quot;We cannot allow this ideology the safe space it needs to breed - yet that is precisely what the internet, and the big companies that provide internet-based services provide,”

</blockquote>

<p>So this is how it would have started. There would have been some kind of event. The politicians and media would have cried &quot;we have to do something&quot; then they would used the regulating authority of the FCC, that net neutrality massively shifted to them.</p>

<p>First they would say we are only going to use this authority to target those planning terrorism...</p>

<p>Then some kid would be online bullied with hate speech and commit suicide, or something. Then they would say we are going to use these authorities to stop hate speech. And the spread of extremist views like conservatism.</p>

<p>Then like they had set up for a while already, Fake News!  remember them trying to make a big deal about fake new? Trump turned that around and used it against them, but this was a plan they had came up with directly to work with net neutrality. They would use it to go after all news sources they don&#39;t control.</p>

<p>Every time I tried to convey this message to people I was always met with denial and or ridicule. They always said to me the government regulation of the internet is to protect us.</p>

<p>I told you so. They always use fear and emotion to trick you into giving up your freedoms. They had an elaborate plan to incrementally roll out the internet&#39;s Ministry of Truth called Net Neutrality.  </p>

<p>EDIT addition</p>

<p>In case you don&#39;t know what Net Neutrality is. It stripped the authority of the FTC to protect internet consumers (so they couldn&#39;t impede the FCC), transfered that authority to the FCC, and reclassified the internet as a common carrier. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>A common carrier offers its services to the general public under license or authority provided by a regulatory body. The regulatory body has usually been granted &quot;ministerial authority&quot; by the legislation that created it. The regulatory body may <strong>create, interpret, and enforce its regulations</strong> upon the common carrier <strong>with independence and finality,</strong> as long as it acts within the bounds of the enabling legislation. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_carrier">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_carrier</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>You demonstrably do not because everything that you&#39;ve said in this post is wrong. Establishing ISPs as Title II carriers did not &quot;shift massive regulating authority&quot; to the FCC, and certainly not in a way where they could thereafter censor the web. The FCC still has the authority to make ISPs follow Title II but thanks to Doofenshmirtz and his band of idiots they&#39;re not going to. Do you know what this means? This means that the GIANT CORPORATE OLIGARCHS who control your access to the internet are free to censor, slow, and manipulate what you see and have access to.</p>

<p>From your link:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>An important legal requirement for common carrier as public provider is that <strong>it cannot discriminate, that is refuse the service unless there is some compelling reason.</strong> As of 2007, the status of Internet service providers as common carriers and their rights and responsibilities is widely debated</p>

<p>Censoring terrorists would never be a &quot;compelling reason&quot; to censor non-terrorists.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Net neutrality is the principle that Internet service providers and governments regulating the Internet should treat all data on the Internet the same, not discriminating or charging differentially by user, content, website, platform, application, type of attached equipment, or mode of communication.[1] The term was coined by Columbia University media law professor Tim Wu in 2003, as an extension of the longstanding concept of a common carrier, which was used to describe the role of telephone systems.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_neutrality">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_neutrality</a></p>

<p>The idea of net neutrality was to prevent both corporations <em>and</em> government from discriminating. Without net neutrality, the US government can decide to discriminate against any user for any reason.</p>

<p>Censoring terrorists is just one example, OP listed some others including internet bullying which has been a problem for a while. The extremely vague &quot;unless for compelling reasons&quot; is worrisome. </p>

<p>The &quot;compelling reason&quot; is terrorism now, and of course it is because who would have a problem stopping terrorists? It&#39;s getting you comfortable with censorship by saying censorship is going to be used &quot;for good&quot;. It&#39;s opening the door for more censorship in other avenues, for whatever reasons THEY find &quot;compelling&quot;.</p>

<p>What else is talked about in the news over and over again besides terrorism? &quot;Fake news&quot; and conspiracy theories are dangerous..what makes you think &quot;fake news&quot; isn&#39;t a &quot;compelling reason&quot; to discriminate?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Republicans want to end net neutrality to consolidate the power of their corporate puppeteers. But it gets worse ... Here&#39;s something yo8u may not know.</p>

<p>Republicans ALSO want to censor the internet as it pertains to &quot;terrorism.&quot;</p>

<p>They literally want to do BOTH and we are being lied to about both.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>They lie about what Net Neutrality is</p></li>
<li><p>Then they lie and pretend Democrats want to censor the internet.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>But since you probably haven&#39;t heard of #2, here is a huge piece of evidence:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On June 21, 2010, the Supreme Court held, by a 6-to-3 vote, that the statute&#39;s prohibitions on &quot;expert advice,&quot; &quot;training,&quot; &quot;service,&quot; and &quot;personnel&quot; were not vague, and did not violate speech or associational rights as applied to plaintiffs&#39; intended activities. Chief Justice Roberts wrote for the majority, reversing the Court of Appeals (which had ruled for plaintiffs) on the vagueness claims, and holding that while strict scrutiny apparently applied, even support in the form of intangibles like human rights training freed up resources for other illegal uses, and that combined with the government&#39;s interest in denying blacklisted groups legitimacy was sufficient to trump the First Amendment interests of the plaintiffs. </p>

<p>Former President Jimmy Carter criticized the decision, arguing that &quot;The &#39;material support law&#39; – which is aimed at putting an end to terrorism – actually threatens The Carter Center&#39;s work and the work of many other peacemaking organizations that must interact directly with groups that have engaged in violence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You do realize with Obama&#39;s Net Neutrality powers in place Trump could use the FCC as a tool to censor the left wing media and democrat campaign websites. All he would have to do is come up with an excuse. Hate speech, fake news, the CNN employee with an ISIS inspired decapitation picture. Oh it would be so easy with this power expansion of the FCC. I think Trump should reinstate NN and use it just to show you statists what your own medicine would feel like. LOL</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Whoa whoa whoa. People seem to be confusing &quot;access&quot; to the internet with &quot;censorship&quot; on the internet. If the threat of censorship (that will be selectively enforced by the FCC) is the problem, why does Monopoly and limited choice to access the internet inevitably come up as the argument? If you don&#39;t like your choices of internet, blame your mayor, your city council, county commissioners, even governor in most states, that rigged the game in favor of $$$ to screw you, the people, out of choice. &quot;But Comcast is eeeeevil!!!&quot;.

<p>This is a false statement. The Obama admin. rammed through net neutrality in the very end of his term. Most of it didn&#39;t go into effect until Jan. 2017 and some of it hadn&#39;t even gone into effect before Trump rolled it back. </p>

<p>Classic left wing class division tactics. The rich are going to make money if you don&#39;t allow the State to run the internet. You are using emotional reaction of jelousy and contempt to trick people into giving up freedom. Just as the communist gets the poor to rise up using their hatred of the wealthy to then make everyone poor except for the communists political class. </p>
