<p>For people who believe in climate change what do you have to say about this? </p>

<p>The governments like to cry about our climate dying but yet they have the money to fund NASA to send people to the moon 50 years ago, half a century ago, but yet don&#39;t have the money to fund another type of &quot;NASA&quot; to innovate cleaner method of transportation that can be adopted mainstream if climate change is such a major threat to humans. </p>

<p>Technology is exponentially growing...yet we still travel around filling up our tanks with gasoline while we cry climate change is killing us for 30 years. </p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t even make sense. </p>

<p>Reddit edit - we have the alternative energy but why hasn&#39;t it gone mainstream and in mass use if climate change is this serious of an issue and destroying our planet? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not the best to be talking about this but here&#39;s to hoping other people will chime in.</p>

<p>We could make an electric car, but it would be expensive (although with recent events that cost is coming down).</p>

<p>And we could build hydrogen powered cars but they seem to be a little unsafe. </p>

<p>We have found plenty of alternative fuels from what I can tell it&#39;s just that gas was the best bet for a while. </p>

<p>Batteries have always been the feature holding them back. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Probably because politicians don&#39;t make things, they don&#39;t actually contribute.  They blow 30 years of hot air up everyone&#39;s ass saying it needs to green. They could pass laws sure but if they say ban oil production in the US we would be catching horse draw buggies to work and bootlegging gas every chance we got.</p>

<p>The tech for electric cars and whatnot just isn&#39;t consumer ready for real mass production. I&#39;m not talking about  the handfuls of six figure Teslas or bmws but $10k-20k cars being produced by the millions( 200k-300k units per year from 1 manufacture is pretty standard for a hot seller). TBH I really don&#39;t think we will see it happen in our lifetime. The ICE has hundred year start and replaced the work horse, which was around for as you know since domestication</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You poor, dumb soul.</p>

<p>Practically all car manufacturers sell electric cars. What do you expect, every single person to go out and buy one to replace their current car? They&#39;re more expensive at the moment because the technology is only getting good enough the past 10 years, plus charging stations need to be built everywhere, which is getting done slowly. </p>

<p>Seriously, put at least one thought into something before you go spewing this crap on the internet. I miss this sub when it wasn&#39;t filled with frothing-at-the-mouth idiots</p>

<p>Electric cars from 50 years ago are VERY different from electric cars from 5 years ago, and today. Get that through your thick skull.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You miss the point, as so many liberals do. We have developed many ways to power our cars without gasoline or oil. There is electric, steam, natural gas, hydrogen, the fuel cell, capacitors, compressed air, and kinetic energy stored in flywheels, to name some of them.</p>

<p>The point your are missing is that gasoline is the <em>best way to power our cars</em> for many reasons. It is cheap. It is efficient (gas has a greater energy density than just about any other fuel). It is safe. The infrastructure already exists. We are familiar with it. And it is not polluting. Yes, you heard me, not polluting. There is no lead in gas these days, and the catalytic converters take out practically everything except CO2, which (I&#39;m teaching you here) is not only benign to the climate and the biosphere, but is hugely beneficial to the greening of deserts, the expansion of forests, and the higher yields of food crops that are feeding the Third World.</p>

<p>We use gas because it is the very best thing to use to power our cars.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;if we can&#39;t communicate between two buildings, how are we supposed to get to the moon and back&quot; - astronaut Gus Grissom, out spoken critic of the Apollo program before he was burned alive. </p>

<p>Fast forward two years later. </p>

<p>We blast off from earth, travel 240,000 miles, 600 times farther than any human has ever been. </p>

<p>Disengage from the orbiter, land flawlessly on a foreign body with different gravity. Do some shit. </p>

<p>Take off, reconnect with orbiter, travel again 240,000 miles another 600 times farther than ever, survive reentry. Then do the whole process several more times with no loss of life..... </p>

<p>That&#39;s gonna be a no from me dog. </p>
