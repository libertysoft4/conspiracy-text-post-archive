<p>why is it the suppression of science and the denial of scientific consensus</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Science is all about skepticism, check and rechecking data. There is no democratic consensus in the scientific method. Ostracizing those that dare question the official &quot;consensus&quot; as deniers/heretics shows it is actually an emotion based religion. </p>

<p>The temperature stopped rising in 1998. They then had to change the name from global warming to climate change. The climate always changes so it is kind of a moot name. Then they fiddled with the historic temp data to make the past look colder to make up for the stop in warming.. The ground tempurature data readings don&#39;t match reality because they show record high in polaces that actual reading are not taken. Also the satellite temp data does not match the ground temp data.  From the very start the global warming religion just used graph perspective manipulation to build there congregation. They created a new market where there was none creating many great paying climate jobs for climate scientists that were willing to join the church.  </p>

<p>This comment is just pure bullshit, nobody &quot;changed the name.&quot;</p>

<p>There have long been claims that some unspecificed &quot;they&quot; has &quot;changed the name from &#39;global warming&#39; to &#39;climate change&#39;&quot;. In reality, the two terms mean different things, have both been used for decades, and the only individual to have specifically advocated changing the name in this fashion is a global warming &#39;skeptic&#39;.</p>

<p>And even more hilarious is you&#39;re pushing the &quot;temperature stopped rising&quot; myth.</p>

<p>A) Nobody changed the name, global warming and &quot;climate change&quot; are 2 different things they always have been.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s NASA destroying your claim, but let me guess, NASA is biased against you right?</p>

<p>B) The temp did <strong>NOT</strong> stop rising in 1998. That argument is just again, objectively false.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Using the data that were available at the time (through 2012), the last climate report from the <strong>Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change concluded that there had been no statistically significant increase in global surface temperature from 1998-2012.</strong>
According to a new NOAA analysis, the warming trend during that period was somewhat smaller than the longer-term (1951-2012) trend, but it wasn’t zero. <strong>And with the latest data calibrations</strong> and the most recent two years of global temperatures added to the series</p>

<p>So my &quot;false claim&quot; is true and to to counter the collapsing of their religion the adjusted the data to fit their narrative just like a good scientists would right? <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/earth/environment/globalwarming/11395516/The-fiddling-with-temperature-data-is-the-biggest-science-scandal-ever.html">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/earth/environment/globalwarming/11395516/The-fiddling-with-temperature-data-is-the-biggest-science-scandal-ever.html</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>And here we go - when the science says you&#39;re wrong, the science is manipulated! How convenient a worldview that is.</p>

<p>Says it best:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Thanks to this self-insulating logic, attempting to refute a conspiracy theory is like nailing jelly to a wall. Since conspiracy theories are inherently unproven, the theory is always a work in progress, able to dodge refutation by inventing new twists and turns. Each debunking can be construed as disinformation designed to throw truth seekers off the scent, while the conspiracy theorists’ continued failure to blow the lid off the conspiracy merely testifies to the power of their enemy (and the gullibility of the masses). Conspiracy theories aren’t just immune to refutation—they thrive on it. If it looks like a conspiracy, it was a conspiracy. If it doesn’t look like a conspiracy, it was definitely a conspiracy. Evidence against the conspiracy theory becomes evidence of conspiracy. Heads I win, tails you lose.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_consensus">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_consensus</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Consensus is normally achieved through communication at conferences, the publication process, replication (reproducible results by others), and peer review. These lead to a situation in which those within the discipline can often recognize such a consensus where it exists, but communicating to outsiders that consensus has been reached can be difficult, because the &#39;normal&#39; debates through which science progresses may seem to outsiders as contestation.[2] On occasion, scientific institutes issue position statements intended to communicate a summary of the science from the &quot;inside&quot; to the &quot;outside&quot; of the scientific community. In cases where there is little controversy regarding the subject under study, establishing what the consensus is can be quite straightforward.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bottom line: CO2 is not related to global temperature. Never has been. Never will be except on a logarithmic scale of diminishing returns.   </p>

<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a plant food. The CO2 concentration in the atmosphere has been increasing for the last 150+ years thanks to human activity, due to extracting and consuming fossil fuels, as well as land use changes. The added CO2 has benefited and continues to benefit natural systems and agriculture. Scientists estimate that 15% of the current agricultural production comes from elevated CO2.</p>

<p>For most of Earth’s evolutionary history, the CO2 concentrations were much higher than they are today or that they can reach in the foreseeable future. For example, the CO2 concentration in the Jurassic period was 3-6 times higher than it is today. The so-called “pre-industrial atmosphere” was anomalously impoverished in CO2.
Our sun is the main source of energy on the Earth’s surface. Heat is removed from the Earth’s surface and lower atmosphere through multiple mechanisms, including convection and radiation. Earth radiates in the infrared spectrum. Gases with molecules having three or more atoms are infrared-active: their molecules can absorb and emit radiation in specific parts of the infrared spectrum. The main infrared-active gas in the Earth atmosphere is water vapor. CO2 plays a very minor role, except during ice ages. Further, it has a very narrow absorption/emission spectrum, and it is almost saturated even at low CO2 The amount of infrared radiation, temporarily absorbed by CO2 molecules in the atmosphere, grows nearly logarithmically (i.e., very slowly) with increases in CO2 concentrations.</p>

<p>Thus, the anthropogenic increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration has an extremely small warming effect, which is negligible compared with natural temperature fluctuations in any region. Even larger mean warming would be beneficial for human societies and the biosphere, especially as a buffer against natural temperature drops.</p>

<p>A greenhouse is a man-made construction, minimizing air convection that removes heat from the ground and thus increasing the inside air temperature. Most greenhouses are artificially enriched with CO2 to facilitate plants’ growth. CO2 plays no role in heat retention in a greenhouse.</p>

<p>The sea level has been rising since the last glacial episode, which ended about 20,000 years ago. In the last few thousands of years, the sea level has been rising at the rate of 0.2-1.0 inch per decade, and no acceleration has been detected in the last several decades. There are different opinions on whether discernible global warming would accelerate or decelerate sea level rises.</p>

<p>The oceans are alkaline, which is the opposite of acidic. The freshwater in most locations is slightly acidic.
Humans exhale CO2 with each breath.</p>

<p>Attributing hurricanes, droughts, and extreme weather events to anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions, or to any known global anthropogenic activity, has no scientific basis. It has antecedents in the medieval witch hunts that included accusations of “weather cooking.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Carbon Dioxide is a miniscule portion of our atmosphere, about .0039% It is not possible that the small portion of our atmosphere that is carbon dioxide would be able to alter the atmosphere the way the climate changers claim.</p>

<p>Dr. Patrick Moore, the co founder of Greenpeace, has stated that there is no evidence that humans are in any danger from global warming.  Rapid change last occurred at the end of the last glacial period. Dr. Moore left Greenpeace when the organization changed from a scientific to a political base.</p>

<p>Carbon Dioxide emissions have risen 30% with no warming. This is against many pundits and climate models who have been sounding the alarm of CO2 damage to the earth and the atmosphere. </p>

<p>There are arguments that are made in lockstep by all the pro climate change types. The argument that 97% of scientists agree with the pro climate change position is false. An examination of that study has shown that of the 12,000 papers evaluated, only 65 endorsed the study position. So the actual numbers is .5%. It also showed that many of the reports were mislabeled and about 35% of the reports studied that took no position were left out.</p>

<p>We were given an apocalyptic vision for the polar ice caps , that the coastlines would be inundated, and that the world would all but end. The Antarctic sea ice is at the highest level since measurements began with an extent of 12,965 million square kilometers. This is a figure that is 10.3 above the levels of 1981-2010 average. Just recently it was shown that the Arctic ice has not changed since 1940. But this will be ignored by Al Gore and the rest of the globalists who only want money to line their pockets and for world distribution. </p>

<p>John Coleman, who co founded the Weather Channel also disagreed with the academics pushing climate change. In a letter to the IPCC, Coleman has stated “the ocean is not rising . The polar ice is growing, not melting, polar bears are increasing, heat waves have diminished, and the environmental agenda has become political using invalid science.</p>

<p>The question is not whether the pro climate change agenda will collapse. The question is when.</p>

<p>Stop confusing your scientific illiteracy for actual science.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/if-carbon-dioxide-makes-u/">https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/if-carbon-dioxide-makes-u/</a></p>

<p>Again - you repeat something you clearly have not even a basic understanding of.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The next most abundant gases--water vapor and carbon dioxide--do absorb a portion of the infrared heat radiated by the earth&#39;s surface, thereby preventing it from reaching space. Instead of dissipating into space, the infrared radiation that is absorbed by atmospheric water vapor or carbon dioxide produces heating, which in turn makes the earth¿s surface warmer. This is known as the greenhouse effect and without it our planet¿s surface would likely be frozen, like Mars. The heat absorbed by water vapor and carbon dioxide is shared with all the nitrogen, oxygen and argon, because the latter molecules are always bumping into water vapor and carbon dioxide as they mix in the atmosphere. This effect makes the atmosphere act somewhat like a blanket that becomes thicker when amounts of water vapor, carbon dioxide and other ¿greenhouse gases,¿ such as methane and nitrous oxide, increase. The top of the blanket remains cold and continues to emit about the same amount of infrared to space but below the blanket it gets warmer because it is more difficult for the heat to rise to the top.</p>

<p>The heating effect of extra carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide and many other minor gases can be calculated with confidence based on the absorption properties that have been measured carefully in the laboratory. Currently, the total heating produced by the increases of all long-lived greenhouse gases (excluding water vapor) since preindustrial times is equal to about 1 percent of all solar radiation absorbed at the surface. The effect would be somewhat similar if the sun had started to shine 1 percent more brightly during the 20th century.</p>

<p>Water vapor is excluded from the above calculation because it is an intimate and highly variable part of the climate system itself in the form of clouds, rain, snow and other weather. The long-lived greenhouse gases, however, can be considered an external forcing clearly influenced by human action. Most climatologists expect that on average the atmosphere¿s water vapor content will increase in response to surface warming caused by the long-lived greenhouse gases, further accelerating the overall warming trend.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude, see how this has changed? First, global warming was just wrong - after your crude, scientifically illiterate claims are put to rest, now it&#39;s &quot;but what can we do?&quot;</p>

<p>I&#39;m going to word this in the following way.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s say We&#39;re driving towards a cliff at 75 mph, if we don&#39;t do something we&#39;re going to go over that cliff, the brakes we have are somewhat shot.</p>

<p>I suggest we pump the brakes and slow down a bit, maybe we can avoid a disaster - and my passenger says &quot;no point, we probably won&#39;t be able to stop anyway.&quot;</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the thing - all of the suggested strategies for dealing with climate change are <strong>things we should be doing anyway.</strong></p>

<p>We should be moving away from fossil fuels to more sustainable renewable energy.</p>

<p>We should be trying to reduce our environmental impact, we should be trying to reduce pollution. This &quot;alarmist&quot; smear you&#39;re spamming is literally directly from the fossil fuel industry, the same smears the Tabbco industry used to make it seem as if the scientists were lying about negative health effects.</p>

<p>You are being scammed dude - you are being scammed by people that care about literally nothing other than short term profits and protecting those profits from any sort of regulation or control.</p>

<p>It isn&#39;t the fossil fuel tyrants that are going to suffer when climate change starts to impact us - they&#39;ll be fine, they have the money to move away, it&#39;s everyone else that will suffer.</p>

<p>For the love of god wake the fuck up, stop letting yourself get scammed by these people because you&#39;re such a contrarian you feel the need to deny objective reality.</p>

<p>There are tens of <em>thousands</em> of scientists who disagree about this with reams of peer reviewed research that challenges the official alarmist conclusions. You don&#39;t hear about them because they are being stifled by the special interests that want to keep the gravy train going. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That it&#39;s all based on a &quot;gravy train&quot; is absolutely rediculous. First of all that&#39;s not how science works. Second of all the economics of that statement does not even work: The status quo is always the most lucrative model to support because the established players will always have more money. So if that&#39;s your basis for believing climate change deniers you are wrong headed there as well. If you think big windmill pays more than big oil you are quite literally tilting at windmills. </p>

<p>Still waiting on your own background in science to believe the 2% over the 98%.</p>

<p>You realize the exact opposite is what&#39;s happening, don&#39;t  you, or are you really that far out of touch? More people are learning the truth and your alarmist rhetoric has already become a mockery of itself. Maybe you should read a little more from different sources than the alarmist bandwagon of fear you blindly pray to. Sorry about that. </p>

<p>The fact that you&#39;re even willing to debate this is hilarious. If the science was right and you were right there would be no need for debate. The scientific method includes a very healthy dose of skepticism, and when credible peer reviewed evidence is presented, then you and your alarmist cohorts go to incredible lengths to re-write the data and change the dialogue. </p>

<p>You&#39;re fighting a losing battle that you&#39;ve already lost. Wake up. Subscribe to r/climateskeptics and maybe learn something that your  science liars aren&#39;t telling you. </p>
