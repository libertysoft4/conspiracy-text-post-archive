        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So I have a rather loose theory, hypothesis, whatever you want to call it, I was wondering if y&#39;all could help me tidy it up a bit, pull the pieces of my fleeting thought into something a little more coherent.</p>

<p>The gist of it is this: <em>spell</em>ing. Words, when broken down, have particular hidden meanings in them, often they invoke certain deities or archetypes. Having watched American Gods recently, the thought came to the fore of my mind as Wednesday, Woden, or Odin, is a lead character, it made me wonder how many other words have intricately woven meanings hidden inside of them.</p>

<p>I wonder if these words hold a certain power over our minds, led so easily astray, as they are by subtle symbology and meanings buried deep within our subconscious. Do we give power to the old gods with ever word we speak? Do the repetitions of certain phrases have an affect on the physical structure of our reality, or the very least, the consensus reality of our psychic projections as a species?</p>

<p>I apologise if this post lacks coherency, it&#39;s a bit of a run on thought to be honest, but it seems like an interesting topic of discussion.</p>

Sunday is the Lord&#39;s Day, except that many including the Quaker&#39;s think everyday is the Lord&#39;s Day.  Some&#39;s churches also refer to it as the 8th day.  Some do think that Sunday is now the new Sabbath, but they are wrong.  Jesus never said that.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok so speaking from experience; there are certainly linguistic coincidences in English and other languages. But if you&#39;re seeing meaning in phonemes or alphabets regularly it&#39;s likely a symptom of some mental illness. I used to be pretty big on numerology and reading between the lines of English. It&#39;s largely your mind thinking too conspiratorially.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Cop out.  Phonemes are arguably the single best link to linguistic mutation across culture that we have, given that most people in times past couldn&#39;t read.  And this is exactly what you see in language, and why the same names/concepts seem to transcend culture.  Without trying to be too Jordan Maxwell, here&#39;s the oos phoneme :  Zeus, Jesus, Dionysus, Horus, Tammuz.  Each of which represents the same archetype.   Similarly Set/Satan/Saturn/Shaitan.  These aren&#39;t fluke patterns.  They&#39;re far too consistent for that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I used to be pretty big on numerology..It&#39;s largely your mind thinking too conspiratorially.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Same complaint as above.  Number systems and the process of counting/arithmetic are consistent/repeatable/reversible symbolic mutation operations.  The invention of a counting system is a prerequisite for encoding language, which is probably why we see Hebrew encoded sans vowels in the same way.  No accident.  It&#39;s not conspiracy thinking but simple observation of how language evolves from symbol.  </p>
