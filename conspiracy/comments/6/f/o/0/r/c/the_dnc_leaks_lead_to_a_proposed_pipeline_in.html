<p><a href="https://youtu.be/1O3oSXChcdk">https://youtu.be/1O3oSXChcdk</a></p>

<p>I was told the Clinton email scandal and the associated events with <a href="http://dailycaller.com/2017/05/30/exclusive-attorney-files-lawsuit-in-seth-rich-murder-mystery/">Seth Rich</a>, murdered DNC staffer, <a href="http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/03/clinton-foundation-eric-braverman-115598">Eric Braverman</a>, Former Clinton foundation CEO,<a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/marc-turi-libyan-rebels-hillary-clinton-229115">Marc Turi</a>, the Clinton Foundation Arms dealer in Benghazi and Syria, were not as big a conspiracy as JFK and 9/11. </p>

<p>I would argue a conspiracy that exposes a plan to bring down three countries, has killed two world leaders, and has a body count in the millions if you count civilians in Iraq, Syria, and Lybia might actually be bigger than JFK and 9/11.</p>

<p>This whole story begins with the Bushs&#39; war in Iraq to dispose Saddam Hussein. This was the first chess piece in a corporate global war between the United States and Putin to control European energy markets. It&#39;s not about money, entirely, its about control of the world&#39;s largest energy market, the E.U.. It is a corporate war for control between the East and West. On one side Russia, Iran, and Syria are squaring off with the United States and Saudi Arabia over control of a pipeline through Iraq, Syria, and Turkey.</p>

<p>None of these events make sense by themselves until they are put in context with the rest of the events. </p>

<p>The events were exposed by a hacker named <a href="http://m.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/oct/12/guccifer-hacker-who-exposed-hillary-clinton-privat/">Guccifer</a> and the events around three people. Eric Braverman, Marc Turi, and Seth Rich. </p>

<p>Guccifer found an email from Sid Blumenthal to hillary with an address of <a href="mailto:HRC@ClintonMail.com">HRC@ClintonMail.com</a>. This event was innocuous enough until Trey Gowdy asked a simple question. &quot;What is this hrc email? Why don&#39;t you use a State Department email address?&quot;</p>

<h3>This is all about a pipeline of monumental geopolitical importance and the huge dollars brought in to Washington to get the State Department to rubber stamp questionable arms shipments.</h3>

<p>This pipeline ties together the war in Libya, the questionable chemical attack in Syria, the coup attempt in Turkey,  and the war in Iraq. All the loose strings in the Middle East make sense if they were a plan to build the Friendship pipeline through Iraq and Syria.  It also explains why Putin would risk war in Ukraine. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budapest_Memorandum_on_Security_Assurances">The Budapest Memorandum</a> agreed upon by Ukraine, the United States, Great Britain, and Russia was a memorandum where Ukraine relinquished Soviet era nuclear warheads in return a non aggression pact and a guarantee of protection from all the signatories of the pact. Russian aggression violated the Budapest Memorandum and could have brought the U.S and NATO against Russia in to a war under another president. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.securitycouncilreport.org/atf/cf/%7B65BFCF9B-6D27-4E9C-8CD3-CF6E4FF96FF9%7D/s_1994_1399.pdf">The Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances refers to three identical political agreements signed at the OSCE conference in Budapest, Hungary on 5 December 1994</a></p>

<p>It only makes sense if we understand how these pieces fit together. The billions of dollars, hundreds of billions of dollars and control of the largest energy market and population on earth, the E.U..</p>

<p>Three people stood in the way of this project. Not because they are against it,  but because they got caught up in the beurocratic wheels of government and might have exposed the plot through the incidental release of information. </p>

<p>Eric Braverman, the Clinton foundation CEO. Having concerns for the fiduciary practices of the Clinton foundation Eric Braverman left the organization and <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-10-22/meet-man-who-can-expose-real-hillary-clinton-scandal">&quot;conflicting reporting&quot;</a> stated he ran to the Russian embassy in New York. There are also reports he leaked something to the effect of &quot;follow the money&quot; to the media. </p>

<p>Marc Turi, the arms dealer coordinating the dispersal of arms in Libya and creating the supply chain to destabilize Syria and threaten Turkey. </p>

<p>Seth Rich, the man who brought the Clinton regime to a halt. Rich was an idealist supporting his belief in Bernie Sanders, but the powers that be could not allow the Sandernistas to get in the way of total control of Europe and the world energy market. I doubt Rich understood the implications of his release of the emails to Wikileaks. </p>

<p>While Seth didn&#39;t stop the plans for the Middle East he did cut hillary and bill and the Clinton machine out of the money. She had to be president to finish the years of work to make billions in political kickbacks and seal the Clinton dynasty&#39;s future once and for all as a power that would become the Rockefellers of the political age. </p>

<p>This is motive for murder. The election of hillary was key to making the rest possible and ensuring future was ruled by the Clintons. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Turkey’s <a href="http://aa.com.tr/en/info/infographic/2083">Anadolu News Agency, though government-run</a>, is providing remarkably clear and reliable diagrammatic descriptions of the current status of the U.S - and - fundamentalist - Sunni, versus Russia - and - Shia - and - NON - fundamentalist - Sunni, sides, in the current oil-and-gas war in the Middle East, for control over territory in Syria, for construction of oil-and-gas pipelines through Syria supplying fuel into the world’s largest energy-market: Europe. Russia is now the dominant supplier of both oil and gas, but its ally Iran is a Shiite gas-powerhouse that wants to share the market there, and Russia has no objection.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It not the oil that&#39;s necessarily important, that is pocket change to prop up dictators and fund corporate support to protect the pipeline. It is the means of transportation, the power of control of European energy. The ability to shut off the supply of energy to Europe, that is what&#39;s important. </p>

<p>Despite its strategic importance Putin attacked Crimea and threatened Ukraine to prevent NATO control of Russian gas pipelines that supply huge amounts of energy to Europe and support the Russian economy. Putin could never let that fall in to the hands of NATO. </p>

<p>The Russian attack on Ukraine and the proposed &quot;<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran-Iraq-Syria_pipeline">Friendship Pipeline</a>&quot; would allow russia to control the vast majority of European energy consumption. This is a battle to determine if Russia and Iran control the pipeline or if the United States and Saudi Arabia control the pipeline. This is the survival of the petrol dollar, the survival of the American economy. More importantly, the individuals who control these supply lines will become some of the most powerful people on the planet.</p>

<h3>When did Syria Come in to play...</h3>

<p>After the war in Libya, which was nothing more than the consolidation of power for France and England over Libyan <a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/dailychart/2011/03/libyas_water_supply">natural resources</a>. Not only does Libya supply sweet crude oil to many refineries in Europe that require Libyan oil to make gasoline due to their environmental policies, but Libya also has aquifers that supply much of North Africa with water. The Europeans don&#39;t care who controls Lybia or have any humanitarian concerns for the people, they just need to ensure the supply of oil and can consolidate control of the region latter. Gaddafi and his gold backed Dinar would have stabilized the region and African control of their economies. It would have also produced real competition for the dollar in the region. This could not happen. So two months after the DoD recognised Gaddafi&#39;s support against al&#39;Qaeda the war to depose and kill Gaddafi begins.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.foreignpolicyjournal.com/2016/01/06/new-hillary-emails-reveal-true-motive-for-libya-intervention/">Newly disclosed emails show that Libya’s plan to create a gold-backed currency to compete with the euro and dollar was a motive for NATO’s intervention.</a></p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Once the war in Lybia had removed Gaddofi from power the arms deal to supply Syrian rebels with Lybian weapons could begin. <a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/did-john-mccain-meet-with-abu-bakral-baghdadi-the-alleged-head-of-the-islamic-state-isis-isil-daesh/5498177">John McCain</a> was in contact with what would later become the heads of ISIS to begin a Syrian civil war. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Shortly after the mainstream media erupted in hysteria and neo-McCarthyistic attacks against former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn for having a routine conversation with the Russian Ambassador and for once having dinner with the President of Russia as part of an event, aging warmonger Senator John McCain recently announced that he had traveled illegally into Syria to meet with U.S. troops illegally stationed there as well as to meet with ISIS supporter and President of Turkey, Recep Tayip Erdogan.</p>

<p>McCain also met with the Saudi King Salman bin Abdulaziz and crown prince Sheikh Mohammad bin Zayed Al Nahyan of Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. In addition, McCain also met with Kurdish fighters on the ground in Syria.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Before we get in to the ideological war of McCain and hillary, Republican and Democrat, lets remember they both claim to be <a href="http://www.heritage.org/political-process/report/the-transformation-american-democracy-teddy-roosevelt-the-1912-election">progressives</a> and have much in common politically. </p>

<h3>Enter Marc Turi and Bengazi</h3>

<p>The attack in Bengazi actually began with a meeting between Chris Stevens and a diplomat from Turkey, which was one of the main backers of the Syrian rebels. Mark Turi worked with Stephens to move shipments of weapons designated for Qatar in to Syria through Turkey. Once Lybia was under control it was used as a shipping point to support the Syrian revolution. The arms shipments had been discovered and a rebel group supported by by Iranian Cuds force leader <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qasem_Soleimani">Qasem Suleymani</a> began an attack to stop the arms Shipments. This would implicate the Russians, Syrians, and Hezbollah as logistic support for the attack on the Benghazi annex to stop McCain&#39;s and hillary&#39;s arms shipments to Syria. </p>

U.S.-Approved Weapons Transfer Ended Up With Libyan Jihadis</a></p>

<p>By JAMES RISEN, MARK MAZZETTI and MICHAEL S. SCHMIDT
December 5, 2012</p>

<blockquote>
<p>WASHINGTON — The Obama administration secretly gave its blessing to arms shipments to Libyan rebels from Qatar last year, but American officials later grew alarmed as evidence grew that Qatar was turning some of the weapons over to Islamic militants, according to United States officials and foreign diplomats.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The arms shipments were not for humanitarian reasons, they weren&#39;t to stop a despotic regime, they were to consolidate an American controlled pipeline through Syria with a dictator that would support the construction and management of the pipeline. The shipments of arms were illegal by American law and international law. hillary had to hide her support of the shipments as Secretary of State to hide a clear violation of the law. Her emails from Sid Blumenthal released by Guccifer proved her involvement and began the ball rolling for congressional investigations in to the Clinton mail server. This is where the email scandal began. This is the trail of money Eric Braverman alludes to when he ran to the Russian embassy. Along with bill&#39;s pay schemes selling the influence of the State Department, this was the trail of money,  but this was the brass ring. The scam that would have them set up until their grand children&#39;s grand children were old.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When the Qaddafi regime was ousted, Belhadj took control of the Tripoli Military Council. In 2011, Belhadj met with anti-Assad “rebels” in Turkey to plan weapons shipments from Libya to Syria. As Mr. Kelley explains, in September 2012 the Times of London reported that “a Libyan ship ‘carrying the largest consignment of weapons for Syria . . . has docked in Turkey.’” According to that report:</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>The shipment reportedly weighed 400 tons and included SA-7 surface-to-air anti-craft missiles and rocket-propelled grenades. Those heavy weapons are most likely from Muammar Gaddafi’s stock of about 20,000 portable heat-seeking missiles — the bulk of them SA-7s — that the Libyan leader obtained from the former Eastern bloc. Reuters reports that Syrian rebels have been using those heavy weapons to shoot down Syrian helicopters and fighter jets. The ship’s captain was “a Libyan from Benghazi and the head of an organization called the Libyan National Council for Relief and Support,” which was presumably established by the new government.
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2012/10/25/was-syrian-weapons-shipment-factor-in-ambassadors-benghazi-visit.html">Fox News subsequently reported</a> that the ship, a Libyan-flagged vessel, Al-Entisar (The Victory), docked in the Turkish port of Iskenderun, only 35 miles from the Syrian border, on September 6, 2012. That was just five days before jihadists conducted the patently coordinated terrorist attack on the mysterious State Department and CIA compounds in Benghazi, killing four Americans including Stevens — who had been promoted to ambassador in May.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/cia-ops-finally-revealed-what-the-us-ambassador-in-benghazi-was-really-doing/5483957">CIA Ops Finally Revealed: What the US Ambassador in Benghazi was Really Doing</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>As was widely reported, Stevens originally arrived in Libya during the revolution aboard a Greek cargo ship carrying equipment and vehicles. His original task in Libya was to serve as the main interlocutor between the Obama administration and the rebels based in Benghazi. Stevens never abandoned that role, even after becoming ambassador, according to Klein.</p>

<p>Indeed, the New York Times reported in December 2012 that Stevens himself facilitated an application to the State Department for the sale of weapons filed by one Marc Turi, whom the Times’ describes as an “American arms merchant who had sought to provide weapons to Libya.”</p>

<p>The Times reported Turi’s first application was rejected in March 2011 but was approved two months later after he stated “only that he planned to ship arms worth more than $200 million to Qatar.” Qatar was Turkey’s partner in aiding the Syrian rebels.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>The Syrian Chemical Attack and the Red Line...</h3>

<p>The chemical attack during the obama administration had some unusually coincidental events. The Russians claimed that the chemistry was not Russian but American. The rumor of WMD shipped from Iraq to Syria before the Bush invasion is given credibility. This leaves us with two conclusions for the events that transpired, but they both managed to leave the American Intelligence Community in the same position. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Syria used sarin gas on the rebels for the psychological damage it inflicts on the enemy. </p></li>
<li><p>The American Intelligence Community caused a false flag in Syria to blame Assad and builds a collation of support to depose Assad and put a pro Saudi, pro Turkey puppet in the region. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Its not really important how it actually happened, I&#39;ll leave that to the historians, but either way for the United States the end result is the same, a military presence in Syria gains political and public support. The next domino in the pipeline is set to fall. The real question is does the domino fall east or west. </p>

<p>As <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/04/05/middleeast/syria-sarin-chemical-weapons-explainer/">CNN points out</a> the rebels do not have the infrastructure to build binary nerve agents, but McCain&#39;s support could have provided the chemicals required in the first chemical attack to get obama to declare the red line that he failed to enforce.  Fortunately obama folded like a cheap suit and was not willing to risk world war for a pipeline. We might consider thanking him for that failure. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.lrb.co.uk/v36/n08/seymour-m-hersh/the-red-line-and-the-rat-line">The Red Line and the Rat Line</a></p>

<p>Seymour M. Hersh on Obama, Erdoğan and the Syrian rebels</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Obama’s change of mind had its origins at Porton Down, the defence laboratory in Wiltshire. British intelligence had obtained a sample of the sarin used in the 21 August attack and analysis demonstrated that the gas used didn’t match the batches known to exist in the Syrian army’s chemical weapons arsenal.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Russian knew this, they also knew  that while obama folded, hillary would risk world war for the power gained from the pipeline through Syria.</p>

<h3>McCain visits Syria and Trump is drawn in to the Chemical Red Line.</h3>

<p>This time they use chlorine gas. Something the rebels could manufacture and Assad is know to possess. Once again, in the larger picture it is not important who conducted the attack,  however it could draw the United States in to the Syrian Civil War again. Trump increases air strikes, arms the opposition, including the Kurds, gets congressional approval for arms and support, and the battle for Syria enters phase 2 and 3. Syria crumbles under civil war. </p>

<p>The Syrian Chemical Attack did not make sense when Assad had control of the Battle Field. The conventional arms Assad was using were far more devastating than a small chemical attack and it would only give the United States an excuse to intervene in the Syrian civil war with public support. There was no strategic reason for Assad to use chemical weapons, his action brought American forces in direct opposition to Russian and Iranian forces. </p>

<p>Strangely the chemical attack comes, once again, shortly after John McCain visits the region. <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2017-04-06/evidence-calls-western-narrative-about-syrian-chemical-incident-question">McCain meets with radical jihadists</a> in the end of May and the chemical attack occurs in August</p>

<ol>
<li><p>There are plenty of military targets to focus attention on. </p></li>
<li><p>Conventional weapons and explosives are just as effective, especially with air support.</p></li>
<li><p>Why bring additional support for the rebels? A chemical attack will just bring in the United States and NATO or UN dogooders to provide military support for the rebels.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I&#39;m sure there are more reasons, but these are glaringly obvious. </p>

<p>The United States needs an intervention and a support group to consolidate power for the removal of Assad. What are the objectives worth fighting for in Syria?</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Russia will fight for the deep water port in Syria. Russia will fight to keep their naval base in <a href="http://foreignpolicy.com/2015/10/02/putins-mediterranean-power-play-in-syria-navy-tartus-fleet/">Tartus</a>. Are we willing to go to war with Russia over 57 dead kids because Russia will go to war for that port. I hate to be harsh, but that&#39;s the reality of the situation. </p></li>
<li><p>This is not a humanitarian fight. Beyond Russia&#39;s warm water Mediterranean port the conflict in Syria is over a <a href="http://www.strategic-culture.org/news/2016/10/24/oil-gas-war-over-syria-maps.html">pipeline</a>. Russia and Iran want a pipeline through Syria to supply natural gas to Europe. Russia is currently supplying much of Europe&#39;s energy needs from pipelines running through Ukraine. Through the second term of the obama administration until now Russia has been consolidating a position to strengthen control over Ukraine and Syria with the European energy market in their sights. Russia and their allies will be the dominant suppliers of all petrochemical energy in Europe. </p></li>
</ol>

<h3>Enter Seth Rich. Why was the murder of Seth Rich so important?</h3>

<p>First off, do not think this only leads to the DNC deep state. The progressive wing of the Republicans are in this up to their necks. The Wikileaks only exposed hillary and her crimes. The failure of the Clinton machine to take the White House destroyed the Clinton political machine, but did not stop the overall objectives for energy dominance. That is why it&#39;s imperative hillary is charged and tried in a court of law. The only way to expose the cabal is through her prosecution. If hillary avoids prosecution the plan will continue</p>

<p>The hillary server obviously was important to unravel what happened in Benghazi, but beyond the election what did the release of the DNC and John Podesta&#39;s emails  really do? </p>

<p>Ignoring how the emails were released, the content posed a real threat to hillary&#39;s desires for president. Her power base, John Podesta, James Clapper, Andrew McCabe, and the rest of the DNC deep state poised to profit from hillary&#39;s ascension to the presidency were stopped, and more importantly, completely surprised by the almost instant loss of power. </p>

<p>The Clinton deep state was exposed for the corrupt political creatures they are. It was rarely mentioned by the MSM that there was a distinct lack of policy in the Clinton/Podesta emails. The emails were full of political wrangling and social communication, but very little about the people they claim to care so much about. It did show the political machine for what it was. </p>

<p>The DNC email exposed the corruption that cheated Bernie Sanders out of a fair primary election, and was likely the motive for the release of the emails. The real problem was quite possibly the release of John Podesta&#39;s emails. </p>

<p>I am of the belief that there was some fairly creepy stuff in the Podesta emails. I also didn&#39;t come up with every excuse under the sun to prove Podesta didn&#39;t actually mean what he wrote. Beyond the creepiness, however, was some pretty damming political inside baseball. Should the emails mean what some have read in to them there was clearly grounds for murder. More importantly it proved the catalyst for change in America crushing the years of work the Clinton machine had put in to building a political empire. </p>

<p>It always struck me as a coordinated attack by people inside the system that would go to any lengths to stop fundamental change of the country and the Clinton empire. I know ideologues either love or hate the idea of Clinton, but very few actually understand the global implications of the failure of hillary Clinton. </p>

<h3>Enter Eric Braverman</h3>

<h3>Why should hillary be prosecuted now that the election is over?</h3>

<p>While the usefulness of the hillary machine has, I hope, been forever crippled the money behind the international plans that put this all in motion will find a new figure head to advance their agenda. Only by decisive prosecution will we weed out the corruption that built the Clinton machine.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>According to Conservative Daily News, it was also speculated that like Edward Snowden, Eric Braverman had also sought political asylum in New York’s Russian Embassy. And to add more gravity to the rumor, it was also said that the Russian Embassy never rebuked the story.</p>

<p>The major history of the former Clinton Foundation CEO went back to the year 2013. This was when former First Daughter Chelsea Clinton appointed Braverman as the CEO of the Clinton Foundation.</p>

<p>This report from investmentwatchblog.com claims that Braverman is actually in Protective Custody with the FBI, in exchange for testimony against Clinton.</p>

<p>Then Wikileaks dropped a bomb. Shortly before Braverman left the foundation John Podesta identified Braverman as a leak in the organization. The Clinton Foundation is now exposed for questionable feduciary practices by internal memos and Braverman had been identified by Podesta as the rat who told the media to &quot;follow the money.&quot; </p>

<p>It looks as if Braverman ran, and as the CEO of the Clinton Foundation and may have left with a life insurance folder like Weiner. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>We have written frequently about the internal Clinton Foundation power struggle between Chelsea Clinton and Doug Band over the previous couple of weeks (see <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-10-10/mother-daughter-podesta-email-reveals-spoiled-brat-chelsea-almost-caused-foundation-">here</a>,<a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-10-17/backstabbing-spoiled-brat-chelsea-lists-her-grievances-against-doug-band-and-justin-">here</a> and <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-10-20/another-day-another-doug-band-meltdown-over-conflict-interest-policy">here</a> ).  It all started back in 2011 when, as Chelsea started to take a more senior role at the Clinton Foundation, she became increasingly concerned about an internal audit that exposed glaring conflicts of interest throughout the Foundation with an emphasis on Doug Band and his company, Teneo, who she thought had inappropriately sought favors from the State Department during Hillary&#39;s tenure as Secretary of State.  A <a href="http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/03/clinton-foundation-eric-braverman-115598">Politico</a> article from March 2015, summarized Chelsea&#39;s rise at the Foundation and how it threatened some long-time Clinton allies who had grown quite accustomed to the status quo.</p>

<h2>How does Eric Braverman&#39;s disappearance tie in with the death or disappearance of Marc Turi?</h2>

<p>This is purely speculation that either man are linked, but Braverman, reasonably could have left with financial records. In reality, what would be important enough to bring down the Clinton political machine and possibly obama&#39;s legacy. Proving they did in fact fund the group that became ISIS thinking they were rebels that were going to over throw Assad. Whatever their motivations, they lied to the American people, they got Americans killed, and they committed a crime by supplying terrorist with weapons. </p>

<h2>Who has the evidence, the actual correspondence with hillary, the emails toxic enough to get the DOJ to stand down on an international arms trafficing case?</h2>

<h3>Enter Marc Turi</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>Marc Turi, the Phoenix, AZ-based arms dealer also saw himself being set-up by the Clintons to take the fall and he went to Fox News with the story but soon disappeared and is currently presumed dead.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After threatening to release emails in federal court implicating hillary in the Benghazi arms trade the DOJ dropped all charges against Marc Turi. An associate of Turi alleges that the documents that would have to be released under discovery to the defense would have implicated hillary and obama in illegal arms deals that moved arms through Benghazi Libya to arm Syrian rebels that later became ISIS. </p>

<p>Arms dealer had threatened to expose Hillary Clinton’s talks about arming anti-Qadhafi rebels.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/arizona-investigations/2016/11/20/mysterious-saga-arizona-arms-dealer/94023174/">Great Biographical Information about Marc Turi.</a></h3>

<p>Well worth the read. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Mr. Turi has said the Obama administration, and thus Mrs. Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee and the prime mover of NATO intervention in Libya, blessed the moves he made to get rifles, anti-tank rockets, explosives and machine guns into the hands of anti-Moammar Gadhafi fighters.</p>

<p>The backdrop to Gadhafi’s fall is Benghazi, where four Americans, including the U.S. ambassador, were killed by terrorists on Sept. 11, 2012.</p>

<p>Mr. Turi’s lawyer, Jean-Jacques Cabou of the Perkins Coie law firm, has argued in court that among the bounty of Clinton emails released by the government are discussions between the then-Secretary of State Clinton and others about arms for Libyan rebels</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While the Clinton email server, the murder of Seth Rich, and the events, whatever they might be, surrounding Eric Braverman and Marc Turi are seemingly unrelated to a pipeline in Syria they did create the trail of breadcrumbs that lead directly from the invasion of Iraq too a &quot;NATO&quot; conquest in Libya to Syria. The players are undoubtedly <a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/bogus-intelligence-the-same-officials-who-pushed-the-iraq-war-are-now-stirring-up-anti-russia-hysteria/5567087">Donald Rumsfeld under Bush, hillary and Clapper</a> under obama and now it&#39;s beginning under Trump with the escalation in Syria currently taking place. The money behind the politics will just find a new figure head if we don&#39;t expose these lies and hold those responsible to account for their actions. This will also reveal a number of other crimes that are signs of deep seated corruption in the political system. It will only be exposed with stiff punishments and long terms in federal prison. </p>

<p>I know the prevalent opinion is hillary lost why bother trying to convict her of a crime, but that is the only way to expose the players in this scheme. I, in fact, agree that the pipeline is of critical importance to national security, but the political class has to make their case to the American public. I do not approve of being lied to. The recent history of the nation would have been very different if the political class had told the truth to the people. They need to go to jail, and not just a slap on the wrist, but a life sentence, to make the point that we will not tolerate being lied too. </p>

<p>I for one am tired of having my tax dollars disrespected and frittered away to support politically motivated lies directing the men and women in the military in to harms way to avoid a difficult truth. This must stop. The political leaders must be held to account by the people or the lies will not quit. </p>
