    <div class="md"><p>If I were earning that much I wouldn&#39;t have any problem paying a slightly higher rate of tax, but then I&#39;m not a greedy cunt. As it stands there are nurses using food banks and May wants to <em>cut taxes for the wealthy</em> while <a href="http://www.itv.com/news/2017-06-03/theresa-may-questioned-on-tax-plans/">increasing tax herself, for <em>everyone</em></a>, including those who already can&#39;t make ends meet.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m guessing you haven&#39;t suffered the ravages of austerity yourself, they are literally killing poor families already so the wealthy can maintain this state of affairs.  </p>

<p>in any case...not really. its called career planning. called learning skills &amp; putting in effort. achieving success isn&#39;t some magical thing. sure we might not all become (((elite))) but nothing stopping you achieving relative success (and more depending on how risk inclined / entrepreneurial you are)</p>

<p>besides, can&#39;t be a TEM when family wealth is already greater than that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let me explain so you don&#39;t think I&#39;m being anti-ambition:
The system is rigged beyond your imagination
if you think it&#39;s the poor stealing from the rich.
I guarantee you it&#39;s waaay more the other way round.</p>

<p>Corporations/bankers/establishment leech from the poor.
Socialism for the rich (crony capitalism) 
gives corporations subsidies (free tax money)
despite being insanely successful already.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not about ambition.
I&#39;m very much in favor of helping small and medium businesses but big corporations take advantage of us.</p>

<p>The working/middle classes generate almost all wealth in the country
and corporations exploit that wealth,
pay low wages, dodge taxes, receive subsidies,
rig democracy by bribing congress and ghost-writing our laws,
moving jobs abroad so their corporate jobs go to the most
poor/desparate workers willing to work hard shitty jobs for as low as possible, etc.</p>

<p>The establishment are the scum of the earth 
and it consists of wall street, elite bankers, corporations,
and possibly some royalty and the Vatican if you go down that rabbit hole.</p>

<p>I&#39;m definitely an ambitious person and want
what&#39;s best for small/medium businesses who play by the rules
rather than unethical corporations.</p>

<p>The top 5% aren&#39;t going to be small/medium businesses.
To give perspective on how rigged the economy is,
there are I think $13 trillion of money abroad in tax havens
that the elite just sit their asses on.</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s great to be ambitious whether it&#39;s in the private (e.g. business) or public sector 
but at the same time I want our taxes to go towards services
that benefit US, the people.
Right now it&#39;s a pathway for cash flow to the elites
at our expense.
I want the working/middle classes to get their tax&#39;s money&#39;s worth
(not get ripped off) and have an ethical safety net.</p>

<p>Taxation isn&#39;t theft, it&#39;s the way it&#39;s implemented
that determines if there&#39;s theft.</p>

<p>E.g. if taxes went purely to help the people,
e.g. health care, transport (you may need s train to get to work),
higher education (many jobs require it),
energy, science/tech, etc.
then there would be less poverty and the tax payer and worker
is compensated fairly for contributing to the economy
rather than allowing corporations to sit on money
and reduce circulation when they dodge tax and pay low wages.</p>

<p>I also don&#39;t want the military industrial complex to profit
off war from our taxes. I don&#39;t want to contribute to warmongers.
But I sure as hell would be willing to pay for healthcare
if it&#39;s nationalized (not having big pharma and insurance companies having
too large a piece of the profit pie at our expense).</p>

<p>If I was rich, I absolutely would have the same mindset.
I&#39;m willing to help those who need it,
but fuck those corporations who facilitate economic slavery.
In fact, my business would thrive under a more fair
taxation system as there would be less poverty and thus
more customers that can afford my products.
Conservativism (branches: globalist NEOliberalism, NEOconservativism, unregulated free market capitalism, etc.)
is just there for the establishment to conserve a low waged population (economic slavery)
through rigged legislature.</p>

<p>Nothing wrong with being ambitious but
I don&#39;t want the tax payer/workers to be ripped off.
Not saying wealth should be distributed completely evenly
(some deserve more pay than others)
but certainly we need more opportunities
(cheaper travel, free/cheap higher education to get qualifications,
cheaper energy, cheaper uncorrupted healthcare, etc.)
in order to pull people out of poverty indefinitely.</p>

<p>We don&#39;t have to have a dog-eat-dog world.
It&#39;s just been socially engineered this way by the establishment.</p>
