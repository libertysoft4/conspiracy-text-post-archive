        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Whether you&#39;re a fan of Debbie Lusignan&#39;s commentary or not, she put together a very in-depth blog in real-time, state-by-state, chronicling massive amounts of election fraud. Everything&#39;s covered;</p>

<p>-Voter Roll Purging (State by state... see Brooklyn alone, where over 125,000 people were seemingly kicked off the rolls. This nationwide phenomenon was almost entirely exclusive to potential Sanders voters.)</p>

<p>-Unsolicited Party Affiliation Switching (Lifelong Dems being switched to Lib, Repub, or Independent in closed primaries by the thousands. In one of the more eggregious primaries, AZ, their SOS even testified under oath that this had occured in unprecedented numbers. As above, this phenomenon was almost entirely exclusive to Sanders voters.)</p>

<p>-Caucus Rigging (The shenanigans in Iowa and especially NV should have caused more outrage than they did.)</p>

<p>-Absentee Ballot Stuffing (See Wyoming and Montanta for extreme examples of this.)</p>

<p>-Unparalleled Precinct Slashing (This occurred in many states with once again AZ being a prime example. Polling locations were cut to record lows. Lines stretched into the thousands and wait times were documented to be upwards of 4-6 hours in certain counties.)</p>

<p>-Auditing Anomolies (See the results and testimony before the Election Board following the Chicago micro-audit.)</p>

<p>Historic Exit Poll Discrepancies (In 12 states, the discrepancies were well outside of the margin of error and in some cases in the double-digits. These discrepancies were almost entirely exclusive to the Sanders/Clinton race, with everything else matching up within the margin of error as expected. Look at the difference between the exit polls in the Republican Primary versus the Democratic... it&#39;s night and day. Also, I&#39;d be remiss if I didn&#39;t mention that after the exit poll anamolies started to gain serious traction, they were eliminated in each state for the remainder of the primary. Independent exit polls were conducted in the states where official ones were cancelled and often showed massive discrepancies in regards to the official outcome... see CA.)</p>

<p>-Voter Database Breaches (This happened during a few key points pre-primary and during; the AZ breach being the most significant. Though unproven, many election integrity activists theorize that this is the means in which probable Sanders voters were unmasked and targeted for roll purges and affiliation switches.)</p>

<p>-Electronic Voting Machines (Ever since HBO&#39;s Hacking Democracy expose aired and bolstered recently by the work of Bev Harris at blackboxvoting dot org, the continued use of electronic voting machines, many of which have been banned in Europe at this point, is highly irresponsible. These machines have proven to be susceptible to remote hacking and provide no paper trail. In fact, there is proprietary software built into the machines themselves with the sole purpose of fractionally weighting the votes to meet a predetermined outcome. See Bev Harris&#39; Fraction Magic mini-doc on youtube to see this exposed in real time. Whether or not this exploitiation was employed is up for debate, but by design this software leaves no evidentiary paper trail, making confirmation one way or the other next to impossible.</p>

<p>Then there is the outright underhandedness. While not necessarily fraud, ethics and fairness do come into serious question.</p>

<p>-Everything in the Wikileaks DNC and Podesta dumps. (This has all been thoroughly covered here.)</p>

<p>-Historically Minimal Debate Schedule (DNC originally only sanctioned 6 debates. Sanders/Clinton ended up having 9, but compare that to 08&#39; when Clinton/Obama faced off 26 times.)</p>

<p>-Near Media Blackout for Sanders during 2015 and into 2016. (In terms of minutes of pre-primary MSN news coverage an estimated 327 minutes went to Trump, 121 minutes to Clinton, and a mere 20 minutes for Sanders despite his surging momentum.)</p>

<p>-Media Bias (To say that the MSM wasn&#39;t in the tank for Clinton would be the understatement of the year. See The Washington Compost&#39;s 16 hit pieces they ran in one day leading up to Super Tuesday II. Not to mention the media and pundit collusion well documented in the Wikileaks dumps.)</p>

<p>-Closed Primaries (Despite 42% of the nation being registered Indies, the duopoly remains king. Many of the state caucuses and primaries excluded participation from the largest voting block in America. Coincidentally, left and even some right leaning Independents were far more likely to support Sanders than Clinton... go figure. In many states, first time registrants and those who wished to switch party affilation were required to do so months before voting took place. Naive first time voter were often victim to these regulations; again a youth block that would have overwhelmingly voted for Sanders. In NY for example, this was required months and months before voting took place, even before the first televised debates during which Sanders was experiencing a near media blackout. States that held &quot;open&quot; primaries were riddled with provisional ballot fuckery; see CA.</p>

<p>-Super Delegates (The fact that we willfully accept the notion that the vote of indivduals in positions of power count for much more than ours is baffling to me. It&#39;s this entirely undemocratic process that saw Clinton walk away with the same amount of pledged delegates as Sanders in a state like Wyoming that healthily won; with SD&#39;s included, Clinton walked away from that state, in a losing effort, with an 11 to 7 delegate advantage. Though this ties into media bias, it&#39;s worth mentioning that in nearly all MSM coverage, SD&#39;s were lumped in with pledged delegates whenever totals were presented to the public, even though SD&#39;s didn&#39;t cast their votes until the convention. To new and low-information constituents, this deceptive reporting gave the impression that Clinton&#39;s lead was always more significant than it actually was; this was done for the seemingly sole purpose of demoralizing the Sanders voting block and stifle upward momentum. As Al Franken pointed out, he felt that due to his political experience he knew what was best for his constituents and would cast his SD vote for Clinton despite his state going for Sanders. Franken was just one of many Reps and Senators that gave the middle finger to the will of their constituency.</p>

<p>-Rallies (Though this is more of a speculative side topic, it can&#39;t be ignored. From August 15&#39; through June of 16&#39;, even when Sanders had no delegate path to victory, his rallies were attended by hundreds of thousands of indivuals, often filling stadiums to maximum capacity. In contrast, HRC could barely fill a broom closet, let alone a high school gymnasium. Sure, she had a handful of decent turnouts early on, but those number dwindled as the primary carried on, while Sanders&#39; numbers surged in every conceivable way. In one her final rallies in L.A., there were more people protesting outside than HRC supporters inside. Looking at the gross disparity here, something just doesn&#39;t pass the smell test.</p>

<p>TL;DR - There was election fraud during the 2016 Democratic Primary, likely massive, if not an outright coup.</p>

<p>Everything I&#39;ve mentioned here and much much more can be found here with sources attached to anything and everything.</p>

<p>You seem to think if you make a really long list it will cover up that it&#39;s incredibly weak and many are outright false. Hillary won because black people didn&#39;t want to vote for Bernie, that&#39;s pretty much all there was to it.</p>

<p>So how do you explain all the errors in GOP controlled states? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Caucuses are run by the parties. So the Democratic caucus in a state is run by the Democratic party. Even in heavily Republican states. </p>

<p>The delegate process (for delegates from both caucus and primary states) is run by the party. In some states, the party may disregard voters&#39; selection of delegates or selected delegates may vote for any candidate at the state or national convention. </p>

<p>The Democratic party controls its voter rolls. In closed primary states and caucus states this means they determine who can vote in the primary. They would be perfectly capable of purging likely Sanders voters from their voter roles (I was purged, likely because my age made me a likely Sanders voter). </p>

<p>The Democratic party had a strong influence on voters receiving accurate information about provisional ballots. This lead to people believing that they could not vote when they could or made it more difficult for people to receive provisional ballots. They are where many voters go to for finding a polling location. They have the ability to misdirect people to the wrong polling station, where their vote will go uncounted. </p>

<p>The Democratic party has control of Super delegates, even in states where they have little influence. They also have the power to purge half of the delegates in certain states that break Democratic party bylaws <em>at their discretion</em>. This includes conservative states. </p>

<p>On top of this, many poll workers are party members.</p>

<p>2nd Closed primaries are based on what you party register as which is controlled by the states that have closed primaries not by the party.</p>

<p>3rd Provisional Ballots would be given at the polling station and not by the political party. The states are also responsible for ensuring the voters know what district they are in and where the voting locations is located which should be given at the time of registration.</p>

<p>Why do you ever only focus on corruption in the DNC? </p>

<p>Nobody ever talks about how Ron Paul had the nomination stolen from him in 2012 by the GOO, or how Trump was catapulted to the spotlight in 2015-2016 by the media, securing HIM the nomination from Rand Paul?</p>

<p>It&#39;s like...some of you actually think this is the first election where fraud was committed? And you&#39;re gonna be chasing this fucking DNC goose for 4 years while Trump shits all over our civil liberties..</p>

<p>The GOP is just as bad as the DNC. Cmon.....</p>

I&#39;d be lying if I said I wasn&#39;t happy waking up every morning to Trump as our president instead of that CUNT. Dont confuse me with one of those puppets from T_D though.</p>

<p>Ron Paul is the only candidate that hasn&#39;t changed his tune.  But who knows what he would have done had he gotten elected president.  TPTB can be pretty damn persuasive I&#39;d bet.</p>

<p>Honestly, I&#39;m starting to believe that Obama had every intention on doing some of things he campaigned on but once he got into office he was shown that this country is run by people in the shadows.  Presidents come and go, policy hasn&#39;t changed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bernie changed his tune only with respect to the DNC nominee, which I am comfortable waving away as motivated by threat and application of force. You may not be comfortable with that, and I respect you if that&#39;s how you feel.</p>

<p>I see Trump escalating the military industrial complex and empowering corporations, so he&#39;s (in my opinion and according to my standards) more of the same.</p>

<p>Obama campaigned on platitudes and supported the military industrial complex and corporations just like the Bush family and Bill Clinton. Hope and change without any specific ideas for how to fix things and a total failure at one of his most reiterated campaign promises to stop use of Guantanamo Bay as a detention facility. He barely even detailed any of his other ideas and fought against occupy and against the pipeline protests tooth and nail.</p>

<p>You&#39;re right, though, that I am excessively dismissive of Trump support, and I apologize for that. I think it stems from the fact that I hoped he would satisfy my few libertarian leanings especially in terms of reducing military and encouraging more States rights. Thus far he seems to just want to keep the worst parts of Obamacare, ramp up war in the Middle East, and tweet insults to keep the less informed members of his base excited about him.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t mean that to be insulting or targeted at anyone here, I just don&#39;t see any positive direction from any of his actions. He didn&#39;t even lock the Clintons up, which was the main thing I wanted from him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump was always a big military guy so his backing of the MIC doesn&#39;t surprise me.  I think Guantanamo was one of those things that Obama probably <em>did</em> want what he campaigned on but wasn&#39;t allowed to follow through with by TPTB.</p>

<p>Trump <em>seems like</em> he&#39;s pulling us away from the globalist agenda for this country.  That&#39;s a good thing to me.</p>

<p>Another Clinton investigation has opened.  Child traffickers have been rolled up and, some more important people have been arrested on CP charges.  I think some of the law and order he promised is coming.</p>

<p>I get that he&#39;s not everything to everyone and that he&#39;s not going to be the savior of our Republic that we hoped for and desperately need but, he&#39;s also not the next Hitler that MSM paints him as.</p>

<p>He voted for hunting down Osama bin Laden, which was the only viable political position after the WTC attacks if you wanted the American people to continue to elect you. He voted against the Iraq war.</p>

<p>This is an example bill used to fund the war that he voted yes on.  </p>

<p>6/26/08 HR 2642 Iraq and Afghanistan War Funding, Unemployment Benefits Extension, and GI Bill
Concurrence Vote Passed - Senate (92 - 6)  Yea</p>

<p>If you vote down a GI bill or unemployment, you&#39;re going to have a bad time.</p>

<p>His record is imperfect, for sure, but I think that a little slack can be granted for his dedication to the American people when it comes to domestic policy.

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Why do you ever only focus on corruption in the DNC?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because Wikileaks gave us the evidence for this. We didn&#39;t get that with Ron Paul.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Nobody ever talks about how Ron Paul had the nomination stolen from him in 2012</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If I were emperor for a day, I&#39;d have the entirety of the DNC and GOP beheaded and have their heads put on pikes because of 2012/2016. They are traitors and deserve to be treated as such. Tragically, no solid evidence got to gain any traction, so instead I&#39;ll have to settle with starting with the DNC equivalent.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Trump was catapulted to the spotlight in 2015-2016 by the media</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Wikileak emails actually revealed that happened because of the DNC colluding with Hillary and her pushing the idea that they should focus on Trump because of how easy she thought it would be to beat him in the general election. It&#39;s a conspiracy, just not from the GOP. Also humorously ironic.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>some of you actually think this is the first election where fraud was committed?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, just the first one where we have solid evidence that the system is rigged, maybe you&#39;d be better off with dropping the &quot;you guys are so biased&quot; bullshit and get behind the push to hold them accountable? As soon as you find the evidence that the GOP is doing it too, and I guarantee you they are, I&#39;ll be right there with you. I want those fuckers to burn just as bad as I want the DNC to.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And you&#39;re gonna be chasing this fucking DNC goose for 4 years </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This comes across like partisan bullshit. Do you really not see a difference between 2012, where all the evidence was anecdotal and circumstantial and there was no avenue to realistically pursue a course of justice, and 2016, where Wikileaks dropped massive amounts of emails proving it, which even the DNC admits are real?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The GOP is just as bad as the DNC. Cmon.....</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which, due to the circumstances at hand, isn&#39;t relevant right now.</p>

<p>I always just thought that he viewed Trump and the ideals that he espoused as dangerous and basically took one for the team.  Sanders is more and more popular every day and it&#39;s likely, if the Democrats learned anything, that he will be the next nominee.  If they attempt Clinton again then... it will pretty much kill the party.</p>

<p>-Closed Primaries (Despite 42% of the nation being registered Indies, the duopoly remains king. Many of the state caucuses and primaries excluded participation from the largest voting block in America. Coincidentally, left and even some right leaning Independents were far more likely to support Sanders than Clinton... go figure. In many states, first time registrants and those who wished to switch party affilation were required to do so months before voting took place. Naive first time voter were often victim to these regulations; again a youth block that would have overwhelmingly voted for Sanders. In NY for example, this was required months and months before voting took place, even before the first televised debates during which Sanders was experiencing a near media blackout. States that held &quot;open&quot; primaries were riddled with provisional ballot fuckery; see CA.</p>

<p>This was rampant.  my brother was told to go somewhere other than his poll, and had to fill out a provisional ballot.  Another sibling wanted to exchange their mail-in dem ballot for a dem ballot and was given a provisional only.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong, I am definitely one of those people that think the federal government does have too much power, but I refuse to believe that state governments care about their people anymore, and I think the federal government should be able
to prevent state governments from oppressing their own people, because at the end of the day, the people win and that is what matters most.</p>

That exciting a lot of people both young and old.  Here&#39;s the problem, Democratic voters wanted to vote for Obama a third time.

    <div class="md"><p>The DNC primary was rigged because state run primaries, oftentimes controlled entirely by Republicans, sometimes had problems with alleged voter suppression.</p>

<p>Because exit polls(which did not meet the standards of exit polls traditionally used to detect election fraud, as explicitly stated by the people conducting said exit polls) sometimes showed a discrepancy outside the margin of error. Where <strong>even if you completely ignored the results of the primary and allocated delegates purely via the results of exit polling, Clinton would still have comfortably won the pledged delegate count</strong>.</p>

<p>Because the media didn&#39;t cover the guy who never at any point in the entire primary looked like he was going to actually win from an objective point of view. They didn&#39;t cover a guy down by more than triple the amount of delegates ever made up in a primary, I wonder why??</p>

<p>There are a couple of other things, but I think it&#39;s kinda cute that you brought up Nevada when <strong>the sole and singular reason why Bernie lost Nevada was because a large amount of his delegates didn&#39;t even bother to show up to the final convention to vote for him</strong>. But that&#39;s somehow Clinton&#39;s fault.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its really funny to me that people act as if this shit didnt happen because she didn&#39;t win, the DNC rigging is the reason we have Trump instead of Bernie.  </p>

<p>I totally get the non paid posters opinions that Trump is a piece of shit, of fucking course he is.  The left media has done an amazing job using Russia/alt-right as a boogeyman to cover for their unbelievably illegal and treasonist acts against this country to subvert a grassroots movement against a person that led virtually every head to head poll against the guy they claim to hate.</p>

<p>If TPTB were actually out for our best interests we would be hearing from Bernie instead of Clinton right now about what went wrong.  The system is totally fucked as the real people that post here know, seeing them scramble is cathartic in a way but we really can&#39;t dwell.</p>

<p>The left and right are equally as awful and we have to read between the lines as best we can with shills from both sides trying to destroy the narrative of the other.  I originally scoffed at posts saying that love for eachother and our place in the universe is what will conquer all, I am now of the opinion that it is the only hope we have.  The universe and very fact we exist is infinitely more important than lashing out at paid protesters whose only purpose is to force people to pick a side.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s ok to dislike both trump and clinton, they are both bought out by corporate interests that hate the, &quot;everyday man.&quot;  It is reflected in everything they both do.  </p>

<p>We win when the world rises above the bullshit that everyone is being fed and pity TPTB instead of having abject hatred.  It starts with communities like this informing the everyday person that life doesnt begin and end with whatever the fuck you read in the news, left or right.  </p>

<p>I have been very angry for a long time about virtually everything, I&#39;m going to do my best to channel my energy more positively and I hope others will do the same.  </p>

Whenever the dnc primary subject comes up people downplay it by immediately bringing up how Hilary won by millions of votes and that it would be impossible to fake that many votes,  but  they ignore every other sketchy thing set up from the beginning of the process that would eliminate the need to fake a few million votes. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve heard this before but not from liberals. This sounds like a bernie bro post. Not everyone wanted Bernie just the socialist young people who are communists just like Trump supporters.</p>

<p>I hope you&#39;re enjoying Trump and you can enjoy a fascist wing communist America. I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll fit right in.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would urge some caution here and not conflate &quot;the will of the people&quot; with &quot;the will of The People&quot;. The latter is a term used to express the citizen of a nation. The former, as used in this context refers to voluntary members of a particular political party. The DNC is a private organization and it can literally nominate anyone it wants as canditate for POTUS. </p>

<p>The only possible brow back is potential loss of members.</p>

<p>This is not a problem for America. It is a problem within the private organazation that is the DNC. Lets not forget that the two are not synonymous. </p>

<p>Why do you ever only focus on corruption in the DNC? </p>

<p>Nobody ever talks about how Ron Paul had the nomination stolen from him in 2012 by the GOO, or how Trump was catapulted to the spotlight in 2015-2016 by the media, securing HIM the nomination from Rand Paul?</p>

<p>It&#39;s like...some of you actually think this is the first election where fraud was committed? And you&#39;re gonna be chasing this fucking DNC goose for 4 years while Trump shits all over our civil liberties..</p>

<p>The GOP is just as bad as the DNC. Cmon.....</p>
