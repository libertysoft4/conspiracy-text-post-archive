        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hello. I would like to present  to you this admittedly circumstantial evidence and you tell me what you think of it. Sound good? We&#39;re going to take a trip down the rabbit hole.</p>

<p>Go to <a href="https://www.google.com/earth/">Google Earth</a> and search for &quot;I, pet goat II&quot;</p>

<p>You should end up roughly at this location.</p>

<p><a href="https://earth.google.com/web/@46.2355997,6.0553345,449.29338018a,703.79478435d,35y,0h,45t,0r/data=ClEaTxJJCiUweDQ3OGM2MmZjMmM2ZjFjMWI6MHg3MzUwYzM3NGNjNzg1NzNlGUQ5hyEoHkdAIa9cb5upOBhAKg5JLCBwZXQgZ29hdCBJSRgCIAEoAg">https://earth.google.com/web/@46.2355997,6.0553345,449.29338018a,703.79478435d,35y,0h,45t,0r/data=ClEaTxJJCiUweDQ3OGM2MmZjMmM2ZjFjMWI6MHg3MzUwYzM3NGNjNzg1NzNlGUQ5hyEoHkdAIa9cb5upOBhAKg5JLCBwZXQgZ29hdCBJSRgCIAEoAg</a></p>

<p>Make note that CERN - point 1 is directly next to this building.</p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/bwBoEGj">Image</a></p>

<p>Now, what is I, pet goat II? It&#39;s a weird as fuck video that is full of symbolism made by this group calling themselves Heliofant. You can view the video on their website <a href="http://www.heliofant.com">http://www.heliofant.com</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6n_xCI-peq0">Youtube</a>, or <a href="https://vimeo.com/44583147">Vimeo</a>. It features all kinds of wacky shit such as George W. Bush, Obama, the Twin Towers falling, Jesus Christ, symbols from Islam, Judiasm, and agent Egypt, serpents, eggs, aliens, and the list goes on. It could be an ARG, it could be the creation of someone in a psychotic episode (admittedly a person really good at 3D rendering, animation, music, and web design.), a very elaborate LARP, or a lot of things. I don&#39;t know what to make of it myself.</p>

<p>Here are some screenshots from the video from their website.

<p>Oh yeah, that Google Earth location. If you zoom out, you&#39;ll see plainly it&#39;s very close to Geneva. Now, I realize we&#39;re in the land of woo-woo right now, but while we&#39;re here, let&#39;s check out what Nostradamus has to say about Geneva waaay back in the 16th century.</p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/4bAMVA4">Nostradamus - Century 9 - Quatrain 44</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Leave, leave Geneva every last one of you,
Saturn from gold to iron will be changed.
The opposing RAYPOZ will exterminate all
Before it has started the sky will show signs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Original</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Migres migre de GeneSue treStous
Saturne d&#39;or en fer Se changera.
Le contre RAYPOZ exterminera tous
Auant l&#39;a ruent le ciel Signes fera.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you can stand the &quot;woo-woo&quot; then stay with me, I&#39;m about to be done. Saturn is worshipped as a god in a death cult. See here:

<p>The funny thing about the occult is, it doesn&#39;t really matter if you and I believe in it or not. To the people who do believe in it, it is real, and their belief leads to actions that cause very real consequences for people like me and you. Take care dear reader. I hope you don&#39;t think I&#39;m a nutter, but it&#39;s okay if you do. :) I would ask that you leave your comments and criticism if I&#39;ve lit a spark in your noggin.</p>

<p>Would you like to know more? How about when 4chan accidentally summoned an Egyptian deity named Kek?

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m aware. I read the thread a couple days ago which actually led me to do some more research myself. This is some of my findings.</p>

<p>The Kek stuff is really fascinating even if you don&#39;t believe they are summoning a deity. If you didn&#39;t read the entirety of that article it&#39;s a wild ride. I think there is some evidence of a kind of social hivemind manifesting itself through memes. Sounds fucking ridiculous because it is. :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The group who made it openly says that it, in fact, is Jesus. They were showing him with the Egyptian symbolism and the illuminati symbolism as a way to take back those symbols that have been corrupted. The Egyptian symbolism is &quot;Egyptian Deity Anapa. He is associated with the afterlife and protects the souls of men in their journey through the underworld. He also weighs the truth and the heart of those souls before deciding their fate.&quot; and the Third eye is &quot;The all-seeing eye, in the elite world view, is about control and surveillance of every person and aspect of society. When placed on the Christ character, it means the opening up of the third eye or pineal gland that permits a unhindered communication with God, as well as other dimensions. In other words, clear spiritual vision.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I disagree with you on several points, but you raise a valid argument. There is evidence of the occult in our government and leadership.</p>

<p>I disagree when you say the occult doesn&#39;t exist. Please point me towards the sources you have read which prove this so that I may provide you with some that counter it.</p>

<p>I also disagree with you that our entire world is physical. There are entire spectrums of energy we cannot perceive and do not fully understand. I think that our physical universe could potentially be manipulated if we were able to understand its inner workings. I think its possible some of the so called &#39;elite&#39; may understand parts of those workings.</p>

<p>I never said I would surrender to anyone attempting to control me, and this is how I am fighting. By trying to expose this knowledge to those who will look at it with an open mind. All fighting is not physical.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Only rational thinkng will remove a belief in the supernatural. 
And I don&#39;t know what you use as evidence to support your belief but I probably have been exposed to the same ideas and have rejected what you embrace. So that argument is only what you believe versus what I believe. </p>

<p>As for this:  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are entire spectrums of energy we cannot perceive and do not fully understand. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Just because we don&#39;t understand or have not yet identified something doesn&#39;t mean it doesn&#39;t exist, and if it exists, there is evidence and function. </p>

<p>And for that not yet identified, I prefer to say, we don&#39;t know not credit it to something that has no evidence or purpose. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that our beliefs are different and honestly I don&#39;t want to persuade you to my way of thinking. Because I know I cannot. Instead, I do think we can have a mutual discussion of our different beliefs in order to propel our own unique knowledge. Would you like to discuss further?</p>

<p>All I can say is I&#39;ve had personal experiences that have led me to the place I am today. I&#39;d prefer not to go into detail so publicly as they are <em>personal</em> but there you have it.</p>

<p>Now, regarding the spectrums of energy we don&#39;t understand. I am referring to the possibility that the universe is made up of vibration so to speak. What is also known as the holographic universe theory. You can check it out here.</p>

<p><a href="https://phys.org/news/2017-01-reveals-substantial-evidence-holographic-universe.html">https://phys.org/news/2017-01-reveals-substantial-evidence-holographic-universe.html</a></p>

<p>I think that the supernatural could eventually be explained as interference from other dimensions in a holographic universe. A manifestation of a higher dimensional being in our lower, third dimension. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not necessarily but I don&#39;t think we can write it off as outside the realm of possibility. Do some research into Tibetan monks levitating rocks. There&#39;s been a lot of evidence shown that sound can be used to manipulate solid matter and that possibly our ancestors knew how to harness this power.</p>

<p>Also look up the study of Cymatics. Which shows how different sound frequencies create patterns of increasing complexity in sand and water as the frequencies increase.</p>

<p>I can provide you some links later. Getting ready for work.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Only rational thinkng will remove a belief in the supernatural. 
And I don&#39;t know what you use as evidence to support your belief but I probably have been exposed to the same ideas and have rejected what you embrace. So that argument is only what you believe versus what I believe. </p>

<p>As for this:  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are entire spectrums of energy we cannot perceive and do not fully understand. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Just because we don&#39;t understand or have not yet identified something doesn&#39;t mean it doesn&#39;t exist, and if it exists, there is evidence and function. </p>

<p>And for that not yet identified, I prefer to say, we don&#39;t know not credit it to something that has no evidence or purpose. </p>
