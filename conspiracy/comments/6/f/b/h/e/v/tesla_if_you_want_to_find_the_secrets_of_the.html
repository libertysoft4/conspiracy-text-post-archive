        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Nikola Tesla meant:</p>

<p>Simply consider this: Life everywhere is composed of far more space than matter. (This is easily observable with either a microscope or a telescope. Not surprisingly, the universe and a grain of sand look exactly the same, depending upon the degree of the sand’s magnification. The macrocosm and the microcosm are essentially identical.) Now when pure energy—the primal expression of Life that we will call the Essential Essence—coagulates, it transforms into what would be called, in human terms, “matter.” Because these coagulations are vibrating or vacillating at a sufficient speed, the particles constantly move. They not only vibrate or rotate in place, they also move through space, propelled by the energy of their spin—not unlike a top moving across a table as it spins. These countless particles can move so fast (in relative terms) that they appear to be neither here nor there, but everywhere at once, thus creating the illusion of solidity—or what you would call, that which is “physical.”</p>

<p>You can watch the blades of a fan or the spokes of a bicycle wheel producing exactly this same illusion. The illusion of solidity.</p>

<p>Now, should the space between the spokes of a bicycle wheel be sufficiently enormous (as it would feel to you if you were the size of a microbe and your perspective was therefore myopic), all you would see for a very long time—until the next spoke of the wheel came by—is empty space. In effect, while you are waiting and watching for the next spoke, the solidity will appear to have disappeared. What you do not know is that it was never there to begin with. It was merely the speed of the spokes moving past your line of sight that created the illusion of solidity.</p>

<p>The formula is simple: Time + Space = Appearance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The oscillator/&quot;earthquake machine&quot; was explored in 2006 in Episode 60 – &quot;Earthquake Machine&quot;. The MythBusters made a device powered by electricity rather than steam. It produced vibrations that could be felt hundreds of feet away, but no earthquake shaking on the modern bridge they attached to; they judged that the claim that the device produced an earthquake to be false (i.e. a &quot;busted myth&quot;).</p>

University of California, Department of Engineering.<br/>
<a href="http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/608808.pdf">http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/608808.pdf</a><br/>
They spent more effort on that paper than 100 years worth of mythbusters .<br/>
&#39;&#39;At a very specific pitch, infrasound explodes matter. At others, infrasound incapacitates and kills. Organisms rupture in its blast. Sea creatures use this power to stun and kill prey.&#39;&#39;  <a href="https://borderlandsciences.org/journal/vol/52/n04/Vassilatos_on_Vladimir_Gavreau.html">https://borderlandsciences.org/journal/vol/52/n04/Vassilatos_on_Vladimir_Gavreau.html</a><br/>
....&#39;&#39;These experiments with infrasonics were as dangerous as those early investigations of nuclear energy. Dr. Gavreau and his associates were dangerously ill for nearly a day after these preliminary tests. These maladies were sustained for hours after the device was [32] turned off. Infrasonic assaults on the body are the more lethal because they come with dreadful silence. The eyesight of Dr. Gavreau and his fellow workers were affected for days. More dangerously were their internal organs affected: the heart, lungs, stomach, intestinal cavity were filled with continual painful spasms for an equal time period.&#39;&#39;<br/>
And mythbusters pretended to &#39;&#39;debunk&#39;&#39; the whole range of studies, with improper equipment, and very little knowledge.<br/>
The show is boiled down for the 4th grade level of education.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Myth busters is not the authority on reality.  Look at my drug dog example.  If Myth busters is the authority on reality then drug dogs are always effective.  This is contrary to reality.</p>

<p>Their show is entertaining, but by no means are all of their experiments fullproof.</p>

<p>Once again I feel the need to clarify my argument.  I&#39;m not saying that the oscillation thing works or that the myth busters are wrong about it, just that myth busters testing something and coming to a conclusion doesn&#39;t mean they are actually correct.  They don&#39;t test certain conditions and can&#39;t test all conditions.  This becomes important when the conditions in the test could influence the outcome of the test.</p>

<p>And unless their experiments are verified by the scientific community, people shouldn&#39;t be pointing to them as fact.  It&#39;s just as bad to assume that the oscillation thing works, as it is to assume that it doesn&#39;t work, just because the myth busters tried an experiment.</p>

Not only are they not scientists; they&#39;re not even engineers. Both engineers and scientists have busted them numerous times for goofing in their methodology and drawing flawed conclusions. And 2) The &quot;Mystbusters&quot; have been censored and suppressed. Such as when they tried to have a segment on RFID technology and the credit card companies shut them down.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure with their &quot;modern understanding of science,&quot; the Hollywood prop makers will show that illiterate 19th Century barbarian for the bumpkin he was.</p>

<p>It must be so awesome to live in a world where basic cable TV hosts are the intellectual superior of 19th Century hacks. Maybe Bill Nye should be used to contradict Einstein?

<p>As we all know: TV hosts with their &quot;modern understanding of science&quot; just leave those 19th Century idiots in the dust.</p>

<p>Screw using Adam and Jamie to debunk that 19th Century goon, Max Planck, with his crazy &quot;Quantum Mechanics&quot; blithering, I want them to set their sites on a real caveman: Leonard Da Vinci.

Once we are in tune we will ascend from 3D consciousness to 5D. This processs literally just begun and could take hundreds of years but without a doubt we are entering prophetic times.

    <div class="md"><p>LancerFIN is right. Using &quot;Mythbusters&quot; as your &quot;scientific source&quot; is problematic because 1) They&#39;re not scientists; they&#39;re Hollywood prop makers. Not only are they not scientists; they&#39;re not even engineers. Both engineers and scientists have busted them numerous times for goofing in their methodology and drawing flawed conclusions. And 2) The &quot;Mystbusters&quot; have been censored and suppressed. Such as when they tried to have a segment on RFID technology and the credit card companies shut them down.</p>
