        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>If you break it down into these separate parts, it doesn&#39;t seem insane at all:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>There is an elite group of assholes running this world with a multi-trillion dollar budget.  That&#39;s a pretty standard conclusion we have all come to from our research.  Through enslavement with debt, they practically own all the wealth in the world (or at least most of it).</p></li>
<li><p>Humans can go to Mars.  That&#39;s not such an outrageous concept when you are dealing with an elite group of assholes in control of a multi-trillion dollar budget.  It would take many trips into our orbit to prepare the cargo needed for such a trip, but it&#39;s not science fiction.  It&#39;s just expensive.      </p></li>
<li><p>Elitists kidnap children.  That is not a wild conclusion either if you have followed the many decades of evidence surrounding Pedogate.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Is it not possible then, with the above 3 points, that the rich assholes who control us through debt enslavement might be interested in setting up a small colony on Mars?  Obviously they wouldn&#39;t be sending their own kids...</p>

<p>Now go ahead.. tell me why this is so absurd.  I have yet to hear a good counter-argument to the theory.  Why is it impossible?  Which of the 3 points above is the hardest to believe, and why?</p>

<p>edit: many replies later, I still don&#39;t see a valid counter-argument.  All I see are things like &quot;We don&#39;t like to explore.  Earth has plenty for us&quot;.  Really?  Is that the official stance of this sub?  Pathetic..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The reason why this is absurd on the face of it, is because you haven&#39;t even provided a MOTIVE for the supposed elite pedophile rings to put their slave colony on mars.  That seems like a massive logistical problem, as well has a huge security risk, to no end.  It also seems like it would actually be a hindrance, since the next time you want to summon the devil you have to travel all the way to mars to find a sacrifice</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If the motive is the only piece I&#39;m missing then damn, I did pretty good.  lol..</p>

<p>Like I said to someone else in here, mankind has always wanted to explore other planets and setting up camp is just part of it.  Just because you think it&#39;s pointless doesn&#39;t mean there isn&#39;t someone who is up for the task.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t say the motive was the only missing piece, I said it was the first thing that jumps out as absurd.</p>

<p>I agree that just because I can&#39;t imagine a motive doesn&#39;t mean someone else can&#39;t imagine a motive.  But I don&#39;t see why it is worthwhile to entertain your idea when not even you can imagine why someone would bother to do this.  You are asking people to consider the possibility that there are unknown people doing something unknown which seems impossible, using an unknown means, toward unknown ends.  And all without evidence!   At least give me a blurry photo of a martian rock formation that looks like a pentagram or something, jeez</p>

<p>2) man has always reached for the stars, and man would not squander the opportunity to set up an actual colony on mars by sending a bunch of kids.</p>

<p>Of course, you&#39;ll retort with some &quot;but they are so rich, that&#39;s exactly why they would do something this stupid!&quot; I&#39;ll respond by calling you an idiot for such a pathetic response. Then you&#39;ll follow up by taking it personally and accusing me of being a shill or other agent of tptb. And then I&#39;ll finish this off by pointing out once again how ridiculous your claims are.</p>

<p>That was fun. Post some other ridiculous theory sometime and we can do this again.</p>

<p>Anyway, there&#39;s not shortage willing adults going to Mars, so using children would be pointless. Willing adults will always do a better job than slave children. A community on another planet would require cooks, maintenance engineers, doctors, repair workshop operators, etc.. all which are jobs that children can&#39;t do, except for cooking. </p>

<p>If you buy the whole 20 yr thing, then it might make sense to get kids.  But there isn&#39;t going to be a lot of grunt work on mars, most of it will be technical.  Just kidnapping someone who is already skilled would be 5 times as efficient.</p>

<p>There are many people worldwide who go missing without a trace.  No real motive to disappear, no suspects, etc.  A colony on Mars could solve a lot of missing persons.  But they old said it was a child sex slave colony?  Yes, but someone has to take care of the tots until they&#39;re ready to fulfill their purpose to create life on this new planet which would include adults from almost every profession of life.</p>

<p>If it&#39;s something of a Hollywood script, I tend to believe there is some truth to it.  Is it like they &quot;leaked&quot;?

<p>They&#39;d need children because they&#39;re using ion engined craft (cheaper, more efficient but lengthier trip), the kids would be easier to groom/ train/ brainwash than adults and they would have longer life spans due to their age and the longer solar orbit of mars around the sun. </p>
