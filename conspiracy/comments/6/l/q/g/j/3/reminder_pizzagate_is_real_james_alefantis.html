<p>This is a gross and entirely false misrepresentation. </p>

<p>I created the Antinous sub to serve as a reference for some materials I found in my searches, nothing more. You should read them, you might learn Antinous is not actually held in high esteem by pedophiles but is actually held in high esteem by the gay community because a Roman emperor deified (that means &quot;made into a God&quot;) him after his death - because he loved him, not because he was a teenager. </p>

<p><em>Your</em> interminable fascination with linking innocuous baby photos to pedophillia are more concerning than my fully sourced reasonable replies in these threads. </p>

<p>I remember back when the right-wing insult of choice was mocking &quot;feels over reals,&quot; but it seems that&#39;s where all this unsubstantiated appeal to morality is going. I have yet to see <strong>one</strong> fact that connects CPP to pedophilia beyond a reasonable doubt. ONE. If that&#39;s so difficult then maybe you&#39;re wasting time drawing lines in the sand.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It seems like a larp because <a href="/u/AbortionBurger">/u/AbortionBurger</a> was intimately involved in the AMA. There is also the question of the mysterious account called <a href="/u/JamesAlefantis">/u/JamesAlefantis</a> which showed up shortly after the thread was created seen here <a href="http://archive.is/u4cXv">http://archive.is/u4cXv</a></p>

<p>The guy never made a complaint to police therefore Alefantis has nothing to answer. </p>

<p>You&#39;ll also be aware <a href="/u/SVMESSEFVIFVTVRVS">/u/SVMESSEFVIFVTVRVS</a> doesn&#39;t appear in these threads to back up your story perhaps because AbortionBurger doxxed him in her steemit article so he very possibly is afraid of being charged with libel. </p>

<p>Some sound logic in the link you posted </p>

<blockquote>
<p>First off, a screenshot with someone&#39;s face is not proof of anything. It&#39;s a proof that he is a human, and that he controls the reddit account. It doesn&#39;t prove he worked at CPP, it doesn&#39;t prove that Alefantis sexually assaulted him. I could post a screenshot of my face and username and claim that I was raped by Jesus himself.</p>

<p>Secondly, you&#39;re going to have to bring way more reliable evidence than a screencap of a facebook conversation with the faces blacked out. Those are stupidly easy to fake, and we have no confirmation of anything that man is saying. Absolutely no way to verify anything independently.</p>

<p>I know this is a conspiracy sub and a lot of it is theory, but please have some form of standards with what you call evidence. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hmmm, maybe the comment at the end could be described as an ad hominem, but the first part of my comment certainly could not.</p>

<p>Its purely semantics to go into whether the photo is of a boy or girl.  An objective and rational person would simply say what the fuck is someone using pedo code in the comments of photos containing children.  Many other photos posted where highly questionable as well.  The subject is absolutely putrid, and I would be highly suspicious of anyone posting this kind of material.</p>

<p>Actually, most of that &quot;sexualized imagery&quot; was on another Instagram account, but the pictures were tagged with Comet Ping Pong.</p>

<p>No, that was yet another Instagram account and the &quot;coffin&quot; was a <a href="http://i.imgur.com/iCjC73w.png">coffin-shaped coffee table</a>, just as it said on the Instagram post.</p>

<p>Just the sort of perverts you would want sharing pictures of your child tied too a table.</p>

<p>Why tag child sized coffins Comet ping pong?</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the pictures so others can make up their own minds about the connections.</p>

<p>The most disturbing images too me are the ones tagged cum panda.</p>

<p>A cum panda being the practice of punching someone in the face after they have just made you cum giving them two black eyes like a panda.</p>

<p>But no concerns about someone with this fetish tying children too tables and sharing the images with his perverse buddies.</p>

<p>There are thousands of people who think the Earth is flat, and no amount of overwhelming evidence or proof that will convince them otherwise. And why the fuck would &quot;pizza boy&quot; bother to respond to your ludicrous claims? Responding to them would only further fan the flames; anything this guy says or does is going to garner your immediate paranoia. Instead of actually doing something productive, such as helping law enforcement with <em>actual</em> pedophilia cases or contributing to a charity, you sit behind your computer and bring down contributing members of society simply because... <em>I don&#39;t even know why</em>.

 I&#39;ll say it, pizzagate is bullshit.  Yes, you are a bunch of sad dorks shouting over nothing.  The leaps you guys make skirt the edges of sanity. A bunch of sad 20 somethings with hero complexes that come from too many pokemon and naruto cartoons.  Proof is in the pudding, and you don&#39;t have any.</p>

<p>You mean like &quot; bend over this table while I tie you down&quot;</p>

<p>Or &quot; stand in this shopping basket while I take photos of you so I can joke about selling kids too my pervy friends&quot;</p>

<p>I make no demands from this poor little girl.</p>

<p>I do point out that its odd/worrying that no one has seen her since these pictures were discovered.</p>

<p>This little girl must go too school,presumably in the Washington area,yet no one has seen her. </p>

<p>Does she have no friends?</p>

<p>No parents of other children at her school?</p>

<p>Does she not go outside?</p>

<p>Also pizza boy didn&#39;t care too much about her anonymity when he was posting disturbing pictures of her on his perverted Instagram account.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You ask that she be identified, and paraded around to disprove your completely lacking in evidence claim that she&#39;s dead.  S&#39;funny.  People only know about his instagram (for the most part) because you guys decided pizzagate was the realist thing that was ever real, and decided to take apart every thing related to the guy in an attempt to prove he&#39;s a pervert.  So, we go back to the start: doxxing a little girl is fine.  Doxxing  racist is a horrific invasion of privacy.</p>

<p>A bit different .</p>

<p>CNN are a multinational ,billion dollar news agency targeting a reddit user for posting a meme that makes fun of them.</p>

<p>Pizza boy is suspected by millions of people around the world of being a pedophile he has posted pictures of a child in a distressing situation, ie tied to a table alongside pictures of child sized coffins. Its not unreasonable for people to want too make sure this child didn&#39;t end up in said coffin.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wait, what? The President&#39;s campaign chair was retweeting &quot;muh holocaust&quot; memes during the campaign. The President himself has been sued for racial discrimination, has a long history of expressed racist attitudes, and just retweeted a meme that either he or a staffer found by following a person on a reddit sub with his and its own long history of racism and discrimination. The whole fucking thing points strongly to Trump&#39;s attitudes towards race and religion <em>at least</em> being highly suspect. All the right people? Like who? People are quitting the Trump white house left and right because he doesn&#39;t listen to them. For fuck&#39;s sake, his ethics chair just resigned because he couldn&#39;t work with Trump. Not to mention the incredibly damaging behavior around the Russian allegations - even if you don&#39;t believe that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia during the election, Trump&#39;s behavior in handling the ongoing investigation has been at least dishonest and authoritarian, if not downright illegal. If Obama or Clinton had done <em>any</em> of this the right would literally be in the streets calling for them to be impeached <em>and they would have been right to do so.</em> So please explain to me how Trump continuing his habit of furthering extreme white nationalist ideas from extreme white nationalist communities is a fucking non issue. You&#39;re a sheep or a troll and I personally don&#39;t have respect for either.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because if you make a joke about a mexican, while playing on sterotypes, that&#39;s racist.  What&#39;s the difference between &quot;a lazy mexican spends all day not working, except on his tan&quot; and &quot;A lazy guy spends all day not working, except on his tan&quot;  the first one is racist (and very mildly funny, but not because of the racist language) and the second one is just as funny, but doesn&#39;t involve racial stereotypes about mexicans.  If you&#39;re making a joke about an ethnic minority, you should really try to redo it to remove racist language.  If you can&#39;t remove the racist language and still have the joke be &quot;funny&quot;, chances are it&#39;s a racist joke.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s impossible to tell someone&#39;s intention on a reddit post that solely contains the racist joke.  I admit that I sometimes make inappropriate jokes (like when I say that Obama committed the crime of being black while presidenting, to highlight the absurdity of people who actually make that claim), but the totality of my posts on this site would hopefully show that I&#39;m not a racist, or that I at least try not to be (there&#39;s always some inherent biases due to privilege, which isn&#39;t to beat people over the head about it, it&#39;s just that you don&#39;t always know something&#39;s wrong if you never experience it in a negative context.)  If all my posts were &quot;absurdist&quot; takes on racial jokes, then how can you tell the difference between me, and a racist who&#39;s posting those joke non-ironically?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right, and all these accusations are false, along with the Wikileaks dumps, the Instagram posts and all the lies from Alefantis. </p>

<p>/s</p>

<p>You&#39;d have to really be ahead of the game, as well as ahead of Wikileaks and Alefantis&#39; perverted social media to come up with something like pizzagate, seeing as it literally stemmed from the Podesta emails. Do 20 minutes of reaearch on VOAT or Steemit and you&#39;ll know it&#39;s more than &quot;fake news&quot;. </p>

<p>What about Alefantis&#39; buddy who makes children&#39;s coffins? What about the fact he attends Rothschild dinners? What about the fact he has NEVER adressed any of the controversial claims against him, like the kill room post, the chickenlover post, the cumpanda post or the other numerous perverted social media posts? </p>

<p>What about the fact he owns at least 4 properties in DC being a college dropout? Literally no post grad education. He also has a restaurant in Berlin (human trafficking central) called Nalu diner.</p>

<p>Too much smoke without fire.</p>

<p>Move along.</p>

<p>The god daughter of James Alefantis is Caris James. Just search for her, then compare all of the Instagram photos and you will see for yourself that she is in most of the photos. Keep in mind, though, that she appears in the photos at different ages in her life. For example, she sometimes appears as a baby, then at other times as a toddler, like in the &quot;chicken lovers&quot; photo.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s examine how investigative journalism used to work using Watergate. 
People contacted reporters for the Washington Post. They made accusations that there was a robbery and a coverup. They did not have proof. Because the reporters heard the same information from two sources, so they printed the allegations. However, still nothing was proved. 
The newspaper reports put pressure on members of the government, called Congress, to open an investigation into the executive branch. 
Still no proof.  Someone said their may be taped recordings of conversations in the White House. Finally physical proof. </p>

<p>Then the President was impeached. The President&#39;s crime was not the original robbery, it was the cover-up.  </p>

<p>Get it?
Step One: Testimony and Circumstantial evidence
Step Two: Investigative make allegations based on more than one source. Based on testimony and circumstantial evidence.
Step Three: A legal authority opens an investigation
Step Four: Find PROOF of crimes and cover-up.
Stop Five: Punish crimes.</p>

<p>This was a blog of cute baby pictures with a few videos. Tamera Luzzatto did not run the blog, Evie&#39;s father did.</p>

<p>The blog was not invite-only until internet stalkers started harassing the Luzzattos. </p>

<p>There is a little bit archived here: <a href="http://archive.is/3nW3z">http://archive.is/3nW3z</a></p>

<p>There were more pictures archived on sli.mg but that site has been down since mid-January.</p>

<p>As you can see, there&#39;s nothing unusual about the photos <em>at all</em>. </p>

<p>Also, the father tries to make humorous remarks on nearly every picture. People are trying to insinuate that there&#39;s something sinister about the phrase &quot;raw and uncut&quot;, but that&#39;s just the way he writes. </p>

<p>EDIT: Well, after looking at the header on the archive.is page, I figured out there are more pages archived.</p>

<p>Here is the biggest group of pictures: <a href="https://archive.is/2g30Y">https://archive.is/2g30Y</a></p>

<p>As you can see, there&#39;s nothing suspicious about <em>any</em> of the pictures.</p>

<p>And <a href="https://archive.is/8PZDn">here is the first post on the blog:</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is where the magic happens!</p>

<p>Welcome! If you are here you are one of the first people to view Evie&#39;s blog! And our friends should thank us---by indulging ourselves with this web portal we are NOT filling your inboxes with large files of pictures and videos! </p>

<p>Enjoy and we will look forward to your comments....</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And <a href="https://archive.is/Gm498">another one from that day:</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Evie&#39;s first day</p>

<p>Here is Dad the night I was born. Very glad he didn&#39;t make it through Organic Chemistry to become a doctor, this site doesn&#39;t inspire confidence.</p>

<p>So, it is the father who made the site.</p>

<p>LAPD involvement in the Cecil Hotel Elisa Lam case is also disgustingly obvious, yet all it takes is a mental diagnosis and an official story and the case is closed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>How does this prove that the hard drive was hit by the bullet though?
 He would&#39;ve had to fire directly down into the case to hit it from that entry point, and the closet was locked. I would assume that the bullet passed diagonally through the case from the front to back, which makes it difficult to imagine that it was able to hit the hard drive.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re going for a conspiracy angle, it seems far more likely that this was a false flag to discredit Pizzagate. There are more reliable and effective ways to destroy hard drives that don&#39;t involve attracting a large amount of police and media attention. For all we know, the hard drive is sitting there still in perfect condition- it&#39;s not like the police are investigating him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I tend to think it was probably a &quot;false flag&quot; to get sympathy for the pizza place)it&#39;s owner and therefore link anyone investigating it as hurtful people who are ruining these people&#39;s lives, etc. That&#39;s not a stretch at all, and it worked to a degree. These people run off the same playbook time and time again and once you familiarize yourself with it it&#39;s not that hard to spot things like this. </p>

<p>Someone needs to explain to me how this video &quot;proves&quot; that Pegasus is the &quot;kill room&quot;. All this video shows us that JA bought a building and began renovating it, the building is near a playground, and there is faded graffiti on a wall somewhere nearby that says &quot;kids&quot;. I almost couldn&#39;t continue the video when it pointed out the black truck in the street view picture and claimed it belongs to the guy helping with renovations.... It&#39;s a street view shot from god knows when....</p>

<p>How do you make out that the guy is looking through binoculars? If he is he is only using one hand to do it because to me it looks like his left arm is at his side. I would say he&#39;s more likely talking on a cell phone than looking through binoculars.</p>

<p>When you read about my confession to being raped by a man in Washington DC 8 years ago, don&#39;t worry, I am just pretending to do it so I can get an under the table payment from the Republican Party. Yes, I know that the Republican party is often again gay rights, but I know that Trump will be a great president, so I will accept the public humiliation of being a male rape victim.  Some may laugh at me but don&#39;t worry, I made the whole story up for cash. </p>

<p>NONE have been discredited.  Just because you say something doesn&#39;t magically make it true. Comments on pizzagate posts are filled with people denying the evidence.

    <div class="md"><p>Hey Waco.  I, for one, don&#39;t what any of the pedogate stuff to be true.  It&#39;s disgusting and bad for the soul to even consider.  I am hardly an expert on anything, much less on the topic of Comet.  When I first heard the accusations I chuckled to myself and wondered how anyone could believe something so bizarre.  </p>

<p>However, over time you begin to see numerous coincidences and patterns that begin repeating that are all directly related to pizza/pedogate.  You become curious and research for yourself a little bit each day.  Nothing extensive - just enough to answer your own questions for things that seem unusual about the situation.</p>

<p>I believe I&#39;m a pretty normal person with basic interests.  Not a fanatic or crazy as far as I&#39;m aware.  I keep quiet most of the time and respect other people&#39;s opinions because often I&#39;m able to learn from them even if not agreeing with the entirety of it.</p>

<p>I think if you decided to look more into it you&#39;d at least open up to the possibilty of there being more than meets the eye.  Conspiracy is a big sub and there are many fanatics here - it just attracts that type.  Though I can guarantee there are more &quot;normal&quot; people who rarely make themselves known that feel similar to me.</p>

<p>There are too many oddities about Alefantis and pedogate, from what I have seen at this point, to write it off as coincidence.  And I think a lot of people would also see it that way if they took a little time each day to see what the conspiracy nuts are talking about and try to relate to their views.</p>

<p>4chan when the Podesta emails were released: &quot;they&#39;re doing all of this out in the open using code! We&#39;ve figured out the key&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol. This tactic.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t care when you want to say it started. The Podesta emails were what launched the &quot;omg, look at these emails where they use codes for crimes against children!&quot;, as well as bringing people like Alefantis and Silsby into the mix.</p>

<p>The &quot;code&quot; emails turned out to be a joke. No direct email contact from Podesta to Alefantis or vice versa, etc. But someone saying &quot;dominos on cheese&quot; must mean some kind of sex crime.</p>

<p>FBIAnon on 4chan was the beginning.  Podesta emails were an instance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry to bother you. 
I went back and deleted all the duplicate comments except one. </p>

<p>But some interesting information did come out of it. </p>

<p>You may have noticed that I spammed comments on a PG post that seems to have stabilized at around 800 up votes. When I posted my comments, the post itself was only about 1 day old.</p>

<p>The highest rated comments on this posting were PG negative. 
I wanted to do something about it. </p>

<p>I went to this thread because another user on conspiracy did a posting complaining about the original posting being a shill controlled post with up votes on comments used to discredit PG research. 
Being that the post is still only 2 days old, it seems odd that no one reacted to my spamming except to report my spamming. 
I think only 2 or 3 person responded to my numerous comments with a comment. Very few people even down-voted my spam comments. Strange.</p>

<p>It seems that once a post reaches a satisfactory support level for a shill position, as a group they disengage. Is that possible? </p>

<p>Good luck with the professional shills and bots. I don&#39;t know how you are going to weed them out. If you look at my comment history, you will see that I am not a Trump RNC shill, so please don&#39;t ban me. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Whoa there buddy looks like you&#39;re getting upset and hitting buttons too fast.</p>

<p>Nobody who believes PG is true thinks that the shooter was legitimate.  Find me one person who both supports PG and doesn&#39;t think the shooter was an actor.  What kind of a fucking moron walks in with a gun and then shoots a hard drive because reasons?</p>

<p>I&#39;m assuming you&#39;re also not well versed in money laundering or other criminal practices.  <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/restaurants-and-jewelry-stores-are-the-hot-new-money-laundering-spots-in-mexico-2011-4">Here&#39;s a thing on how restaurants and jewelry stores are the new hot fronts in mexico for money laundering</a></p>

<p>So, with this new information in your brain I hope you can understand how cheese pizza sold by a pizza place isn&#39;t alway cheese pizza.  Especially when hackers find a way into the secure part of your pizza server (why do you have a password protected members only area for a pizza place? Uber deals?) and find a bunch of encrypted files that look like they&#39;re videos (judging by file size w.r.t. encryption)</p>

<p>Again, for the umpteenth time: <em>just because you say something doesn&#39;t make it true</em>.  Just because you assert that in this instance the CP is Pizza and not CP does not make you right.</p>

<p>Show me Bill fucking Clinton rescuing child trafficking &quot;filmmakers&quot; from NK in under a week, but leaving numerous other US citizens, most recently Otto the 20-ish year old college kid, to fucking rot and die being discredited -- (Theory: (Before you froth at the mouth about lack of proof, remember you&#39;re on a conspiracy sub, theories are what the sub is built on) Child traffickers aka pizzagaters go to places nobody in the western world fucking cares about. Russia recently shut off its US adoption program because they likely suspect fuckery. Haiti got fucked. Africa in general gets fucked. Runaways get fucked. North Korea also gets fucked. US coalition of pizzagate sent traffickers to North Korea under the guise of &quot;making a film.&quot; In the process of &quot;researching&quot; the film, they likely asked around about buying a child, &quot;for filmmaking&quot; of course. It&#39;s a pretty great cover. What&#39;s the difference between a child trafficker and someone making a film about child trafficking? Well I&#39;d assume that the filmmaker doesn&#39;t actually buy the child, but once you&#39;ve set them up with a seller it&#39;s not like the seller is going to come out and tell the public &quot;hey this person didn&#39;t just interview me, they actually bought a child&quot;</p>

<p>Show me every news anchor who does an honest job of covering pizzagate being fired being discredited.</p>

<p><strong>NONE of this has been discredited.</strong> Just because you say something doesn&#39;t magically make it true. Comments on pizzagate posts are filled with people denying the evidence. I&#39;ve yet to see anyone who denies the evidence be able to actually hold their own against anyone who has done research. I&#39;ve yet to see anyone who denies the evidence able to actually cite any evidence beyond the ones that they have talking points for (where&#39;d they get those talking points I wonder!)</p>

<p>I will get hammered with downvotes but no discrediting.  That&#39;s because bot farms can&#39;t counter facts, but they can artificially influence the narrative.</p>

<p>Ok, use your critical thinking, if they were harvesting corneas would they chuck them in a uncooled box under a table, and actually label it &quot;STOLEN ORGANS&quot; , and let a reporter into the area where they&#39;re harvesting organs? are they just stealing eyes and nothing else? was there a rash of people who lost corneas? the arguement that they didnt have the equipment to use donor corneas also means they likely couldn&#39;t be harvesting them.</p>

<p>They bail out misguided bible thumpers, they weren&#39;t convicted of child trafficking and the kids parents were OK with what they did because they didn&#39;t want them starving.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Vout noted that Antinous came to be identified as &quot;a gay icon&quot;. Novelist and independent scholar Sarah Waters identified Antinous as being &quot;at the forefront of the homosexual imagination&quot; in late nineteenth-century Europe. In this, Antinous replaced the figure of Ganymede, who had been the primary homoerotic representation in the visual arts during the Renaissance. Gay author Karl Heinrich Ulrichs celebrated Antinous in an 1865 pamphlet that he authored under the pseudonym of &quot;Numa Numantius.&quot; In 1893, homophile newspaper The Artist, began offering cast statues of Antinous for £3, 10s. The author Oscar Wilde referenced Antinous in both &quot;The Young King&quot; (1891) and &quot;The Sphinx&quot; (1894).&quot;</p>

<p>Do you have any modern references to him being used as a symbol of pedophilia? And again, its not like he had a picture of Hadrian as his profile. Hell, it could be neither given that antonius is the most common surviving figure in sculpture by a lot.</p>

<p>I just dont think the corneas are enough to go on, if the box got opened and actually had corneas in it(non plastic ones mind you) itd be harder to explain. You can&#39;t prove the corneas mean anything because you have nothing else than that unopened box, so how is it supposed to be disproven</p>

US coalition of pizzagate sent traffickers to North Korea under the guise of &quot;making a film.&quot; In the process of &quot;researching&quot; the film, they likely asked around about buying a child, &quot;for filmmaking&quot; of course. It&#39;s a pretty great cover. What&#39;s the difference between a child trafficker and someone making a film about child trafficking? Well I&#39;d assume that the filmmaker doesn&#39;t actually buy the child, but once you&#39;ve set them up with a seller it&#39;s not like the seller is going to come out and tell the public &quot;hey this person didn&#39;t just interview me, they actually bought a child&quot;</p>

Your Google Trends link doesn’t show it being created, the two terms were used together because PizzaGate is fake news so of course they will trend together… If you can use Google Trends then you can use Google to find the term “fake news” being used long before PizzaGate, and during and after PizzaGate without reference to it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, not using logic.  You are making an unsubstantiated logical leap.  The profile picture was literally a sculpture of Antinous.  The quote about pederastic love was specifically about sculptures of Antinous.  You are assuming that this instance of a sculpture was intended as &quot;gay icon&quot; and not &quot;pederastic ideal&quot; when Alefantis&#39;s exact sculpture was indeed one of the very sculptures considered &quot;pederastic ideal.&quot;  </p>

<p>You think the main reason corporate politicians (Dems and GOP) don&#39;t improve healthcare is because they&#39;re pedos who&#39;re blackmailed not to?</p>

<p>If that was the case big pharma, the insurance industry, etc. wouldn&#39;t bother bribing them.  Why waste their money?  Dennis Hastert was against single payer because like many others, he&#39;s a sociopathic scumbag that&#39;s put bribes ahead of lives.  This sociopath also happens to be a pedo, no surprise.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s impossible to tell someone&#39;s intention on a reddit post that solely contains the racist joke.  I admit that I sometimes make inappropriate jokes (like when I say that Obama committed the crime of being black while presidenting, to highlight the absurdity of people who actually make that claim), but the totality of my posts on this site would hopefully show that I&#39;m not a racist, or that I at least try not to be (there&#39;s always some inherent biases due to privilege, which isn&#39;t to beat people over the head about it, it&#39;s just that you don&#39;t always know something&#39;s wrong if you never experience it in a negative context.)  If all my posts were &quot;absurdist&quot; takes on racial jokes, then how can you tell the difference between me, and a racist who&#39;s posting those joke non-ironically?</p>

<p>Vout noted that Antinous came to be identified as &quot;a gay icon&quot;.[99] Novelist and independent scholar Sarah Waters identified Antinous as being &quot;at the forefront of the homosexual imagination&quot; in late nineteenth-century Europe.[100] In this, Antinous replaced the figure of Ganymede, who had been the primary homoerotic representation in the visual arts during the Renaissance.[101] Gay author Karl Heinrich Ulrichs celebrated Antinous in an 1865 pamphlet that he authored under the pseudonym of &quot;Numa Numantius.&quot;[101] In 1893, homophile newspaper The Artist, began offering cast statues of Antinous for £3, 10s.[101] The author Oscar Wilde referenced Antinous in both &quot;The Young King&quot; (1891) and &quot;The Sphinx&quot; (1894).[101]</p>
