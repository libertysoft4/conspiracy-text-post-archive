        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I swear I&#39;m not selling anything. I sincerely need feedback on whether this is clear or confusing.
 I tried asking my fb friends, fb groups and have had not more than a few confused reactions. It could be my writing style. I don&#39;t know. It could be I&#39;m asking the wrong people which is why I&#39;m here.</p>

<p>The gist is that my research found that the KJV&#39;s Book of Genesis is a puzzle book and this is a possible first paragraph intro:</p>

<p>Paragraph:</p>

<p>Did you know there’s an old and storied body of knowledge called calendarics where cycles of time weren’t only made, they were played, and displayed like a badge of honor? It still is. Well, our trusty solar calendar is still made. And it hums at a low resonance in the background of our lives. Today, we’re lucky if a calendar tells us the monthly full moon date as not all of them do. But, in the heyday of calendarics, now that’s a different story altogether because our calendars were once full of life and color and many varied cycles of time. It wasn’t uncommon to have the full moon date alongside the predicted dates for the phases of Venus and the phases of the Jupiter and the phases of Mars and the phases of Mercury and the phases of Saturn. It was so ingrained into the lifestyle of that era that people and cultures had their favorite calendar cycles much like we have favorite colors or favorite teams or favorite state flowers. What’s more is that those spirited calendars and their cycles of time inspired the creation of vivid stories such as the Mediterranean mythologies that gave us places like Atlantis or the Underworld and gave us beloved characters like Achilles and Zeus and Socrates who journey from here to there or did this and that. And, I’m going to make the case that those mythologies are not just stories. They are riddles that belong to a broad and structured puzzle book. And, the King James Version of the Old Testament’s Book of Genesis is one such relic that emerged from the Mediterranean region in an era where the field of calendarics was at its pinnacle of popularity and that the Genesis stories and characters and their journeys and tales are not stories at all. They’re riddles whose solutions are extravagant cycles of time. I know, because I found, reconstructed, and solved the puzzles of Genesis.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was an accidental discovery and I didn&#39;t know it was a puzzle book. My specialty is calendars (old ones). I saw an olden calendar cycle but it  took four years and a general obsession to figure out why that cycle of time was in there and it&#39;s because it&#39;s a puzzle book.</p>

<p>Once I figured that out it then took six months to solve it. I was able to figure it out because some of the riddles are allegorical representations of old calendar cycles. I identified the calendaric riddles of Cain and Abel first and and then the Flood Narrative and the Abraham and it came together after that. </p>

<p>I left my comfy career for this four years ago to pursue my research. I take my claims very seriously. I want to be clear about that. </p>

<p>That&#39;s going to require a book to explain. In order to understand the solutions you have the undersrand the puzzles. </p>

<p>In a nutshell though, they are cycles of time that mathematically correlate to other cycles of time (i.e. similar number of days). For example:</p>

<p>8 solar years = 2,922 days
99 lunar months = 2,923 days
5 Venus Synodic Cycles = 2,919
13 Venus Orbits = 2,921 days</p>

<p>All 4 of those cycles show up as solutions in Genesis but there are many more such cycles (59 to be precise).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Break into multiple paragraphs. Each new point should start with a new paragraph. Never begin a sentence with &#39;And&#39; or &#39;But.&#39; There&#39;s some stylistic allowances, but as a general rule use a comma instead or remove the word altogether. </p>

<p>I would have to read this paragraph several times to understand it also, but I&#39;m not going to do that unless I&#39;m interested. You didn&#39;t grab my attention with anything, so I&#39;m not interested. The structure is pretty jacked up too. I&#39;m not sure if you were going for a certain style or tone, but it makes the whole thing more difficult to read. </p>

<p>Its too long. This a great for a rough draft, but making points clear and concise should be your end goal. </p>

<p>There&#39;s an enormous uphill to climb if you want to share information about the Bible, Zeus, Atlantis, the Underworld, and astrology. Avoiding those words might also be helpful. People scan things before reading them. Those were the words I saw when I first scanned it, which gives me a first impression that its full of shit. When coupled with bad grammar and sentence structure, there&#39;s no possible way I&#39;m going to read it. </p>

<p>These are my pointers, please don&#39;t take it to heart. I applaud anyone willing to put forth an effort in writing, as it is a very difficult task. I have been writing the same book for six years. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve been thinking about numbers and cycles and using them to track progress.</p>

<p>I believe our calendar and time systems, using numbers less than 60, condition people to focus on low magnitude numbers and thus keep people in a state of short term planning.  As a form of control.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey thanks. </p>

<p>That&#39;s an interesting concept about time. I don&#39;t know too much about small increments of time (less than one day) except that it&#39;s derived from astronomy in the following way:</p>

<p>360 degrees = 24 hours </p>

<p>360 degrees ÷ 24 h = 15 degrees of Earth&#39;s rotation occurs every 60 minutes (1 hr of time)</p>

<p>Which means 5 degrees of Earth&#39;s rotation occurs every 20 mins of time</p>

<p>Which means 1 degree of Earth&#39;s rotation occurs every 4 minutes of time </p>

<p>Which means 1/2  degree of Earth&#39;s rotation occurs every 2 minutes of time </p>

<p>Which means 1/4 degree of Earth&#39;s rotation occurs every 1 minutes of time </p>

<p>Which means 1/8 degree of Earth&#39;s rotation occurs every 30 seconds of time </p>

<p>That&#39;s about all I know. :)</p>
