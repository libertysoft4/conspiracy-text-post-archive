<blockquote>
<p><strong>If you dare oppose us in any way or form, we will destroy you right on spot. Now we will simply dox you and bust you in front of the public, but when the free western civilization crumbles, your family, your friends and you will be hunted and searched out based on internet history, and you, your friends, your family and everyone who dares speak against global tyranny will be sent to fema camps for possible re-education and fun.</strong></p>

<p>Be warned. This is a precedent.</p>

<p>The establishment are becoming more and more merciless.</p>

<p>Wake up and resist the new world order now...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reeeeeeeee! Fema Camps!  </p>

<p>I&#39;ve been hearing about this crap for the entire Obama Administration, and guess what... NOTHING HAPPENED.  </p>

<p>We have much bigger problems as a society than a troll being called out on his bullshit.  Who, by the way, folded like a cheap suit and practically begged CNN not to fully out him.  It is very easy to hide behind a keyboard and a username, and post ignorant shit on the internet.  He could not walk it how he talked it.  So, let&#39;s blame CNN anyway.</p>

<p>Regardless of what you may think about CNN, it is a part of a huge, money making conglomerate and is owned by Time Warner.  I think they went after him for the Star of David meme more than anything else.  You think that the FBI, CIA or Mossad doesn&#39;t know who this guy is already?  Or anyone else that says or does stupid shit against those of the Jewish faith?  You better believe that the Alphabet Agencies are aware of everyone&#39;s antics online, and you can thank GWB and the NSA for that.</p>

<p>Powerful people, with money, will defend themselves.  They&#39;re only willing to put up with so much bullshit then they&#39;re going to push back, either individually like they did with this guy, or collectively against all of us.  The lesson here is that actions have consequences.  People need to own the shit that they do, and not blame others for their own stupidity.  </p>

They might be using loosely defined &quot;hate speech&quot; laws in Europe to criminalize normal free speech, but the USA&#39;s a little bit different.

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s not free speech. That&#39;s literally censorship. Free speech is when you get to express your opinions free if consequences. Like if a feminist wants to say all men are evil, she should be able to say that without the fear of losing her job. Or if an atheist speaks out against the church they shouldn&#39;t be threatened or coerced into apologizing. If you think that people should face consequences for expressing opinions then that means you do not believe that free speech should be protected, you are advocating for censorship</p>

<p>No, no have a fundamentally flawed notion of &quot;free speech.&quot;  &quot;Free speech&quot; means the absence of prior restraint by the government or post-speech punishing to act as a chilling mechanism...by the government.  &quot;Free speech&quot; has nothing to do with how society chooses to interact with you based on your message.</p>

<p>Even a natural law concept of free speech would not recognize a right to consequence-free speech.

    <div class="md"><p>So, you are asserting some sort of right to free speech beyond that protected in the constitution?</p>

<p>Even a natural law concept of free speech would not recognize a right to consequence-free speech. Its one thing to prohibit government prior restraint or sanction of speech. &quot;Consequence free&quot; speech means preventing other citizens from criticizing speech they don&#39;t like and impinging upon others&#39; freedom of association.</p>
