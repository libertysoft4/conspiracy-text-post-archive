        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><strong>Korean War (1950-1953).</strong> Korea has been a unified country for thousands of years. Until the Americans invaded. Their rationale was that communism is evil. They pitted North and South to kill each other.</p>

<p><strong>Divide and Conquer.</strong> Every country is selfish and only cares about its own interests. America&#39;s interest was to divide and conquer Asia. To get Asians to  kill each other to weaken Asia as a whole. To destroy pan-Asianism. Because America knows it can&#39;t compete. </p>

<p><strong>North Korea&#39;s point of view.</strong> They are defending their countries from foreign invaders. They are isolationist, they want to be left alone. But America won&#39;t allow that.</p>

<p><strong>North Korea&#39;s poor conditions.</strong> Where did you hear that from? Bias western media of course. What about NK escapees, they claimed NK is evil too. Nope, they are bought out. They are paid to slander NK. Besides, all countries tortures people. As for starving and food shortage, plenty of poor countries have starving people. Being poor does not equate to being evil. </p>

<p><strong>South Kuckrea.</strong> They are pawns. Americans don&#39;t actually care about South Koreans. They are using South Koreans to kill their fellow brothers. South Kuckreans are the ultimate traitors. To suck up to the white man and stomping on fellow Asians. Common argument is that SK is a first country, NK is third world. People nowadays only care about money. Is being rich, soulless, and treasonous (SK) better than being poor, patriotic, and moral (NK)? Cause the latter holds better values.</p>

<p><strong>North Korean &quot;Threat&quot;.</strong> Completely ridiculous. Korea has never invaded any country for thousands of years. America invades them in 1950s. And now America says NK are the threat. WTF?</p>

<p><strong>Propaganda definition from Google.</strong> (information, especially of a biased or misleading nature, used to promote or publicize a particular political cause or point of view.) USA loves to say NK spreads propaganda to its people. Hypocrites! How come every media and information the west about NK is negative? Isn&#39;t that propaganda too. To brainwash Americans about this boogeyman.</p>

<p><strong>Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD).</strong> Not sure if NK actually has nukes. If they do thats fine. America has proven to be a threat to the Korean people. If the west is allowed nukes, so should NK. A common argument is that Kim Jong Un is crazy. Not true. If he was crazy he would have fired nukes already. The real crazy ones are Americans. Who have actually used nukes against its enemies.</p>

<p><strong>Bluff.</strong> We all know NK ain&#39;t gonna attack USA. It is not Korean foreign policy to invade and colonize. Its been like that for millenias. This is an excuse for America to invade. To spread &quot;freedom and democracy&#39;. &quot;They hate our freedom&quot;.</p>

<p><strong>South Korea rape hole.</strong> From 1950s-2017, American troops have rape South Korean women daily. They are never charged because they hold all the power. The SK government are puppets and cucks. Yet America is still claiming SK should direct its hate on NK. Zero North Koreans have raped South Korean women. </p>

<p><strong>Objectively</strong>. Judge for yourself. Cleanse yourself from all propaganda from both sides. Look at things neutrally. Not as an American. Not as North Korean. And you will see once and for all who are the good guys.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>China supports North Korea because it needs it as a buffer from American military power in South Korea and Japan. If the US fights North Korea, then we risk severe consequences from China--economic or worse. We won&#39;t do anything about North Korea no matter how much sabre-rattling is going on until we&#39;re ready to battle with China.</p>

<p>Additionally, <em>nobody</em> wants to deal with the massive refugee crisis that will happen if North Korea&#39;s government falls. China doesn&#39;t want that mess and neither does South Korea. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>All of the supposed defectors that I&#39;ve seen appear to be lying. They appear to either be actual defectors who were paid or pressured into lying, or South Koreans posing as North Korean defectors.<br/>
The first-hand accounts for which there is video evidence, rather than just someone&#39;s statement, just show a country that (again - in my opinion) has been forced into a state of relative poverty and militancy by a nearly constant western threat. If you look at North Korea in the 70&#39;s you can see the direction they were heading in. They would have developed into a modern enriched society. We got another glimpse of their true nature in the late 90&#39;s when Clinton established agreements with them which caused them to believe that the U.S. no longer wanted to destroy them.<br/>
The reality is that western powers will not tolerate any country that does not bend to their will; that does not permit the central banking system and western corporations to set up shop in their country.  This is why the U.S. military is currently being used to invade the Middle East. They are demonizing, invading and overthrowing the governments of every country that does not bend to the will of western powers. It has nothing to do with &#39;democracy&#39; or morals/ethics and never has. That is just what the CIA/Pentagon mouthpiece (mainstream media) tells us to keep us supporting their invasions and keep our children enlisting in the military.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Try to bump this to the top. Original OP&#39;s points are nearly spot on. I would say the poverty in North Korea is no myth. These missile tests may be a myth, or just the last jabs of the last nation willing to challenge the god (typo at first) ol&#39; USA.</p>

<p>Was thinking lately that part of the disconnect between american citizens had to do with all of us consciously or subconsciously knowing we are the bad guys </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a lot of military posturing on all sides right now but nobody wants a war in North Korea. They have artillery aimed at high population areas in South Korea that would cause mass casualties within minutes of a war started. </p>

<p>But North Korea is one of the worst places on earth to live. I&#39;d say they are close to Orwell&#39;s 1984. In their political prisons, it&#39;s even worse. <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11797365-escape-from-camp-14">This</a> is a good book to give you a glimpse inside of one. It&#39;s from a guy who was born in one of those prisons but made it out and eventually escaped.. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s get this straight.  The West has no humanitarian interest in helping the NK people from the NK regime.  None whatsoever.  They could care less about the suffering of the NK people.  They could care less about the suffering of any people in any country, including the US.  </p>

<p>It is all about power and control.  The West wants control of that region of land, and they want to create a Rothschild controlled central bank.  Same with Iran.  </p>

<p>Of course, WE care about he plight of the NK people because WE are not psychopaths.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with some of what you&#39;re saying. But you&#39;re off on a couple points. The US didn&#39;t invade Korea. Korea was split in two at the end of WWII when the US and Russian troops defeated the Japanese who had been occupying Korea. There was a race between the two new superpowers as everyone could see the end of WWII would mean a struggle for power beween the USSR and USA, and by proxy, Communism and Democracy.</p>

<p>The race ended with the two armies facing off at the 38th parallel, where the DMZ stands today. At the begining of the Korean war (which was importantly after the Chinese civil war had been won by the communists), the North invaded first and Allied US and SK forces were so unprepared we almost lost the whole penninsula before we start pushing the NK and Chinese &quot;volunteers&quot; back.</p>

<p>Although it&#39;s true that SK has a lot of problems with the government being corrupt, autocratic, etc. It isn&#39;t NK that is stopping SK from re-uniting with NK by force, at first it was the Soviets, and since the Korean war it also has been China. NK may not have raped as many South Koreans as US soldiers, but they are probably more concerned with the millions of troops just across the border than some rapes. </p>

<p>I think the main area that concerns this sub-Reddit is how artificial geo-political conflicts are and how the elite can change the lives of millions of people with the war on communism, &quot;domino effect&quot;, war on drugs, terror etc.</p>

<p>I also think it is important to see that some things in the world and history are just random chances and that not everything is tied to a vast conspiracy (probably will get downvoted for this). But I think the Korea situation is a great example of this, if Japan had surrendered a little later or anything else had changed about the situation, the country would have been divided up somewhere else or not at all and the situation today would have been completely different.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great post OP, thanks.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A common argument is that Kim Jong Un is crazy</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think a crazy regime with nuclear weapons would look like a mad dog. It would be threatening the whole world with policies such as &quot;if my regime goes down I blow up the whole world&quot;.  It&#39;d also be overtly practicing terrorism, lauding the psychological impact of the destruction it inflicts as legitimate deterrent.</p>

<p>NK doesn&#39;t fit the description. I can&#39;t seem to think of a regime that does. Oh <a href="https://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/world-report/articles/2016-03-31/case-for-irrationality-in-israels-nuclear-deterrence-and-defense-strategy">wait</a> ...

    <div class="md"><p>Keeping a state in a region slightly unstable or undemocratic increases the possibility of conflict and creates an us versus them situation where the US plays big brother and puts a military base on your land to keep the peace that they don&#39;t want to ever fully happen.

    <div class="md"><p>China supports North Korea because it needs it as a buffer from American military power in South Korea and Japan. If the US fights North Korea, then we risk severe consequences from China--economic or worse. We won&#39;t do anything about North Korea no matter how much sabre-rattling is going on until we&#39;re ready to battle with China.</p>

<p>Additionally, <em>nobody</em> wants to deal with the massive refugee crisis that will happen if North Korea&#39;s government falls. China doesn&#39;t want that mess and neither does South Korea. </p>
