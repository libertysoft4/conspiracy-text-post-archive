    <div class="md"><p>Religion is the end of love and honesty, the beginning of confusion; faith is a colorful hope or fear, the origin of folly. ~ Tao Te Ching</p>

<p>Secular schools can never be tolerated because such schools have no religious instruction, and a general moral instruction without a religious foundation is built on air; consequently, all character training and religion must be derived from faith ... we need believing people. ~ Adolf Hitler</p>

<p>A casual stroll through the lunatic asylum shows that faith does not prove anything. ~ Nietzsche</p>

<p>Invisible Pink Unicorns are beings of awesome mystical power. We know this because they manage to be invisible and pink at the same time. Like all religions, the Faith of the Invisible Pink Unicorns is based upon both logic and faith. We have faith that they are pink; we logically know that they are invisible because we can&#39;t see them. ~ Steve Eley</p>

<p>Faith is belief without evidence in what is told by one who speaks without knowledge, of things without parallel. ~ Ambrose Bierce</p>

<p>To use the term blind faith, is to use an adjective needlessly. ~ Julian Ruck</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Christ said that the old testament was spoken by him.  So if we follow Christ&#39;s words, we have to believe that the old testament was spoken by God.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil. (Matthew 5:17)</p>

<p>But a touching the resurrection of the dead, <strong>have ye not read that which was spoken unto you by God</strong>, saying, I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? God is not the God of the dead, but of the living. (Matthew 22:31-32)</p>

<p>Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father: there is one that accuseth you, even Moses, in whom ye trust. For <strong>had ye believed Moses, ye would have believed me: for he wrote of me. But if ye believe not his writings, how shall ye believe my words?</strong> (John 5:45-47)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe in Christs commandments, &#39;Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. This is the first and great commandment. And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.&#39; There is too many stories in the Bible that are there to confuse. Jesus&#39; words should be the basis for humanity but I believe there are evil forces at work in this world trying to make the human race forget that we all are actually working towards a common goal and that the bottom line is no matter how many physical differences there are between us we are all biologically the same.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Those laws were both given in the old testament.  To love the LORD thy God is the first of the ten commandments in Exodus 20.  Love thy neighbor as thyself is from Leviticus 19.  Those laws, while perfect, aren&#39;t much of a guide when there are people that think raping children is love.  You can&#39;t just say &quot;love, love, love&quot; and expect everything to work out because the wicked and depraved have a distorted view of what love is.  The rest of the Bible is needed in order to instruct one on how to love God and how to love one&#39;s neighbor.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t matter if we&#39;re biologically the same (which the Bible teaches we are, as it is written, God has made of one blood all nations of the earth), it matters whether we&#39;re spiritually the same.  It is the spirit that quickeneth, the flesh profiteth nothing.  What fellowship hath Christ with Belial?  One of the purposes of the Bible is to be a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.  If you throw it away, you are going to be blind to the truth.  Unable to discern that which is good from that which is evil.</p>

<p>I know that your god killed everyone on earth but noah and friends. for some stupid reason that didn&#39;t change anything.</p>

<p>I know that your god killed all the first born in egypt . . . really? all those bad babies!</p>

<p>What did satan do, oh yeah, offered jesus food and water when jesus was starving himself. OMG how evil is offering water to a thirsty man?!?!</p>

<p>I know your god killed a bunch of children for making fun of a bald man. So loving your god is.</p>

<p>You say your god is all powerful. If I had much more food and water than I could ever use, and I walked past a starving baby and did not give the baby food, What would you think of me. Your god does that thousands of times daily. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t miss god at all, but I sure miss santa claus.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But God is the mainstream religion. What if satan was demonized to protect God&#39;s evil reign over man? Satan is a banished fallen angel (declared such by God himself by the way) thats why he can&#39;t help with world hunger and such. God was able to defeat satan - though not able to destroy him entirely - so he instead banishes him to another plane, where satan is unable to help save mankind from the tyrant God and his elitist minions. Jesus was the son of satan, imbued with some of satans power (as satan was banished therefore unable to directly affect events) and sent to save us from materialism that is what are world is based on. Jesus, whilst successful in a sense, ultimately failed because the teachings were ignored, interpreted wrongly and Government/Capitalism became the new God.</p>

<p>One night I dreamed a dream.
As I was walking along the beach with my Lord.
Across the dark sky flashed scenes from my life.
For each scene, I noticed two sets of footprints in the sand,
One belonging to me and one to my Lord.</p>

I looked back at the footprints in the sand.
I noticed that at many times along the path of my life,

there was only one set of footprints.</p>

<p>This really troubled me, so I asked the Lord about it.
&quot;Lord, you said once I decided to follow you,
You&#39;d walk with me all the way.
But I noticed that during the saddest and most troublesome times of my life,
there was only one set of footprints.
I don&#39;t understand why, when I needed You the most, You would leave me.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He whispered, &quot;My precious child, I love you and will never leave you
Never, ever, during your trials and testings.
When you saw only one set of footprints,
It was then that I carried you.&quot;</p>

<p>There was also a man in the paper who worked undercover to rescue sex trafficking victims who got his courage from God. I thought that was pretty inspiring.</p>

<p>I felt bad reading the rough parts but I&#39;m glad you consider it a strength now.</p>

<p>2) I don&#39;t know lol, I wandered away from the path of God a long time ago in most aspects of life, might be best to call it a day on this little lamb.</p>

<p>3) Well I thought for a second that we bonded over our dislike of allsorts but maybe I jumped the gun.</p>

<p>10% isn&#39;t bad. That means 90 percent did like it!</p>

<p>You still haven&#39;t been very clear on where you stand regarding liquorice allsorts. I could never in good conscious &quot;Bond&quot; with someone who like allsorts. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Majority of the bible is how to be an obedient servant and fight for your monarch king on earth (because he has been ordained as a ruler by G). The Bible is the literal propaganda that was used by the ruling elites to justify their place as rulers for the past 1500 years. They need to re-write it to be more effectual propaganda for the post-democracy capitalist modern slave to relate to.</p>
