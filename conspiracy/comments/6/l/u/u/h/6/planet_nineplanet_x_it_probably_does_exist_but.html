        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Most of you conspirist probably know about Planet X. There has to be another planet in our solar system, because otherwise the orbits of neptune and uranus cant be explained. </p>

<p>Some believe Planet X has died (like flew into another planet and destroyed), others believe it makes a very long orbit around the sun and it returnes every 3600 years. They believe that the Babylonians called it Nibiru.</p>

<p>Now that are just two theories, it can still be something else. Like we cant see it just yet, or it just doesnt exist at all.. Anyways, the most probable thing is that is does exist. </p>

<p>It would be quite terrifying if this planet returnes, because that would mean a lot of earthquakes, tsunamis etc. Maybe even the destruction of mankind. </p>

<p>What do you conspirists think about this subject?</p>

<p>Here is some text from wikipedia about this:
Following the discovery of the planet Neptune in 1846, there was considerable speculation that another planet might exist beyond its orbit. The search began in the mid-19th century and culminated at the start of the 20th with Percival Lowell&#39;s quest for Planet X. Lowell proposed the Planet X hypothesis to explain apparent discrepancies in the orbits of the giant planets, particularly Uranus and Neptune,[1] speculating that the gravity of a large unseen ninth planet could have perturbed Uranus enough to account for the irregularities.[2]</p>

<p>Clyde Tombaugh&#39;s discovery of Pluto in 1930 appeared to validate Lowell&#39;s hypothesis, and Pluto was officially named the ninth planet. In 1978, Pluto was conclusively determined to be too small for its gravity to affect the giant planets, resulting in a brief search for a tenth planet. The search was largely abandoned in the early 1990s, when a study of measurements made by the Voyager 2 spacecraft found that the irregularities observed in Uranus&#39;s orbit were due to a slight overestimation of Neptune&#39;s mass.[3] After 1992, the discovery of numerous small icy objects with similar or even wider orbits than Pluto led to a debate over whether Pluto should remain a planet, or whether it and its neighbours should, like the asteroids, be given their own separate classification. Although a number of the larger members of this group were initially described as planets, in 2006 the International Astronomical Union reclassified Pluto and its largest neighbours as dwarf planets, leaving Neptune the farthest known planet in the Solar System.[4]</p>

<p>While today the astronomical community widely agrees that Planet X, as originally envisioned, does not exist, the concept of an as-yet-unobserved planet has been revived by a number of astronomers to explain other anomalies observed in the outer Solar System.[5] As of March 2014, observations with the WISE telescope have ruled out the possibility of a Saturn-sized object (95 Earth mass) out to 10,000 AU, and a Jupiter-sized (~318 Earth mass) or larger object out to 26,000 AU.[6]</p>

<p>In 2014, based on similarities of the orbits of a group of recently discovered extreme trans-Neptunian objects, astronomers hypothesized the existence of a super-Earth planet, 2 to 15 times the mass of the Earth and beyond 200 AU with possibly a high inclined orbit at some 1500 AU.[7] In 2016 further work showed this unknown distant planet is likely on an inclined, eccentric orbit that goes no closer than about 200 AU and no further than about 1600 AU from the Sun. The orbit is predicted to be anti-aligned to the clustered extreme trans-Neptunian objects.[8] Because Pluto is no longer considered a planet by the International Astronomical Union, this new hypothetical object has become known as Planet Nine.[9]</p>

<p>If you have a telescope(even a relative weak one) I suggest comparing it to normal stars. You will spot a blurry disc right objects rather then points like a normal far away star. </p>

<p>While you are at it, take a telescopic view of the moon. Even a low power telescope makes the moon amazing to view especially if you catch cool stuff like craters at day/night break. You can see parts of the crater illuminated in the dark side.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That sounds like Mars, with its sand with rusted iron giving off the reddish hue. You have a good eye, it&#39;s hard for me to tell the colors without a telescope.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure what you are asking about a unique orbit. Venus and Mars both orbit the sun and are pretty close to a circular orbit(It&#39;s slightly elliptical) around the sun firmly in the solar plane only a few degrees tilted.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There were a few nights when it appeared to be moving alongside with the moons orbit, which is around the Earth, why would this planet be following the same orbit path if it orbits the sun? Was it just a coincidence?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great observation! The moon orbits the Earth in the same plane as the planets orbit the sun(each object has a few degrees inclination which is why it&#39;s not aligned, and when they do align we have eclipses.) Venus and Mars both follow this plane(There are other irregular inclinations for objects in our solar system and further planets tend to have more inclination.)</p>

<p>This means that the planets, moon, and sun take similiar paths in the sky! However the planets don&#39;t orbit us, so what you will see is planets raising into the sky on the moons path and then reverse along a close path. This is due to the Earths rotation and the moons orbit of us.</p>

<p>Venus is closer to the sun, so a lot of the time it&#39;s actually hidden to us by the suns light. Venus is most prominent when it is offset from us so we are looking at it when it&#39;s to the sides of the sun in its orbit. This is why it is so prominent the last half a year. </p>

<p>Mars is further away from us so we can see it during much of its orbit.</p>

<p>I suggest finding videos, it&#39;s hard to explain in writing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You might mean like the 2012 Mayan calendar, and the 2015 blood moons, and now the 2017 Aug eclipse.  But the star layout described in Revelation 12 is a very very rare layout.  As a non believer, I had to say I was impressed enough to consider the odds or coincidence.</p>

<p>Sounds like you might find it at a minimum interesting.  Google &#39;sept 23 2017 Revelation 12&#39; for more info.  Some good 5 minute YouTube primers on it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s new evidence always poping up for it. This article proposes one reason we have not found it yet.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But why haven&#39;t astronomers observed a ninth planet directly? Volk and Malhotra say scientists haven&#39;t looked that hard. Most sky surveys avoid the crowded orbital plane to gain unfettered views of the universe beyond our solar system.</p>

<p>Researchers hope the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, which is scheduled to make its first observations in 2020, will help scientists solve the mystery of the missing ninth planet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That sounds like Mars, with its sand with rusted iron giving off the reddish hue. You have a good eye, it&#39;s hard for me to tell the colors without a telescope.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure what you are asking about a unique orbit. Venus and Mars both orbit the sun and are pretty close to a circular orbit(It&#39;s slightly elliptical) around the sun firmly in the solar plane only a few degrees tilted.</p>
