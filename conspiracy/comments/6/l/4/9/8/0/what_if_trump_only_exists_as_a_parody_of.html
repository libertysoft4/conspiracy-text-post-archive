    <div class="md"><p>Yes. The right fails to notice that Trump is motivating an unequal and opposite reaction in the left. Expect a hard liberal shift within the next few years as conservatives fail to recapture his base and liberals vote for anything blue. </p>

<p>This combination of bombastic personality and politics only works when things get done. Trump failing so hard with a stacked deck will only work in liberals&#39; favor. Who knows, maybe he <em>is</em> a useful tool to break the back of this rightward trend before it gets real teeth. </p>

<p>Either way, folks had to be real gullible to vote for an obvious old fraud, all policies aside. We deserve what we get for neglecting critical thinking in so many. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m a Bernie supporter (I do realize anyone can be compromized/blackmailed/restrained/silenced but believe he had good intentions if he&#39;s allowed).</p>

<p>I always ALWAYS saw Trump as a conman just as I saw Alex Jones as a conman, trying to make conspiracy theorists look crazy.
Now, maybe Trump is just like that (acts a bit....uh....stupid I guess)
and maybe I&#39;m wrong to judge him, maybe that&#39;s how he really is like....but I tend to think it was an incredibly obvious act.
An act to make people think he&#39;s harmless or something.
Anyway, I don&#39;t believe in conservativism,
people will react badly to this,
but it&#39;s an ideology born of the establishment, especially NEOconservativism which is conservativism on steroids.</p>

<p>Conservativism = conserving a low waged population / status quo.
People just defend it usually because of the talking points of &quot;freedom/conservative morals and values&quot; and other crap.
It&#39;s cheap talk from lying politicians.
I honestly think it&#39;s a scam if you look at conservative policies.
Some people get overly offended at my criticism towards conservativism because for some reason, people consider it a cultural thing....but I remind them that it&#39;s 100% politics and that you shouldn&#39;t be emotional about politics.
That opens people up to manipulation.</p>

<p>Sure, some people may be right leaning here and there,
but conservativism is generally VERY anti-worker
and most people in the U.S. are workers so....you can see why I&#39;m frustrated at how many people think conservativism = good and liberalism = bad.</p>

<p>Even what the corporate media calls &quot;liberal V conservative&quot;
is actually the more messed up NEOliberal V NEOconservative crap.
And liberal doesn&#39;t even mean left wing, technically.
Just means it has at least a little left leaning stuff like LGBT rights and so on...
So extreme right winger Hillary Clinton is actually a NEOlib and NEOcon but gets away
with calling herself a liberal just because of LGBT rights and pro-choice on abortion....still
doesn&#39;t make her anywhere near left wing/Bernie Sanders like.</p>

<p>Hope I&#39;m making sense.
A lot of Christian conservative politicians are dishonest to the people,
some aren&#39;t even religious men and pretend to be,
let alone the fact Jesus would be a socialist lol,
he would never blame the poor for &quot;being lazy&quot; as being the cause of their situation.
It&#39;s ridiculous.
Hope what I&#39;m saying is fair.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If so it is working Lol. No president has ever been more mocked or disrespected by a large mass of people in every country. I hate trump not for who he is as a person because I do not know the guy but because he incites the worst in people. I for the first time ever went to the trump reddit, and found comment among comment of men talking about rapping woman, calling them pigs and chimps, and talking about cuckolding liberal uncivilized woman. It was fucking disturbing. I left a comment stating how happy I was the general age range of trump supporters is older and will most likely die within the next 20-30 years. I got banned for threatening them and when I replied to the mod about it the mod banned me from messaging mods of that sub. So if this what they are trying to do making conservatives, republicans, and now conspicary theorist (most conservatives weren&#39;t theorist before trump which is weird but a rant for a different time) look bad then it is exponentially effective. </p>
