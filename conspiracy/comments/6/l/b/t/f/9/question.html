<blockquote>
<p>&quot;And a great sign appeared in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars. 2 She was pregnant and was crying out in birth pains and the agony of giving birth. 3 And another sign appeared in heaven: behold, a great red dragon, with seven heads and ten horns, and on his heads seven diadems. 4 His tail swept down a third of the stars of heaven and cast them to the earth.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I question whether the USA has enough forces to fight an all-out war (and keep the many other war zones going in Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan, Yemen).  Both troops and weapons supplies are strectched thin right now; the troops are tired from almost 2 decades of bullshit, useless wars and the jet fighters which the forces have are behind schedule and in short supply (many jet fighters life spans are being extended &amp; re-equipped).  </p>

<p>If there ever was an actual Hot War against a formidable opponent--the USA would need a False Flag event to help recruit soldiers (or they would have to bring the draft back).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The book is like an advanced intelligence channeling to god directly. I didn&#39;t believe it myself until I read all 9 books in the set and realized the book was in fact passing a wealth of unknown secrets of the human mind which I experimented with and found it all worked as described. </p>

<p>It is sort of like a religious book but the book explains that primitive humans haven&#39;t understood the true meaning of religion. I used to think religion was demanding, cheesy, stoic, sacrificial, and downright difficult but this book enlightened me to understand that true religion is a mind blowing experience full of adventure which I now believe. Religion turns into a sort of Neo training adventure like in the movie &quot;the matrix&quot;. The limits are endless. Religion constantly empowers mankind but since we are primitive, we simply have no idea what we are doing.  Religion is evolutionary and this book was channeled to a homeless man through something in the mind called a thought adjuster. Humans can all connect with this thought adjuster but they don&#39;t know how. The thought adjuster is a fragment of god giving god a front row seat into your life and it gives humans all the best advice but humans don&#39;t know how to listen to it yet as we are an evolving species. </p>

<p>It talks a lot about the cabal. One thing it says is that if we knew how much wealth and technology the cabal was holding from us, we would kill them with our bare hands. It also warned against global warming back in 1994. </p>

<p>The book clears up most human questions in a logical that makes perfect sense including Gods master plan which would take me 15 hours to explain verballly. All I can say is the master plan is so ingenious that it makes all the suffering well worth it although all suffering avoidable. That is the quest. Decend into dumb, whimpy human form, land on a rock without previous memory, and turn life into a paradise through the process of evolution. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel much, much more empowered but there are 2 types of power kind of like you see in Star Wars. Light power which is the power to build and dark power which is the power to enslave. The book guides people on how to use light power but light power is so utterly complex and so many things need to be understood. This book series is about 3200 pages long in high school language but if anyone reads it all up, they become empowered. If we all read it, we would see world peace within weeks. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>How can you say it was channeled &#39;directly from God&#39;?  </p>

<p>You do know God and Jesus warned against all this kind of stuff (channeling, magic, divination etc).  We were also told that anything that goes against God&#39;s word, be it from an angel of heaven or a man, was a lie.  Then you have the fact Lucifer himself can appear as an angel of light, as can his minions.  </p>

<p>So my question would be,: how can you trust what it says?  Just because it makes sense to you does not make it true.  You mention in another comment that you believe in God so how do you reconcile that belief with accepting channeling etc as real?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I once read one of those secret space program interviews where channeling were brought up and the person asked, &quot;How do we know if we are reading a real of fake channeling.&quot; The answer was: If you feel extremely inspired and notice that the information is quite novel then its real.&quot; </p>

<p>Its very difficult to describe this unless you read it. There are some hard core secrets in these books that can be verified in our own personal lives to experience. </p>

<p>The Bible isn&#39;t the &quot;end all&quot; to holy books. The government wants us to think that so that we don&#39;t expand and evolve religion. Religion is evolutionary. It has to always evolve. One of the big parts of life is to have an adventure where we forget everything and rediscover it all again. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>&quot;How do we know if we are reading a real of fake channeling.&quot;  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I wasn&#39;t asking that.  I was asking how you know the entity they are communicating with is good? God does not send messages by channeling and specifically warns against it.  Therefore the message being received does not come from God.  </p>

<p>Do you know what forces like to imitate God and spread a corrupted version of his Word?  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Bible isn&#39;t the &quot;end all&quot; to holy books. The government wants us to think that   </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sorry but this whole paragraph is wrong.  The bible has been pushed out and denigrated precisely because tptb don&#39;t want people turning to it.  It&#39;s being replaced with a load new-age/alternative philosophies, just look at the United Nations.<br/>
Do you know where the new age movement comes from?<br/>
It&#39;s closely associated with occultists/secret-societies.  Most of them admitted luciferians.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wouldn&#39;t agree with you if you told me this years ago. The messages in the book are so pure and associated with every pure emotion like love, unity, freedom ect..and there is no red flags at all. I would think if this was a satanic channeling, there would be at least one evil element in the book but there isn&#39;t. </p>

<p>Honestly, if you are up to it, I would give it a shot or at least read the Amazon reviews here:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Complete-Conversations-Neale-Donald-Walsch/dp/0399153292#customerReviews">https://www.amazon.com/Complete-Conversations-Neale-Donald-Walsch/dp/0399153292#customerReviews</a></p>

<p>(Note: it is a 9 part book. That link shows 1-3 only). </p>
