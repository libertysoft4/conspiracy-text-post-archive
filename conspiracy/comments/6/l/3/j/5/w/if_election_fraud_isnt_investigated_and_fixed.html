    <div class="md"><p>Would you prefer that the same NFL or NBA team wins EVERY game?</p>

<p>You&#39;re advocating for letting the winner be whoever wins over California and New York in every election.</p>

<p>So, do you just want liberals in power forever?</p>

<p>Do you want an economy more like California?</p>

<p>Do you want gun control laws like New York? Does that make sense in Alaska?</p>

<p>The reason we have the system set up like this is because each state is supposed to have it&#39;s on way of life, and their separate input matters more than each individual I&#39;m the country.</p>

<p>Otherwise you end up with everyone in Alaska dying unarmed from predators, and their vote will never matter so there&#39;s nothing they can do about it.</p>

<p>Now, the system is pretty fucky since the states have been robbed of their individual peer to a certain extent, but the point remains...</p>

<p>Do you really want California and New York to choose everything for everyone in America forever? </p>

<p>I certainly fucking don&#39;t. I&#39;m very thankful there&#39;s a chance to override a shit vote due to two highly populated, extremely insulated, like-minded individuals. </p>

<p>There&#39;s a reason people outside of those areas aren&#39;t as liberal. Life is different, and I don&#39;t think we should ignore the fact that the political pendulum swings in a very balanced manner in this country. I think it&#39;s better than having the same team win every game, personally.</p>

<p>You mean a state with the 5th largest economy in the world? Yeah I&#39;ll take that over my native Idaho, who receives 78 cents for every dollar we put into the federal government.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, I may be misled on California&#39;s current economic standing.</p>

<p>I still don&#39;t want the two biggest population centers choosing the president every time, and I&#39;m certainly not alone in that.</p>

<p>If you want it changed, feel free to lobby for it. Protest. Organize with people who agree with you and try to actually do something about it.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I highly doubt fifty percent of the country wants that change, so you&#39;ll have to just accept it forever. Because they&#39;ll always vote the same way. And your voice will never matter.</p>

<p>Just like what you want for states that aren&#39;t California or New York! Sucks ass, right?</p>

<p>Luckily we have representatives to condense the vote and give your side a better chance.</p>

<p>Just like the electoral college does for elections.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t have to agree. You don&#39;t have to like it. You do have to get over it or do something about it. Crying on Reddit didn&#39;t change my mind, and I doubt it influenced anyone who has any understanding of the subject.</p>

<p>Sorry your side lost in 1787. Maybe you&#39;ll have a better chance this time around.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know what?</p>

<p>I take it back. I&#39;m sorry for being an arrogant prick. </p>

<p>While I can&#39;t say I&#39;ve definitively changed my mind, it&#39;s clear as it ever will be that I need to educate myself more on this topic before I open my mouth about it, lol.</p>

<p>I&#39;m usually not this adamant about my opinions, either. I guess somewhere some sort of brainwashing/biased talk must have hit me hard.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll reexamine my opinion and refrain from talking about this until I have a more thorough understanding of it.</p>

<p>Again, sorry for being a dick. Thanks for bringing new information to light for me. Have a good one, bro.</p>
