        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;m not really for Communism or any particular system, but I feel like people in America are sort of brainwashed that it&#39;s bad without really being given logical arguments or all the facts. I feel like people love to point out that every previous Communist system have failed as evidence that the system itself doesn&#39;t work. </p>

<p>But this makes no sense, if you build an electronic airplane using material A and none of the airplanes with that material work, and then you build another airplane with material B and it <em>does</em> work, that does not mean that material B is superior. What if the way the plane was built is entirely different? What if the person controlling the airplane is different? What if the person who built the airplane was better trained...</p>

<p>My point is that you can&#39;t say for sure that the economic system is the reason it failed without presenting an argument that <em>the system</em> is what caused it to fail more than anything else, because of how many factors are at play in real life. And because we can&#39;t really &quot;control for variables&quot; as the world happens in real time, we have to have well thought out arguments and look back at why these things really happened (sort of like controlling for variables in retrospect). Yet, everyone likes to pretend that because countries with communist systems failed, it <em>had</em> to be the system that caused it, even though by itself this makes no sense.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying that these well reasoned arguments aren&#39;t out there (so if you have them, please share), I just hate the &quot;anti-Communism&quot; propaganda mindset that we seem to have by default.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not pretending to know much about social/economic systems here, but I also know that most people don&#39;t and still like to shit on Communism for no reason. It&#39;s stupid and it tilts me.</p>

<p>Because that is not possible. I suppose you could just dope society up, but then we are heading into a dystopian society. Look into the movies/books Equilibrium and the Giver.</p>

<p>Like I said, corruption exists within all systems because of humans.</p>

<p>People are. Not all though.</p>

<p>If it involves a State then yes, imo.</p>

<p>A State inherently means Authority and rulership. Remember, Power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely. There is also this case. Say we have a benevolent monarch, unless he/she lives forever there is no way to know whether the heir will be benevolent or malevolent. Because of human nature.</p>

<p>If the US truly had checks and balances we would not be here talking about how messed up the situation is, now would we? Think about it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe that was a bit too strong - it has its place in resistance. If I understand voluntarism correctly, it&#39;s deliberate non-cooperation with the state and other institutions of coercion? Which, yes, has its place. Then we face the question of how to understand and overcome - how to democratise - the other forces that shape our daily existence. How could we refuse cooperation with an economic order that is so total, so all-encompassing?</p>

<p>Or maybe I&#39;ve misunderstood the meaning of voluntarism in this sense?</p>

<p>It&#39;s equally wrong to believe that individual rights are adequately upheld under capitalism. Moreover, the kind of individualism that flourishes under capitalism is damaging for society: by overlooking the relationships between individuals and groups that create strong communities, and responding in the main to the power of money, we destroy the basis on which persons can truly flourish.</p>

<p>It is bad actors that fail the community. Not community failing an ideology.</p>

<p>Different types of governments are all <em>idealized</em> visions of a way a state could function to provide liberty and a flourishing community. Hell, if Communism, Capitalism, Socialism, or Authoritarianism had incorruptible leaders and communities they would each be a utopia.</p>

<p>No government works because no person is incorruptible. It&#39;s the sad truth of society that low to no government is the best realistic method to assure liberty of the individual.</p>

<p>Is that to say that it was randomness that put certain good people or bad people in power? Just a thought. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem is communism is that it eats away at the idea of private property or you owning something. If you belong to the State or you own nothing because everyone owns it..who gets to decide what you own? Forced redistribution of all land and property...for the good of the national community.</p>

<p>What incentive is there for someone to do the jobs no one likes? Which brings me to the point of having to force people to do the jobs that we require that no one wants to do. Also there is no real incentive to work harder since everyone is given an &#39;equal share&#39;.</p>

<p>Communism kills creative thinking such as there is no real value in a poet of painter as there is for say a builder. </p>

<p>Communism itself does not erase class struggle, as it would suggest, but it adds to it. Someone obviously has to be in charge, there has to be leaders. Chances are that group enjoy its power and maintaining it. Look at the Russian revolution in 1905, 1917 ,Chinese 1949, and Cuban revolutions. All of these fought against an elitist upper class that they preached against.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t forget the millions of people that died to Communist rule. Stalin alone murdered about 20 million.</p>

<p>Human beings are entitled to their human rights; which consist of you owning yourself and your property, right to be free, and the right to defend yourself. All which Communism take away to a certain degree. </p>

<p>There is nothing wrong with Capitalism. All Capitalism is an exchange of goods for another. I trade you something you want, and you give me something I want. What is wrong with that? What we have now is what most enlightened individuals on the subject would call &#39;Crony-Capitalism&#39;. We don&#39;t have real free-trade with all these regulations and taxes.
