        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>

<p>For many years, I believed that all should have the right to do what they want as long as it made them happy, and as long it did not “harm” anyone – abortion, sexuality, and other issues are areas I took this stance. Now, please note, I never want to “push” my beliefs on anyone reading. It is probably clear from my post history that I have certain views, but in the end, no matter what you believe, I am always willing to hear other opinions. On top of that, even if you do not believe in God or are not religious/spiritual, I still feel you can see the point I am trying to make with this post. The philosophy of “Do what thou wilt” is prominent in our world right now, and I feel that it is ultimately harming everybody. To me, this phrase is disguised in other ways, such as “one love”, “peace”, and other phrases, but the point is the same.  Ultimately, it is the belief that people should just love one another, do what makes them happy, and the world will be great...right?</p>

<p><strong>A Hypothetical God Would Have Standards</strong></p>

<p>Even if you do not believe in God, let’s pretend there is a hypothetical God for a moment. When arguing online basically as my second job (just kidding!), I run across this argument over and over again – how can God be a good God when he has certain rules about who people can love, how people can live, and what people should do? Before, I agreed with this sentiment. If God really loved us, he would certainly accept us for who we are, but there is an answer to this argument that I feel people overlook.</p>

<p>God has standards because he <em>is</em> loving. When you love somebody in a relationship of any sort, whether it be your child, your spouse, or your friend, standards are used in a loving way. When we really love our children, we set boundaries and rules because we want them to live good and valuable lives. Not only have I been in an abusive relationship with no standards, but as a teacher, I have seen the results when parents do not have standards for their children. It never fails – the child who does not have rules at home or a guiding force to help them goes astray, and their life is extremely difficult. More than ever, people are loosening their standards with their children. A quick google search shows how parents have more difficulty disciplining children, and more and more parents want friendships with their children:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1251426/Modern-parents-avoid-discipline-fear-upsetting-children.html">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1251426/Modern-parents-avoid-discipline-fear-upsetting-children.html</a></p>

<p>From my personal experience, students end up on a hard path, where it is difficult for them to distinguish between right and wrong. </p>

<p>God has standards of right and wrong for us because, ultimately, it can be difficult, at times, to distinguish what is right and wrong in our society, especially when more and more is being considered “good.” At the same time, God realizes that we may not live up to these standards, and this is where grace and forgiveness comes in. Is that not the same as what a good parent, teacher, or friend would do? We set standards for those we love, but we also know they we may not live up to those standards at all times. But, again, even if you do not believe in God, our society should still have standards because people need guidance. Family structures are there (or used to be there) to perpetuate standards so that people can live good lives.</p>

<p><strong>Do What Thou Wilt</strong></p>

<p>In 1978, Aleister Crowley stated that “Do what thou wilt is the whole of the law.” Here is a great article for more information about his ties to the elite and the propagation of concept of &quot;thelema&quot;:</p>

<p><a href="https://vigilantcitizen.com/hidden-knowledge/aleister-crowley-his-story-his-elite-ties-and-his-legacy/">https://vigilantcitizen.com/hidden-knowledge/aleister-crowley-his-story-his-elite-ties-and-his-legacy/</a></p>

<p>The article states, “Book of the Law became the basis of Thelema, which revolved around three key philosophical ideas:
1- Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law;
2- Love is the law, Love under will;
3- Every man and every woman is a star.”</p>

<p>These concepts are certainly propagated by the media and society, today though we might just hear them in slightly different ways. To me, phrases like <em>equality</em>, no boundaries, one love, and others exemplify this philosophy.</p>

<p>Of course, I am not dismissing that these concepts come into play at times, but should they really be the whole of the law?</p>

<p>By the way, the &quot;whole of the law&quot; in the bible is to love God with all your heart and soul and your mind, and to treat others how you want to be treated (Matthew 22:37-39). </p>

<p>What feels different about these phrases to you?</p>

<p><strong>Who needs God?</strong></p>

<p>Who needs God when people can worship themselves? Social media is not going away, and while we often hear about its downfalls, it is entirely unlikely that people are going to throw away the tool where they have an audience that watches and worships them. Instead of the standard of humility being promoted, people are engaging in full narcissism – to the point where people die while taking selfies, for example.</p>

<p>This is another area where I argue with people a lot online. When the topic of “Satanism” gets brought up, I hear it over and over again. The argument is that Satanism is not <em>really</em> the worship of the devil. Rather, it is a philosophy for those who despise anti-intellectualism and want to live the best lives for themselves. Still, These are the nine Satanic statements, and they tell a different story: </p>

<p>&quot;- Satan represents indulgence instead of abstinence. - Satan represents vital existence instead of spiritual pipe dreams. - Satan represents undefiled wisdom instead of hypocritical self-deceit. - Satan represents kindness to those who deserve it instead of love wasted on ingrates. - Satan represents vengeance instead of turning the other cheek. - Satan represents responsibility to the responsible instead of concern for psychic vampires. - Satan represents man as just another animal, sometimes better, more often worse than those that walk on all-fours, who, because of his &quot;divine spiritual and intellectual development&quot;, has become the most vicious animal of all. - Satan represents all of the so-called sins, as they all lead to physical, mental, or emotional gratification. - Satan has been the best friend the Church has ever had, as He has kept it in business all these years.&quot; </p>

<p><a href="http://www.religionfacts.com/church-satan">http://www.religionfacts.com/church-satan</a></p>

<p>When I read this, I just see pure selfishness. Whether or not one believes in an actual Satanic figure, the point is that the worship of oneself is Satanic in its roots. No matter how people try to twist Satanism into something positive, the roots are selfish. </p>

<p>I find it interesting that many atheists seem to revere the Church of Satan, stating that it is simply just “anti-theism” in order to promote progress and intellectualism in our society.</p>

<p>To me, people are being fooled into believing that Satanism is good because there are no standards, and people can have the freedom to just be themselves, to do what the want, and as always, we should accept them! People are good as they are, so nobody should have to work to be better, right? </p>

<p>People often try to distinguish Anton Lavey’s Satanism from “other types” of Satanism, not realizing they are falling into a trap. There is much more that can be said here, but you have to really ask yourself, why is it necessary, for example, to promote Satanic clubs in schools? Is there a way to promote intellectualism and secularism without a Satanic club?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/satanist-club-coming-to-oregon-elementary-schools-w442467">http://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/satanist-club-coming-to-oregon-elementary-schools-w442467</a></p>

<p>What really is the agenda here? Many might claim that the use of the term “Satan” is an advertising technique, but I feel there is something more sinister going on, and I think it is expressed in our current society right now.</p>

<p><strong>Sexuality in our Brave New World</strong></p>

<p>Aleister Crowley is the modern founder of occultism, and sex magick, particularly homosexual sex magick, were strongly promoted by him. Crowley introduced sex as a sacrament in western culture, and Theodur Reuss explains its ties to Masonic beliefs:</p>

<p><em>[T]he science of the sexual magic is the key to the development and the underlying secret of all Masonic  symbols.…[I]t is certain that the sexual question has become the most burning question of our time.</em></p>

<p><a href="http://www.esoteric.msu.edu/VolumeV/Unleashing_the_Beast.htm">http://www.esoteric.msu.edu/VolumeV/Unleashing_the_Beast.htm</a></p>

<p>It is important to explore sex magick, especially homosexual magick on your own, because there is no way I could cover it all in this post. However, it is clear that child abuse, pedophilia, and sex magick or directly correlated, and if you are interested, you can read about how the Talmud (the body of Jewish civil and ceremonial law) and pedophilia (and other sexual taboos) are connected:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.dailystormer.com/talmud-pedophilia-the-jewish-religion-allows-sex-with-3-year-old-baby-girls-and-little-boys-under-nine/">https://www.dailystormer.com/talmud-pedophilia-the-jewish-religion-allows-sex-with-3-year-old-baby-girls-and-little-boys-under-nine/</a></p>

<p>The point here is that these modern ideas about sex are not new, and going back to my introduction, they are entirely without standards. Here are some modern views of sexuality, gender identity, and gender norms in our society:</p>

<p>• Sex positivity: Hook up culture and “anything goes” is what it is all about. Go to <a href="/r/sex">/r/sex</a> right now, and know that they promote a sex positive attitude. More and more millennials are having casual sex, but they have fewer long-term partners:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.latimes.com/science/sciencenow/la-sci-sn-millennials-sex-attitudes-20150508-story.html">http://www.latimes.com/science/sciencenow/la-sci-sn-millennials-sex-attitudes-20150508-story.html</a></p>

<p>No sex is bad sex, either, as long as it does not “harm” anyone.
This standard though, separates sex from “love” and it seems to actually become something more of a “ritual” and “empowerment” for people.</p>

<p>• Abortions are cool now: I know that we all have our own moral beliefs about abortions, and honestly, I am morally against them but not necessarily legally. Whatever your view though, isn’t it strange how having an abortion is directly tied to female empowerment? </p>

<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/06/victory-abortion-rights-empowered-polish-women">https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/06/victory-abortion-rights-empowered-polish-women</a></p>

<p>In the past, abortion was seen as an “end of the rope” kind of situation, and it was certainly not glorified. Now, recently, I read an article where it stated that women should not be forced to carry out pregnancies. There was just something so strange about that statement to me, and it felt different than the concept of having an abortion because you were raped. Again, there is a removal of standards here – the idea that anyone can and should have an abortion is empowering versus the idea abortion should be done only in extreme situations.</p>

<p>• Gender and sex: It is important to note that I do understand the difference between gender and sex. Gender usually has ties to social and cultural differences, and sex is biological. It is important to note, too, that there <em>is</em> a biological element of gender, most importantly, among other factors, that is our sex organs. When I saw the article about a Canadian baby not being given a “gender statement”, I honestly felt a little sick:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/07/04/health/canadian-baby-gender-designation/index.html">http://www.cnn.com/2017/07/04/health/canadian-baby-gender-designation/index.html</a></p>

<p>Again, lines are being blurred further and further, and now we are telling people, there are no standards – they can raise their kids how they want, and they can be whoever the want to be – male, female, firetruck, whatever.</p>

<p>On top of this gender confusion, children are exposed to sexuality at younger and younger ages, and there are consequences:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/real-healing/201208/overexposed-and-under-prepared-the-effects-early-exposure-sexual-content">https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/real-healing/201208/overexposed-and-under-prepared-the-effects-early-exposure-sexual-content</a></p>

<p>It is important to note that I do not personally care what people identify with, but when something is propagated by the media continually, we have to ask ourselves why. On top of that, even if we feel it is not harming anybody, we are now letting children to make choices before they even can understand the complexities of sex, gender, biology, etc. I really want you to think about this 4-year-old that went through a sex change procedure:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.wnd.com/2016/09/child-4-worlds-youngest-ever-sex-change-patient/">http://www.wnd.com/2016/09/child-4-worlds-youngest-ever-sex-change-patient/</a></p>

<p>I go back to this point a lot, but would you even allow a child get a tattoo? Why are we letting children make these life-altering decisions.</p>

<p>The conspiracy here is a breakdown of our identities, our gender roles, our family structures, our society, and our standards. When we say we are not harming anyone, are we allowing others to unknowingly harm themselves? Can a child grasp the gravity of sex change surgery? Can they even count or read yet?
Welcome to our Brave New World, where promiscuity is encouraged, sex is encouraged at an early age, and there are “no favorites.” </p>

<p><em>Everyone belongs to everyone else</em> (Brave New World, pg. 40)</p>

<p><strong>Other Standards</strong></p>

<p>Also, before you argue with me about the gender identity thing, there is much research about the biological ties to gender:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/02/150213112317.htm">https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/02/150213112317.htm</a></p>

<p>Woman and men <em>are</em> different, and it is not just because society tells them they are. Gender roles are supposed to be a reflection of our biology. Now, that is being completely twisted.</p>

<p>Sex is obviously a huge topic, but we cannot forget that other standards in our culture are being eradicated.</p>

<p>And, there is definitely a lean toward the acceptance of pedophilia, beastiality, incest, and other taboos...</p>

<p>But here are others:</p>

<p>• Health – It is not secret that many succumb to gluttony. By the way, I am not blaming individuals, and there are many factors involved, but we live in a strange culture now. I see a lot of memes from my students about glorifying a strange relationship with food. Food is a solace for many, and it is contributing to declining health. In fact, this may be the first generation to die younger than their parents:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/17/health/childrens-life-expectancy-being-cut-short-by-obesity.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/17/health/childrens-life-expectancy-being-cut-short-by-obesity.html</a></p>

<p>• Education – This one is a tricky subject, and while many more are going to college, I feel that most are not learning, but really being indoctrinated. Reading is no longer a pastime, and in my opinion, people are losing critical thinking skills. I know this is the huffington post, but there are many forms of research about an overall decline in intelligence:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/22/people-getting-dumber-human-intelligence-victoria-era_n_3293846.html">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/22/people-getting-dumber-human-intelligence-victoria-era_n_3293846.html</a></p>

<p>The culprit, in my opinion, is technology. Instead of people using technology (for the most part) to learn and grow, people are using technology to be entertained. We are amusing ourselves to death:</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amusing_Ourselves_to_Death">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amusing_Ourselves_to_Death</a></p>

<p>And while many complain that education is worse than ever (and it is), in my opinion, parents are, too. When teachers try to enforce expectations and standards, parents cry out and protest. They do not want their children working too hard in school, but at the same time, they want their little boy or girl (or whatever gender they identify with) to feel special!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2011/09/06/living/teachers-want-to-tell-parents/index.html">http://www.cnn.com/2011/09/06/living/teachers-want-to-tell-parents/index.html</a></p>

<p>By the way, I am lucky that I genuinely have a wonderful relationship with parents, but across the country, more and more teachers are leaving the profession, and I have no doubt part of it has to do with parents expecting more out of teachers and less out of their children.</p>

<p>By the way, there are definitely masonic links to our modern education system. Of course, I cannot find the research I need for this now, but if anybody is aware, please comment.</p>

<p>• Etiquette: I am not old-fashioned (or who knows, maybe I am), and I understand that morals and values change with times. However, I am seriously shocked by the number of people who seem to lack any basic manners, and much of this has to do with technology. I am surprised by the amount of people that take selfies while I talk to them (literally in the middle of a conversation), or literally decide to text while driving and kill other people (this is clearly beyond etiquette). The point is, though, our standards for social interaction have been lowered because, well, maybe social interaction will become obsolete:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/3025299/how-infinite-information-will-warp-and-change-human-relationships">https://www.fastcompany.com/3025299/how-infinite-information-will-warp-and-change-human-relationships</a></p>

<p>I recently went on vacation, and I genuinely always loved traveling on planes because I always meet somebody new and interesting. For the first time, however, I was taken aback. When I walked through the airport, there were tablets everywhere, and nobody was talking. On the plane, people were completely absorbed in the movies and music they were watching on the built-in screens. I remember all of the people I had talked to before, maybe out of sheer boredom, but for once, I had not spoken to a person all day, accept the elderly lady who could not work the tablet in the restaurant.</p>

<p>By the way, do the black &quot;mirrors&quot; of our screens remind anyone of scrying?</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrying">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrying</a></p>

<p>• Love Knows No Boundaries Campaign: There is definitely propaganda to accept any and all immigration, and despite whatever you believe in politically, you are considered a bigot if you think, maybe, just maybe, we should have standards for who enters the United States (or whatever country you live in). There is certainly much to be said about the mass immigration of Europe, and while there will be conflicting views, I believe that much of it has been devastating for European countries:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.express.co.uk/comment/columnists/leo-mckinstry/607561/Brussels-death-throes-Mass-immigration-destroy-European-Union">http://www.express.co.uk/comment/columnists/leo-mckinstry/607561/Brussels-death-throes-Mass-immigration-destroy-European-Union</a></p>

<p>Ultimately, is this not just setting up for the new world order? This will be a one world government, where the standards are controlled by the government itself. God will not need to exist because the government will have the standards set in place perfectly. </p>

<p>“One believes things because one has been conditioned to believe them.” 
““...most men and women will grow up to love their servitude and will never dream of revolution.”
(Brave New World)</p>

<p><strong>The Paradox of Equality and Freedom</strong></p>

<p>As we feel that we are becoming more equal, loving, and “one”, we are essentially losing our freedom. We are being told what to think, how to live, and essentially, that we must accept everything without standards.</p>

<p>Is that really freedom? Has “the world state” become the replacement for God, spirituality, and religion, and even if you do not believe those things, then standards themselves? And at what cost?</p>

<p>Even if you do not believe in God, what have you replaced God with? Our government? Scientism? CNN? Trump? Feminism? Who are you allowing your life standards to be influenced by?</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>I am not sure how I ended up writing something this long, but if you read it, I sincerely thank you. Every day, I read posts, and I have so much to say, but sometimes I feel lost and hopeless, and I am not sure I have the energy to.</p>

<p>I know I bring up the fact that I am teacher a lot, but that is really all I am right now. I put my heart and soul into teaching, and yet, I cannot help but be shocked by the lack of standards that seem prominent in our society. If nothing else, I just want others to recognize that maybe, just maybe it was not always this way, and maybe, just maybe, this is not the best route.</p>

<p>A few months ago, a student asked me why I would be a teacher, when I could be a rich. I wish it was that I could respond that I have standards for myself, and in a way I did. The standard, I feel, for our society, should be that we think beyond ourselves – that we do not worship ourselves, but rather, we care for people, but we also are willing to critically analyze our society.</p>

<p>Ultimately, whatever you believe, there is no doubt in mind that everything is intentional. I mean, there are studies about how colors impact our thought processes. So, whatever is propagated in the media, I feel we must critically analyze. Why is the &#39;do what thou wilt&quot; mentality propagated so heavily, especially by celebrities?</p>

<p>Is it all just coincidence, or is there something more sinister here? Are we all moving toward &quot;one love&quot; or are we all being fooled?

    <div class="md"><p>Hi polkadotgirl,</p>

<p>Thanks for a great post! I visited this one because of your more recent post linking to this.</p>

<p>I believe that Crowley bastardised this to the point that love has been subjugated to the law - the law that puts the will above all else. Yet Augustine is telling people to love first, and once that is done - to act based upon that foundation. That is essentially the short form of what Jesus said:</p>

<p>&quot;Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength. The second is this: Love your neighbor as yourself. There is no commandment greater than these.&quot;</p>

<p>In the rest of the Bible, Jesus always preached the necessity of living what you believe - that is to not just say what you believe but to DO what you believe. Love, then do. How different this is to what Crowley said!</p>

<p>Crowley corrupts the message of Jesus by effectively saying: do what you will and love when it suits your will. What an evil twist! Love is now conditional. Love is not above all. Only the will is. Love is inherently something that is interpersonal and positive. But the will? The will, as well surmised by Nietzsche, only concerns itself with the exercise of power. In the end, Crowley is fostering a form of idealised ethical egoism. That is, ethics are only as useful in so far as they pertain to your self, your ego. It may as well be nihilism. Only a handful of people such as yourself are able to pursue this thought to its evil core and call it what it is - satanism. </p>

<p>I look forward to more quality content from you! Cheers!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How many people does Satan actually kill or hurt in the Bible?   And how many people does God kill or hurt?</p>

<p>What exactly does the Serpent (who is usually identified with Satan, even though there&#39;s zero evidence of that in the Bible) do?  He gives Adam and Eve information that God doesn&#39;t want them to have!  Indeed, the Serpent is the r/conspiracy of Genesis.  ;-)</p>

<p>If you actually read the Bible after Genesis, it is completely clear that Satan <em>works for God.</em>  None of this whole fallen angel/paradise lost narrative appears anywhere in the Bible at all.  Satan is used to test humans to see if they are truly loyal to God.</p>

<p>And of course, a Satan who can act against the wishes of God is completely incompatible with an omnipotent, omniscient God.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Let me be brutally frank here.  Neither &quot;Satan&quot; nor &quot;God&quot; exist at all, at least as they are depicted in the Bronze Age document called the Bible.  These are primitive superstitions of primitive people.  These ideas have persisted to the modern day because people are very understandably frightened of death and oblivion and the unknown, and because the 1% finds them very convenient for keeping people in line.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We live in a world where the system is run by a hierarchical authority structure. </p>

<p>That, by itself, isn&#39;t such a big deal. The problem comes from the kind of people who usually rise to the top of the authority structure. I believe that human nature occurs as a broad spectrum of personality types/behaviors.</p>

<p>On average, people are just ok. Generally a bit selfish and manipulative, but also capable of great cooperation. The people who &quot;run the system&quot; represent perhaps the most aggressive, most selfish and greediest 1% of humanity.</p>

<p>Since this the kind of people who run things, society tends to reflect their attitudes and values.</p>

<p>So if the world is becoming a twisted and unnatural version of itself, it&#39;s partly because the world is run by twisted and unnatural people.</p>

<p>Maybe this process will continue to worsen until there&#39;s some sort of collapse. The whole centralized, hierarchical authority structure breaks down, the meek inherit the Earth... and we get a fresh start.</p>

<p>Less suitable than what? Less suitable than the Horror in late 18th century France when guillotines were running at capacity and public executions were considered a form of entertainment?</p>

<p>Less suitable than the mustard gas trenches of WWI combat?</p>

<p>Less suitable than the end of the Three Kingdoms War in late 2nd century China when somewhere between 60 and 80% of the population (tens of millions!) died in combat or ensuing famine and disease?</p>

<p>:-o</p>

<p>The whole idea of &quot;personal responsibility&quot; is an extremely modern one.   Before the Reformation and the Renaissance, these ideas basically didn&#39;t exist at all.</p>

<p>Do note that Christianity has only the weakest idea of &quot;personal responsibility&quot;.  There is no action so terrible that you cannot be saved by a personal relationship with Jesus.  Conversely, because &quot;we are all sinners&quot;, no positive action that you do has the slightest value without a personal relationship to God.</p>

<p>Christianity is all about personal responsibility. The 10 commandments are basically written in stone :).</p>

<p>May I go on a little tangent here? The kid in Canada that is going to be raised gender-neutral... What happens if a parent decides to raise their child as the complete opposite gender?

    <div class="md"><p>Great post OP. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The philosophy of “Do what thou wilt” is prominent in our world right now, and I feel that it is ultimately harming everybody.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think it all comes down to balance. People need balance to thrive, too much of anything is a bad thing. </p>

<p>Right now theres a message of unrestricted hedonism being pushed extremely hard. The idea seems to be that you should engage in as many hedonic activities as possible and the quantity and quality thereof will determine your social worth. Very few of these activities are inherently problematic, instead it&#39;s the unhealthy focus on them that is detrimental. The reason that the focus becomes unhealthy is because people, in general, suck at moderating themselves and quickly get hooked into self destructive cycles. </p>

<p>Basically, if you tell a person &#39;do what thou wilt&#39; with no limitations many will do whatever feels good and take it to the extreme. In the abscence of a message of moderation or balance, this will end up with self destructive behaviours. Just like anything else, the easier it is to have something, the less satisfying it is to have. So you seek the next buzz, and then the next one, ad infinitum. This ends badly. </p>

<p>But why does such a hedonic spiral end badly?</p>

<p>It ends badly because it doesn&#39;t come with any <em>meaning</em>. Purpose and meaning are two very important things for humans (see the arguments of Viktor Frankl for more on that). Whether we like it or not, we seek purpose and meaning. Mindless hedonism cannot fill that void, but more importantly: <em>Our current media pushes absolutely nothing but mindless hedonism</em>. So when people finally want to get off that ride, they have nothing to turn too. </p>

<p>There is no balance, no mediation. At least, not formally. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I find it interesting that many atheists seem to revere the Church of Satan, stating that it is simply just “anti-theism” in order to promote progress and intellectualism in our society.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m personally agnostic, I tend towards hard determinism, so religion really isn&#39;t my thing. </p>

<p>AFAIK most of those who really like CoS are literally just trolling, they don&#39;t actually care. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Abortions are cool now: I know that we all have our own moral beliefs about abortions, and honestly, I am morally against them but not necessarily legally. Whatever your view though, isn’t it strange how having an abortion is directly tied to female empowerment? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah, I find it very strange, though to be fair I&#39;m notoriously &#39;anti-life&#39; (generally pro aborition, capital punishment, euthanasia etc). Yet, all of the women I&#39;ve ever discussed abortion with, even the ones who have had abortions, find the new narrative of abortion == womens rights to be disturbing. Speak to anyone whose had an abortion about how &#39;empowering&#39; their experience was and you&#39;d be lucky if they didn&#39;t try to castrate you on the spot. </p>

<p>Which of course naturally leads to the question of where the message is coming from?</p>

<p>I have no idea. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is important to note that I do not personally care what people identify with, but when something is propagated by the media continually, we have to ask ourselves why. On top of that, even if we feel it is not harming anybody, we are now letting children to make choices before they even can understand the complexities of sex, gender, biology, etc. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s the problem though isn&#39;t it? we <em>say</em> we are doing it because everyone is &#39;free to be themselves&#39; etc. Except that we aren&#39;t actually bothering to ensure the informed consent of those involved. It&#39;s a feel good message, not a rational one. More to the point is that it&#39;s explicitly political. The research that would need to be done to be sure we aren&#39;t reaching into &#39;frontal labotomy 2.0&#39; territory has not been done. The science ain&#39;t happening right now. Why? because its not politically acceptable to do right now. </p>

<p>That&#39;s is disturbing. We put facts on hold, push through heavily invasive life changing proceedures and them claim it all in the name of science. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The conspiracy here is a breakdown of our identities, our gender roles, our family structures, our society, and our standards. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which I think is the end goal. </p>

<p>If you want control of a society, then divide and conquer works well. </p>

<p>But the problem has been that, traditionally, cultures are fairly monolithic, people hold roughly the same views etc. If you want to really control, you need to break the cultures themselves. To fracture them into a thousand different minorities. Without a monolithic culture to draw upon, you can make them all fight amongst themselves while you reign supreme. </p>

<p>So you breakdown the family units. Where once entire extended families worked together, it then became just mum,dad and the kids. Now it&#39;s just mum <em>or</em> dad and the kids <em>sometimes</em>. The same pattern follows with morality, social standards, behaviour, beliefs. Take it, fracture it and weaken the whole. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Health – It is not secret that many succumb to gluttony.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which is probably due to rampant existential distress we see. Eating feels good, gotta fill the void. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Education – This one is a tricky subject, and while many more are going to college, I feel that most are not learning, but really being indoctrinated. Reading is no longer a pastime, and in my opinion, people are losing critical thinking skills. I know this is the huffington post, but there are many forms of research about an overall decline in intelligence:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m a postgrad student. From discussions with professors theres been a pattern of standards being dropped further and further over time. It&#39;s a fairly dire situation. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Etiquette: I am not old-fashioned (or who knows, maybe I am), and I understand that morals and values change with times. However, I am seriously shocked by the number of people who seem to lack any basic manners, and much of this has to do with technology. I am surprised by the amount of people that take selfies while I talk to them (literally in the middle of a conversation), or literally decide to text while driving and kill other people (this is clearly beyond etiquette). The point is, though, our standards for social interaction have been lowered because, well, maybe social interaction will become obsolete</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The hedonistic ideology invariably forces narcissism to become ingrained in people. The result seems to be complete lack of self awareness and disregard for their surroundings. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Love Knows No Boundaries Campaign: There is definitely propaganda to accept any and all immigration, and despite whatever you believe in politically, you are considered a bigot if you think, maybe, just maybe, we should have standards for who enters the United States (or whatever country you live in). There is certainly much to be said about the mass immigration of Europe, and while there will be conflicting views, I believe that much of it has been devastating for European countries</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Unchecked immigration is a ticking time bomb. As I mentioned before, the goal is to break cultures and render people down in fractured, isolated and easily manipulated small groups. Mass immigration is one way of reducing the scope of the dominant culture. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Is that really freedom? Has “the world state” become the replacement for God, spirituality, and religion, and even if you do not believe those things, then standards themselves? And at what cost?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m a full blown determinist, but I also don&#39;t really engage in moral relativism. To me, there is an objective right and wrong. We can make tradeoffs between things, to sometimes justify lesser evils, but the notion that there is no right and wrong is foreign to me. To me there is a single frame of reference from which these things can be determined. </p>

<p>The cost of losing that frame of reference is pretty severe. It doesn&#39;t require religion to maintain, but it does require some actual effort to replace, which I&#39;m not seeing in todays society. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Even if you do not believe in God, what have you replaced God with?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can hold objective ideals as paramount to the success of a society, without attributing those ideals to a god. Many ideals are pretty obvious is you just ask the right questions. Why be monogamous? male and females are born 50:50, monogamy ensures that the number of single, angry males is kept to a minimum. Single angry males start wars. Seems pretty obvious right? The same is true of most ideals really. </p>

<p>The problem is that you need to seriously think through what those ideals are, which typically is avoided. Personally I don&#39;t watch TV, I don&#39;t follow celebrities or engage in social media (besides arguing on reddit). I go to my lab, do my research. I go home and care for my partner and our friends and I make sure that my behaviours match my beliefs. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The standard, I feel, for our society, should be that we think beyond ourselves – that we do not worship ourselves, but rather, we care for people, but we also are willing to critically analyze our society.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because you feel a drive towards social responsibility. </p>

<p>The hedonic message doesn&#39;t preach social responsibility, instead it argues that responsibility is negative because it brings about suffering. Anything that doesn&#39;t always feel good, must be avoided at all times. In a suffering-adverse society, responsibility is something to be avoided. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why is the &#39;do what thou wilt&quot; mentality propagated so heavily, especially by celebrities?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They have all the resources they could wish for, so all thats left is mindless indulgence. That&#39;s problematic if society views your excesses as undesireable and limits their own ability to keep their resources. So they push for it. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Is it all just coincidence, or is there something more sinister here? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is something more sinister going on. Hedonism is being pushed far, far too hard. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for this post as I&#39;ve actually wanted to put this all into a coherent narrative which I haven&#39;t had the time or energy to do. </p>

<p>Since I was a young child I have questioned everything that has happened around me. There was a point where I questioned Christianity so much that I eventually claimed agnostic atheism but it never felt &quot;right&quot; because I didn&#39;t know what I felt at the time and had no guidance. </p>

<p>My distaste for this society has been a long-standing battle I&#39;ve fought since my days on MySpace. Every major ideology that has been pushed I have questioned and felt that we have been pushed towards narcissism. It was to the point that I was questioning every action I did because I felt I was being narcissistic - that&#39;s how much I don&#39;t like the idea of self-indulgence. </p>

<p>Recently, I&#39;ve been reading about Crowley and the Occult and the Age of Aquarius/Age of Horus and I felt that finally every itch, every question mark that I&#39;ve had about society has finally been answered. Every &quot;conspiracy&quot; that I&#39;ve kept to myself as a child, the critical thinking and deconstruction of the ideas of people around me, the constant questioning of the state of things... have all pointed me to this and I finally see that I had to question even my own religion full circle before I came back to this. </p>

<p>After doing as much reading as I have done - the combined concepts of philosophy, psychology, anthropology, sociology, biochemistry, religion, eastern philosophy, quantum physics and my general distaste of modern education - I now am completely awake and I am back on the path that I strayed from due to ignorance and my own stubborn, anti-authoritative nature. </p>

<p>Something that always bothered me, even when I claimed to be Atheist, was that it was always as if God and science were &quot;opposites&quot; yet I never saw it that way. People were trying to answer metaphysical questions with physical tools and that made no sense to me. So when someone so adamantly claimed that science disproved God, it never sat right with me. </p>

<p>Now, my &quot;belief&quot; in the duality of nature and mankind has lead me to see that if there is this much concentrated &quot;evil&quot; or &quot;negative energy&quot; that exists, there is a counterbalance and it exists somewhere even or despite or acknowledgment of it. </p>

<p>Why is it that if you are religious you are immediately seen as being less intelligent? Why is Atheism now the more &quot;rational&quot; thing to believe in?</p>

<p>At this point, I believe intelligence is also an illusion - an idea that is shoved down our throats to perpetuate the ego and satisfying the ego seems to precisely what our society likes to do. Ego is our downfall. Technology will keep us unempathetic and lacking basic compassion. The failing education system will further eliminate critical thinking. Modern machines will replace all of our mental capacities. The food industry will continue to poison us. The acceptance movement and &quot;PC culture&quot; will further remove self-accountability. All of this cannot be denied whether or not you believe in something higher. </p>

<p>Similar to yourself, I am also in education and I have never seen students so dependent and impatient. Modern education is a joke. My students are so calculator dependent and so quick to look for an &quot;answer&quot; they don&#39;t take the time to think about anything at all anymore. True education was done away with years ago, if not decades. The only thing I can do now as an educator - and as a mathematician - is hope to further critical thought and analysis: the same tool that helped me question what was going on around me. That is the beauty of mathematics... that ability to critically think and train your brain to question everything. That is invaluable and will be lost eventually.</p>

<p>I&#39;m rambling now but all in all I want to say thank you. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You make a number of valid points, but I&#39;d like to clarify a few key points for you, if I may. To begin, the so-called law of Thelema, comprised of the mantra and directive: &quot;Do what thou wilt is the whole of law&quot; was first used by Crowley and his adherents in the O.T.O. and A.A. in the early 1900s, near the turn of the century if I recall correctly.</p>

<p>This was basically another example of Crowley plagiarizing the work of others, while subsequently adding another layer of meaning and symbolism to these words, as he would often do. The phrase was first coined by Francois Rebelais in his (at the time) controversial and satirical 16th century work &#39;Gargantua and Pantagruel&#39; not coincidentally itself containing an &#39;Abbey of Theleme&#39; as a literary device and metaphor for rebellion against the theocratic hierarchy. I suspect there was more to Rebelais than meets the eye, possibly if not likely an initiate of one of the esoteric or &#39;hidden&#39; secret societies of his age. Fast forward a few centuries and we see the phrase re-emerge as the motto of the Hellfire Club, founded by Sir Francis Dashwood, located in a network of caves and chambers situated beneath a chapel in the English hillsides, wherein the attendees would engage in all manner of drunken debauchery, and allegedly orgies and occult rituals and possibly even ritual sacrifices (though this remains more a matter of hearsay and innuendo, e.g. it is possible but not confirmed). This (the Hellfire Club&#39;s) usage may have &#39;inspired&#39; Crowley in one way or another, or not. We can&#39;t say for certain, but we can say for certain he was at minimum familiar with the work of Rebalais, to the extent he would proclaim the man a &#39;Gnostic Saint&#39; in his ECG (Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica) or &#39;Gnostic Catholic Church&#39; (the word &#39;Catholic&#39; used here liberally and metaphorically), being the ecclesiastic arm of the OTO (Ordo Templi Orientis), best known for its public demonstrations of the &#39;Gnostic Mass&#39;.</p>

<p>Now to properly understand the true meaning of the law of Thelema, &#39;Do what thou wilt&#39; one must first look to the definition of Thelema itself, a classical Greek phrase referring to one&#39;s &#39;will&#39; among other things. Now this is key, as to what the concept of one&#39;s &#39;Will&#39; represents in Thelema. In this context, it refers to one&#39;s true and ultimate purpose in life and beyond, the will of one&#39;s soul or higher self if you will, to be discovered and clarified through an ongoing process of meditation, ritual and attainment (of enlightenment, gnosis, the Great Work, or illumination).</p>

<p>To put it simply, the point of the law of Thelema, &#39;Do what thou wilt&#39; is to find your higher calling or purpose in life and strive to (above all) make it a reality. It does not mean to &#39;do what you want&#39; in hedonistic fashion with complete disregard for others or morality, though many can and have interpreted it as such, both supporters and more often critics of Thelema. That said, morality and societal norms are generally disregarded or considered secondary (at best) to one&#39;s &#39;True Will&#39; in Thelema, which can certainly have negative repercussions depending on how one chooses to interpret this in their own personal capacity. </p>

<p>I have a mantra of my own I often adhere to, one of them anyway, an amended version of this &#39;law&#39; of Thelema containing a portion of the hippocratic oath, that is to say: &#39;Do what thou wilt and do no harm&#39;. Having a reasonable understanding of Thelema, while not adhering to it or any other particular current or religion, I choose to instead incorporate the positive elements of it (among others) into my own personal philosophy, one I adhere to willingly: to find my own true purpose or higher calling in life or destiny, and to eventually make it a reality, with the sole stipulation that I refrain from knowingly or willingly harming others in the process, or interfering with their &#39;True Will&#39; or fate or civil liberties (depending on how you choose to view or quantify it).</p>

<p>I hope this makes things clearer, for you and others here reading this post. I am not attempting to defend Crowley, necessarily, or the &#39;law&#39; of Thelema as it stands, rather clarifying the meaning behind it. Crowley was, needless to say, a deeply flawed and complicated individual, and the more you read of his own work the more you come to realize he was, while ever the egoist, not nearly as &#39;evil&#39; as others or even himself claimed he were. Perhaps, but to a degree, and realistically less so than many of the world leaders and war criminals of today, and while much if not all of his writing should be taken with a grain of salt and approached cautiously, objectively some of his philosophies (keyword: some) are entirely reasonable, others not so much. For example, in Liber AL vel Legis (the Book of the Law), there are a number of passages one can find uplifting, positive and inspirational (i.e. &#39;Every man and woman is a star&#39;) while certain other, slightly darker elements may not be for everyone, not me at least. This is why it&#39;s better to form your own conclusions and opinions on such matters, as with politics or religion, rather than simply adhering to or parroting the beliefs and opinions of others, and why I have as much tolerance and respect for Thelemites as I do for Christians, Jews, Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists, atheists, agnostics, etc, so long as they do not resort to harming others in the name of their religion or belief system.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, to me religion is not about believing in an invisible man living in the sky who will solve all your money and health problems if you pray hard enough.</p>

<p>It&#39;s about having some spiritual guidance, because even when we become adults, most of us still need &quot;someone&quot; to guide us in life. It&#39;s about meeting regularly with other people you share the same virtuous values with. It doesn&#39;t matter whether you call that religion Christian, Muslim or Buddhist. They all teach to respect others, love rather than hate, don&#39;t cheat/lie/deceit others etc... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>While I don&#39;t agree with everything you say, this is a really thoughtful and well-written piece.  Bravo!</p>

<p>Some points:</p>

<h2></h2>

<p>First, Crowley had a foot in both the right-hand (good guys) and left-hand (bad guys) path.  However, &quot;Do what thou wilt&quot; has been very much misinterpreted.  Crowley himself clarified it:  &quot;&#39;Do what thou wilt&#39; does not mean &#39;Do as you please&#39;!&quot;</p>

<p>Instead, what &quot;Do what thou wilt&quot; means is that you are supposed to clarify and empower your &quot;Magickal Will&quot;, and then follow that as a guide.  It isn&#39;t about freedom to follow whims but rather disciplining and focusing your desires in a specific manner.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t want to beat this part to death.  Crowley was definitely not a nice guy, and had a lot of not-very-nice ideas.  However, the idea of &quot;Do what thou wilt&quot; is not a bad one.</p>

<h2></h2>

<p>The endless obsession that both the left and the right have about non-binary genders (&quot;teh gay&quot;) baffles me.  Who cares?  I mean, really, who cares?  I&#39;m a straight guy, very boring, why do I care if some other guy has sex with men, or blowup dolls, or whatever?  </p>

<p>Of course, sex with children, animals or other non-consensual sex is an evil crime - but this has nothing to do with non-binary genders.  The vast majority of pederasts are &quot;straight&quot; exactly because the vast majority of <em>people</em> are straight.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homosexual_behavior_in_animals">Lots of animal species</a> have homosexual sex.  Lots of cultures, particularly outside of the West, have more than two genders.  A small but not tiny number of humans are born with both genitalia - I know such a person myself, and if you met them, you would honestly think nothing of it.</p>

<p>It&#39;s very clear now that homosexuality and other non-binary genders are mostly inborn - that most gay people don&#39;t &quot;choose&quot; to be gay - but so what if they did?  Who cares what other people do for fun? </p>

<p>Considering that one of the greatest issues affecting everyone is an exponentially increasing population on a finite planet, we should be thankful that people voluntarily decide not to procreate!</p>

<h2></h2>

<p>If you read a lot of history, you should be struck by how much <em>better</em> people treat each other today than at any time in the past.  The idea that things are getting more and more evil simply doesn&#39;t wash.  Sure, there are always psychopaths, and due to the media we hear a lot about them, but consider that Genghis Khan forces killed about 10% of the world&#39;s population at the time, and they were killed one at a time - no bombs or gas chambers.  If you read about the terrible tortures that were considered normal in  the classical world, you get a good idea of how much we have improved.</p>

<p>We have longer life expectancies, we are healthier through out them, we have fewer wars, fewer murders, many fewer plagues, we can respond to disasters quickly and effectively.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong - I don&#39;t see the future as rosy at all.  Indeed, I think we&#39;re due for a collapse - simply because of the issue of &quot;exponentially increasing population/finite Earth&quot;.  Between climate change, resource exhaustion, the massive die off of non-human species, and the fouling of the ecosystem, I expect that some of the people reading this will experience a collapse period, where some large fraction of the world&#39;s humans die long before their natural life expectancy.</p>

<p>It will be terrible indeed - but it won&#39;t be because of the &quot;forces of evil&quot;.  Sure, there are plenty of evil leaders in place, but the collapse will occur because of simple human laziness and the inability to see logical consequences of our poor decisions.</p>

<hr/>

<p>And yes, the Black Mirror phenomenon is very real, and touches all of this.  But you know, I&#39;m a very gregarious guy - and yet, do I want to make small talk with some random guy sitting beside me in an airplane for seven hours?  More, it&#39;s likely that <em>they</em> realistically don&#39;t want to hear <em>my</em> weird ideas for very long!</p>

<p>I used to do a lot of plane travel (I eventually left the US entirely so now I do very little) and let me tell you, having screens to watch movies at each seat made the difference between, &quot;Hours of increasingly intolerable boredom&quot; and not.  I love to read - I have tens of thousands of books, and I used to show up to the airport with a dozen books - but after three or four hours in a plane, my ability to concentrate is shot.</p>

<hr/>

<p>The real issue is the impending collapse.  I think all of these other issues are smokescreens.  </p>

<p>I think they emerged naturally - as a straight person, the first time you see two people of the same sex kissing, you feel weird and squiffy, though you get over it pretty fast with a little work - but they have been used by the 1% to inflame the rest of us, to distract us, and prevent us from taking action on the collapse - because said action would involve a huge amount of resources, and considering how 8 people own as much as the bottom <em>half</em> of humanity put together, it seems likely that most of those resources would have to come from the 1%.</p>

<p>Looking at history, the story of the world has been the rich and powerful taking advantage of the rest of us.  We, the rest of us, have done particularly well in the last century, but the rich and powerful continue to be trying to take advantage of us right to the end.  There is no need to postulate secret conspiracies, though of course some of these do exist - most of the problems are right there in front of our faces.</p>

<p>If you were to suddenly wake up a hundred years from now, I guarantee you that no future large-scale history would talk about a worldwide conspiracy of pederasts <em>even if this turned out to be true</em> (which is certainly possible).  </p>

<p>Instead, they will say, &quot;Humanity over-reproduced and over-consumed its resources, leading up to a huge collapse in human population, and terrible suffering.  The world&#39;s leaders, both politicians and rich people, were to blame, as they steered the ship right over the waterfall while knowing it was there.&quot;</p>

<p>Thanks again for a thought-provoking piece of writing.  Keep up the good work.</p>

<p>---But that <em>is</em> the conspiracy. To me they are breaking down traditional gender roles which curbs population growth. It also leads to a genderless, where they can be more in control of who gives birth through the system. The world state will be in charge of everyone. Let&#39;s not forget that they ultimately want to get people used to the concept of transhumanism. Also I feel it is some type of worship of baphomet and the complete twisting of man and woman.</p>

<p>Family structures are there (or used to be there) to perpetuate standards so that people can live <em>virtuous</em> lives.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think one of the biggest failures of the 60s is the evisceration of virtues. Now virtue has become personal. Now we have no right to impose our virtues on others. Virtues which used to be culturally sanctioned have been hollowed out and are now relegated to the dustbins of history under the banner of &quot;smash the patriarchy&quot;. We have stopped valuing them. We are now to merely be good and not virtuous. The is especially apparent in postmodern secularism in which people have no solid ground on which to build there moral ethics. Morality is relative.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Without virtues and solid moral ground on which to base them on (like Christianity) what we get is ever creeping nihilism and moral relativism. Who determines what is morally right and what is morally repugnant? </p>

<p>Emptiness and hip cynicism is now the default setting in many places. We have lost something human without our moral grounding. The problem is that most people don&#39;t have the incentive or inclination to have a well thought our moral system.  Earlier it was the duty of God and larger society. Nothing has replaced them and when push come to shove people don&#39;t usually behave morally or stay true to whatever belief they unconsciously cling to. The only sensible way to live in this world is without rules. (There is a great line in The Dark Knight about this &quot;See, their [the people of Gotham’s] morals, their “code”… it’s a bad joke, dropped at the first sign of trouble. They’re only as good as the world allows them to be. I’ll show you. When the chips are down, these, uh, these “civilized people,” they’ll eat each other. See, I’m not a monster. I’m just ahead of the curve… The only sensible way to live in this world is without rules.&quot;  The last line is a great indictment of the hip nihilists and anarchists.) </p>

<p>Without a firm moral grounding our society is being hollowed out. There is a great crisis of faith among the people concerning the institutions which we have built. Man needs an ideal higher than himself to believe in. To tie his identity around. </p>

<p>Now that we have lost faith in God we desperately cling to ideologies to give meaning to our lives, to make it seem less empty and futile. This is why you see people believing their own ideologies so fiercely. The &quot;enlightened&quot; materialists and &quot;progressives&quot; believe in the idea of progress as an end unto itself. But progress and technology won&#39;t save us. It won&#39;t satisfy our soul. It will never redeem us of our faults. Without God we just worship other things.  For worship we must. </p>

<p>&quot;to day trenches of adult life, there is actually no such thing as atheism. There is no such thing as not worshipping. Everybody worships. The only choice we get is what to worship. And the compelling reason for maybe choosing some sort of god or spiritual-type thing to worship—be it JC or Krishna, be it YHWH or the Wiccan Mother Goddess, or the Four Noble Truths, or some inviolable set of ethical principles—is that pretty much anything else you worship will eat you alive. If you worship money and things, if they are where you tap real meaning in life, then you will never have enough, never feel you have enough. It&#39;s the truth. Worship your body and beauty and sexual allure and you will always feel ugly. And when time and age start showing, you will die a million deaths before they finally grieve you. On one level, we all know this stuff already. It&#39;s been codified as myths, proverbs, clichés, epigrams, parables; the skeleton of every great story. The whole trick is keeping the truth up front in daily consciousness&quot;_David Foster Wallace. </p>

<p>What is the solution? I honestly have no idea. People have to make a conscious choice to have well thought out moral opinions. And society should elevate classically virtues once again in the cultural milieu. How I do not know. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure, Crowley had an interest in the darker side of the occult and definitely did some rather questionable things, but I refuse to believe all this sensationalised bullshit about him being some kind of paragon of evil. </p>

<p>Seems to me that TPTB don&#39;t want people to know the truth about Crowley and his knowledge of the occult, they don&#39;t want you to read his books or use his tarot deck because they contain far too much truth. </p>

<p>Occult does not mean bad or evil, it simply means hidden knowledge, and they have been able to keep much of Crowley&#39;s knowledge hidden by portraying him as the most evil man that ever lived. </p>

<p>However, the man&#39;s mind was a treasure trove of information. Information that has been purposely hidden from the human race.   He was an expert in his field and there is merit in his words. There&#39;s been what I feel is, an obvious smear campaign to turn people away from the truth he spoke. The elite <strong>know</strong> what he knew, and the vast majority of the human population don&#39;t.... there is a reason for that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well it seems that we agree that society has cancer. We see the same symptoms but posit different causes.</p>

<p>I would argue that seeking standards for human morality from a god is orders of magnitude more ridiculous than seeking out Stephen Hawking to explain long division.</p>

<p>Next it would probably be more beneficial to society to dismiss what Crowley said in favor of the more widely accepted &quot;Golden Rule,&quot; basically, don&#39;t do what you wouldn&#39;t want done to you or yours (the logic in this is self-evident if you accept the premise that we are one).</p>

<p>As for the obseity point, I think that you might be blaming the wrong deadly sin. My spidey senses tell me that in many cases, pride and greed are more likely to be the culprits than gluttony. Pride on the part of the eater, who fails to seek out knowledge of nutrition, and greed on the part of the producers of products that make people fat while starving them at the same time.</p>

<p>As for selfishness, blaming Satanism seems to be a sub-optimal way to address it. The self righteous might cheer you one, but you will alienate more than you convince, and even your supporters will probably need a refresher on the moral of the mote and the beam. </p>

<p>Ego is an illusion, but that illusion is constantly reinforced in today&#39;s society. When an illusion is reinforced and accepted, it becomes a reality, and in a reality where the &quot;self&quot; is real, selfishness will follow.</p>

<p>If you would destroy selfishness, you would need to destroy the self, and the only &quot;self&quot; that you have direct control over is yours.</p>

<p>You can neither force nor prevent the growth of others.</p>

<p>&quot;Be the change that you want to see in the world.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Awesome post, OP.<br/>
You deserve gold.<br/>
IMO,  I would swap out &#39;god&#39; with YHWH.</p>

<p>When you state, &quot;A Hypothetical God Would Have Standards&quot;, YHWH actually has standards/instructions and it&#39;s called the Torah.  The Torah is the instructions that he gave to Moses and his people to follow.  This is something that Talmudic Jews have replaced with their man-made rules, &#39;The Talmud&#39; and the Christians assume that Yahushua (what the world calls Jesus) came to destroy. (Son destroys his dad&#39;s &#39;forever&#39; instructions and rules!??!?!)<br/>
In Deuteronomy 4:2 YHWH said:Do not add (what Jews have done with their hundreds of laws in the Talmud) to or subtract (what Christians have done with &quot;Jesus came to destroy the law&quot;) from these commands I am giving you. Just obey the commands of [YHWH your Elohim] that I am giving you.</p>

<p>The way I like to picture the Mighty One is that he is an all spiritual player of his version of &#39;The Sims&#39;.  He looks down on his monitor (firmament) and allows his sims to multiply and have &#39;free will&#39;. Certain sims have direct control/communication from the Almighty One and some don&#39;t. (If you&#39;ve played the Sims, you know what I mean, if you tried to make every single one of each Sims&#39; decision, the game would take forever and get boring real quick without the autopilot/freewill running) The Almighty chooses a Sim he really likes and favors it and it&#39;s offspring over all the other Sims because of his faith towards the Almighty One. Certain Sims start to &quot;hack&quot; the game and they start to be evil continually. (Wouldn&#39;t you want to start a new game if all the Sims just didn&#39;t do what you wanted them to do in the game?) Certain Sims start to &#39;think&#39; they have figured &quot;life&quot; out and think that they are their own creators. We can go on and on but anyways, The Almighty is beyond the scope of the &quot;sims world&quot;/Earth he created and creates a son (version of a Sim after himself) who is half Elohim (self appointed title that YHWH gave himself) and half human to teach about how the Almighty One wants them to live life (by following Torah, not man-made laws and traditions.  </p>

<p>So when you break down what the Bible says, there are really only two types of people: those that follow the Torah, the Almighty&#39;s laws or Satan&#39;s law: Do what thou wilt.  You cannot follow both sets of laws.
Some of the Jews place the Talmud ahead of the Torah which cancel each other out and they&#39;re now in the &quot;Do what thou wilt&quot; group.  Christians remove the Torah completely and think all you have to do is believe in Jesus which places them in the &quot;Do what thou wilt&quot; group.<br/>
If people loved their neighbors as themselves and I do mean honestly as themselves, we would not be in the mess we&#39;re in today.<br/>
PS - There are chariot wheels in the Red Sea, Noah&#39;s Ark has been found, the Ark of the Covenant is in the Garden Tomb with many dying trying to get to it, Sodom and Gomorrah is a real place that existed and can be visited today still containing brimstone. And a bunch of other stuff that you probably didn&#39;t even know that prove the events in the bible happened.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Really interesting post! I agree with yo for the most part...</p>

<p>But I was wondering your thoughts on the &quot;new covenant&quot;? To me Jesus did not &quot;destroy&quot; the old testament, but rather he came and explained what laws should be kept and what should not. Thoughts?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Fulfillment of the Law<br/>
Matthew 17 [Yahushua (Jesus) saying]<br/>
&quot;<strong>Do not</strong> think that I have come to abolish the Law[TORAH] or the Prophets; I <strong>have not</strong> come to <strong>abolish</strong> them[TORAH], but to <em>fulfill them</em>[TORAH]. 18 For I tell you truly, <em>until heaven and earth pass away</em>, <em>not a single jot, not a stroke of a pen, will disappear from the Law</em>[TORAH] <em>until everything is accomplished</em>. 19 So then, whoever breaks one of the least of these commandments and teaches others to do likewise will be called least in the kingdom of heaven, but whoever practices and teaches them will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.…&quot;  </p>

<p>Be careful with Christianity, they are &quot;Torah subtract-ers&quot;. They remove from the Torah (not following the Sabbath, not wearing tzizits, eating unclean animals when commanded not to, not following YHWH&#39;s own feasts, etc.). Has heaven and earth pass away yet? No, so the Torah is still in affect.</p>

<p>Be careful with Judaism, they are &quot;Torah add-ers&quot;. They add to the Torah for instance, there are over 30 rules probably more (adding to Torah) <em>just to keep the Sabbath</em>. You&#39;re supposed to not work and rest on the Sabbath nothing more or less. (it shouldn&#39;t be hard to literally not work and rest right?)</p>

<p>Yahushua/Yeshua (Jesus) was known to argue with the Pharisees calling them hypocrites for preaching Torah in public but secretly following their own traditions/rules. (You mentioned Jesus came and explained what laws [TORAH] should be kept and what should not[TALMUD]... this is what I mean)</p>

<p>The Torah was made to be simple: Yochanan Aleph (1st John) 5:3<br/>
For this is the love of Elohim, that we keep His commandments: and <em>His commandments are not grievous</em>.</p>

<p>A good way to see it is imagine being a parent, if you are not already one yourself. You <em>command</em> (oh no!!!... /s) your child that you love with all your heart, THOU SHALT LOOK BOTH WAYS BEFORE CROSSING A STREET (commandment). It&#39;s up to the child to follow the parent&#39;s instruction(TORAH/Law) or not. The child can always do whatever it wants (Do what thou wilt). Whether the child follows the parent&#39;s command or not doesn&#39;t mean the parent loves them any more or less. It&#39;s up to the child to look both ways or not. If the child does not look both ways, it could cross the street safely or it could be struck by a vehicle. You as the parent hope they look both ways as there&#39;s a way better chance of survival and for the child to make it home without dying. Again, the parent doesn&#39;t automatically &quot;damn the child to hell&quot; as soon as the child just runs out the street without looking both ways first.<br/>
So just like you would have commandments like:<br/>
Thou shalt come home and have dinner every night 
Thou shalt not kill your siblings<br/>
Thou shalt chill and relax every Friday night<br/>
Thou shalt love your parents with all your heart and soul<br/>
Thou shalt wear this family jersey so all know your a (family name) and many others.<br/>
You&#39;d probably find way more favor in a child of yours that follows as much of your advice (commandments/instructions/&quot;your Torah&quot;) than a child that misbehaves, does whatever it wants, hates you, etc.</p>
