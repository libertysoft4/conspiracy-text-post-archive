    <div class="md"><p>Well they said there aren&#39;t any mysteries concerning 9/11. That a group of terrorists did it. 
Someone also said they found the reason of &quot;lowering unemployment&quot; not plausible enough to consider it an inside job. 
That anyone who believes it to be a conspiracy should be in a mental hospital, lol. 
And that conspiracy theories aren&#39;t as followed or as popular in Europe as they are in the States. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m from the UK and I think Israel was behind the attack. You&#39;re right conspiracys arent popular in Europe and I have to hide my views or summarise the issue as &quot;it&#39;s fucked&quot; in order to avoid being criticised as a person. Given the ties between Israel and the USA and the fact the owner of the world trade centre was Israeli and took out terrorism insurance just weeks before 9/11i think it&#39;s more likely 9/11 was an international effort </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t have time to go on a rant. Most of us don&#39;t believe it was like 3000 members of government in on it planning the whole thing.</p>

<p>Most believe Israel, Saudi&#39;s and some members in the US who pledge no allegiance to this country at all.</p>

<p>Looking at the facts it is undeniable that it was all a huge conspiracy.</p>

<p>People can try to debunk whatever evidence they want. It seems like when firefighters and cops say they see molten steel or hear bombs going off the whole time..their testimony is ignored.</p>

<p>They pick what they want to go in the official report. That&#39;s it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My opinion is that Bush wasn&#39;t involved in the planning but participated in the cover up because if its just an act of terrorism we are absolute victims. If its internal then it threatens government trust and we would have not been so compliant in any invasion of other countrys. Volunteers for military services wouldn&#39;t have been near what it was.</p>

<p>Bush , I think was in the dark to a certain point. For purposes of plausible deniability and emotional content.</p>

<p>Cheney on the other hand was.  Along with others who are unknown (although some theorists have a great list of names and associates.  Silverstein knew or was warned. Saudia Arabia and some of Israels players were involved too. </p>

<p>Its funny, Silverstein gave the interview where he said Building 7 was &quot;pulled&quot;. Which makes complete sense since it was announced early on television and wasn&#39;t impacted by anything that would cause a &quot;free fall&quot;.  It makes me wonder how many more large skyscrapers are rigged to be pulled should something real happen. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>So does everybody here believe 9/11 was an inside job?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No. But being a conspiracy sub, most here do.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It surprises me some people believe in the official report.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The <strong>vast</strong> majority of people (including the scientific community) believe that the buildings came down due to planes piloted by terrorists hitting them. This really shouldn&#39;t surprise you at all.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What do you believe really happened, and why?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What I think happened:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>A bunch of terrorists orchestrated the attack and Bush &amp; Co took advantage of the situation and used it to support their own personal agendas</p></li>
<li><p>They orchestrated it because of our involvement in Saudi Arabia and our support of Israel.</p></li>
<li><p>I believe this because that&#39;s the reason Al-Qaeda gave</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Why I don&#39;t believe in &quot;controlled demolition&quot;:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I&#39;ve personally spoken to professors and graduate students at one of the top engineer schools in the US. None believe in a &quot;controlled demolition&quot;. I&#39;ve seen &quot;back-of-the-envelope&quot; calculations that show just how much damage the planes and fire caused and how much force the remaining structures had to support. The answers were clear: <em>way</em> more than they were designed to support.</p></li>
<li><p>Ignoring point 1, all other controlled demolitions include many incredibly loud and distinct explosions which are not heard with the WTC collapses. Look up and <em>listen</em> to controlled demolitions. They sound nothing like the WTC collapses.</p></li>
<li><p>If fires alone can&#39;t bring down steel structures, then why do builders/engineers coat exposed beams in fire retardant?</p></li>
<li><p>Why couldn&#39;t any of the various insurers and stakeholders prove an inside job? They lost billions and would have jumped at the chance to prove the &quot;official&quot; story wrong. Yet no one could/did.</p></li>
<li><p>If 9/11 was an inside job to invade Iraq, why didn&#39;t they claim that <em>any</em> of the hijackers were Iraqi? Why would they claim that the hijackers were from Saudi Arabia and other countries, then invade Iraq? Bush &amp; Co would have gotten complete support to invade Iraq if they had orchestrated 9/11 with hijackers from Iraq. No need to lie about WMDs.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>As a final note, peddling 9/11 conspiracy theories can be <em>extremely</em> lucrative. <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/organizations/261532493">Check out</a> how much money &quot;Architects &amp; Engineers for 9/11 Truth&quot; make. Over half-a-million dollars a year and they have like 1 full time employee.</p>
