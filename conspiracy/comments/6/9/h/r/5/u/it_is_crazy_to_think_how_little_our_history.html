    <div class="md"><p>I can give you some authors, only because most of these guys don&#39;t have one Magnus opus that encompasses everything. I&#39;d recommend rereading sentences and paragraphs over and over again until you feel you have a good understanding. Remember, there is no filler in these books - they&#39;re not trying to make a 200-page book 300 pages so they have a better chance of landing on a best-seller list.</p>

<p>Nikola Tesla - In my opinion one of, if not THE, smartest man in the last few hundred years. Had a better understanding of this planet than anyone else. Solutions to free energy, living with nature. I believe when he was in his 80&#39;s he was living a life that was spent experimenting over 20 hours a day on a diet of milk, honey, and some fruits. he said he only required 1-2 hours a sleep a night.  </p>

<p>The Greeks - Plato, Socrates, Aristotle, Pythareous - Supringly easier to understand. All there concepts are weighed with reason. Start with &#39;Allegory of the Cave&#39;.</p>

<p>Remember, Aristotle was specifically chosen to tutor Alexander the Great because of his intellect. Alexander later went on to rule most of this world. </p>

<p>Graham Hancock will give you a modern understanding of civilizations that is years ahead of mainstream history. </p>

<p>Francis Bacon - Recently started reading him myself. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No respect for history teachers. No offense. But even when I was in high school some time where this snowflake shit was just a fringe iceberg on the horizon, I recognized them unquestionably pushing the narrative of things with no imagination.</p>

<p>I liked my Civics teach in my senior  year. He made us recite in front of the class every amendment almost verbatim. If we did that, we passed his class. He was very constitutionally oriented and refrained from injecting his opinion or colored perspective in any case. He even made us sit in on a live court hearing for 3 class days.</p>

<p>We walked from the school to the courthouse.</p>

<p>He was very focused on making sure students had a strong grasp of their constitutional rights and the division and ideal function of the 3 branches of government.</p>

<p>He&#39;s one of 3 teachers I left school respecting in all my years (college included).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually, There were many teachers who taught specs of truth...but I am talking about the 90s. Now, they will immediately fire anyone who doesn&#39;t tow the mainstream line. It doesn&#39;t matter what profession. How can teachers teach real truth when their paychecks depend on them teaching the propaganda? I think they call this period the &quot;post truth&quot; area. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you&#39;re 16 then get the shit out of here, this place is not what you think it is. This is, by design, an even more controllable limited hangout than your school. At least you can look your schoolmates and teacher in the eye.</p>

<p>There is no truth to be found here nor is critical thought truly encouraged; not from me, nor these guys cheering you on, not from anyone. Go read philosophy, study math and science, and leave things like conspiracy theories until 10 years from now. Just go live for awhile and avoid social media like a plague. It is the ultimate advertising and propaganda avenue. We know <em>exactly</em> what everyone says and does on these sites, every word and click, and we put it to use to push narratives. Anyone telling you about how woke they are and how woke you are for agreeing with them is just someone encouraging you to be deluded with them, or someone selling you a pack of lies. Etc, etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There was this really crazy time in my life where I had to basically unlearn most of the things school taught me. It was called my 20&#39;s. There&#39;s a lot of pretty little lies we feed children, and now I realize it&#39;s to get them to sign up repeatedly for their own slavery. By the time you even begin to realize what&#39;s going on, you&#39;re an adult and locked in. You&#39;ve already made a lot of bad choices based on false or erroneous information. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>OP, if there&#39;s one thing I could tell my 16 year old self, it would be to read 1000 times more books.  Seriously.
