<p>U.S. Military Helps Create Hollywood Films on War and Warriors <a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/entertainment-july-dec06-hollywood_10-06/">http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/entertainment-july-dec06-hollywood_10-06/</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Pentagon’s partnership with Hollywood starts at this West Los Angeles office tower, where every branch of the military keeps a liaison office to the entertainment industry.</p>

<p>&quot;Our mission here is to get the Navy onto the big screen and the little screen every chance we get, with every production that wants to use us. I’ll be blatant about it: We’re trying to get the Navy out there.&quot;</p>

<p>And what do Hollywood studios want in return for giving the military screen time? &quot;Usually, it’s equipment. Usually, they’re looking for toys. For them, we’re a provider. We’re a supplier, like everybody else. And Hollywood, they want the real thing. If they can get the real thing, they want the real thing.</p>

<p>If you want the military&#39;s assistance, you have to give them five copies of your script. They review the script. They make changes to the script to make it conform to the kind of film that they want to see. Most Americans have no idea that the content of the films and TV shows that they&#39;re watching are being influenced by military censors, that the military or the government is telling filmmakers what to say and what not to say.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Another link: &quot;All these people that run studios - they go to Washington, they hang around with senators, they hang around with CIA directors, and everybody&#39;s on board.&quot; <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/nov/14/thriller-ridley-scott">https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/nov/14/thriller-ridley-scott</a></p>

<p>Operation Mockingbird, CIA Media Control Program. Footage of hearings from the 70s [3:12]: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDCfTIapds0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDCfTIapds0</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;America&#39;s Army&quot; represents the official U.S. Army game that competes with commercial offerings such as &quot;Modern Warfare 2&quot; by also featuring online multiplayer shootouts. The free-to-play game has become a more effective recruiting tool for the Army than all other Army advertisements combined, according to MIT researchers. </p>

<p>Killing in &quot;America&#39;s Army&quot; also represents a fairly clean affair compared with the bloodier kills of &quot;Modern Warfare 2.&quot; That allowed the game to earn a &quot;T for teen&quot; rating, as part of its recruitment tool value.</p>

<p>&quot;We wanted kids to be able to start playing at 13,&quot; Berry explained. &quot;If they haven&#39;t thought about the Army by the time they get to 17, it&#39;s probably not something they&#39;ll do.&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The only way you are getting that shot of a carrier in your movie as a producer is to hand the script over to the appropriate division of the military and accept their changes.</p>

<p>What the real story will be is how much of the black budget went towards funding these movies &quot;on spec&quot;.  That won&#39;t really come out until after we have the realization as a species of exactly how many employees the CIA has, and how many of their &quot;cover identities&quot; are in &quot;entertainment&quot;, &quot; education&quot;, &quot;science&quot;, and &quot;news&quot;.</p>

<p>When the CIA is forced to release the general number of employees, just remember that the front companies employ people as well and multiply their number by 10.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From a similar post I commented on yesterday:</p>

<p>&quot;I hope that there will be an official repository for all of this sort of information some day&quot;</p>

<p>Please see Jan Irving&#39;s &quot;Gnostic Media&quot;:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gnosticmedia.com/">http://www.gnosticmedia.com/</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.caesarsmessiah.com/">http://www.caesarsmessiah.com/</a></p>

<p>On Jan&#39;s website he has a software interface (which requires you d/l a small piece of software to use it properly) that acts like a web or &quot;brain&quot; (it&#39;s called The Brain) and displays the links between all these cretins, social planners, schemers and numpties.</p>

<p>I believe L. Ron Hubbard is on there.</p>

<p>You might also enjoy this ep. of the American Journal of Economics and Sociology:</p>

<p>Please PM for full pdfs of the articles within.</p>

<p>It&#39;s an episode devoted to academics, researchers and professional bloggers about the now clear and established links between intell. agencies esp. the CIA and DoD to Hollywood - a healthy little benign relationship that stretches back to WWI and continues to the current day via analysis of many contemporary blockbusters with mil. themes.</p>

<p>I would also recommend (as someone above already has) you read up on/view:</p>

<p>additionally:</p>

<p>•The Dutroux scandal</p>

<p>•The Presidio military preschool scandal and other related incidents</p>

<p>•The combined history of the catholic church in gen. but specifically their enormous historical involvement in perping and suppressing the evidence of their perping pedo activities on orphaned children in their care</p>

<p>•The number of cases world wide but esp. the UK, USA, Canada and historically prominent/important European countries where social services, govt. dept&#39;s/agencies/intell./spook, law enforcement have involvement in outright perping and enabling pedo activities for political blackmail and utilisation in ritual abuse scenarios</p>

<p>•The mind blowing series Jan Irving of Gnostic Media has been doing with Steve Outtrim on the dark, occult history of Silicon Valley, the 60s counter culture and Burning Man fest.</p>

You want the military&#39;s help with the movie? The real deal? Only on their terms so they can recruit folks with the source material. Top Gun was the most effective/best example the book gave.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh yeah. This has been going on for a while. The military often allows Hollywood to use equipment (ships, tanks, planes, etc.) and official logos in exchange for a good representation of the military branch involved. The Tom Clancy movies are well known for this and it&#39;s also how a terrible movie like <em>Battleship</em> got the budget to have what looks like a full Navy fleet. </p>

<p>Of course Hollywood is also full of lower budget anti-war movies, especially in the late 70s and 80s, so it balances out. So watch something like <em>Hamburger Hill</em> or <em>Born on the Fourth of July</em> and you&#39;ll notice that most of the larger vehicles look like stock footage and the majority of the action is men on the ground. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think the CIA has ever been directly involved in Hollywood. I honestly can&#39;t name a single non-Tom Clancy movie where they are portrayed in a good light. For instance, the <em>Bourne</em> series, the <em>Mission: Impossible</em> movies, and <em>Three Days of the Condor</em> all have the CIA as evil antagonists. </p>
