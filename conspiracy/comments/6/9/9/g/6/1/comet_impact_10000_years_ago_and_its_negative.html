        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So recently it has been discovered by looking at stone carvings at Gobekli Tepe that a comet hit the earth around 10,000 years and led to the rise of civilizations. Before this impact humans lived in perfect harmony with nature. There was a large population of mega fauna that provided humans with their main food source. If you look at the diet of these people, their main source of calories was from animal fat. A single mammoth has a large amount of fat and can feed around 50 people for over a month. The majority of calories came from fat, then protein, and a small amount of carbohydrates from wild plants. This kind of diet is known as a ketogenic diet. When fat and protein is the main source of food, the body will burn ketones for energy instead of glucose. People also went without food for days at a time. This intermittent fasting type of diet has been shown to have many benefits, the most important is the increase and regulation of human growth hormone. People were also getting plenty of sunlight and good quality exercise every day. </p>

<p>A ketogenic diet has been used to cure things like epilepsy, diabetes, and mental illnesses. Intermittent fasting diets greatly increase natural human growth hormone production, which is by far the most beneficial hormone. HGH is a miracle hormone that has by far the most health benefits compared to any other drug or hormone. Cardiovascular exercise also has immense health benefits and is extremely important to mental and physical health. Humans from the past also had a ton more sun exposure than modern humans. Sunlight is extremely important to human health.</p>

<p>Humans bodies evolved with a ketogenic intermittent fasting diet and plenty of exercise for hundreds of thousands of years. Carbohydrate based diets and lack of exercise are the main contributor to bad health and aging. Too many simple carbs and sugar causes numerous negative health effects, from diabetes to mental illnesses. Doctors even refer to Alzheimer&#39;s disease as &quot;type 3 diabetes&quot; because eating too many carbs/sugars is one of the main factors causing it. </p>

<p>Fungus is the other main contributor to diseases. Many scientists believe that fungus is the main contributor to cancer, and leukemia has even been cured in people by taking anti fungal drugs. 
Carbohydrate based diets lead to funguses like candida growing in the intestines and wreaking havoc on the body.</p>

<p>Before the comet impact 10,000 years ago, people lived in perfect harmony in nature and were incredibly more physically and mentally healthy. The comet impact destroyed the worlds ecosystem and people were forced to start growing crops/farming animals to survive. There bodies/brains went from burning ketones for energy to burning glucose for energy. People were able to store and sell food, and money was created to facilitate trade. Characteristics like selfishness and greed increased chances of survival, whereas the hunter gatherers were caring and shared everything.</p>

<p>This switch to a carbohydrate based diet and new economic system is the main cause of almost every world problem today. A glucose based diet and sedentary diet is the main cause of almost every single disease/mental health issue, and all inequality has a root cause in this societal change.</p>

<p>Where is the conspiracy here? The pharmaceutical industry and many elites know that 99% of disease can be prevented by switching to a ketogenic intermittent fasting diet and exercising. Diabetes, multiple sclerosis, depression, bipolar, epilepsy, cancer, heart disease, and numerous other ailments can be almost entirely eliminated by using a ketogenic intermittent fasting diet and exercising. 
Ketogenic diets have even recently become very popular amongst the silicon valley elite because of the health benefits and greatly increased mental capacity it leads to.
The health care/pharm industry is suppressing evidence that humans evolved to use ketones for energy and that a glucose based diet is the number one contributor to our current health issues. </p>

<p>Cargill is the worlds biggest private company, and has bribed the US government to indoctrinate our children with the belief that a carb/grain based diet is normal. The US government subsidizes the corn industry(Cargil&#39;s marjor crop) and is basically giving billions of taxpayer dollars to a private company for corn/grain that is destroying people&#39;s health. </p>

<p>After the war in Iraq, Cargill took over the agriculture of Iraq and people are now forced to grow cash crop grains instead of eating healthy foods and being self sufficient.</p>

<p>Everyone remembers the food pyramid that was used to indoctrinate the population during primary school. Politicians were bribed by Cargil to trick the population into believing that a carbohydrate/grain based diet is normal and healthy.</p>

<p>The sugar industry also bribed scientists into saying that fat is the cause of health problems and not sugar. When the body burns fat/ketones for energy all of these health problems are eliminated. cholesterol does not build up and the body does not store excess fat.</p>

<p>I was diagnosed with leukemia when I was 15 years old. I did not have insurance and my parents couldn&#39;t afford the typical cancer treatments for me. My parents switched me to a ketogenic diet after doing a ton of research, and I went into remission within a year and am currently cancer free. I was also diagnosed as bipolar and with ADHD when I was in junior high. I no longer have any of those issues and do not take any medications.</p>

<p>I eat a diet where my main source of calories is from coconut oil, and I eat organic vegetables that aren&#39;t sprayed with poison. Lab tests have shown that this diet has greatly increased my human growth hormone, testosterone, and has lowered my heart rate and blood pressure. </p>

<p>TLDR:</p>

<p>Humans evolved eating a ketogenic/intermittent fasting diet and got tons of exercise/sunlight. The comet impact 10k years ago forced people to grow crops and eat a carb/grain based diet where glucose is burned for energy instead of ketones. Our bodies did not evolve to use glucose for energy, or sit inside all day away from the sun and without exercise. This new lifestyle is the cause of 99% of health and societal problems, and this fact is being suppressed by companies like Cargill and pharm companies and politicians in order to profit from grain sales and drugs. </p>

<p>Switch to a ketogenic intermittent fasting diet with lots of sunlight/exercise and your life will be completely transformed.</p>

<p>Here is a short summary of my research, including good quality sources for all of my claims. I just typed this up today so don&#39;t expect and top quality essay, but the info is all good.</p>

<p>Comet Impact In 10,950BC Led to Rise of Civilisations and Agriculture, and its Impact on Human Evolution and Social Development</p>

<p>Ancient stone carvings at Gobeklie Tepe give evidence that a comet struck the Earth around 11,000BC, wiping out entire ecosystems and changing the course of human history. Animal carvings on pillar known as the Vulture Stone depict astrological symbols representing certain constellations and the comet. This comet impact also marks the beginning of the Younger Dryas geological period, which saw a sharp decline in temperature over most of the northern hemisphere. The change of relatively sudden and resulted in a decline of 2-6 degrees Celsius, advances of glaciers, and drier conditions over much the of norther hemisphere. The Younger Dryas period represented a distinct vegetational change in large parts of Europe during which warmer vegetation was replaced by that of a cold climate. 
    The Clovis culture is a prehistoric Paleo-Indian culture that appeared at the end of the last glacial period(11,500-11,000 uncal RCYBP) and disappeared at the beginning of the Younger Dryas period. The most commonly held perspective on the end of the Clovis culture is that of a decline in the availability of megafauna, possibly combined with an increase in a less mobile population. This change was caused by the relatively sudden climate change that occurred at the beginning of the Younger Dryas period caused by the comet impact around 11,000BC. 
    A hallmark of the toolkit associated with the Clovis culture is the distinctly shaped fluted stone spear point used to hunt mammoth and other megafauna. The Clovus culture also ate extinct bison, mastodon, gomphoheres, sloths, tapir, camelops, horse, aquatic animals, and a variety of flora and nuts. (2)  Mammoth are considered the most common megafauna hunted by the clovus culture. Fat analysed from several frozen mammals from the Palaeolithic era contained suitable amounts of n-3 and n-6 fatty acids. With its low plant-animal subsistence ratios for the northern hunter-gatherers, the Palaeolithic diet was probably dominated by animal foods. Some researchers have described the presence of thick layers of subcutaneous fat and even humps on the necks of mummified mammoth carcasses. One medium sized mammoth could have nourished a group of 50 humans for at least 3 months, and by eating the fat of these mammoths, Palaeolithic humans could have obtained clean, low protein energy for long periods of time.(3) This diet of high n-3 fatty acids and lower quantities of protein from mammoth meat, as well as a variety of flora and nuts is consistent with what is known as a ketogenic diet.
    A ketogenic diet is a high fat, medium protein, and low carb diet. This diet results in the body being in a state of ketosis, where ketones are burned for fuel instead of carbohydrates. The liver converts fat into ketones, and the brain and body use it for energy instead of glucose. Ketones are the brains prefered source of energy. Before and right after a baby is born, their body uses ketones for energy. Breast milk is very high in fat and will keep a baby in a state of ketosis, whereas most formula is full of sugar and carbohydrates. 
Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological issues that people have. Switching to a ketogenic diet can completely stop seizures in epileptic people, without need of medication.(4) Almost every form of epilepsy can be fixed by switching to a ketogenic diet. Not only does a ketogenic diet stop seizures in people with epilepsy, but it can have a great impact on preventing and reversing symptoms of MS, Alzheimer’s, and other demyelinating diseases. We are learning more and more about how bad sugar and simple carbs can be for your brain health. Alzheimer&#39;s is sometimes even referred to as type 3 diabetes. These diseases are caused by a breakdown of the myelin coating around nerve cells. Recent studies have shown that demyelination is due to a breakdown in the nerve cell’s ability to use glucose as a primary fuel. Researchers now believe that MS may be due to a combination of degeneration and localized inflammation related to poor glucose uptake. In ketosis, ketones replace glucose as the fuel source for the brain reducing the need for glucose and avoiding the cell’s poor glucose uptake which causes the demyelination. Not only that, but it has been demonstrated that a ketogenic diet decreases reactive oxygen species, increases production of superoxide dismutase and catalase, which noticeably decreases the inflammatory effects of oxidative stress. Ketosis also raises glutihione levels, another antioxidant that decreases inflammation and oxidative stress. Current studies show that a ketogenic diet has positive effects on memory, cognition and diminished inflammation, with evidence of halting or reversing the chronic demyelination that causes these terrible diseases.(5)
    A ketogenic diet can also prevent diabetes, as well as replace insulin for people with type 2 diabetes. Many people have even been declared diabetes free, after switching to a ketogenic diet. A ketogenic diet improves glycemic control in people with type 2 diabetes which leads to discontinuing medication in most instances. (6)
    Ketogenic diet also has a much better effectiveness in treating bipolar disorder compared to medication. People on a ketogenic diet experience mood stabilization that greatly exceeds that achieved with medication, without any adverse effects. Ketosis helps reduce intracellular sodium and calcium, which are believed to help cause bipolar disorder.(13)
Intermittent fasting is a term for various diets that cycle between a period of fasting and non-fasting. Hunter gatherers groups like the Clovis culture will often go days without eating much, until they kill an animal. The Clovis culture, and other hunter gatherer groups have a diet that would be considered a type of intermittent fasting. Studies have shown that fasting improves indicators of health like blood pressure, insulin sensitivity, and inflammation. These findings suggest that fasting has the potential to improve health and reduce the risk of chronic diseases. (7)  Intermittent fasting has also been shown to enhance human growth hormone secretion and amplify the complex rhythms of growth hormone secretion in humans.(8) Human growth hormone(HGH) is the commonly hailed wonder drug used my most celebrities, athletes, and wealthy people. People with HGH deficiency have increased body fat, decreased muscle mass, and decreased bone density. These changes in HGH deficient patients micic aging, so it is no wonder that HGH is the best anti ageing hormone. No other hormone has such a profound and amazing impact of overall human health and ageing. HGH injections increase lean body mass, decrease body fat, and increases muscle mass.(9) Increase in HGH levels also leads of better quality sleep, greatly improved skin quality, increased metabolism, improved immune system, greater cardiac output, improved blood pressure, overall tissue regeneration, increased libido, higher energy levels, increased endurance, improved cholesterol levels, improved sight/hearing, improvement in hair/nail quality, prevent or alleviate osteoporosis.(10)
    Another difference in lifestyle between humans in the Palaeolithic time period and humans today is the type and amount of exercise. Hunter gatherers were outside all day either foraging for flora, roots, and nuts, or getting good quality high-intensity training and continuous endurance training while hunting. High-intensity training and continuou endurance training improves aerobic power, body composition, inflammation, and heart rate.(11) This type of cardiovascular exercise also has a positive impact on mental health, including those with depression, anxiety, and schizophrenia.(12)
    Another huge lifestyle difference between modern humans and hunter gatherers is exposure to sunlight. People today often spend the entire day inside at work, getting almost no exposure to natural sunlight. Sunlight exposure regulates our circadian rhythms, our body’s internal clock that regulates sleep cycles and mood. Increased sunlight exposure improves energy levels, concentration, depression, anxiety, vitamin d, and sleep.(14)</p>

<pre><code>What does all of this mean? Before the comet impact around 11,000BC(or whatever other event caused the start of the Younger Dryas period) humans lived as hunter gatherers. They spent most of their day outside in the sunlight and fresh air, getting plenty of quality exercise, and had a very healthy ketogenic diet. Nor were they exposed to harmful chemicals/metal in their water or sprayed on their food. Their exercise and dietary habits also caused them to have higher levels of human growth hormone, which is shown to have an incredible impact on overall health and ageing. They also worked together each day, were very social, and each person in the group was valued. There were no social classes, there was no money, everything was shared. Almost EVERY SINGLE health issue or disease that is currently plaguing our society and costing over 3 trillion dollars a year is completely due to the change in diet and lifestyle that occurred after the beginning of the Younger Dryas period and continued until current day. The top 10 causes of death today are heart disease, cancer, chronic respiratory disease, car accidents, stroke, Alzheimer’s disease, diabetes, kidney disease, suicide. Drug overdose and doctor error follow quickly after this list.
The comet impact around 11,000BC killed off most of the megafauna, and had a distinct impact on the vegetation. These factors had a profound impact on human development and were the driving factor leading to the first civilisations. The small number of megafauna and change in vegetation due to rapid climate change could no longer support the hunter gather groups like the Clovis culture. Most of the population died off, and the survivors needed to rely on new methods to survive. People learned how to grow crops and cultivate the land and needed to group together to form the earliest civilizations. The high fat ketogenic diet that hunter gatherers evolved with for thousands of years could no longer be maintained, and the primary food source became carbohydrate rich grains and vegetables. 
This massive lifestyle change also lead to the beginning of economics as we know it. Hunter gatherers shared everything between themselves, these early civilizations would now have to deal with the new concepts of supply/demand, surpluses and shortages. As well as the issue of private property used for agricultural purposes. A form of currency was needed in order to facilitate trade. Things like metals, animals bones, and shells were no longer used for just art and jewelry, but as currency to facilitate the exchange of good. 
Hunter gatherers evolved to have traits of generosity, good physical health, ability to work with other, showed more warmth and affection toward their children. Hunter gatherer songs are less wordy and characterized by more nonwords, repetition, and relaxed enunciation. Sharing of knowledge and experience was vital to the survival of the group.
People in the early civilizations of the Younger Dryas era needed to rely on much different traits in order to thrive. Creativity, intelligence, ingenuity were now much more important for survival. As was another character trait unheard of in hunter gatherers, selfishness.

<p>No, it wasn&#39;t.  It&#39;s speculated.  The work hasn&#39;t been peer reviewed and it&#39;s already being viewed extreeeemely skeptically by other experts in the field.  Same thing happens with all of Hancock&#39;s work.  He doesn&#39;t have a great reputation for accuracy anymore.  He still does fascinating work though, don&#39;t get me wrong there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great post!</p>

<p>Have you had a chance to look into the theory of mushrooms/hallucinogens being the main cause of the growth of our brain? Heard about it a while ago but haven&#39;t had to chance to look into it. </p>

<p>I strongly believe the effect of hallucinogens on human evolution is vastly underestimated. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t see how use of psychedelics would influence brain size, but I&#39;m not a neurochemist. But when you consider synesthasia, the mixing of senses, it makes perfect sense that humans who were tripping could begin to associate things they were seeing with spoken language. And the next step is to connect spoken word with symbols on a page or clay tablet. The ritualistic use of drugs is also crutial to the formation of strong group ties outside of the usual familial ones. I think humans would have needed an already sizeable brain to make any kind of meaningful use of the benefits of drugs. That&#39;s not to say it couldn&#39;t have all gone hand in hand, sort of a chicken and the egg.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think farming was just easier. Hunter and gather lifestyle isnt made out to be easy, with no modern day equipment chasing down woodley mammoths or even bisons is very dangerous. Also farming allows you to domestic animals. </p>

<p>I do believe its sourced from everything else you mentioned. All for the sake of profit, they distorted the science and corrupted doctors. With all the money put into wars there is no way it isnt possible to have good quality grass fed meat and butter for everyone. Just all part of the depopulation narrative, tell everyone we dont even have enough of the shitty food for everyone so dont even think about the kobe grass fed shit. The more we demand it, the greater our expectations is for our own health will force a change in the industry. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If farming was easier why weren&#39;t they farming before that? They could have had farms and raised animals, but hunting was a huge part of their life. Hunters enjoyed chasing down animals, I don&#39;t think it was some super hard task that they hated doing. But I wasn&#39;t around back then so I can&#39;t be sure.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because they didnt discover farming. Yes hunting was hard, even with a rifle chasing down a buck is not a easy task. Also gutting the animal and transporting the meat back home is not easy when you have tons of meat with bears and other predators swarming to the meat at over a mile radius. During the winter your family can easily starve to death, I mean even with farming many settlers died from bad harvest. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hunting really wasn&#39;t that hard. It wasn&#39;t easy, but it certainly wasn&#39;t so difficult that they ever had to worry about starving to death. These are people who were raised learning how to hunt and had thousands of years to develop traps and methods to kill animals. Fat from the animals they hunted can be stored safely for thousands of years. You can find containers of bog fat that are still edible after being in a swamp for thousands of years. Nobody starved to death during the winter, because their main food source was animals, mostly mammoths.... Crop die in the winter but all the animals are still around. Not sure why you think winter would make them disapear. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you have any experience hunting? Hunting is dangerous and requires a ton of calories running through the forest often tracking animals for days before you get a chance to take aim. Like I said earlier even with rifles and hunting bows its still a difficult task. Hippos arent as big as mammoths and they are very dangerous and has a very thick hide, you really think its was that easy to kill this beast with a stick? What information do you have that supports your data that winters werent harsh and food was plentiful? How come the pilgrims who had guns didnt hunt when thier crops failed? Also when mammoths were still around our ancestors failed to leave behind any mass production pottery work, that means they didnt have enough freetime due to the difficult of getting food. </p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleolithic#Diet_and_nutrition">it only takes a cursory look at the evidence to find that the people who had the most significant eating of meat were those in more northern regions, in other words, even the most meat eating amongst us still ate tons of plant foods</a></p>

<p>The only real society that eats almost 95-100% animal foods, is the inuit, and they get  atherosclerosis at a higher rate than most populations, before they even switched to a western diet evidence shows that even mummified inuits (they&#39;ve only looked at two) had  atherosclerosis </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Completely false. Read on the fossilized poop remains of Paleo people. They ate a diet extremely low in saturated fat. You&#39;re referring to Eskimos and people who lived on the fringes of society and relied on megafaunna (and plants). The brain runs on glucose which comes from plants, not animal fat. Animal fat is devoid of all nutrients really besides calories.</p>

<p>The fact of the matter there is no evidence whatsoever that the average Paleolithic human ate large amounts of animal fat. The only example we have of that is literally the Inuit peoples. The evidence shows majority of humans lived in warm climates ideal for foraging all types of plants. It doesn&#39;t mean they wouldn&#39;t eat animals but it&#39;s a far cry away from a animal fat based diet which has no evidence to back it.</p>
