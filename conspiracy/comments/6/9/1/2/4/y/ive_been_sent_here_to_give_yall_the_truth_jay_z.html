Nowhere seems to be too far&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;She remember my Sprinter, said &quot;I was in the grape van&quot;(rape van)&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The pop community, I mean these bitches come with union fee&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Any rumor you ever heard about me was true and legendary
I done got Lewinsky and paid secretaries
For all my n*****s with babies by bitches
That use they kids as meal tickets
Not knowin&#39; the disconnect from the father
The next generation will be the real victims
I can&#39;t fault &#39;em, really&quot;</p>

<p>and then theres:</p>

<p>&quot;Instagram is the best way to promote some pussy&quot;</p>

<p>My point is that it appears that a private citizen was trying to convey some information and it appears there may be some sort of...conspiracy to stop him from doing so.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What information? &quot;facebook is fake?&quot;. Duh. or &quot;Jay Z knows bad guys&quot;. That&#39;s not exactly news. He was above the crowd and could have really revealed something earth shattering if he wanted to and nobody could have stopped him up there. They could have cut his mic or even shot him if it was a REAL big deal. But instead he said that the internet lies. not convinced this is news. I&#39;m a huge fan of conspiracies and come here daily, but Kanye West, the rapper, isn&#39;t privy to super secrets. The more plausible explanation, if one is even needed,  is that he&#39;s a drug fiend or crazy guy and went wacko or a few minutes. Even then though, he didn&#39;t reveal shit. </p>
