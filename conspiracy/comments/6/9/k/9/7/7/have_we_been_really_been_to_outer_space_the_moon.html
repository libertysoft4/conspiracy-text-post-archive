The nature of this reality is stranger than we&#39;ll ever know, but a flat earth isn&#39;t the half of it.  We survive in a space bubble because that&#39;s how our reality was designed.  The books will tell you all you need to know.  Basic instructions before leaving earth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well we&#39;re already in outer space as we speed along on this planet. The reason they disappear into the horizon is because the force of gravity is calculated as part of the trajectory. It&#39;s a good question but when I looked it up I found out about &quot;gravity turn&quot; pretty fast and it does make sense. I mean, I haven&#39;t actually left the atmosphere myself but the wikipeda page for this makes sense.<br/>
I don&#39;t know if we can really survive in a little ship or how space junk is avoided.<br/>
The thing that sort of puzzles me is how it takes massive amounts of equipment to get to the moon but getting back is relatively easy. I know there is less gravity and no atmosphere but still it&#39;s the trip back from the moon that is the mind-blowing part. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What is so mind blowing about returning from the moon? In space no gravity or atmosphere means that you need only enough fuel to start the journey this means one boost in the right direction and you can reach your destination in an amount of time without needing to overcome a force like gravity that keeps us on this planet, as we hurtle through space. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not quite. Gravity still exists in space... that&#39;s what keeps the moon in orbit.</p>

<p>What you have to remember is that gravity follows the &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse-square_law">inverse square law</a>&quot;. </p>

<p>As a ship travels between the earth and the moon, the effect of earth&#39;s gravity reduces, and the effect of the moon&#39;s gravity increases. There is a point in between them where the two effects cancel out, but other than that the ship is either climbing up out of earth&#39;s &quot;gravity well&quot; or falling down into the moon&#39;s &quot;gravity well&quot;.</p>

<p>Getting from earth to the moon takes a hell of a lot of fuel because you have to escape earth&#39;s much stronger gravitational field. Coming back the other way takes a lot less because you only have to escape the moon&#39;s weaker gravitational field.</p>

<p>For most of the trip back to earth, earth&#39;s gravity is accelerating the ship towards it, and no fuel is required.</p>

<p>Because that&#39;s how you go to space. You don&#39;t go straight up, you go in a more sideways fashion. Given the Earth is round, the space ships end up disappearing over the horizon. </p>

<p>Yes</p>

<p>That&#39;s the same question. </p>

<p>Space is big. There&#39;s a lot of room. </p>

<p>Whenever someone says we can&#39;t get past the Van Allen Belts, ask them where they get their information about the belts. Their source of information will lead to a space agency that supports space travel. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I cant take it seriously, I already started trolling other subs with people posting stupid question and a short while later another posts the same bloody thing. </p>

<p>What bugs me here, is that a part of me wants to believe there are people out there who just dont have the knowledge gathered through higher education to understand the science/logic behind some of the stuff we talk about. But these people have enough, coupled with exposed lies, to question and be skeptical about other things like other &#39;conspiracy theories&#39;. Uet on the other hand, a part of me thinks that bots and shills are trying to discredit this sub with shitposts about flat earth and fake spacewalks, trying to take the limelight from real discussion of the &#39;official&#39; narrative and other possibilities. Mainly the political discussions and posts that happen. Because anywhere else on reddit, post a comment that questions the OP and you get inta downvoted. </p>

<p>The moon landings can easily be proved since nasa published the previously catalogued and unreleased images from the pre 2000s on the website somewhere. I have seen them, pretty cool stuff. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. Not to mention, with a decent telescope, you can see the god damn ISS, which is another thing that apparently is the biggest cover-up in the world, because NASA lives to defraud the world while it researches microgravity effects on mice. There is plenty of shit in this world that is at least possible that we are being lied to about, without all the ignorant fucks clogging up the sub with bullshit about how they can prove we never went to the moon because why is the flag waving and blah blah. I refuse to believe that a sentient, adult human can look at the facts and come to the conclusion that we never went to the moon.</p>

<p>What I can assure you is that there are answers for all your questions and they can be fairly easily backed up. Concerning space debris it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_debris#Threats">is becoming a concerning issue</a> but fortunately we have people working on ways to resolve this. If you hadn&#39;t seen it, <a href="https://twitter.com/Cmdr_Hadfield/status/860561301810053122">here&#39;s a tweet</a> an astronaut made showing the impact of space debris.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Spacewalks are dangerous just for that reason. Difference being now we have the tech both out there and on earth that scans the sky for the debris, junk, and objects so that if something truly dangerous were to appear we would know, still with an error margin though. </p>

<p>An answer to your question regarding true space travel in a pressurized can in 0g, 0atm, danger that is space is: Yes and no. It is dangerous as you described. and particles traveling as much faster speed that we can creat, are a huge threat. But if you look around today science fiction is become science fact at a very fast rate. 100 years ago we didnt even have supercomputers in our pockets, and planes didnt fly all that well, and there was no 3d printing, and genome manipulation etc. Just a 100 years. Maybe in a 100 more we will be able to create hard light, or electromagnetic shield, or brake the energy storage problems of today all of which will help us live in outer space. But and there is a huge issue here, the 0gs effects on biological structures such as us, is still being researched and atm the science is pointing to us needing something big to either create artificial gravity, or be forced to have genetic issues, both in travelers and those being born, growing, etc. </p>

<p>why these rockets and shuttles going to space seem to never go up but always seem to disappear into the horizon?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/Vhac1T9.png">Here is a crude diagram to help explain it</a></p>

<p>Let&#39;s assume a rocket takes off and flies in a dead straight line. The top row shows a sequence of our spherical planet (green circle) rotating in space. The yellow line is the launch point. As the planet rotates, the yellow line rotates with it. The red line is the path of the rocket travelling straight up.</p>

<p>The second row is the spherical planet as we see it - essentially flat because the curve is so shallow. What we see is the rocket travelling straight up while the launch point moves away to the left.</p>

<p>The bottom row is all these images overlaid so that the launch point stays motionless, the way you would see it if you were standing on the surface some distance away. Now we see the red vertical lines moving off to the right. The curved red line connecting them is the path the rocket takes from the perspective of the observer.</p>

<p>As you can see, even if the rocket travels in a dead straight line, it will appear to move on a curving path away from the observer because the planet is rotating underneath the rocket.</p>

<p>In reality, the rocket is not travelling in a dead straight line because it is trying to enter orbit around the earth. For this to happen it needs to gain lateral speed as well as vertical speed so that it is travelling fast enough around the planet to stay in orbit.</p>

<p>Because our planet is a sphere, what this looks like is the rocket initially going up in a curve that then seems to drop back down as it passes beyond the horizon.</p>
