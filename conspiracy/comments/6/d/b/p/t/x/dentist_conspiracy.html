<p>Going to disagree with you here. If you tried to drill out a cavity or abscess that went into the nerves you&#39;d be in excruciating pain for years, maybe even a lifetime. Try living with a &quot;hot tooth&quot; for even a week and then tell me root canals are quackery. You&#39;d be begging for one.</p>

<p>It&#39;s just that they&#39;re expensive, and they freak people out. 2 things that would make people question them. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying they&#39;re not over-diagnosed, and i&#39;m not saying that the &quot;dangers&quot; of an abcess aren&#39;t <em>greatly</em> exaggerated. </p>

<p>The real conspiracy is dental insurance. Dental insurance coverage has been fixed at $1500 since its conception over 70 years ago. Unless you get free dental through your job, you&#39;re getting a couple hundred bucks <em>tops</em> covered. And anything expensive comes right out of your pocket. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, to me braces seem so unnatural, but I think the real issue is what causes peoples teeth to be crooked in the first place. I think it&#39;s about nutrition in the early years, both in utero and the first few years of development. If you achieve optimal levels of nutrition your jaw will be wide and your teeth will be correctly aligned, however if you don&#39;t then you end up with a narrow jaw and crooked teeth. Today people eat lots of food, but are getting less and less nutrition. As well as all those chemicals disrupting out bodies proper functions. When people take steroids, it expands their bones and jaws due to the muscles pulling on them, and I think coupled with an excellent diet, this is what allows them to function or achieve the optimal form in later stages of development. I think if people try steroids but don&#39;t eat properly it will cause major health problems.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If your orthodontist finds cavities, he&#39;s going to send you back to the general dentist. The orthodontist will not profit from this diagnosis at all. </p>

<p>The truth of the matter is that different doctors have different criteria
 So for one doctor the tiny amount of decay is not enough to consider it a cavity, since simply brushing could potentially arrest the decay. To another doctor, they know patients aren&#39;t great with hygiene, so it is best to tell the decay now and maybe do a small filling instead of letting it get bigger and then doing a root canal or losing the tooth. </p>

<p>The truth if the matter is fillings are not where dentists make their money, t is a very cheap procedure that insurance companies don&#39;t reimburse much for. If your dentist is trying to give you a filling, he/she is honestly saving you a lot more money in the long run. </p>

<p>I will say this. There are 100000% some shady dentist out there. I wan to dispel the idea that there is a huge conspiracy with dentist trying to steal your money, but there are some dentist who do exactly that. Make sure you go to a trustworthy dentist, and stay away from corporate offices. This gives you the best shot of finding someone who legitimately cares about doing good work.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I had the same thing.  Went to a new dentist, had &quot;three cavities&quot;, he wanted all the payment upfront.  I didn&#39;t have dental at the time, so I went to my childhood dentist when I was visiting my parents. Miraculously, I had no cavities.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe it is like there are some good dentists, just like some good and bad mechanics.  Some give it to you straight, and some not.  Seems like my poor friends that use dentists that are paid by government insurance do more work... but might be that poor people let things fester longer as they don&#39;t realize it is cheaper to get it done asap.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>very interesting topic as i&#39;ve experienced the same thing...</p>

<p>went to my dentist after years of not going, said i needed to get my wisdom teeth removed because they had cavities that were beyond repair. i got a second opinion - guess what - THEY DIDN&#39;T SEE ANY CAVITIES.</p>

<p>but it&#39;s odd, because what would my dentist have to gain by sending me to an oral surgeon? unless there was some kind of &quot;kickback&quot; for every customer they refer to the oral surgeon.</p>

<p>just blows my mind really.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Went to a dentist with my 6 year old daughter who still has all milk teeth. She had one cavity. Dentist wanted to do a root canal.</p>

<p>Forget that. Went to a second dentist. </p>

<p>She wanted to do all the X-rays from new. She was just going to take out the tooth. Gave an injection, all was fine, but my taught er panicked when her lip became numb. She said her lip feels like rubber, which is normal. The dentist refused to proceed saying she will have trauma and we should come again. Had to pay her anyway for the X-ray and consultation.
Went to her a week later again, and the same thing happened. Still had to pay her.
Asked for her to make an appointment with a dentist who uses gas. She knew one. So I took my taught er there expecting it to be a follow on.</p>

<p>New dentist insisted on new X-rays. I told him to get them from the other dentist. No, he made new. Also he began like she was a new patient. After all this, she finally got in the chair and he looked inside. He somehow found another two cavities that the other two dentists missed. Then he said, ok, we are finished. I sad, what about the tooth ? He said this is just first visit, he will do the tooth next time. Also insisted that she uses toothpaste with fluoride. I told him I never use fluoride, and I have never lost a tooth or had a filling. He still insists. Charges me another hundred for this visit. </p>

<p>Now after 4 dentists and 600 euros, my daughter still has her cavity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dentists are also &quot;doctors&quot; and go through the same routine indoctrination as all MDs do. </p>

<p>And a dentist can indeed make a great deal of money with the right kind of clientele, just as any MD can and there are probably just as many unscrupulous dentists out there who are only in it for the money as there are unscrupulous doctors out there who order completely unnecessary tests and treatments or prescribe all kinds of unnecessary drugs in order to fatten-up their bank accounts.</p>

<p>Most, however, are well meaning and believe in what they are doing but the onus is always on the patient to know his own body and to personally decide what they believe is or isn&#39;t good for it after reviewing as much information about their situation as they possibly can.</p>
