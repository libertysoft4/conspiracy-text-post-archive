<p>Indeed. Crony-Capitalism is the problem, along with Consumerism, and Globalism (in it&#39;s current form). Which is why we must abolish government and self rule. Corporations in their current form can only exist when there is a government to corrupt.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Completely agree. I believe people would truly benefit (and be better off) living simpler lives (ie. homesteading - growing food, raising livestock, hunting, fishing, etc etc).</p>

<p>Yes, yes it is. Profit is truly subjective, and it&#39;s not always monetary.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Well true, but that&#39;s a business. Both parties are voluntarily exchange goods. The boss wants your skills and time, and in return pays you what you agreed (ie. a paycheck).</p>

<p>I suggest learning some basic economics.</p>

<p>The capitalist pays you an amount less than the value that you produced for the market, thus extracting profit off your labor.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>an economic system characterized by private or corporate ownership of capital goods, by investments that are determined by private decision, and by prices, production, and the distribution of goods that are determined mainly by competition in a free market</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/capitalism">https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/capitalism</a></p>

<ol>
<li>Private = you</li>
<li>Ownership = things you own (ie. your time, skills, things you create, etc etc)</li>
</ol>

<p>So, now that we have that down. You own a playstation 4, I do not. I want a ps4, so I ask if you would like to trade me. You ask what I have, and I say: &quot;Well, I have a rubber duck, a gold coin, a button&quot;. You stop me and say: &quot;I will trade you for your golden coin&quot;. </p>

<p>Now, do I want that ps4 more than my golden coin (mmm, sure). So, we voluntarily trade, if I think that is worth my golden coin. End of transaction. We go off on our merry own ways, happily knowing we just profited (ie. got something we did not have before).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nope. Still applies if you build something yourself. If it costs you $40 to build a chair, in order to profit from it, you raise the price of what you want in trade for it, and what others are willing to trade for it. </p>

<p>For the sake of money, if people only think it&#39;s worth 35$, you either lower the price (take a hit), or figure out how to lower the price in producing it (ie. costing you only $30 to accept the rate of $35 that people are willing to trade you for it).</p>

<p>It&#39;s basic economics, and how so many people do not understand it, worries me about the countries future (and humanity, for that sake).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you&#39;re onto something here.</p>

<p>When nobody has the resources to damage the system, the only option is voluntary non-participation. We&#39;re trained young to participate and are penalized for not participating. It&#39;s ingrained into our psyche that non-action is non-productive. In actuality, non-action is a choice to not act.</p>

<p>So they keep us divided so that if one side says &quot;everyone just stop for a minute&quot; the other side says &quot;you just want to kill all the kittens in the world!&quot; or something oblique like that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>this has been my say.. everyone needs to wake up and nonviolently stand down. imagine being able to band together and just walk right up to TPTB and slap cuffs on em? its farfetched/sorta ideaistic and would take alot of cooeration but its doable.. and realistically whats best for us. </p>

<p>then we need to be sure about how governing ourselves will play out.. vetting everything... and not let any charlatans step up to &quot;help&quot;</p>

<p>But it&#39;s not easy. As shown by the latest mass demonstrations and protest, mass media support and promotion would be needed to make a significative percentage of the population to leave the couch and act.</p>

<p>And you can bet it would happen if, say, one day marshals arrested Hillary or someone of her ilk. I can already see the newstertainers barking on TV, every young person dragged to the streets by their idols and <em>social media influencers</em>, corporate America flexing its&#39; muscles.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is vague, but if it is determined that it creates a national emergency it is illegal. </p>

<p>NATIONAL EMERGENCY STRIKES</p>

<p>The Taft-Hartley Act gives the president of the United States the power to intervene when a strike becomes a &quot;national emergency strike.&quot; National emergency strikes are those that can endanger national health or safety. The president may appoint a board of inquiry charged with making a report of the situation. Based upon this report, the president could apply for an injunction restraining the strike for 60 days. If there has been no resolution at the end of 60 days, the injunction can be extended for another 20 days. During this period, employees are polled in a secret ballot to determine their willingness to comply with the terms of their employer&#39;s last offer.</p>

<p>The dream of repeating 1946 is constrained by –- among a multitude of factors —  legal barriers erected in the years since. The 1947 Taft-Hartley Act prohibits unions from calling strikes in solidarity with other workers. It also prohibits wildcat and political strikes. Since Taft-Hartley, organized labor has, on the whole, been on the back foot. As Robyn D. G. Kelley, professor of American History at UCLA, noted, even the most militant recent labor struggles are “simply fighting to save collective bargaining and union recognition.” </p>
