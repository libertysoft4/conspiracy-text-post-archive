I&#39;m interested to hear r/conspiracy&#39;s thoughts on the theories surrounding nephilim, annunaki, giant races, etc, and how it&#39;s all interconnected to the secret societies that have basically run the world for centuries/millennia. I tend to come at these things from a Jesus-based point of view (a lot of my research that I&#39;ve done reflects that as well), but I would love to hear other people&#39;s thoughts and ideas on these topics.</p>

<p>I&#39;m excited to see what you guys think. </p>

<p>I agree that channeling entities are actually just demons being channeled. But the Anunnaki are our whole existence, it&#39;s much much deeper!</p>

I recently (a couple months ago) heard the story of the Khandahar giant told by a couple of Army Rangers.

    <div class="md"><p>The fact that you included Punt Guns (<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punt_gun">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punt_gun</a>) in those pictures along with Rober Wadlow (longest human to have ever lived <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Wadlow">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Wadlow</a>) in part 2 already discredits both posts <strong>for me</strong>.</p>

<p>Robert Wadlow wasn&#39;t the same type of &quot;giant&quot; you claim him to be. &quot;His great size and his continued growth in adulthood were due to hyperplasia of his pituitary gland, which results in an abnormally high level of human growth hormone.&quot; </p>

<p>Also he died at the age of 22.</p>

<p>Yes, some of those pictures might be legit. But having them mixed with pictures that can be rationally explained discredits the whole thing to be honest.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To a nonbeliever like me, this behavior has an alternative purpose that is right in front of us. Instead of believing that they are really afraid of Jesus&#39; name for inexplicable hidden reasons, perhaps they are using conditioning on us to get us to believe in religion based mind control systems again. There are other instances of this strange behavior.</p>

<p>For instance, the new age presenters often suggest that the dark will glee the light if it shines sufficiently. They define it as rejecting fear and embracing love. I see something ingenious and insidious in this.</p>

<p>These dark beings are spiritual parasites. They feed on fear and suffering. The energy they actually feed on is generated by beings in positive emotional states (love based) and radiated by beings in negative emotional states (fear based). By being in the same base emotional frequency that the ones radiating this energy are in, these spiritual parasites absorb it, gaining pleasure, vitality, mental focus and more. It is an energy of mind and it supposedly also facilitates mind over matter abilities. These parasites essentially farm this energy from life in space. </p>

<p>Negative emotions, based on fears, are there for one purpose, survival of the self and what it values. They are together a suite of behaviors that a designed to protect us and our loved ones from threats. Because of the imperative of threat, fear shuts found our complex thought so we can act quickly in fight or flight. This works well against predators in nature. It makes us vulnerable to intelligent predators though. They know the system is easy to manipulate with deception in ignorance. Trolls on Earth are very much like these dark beings. They feel better by making others feel worse, gratifying their own egos and while beating up others with their own apparently superior intellect. Give such people millions of years of evolution and the wisdom of this spiritual energy and you get pretty much the same result.</p>

<p>Now, think about the farming from that perspective, ancient, intelligent, malevolent space troll parasites managing their resource exploitation operations. Do they really want to destroy the ability of their cattle to create the energy they want to harvest? Of course not. They want to capture it and use it as long as they can before it dies due to their spiritually parasitic burden. They work in hidden places to get fear and suffering, energy harvest. They use our elites primarily. They also hide with technology and do other operations. They even infest our minds impersonating our own thoughts as well as other beings in our communications with otherworldly beings. </p>

<p>They are the ultimate hackers of technology, societies, minds and SOULS, which are roughly equivalent to incarnate personalities, but which survive through all of the lifetimes of a dividuation of God, of consciousness. Souls still have unique belief systems and perspectives of their own based on their experiences throughout their lifetimes. </p>

<p>Hacking souls requires hacking their beliefs, through the corruption of their experiences over time. It turns them against the God inside, which is consciousness itself, as well as making them turn against love due to the lessons they learned from their own pain of experience. The moment they embrace only fear and selfishness and abandon love, they turn against God and align with the disease that the dark beings align with, a soul feeding abomination people call the devil. It&#39;s really more a hive of like minded beings turning others into their energy collecting slaves though. It&#39;s all about the choice to either treat others with the respect you want to receive or to treat them as mere resources to serve yourself. If you want to be a parasite, the parasites already think in that wavelength and do it far better than you do. That&#39;s why their thoughts become your thoughts and then you can&#39;t separate your own thoughts and beliefs from theirs, their hive, your future new being.</p>

Yet we never hear credible people with good evidence talking about secretive subjects. It is always people who seem a little unhinged and they are typically trying to sell a book or website. </p>

<p>The bigger the conspiracy the less likely it is real. Simple fact you can&#39;t keep people quite.</p>

<p>&quot;&quot;The land through which we have gone, in spying it out, is a land that devours its inhabitants; and all the people whom we saw in it are men of great size. 33&quot;There also we saw the Nephilim (the sons of Anak are part of the Nephilim); and we became like grasshoppers in our own sight, and so we were in their sight.&quot;</p>

<p>How big is a giant when you see it and consider yourself like a grasshopper in comparison?   </p>

<p>Also means egyptian paintings make more sense, with  seemingly  people being randomly painted as large and some as small.  </p>

<p>And then you have the first reports from patagonia, etc.  </p>

<p>Honestly, I think more and more people are starting to see these things may actually be true.  As has been foretold. </p>

<p>&quot;17For there is nothing hidden that will not be revealed, and nothing concealed that will not be known and illuminated.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The note about Grasshoppers might not be about size. When Grasshopper population become too large and crowded, they become cannibalistic. Locusts are just Grasshoppers in cannibalistic mode. So perhaps the quote is saying that the Nephilim see us spreading out across the land and crowding to the point where we become like Grasshoppers (Locusts): Cannibalizing each other.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not so far fetched to me. Think about the scale the dinosaurs were before their extinction. Before that event everything was big. Plants and animals. With less resources everything got smaller. If there were humanoids at that time they likely would have been a similar scale. Even if we&#39;re talking 13,000 years ago instead of millions, we still know life existed on this planet at that scale. Even now with the blue whale for example. I don&#39;t understand why people are so skeptical of smaller giants too like the 8-9 foot tall ones in the USA. We have people alive now that are close to that height. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, the Nephilim were real. More and more people are waking up to the true history of mankind. That&#39;s why shows like Ancient Aliens are popular. Anyway, the Watchers were demons who basically became rulers of man at one point and exposed us to advanced technology and conducted experiments using genetic engineering. This created giants and all sorts of freaks of nature like the Centaur. Some believe the Watchers actually &#39;created&#39; the dinosaurs(which is why they didn&#39;t make it on the ark). Ancient People worshipped them as gods and this is why royal families have been attempting to preserve their bloodlines for centuries. They descend from the Watchers and feel that this makes them above the rest of mankind. If you go to England, the royal family has a plaque where they claim to be descendants of Odin. Odin was either a Watcher or Nephilim who people worshipped.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To a nonbeliever like me, this behavior has an alternative purpose that is seeable, right in front of us. Instead of believing that they are really afraid of Jesus&#39; name for inexplicable hidden reasons, perhaps they are using conditioning on us to get us to believe in religion based mind control systems again. There are other instances of this strange behavior for the same base purpose, control.</p>

<p>For instance, the new age presenters often suggest that the dark will flee the light if you shine it sufficiently. They define it as rejecting fear and embracing love. I see something ingenious and insidious in this. Before I explain that, you have to know what ideas I am working with. </p>

<p>These dark beings are spiritual parasites. They feed on fear and suffering. The energy they actually feed on is generated by beings in positive emotional states (love based) and radiated by beings in negative emotional states (fear based). By being in the same base emotional frequency that the ones radiating this energy are in, these spiritual parasites absorb it, gaining pleasure, vitality, mental focus and more. It is an energy of mind and it supposedly also facilitates mind over matter abilities. These parasites essentially farm this energy from life in space. </p>

<p>Negative emotions, based on fears, are there for one purpose, survival of the self and what it values. They are together a suite of behaviors that are designed to protect us and our loved ones from threats. Love based emotions are there to facilitate growth, nourishment for the mind, body and/or soul. Even cells have these two basic models of operation. Because of the imperative of threat, fear shuts down our complex thought so we can act quickly in fight or flight. This works well against predators in nature. It makes us vulnerable to intelligent predators though. They know the system is easy to manipulate with deception in ignorance. </p>

<p>Trolls on Earth are very much like these dark beings. They feel better by making others feel worse, gratifying their own egos and while beating up others with their own apparently superior intellect. Give such people millions of years of evolution and the wisdom of this spiritual energy dynamic and you get pretty much the same result, useless eaters, spiritual parasites, what some call demons. Yet, that term is laden with dogma and false ideas, misleading people about the true nature of these beings, which is the choice to be a parasite. </p>

<p>Now, think about the farming from that perspective, ancient, intelligent, malevolent space troll parasites managing their resource exploitation operations. Do they really want to destroy the ability of their cattle to create the energy that they want to harvest? Of course not. They want to capture the cattle and use them as long as they can before the golden goose of energy generation dies due to their spiritually parasitic burden. </p>

<p>They work in hidden places to get fear and suffering, energy harvest. They use our elites primarily. They also hide with technology and do other operations. They even infest our minds impersonating our own thoughts as well as other beings in our communications with supposedly otherworldly beings. </p>

<p>They are the ultimate hackers. They undermine the integrity of systems, insert deceptive information into them, and then subvert and control then. This is how they hack technology, societies, minds and SOULS, which are roughly equivalent to incarnate personalities, but which survive through all of the lifetimes of a dividuation of God, of consciousness. Souls still have unique belief systems and perspectives of their own based on their experiences throughout their lifetimes. </p>

<p>Hacking souls requires hacking their beliefs, through the corruption of their experiences over time. The goal is to turn them against the God inside, which is consciousness itself, as well as making them turn against love due to the lessons they learned from their own pain of experience. They no longer generate the energy without love, yet still require it for their soul. Thus they become spiritual parasites. The moment they embrace only fear and selfishness and abandon love, they turn against God and align with the disease that the dark beings align with, a consciousness eating abomination people call the devil. </p>

<p>It&#39;s really more a hive of like minded beings turning others into their energy collecting slaves though. It&#39;s all about the choice to either treat others with the respect you want to receive or to treat them as mere resources to serve yourself. If you want to be a parasite, the parasites already think in that wavelength and do it far better than you do. That&#39;s why their thoughts become your thoughts and then you can&#39;t separate your own thoughts and beliefs from theirs, their hive, your future new being.</p>

<p>A lot of different beings comprise the hive. Virtually any species can be turned into this kind of spiritual vampire with sufficient trauma and abuse experiences. The cowardly reptilians are easy prey for it. They are most often associated with it, but also greys, insectoids and human looking ETs are also in thrall to it. The spiritual choice of how to treat others is key to being controlled by it. That&#39;s why they constantly tempt our minds to be like them. Then we become them and give their wretched hierarchies more lowly bottom feeders to ease their burdens and increase their utility.</p>

<p>Many have suggested that these beings gave us religions, corrupted other religions, attacked some religions that highly resistant to their spiritual corruption like the gnostics and completely destroyed some others. They gave us our corrupted perception of duality, of light and dark, good and evil. They want us to think in inaccurate ways to manipulate us with it, so we act helpless, waiting for saviors, blaming others, being docile, rudimentary and submissive to authority (that they secretly manipulate). They basically want us to be impotent slaves, starting inside our own minds. This is a big purpose for the mind control, besides assimilating us into their hive or causing fear and suffering for energy harvest. </p>

<p>They want us to be as irresponsible, petulant children, who are easy to wield with fear and strong, corrupted, authority. They don&#39;t want independent minded, critical thinking people bold enough to speak their truth, being responsible for their own behavior, acting in love for others to bring understanding, peace, harmony, freedom and joy. Jesus was an aberration from their mind control agenda. He was very much interested in fulfilling the idea behind the previous sentence. He was here to inspire us to do that. If you really examine his behavior, you can see that. So, these spiritual parasites turned his message into a corrupted religion that condemns others for petty things, that demands unquestioning obedience and faith under threat of eternal torment, that caused violence and coercion due to these corruptions and that celebrates Jesus&#39; death more than his life. </p>

<p>So, why do they flee with people say Jesus or if they are loving enough? They want us to find comfort in these mind control systems they control. Farmers do not get scared if their cattle eat grass. If their cattle were intelligent enough to leave, if they willed to strongly enough to do so, perhaps the farmers would feign fear in response to the cows chewing cud, in order to fool the cattle into believing that they are in charge, not the other way around. Intelligence is relative. </p>

<p>The energy farmers are pleased that we generate their food. They don&#39;t want us to declare their farm FUBARED and find a new place to incarnate, because then they loose the energy harvest and a potential spiritual slave. So, they want us to believe there is a battle we can win here. All we have to do is subscribe to a religion? All we have to do is love?  Protection mode thinking will work against us doing that? Wow, what a useful state for a predator to have in their prey! They can keep on eating the prey and their prey is too stunned by bullshit to flee or fight them. They just love, or rather, generate more energy, believing they are somehow improving the situation by doing so. The farmer probably really enjoys that, while he feigns fear. Surely the hive will help him with that if he falters. What a masterfully engineered slave race we have become! Just make more product or pull the wool over our own eyes and we win, and yet still get fed on by the very same spiritual parasites. </p>

<p>We need to embrace love and fear as required aspects of life in freedom and independence. We have to nourish, to grow, to love to even be in a state that we would want to be in, but we also need to protect ourselves from the freeloaders that will inevitably find utility in exploiting us. That requires fear based thought. We need to be mindful of our beliefs, which elicit our emotions, thoughts and form the foundation for dependent beliefs. Deception is easy for this hive with many eyes and minds and they use it to manage us. We need to be much more skeptical of everything, especially what humans and others have stuffed into the perceived mouth of God, because those beliefs have the greatest impact on our emotions and behavior of all. What could be more important than aligning with the architect and manager of the great edifice of existence you find yourself inside? Thus the impact on our minds. </p>

<p>Now, the great secret about these demons isn&#39;t such a secret to some. While God is love and life. These beings are fear and <del>death</del> technology. The hive is technological telepathy that self-serving beings abused to enthrall life to serve themselves, mind control. The end game for this group is tricking us into merging with technology and AI, because they then have a much easier time hacking our souls, by hacking our minds, by hacking the tech we willingly put into our minds. As we integrate more with machines, the more we think like self-serving machines. When we do, they win our souls. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I forgot to mention that the dark poses as the light, as divinely authorized discipline. They secretly undermine the society and individuals then play upon your failures. They actually exist after death and sell you that you need to go back and suffer through unnecessary experiences to pay off karma. They use the three Abrahamic religions as a construct for this deception, posing as a number of beings to gain your consent for more feeding sessions. </p>

<p>They play God, literally, masterfully, and will fool all but those who understand the actual reason why you should treat others the way you would want to be treated. You are all that is and hurting others hurts yourself. If you instead believe that you should because some authority tells you to, they&#39;ll play you like a con artist scamming a retard. You&#39;ll never be good enough for them. You&#39;ll always have a perceived sin to pay them in suffering for and you&#39;ll believe it, slowly turning against your own soul through accumulated painful experiences. They&#39;ll tell you either you go to hell to pay it off quickly or come back to loosh farm Earth and live better this time, enduring their energy feeding, again, that likely caused you to sin anyway.</p>
