        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>You&#39;re giving me hope, r/conspriacy.  Some of you saw my post about <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6cv4gm/an_attack_occurred_at_2233_bst_on_the_22nd_at_22/">the improbable amount of 22s around the Manchester bombing</a> and there were alot of good conversations.  Many of you are catching on that our world is practically the opposite of what we&#39;re told it is.  (Spoiler: reality is magic.)</p>

<p>Today I&#39;d like to share one of the biggest pieces that helped me put the puzzle together: technology.  TPTB have some sort of electromagnetic destabilizer that we&#39;ve seen used on at least three occasions.  Forget what you&#39;ve been told, open your mind, and sharpen your <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor">Occam&#39;s razor.</a>  Let&#39;s compare some &quot;official&quot; stories with some picture and video evidence.</p>

<p>This post is dedicated to Dr. Judy Wood, the sexiest woman alive.</p>

<h2>April 19, 1995; 22 years ago</h2>

<p>Oklahoma City.  The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_City_bombing">official story</a>: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>At 9:02 a.m. the Ryder truck, containing in excess of 4,800 pounds (2,200 kg) of ammonium nitrate fertilizer, nitromethane, and diesel fuel mixture, detonated in front of the north side of the nine-story Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Picture it.  Picture a Ryder (moving) truck jampacked with explosives.  Drive your imaginary truck and park it in front of <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/77/Alfred_P._Murrah_Federal_Building_before_destruction.jpg">a nine-story, steel-and-concrete building.</a>  Now, make your truck explode.  Put yourself right in the middle of the blast radius, see the explosion expand around you, and picture the damage as it hits.</p>

<p>Now look at the damage you&#39;ve done.  What does the building look like?  Is there an almost-circular explosion centered around the bomb?  Did your explosion make the building collapse?</p>

<p>Keep your building in mind when you <a href="https://i.imgur.com/Gv6D4xv.jpg">look at what was left of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building after the attack.</a>  Notice how symmetrical the damage is from top to bottom, the lack of debris, and how there&#39;s no damage to the street where the bomb supposedly went-off..  Also of note is <a href="https://i.imgur.com/0FmldaP.jpg">the damage done to cars nearby</a> which suffered extreme, instant rustification.</p>

<h2>September 11, 2001; 15 years ago</h2>

<p><em>Neww York Citah</em>.  You already know the official story.  Some never-flown-before pilots hijacked passenger planes, made point-perfect course adjustments while flying at a speed exceeding the structural integrity limits of the plane then slammed them into two towers causing fires so magically-awesome they brought down 7 buildings.  Meanwhile, another batch of hoodlums managed to hijack a third plane and make it invisible before slamming it into the Pentagon.  (And <em>how the fuck</em> did I believe that was true for so long?  Oh right, I forgot to ask questions.)</p>

<p>&#39;Aides and &#39;ents, it is my extreme pleasure to introduce you to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yri3ZSVjjnA">Dr. Judy Wood.</a>  She coined a term for what happened, <em>dustified</em>.  If you&#39;ve read this far and still suspect it&#39;s madness, I can only ask that you watch the linked interview.  Her science is solid, her <a href="http://drjudywood.com/articles/DEW/">evidence is documented</a>, and she&#39;s the only one with a theory that explains all phenomena observed that day.  She&#39;s so right that a controlled opposition group, Architects and Engineers for 9/11 Truth, was formed to debunk her theory.</p>

<p>We&#39;ve all watched those buildings fall far too many times.  All the WTC buildings fell the same way: symmetrically-inward towards the point of <em>most</em> resistance.  Every one defied the laws of classical physics-- but not the laws of <em>quantum</em> physics.  We again also have the <a href="https://i.imgur.com/OgUPNGH.jpg">instant rustification of cars in the area</a>, also observed <a href="http://drjudywood.com/articles/DEW/dewpics/Image161.jpg">a half-mile away</a>, and <a href="http://drjudywood.com/articles/DEW/dewpics/Image160.jpg">the same thing at the Pentagon.</a>  (These pics and <a href="http://drjudywood.com/articles/DEW/StarWarsBeam5.html">lots more from here.</a>)</p>

<h2>January 19, 2017; 4 months ago</h2>

<p>Plasco Building in Tehran, Iran.  The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasco_Building#Fire_and_collapse">&#39;official&#39; story:</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>On 19 January 2017, a fire started on the ninth floor at around 07:50 local time (04:20 GMT). The building was occupied at the time by its residents, workers at the garment shops, and various tour groups that were being shown around the building. Ten fire brigades arrived to fight the blaze. The combined brigades had been trying to stop the fire for hours—while assuring that the building had been evacuated—when the building&#39;s north wall collapsed without warning, leading to the collapse of the rest of the building a few moments later.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Once again, a burning skyscraper suddenly collapses upon itself.  This event isn&#39;t nearly as well-documented as 9/11, but there is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQM8qTIvixI">footage of the collapse.</a>  If you watch that vid, listen for the only word said by the filmer of the first clip.  Spoiler, it&#39;s <em>dust</em>.</p>

<p>Take a moment and notice the date.  1/19 as opposed to 9/11.</p>

<hr/>

<p>This electromagnetic destabilizer is only one of the toys TPTB have at their disposal.  And if they&#39;re capable of such incredible manipulation of our physical world, just imagine what our society could be like if it weren&#39;t being secretly used to keep us scared.</p>

<p><em>Stay tuned</em>.  I love you all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting, but a bit too much hearsay.</p>

<p>The premise that thermonuclear devices were installed in the 60&#39;s to satisfy building codes is something I am particularly skeptical about. If a requirement was to prove how the building could be demolished before construction could begin, using a thermonuclear device would absolutely be off the table. It was not, and has not been shown to be an efficient way to bring down a building without causing any collateral damage.</p>

<p>If that was a requirement of the building codes, it would be easier to say it would be manually dismantled. This was the method used when the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singer_Building">Singer Building</a> was demolished in 1968. The NYC building codes are posted online, I don&#39;t have time to go through them now but will later.</p>

<p>The original WTC Towers construction would likely fall under their <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/buildings/codes/1938-construction-codes.page">1938 building codes</a>, as it was not <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/buildings/codes/1968-construction-codes.page">amended until 1968</a>, after the towers construction was approved and had begun.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is the idea that the DEW was mounted on a satellite? The ones we know about are currently mounted on battleships and take the entire power capacity of the nuclear engine. (Which raises the question: Why not just use the nuclear power directly, using a tried &amp; true technology -- field tested thousands of times?) How&#39;d they lift it to orbit? What&#39;s the power source?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe the DEW technology has gotten to the point where it could be a smallish type device and placed inside a building or area. Sounds pretty sci-fi, but we know the Deep State is years, and years ahead of the private sector. Think secret space program.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, but we&#39;re hypothesizing multiple technologies not known to exist. Could be interdimensional sonic disintegration pistols for that matter. Why DEW, in particular, if we have no idea what tech they might have? (This is all making me think maybe they&#39;re not as far ahead of us as we&#39;re lead to believe -- that could all be a psyop. David Wilcock sure hasn&#39;t blown me away with his credibility...)</p>

<p>On the other hand, we have well-known, field-tested nuclear technology that explains 99% if not 100% of what was seen that day -- and the remaining 1% may be chalked up to psyop information haze. </p>

<p>I think it&#39;s pretty straightforward: <strong>Ground Zero</strong> was the culmination of the <strong>Manhattan Project</strong>. The Deep State loves their nukes and radiation -- indeed it seems to be their favorite weapon of mass terrorism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The whole structure of the building was disintegrated -- that is, it still looked like steel, but it had the consistency and strength of soft charcoal. You could crumble it with your hand. (That&#39;s why the still-solid top section fell down through it and made huge clouds of dust.) The same would be true of the spire.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll admit: The spire is what got me looking. I spent about a week at DEW, but thermonuclear is just such a more complete, more reasonable explanation. With DEW, you have unknown technology upon unknown technology. Nuclear technology is 70 years old and has been field-tested thousands of times.</p>

<p>And it makes sense that the PsyOp machine has gotta spin up some kinda story to placate the folks that have noticed, &quot;But... the buildings turned to dust! What happened to all the steel, the elevators, filing cabinets, carpet, bathroom fixtures, thousands of miles of pipe and wiring...??&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The short answer is molecular destabilization.  At least, that&#39;s what happened to the buildings.  The cars are basically collateral damage-- due to them being separated from the ground by rubber tires turns, they became <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faraday_cage">Faraday cages</a> and melted.  There&#39;s an especially-damning pic from 9/11 (that I can&#39;t currently find) of one of these melted cars sitting next to a completely-unharmed tree.</p>

<p>By using numerology and mythical symbolism, we can be manipulated it is something we are powerless to oppose.  </p>

<p>All while using technology developed by humans and paid for with our own tax money and former wages and the wealth that was stolen from us via:</p>

<p>two housing bubble busts, one in the late 80s that flopped and the really big one in the 2000s, </p>

<ol>
<li><p>they really must work harder to keep us duped.  </p></li>
<li><p>they are trying to replicate human intelligence and they need more data.</p></li>
<li><p>it will be really dangerous if they learn how, and they intend to replicate it, thought I don&#39;t know if the physical tools can be used too do so but I don&#39;t think it is impossible, human thought is a physical reality, both a product of a reaction and the creation of an action, mirroring the creation of the universe from nothingness to its vastness. </p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>Solar panels get produce more energy by being positioned out of our atmosphere/closer to the sun? That doesn&#39;t make sense to me, the panels already get more sunlight than they can utilize. The panels can only take in so much energy from the sun.  The most cutting edge top of the line panels can make approximately 290-300 kilowatts on earth. In space they would make the same, 290-300 kilowatts. They might get more UV radiation in space, but they can only take in 300 kw</p>

That doesn&#39;t mean go away, but it means it spreads out. I&#39;m no explosive technician, but I would guess that half a mile away from an explosion you could still feel a lot of the heat.

    <div class="md"><p>Have you ever wondered if this has all happened before?  I can&#39;t help but think there were technologically advanced civilizations similar to ours thousands of years ago. However, there is no trace of them in our geological record. Is this kind of technology why there is no trace ?  I really started to wonder about this when Dr Wood talks about the melding of unlike substances. </p>

<p>I personally view these tower sacrifices as a symbolic re-enactment of the destruction of the tower of Babel.</p>
