        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">39</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2017-05-24 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/Sara_Solo.html">Sara_Solo</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It has been 30 hours since the bombing and 14 people--predominantly women of age--are <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/05/23/pls-help-frantic-parents-hunt-missing-kids-manchester-concert/">missing.</a></p>

<p>The bombing took place in Manchester. The city of Manchester is directly next to Rotherham, separated only by a <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Rotherham,+United+Kingdom/Manchester,+United+Kingdom">forest.</a></p>

<p>Rotherham gained infamy in 2014 when it was revealed that a group of pakistani cab drivers were kidnapping white girls from schools and raping them. The sex ring totalled <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/11059138/Rotherham-In-the-face-of-such-evil-who-is-the-racist-now.html">1400 girls.</a></p>

<p>During the Manchester bombing, it began trending on twitter that &quot;muslim cab drivers are giving free rides to concert-goers escaping <a href="https://i.4cdn.org/pol/1495530558564.png?__cf_waf_tk__=034301002EYiBoFgboKT3FZWMSdJGxZ4DWFA">the event.</a></p>

<p>The insinuation is that, based on the past of muslim cab drivers in the neighboring English town, it is possible that these cab drivers both have the infrastructure in place to orchestrate kidnappings, and may have been motivated to act on it to take advantage of the chaos and disarray associated with mass panic.</p>

<p>Additional consideration:</p>

<p>4 of the people still missing are 2 F+M couples. Does this suggest that they left the scene of the crime together and THEN went missing?</p>

<p>Many of the parents/relatives of missing teens are still actively soliciting leads through the twitter hashtag &quot;missinginmanchester&quot;. Therefore it is unlikely that there is difficulty establishing next of kin contact.</p>

<p>Photos emerging from the bomb scene suggest that the bodies <a href="https://i.4cdn.org/pol/1495616152922.jpg">weren&#39;t</a> &quot;mangled beyond recognition&quot; which would have delayed missing persons from being identified as deceased.</p>

<p>Again I want to remind you, don&#39;t downvote this just because you think it&#39;s insensitive. This isn&#39;t a safe space, this is what conspiracy theory is all about.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pure coincidence most likely, but we shouldn&#39;t act like it&#39;s so unconscionable to suggest that the cab drivers could have done this  when the infrastructure is clearly in place for this based on neighboring rotherham. How often are people still missing this long after a terror attack? I&#39;d imagine the families are swarming the hospitals too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Picture yourself as a pious and obedient Muslim who sees prophet Mohammed as the maximum expression of human goodness and what all should aspire to be. </p>

<p>Driving a taxi around Manchester, you happen to pick up a young, distressed little girl who is in shock because of a terrorist attack. Deep down (and because of your teachings) you know this type of things don&#39;t happen to pious Muslims like you (because it hasn&#39;t happened to you), and it&#39;s pretty obvious this young lady comes comes from a place of debauchery and sin (which is the reason why God punishes them with explosions), so you do what every pious Muslim who has seen the light will benevolenty  do by mirroring the actions of your prophet by making this young lady a wife within Islam, at the ripe age of 9, just like the prophet would have it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, seems it is their duty to punish those that are non Muslims, whether by death or rape.</p>

<p>Seems while the Bible got more peaceful as it aged (old to New Testament) the Muslim holy book got more violent.  It apparently started quite peaceful if I understand it correctly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Bible is pretty Savage nevertheless, but when comparing it to the Koran it&#39;s important to remember one is a book and the other one is a revelation, according to each religions mythology. That in of itself is a massive difference. </p>

<p>Regarding your switch in tone, Mohammed wanted to be seen as a new prophet in Judaism (who had all the money and power during that time) so it borrows heavy from Judaism, attempting to appeal to Jews. After Mohammed gets rejected, laughed at and humiliated, the Koran turns much muuch darker and violent </p>

    <div class="md"><p>None. Islam was already on a violent warpath long before the crusades. Christianity, Judaism and zoroastrianism ruled the region for hundreds of years long before Mohammed was born, and where are those religions today? Segregated, isolated, and exterminated, respectively. This is the design of Islam. </p>

<p>Islamic Armies had already reached Tours in France a healthy 350+ years before the first crusade so i wouldn&#39;t pit it as reactionism to western intervention as so many seem to want to do it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The &#39;Muslim&#39; men in those cases?  Actually just &#39;asian&#39; men.  Or as some of us like to call them - &#39;men&#39;.<br/>
All those jobs that brought them into contact with vulnerable young girls out on the streets at night like taxi driving, fast food outlets, 24 hour shops (with their own supply of alcohol)?  Jobs that were done by white men about 30 years ago.  Changing demography.  Of course, those white men back then never took advantage of that situation.  No wait...  They did!  And the papers were constantly full of pedo-ring stories through the 80&#39;s and 90&#39;s involving white people.  The white offenders moved onto the net, being a rung or two up from the immigrants and still carried on grooming right up until now and the newbie asian guys filled the old roles.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t let anybody tell you it&#39;s because of the misogynstic nature of Islam.  That&#39;s racist towards whites. They&#39;re telling you that asian men need an excuse but whites are just predisposed to rape without one.  If anybody is going to point to western culture (porn and scantily clad girls all over the place) then I&#39;ll point out that it&#39;s usually asian shopkeepers that have the best selection.  Couldn&#39;t be from there that they got their attitudes of course.  Must be Islam. Which is strange because they don&#39;t commit more rapes than other races in the UK.  You have to ask yourself - why the fuck are certain people so concerned with selling those cases as being down to Islam? Especially when there are so many non-asian rape cases in Britain (blacks and whites). There&#39;s a million other things to criticise that shit religion for but this one, apart from anything else, ignores an possible interesting cultural (UK)  phenomena (demographics-wise).  It&#39;s all part of the big oil war and civil liberty killing plan and every skinhead twat shouting outside a courtroom is  falling for it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>May 8th, 2012, Manchester</p>

<p>&quot;Nine men of Pakistani and Afghan descent were convicted Tuesday of luring girls as young as 13 into sexual encounters using alcohol and drugs, in a case that has heightened racial tensions in Britain and stirred protests among the far right.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;&quot;We&#39;d get free alcohol, cigarettes, food and <strong>free taxis</strong> and things,&quot; said the girl who went to the police in 2008. &quot;At first I thought it (was) great because nothing had happened, like nothing sexual. Towards the end it was like, it could be up to five different men in a day, sometimes every day, at least four or five times a week.&quot;</p>

I found it highly suspicious how many taxi drivers were allegedly turning off their meters and offering free rides away from the scene of a large scale crime. In a situation like that, speaking with the police about what was witnessed and requesting a ride from police or other authorities would have been the smart play... unfortunately a lot of the concert goers were young, naive, and in severe shock so they were likely not thinking clearly. Predators will always take advantage of prey when prey is in a weakened state. Given that the UK is a massive surveillance state however, I refuse to believe there&#39;s no CCTV evidence of these peoples whereabouts following the event.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Perhaps they&#39;re being/were being held ransom and their numbers dropping as the government refuses to give into their demands.  We would probably not be told about that and an automated clampdown on the internet could possibly help seal it.  Funny, because I saw the front pages of the papers in the shops today and did think &quot;how the hell are they &#39;missing&#39;?&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pure coincidence most likely, but we shouldn&#39;t act like it&#39;s so unconscionable to suggest that the cab drivers could have done this  when the infrastructure is clearly in place for this based on neighboring rotherham. How often are people still missing this long after a terror attack? I&#39;d imagine the families are swarming the hospitals too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Picture yourself as a pious and obedient Muslim who sees prophet Mohammed as the maximum expression of human goodness and what all should aspire to be. </p>

<p>Driving a taxi around Manchester, you happen to pick up a young, distressed little girl who is in shock because of a terrorist attack. Deep down (and because of your teachings) you know this type of things don&#39;t happen to pious Muslims like you (because it hasn&#39;t happened to you), and it&#39;s pretty obvious this young lady comes comes from a place of debauchery and sin (which is the reason why God punishes them with explosions), so you do what every pious Muslim who has seen the light will benevolenty  do by mirroring the actions of your prophet by making this young lady a wife within Islam, at the ripe age of 9, just like the prophet would have it. </p>

<p>Multiculturalism at its finest </p>
