<p>I urge you to read Jason Stanley&#39;s book titled How Propaganda Works.  The title makes it sound like a breezy overview. It&#39;s not. He&#39;s a philosopher and this book is deep, dead on, and readable (no overuse of philosophical jargon).  He answers this question in numerous ways. </p>

<p>Jason Stanley&#39;s book titled How Propaganda Works.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Great recommendation. A pertinent quote seeing how we are in a communicative space.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Propaganda poses an equally obvious threat to the epistemic
conception of democracy, championed by the philosopher
David Estlund and the political scientist Hélène Landemore.13
Epistemic democrats hold that democracy should be given an
epistemic justification (perhaps in addition to its autonomyrelated
justification), one that rests upon the superiority of
collective reasoning for deciding outcomes. On this view, democracy
is the best form of government, because collective
deliberation followed by majority rule is the most reliable way
to make decisions. Propaganda poses an obvious problem for
the epistemic conception of democracy, because propaganda
bypasses rational deliberation</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because it&#39;s a junk lawsuit filed just to make conservative headlines. The real conspiracy here is why they are trying so hard to destroy the democratic party, and turn our country into a one-party system. This should alarm everyone, regardless of their political affiliations.</p>

<p>The lawyer who filed this lawsuit posts links to the Daily Caller, for fucks sake. And yet he claims to run a &quot;progressive&quot; SuperPAC, but a lot of what he posts seems to only serve to undermine a progressive agenda.</p>

<p>At best, this guy&#39;s motivations appear to be to further his own image, not care for the democratic process. </p>

<p>And they did report on it, just now how many people like it here. It&#39;s not a blackout, just because you disagree with the perceived bias. They mentioned it <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/05/20/the-seth-rich-conspiracy-shows-how-fake-news-still-works/">here.</a></p>

<p>Furthermore, all of this is attached the Seth Rich stuff, and the lawyer pushing these lawsuits tweets things like</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m a progressive and I oppose this vigorously! Keep going Sean! #SethRich was a Berner and we want #justiceforseth!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In response the Hannity boycott. What progressive in their right mind would not want Hannity to be boycotted? (Assuming they are, you know, actually a progressive.) Suspicious as fuck. Not to mention RT Is propping him up.</p>

<p>Perhaps this guy is your man, but the fact of the matter is he shouldn&#39;t be, if he was really progressive.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Junk lawsuit? There is real evidence that the DNC colluded with major media outlets to rig their primary election while telling their constituents it was a democratic process and taking campaign money from them.</p>

<p>Their legal defense is that they are allowed to lie and defraud their own voter base because it&#39;s no different than &quot;campaign promises&quot;. If I were still deluded enough to buy into democratic socialism I would frothing at the mouth calling for them to hung for treason for subverting democracy.</p>

Gee, I wonder if there&#39;s a common sense reason for that. Nope, must be shilling.

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly this. This is the whole reason I care about any of this shit. I want to see the GOP burn for what they did in 2012. Unfortunately, the evidence didn&#39;t come out for what happened in 2012, but it did when the DNC did it in 2016, so we can start by holding them accountable. Maybe it will prevent either party from doing it in the future, but I doubt it.</p>

<p>If you read my reply, you&#39;d see that&#39;s not the case. </p>

<p>You should probably take a look at that full lawsuit. It&#39;s so dumb, there&#39;s no way they will win. Almost, as if that&#39;s on purpose. Because they know they couldn&#39;t build a real case. E.g If you read the bit in the article I posted:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Among the finer points of the lawsuit is that it seeks damages against the DNC for allowing itself to be hacked.</p>

<p>This is all just political theater.</p>

<p>You might want to work on your reading comprehension. I wasn&#39;t calling you a shill, I was sarcastically commenting on how ridiculous it is that you assume that someone must be shilling for political purposes to sue the DNC over what happened with Bernie.</p>

<p>This is a political scandal and your only reason for discounting it is that the proponents of the lawsuit are suddenly not very friendly with the DNC? Gee, I wonder if there&#39;s a common sense reason for <strong>that.</strong> Nope, must be shilling. There&#39;s no way in hell if this came out as being done by the GOP the media would act like it&#39;s all partisan BS not to be taken seriously.</p>

<p>You never specified whether &quot;that&quot; was referring to my discounting it, or your dumbed down conception of my understanding of the issue. </p>

<p>I never used the term &quot;shill&quot; before I perceived you calling me one. The fact that you even use the term, probably means your not really worth my time. You made this conversation 100x stupider the second you used the term. You assume that I speak of self-aware operatives that aren&#39;t themselves being manipulated, for example. And ignored the alternative theories I provided only to focus on the one version that fit into a label you understood. And maybe you aren&#39;t aware of it because you&#39;ve been trained to think this way, but it is both manipulative of others, and yourself to use labels in this way to divert real discussion. </p>

<p>Jesus Christ. It&#39;s called a rhetorical device. I made a sarcastic comment to make light of how overly simplistic and biased your reasoning was. Doing so necessarily is going to oversimplify your point. I&#39;m well aware that what you&#39;re implying doesn&#39;t automatically equate to shilling, but it easily can be interpreted as implying it.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The way you were labeling and describing the actions and motives of the person pursuing the lawsuit heavily implied it. Don&#39;t pretend you&#39;re on moral high ground just because you didn&#39;t use the actual word.</p>

<p>After a self-righteous post insulting my intelligence you claim that I am the one diverting real discussion. I&#39;m done with you and this conversation.</p>

<p>Unless you have evidence of vote manipulation, I think you&#39;d have a hard time using that word in court. On top of that, a shitload of the money Clinton raised was to be available to whomever won the Democratic primary. Sanders only raised money for his campaign.</p>

<p>That&#39;s the initial dismissal motion. Everybody always has those. you find a technicality to dismiss the lawsuit, so you don&#39;t have to go to trial, which is massively expensive even when you win.</p>

<p>Realistically, even if the plaintiffs get past this motion, they&#39;ll have a massive burden of proof on their hands. Do you separate the actions of individual people from the organization as a whole? What if those people merely discussed things in emails, but didn&#39;t implement them? What if they did, and they say that they were merely testing a candidate before the general election, so they could get ahead of anything?</p>

<p>You not only have to prove actions, you have to prove intent. This lawsuit is going nowhere.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>People are so loyal to these parties, who by their own admission, are loyal to no one. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>To be fair, the DNC did support the more popular candidate. Let&#39;s be honest here, there&#39;s a reason Clinton won by such a large margin. Before 2015, nobody outside VT knew who Sanders was.</p>

<p>The worst part is that they&#39;re right. The DNC doesn&#39;t owe anything to anyone besides its financiers. They&#39;re not some public group that is required by law to give equal treatment to all candidates who come through the democratic primaries. </p>
