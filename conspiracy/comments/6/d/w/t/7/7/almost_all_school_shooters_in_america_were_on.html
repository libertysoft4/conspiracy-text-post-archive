    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s possible that in some cases the medicine does have adverse effects, the way these kinds of medications work is delicate and requires follow up and communication with trained professionals. </p>

<p>For people who don&#39;t have access to effective/consistent treatment, abuse their medication, or try to stop taking it all together abruptly there is a high probability of worsening symptoms. </p>

<p>But that&#39;s not the medication causing it in the sense of the medicine being at fault, it&#39;s the medicine not being utilized correctly.</p>

<p>More often then not violent/psychotic outbursts are caused when patients go off of their medications because they feel like they don&#39;t need them anymore when they are actually serving as an important stabilizer for their extreme tendencies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This... Isn&#39;t quite accurate. If you&#39;re suicidal, but also don&#39;t have enough energy to follow through, the medication sometimes &quot;cures&quot; the energy more quickly than the &quot;suicidal thoughts&quot; symptoms. In that period you may be more likely to have enough energy to go through with killing yourself, which is why *good* doctors watch patients very closely during this period</p>

<p>Drs are so quick to over prescribe and guilt their parents into using the medicine if they want to considered a good parent.  Zoloft has some horrible withdrawals and I&#39;m sure other antidepressants does as well.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was on psych meds when i was in high school for  few months, and when i quit cold turkey my brain felt like it was on fire. I have never felt so dissociated, psychopathic, and unstable before in my life. It felt like i&#39;d been doing some dirty speed and not sleeping for a few days, my brain just was burning and going 100mph, became very unhinged and on edge I can definitely see the correlation of kids quitting their psych meds cold turkey and doing violent acts. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if this was the case for a few shootings.
Even when i experimented one time with a larger dose of my SSRI&#39;s, i had to be sent home from school, because i felt like i was out of my body.
I can&#39;t stress how odd it was quitting cold turkey, and i even have another friend who did the same thing and he also related to me his experience of going batshit crazy from quitting, having a similar brain on fire experience. </p>

<p>I would say mental illness is the foundation for these incidents, but psych meds can definitely act as a catalyst for one to become even more psychotic in some cases. The way these psych meds are prescribed so easily is evil in my opinion, and is silently ruining a lot of peoples lives.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah..........WT actual F?</p>

<p>Given how liberal the US medical system is with its prescribing and dispensing of opiates, anti-psychotics, anti-depressants and anxiolytics (benzodiazepines) this is startling.</p>

<p>Benzos have been reported to be far harder to quit than opiates, alcohol, methamphetamine and tobacco and reach addiction potential at a mere 6 weeks.....</p>

<p>For a drug that is dispensed so freely in such a medicated society the level of unawareness re its addictive potential is incredibly inept in that the &quot;health authorities&quot; should be educating people about the associated risks of prolonged use. Actually this is r/consp. of course they wouldn&#39;t.</p>

<p>I mean look at how weed is considered there both by normies and the &quot;health authorities&quot; generally. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was thinking about this recently. If we know to some extent how different chemicals can affect the brain in regards to depression/anxiety/paranoia/etc. Would it be safe to assume that a pill could be engineered to actually increase these symptoms instead of reduce them? And if so, how hard would it be to get those pills into the hands of someone that is already seeking treatment for such issues? Especially if they looked identical to legitimate medications. Couple that with how easy it is to target individuals with very specific advertising, (introducing different types of media to a person that might influence their beliefs) and It would seem not too far fetched that an organization with adequate resources could increase the number of shootings quite effectively. I believe that there are several people/organizations that could potentially benefit from the aftermath of these shootings. Both anti-gun advocates as well as the arms manufactures that profit from increased sales every time people begin to panic that their 2nd  ammendment rights will soon be taken away. </p>

I&#39;m in my 40s. I am normally a very nice person (look through my posts). But while I was taking Adderal, I became a very angry person. I actually picked verbal fights with people! (And if you know me in real life, you would know this is not me at all!) I eventually put 2+ 2 together and realized it was the medication. I stopped taking it immediately.

    <div class="md"><p>Does this take into account the school shootings by black teenagers? I doubt it. Because they label it as gang violence and don&#39;t cover it. Most school shooters are not white kids on dope. Sorry</p>

<p>Black teenagers ate 13 times more likely to suffer from gun violence during primary years.</p>

<p>Because the agenda of the left isn&#39;t to look into the failing mental health of many people in America. It&#39;s to try and take away and limit the right to exercise your 2nd amendment rights as an American citizen. </p>

I&#39;ve been on several medications all my life for my disorders ever since I was a young child, and from my experience I can say that my medications have never been monitored enough as they should of. Medication is vital for people with illnesses regardless, but the direction pharmacies in America are taking it is only about money. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>IIRC on SSRIs big swings in medication (stopping, starting, etc.) is associated with violence, especially in adolescents. In fact there is some evidence that less violent people are more affected. Supposedly using tapering (in- or decreasing dosage slowly) should prevent this from occurring.

    <div class="md"><p>We pretty much know absolutely nothing at all about the brain. we have some evidence that certain chemicals in certain people may be related to certain illnesses. We have some broad range medications which are almost no longer prescribed ( xanax, and vallium come to mind. ) which simply work on completely unrelated areas. </p>

<p>but even if you ask the most up to date expert in neuro-chemistry or any related field as to why a SSRI works ( or why it dosnt work in some people. ) you will always get a vague answer.  </p>
