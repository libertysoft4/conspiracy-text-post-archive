<p>Do you deny that any of the other 44 presidents in our histort could have also been undermined and unseated given the same scrutiny? </p>

<p>When our elected officials are subject to political hitjobs by the unelected then we aren&#39;t a Republic any more. When our elected officials can be blackmailed and held hostage or be subjected to political witch hunts if they don&#39;t tow the line is when America isn&#39;t America any more.</p>

Let&#39;s look at WHY he has a special counsel.<br/>
1.  He fired Comey and said Russia was on his mind when he did it.<br/>
2.  His comms department threw Rosenstein under the bus implying it was him who initiated the firing.<br/>
3.  Rosenstein not wanting to be implicated (because he knew Trump was firing Comey before he sent the memo they were going to use as justification) assigned a special counsel.    </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Point 1. is way out of context.</p>

<p>Trump says something like he doesn&#39;t like that Comey went along with the Russia narrative since it was made up by the DNC. Also at this point it is clear that Comey wasn&#39;t investigating Trump for Russian collusion considering he explicitly said that in the firing letter and Comey has yet to deny it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is about people close to Trump potentially committing crimes.  You should be in favor of those people being caught for possibly trying to manipulate the POTUS and undermine his Presidency and so should he.<br/>
Instead, he&#39;s used to getting his way with everything like in his businesses so he asked them to stop the investigation which is a no no.  Then he fired the person who wanted to impartially investigate.   It just doesn&#39;t look good at all.  It&#39;s why we&#39;re where we are at with a special counsel.    </p>

<p>Yes, the rabid onslaught of hysteria by the corporate media to influence and sway the populace, the politically motivated leakings of classified information by Obama administration officials, and the McCarthy era style of creating fear of Russians and the appearance of even being seen talking to a Russian means you <em>may</em> be a spy or treasonous definitely isn&#39;t a silent fucking coup! Open your damn eyes. Checks and balances my ass.</p>

<p>So when Obama&#39;s Attorney General Eric Holder lied to Congress and admitted presenting false evidence to Congress and was held in CONTEMPT by Congress, that&#39;s nothing campared to &quot;OMG! Sessions spoke to the Russian ambassador twice in his capacity as a Senator! OMG! Treason!&quot;</p>

<p>Or when Obama drone killed an American without due process? But wait, Kushner was talking to Russians! 😱</p>

<p>Not true.</p>

<p>Everyone wanted Comey fired—including Hillary Clinton—until it turned politically gainful not to.</p>

<p>The justification to investigate a crime is evidence of a crime. There isn&#39;t evidence of a crime. You are mixing your narratives up.</p>

<p>What recent two year long FBI investigation involved people invoking the 5th Amendment and the Justice Department handing out immunity deals? </p>

<p>Right, the Hillary Clinton email investigation. Who went to jail? No one. But wait, using your logic if there is an investigation and people invoke the 5th Amendment that means a crime has actually been committed and there&#39;s evidence.</p>

<p>If I were you I would cite Nixon&#39;s collusion  with N. Vietnam to stop the Peace Talks, now on record.  </p>

<p>The Reagan election team for colluding with Iran to continue to hold the hostages, </p>

<p>And what looks like evidence of the W. Bush Administration collusion with Israel and the Saudis for 9/11.  (Note these nations are both allies, so they were not colluding with enemy nations.)<br/>
Yes they all should have been punished, only Nixon was and for another reason, that reason was covering up the burglary of the Democratic Party&#39;s Office in the Watergate building and the recording where he requested that the IRS be used to harm his political opponents.  </p>

<p>This Adm seems to have colluded with a nation that is openly hostile to the U.S. both for election meddling, (Russia did meddle) no proof given yet about actual collusion but the back door communications is shocking and un-precedented.</p>

<p>Russia is not an ally they are actively hostile to U.S. and our EU allies.   </p>

<p>You can keep thinking it is all a witch hunt and what wil you think if it is proven that they were intending to work together against U.S. interests and against our current allies, while not advising the U.S. Citizens.  </p>

<p>Are you actually approving the Russian interference in the election,(an evidenced based fact)  and the planned secret cooperation? </p>

<p>1876 -- Republicans lost both the popular vote and electoral vote, but set up a scheme to steal the White House -- and succeeded. The people did not like it and brought the former incumbent back in 1880.</p>

<p>1896 -- Republicans and Oligarchs joined together to illegally and secretly fund a coup. This time, they threatened workers and literally <em>watched</em> them vote under threat of unemployment -- and succeeded.</p>

<p>1933 -- Oligarchs planned to send 500,000 men to remove popularly elected Democratic president Franklin D. Roosevelt. Traitor to the traitors, General Smedley Butler exposed the scheme. Coup failed.</p>

<p>1968 -- Republicans secretly negotiated with North Vietnam to sabotage peace process. Richard Nixon elected. Coup succeeded. (Not to mention the assassination of Robert Kennedy in June.)</p>

<p>1972 -- Republican operatives and Watergate. Coup succeeded.</p>

<p>1980 -- Republican VP candidate George Bush made a secret deal with hostage holding Iran to keep the hostages until after the election. Coup succeeded. Incredibly, hostages were released within minutes of Reagan inauguration.</p>

<p>2000 -- Republican partisan Supreme Court voted 5-4 to override state law and stop a the vote count, declaring George W. Bush president. Coup succeeded.</p>

<p>2004 -- Republican operatives gamed election in both Ohio and Florida, stealing both states. Coup succeeded.</p>

<p>2016 -- Republican operatives illegally purged voter lists and took full advantage of 5-4 Supreme Court coup against voting rights act. Coup succeeded.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Kennedy? That&#39;s it? That&#39;s all you got?</p>

<p>Richard Nixon pursued recounts. After early tests, Republicans did not like the results, so they had to swallow the loss. So that was another attempt by Republicans at a &quot;secret coup.&quot; That one failed ...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>GOP leaders had reason to conduct even a doomed campaign. Even if they ultimately lost, they reasoned, they could still taint Kennedy&#39;s victory. They could claim he had no mandate, galvanize their rank and file and build a winning issue for upcoming elections.</p>

<p>But then, JFK was assassinated -- arguably the top conspiracy ever discussed here. Some thought that VP Lyndon Johnson would be more willing to support the oligarchs, as he was a southerner from Texas and had once campaigned for segregation. Whoops, they were wrong. Turns out Johnson carried out the economic and social agenda of Kennedy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s two more:</p>

<p>In 1868, Republicans impeached Democrat Andrew Johnson for refusing to apply a law. He was almost removed. Later, the Supreme Court determined that Andrew Johnson was correct and the Republicans were wrong.</p>

<p>In 1998, after years of investigating under an &quot;independent counsel&quot; law, Republican Kenneth Starr finally found a reason to impeach Democrat Bill Clinton -- lying about a blow job. Knowing they did not have the vote count for removal, they impeached him anyway for a political propaganda &quot;silent coup.&quot; After Bill Clinton was not removed, the Supreme Court declared the law permitting Kenneth Starr to investigate to be unconstitutional.</p>
