    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I was thinking that people express they feel a certain way or have some natural response to an unnatural situation like anxiety in our society, and they become pathologized by professionals who prescribe medications that damage the brain and body, and as a result we label their worsening symptoms as a progressive mental illness like Bipolar Disorder or Schizophrenia. I mean we give Ritalin to kids at a young age for being bored or hyper, and then wonder why we have so many people in society who are addicted to crack or meth.</p>

Sigmund Freud, the Jew, invented a whole new school of thought that facilitated our modern understanding of mental illness.

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Treating Mental Illnesses6</p>

<p>At this time, most mental illnesses cannot be cured, but they can usually be treated effectively to minimize the symptoms and allow the individual to function in work, school, or social environments. To begin treatment, an individual needs to see a qualified mental health professional. The first thing that the doctor or other mental health professional will do is speak with the individual to find out more about his or her symptoms, how long the symptoms have lasted, and how the person&#39;s life is being affected. The physician will also do a physical examination to determine whether there are other health problems. For example, some symptoms (such as emotional swings) can be caused by neurological or hormonal problems associated with chronic illnesses such as heart disease, or they can be a side effect of certain medications. After the individual&#39;s overall health is evaluated and the condition diagnosed, the doctor will develop a treatment plan. Treatment can involve both medications and psychotherapy, depending on the disease and its severity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I appreciate the attempt at reasonable discussion, it&#39;s a shame that not everyone is capable of contributing in a positive manner. Personally I think that the problem stems from our medical system as a whole. It seeks to treat rather than cure or prevent. The management of illness and symptoms, doesn&#39;t address the root issues causing them, and is more likely to be used for exploitative reasons. Again, I think it mostly is caused by immediate gratification as opposed to commitment and responsibility. When we are in pain, we usually just want a pain killer, we don&#39;t want to hear how we shouldn&#39;t sit around on the couch for 40 hours a week and waste away while eating potato chips and drinking diet cola. Id even argue though, that if someone wanted to be in the best shape they could be in, they may not always have the ability to achieve it due to external reasons, and this limits them. Maybe, in this example, potato chips and diet cola is all the food they can afford to buy. Maybe they spend their money on their sick mother, who needs a hip replacement. Maybe they work 3 full time jobs, etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think people just want their way of perceiving the world to be the only right way, which Imo is the definition of mental illness (not the DSM). People don&#39;t want to change and grow, they just want to be right and comfortable.

    <div class="md"><p>Well as someone that&#39;s had mental illnesses passed down generation to generation and is also currently dating someone with borderline personality disorder among other things, I believe that people with mental illness have no control over that and that there are chemical imbalances in our brains that cause these illnesses and disorders. I also believe that people that take medications such as Zoloft, Prozac, and countless other medications can be permanently affected by these medications. These medicines try to bridge the gaps in our brains to try to change the imbalances that we face. When taken off of these medicines, however, it can lead to a change for either the better or for the worse. I suffer from acute anxiety and chronic depression and have for years and was only recently prescribed Zoloft back in November following a traumatic event. I ran out of the medication and was unable to get a refill at the time and my friend pointed out to me that there was an obvious difference between how I was on it and off it. I believe that we can sort of become dependent on these medicines and that they change us but I don&#39;t believe that they are the sole cause of mental disorders. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wonder too how common what we consider mental illness today was in the past, like during Jesus&#39; time or the dark ages. I think despite all the hardships people had back then, they would of been much more connected to their communities and spiritually, that they probably didn&#39;t experience as many negative states as us. I think the biggest cause other than drugs being prescribed to treat false conditions is that we live in a society in which we are powerless to effect anything and our contributions are becoming far more detached. At least in the past if you fixed someones shoes or chopped wood, you could see the effect that brought to people and the community around you. Today, not so much. If you buy something, it was probably made by 50 other people in 50 different countries.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll bite. I suffer from depression and anxiety/agoraphobia (passed on most likely from my mother and grandmother, I have dug into my family&#39;s history and it&#39;s there). Around the age of 13 I began taking Zoloft. Around the age of 18 I stopped taking Zoloft because I was done with it. A few months later I became sick as a dog, waking up in cold sweats, terrible brainzaps and the kicker (I developed O.C.D.) I was more or less forced to go back on Zoloft to live my life. I now suffer from all these things but am working on helped ease the symptoms. It&#39;s pretty much confirmed that some sort of mental illness was passed on from my mother (bless her heart) and my grandmother on my father&#39;s side.

<p>Sure, some psychological &quot;disorders&quot; are merely symptoms of a different problem. Some conditions classified as a disorder I believe are simply a neural network that has taken a different direction of evolution.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, for sure. I mean he practically converted all of our understanding into some pseudo-religion for the 20th century. The problem with that is, you now have a bunch of people who were taught that is the truth because Sigmund says so, and bam! we have a collective delusion. I think the reason why so many people, especially in the West, refuse to accept Christianity, is because they are afraid to look within themselves and accept that they may have to make a change because their thinking is flawed. It&#39;s so much easier to blame others, and project our failures onto others. It&#39;s also a whole lot more convenient for people to have instant gratification with things like abortions, than it is to deal with the commitment and responsibility of raising a child for example. How is abortion any different than murder? Yet some people believe they should be able to do it no matter what, whenever they want, for whatever reasons and at any time. I guess we&#39;ve just redefined and normalized child sacrifice into something that socially acceptable. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure, I see what you&#39;re getting at, but I would argue that if we got the proper amount of nutrition from real foods, and not foods that contain chemicals that alter our bodies chemistries and endocrines, we might be a whole lot healthier. I think a large component of what makes people ill today, is that they are way too stressed, and bombarded by stupid things like advertisements, political agendas, and just how we compartmentalize everything. Im sure you could say anyone who doesn&#39;t support your political ideas, or religious ideas is a schizophrenic. Most illnesses have a blood test or some physical evidence that there is a disruption in the bodies functioning, like the heart stops, but what does schizophrenia or other mental illnesses have? Nothing, its a subjective interpretation done by a psychiatrist who is educated by the same system that profits from the dependency of individuals on chemical drugs. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s cute.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s what I learned...there are those who have true chemical imbalances. You can see an absolute marked change in their behavior and actions. The <em>right</em> medicine for the <em>right</em> affliction. That&#39;s the catch. Sadly, because of how difficult it is to diagnose someone due to the intricacies of emotions, the capability to lie or exaggerate symptoms, etc..the wrong meds can be given, and the person believes they have the wrong diagnosis.</p>

<p>I&#39;m glad you think a god of any type can be perfect and create unflawed human beings, good for you. Science had proven DNA to be tricky and not so perfect, unfortunately. Be it environmental or physical, many defects can happen while the fetus is created. </p>

<p>I hope you don&#39;t believe that those with depression, suicidal thoughts, violent tendencies and other afflictions are &quot;perfect&quot; the way they are. How many news stories about vets with PTSD do we need to read? Of someone who &quot;snaps&quot;? Would you be forgiving of such a person if they take away someone you love? Because they are &quot;perfect&quot; the way they are? Do you believe in therapy without the use of drugs?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think OP has some points worth discussing, depression is a good example, in that the causes could be a myriad of things from social standing, health, wealth, memory, aspirations, the cause could itself just be the life you are living or a delusion of self even. </p>

<p>My point being to medicate a person to alleviate symptoms that arise purely from modern life is extremely dangerous and a precedent i think many people can see as almost a plan to keep the slave slaving.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think mental illness as we know it has existed for much longer than the pharmaceutical companies have. Sigmund Freud, the Jew, invented a whole new school of thought that facilitated our modern understanding of mental illness. In my opinion this was a deliberate thing to undermine Western society and culture. Same thing with the Frankfurt school. Same thing with Marxism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, for sure. I mean he practically converted all of our understanding into some pseudo-religion for the 20th century. The problem with that is, you now have a bunch of people who were taught that is the truth because Sigmund says so, and bam! we have a collective delusion. I think the reason why so many people, especially in the West, refuse to accept Christianity, is because they are afraid to look within themselves and accept that they may have to make a change because their thinking is flawed. It&#39;s so much easier to blame others, and project our failures onto others. It&#39;s also a whole lot more convenient for people to have instant gratification with things like abortions, than it is to deal with the commitment and responsibility of raising a child for example. How is abortion any different than murder? Yet some people believe they should be able to do it no matter what, whenever they want, for whatever reasons and at any time. I guess we&#39;ve just redefined and normalized child sacrifice into something that socially acceptable. </p>
