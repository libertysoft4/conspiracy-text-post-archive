        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I have an entry from early this year which I am certain never occurred. My phone says I traveled 63 floors and took 101,554 steps in exactly 6 minutes between 12:28:44 AM and 12:34:44 AM.. I have a job that requires me to be up early and the night in question was a Sunday, I was for sure in bed because that weekend was a busy one and memories were made to say the least. I can&#39;t find anything online about malfunctions like this. I&#39;m trying to be rational..Anyone?! </p>

<p>Edit: I&#39;ll add that I have what options I can turned off for motion tracking and gps. I do however use the bedtime option on the clock app on iPhone which pulls from the device and sends it to Health.. the only options for disabling them are for access to other apps not the data collection itself. That&#39;s where I found this info. I took screenshots and will post when I get to my laptop to blur my info. </p>

<p>Edit2: Screenshots &gt;<a href="http://imgur.com/a/J0hsV">Here</a>&lt; Even weirder are the dates added, most of them are added later, some like this one even days, why does the data just sit? Does it go anywhere or do anything proir to being &#39;added&#39;?</p>

<p>Edit3: Chatted with an apple tech and the most like explanation is a bug in the borometer sending data to the Health app. Idk I call some smelly bullshit on this one guys, the borometer measures air pressure to determine how high you are and then convert that into an amount of flights climbed when combined with step count, I get it. But that means that my phone detected air pressure changed equivilent to climbing that high in 6 minutes. I find it really hard to believe bugs in a borometer would be that bad but who knows. For now I&#39;ve turned off ALL motion and fitness tracking as I&#39;m sketched out fully. If I find anythiong else interesting on the subject I&#39;ll update, maybe someone will find this post a few years from now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The odds of a random glitch being exactly 6 minutes is astronomical. The floors (63) doesn&#39;t seem to be very round, and the steps (101,554) dont either. This indicates that your movement wasn&#39;t designed to be windowed in any special way... but the TIME was. Whatever happened needed to happen like clockwork....</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t program the app, but a race condition scenario could look like this(in psuedocode):</p>

<p>As intended: trip leg reset, begin trip count, persist trip leg.</p>

<p>Race condition:  begin trip count, persist trip leg, trip leg reset.</p>

<p>More likely, it&#39;s a concurrency issue with static variables throughout the code.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been a programmer for 15 years and that is the most incoherent description of a race condition I&#39;ve ever heard. A race condition would require the incrementing of metrics like steps and distance in some perverse anti-pattern loop racing against an end condition which already beat it and is no longer going to trigger the ending of the incrementing process. Unless this software is an entry in obfuscated C contest I cannot fathom any step counter working in this manner. The way any pedometer works is based on hardware events and simple addition, not endless loops that if they miss their end condition continue adding steps as a function of time until the next end condition triggers.</p>

<p>A concurrency issue with static variables?  What variables do you imagine are static and how do you imagine those variables being thread locked results in the rampant incrementing of those variables? If it&#39;s locked there is no incrementing, and further there is no read action on variables like distance traveled to perform further calculations. Whatever static variables you&#39;ve imagined are far more likely instanced in any model and even if they weren&#39;t it&#39;s still an entirely incoherent fictional debugging of the issue.</p>

<p>Again what we see here is the curt dismissal of a very serious issue through a reckless throwing around of technical jargon. I suggest everyone in this thread tag demos74dx in RES as a potential cover up agent. Obviously we don&#39;t want to assume and we want to be as skeptical as possible, but it&#39;s looking very likely. At the very least we can say with authority that you don&#39;t want demos74dx debugging your app.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>about 100k &quot;steps&quot; in 6 minutes? That&#39;s 277 per minute. I think it&#39;s safe to say that no matter how wildly this guy was jerking off, or even how bad a seizure was, this is still at least an order of magnitude too fast.</p>

<p>The only possible way for a human to take 100k steps in 6 minutes is that they can&#39;t. It had to have been more than 6 minutes, but the clock only <em>recognized</em> that 6 minutes had passed from earths temporal frame of reference. If he were to have been, say, travelling in a reference frame other than earth at speeds approaching C, well... that would solve that problem...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I actually did do a little bit of looking into the amount of movement in a seizure to establish if this was possible. Although it is a ton in a grand mal, it still doesn&#39;t come close to what this is.</p>

<p>To put it in perspective, a human body moving at 277 &quot;steps&quot; per second (aka 277 Hz), would actually produce an audible tone. That&#39;s right, in the same way that a guitar string plays a note, a human body would make one too. It&#39;s easily within our audible spectrum too.</p>

<p>IN FACT, 277 Hz isn&#39;t just a random tone, it&#39;s a known healing tone used by Tibetane monks... <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHIolptFBGw">Listen here</a></p>

<p>If you ever hear a human being vibrating so hard that they make this sound, it&#39;s a much bigger deal than simply a seizure.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>277 PER MINUTE. That&#39;s only 5 twitches per second. Given that all your muscles are twitching in different directions at the same time this seems possible it would register that way. I&#39;ve personally witnessed upwards of 10 grand mal seizures. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>100,000 steps / 6 min = 16,666 steps / min = 277 steps / <strong>second</strong>.</p>

<p>If this was 277 per MINUTE then yeah, I&#39;d be on board with you as this being possible... but that&#39;s not what happened here.</p>
