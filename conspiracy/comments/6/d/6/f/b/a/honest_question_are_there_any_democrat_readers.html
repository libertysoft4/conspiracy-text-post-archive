    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not a registered Democrat, but besides not voting for Hillary (I went Green) I&#39;ve pretty much almost always voted Democrat in other elections. I also hate the alt-right, and while it is mostly alt-right publications that are talking about this story, I am not one to shoot the messenger, even when the messenger is a racist asshole.</p>

<p>More importantly, this entire Seth Rich affair is so suspicious. I mean, it&#39;s the only unsolved murder of a political employee on the streets of Washington DC in <strong>years</strong> and we&#39;re all supposed to not ask questions? The 2-3 hours missing from his night, the fact that he was alive and speaking when police found him but dead by the time his family got to the hospital, the fact that nothing was stolen from him, the fact that his laptop has disappeared when it should not have even entered police hands if this was just a mere mugging gone wrong, and the fact that nobody has been allowed to see the video of the killing, when it apparently exists since the police described to the parents that they had seen a video and that&#39;s where a lot of the clues even came from, and yet nobody, not even the parents, have seen this security camera footage. </p>

<p>Not to mention it was during the height of election season, the fact that he isn&#39;t even the only DNC staffer to die mysteriously during that time. Something smells rotten as hell. I think it all goes higher than Clinton though, she&#39;s just a stooge, I don&#39;t think she&#39;s a puppet master and neither is Bill. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That, to me shows that the idea of justice still lives and breathes (although labored) amongst some in the ranks. The fact that it&#39;s politicized is a side effect of politics. Both of your examples have real word implications that to fellow nobody&#39;s like you and I, would have to answer for. Same as Chiquita killing off indigenous tribes for profit margins. All actions have consequences,  when you&#39;re padded by a huge team,  muckraking is used as defense tactics. </p>

They work on mostly counterterrorism/organized crime/traffic etc.  I think they can also get involved in crimes if it crosses state borders, but as far as I know that is mostly RICO stuff.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There isn&#39;t anything there. The speculation that somehow Clinton was involved was started almost immediately.  Since then, almost every piece of evidence is shitty, but as long as enough people see it it becomes one of the facts in the &quot;case&quot;.  A lot of the arguments people use are pure fiction.  </p>

<p>In arguing this here, I get the same talking points.  A big one is that the Clintons have a &quot;history&quot; of killing people, and the examples I get are Shawn Lucas and Victor Thorn.  For this to be true, the ME had to be wrong in both cases.  The ME statement is taken as wrong without any reason to believe so.  And it doesn&#39;t even make sense for the Clintons to kill either.  Lucas was a process server - killing him serves no purpose.  Victor Thorn has been writing books against the Clintons for 10 years.  But no, they waited until the election to kill him.</p>

<p>There are also posts coming in non-stop that are intentionally misleading.  The whole thing where Seth was a bernie supporter and had the twitter pandas4bernie is unverified at best, and most things indicate that it isn&#39;t his account.  Yet that part of the narrative - that he was a hard core Bernie supporter and this is why he was sharing the leaks - is taken as fact.  Meanwhile, the fact that he had just taken a position in the Clinton campaign and was going to move to Clinton (which is verified by his parents) is ignored. </p>

<p>Seriously, go through any piece of evidence and give it scrutiny.  The whole thing is garbage.  How people don&#39;t see that this is being politicized is beyond me - the renewed interest in this story came from Fox news (who later retracted the story because the information in it was garbage).  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>All valid points.</p>

<p>I have a bias because i have read far too much about the Clintons and the US war-machine - i do think the Clinton&#39;s have the power to organize a killing and i do believe they have reasons.</p>

<p>There is just too much shady business going on - and too much misinformation for anyone to make a real assesnment. Sadly this only further enforces my ideologies because if these truly are just wild conspiracys then why are they being defended against so viciously. They are well aware that when left alone these theories will die out.</p>

<p>Anyway only time will tell my friend!</p>

<p>Instead of them concentrating on who could have had the means to commit the murder the police act like the could give two shits....</p>
