        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I hadn&#39;t taken a look at the Infowars main site in awhile, and god damn. It&#39;s become an extremist Huff Post that makes Breitbart look measured and soft. Anything conspiratorial in nature is assigned to various &quot;leftist&quot; causes and figures, as if they are the sole purveyors of high-level manipulation and evil in the country and world. It&#39;s very divisive stuff, comes off like a civil war bulletin of some kind. </p>

<p>This is not to say that the Washington Post or Mother Jones are not partisan to the level of frequent ignorance and insanity, neglecting to probe the issues that riddle the center-left with problems they fail to confront. Yet I always understood Infowars as a place that doesn&#39;t bow to money and power (Trump) or ignore high-level establishment conservative groups that share plenty of similarities with high-level liberal ones (Council for National Policy, for one). Any pretense of unbiased suspicion seems to have gone completely. Only one narrative is offered, like any other solid propaganda. </p>

<p>Jones, suspected inheritor of a John Birch Society legacy, would be right at home up there with Joe McCarthy and Roy Cohn, with Roger Stone (obviously) making fart sounds in the corner of the room. Oliver North lingers, Jerry Falwell and Focus on the Family. Not to mention Bannon, DeVos, Conway, Pence. The Mercers and Kochs are footing the bill. </p>

<p>Anyway, is Alex Jones CIA, and is Infowars (which apparently recently acquired WH press credentials) an intelligence and disinfo arm of Council for National Policy/the current US administration? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jesus, you&#39;re right. The invasion of the alternative media by useful dupes and shills have aligned Trump with us, somehow, as if he was much better than that Clinton cunt. What worries me is... I was a huge fan of Jones&#39; early docs and admit he <em>helped create</em> me. </p>

<p>He&#39;s currently worth about 4-8 million dollars. Was he lying the whole time? Maybe mixing truth with bullshit?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The general non-Jones devotee impression I get is that he mixes truth with fiction (if you buy the idea that Assange is at least partially owned by an outside party, it could fit with him too, mixing verified authentic leaked documents with unverified tweets and re-tweets). With Jones it&#39;s all the same format and difficult to parse apart. But when I see the exact same partisan concepts promoted there as you&#39;d find on gatewaypundit or zerohedge, it doesn&#39;t tell me he&#39;s offering any original knowledge, just re-enforcing an extant narrative. </p>

<p>The other thing you hear is that his easily-mockable screaming and ranting are there to discredit conspiracy theorists as legitimate minds, when I think it&#39;s a draw, it&#39;s a fuck-it wear your tinfoil proudly kind of thing. It&#39;s also entertaining and nihilistic considering the content. </p>

<p>I think he&#39;s kind of defined the conspiratorial mind for the 00&#39;s, but shaped it to think in an unquestioning partisan way. What the left is doing with Trump now has been what Jones has done with the powerful for years <em>until</em> Trump, and by proxy all who hitched a ride into power with him. Hell, Republicans have been openly using conspiratorial thinking to pass actual policy for decades (War on Drugs, Patriot Act, gutting the Voting Rights Act, the bathroom bills). Jones is a perfect mouthpiece no matter the topic. When Trump&#39;s Pence/Kobach-led Election Integrity Commission gets rolling I guarantee Infowars will push the millions of illegals voting thing. Everything has lined up pretty well so far.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What you fail to realize is that many people simply came to know that there was more to the world through Jones and that they then dug deeper. This argument has been made a million times and the bottom line is for however much bad Alex Jones may be repsonsible for in some people&#39;s eyes he woke people up who might have never woken up. In my opinion that&#39;s better than nothing, better than being asleep. Sure he avoids Israel but he talks about real shit too and if you&#39;re smart enough to discern you will get the knowledge out. I&#39;m sure he has people he answers to as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been aware of Alex Jones since like 2007 or 2008.  Infowars has changed a lot.  I dont really get your point though.  Liberals have dominated the media for decades so naturally they have to look elsewhere for people they can relate to... Who really enjoys watching Don Lemon &amp; Rachel Maddow vomit diarrhea for their mouth?  At least with alex jones you get to hear about psychic vampires.  I miss the days he was sneaking into Bohemian Grove.  There has been a conspiracy of the left to brainwash &amp; control people on college campuses &amp; through the media.  They are even turning on each other now.  No whites graduations.  Safe spaces from white people.  I&#39;d love to hear your thoughts on how the left got to this point?  Its very obvious that the brainwashing has backfired but then again maybe the goal was always radical left to create chaos.  MSNBC, CNN, etc... They wont show footage of white families walking into Trump rallies being beat &amp; spat on by Mexicans... What do you expect to happen when the Media has liberal agenda &amp; wont tell people the truth?  Its less what Alex Jones has done &amp; more about who MSM has neglected.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So let me get this straight, the liberals are guilty of brainwashing and propaganda, while the conservatives have been walking through the shit with clean hands? </p>

<p>When you talk about the &quot;MSM&quot; why do you not mention Fox News in that discussion? They were/are the most watched news channel for quite a while. They are inherently mainstream with that sort of viewership. Not sure if they&#39;ve lost the lead, but they&#39;re probably top 3, regardless. </p>

<p>As for AJ and infowars, what more can you really say about a guy admitted in a court of law that he&#39;s just playing a character on that show? I&#39;m not real sure where the line begins and ends with him, so I can&#39;t really trust much of anything he says. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely not and all my downvotes are clear proof of a continued narrative in this subreddit. Or perhaps that&#39;s tinfoil of me, and its just cognitive dissonance on behalf of a great sway of people who genuinely believe the current administration is somehow going to be different...by openly allowing corporations into political power. </p>

<p>In context to the comment I responded to, I&#39;m saying it&#39;s ridiculous to think the MSM narratives are mostly &quot;liberal&quot; or mostly &quot;conservative&quot;. </p>

<p>This is how they (MNC/Zionists/elite) have won. They have managed to convince the right/republicans/conservatives and the left/liberals/democrats are against each others way of life.</p>

<p>What I&#39;m saying is if you think the democrats (who are not left at all, not outside of the USA they aren&#39;t, you guys need to travel if you think for one second that the U.S. left is left) are the baddies, or the republicans (who are genuine right in economic terms, and are talking protectionist in rhetoric only and actions are economically very aligned with the democrats)  are the baddies, you have missed the whole point.</p>

<p>FTR, Obama didn&#39;t start any open source wars. The CIA under his administration clearly used military means as they created the Arab Spring and uprisings in Libya and Syria. Other than that, Yemen is the only country that is a &quot;new&quot; target for American presidential administrations.  But Obama didn&#39;t &quot;start&quot; the others (Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Somalia) he simply continued the status quo. It&#39;s almost as if he, as a Democrat, was playing from the same playbook as the Republican before him....</p>

<p>The game is natural resources (which equals money), the method is unchallenged military power, the team is the Zionist and American elite, the players (tools) are the CIA and the Presidential administrations. There&#39;s no sides that are better than the other, they are both just pawns.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Think whatever you want.  As a whole liberals have significant more control over colleges &amp; the media.  And if fox didnt promote a conservative position there would be literally NO MSM representing that side.  Liberals control every network except that one.  During the Bush admin Fox was guilty of these tactics... Now they give people like Julian Assange a voice.  But they also gave Megyn Kelly the venue to let Alefantis spread his lies without asking him one real question.  They are not innocent.

<p>However, it&#39;s my personal opinion that placing labels like conservative and liberal on people - then summarily disagreeing and/or hating the &quot;other&quot; side is one of the few sources of the problem. </p>

<p>Ultimately, we all want the same thing (I think) - to have a happy and successful life. There&#39;s a lot that goes in between the lines for that, sure. Either way, that&#39;s a damned good place to start having discussions. This whole conservative/liberal narrative is absolute bullshit, in my opinion, as it&#39;s really starting to divide friends, families, neighbors, and the nation. </p>

<p>Alex jones might steer his followers into a honey trap, I dont know. Maybe a manufactured civil war where they already have the upper hand. Whats even worse than this Donald trump was on Alex jones&#39;s show. This shows Donald wants to connect with the truther community. If Alex jones was being promoted by the media with negative press this actually makes people trust Alex jones. The media is useless and they already know this. Now they&#39;re targeting the internet and how it can be used to radicalize Americans.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea I don&#39;t really get all this shit. Are conspiracy theorists supposed to oppose everyone in government no matter what? Like no matter who ends up in a position of power, AJ is expected to oppose and criticize them? Finally someone who challenged the establishment not only has some power, but is fucking president - but we&#39;re supposed to mindlessly oppose him?</p>

<p>I wonder - what is it exactly that conspiracy theorists <strong>want</strong>? Trump was doing interviews with AJ well before the election. He&#39;s opposing the globalist agenda, he has given Infowars WH access. I don&#39;t like much of Trump&#39;s politics, I voted for him solely to challenge establishment power.</p>

<p>Look at the hysterics the MSM is going through to oppose Trump. Even Fox News&#39; coverage of Trump is mostly negative.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/byron-york-harvard-study-cnn-nbc-trump-coverage-93-percent-negative/article/2623641">http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/byron-york-harvard-study-cnn-nbc-trump-coverage-93-percent-negative/article/2623641</a></p>

<p>But hurr durr controlled opposition!</p>

<p>Here&#39;s my question: at what point do you accept that someone (who may not share your political views) is not an establishment shill?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump was always the establishment what the fuck are you taking about? Idiots that fall for this &quot;fighting for the common man&quot; shit are Trump and AJ&#39;s bread and butter, people like you believing this horseshit is what allows them to continue to exist. His press coverage being ass has less to do with all the media being shook that he&#39;s the man that&#39;s about to stand up for all the injustices and corruption of the world and more to do with the fact that he wouldn&#39;t play ball with them and just acts like a jackass in general; there is no fear from the establishment at all that Trump is going to blow the lid off at any moment, he&#39;s just another pawn; a useful idiot, you would be delusional to really think it&#39;s anything more at this point.</p>

<p>His job is to corral all the conspiracy theorists over over to the Right.  Why?  Ever hear the term Right-Wing Extremism?  They need to conflate conspiracy theory with Right-Wing Extremism, then at some point there will be an event (staged or otherwise), which will allow them to conflate Right-Wing Extremism with the War on Terror in General.  No more questioning.  </p>

<p>If you look at how most people on Reddit think of conspiracy theorists you can already see this - they seem to think all conspiracy theorists are part of the &quot;alt right.&quot;</p>

<p>That tells me that it wasn&#39;t an inside by the Bush administration, but, rather a Mossad job. Bush and his cronies knew about it before hand, but they were too incompetent to pull off 9-11. Jones always blames someone else when a conspiracy involves the Chosenites.</p>

Liberals did the same thing with Obama, the momentum for actual political power redistribution was there after W presidency and the economy collapse etc, but all that energy was channeled it to worship..... or hatred of Obama, the country is doing the exact same right now. For there to be a capable, constitutional reupublican, anti NWO, not owned by Globalism candidate for any federal political office, we the people are going to have to demand, fight and work for several election cycles to achieve this, Obama and Trump are pressure valves, pretend Populists, to keep the old political institutions from collapsing of political rot and corruption, but oh yeah Fuck Alex Jones, and to think 10 years ago I listened to Infowars! </p>

That being said, I like how willing they are to report on things no one else will, even though I admittedly deal with their right-leaning commentary. And even still, Alex is still the great gatekeeper. We can brainstorm up problems with Alex and his disposition, for sure, but we can also see how many people he&#39;s helped see what&#39;s really there.

    <div class="md"><p>I doubt he is CIA but it feels like Infowars are on a leash of some sort! They&#39;re soft on Israel and Zionism. Which I find suspicious. So in some sense you don&#39;t get the full picture.</p>

<p>In terms of there attack on the left I think it&#39;s justified for the most part because it&#39;s not just Infowars that can see what&#39;s developing. This neo-marxist Ideology is being implemented in schools and universities. Were seeing freedom of speech attacked. Gender and identity politics is being pushed by the establishment. Kids as young as four are experiencing lessons on gender neutrality. They&#39;re four years old ffs! Look at bill C16 that&#39;s just been past in Canada. It&#39;s now illegal to not call someone non-binary by there pro-noun. It&#39;s also now legislation that there is no relationship between the gender you&#39;re born with, the gender you indetify yourself to be, the gender you express yourself as and your sexual preference. This is going against all biological literature. I suggest you guys check out Dr. Jordan Peterson. He&#39;s been a one man army fighting this. One of the smartest guys on the planet for sure. </p>

<p>In my opinion this is a movement designed to dehumanise the public. Strip all indentity and sense of being away from the individual. As the public accept this through indoctrination, rolling out the AI integration of half human/AI  will become easier. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hmmmmm. Fair enough.</p>

<p>But what about neoliberalism over the last 30 years which saw a decade of prosperity and 2 decades of busts? Neoliberalism is a conservative government favourite yet we have seen it creates the biggest gap between the 1% elite and the rest of the world and we have seen that gap grow at the fastest rate in  history. </p>

<p>Gun control, safe spaces, gay rights, calkibgv peopke by gender correct names, etc is all white noise in my opinion. Where they really control us is through the economy, and the neoliberal ideology had destroyed the middle classes of most developed nations, whilst growing the profits of multinational corporations (elites). UN, IMF, WTO all propped up neoliberalism is the 80s (Reagonomics), why would they have an interest when we consider who they are?</p>

<p>Neoliberalism pushes small government, but I argue bigger government and more social services is actually better for the peoples quality of life. We get nothing from neoliberalism, except shittier lives than generations before us, yet the elites makes bulk cash because everything is privatised to make governments smaller.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The whole left vs right has become a little archaic. The political spectrum is bit broader than that. It is completely natural to have views that might land on either side. </p>

<p>If you think Alex Jones is the cause of so called &quot;hyper-partisan voter&quot; that blame everything on the left then you clearly don&#39;t watch anything from Alex Jones. He has been critical of the Trump administration, he is not afraid to call them out on their bullshit. </p>

<p>I think it&#39;s important to note that Alex Jones was very anti-Bush. He was also for Obama in the beginning of his presidency, but quickly turned against him as well. </p>

<p>But let&#39;s not forget the most important thing here, Alex Jones is a business man, he sells products and sells information. It is up to the people whether they choose to buy his shit, and purchase the information he is selling. </p>

<p>To blame someone for other people&#39;s beliefs is dumb, as adults one can form their own thoughts and opinions. You CHOOSE who influences your mind. </p>

I understand where he&#39;s coming from. Trump isn&#39;t perfect and has flaws, but I&#39;ll definitely support trump over the greater evil known as the deep state. At least Trump is anti-abortion, anti-tranny&#39;s in women&#39;s bathrooms, pro-gun, and is enforcing our border laws. That&#39;s more than what we got with Obama </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely not and all my downvotes are clear proof of a continued narrative in this subreddit. Or perhaps that&#39;s tinfoil of me, and its just cognitive dissonance on behalf of a great sway of people who genuinely believe the current administration is somehow going to be different...by openly allowing corporations into political power. </p>

<p>In context to the comment I responded to, I&#39;m saying it&#39;s ridiculous to think the MSM narratives are mostly &quot;liberal&quot; or mostly &quot;conservative&quot;. </p>

<p>This is how they (MNC/Zionists/elite) have won. They have managed to convince the right/republicans/conservatives and the left/liberals/democrats are against each others way of life.</p>

<p>What I&#39;m saying is if you think the democrats (who are not left at all, not outside of the USA they aren&#39;t, you guys need to travel if you think for one second that the U.S. left is left) are the baddies, or the republicans (who are genuine right in economic terms, and are talking protectionist in rhetoric only and actions are economically very aligned with the democrats)  are the baddies, you have missed the whole point.</p>

<p>FTR, Obama didn&#39;t start any open source wars. The CIA under his administration clearly used military means as they created the Arab Spring and uprisings in Libya and Syria. Other than that, Yemen is the only country that is a &quot;new&quot; target for American presidential administrations.  But Obama didn&#39;t &quot;start&quot; the others (Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Somalia) he simply continued the status quo. It&#39;s almost as if he, as a Democrat, was playing from the same playbook as the Republican before him....</p>

<p>The game is natural resources (which equals money), the method is unchallenged military power, the team is the Zionist and American elite, the players (tools) are the CIA and the Presidential administrations. There&#39;s no sides that are better than the other, they are both just pawns.</p>
