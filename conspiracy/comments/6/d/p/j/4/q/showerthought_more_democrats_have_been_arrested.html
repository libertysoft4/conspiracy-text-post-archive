    <div class="md"><p>Also what is stupid is the submission. Trump supporters here arent even posting conspiracy theories. Just generally <em>the other political party sucks but mine is awesome</em>. I dont even mind obvious trump propaganda conspiracies but these arent conspiracies today. Basically trumpets are unhappy there are so many trump conspiracies that people are awakening too so are now spamming non-conspiracies that are just partisan opinion. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No you are not. You are referencing pedophilia in general. What is dispicable is thst you tried to make a non partisan into a partisan issue but were shot down by other posters who pointed out to dozens of cases of pedophilia by republicans. </p>

<p>I understand you want to wage some partisan war ok fair enough but stick to conspiracy theories. And seriosuly even on boards like <a href="/r/t_d">/r/t_d</a> where your post would be liked you shouldnt ignore the many documented cases of pedophilia in the party you support as it makes it seem like you dont care about it </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump&#39;s coziness with Russia were being talked about as early as late 2015, a full year prior to Pizzagate becoming a thing, and was ramped up in earnest in the spring of 2016 as stories about people on his team having ties to Russia first started to circulate, so the theory that it was manufactured in order to distract from Pizzagate doesn&#39;t really hold much water. The timelines just don&#39;t add it.</p>

<p>More probable to believe that they&#39;re simply two separate issues.</p>

Don&#39;t care about the children, don&#39;t care about the wishes of the mother and father. They just want us fighting, so we miss the crimes their side is commit. </p>

<p>They don&#39;t want us talking about Trump selling arms to Saudi Arabia. They don&#39;t want us talking about our rights they are trying to steal from us like Net Neutrality and Internet Privacy. They don&#39;t want us talking about the bill that will take healthcare from 23 Million Americans. They don&#39;t want us talking about the new EPA regulations that are allowing coal companies to pollute our rivers and us chemical that are banned in EU.  They don&#39;t want us talking about the daily leaks that indicate Trump&#39;s team colluded with Russia. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The only thing in all those &quot;suspicious&quot; Pizzagate emails that was actually about real child abuse was the Dyncorp one. A bunch of assult-rifle toting mercenaries bullying a 15 year old kid. I&#39;m willing to bet all those guys voted for Trump. &quot;Liberal Democrat&quot; and &quot;professional mercenary&quot; don&#39;t usually go hand in hand</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also what is stupid is the submission. Trump supporters here arent even posting conspiracy theories. Just generally <em>the other political party sucks but mine is awesome</em>. I dont even mind obvious trump propaganda conspiracies but these arent conspiracies today. Basically trumpets are unhappy there are so many trump conspiracies that people are awakening too so are now spamming non-conspiracies that are just partisan opinion. </p>
