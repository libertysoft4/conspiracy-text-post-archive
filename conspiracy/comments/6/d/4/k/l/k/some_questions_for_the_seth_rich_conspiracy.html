    <div class="md"><p>Fair enough.</p>

<p>Questions for you.</p>

<p>We agree Seth was murdered.
We agree the murderers are still at large and the case is not solved</p>

<p>So why would Wikileaks be so interested in solving this, what vested interest would they have outside of it exposing something more?<br/>
Why would they (and be the only ones) offer a reward for information?  </p>

<p>If anyone including the DNC had any interest in putting this to bed then why would they try to do everything possible to stop the investigation or obstruct it?</p>

<p>The reason this conspiracy lives on is because it isn&#39;t resolved and those who stand to lose the most if it is in fact true seem to be the only ones not interested in solving it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a very good point. Democrats/Liberals/DNC members should be making the biggest fuss of all to get this solved. This was one of their boys. Why do they want everyone to just accept that this was a &quot;botched robbery&quot; and move on? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>how do you explain all the bruises Seth Rich had on his hands and face. why would wikileaks offer a huge reward for some random person who was murdered during a botched robbery? Why do you believe Brad Bauman, who is a known DNC operative who deals in crisis management. How do you explain David Brock being on the board of directors for Brad Bauman&#39;s foundation? There is way too much that doesn&#39;t add up. Plus, when the media is pushing their narrative as forcefully as they have been lately, that is a dead giveaway that something is up. This whole thing is fucky, and I just want the truth. The actual truth, not a truth that was thought up in some boardroom meeting. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>To answer questions one and two, maybe they didn&#39;t want it to look like an assassination. For question 3, maybe the assassins didn&#39;t take Seth&#39;s personal belongings in the off chance they were detained by police. Having the property of a man who was found dead in the streets is a dead giveaway that you did it. Duh. I don&#39;t think a double tap is the only way to send a message. A couple bullets to the back still sends a strong message. And in general, a couple bullets to the back will normally kill someone pretty quickly. The fact that he survived for awhile is probably just a fluke. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Even if this was just a totally random, &quot;botched robbery,&quot; it doesn&#39;t change the fact that it was Seth Rich who leaked the DNC emails to Wikileaks, and not the Russians. But the fact that the guy who leaked the emails got executed in the streets shortly after is just way to big of a coincidence for me. Anything&#39;s possible, but I think the most logical explanation is that he was assassinated. Corrupt politicians like Hillary Clinton absolutely do not give a fuck about taking out their enemies. It&#39;s just business.</p>

<p>This doesn&#39;t really help to further the conversation.  We&#39;re in a conspiracy sub, the proof for a lot of this stuff is going to be hard to find and circumstantial.  No one here can prove that it was the Russians and no one can prove that Seth Rich did the leaking.  Demanding proof isn&#39;t going to get us anywhere.</p>

<ol>
<li>They have a high degree of confidence that Mr. Rich was source of the emails. By offering a reward, they are signalling that they will work to ensure the security of potential future leakers. </li>
<li>They have a low degree of confidence or are otherwise uncertain as to the identity of their source, but still wish to project the image that they will work to ensure the security of sources. </li>
<li>They have no information indicating that Mr. Rich was the source of DNC documents... but <em>also</em> have a reasonable degree of confidence that the Seth Rich homicide investigation will <strong>not</strong> be solved.
3a. They are purposefully misdirecting in order to obfuscate their true source.
3b. They are purposefully misdirecting so as to lower confidence in the DNC, and deflect from accusations that Mr. Assange and the Wikileaks organizations have a working relationship with Russian intelligence services. </li>

    <div class="md"><p>So you’re making the incompetence defense here.  Let’s apply the same standard to the criminal investigation of Seth Rich’s murder … or to you own line of reasoning.   There are plenty of unanswered questions surrounding Rich’s death.   But the notion that answers should not be sought because the killer(s) were incompetent is like dismissing the lies of a veteran politician because normally he’s so much better at it.</p>

<li><p>He was probably running from them and its not all that easy to get a head shot on a moving target. Apparently he said &quot;I&#39;ve got heat&quot; over the phone just before it happened, so he was aware that he was being stalked.</p></li>
<li><p>Because they didn&#39;t want it to look like an assassination.</p></li>
<li><p>Because they panicked, or because they were afraid of getting caught while stealing his stuff since they had just fired two shots, or a host of other reasons. Perhaps they just weren&#39;t that concerned with making it look like a robbery, but didn&#39;t want it to look like an assassination. There are tons of potential answers to this.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I disagree with your conclusions. The hitman or hitmen may have been a bit sloppy, but that is well within the realm of possibility.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you think it&#39;s fishy that Bauman is connected to David Brock, what is your opinion on Ed Butowsky, the friend of Steve Brannon who financed the &quot;investigation&quot; that yielded the fake story about the laptop and emails to dinosaur? Or the fact that Bukowsky visited the White House a few weeks ago? That seems way more concrete a connection.</p>
