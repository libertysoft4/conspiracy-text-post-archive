<p>Recent activity indicates potential locations of nagano or another indonesian/ Philippines area quake. Id wager closer to fukushima area if Japan takes the fall. </p>

<p>33% likely to see this play out elsewhere. Its a big one. Likely 7.0 - 8.0+ so while east coast japan is my primary location of interest at this time there is a slight chance that we see activity in Elsalvador Chile or New Zealand.</p>

<p><strong>Main location of interest. 38 km E off Hitachi, Japan 6.9 - 7.4</strong> <em>50-25 km depth-</em></p>

<p>Strangelets possible on usa west coast. 4.0- 5.0 activity. (California). </p>

<p>The bz only opens like that when we get rocked. Stay safe out there guys. </p>

<p>Probably a round of 6.0 - 5.5 aftershocks seen globally over next 48 hours. </p>

<p><strong>update</strong>
1204am 5 28 2017</p>

<p>45 minutes ago 4.5 magnitude, 125 km depth 
Shiki, Saitama, Japan</p>

<p>(depth implies foreshock). </p>

<p>Edit. Holy shit front page of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. Thanks guys :)</p>

<p>Hope we see this pan out now :) </p>

<p><em>(no offense to japan).</em></p>

<p><strong>Update (10 hrs in) 527am. 5/28/2017</strong>
<a href="http://services.swpc.noaa.gov/images/geospace-1-day.png">full bz breaching</a></p>

<p>Just wanted to say that was a huge breach. We ahould truly be seeing a huge eq this run. Could easily go 8.0 (although solar winds were quite weak in that regard). </p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>
1:11 pm 5.28.2017
<a href="http://services.swpc.noaa.gov/images/geospace-1-day.png">bz componet now fully zipped</a></p>

<p>In regards to my theory this earthquake is now postulating. 
The energy has breached the magnetosphere heavily. Aiding to growth and expansion of the earths inner flux tubes at this time. </p>

<p>We are cruizing a low wind speed which is great for a test. 350km/s effectively. A 325 would be better.  </p>

<p>Now we wait in anticipation. We appear to be just several hours away from the main shock. </p>

<p>Stay safe at reddit and japan. :)</p>

<p><strong>Notes on bz component:</strong></p>

<p><em>This is a very moderate wind stream with a very long duration. I assess the incoming earthquake to reflect that.</em></p>

<p><strong>Update 2:06pm (pst) 5/29/2017</strong></p>

<p><strong>Today</strong></p>

<p>about 6 hours ago </p>

<p><strong>6.8 magnitude</strong>, <em>9 km depth</em>
<strong>Poso, Central Sulawesi, Indonesia</strong></p>

<p><strong>conclusion</strong>
We have now seen a planetary bell ringer in a primary named location. <em>Users in other named locations may not be out of hot water at this time.</em> It was a large breach and I feel that this is not the only quake of this scale to take place throughout the nest two days. I apologise and would like to admit I RECIEVED THIS DATA LATE. This lead to an uncertainty in the exact naming of locations. Working as fast as I could three locations were named. All showing signs of activity. Had I had more time I feel I&#39;d have done better in tracking this event. My apologies. </p>

<p><strong>If you are from another location named. Stay precautious for the next 48 hours. Please and TY</strong></p>

<p>Aurora Watch / Solar Wind</p>

<p>A high speed solar wind stream above 600 km/s is now moving past Earth. Enhanced geomagnetic activity reaching minor (G1) storm levels will be possible during the next 24 hours. High latitude sky watchers should be alert for visual aurora when it is dark outside. Data below courtesy of the DSCOVR spacecraft</p>

<p>Coronal Hole Update / Geomagnetic Storm Watch
On the sun, middle latitude coronal hole #47 will become geoeffective over the next 24-72 hours. A minor (G1) geomagnetic storm watch will be in effect after December 20th once a high speed solar wind stream arrives past our planet. Here on Earth, sky watchers at higher latitudes should be alert for visible aurora later this week. Stay tuned to SolarHam.com for the most up to date information.

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Your posts are a bit difficult for me, but on this thread it looks like you&#39;re predicting a likelihood of a 7.0 or larger earthquake in the Fukushima area  2- 48 hours from the time of your original post.</p>

<p>I hope I got your message right?</p>

<p>If so, wouldn&#39;t you alert other science communities or emergency services to this possibility?</p>

<p>In all seriousness, buy futures based on your predictions, even if just a small amount.  I guarantee you will be found.  When you monetize your knowledge they always find you.</p>

<p>What&#39;s your background btw?  You speak very fluently about a number of disparate domains.  Stats?  Combinatorics?  Clearly you&#39;re some sort of quant.  I used to do political predictioneering with game theory and you seem to have a flavor of it in your work.  In any case, keep up the awesome work, I always enjoy reading your hypotheses.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My best friend is like you.  Brilliant, lacks all formal training, makes lateral thinking across domains seem machine-like, and is completely unaware of how big a difference he could really make if someone just directed and organized for him.  I find the smartest people also tend to be those who can&#39;t reconcile their intellect within the social / political / economic architecture we&#39;ve established as a society.  It&#39;s simply beneath them (in a good way).  Sort of like a ego = 1/knowledge type of thing.  Idiots always shout the loudest.  </p>

<p>Good to know you and please try to start building up the confidence to make a difference outside of anonymous message boards.

    <div class="md"><p>I seriously feel like tesla-</p>

<p>Edison was an opportunist. A clever wordsmith with immoral practices and slightly questionable motives in everything he did. </p>

<p>I feel tragic for tesla reaply. The man truly was snever credited fully for the brilliance he harbored. Thats truly tragic on so many levels. </p>

<p>I didnt know that was an Einstein quote. </p>

<p>Although there is a quick joke in the movie idiocracy involving Einstein. Where the main character. (an all round fully average bloke) goes forward in time to emerge in the future with another time traveller his age. While having been average in the past as he now emerges into this world he is paraded about as the &#39;smartest man alive&#39;. Due to human logical degradation. When he sees his partner again she asks him: &quot;do you think this is what its like being einstein&quot;? &quot;Just walking about looking around &quot;feeling like you&#39;re surrounded by dumbarses&quot;? To which he replies. Huh maybe?. </p>

<p>She replies with a snappy: &quot;maybe thats why he invented the bomb&quot;! </p>

<p>Sometimes I truly see it as a parting gift he never wished to give. Yet the joke in itself is quite hilarious. :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Having done some amateur theoretical physics sleuthing for the past 10ish years, I&#39;m pretty solid on the belief that gravity is flat out wrong.  I think that gravity and relativity describe a series of interactions well in a vacuum, but utterly fail at describing a system.  Things like the assumption that the speed of light is the upper governor for the universe seem oddly convenient for the model to work.  I would bet the house that gravity isn&#39;t real and that electro-magnestism is the true answer to a unified field theory.  I think there is a flaw in Maxwells equations (which Einstein also worked on) and if ever rectified will explain the physical occurrences of a whole host of things we thought impossible.  It&#39;s fun to think about.  </p>

<p>Regarding Tesla, this is a good read.  Not only does it demonstrate his brilliance and full commitment to embracing concepts most would consider fantastical (as he was never a slave to the Newtonian model), it also sheds a good bit of light on the man himself.  He was a funny dude.</p>

<p>I feel weve so much to learn about space that your gradually right. Weve used cesium in labs to accelerate light past the traditional &#39;speed of light&#39; slightly proving it isnt impossible. While synthetic, it goes on to show your thoughts are fully rational. </p>

<p>I think what preturbes me is how linear it is to be an outside thinker in these fields. As though we must believe in every rule to get the job. Any considerably indifferent opinion will be a deal breaker. </p>

I am very thankful to have this paper youve found by him. I truly look forward to reading more of his work. If you find anything on his geomagnetic harmonic reaonance. Please do send that myway. I have a feeling its important to what I am doing now :)</p>

<p><strong>about the event</strong>:</p>

<p>May 27, 2017 @ 22:20 UTC</p>

<p>CME Passage / Bz South / G2 Storm (UPDATED)
A fairly weak shock passage was observed today by the DSCOVR spacecraft. A minor geomagnetic enhancement will be possible during the next 24 hours. A widespread disturbance is not currently expected.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> <em>The Bz component of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) continues to point sharply south (-20nT), a condition known to enhance geomagnetic activity. Moderate (G2) storming is now being observed at higher latitudes. Sky watchers should be alert for visible aurora once dark outside.</em></p>

<p><strong>ALERT:</strong> Geomagnetic K-index of 6
Threshold Reached: 2017 May 27 2322 UTC
Synoptic Period: 2100-2400 UTC
Active Warning: Yes
NOAA Scale: G2 - Moderate</p>

<p>SUMMARY: Geomagnetic Sudden Impulse
Observed: 2017 May 27 1536 UTC
Deviation: 19 nT
Station: BOU</p>

<p>Listening, read that, no idea what it means. It&#39;s interesting.</p>

<p>Could you phrase the info for the casual reader?</p>

<p>Is it a positive prediction for an earthquake? But that earthquake could happen anywhere from Chile to Japan? That hardly nails it down, they&#39;re at opposite ends of the earth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Holy smokes this is all waaayy out of my realm. Just looked up BZ component:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The magnetic field of our Sun doesn&#39;t stay around the Sun itself. The solar wind carries it through the Solar System until it reaches the heliopause. The heliopause is the place where the solar wind comes to a stop and where it collides with the interstellar medium. Because the Sun turns around her axis (once in about 25 days) the interplanetary magnetic field has a spiral shape which is called the Parker Spiral.</p>

<p>Bt value</p>

<p>The Bt value of the interplanetary magnetic field indicates the total strength of the interplanetary magnetic field. The higher this value, the better it is for enhanced geomagnetic conditions. Moderate Interplanetary Magnetic Field strength values start at 15nT but for middle latitude locations, values of 25nT or more are desirable.</p>

<p>Bx, By and Bz</p>

<p>The interplanetary magnetic field is a vector quantity with a three axis component, two of which (Bx and By) are orientated parallel to the ecliptic. The Bx and By components are not important for auroral activity. The third component, the Bz value is perpendicular to the ecliptic and is created by waves and other disturbances in the solar wind.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Locations are based on area seismic data available.</p>

<p>All locations are relevant to area activity. Vs time expectancy.</p>

<p>By that regard fukushima Japan is due for a 7.0 scale earthquake. Due to the recently calm activity. We gauge the nagano activity as a &#39;hint of potential mega quaking&#39;. This rises its probability. 70%</p>

<p>Areas known to have this &#39;scale&#39; of activity are also relevant by association to the expected size. I replied below with a wind chart to express this per interval. </p>

<p>The scale of quake we associate that type of activity too is 7.0 scale. </p>

<p>Locations known for that range in no unique order. 
Kamtchaka/alaska, NZ, chile, elsalvador, us west coast, japan, phillipeans, indonesia, nepal, afganistan/pakistan, ect. </p>

<p>Then we gauge the time loss vs current activity. </p>

<p>When we see strangelets they associate hints. Yet tine loss is the more critical factor by argument. Due to the time loss since a japanese quake. In addition to the activity. Fukushima japan is the likliest location with a higher probability then the other selected areas. </p>

<p>The usa west coast would likely only go active in an 8.0 event. Having eigher a pacofoc northwest or sanfransiscan 5.0 to follow an otherwise large event. </p>

<p>I expect only to see a 7.3 range quake. Likely downgraded to a 7.0-6.9 however it will be vast in its arrival. Which will be very soon. (as in a matter of hours. 2 days at tge very most). </p>

<p>Likely all named areas will see heightened activity following this quake. (in the thread). Not this comment. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No this is my own theory. I am unfamiliar with the gap theory...</p>

<p>My theory involves solar protons reacting with the earths magnetic flux tubes influencing the basic seismology model. Much like a dj stretches a sound on a record player. I feel that incoming solar winds complicate the flux tubes conveying (leading to the creation of earthquakes). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They had a set back. Actually I nailed the crash in my otger thread. Stating 215 being the eth price for the bubble pop. The trail off missed the mark, as I assessed more solidarity in the ltc community. Yet the pre position of a crash was ultimately on point. </p>

<p>They pushed too hard and hugged it to death. Instead of simply holding firm a slight stampede occured. Its still a safe investment. Likely a better one today then yesterday. Although they are currently likely to lose another 100+/- depending on where ethereum sets its price. I feel 250 is irrational and see 168-175 being the new norm. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely. 
They need to refurbish their community and take on promoting themselves as a utility. </p>

<p>The problem I find they have is they promote bitcoin more then themselves. 
Eth is using corporate level tactics. Essentially eth is as valuable as doge with their non existent cap. They are a vampire coin and much more likely to succeed as they &#39;give away coins to refugees in a un food program.  </p>

<p>My take on this is that bitcoin and litecoin holders need to boycott them and stop trading with them until they create a cap. Otherwise btc and ltc will be &#39;giving away their inflations&#39; to these refugees as they trade the coins out for lunch money. </p>

<p>Factually that angers me. 
How can we ever inflate our price if eth us giving out 100,000 + people &quot;an undisclosed amount of coins&quot;?</p>

<p>Here we are depending on users to appreciate their worth. While the eth users bash all coins in mass on a one way street promoting citcuit. Then they cash them out for vasic survival. </p>

<p>Traders aren&#39;t helping with their weak hands falling for it either. They gwt psyched out and sell into eth. Then when eth pulls all cryptos take the hit. It is an endless circle-</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hear alot about new alts, like steam or xrp. I just consider then all niche investments from a linear point of view. 
I&#39;d suggest sticking to the known ones and rarely investing in emerging markets until they establish an actual userbase and have solidified their entire network to a publishable level. Life is too short to take risks. </p>

<p>The main comeup today through tuesday is taking stock in eth at a low then selling at a high. Since eth just rapidly expanded its usership and worth its a good long twrm investment. Yet playing off its growth is a profitable way to up your current coin purse. </p>

<p>The window of its growth is settling. I hear tuesday should be a big day for ltc. (followed by weds).  Sunday is always a btc day. </p>

<p>Most coins rely on media for growth. A general tip is to really extort the amount of growth the utility will recieve based on the articles. Since sunday is the day before monday presses. It always reflects a solid in take. I feel this is the utilitys way of setting itself up for more clients. Investing quietly in itself. This way to secure a good week on the presses. </p>

<p>The other advice id give is use a three pronged spear. </p>

<p>Keep all currency in a seperate account. Prior to investing in any coin place a 5.00 usd investment in three coins. Wait 1 hour and every 10 minites sample the market. Which ever shows the most promise is likely the best coin to co tribute to for the day. Basic sampling should be perofrmed any time prior to moving wages on the floor. So leaving a 15.00 buy in behind helps to speed up the process. </p>

<p>Also document timing and volumes. Never trade a coin against the chatter on screen and if its going to good pull out. Most people get addicted to greed. I saw the bubble popping early and warned my friend. He was in great ahape leaving early. 
So always run if its too good to be true. 9 timea out of 10 it is. :)</p>

<p>-9.72 +/- in checking...</p>

<p>Wrote a book. Had bad feedback due to grammar. Give away basically everything in hopes the karma will come back. Help friend make money on investments plotting coin charts. They lose it before I am ever paid. Invest my time in reading, use the data to promote good things and charity to the world. Do everything I can to be a good person. 
Cant seem to catch a break. Since my life fell apart my wages get garnished die to child support. 
Any job I take I am paid half my earnings. So far behind now I doubt I will ever ever catch up. </p>

<p>I could probably be given 50k and blow it. Just to actually have a chance at surviving and starting at square one. </p>

<p>Because thats likely never going to happen. I just give all I can away now for free. In short its better the world has it then I pass on in some fot of demanded grandeur. </p>

<p>Not everyone gets a shot on this rock. 
Miss my gf. Miss my life. After a year on a couch, having every ounce of work ive put in not paying off. I just don&#39;t feel that I will ever get out of this rut. 
Not here, bot now. Not ever. </p>

<p>I have so little I don&#39;t even attempt to really succeed or make ot out anymore. I am just broken and recluse. Giving the last bits of myself and sanity away, as I pray for a future. Yet fear it all the same. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry to hear about it all. I also am stuck in a similar rut, in terms of not even attempting to succeed and just being so &quot;done&quot; with life to try to sum it up simply. But there is more to it all. You are here for a reason, you chose to reincarnate as that life for a reason.(Sorry don&#39;t mean to push beliefs or assume)</p>

<p>My advice is to take it slow. Little steps can be a big achievement when trying to fit your life back in to the &quot;norm&quot; that society demands. Living with your parents affords you the opportunity to save money even if it is just a little bit. Most are not as fortunate.</p>

<p>But I have a feeling you will refine your research to a point of being irrefutable. I actually believe in you more than I do myself. So always remember that folks do care and want your success. Even though we are just text on a forum board, we are still people. I don&#39;t do this but every few years but I will pray for you and your well being. It does seem to work once in awhile.</p>

<p>I am still alive though, so I have that going for me. :)</p>

<p>I truly missed ya and hoped you were well. I wanted to emerge sooner but I felt ot was best to take a sort of siesta for a brief moment to relax. Im past it. Truly happy to be surrounded by my friends like you again :)</p>

<p>Radio communications break down, transformers can overload, circuits can run haywire. </p>

Well, our magnetic field is linked to all that ferrous material in our crust, the Earth spinning, and the hot core spinning at a different speed. When electromagnetic radiation hits our magnetic field en masse, do you not think it likely that our magnetic field will react to that, potentially just enough to shift a couple of plates for an earthquake?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Originally I coined this theory geo magnetic harmonic resonance. If anything id meet tou at electro magnetic stimulation. There is a root factor I am debating with this whole theory being either an electric vs magnetic phenomena. I often wager it as both until tests can be conducted. </p>

<p>To me its more so an unsolvable argument and likely is both or should be considered both until one process can effectively be worked out. I chose an electric process due to the standard model yet agree magnetics is likely much to do with it. </p>

<p>If enough tests come back positive showing a correlation I truly hope to be allowed a single field experiment to test the theory someday. It would be noce to know if we cant officially prove it at this time.<br/>
It would be so nice to factually say I am not wasting anyones time and truly have something amazing to offer the world. Until then. I suppose I will simply keep wrapping my brain around it. </p>

<p>You make the assumption that these changes can move earth enough to create a fault. That would require for more change than what is detected.</p>

<p>I am going to put this lightly, this isn&#39;t some new field of science this guy discovered. He just has a really poor understanding of math and physics. His page is complete and total bunk science.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/335723937/Advanced-Seismic-Prediction-via-Solar-Wind-Velocity">https://www.scribd.com/document/335723937/Advanced-Seismic-Prediction-via-Solar-Wind-Velocity</a></p>

<p>That hardly even reads as coherent English. It&#39;s a stream of consciousness using random science words.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>These solar wind fields contain a vast amount of elements, Which act as harbingers towards seismic events here on earth.  The principal forces I see taking place are magnetic, electric, and ionizing materials.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is nonsense and it totally reads like someone who has taken at a max high school level science classes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I suppose it is. That&#39;s definitely got me worried. I know that I&#39;m stocked up, it might be smart for you and others to visit <a href="/r/preppers">/r/preppers</a>. Chances are an event like that could trigger other seismic activity, including the Yellowstone Supervolcano. </p>

<p>Tremors and other small events may be relieving pressure, but that&#39;ll still be pretty ugly. Ash clouds reducing sunlight for several months, gases and the pyroclastic flow would suffocate the immediate area, and people will definitely die. </p>

<p>The trick is to be the guy who preps to last longer than the majority of the population. Once every man exhausts the several weeks supply of food in their pantry, and all their water, making it shorter, it&#39;s all clear for the apocalypse. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ive really considered the juan defuca event as capable of promoting nw volcanos to become active. This singularity very well could be movement enough to rattle yellowstone awake. 
Juan de fuca has several area vilcanoes near it. Maby being submarine volcanoes. Such as off the californian coast. </p>

<p>Your general synopsis is correct from what Ive researched. The main thing I&#39;d suggest prepping in that extent is anything to replicate the suns environment. Good lighting with full spectrum red green blue hues. Light reduction is critical on our bodies. </p>

<p>In the event of a yellowstone I see maybe a 3 month lightless cycle fillowed by vast intervals of clouding and acid rains. 
I think its the after effects people wont be ready for like acid rain that will be most devistating. </p>

<p>Having to check water for contamination. Not eating specific foods, and learning which days to avoid the toxic weather patterns that would follow. </p>

<p>Buttoning down is the easy part. Having enough to make it is hard. Yet imagining the storm systems and hurricane force winds, facing the aftershocks that will take place always wondering if another event is likely to occur. </p>

<p>There will be little things like loneliness attacking your conscious. Expired memories haunting you of all you lost. </p>

<p>To me that anguish, and the relearning and trend setting is what will be the most devistating affect. </p>

<p>No going outside in grey storm clouds.  Avoiding winters new cycles of extreme freezes. Avoiding highly contaminated areas (with likely no warning)  </p>

<p>I mean thats the life I see. So yes your tragically accurate, in most regards. (from what we know based on fossil records)...</p>

<p>I imagine its far worse then either any you me or one hear can actually imagine. Although their is a really good pompei volcano remake in hd recently that sort of mirrors what we could probably expect here when we see it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks, that was really enlightening. I am far enough away from most volcanic activity (Sedona AZ), that I should be able to weather out the beginning. It&#39;s the later effects like acid rain, unpredictable weather, etc, that you mentioned that are going to be the main issues. </p>

<p>I&#39;m planning on setting up a hydroponics system of sorts, and a spirulina growth tank. I&#39;ll unfortunately be reliant upon food stores for those several months, as I don&#39;t have a generator. Climate patterns should mostly hold. I&#39;m in a desert with minimal cloud cover and rainfall most of the year, so my food plan shouldn&#39;t be affected. </p>

<p>On the bright side, the ash released would most likely seed water bodies with nutrients, boosting fish populations. That&#39;d make fishing a better long-term food source. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its humble. Tbh arizonas high elevation and cave&#39;s give you a vast upperhand in either scenario. Even slc area has the heightened elevation which would be ideal post event. (less rain). 
All you really need to focus on now is life in the mean time and the little things. 
Most people forget that its the slight tells that nature gives us that is our true advantage and warning system. From animal movements to seeing a new crack form in a sidewalk. To noticing repair work needed in area basements, and solar data. All these are harbingers of vast events. 
Take them all with a gradual level of importance. </p>

<p>Animal movements are the most ideal methods in my opinion. Noticing a flock of birds take flight or seeing a fawn of dear in migration is your best bet something is wrong. From there dogs will bark, cats will scatter. Thats when your certain its on the fritz...</p>

<p>My advice to you. A. Don&#39;t stand in a doorway nor under am object that can&#39;t suooort the weight of the ceiling / floors above you. Its better to lay in a pocket between a couch and solid wood coffee table. (not the cheap kind). </p>

<p>This is because after incidents users found that people in doorways get chopped in half when the wood splits. Also desks seem to crush school children (cases seen in variius post event scenarios). While cubbies formed around thr sesks which they could have laid in to survive. (much like a bed of nails holds an item vs a single nail). 
B. Time the event in your head. In a major eq. Communications will be lost immedieatly. </p>

<p>Your only way to guage a tsunami is by timibg the event in your head. The seco d the event starts start counting to both remain calm, yet prepared. Anything past 5 minutes is a 7.0+ if youve reached anywhere near 6 minutes your in a 9.0. Expect a potential tsunami if within two miles from the coast. C. Know of area resources and areas of concern. </p>

<p>You dont want to live through an earthquake to walk into a lions den. Be sure that area nuclear facilities are a good distance away. Or place the distance between yourself. Just encase the facility is damaged. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I list potential areas, and often strangelets. Strangelets being hypothetical to the tinedilation model. Vs. the showing relevant activity model. </p>

<p>Typically there are seismic &#39;tells&#39; prior to a quake. Since we have an effective &#39;seismic range&#39; via the incoming solar weather, what we look for is a common area both expecting an eq based on its yearly intervals. As well as one thats known to match the incoming scale of activity. Often there are dormant areas that reflect this activity showing no activity. Thus I feel these are Strangelets (or comparable) in that regard. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>exactly ... this is the last argument ill make with you
so as you say 16  7.0&#39;s a year.. you notice we haven&#39;t had a 7.0 worldwide in  a while few weeks. figure you will play your odds with where one will be. Why even try to predict? you aren&#39;t going be right always. 16 7.0s is more than 1  7.0 earth quake every month thats pretty common
trying to predict things in general is a ability I don&#39;t see the value in. your time would much better be spent learning about nearly anything else. A skill accomplishes something 100% of the time. Where as your &quot;skill&quot; doesn&#39;t accomplish anything in the end, you could say.. &quot;see i told you so&quot; So there is that if you want to count that as something. you can&#39;t stop the earthquake from happening where ever it happens. No one should evacuate based on your warnings because you won&#39;t always be right. anyone could do what you do it&#39;s not that hard you just spent a lot of time doing something insignificant most people wouldn&#39;t bother trying to do. I certainly wouldn&#39;t invest time in it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It isn&#39;t about stopping an earthquake from happening its about the advancement of seismic warning systems. </p>

<p>I am documenting significant arguments which establish a rooted connection to earths largest seismic events and our most complex solar wind patterns. </p>

<p>There is significance in documwnting that relationship regardless of your pessimism. Factually a ocnnection could lead to the very complex journey of devising a smart system. One which operates an algorith which detects the likely probability of an incoming seismic event. Using real time solar weather feeds. </p>

<p>But its not like I am not doing &#39;just that with my life&#39;. </p>

<p>In fact that is exactly what I am doing my life. Carry on-</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You too. 
I sort of feel happy and try to befriend all users. I dislike when they attempt to discredit me with a &#39;not sane&#39; image. Yet to be honest Ive been here 8 months doing this and havent seemed to give off that impression. </p>

<p>If I factually updated everyday 3 times aday. Id probably question my own sanity. Yet 1-2 postd a month (which seems generous) seems rational, and every update has existing data sets. (so this isnt exactly not backed by science). I just hope thats not the reason why they seem to &#39;take interest&#39;. </p>

<p>To me its just a basic theory. I think it holds real meaning hence all the times Ive placed my reputation on it. </p>

<p>So its just that: a working theory. Plave as much weight onto it as you all care or like. :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly this was a really tough quake to plot due to yoyr recent activity. </p>

<p>I am assessing japan as the main location. Yet there is a slight chance this could come your way. </p>

<p>I feel that your elevated activity slighlty reduces your chance as it allows pressure to decrease. Japan is now showing heightened activity with an exosting depth that is common in foreshocks. So that also can relieve you. </p>

<p>I actually assessed your last 6.9 on my past account. So I am pretty good at this. I think your in the clear this run yet if the japanese quake occurs I would expect more 4.5 level aftershocks in your area. </p>

<p>Pretty likely you wont see anything too big at this time. Yet these locations are noted in case the area is off by a margain. So just know that the worst likely has passed at this time. (for your nation). :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Japans system isnt exactly a cost effective system which they gain much from. I think the current system is maybe 60 seconds advanced warning. </p>

<p>The system detects deep ground movements as a sort of heart beat for inner earth. When a p wave is detected it essentially allows a warning at the cusp of the initial wave. By the time a message is sent we typically feel the event as it came. 
Trumps tactic was likely to cut spending. Its likely a good move in respects to the system being proposed really onpy saving us a minute. (at a multi million dollars in expenditures). Since it doesnt mitigate the event or really give us much time to prepare, I could see why they decided to scrap this. </p>

<p>In a real way if I could log time on australias array and get a reaearch grouo together, I teuly feel I could gain anywhere from a day to a weeks additional time with the basis of my model. </p>

<p>Maybe a month depending on how far another researchers advanced sunspot projection model is coming around. </p>

<p>So spending several million on a system that is likely a year away from being outdated seems like a slightly good move in my opinion. So long as a newer model is being designed. </p>

<p>I dont feel that the planned system was quite worth its weight in gold in that regard. </p>

<p>So far the only successful prediction and evacuation​ before an earthquake is Haicheng, China where they saved something like 50,000 people after someone noticed animals started acting weird. This is dismissed as pseudoscience by most of the West but the Chinese are still researching it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>UrEDAS, and it&#39;s only like an 8 second warning typically.</p>

<p>An earthquake gives off fast moving but low amplitude P-waves and slow moving, high amplitude S-waves (these are the ones which do the damage). UrEDAS uses extremely sensitive electromagnetic seismometers to detect these P-waves and give warning for the oncoming S-waves.</p>

<p>Although it&#39;s not much as far as getting to safety or evacuating goes that 8 seconds is enough to fully stop the bullet train, hide under a desk and shut off gas supplies.</p>

<p>It&#39;s extremely useful because you don&#39;t have to deal with trains derailing or massive fires like the one that wiped out Kobe.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree every second counts. Yet the cost associated woth the previous system likely wouldnt be justified as soon as a new system is viable. </p>

<p>Its like buying a 1980 minivan for 25k on credit. (when your already in debt). 
I assume thay a more effective system can be utilized that costs less. Cost is a huge concern of america at this time. We have a very finite amount to spend and a vast set of Infastructure which needs updating. </p>

<p>If we were doing better economically we would be better off and Id argue it as a more critical necessitate. </p>

<p>I feel we will take on these types of costs as the budget is reduced and finds a level ground. Yet until the past administrations slack is picked up, I just don&#39;t see such an expenditure taking such top priority in the extent it provides such little roi. </p>

<p>No / Yes? 
Japan is very well suited in its infrastructure. This will be a more then vast event. Much stronger then their &#39;weekly /daily&#39; activity. Yet for the most part its more so just a really big event with a slightly unsettling period of stress associated with it. 
If this were in nepal, it woykd be far more destructive. </p>

<p>Scale 1 to 100 on danger. Id give it a 70. Enough to strike concern, yet fairely little loss of life. Some general property damages. And maybe a reported but what will be negligable tsunami associated with it. (like 10 inch waves). Maybe a third a meter tops...</p>

<p>Aside from long range. Its really not an assessment I can make as the solar data seemingly is fixed to a weekly progression at best. Sometimes it goves a 33 day window yet spots can hyper inflate in a two day time. As well as circling the lens holding their initial magnitude. </p>

<p>So I expect you will have a sizeable aftershock in this sequence. Yet the area appears generally stable. </p>

<p>Just an hour or so ago a sizeable 5+ (mag) struck near tokyo. I assume this will all but confirm a location near hitachi as the main shock. I am staying awake as best as I can to document it. :)</p>

<p>Hope all is well with you two :). 
All my love to you and yours as always!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No way I am letting you two have all the fun without me. </p>

<p>I slightly expect a tsunami warning to take place yet I wouldn&#39;t place it as a heightened event.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t want to say &quot;everything is fine&quot;. Follow instructions accordingly, yet I doubt a major event will occur in that respect. </p>

<p>I suppose just breathe and realize that its more then likely a small scale event. As your only in 8.0 territory. Which will more likely be a mid range to low level 7.0 as it is created. </p>

<p>So again. It shouldn&#39;t be too bad a shake in your region and the waves will likely be 10 inches. Quite laughable in that regard. </p>

<p>Glad to hear you two are well. Happy to help anytime guys :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you! You are always so kind and it warms my heart.</p>

<p>The warning we get on our smartphones before an earthquake only leaves us with around ten to fifteen seconds to get to safety, which sadly for a lot of people isn&#39;t enough time. Luckily we&#39;re home tonight but if it happens tomorrow it&#39;ll be a bit trickier since we&#39;re back at work. I just hope it doesn&#39;t happen while either of us is commuting. </p>

<p>Do you think it&#39;ll happen at some point in the next twelve hours?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Technically I think a 12 hour warning is fair. To be honest I almost missed this event and checked the solar data on a fluke. To my amazement a seemingly long breach was there quite unexpectedly. Its more so luck then anything that you all are reading this post. Noaa had it written off so I disregarded yet checked again last minute for sport. 
And as always. No worries.
Hopefully it comes at a convenient time for you both :)
That would make my day to know good company is in  better health and safety:)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not worried. 
Just extra precautionary. I am assessing this event to come in a matter of hours. 
If the earthquake comes tokyo is the safest city in japan to be in. 
Count in your head and time the event. If you make it to 4.5 minutes. Make your way to high ground immedieatly. 
(as a precautionary step). </p>

<p>Again tokyo is very safe. 
They went through a 9.0 before with very little structural damages. This should be like a speed bump in that regard. </p>

<p>Technically your just being responsible for the day. With likely more warning then anyone there. </p>

<p>So take a level of comfort in that. Don&#39;t consider it anything less then lucky :)</p>

<p>But when that doesn&#39;t happen you have also thrown a load of locations at us spread across the entire globe so you can say &quot;see! there was seismic activity!&quot;</p>

<p>That doesn&#39;t even answer my question of why <em>48 hours</em>, and why you cannot be more accurate.</p>

<p>You can&#39;t even give a straight answer about what you will say if it doesn&#39;t happen. Can&#39;t you see how this sounds like a completely cop-out?

<p>So in one breath you say his claims are extraordinary, in another breath you say they are ordinary.  Which is it?</p>

<p>In fact, OP IS making an extraordinary claim.  He is saying there&#39;s going to be a 7.0+ earthquake within 48 hours of his post.  He&#39;s also said it will be newsworthy.

    <div class="md"><p>EQ prediction is only viable if it allows effective evacuation for the proposed affected area. As there is a distance of 1,905 miles between the Philippine&#39;s and Japan this is not an effective prediction in the slightest. This is even before you factor in the effects of attenuation on a 7-8 magnitude quake.</p>

<p>Finally there have been 495 quakes to hit Japan in the past 12 months, make no mistake there was no prediction made here today!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I imagine you will have a good shock soon. 
I truly feel its more then likely to occur stemming from another quake. Essentially we will see a 7.0+japan. Followed by a nz 5.5 Philippines 5.5 turkey 4.0 alaska 4.6 and californian 4.5
Maybe even a 4.0 washington strangelet</p>

<p>The most impressive of events appears to be building up. I think we are moments or hours away. </p>

<p>The BZ is fully zipped and it was a very long duration influx. So I expect to see a very long earthquake by that effect. A true global bell ringer. </p>

<p>My guess is 80% of heliplots will document the incoming main shocks as they manifest. </p>

<p>So you will likely see a sizeable quake. 
Stay safe and operate under the impression that one could come today. Not in an insane fearing mindset. Simply remain mindful that we have had a vast moment of time where energy has breached our planets core. Which will make its way to the surface soon. </p>

<p>Stay safe and no worries. I truly feel your missing the worst of it this time around. :)</p>

<p>You will see 4 sections on this graphic. </p>

<p>The first section is the bz componet. This is the escursion of atomic material penetrating the magnetosphere. </p>

<p>As the lines draw away from one and other a breach is occuring. When they move towards eachother again the event is nearing its end. </p>

<p>Those protons feed into the planets core via their bonding to a magnet tube. Known as a flux tube which conveyors within the planets core. 
The conveyoring seeds the magma bed with additional heat decay. Causing it to expand. As it retracts the cavity collapses causing a P wave. Which makes its way to the planets surface. </p>

<p>This process typically takes a matter of hours. 
The solar winds are also lowering to a more effective holding speed. (330 now).325 is ideal. </p>

<p>The speed graphic is the third tear down on the graphic included in the link. </p>

<p>I assess a 325 - 300 as an optimal holding speed for earths solar winds. </p>

<p>As we reach that period the event will likely come to frutition. Please be patient :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You will likely feel about a 6.5 event. (in tokyo). Uet I assess a 7.2- 7.4 at this time. (Roughly 4.26 minutes) in duration. </p>

<p>I expect this to occur within the next 18 hours. </p>

<p>I think its always a 50/50 probability. (I am either going to be right or wrong after all). Much of this is determined by the data. Not much had to do with a personal level of response by myself. Its just an assessment based on the data available.</p>

<p>The science is often supported by an existing event. I imagine this to be more southern having an offshore hitachi  located epicenter. </p>

<p>Time the event in your head. If its any longer then 270 seconds make your way to high ground. (for optimal safety). That&#39;s good advice if communications are reduced. As anything in such a duration could create a sizeable Tsunami. Without a digital communication device. You will have fairly little warning of an event associated with an earthquake. </p>

<p>I truly feel this will take place within the next 18 hours. It was a long duration BZ breach. Which could add to the timeline. While id still be technically right.  I truly am working on dialing the timing down. Its truly more to do with the data as it comes. Making it more difficult to produce a more effective scheduling system with the tools at my disposal. </p>

<p>So I assume 18 hours. Or less. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the detailed reply. Is the 18 hour time slot meaning you expect it to happen within the 18 hours, so literally any moment from now on, or to happen IN 18 hours time? Just trying to plan my movements during this time in case something does happen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No worries. 
To be honest I was expecting the next several hours. Yet the solar wind data was a vast event. (which could extend that window). I don&#39;t want to oncote fear mind youm if anything consider tokyo is highly prepared in their national construction for these events.</p>

<p>To me (that citys proximity) makes it sort of safe in comparrison to a more ne coastal region. The pocket / bay is quite distant from any known seismic zones epicenter. In addition to the infrastructure. You should be fine and well. </p>

<p>If your in a wooden house on the beach. Its likely not so lucky a place to be. So you have advanced knowledge and several safetys in place. Thats something to take comfort in. </p>

<p>My general impression on time was again 7-8 hours. Yet again its the duration of the solar event which is uncommon. So a more effective timeline is likely 18 hours. 
Will be happy to update and correspond (right or wrong). </p>

<p>Mind ya, this is a working theory. So all details help and lead to inherited knowledge. </p>

<p>So if its alright I may say hello again in some time :).</p>

<p>Either way I may call it an early night tonight. (getting clise to midnight and all). Just be sure your not over stressed. Eat well, find a good read etc. I truly doubt that post event much devistation will take place in tokyo. My main area of concern at this time is hitachi. The two 4.5&#39;s in the vicinity make it to be an active area of interest. So I suspect that is the region to likely inhabit this activity. :)</p>

<p>Have a beautiful day all the same. Also sending my love to japan!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Should be sooner then later. Yet again were working on borrowed time. <a href="http://services.swpc.noaa.gov/images/geospace-1-day.png">http://services.swpc.noaa.gov/images/geospace-1-day.png</a></p>

<p>Top graph displays the bz componet. The impression where the two vectors seperate is the initial breaching. Them coming together is the breach contracting to a normal level. Typically we see the event within a day of the phenomena. Yet also typicqlly the breaches are half this size. So I am unsure what that will mean. I consider a longer interval of time inbetween. Vs. A larger then normal eq. (although the time it takes to postulate also reduces the seismic size of the quake). </p>

<p>So I suppose the longer it takes the better off you are. If that makes sense :)</p>

<p>I truly missed ya and hoped you were well. I wanted to emerge sooner but I felt ot was best to take a sort of siesta for a brief moment to relax. Im past it. Truly happy to be surrounded by my friends like you again :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thia is the most sinilar paper ive seen. Although my theory is likely different in a context that its proveable via photograph should the australian array choose to allow me time to test it. 
I need to really read into the article prior to noting any vast differences yet it is a great find. I am very thankful for it :)
Very very :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not worried. 
Just extra precautionary. I am assessing this event to come in a matter of hours. 
If the earthquake comes tokyo is the safest city in japan to be in. 
Count in your head and time the event. If you make it to 4.5 minutes. Make your way to high ground immedieatly. 
(as a precautionary step). </p>

<p>Again tokyo is very safe. 
They went through a 9.0 before with very little structural damages. This should be like a speed bump in that regard. </p>

<p>Technically your just being responsible for the day. With likely more warning then anyone there. </p>

<p>So take a level of comfort in that. Don&#39;t consider it anything less then lucky :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the detailed reply. Is the 18 hour time slot meaning you expect it to happen within the 18 hours, so literally any moment from now on, or to happen IN 18 hours time? Just trying to plan my movements during this time in case something does happen.</p>

<p>Thanks again for your constant updates on this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It isn&#39;t about stopping an earthquake from happening its about the advancement of seismic warning systems. </p>

<p>I am documenting significant arguments which establish a rooted connection to earths largest seismic events and our most complex solar wind patterns. </p>

<p>There is significance in documwnting that relationship regardless of your pessimism. Factually a ocnnection could lead to the very complex journey of devising a smart system. One which operates an algorith which detects the likely probability of an incoming seismic event. Using real time solar weather feeds. </p>

<p>But its not like I am not doing &#39;just that with my life&#39;. </p>

<p>In fact that is exactly what I am doing my life. Carry on-</p>
