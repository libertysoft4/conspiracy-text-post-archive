        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I thought this would be an interesting topic to cover.  When George W Bush was &quot;elected&quot; in 2000, I was only 16 and couldn&#39;t be less interested in global politics and elections and presidents and politics in general other than its basic historical relevance (I&#39;ve always been into history).  That came at a time in my life when I was heavily getting into punk rock and hardcore and the subculture&#39;s history, listening to heavily political, populist-oriented and socially-conscious lyrics from bands like Bad Religion, Propagandhi, Strung Out, Black Flag, Good Riddance, and NOFX.</p>

<p>Through those bands and their interviews I learned about writers and journalists like Noam Chomsky, Howard Zinn, Michael Parenti, Greg Palast, and was fully redpilled into political action and conspiracy by not only Bush&#39;s blatant theft of the 2000 election, but largely from the multimedia section of Propagandhi&#39;s <em>Today&#39;s Empires, Tomorrow&#39;s Ashes</em> CD that had a huge excerpt of William Blum&#39;s seminal works <em>Killing Hope</em> and <em>Rogue State</em>, two books that I think every single person should read if they want to understand just what the United States Military has been up to the past 60 to 70 years.</p>

<p>Point being, I never would have heard of any of this or dived down the rabbit holes that I did if it hadn&#39;t been for the music that inspired me to look into alternative thinking and the questioning of authority that came part and parcel with punk rock/hardcore.  Anyone else have a similar story?  In what ways did music or art inspire you to &quot;wake up&quot; to the realities of the world we live in?</p>

<p>He managed the beastie boys (almost all Jewish), Run DMC, Public Enemy, Will Smith, Jay Z, Kanye, etc. He&#39;s the most influential man in hip hop and he has destroyed the genre as you can see today.</p>

<p>Just look up Lyor Cohen on Youtube and you can see he&#39;s an asshat</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/GSfk0wLs4EE">https://youtu.be/GSfk0wLs4EE</a></p>

<p>I don&#39;t even know how I stumbled upon Immortal Technique, but he has a few woke songs. You can add El-P and his other project Run The Jewels to the mix too. The more I know the more underground woke rap I find. As a younger teen I was heavy into Dead Kennedys, but most of the messages flew over my head. </p>

<p>I&#39;m a firefighter that watched the towers go down while at work. We watched in silent horror for days, never even thinking once that our own &quot;leaders&quot; could be behind it. The somber realization of it being a false flag shook me to my roots, and nothing has been the same for me since. </p>

<p>Are you believing the morning papers?<br/>
War is coming back in style<br/>
There&#39;s generals here, advisers there<br/>
And Russians nibbling everywhere<br/>
The chessboard&#39;s filling up with red<br/>
We make more profits when we blow off their heads<br/>
Economy is looking bad, Let&#39;s start another war (when ya get drafted!)<br/>
Fan the fires of racist hatred, we want total war (when ya get drafted!)  </p>

<p>Drooling fingers, panic buttons<br/>
Playing with missiles like they&#39;re toys<br/>
There&#39;s easy money, easy jobs<br/>
Especially when you build the bombs<br/>
That blow big cities off the map<br/>
Just guess who profits when we build &#39;em back up<br/>
Yeah, what Big Business wants Big Business gets, it wants a war (when ya get drafted!)<br/>
Trilateral Commission goonies laugh and scheme for more (when ya get drafted!)<br/>
Call the Army, call the Navy, stocked with kids from slums (when ya get drafted!)<br/>
If you can&#39;t afford a slick attorney we might make you a spy<br/>
Forget your demonstrations, kids today sit on their ass (when ya get drafted!)<br/>
Just a six-pack and you&#39;re happy we&#39;re prepared for when ya get drafted<br/>
When ya get drafted!  </p>

<p>people completely misunderstand and mischaracterize genX. i don&#39;t think there was ever a more informed, politically minded generation, esp before internet made it easy, but we just saw it all as futile. we&#39;d been told we were going to die any day now from the day we were born, first under a mushroom cloud or via a child molester, then by AIDS. we were born during watergate, watched iraq-contra in junior high, drugs for guns in the college.  we raised ourselves and parented our infantile parents, you can&#39;t do that without being aware about what is going on. also, i think growing up in the most tense decade of the cold war makes everything about the govt, and in our case, how fucking stupid and dangerous the govt was.</p>
