    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m pretty sure they&#39;d just toss out Orangutan cause he&#39;s not really a person is he? I thought he was just kind of a link spamming bot... prolific doesn&#39;t equal popular. It would be sketchy if he made it as a mod, cause he comes off as &quot;fake&quot; to me... I agree with the other mod choices... except that Justin guy... cause I&#39;ve honestly never heard of that dude in my life... at least all the other ones I recognize and respect... although Shell might just be easy to spot cause of the flair. </p>

<p>I think they did a good job with the choices... but they really shouldn&#39;t have claimed that in the end it was science and math that lead to the new mods... should have been like the last round of newbies... the mods are totally within their rights to be like &quot;These are the ones we chose cause they are the ones we wanted.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Blabbering about the rules in an inflammatory topic isn&#39;t the best way to address the rules... especially since you haven&#39;t really quantified any specific grievances or remedies... it just comes across as childish venting due to a perceived slight. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reddit has been in a slow decay for about 4 years now. The moderator infiltration toward a certain agenda just keeps spreading, ever so slowly. It&#39;s almost a shame it doesn&#39;t collapse all at once like digg did when their admins sold out to advertisers, but the compartmentalization of the subreddit system allows it to linger on, for better or worse. That&#39;s why I made my own sub, so I can at least control the moderation. If the reddit admins step in to shut it down, then that&#39;s a whole new thing, but I think that sort of thing has subtly happened before (by the admins forcing mod appointments through various methods). </p>

<p>It&#39;s sad to watch, but it&#39;s also upsetting how slow and subtle it has been, because it means that many people haven&#39;t noticed because it&#39;s so compartmentalized and gradual. </p>

<p>It&#39;s honestly pretty frustrating to watch, and that&#39;s why I decided to actually run for a mod position. </p>

<p>But what happened as a result indicates to me that the spread of controlled moderators is not going to be stopped. It&#39;s a long-term strategy to take over a website that is seen by millions, and then I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if reddit admins are paid to turn a blind eye to this. </p>

<p>You are a valued member of this community. I&#39;d rather not see you get caught up in subreddit drama.
