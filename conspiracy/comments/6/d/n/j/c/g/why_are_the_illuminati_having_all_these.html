    <div class="md"><p>Seriously, how do you get from &quot;immigrants&quot; to &quot;I no longer have a culture&quot; to &quot;I am no longer an individual&quot;?</p>

<p>That doesnt even make any kind of sense, and it comes in place of things that actually matter like actual sex slavery and drug smuggling, and all the interconnections those things imply.
There are <strong>so</strong> many conspiracies <strong>so</strong> much more interesting than goddamn <em>racebaiting</em>. You would think people would respect themselves more than enough to waste their efforts on stuff like this. Anyone who is here is already thinking more than most, they are better than this, they can <strong>do</strong> better than this. Have some self respect for the love of christ. </p>

<p>But I guess we still have to sugarcoat our racism in intrigue before we can talk about anything that actually matters, like US military documents describing encounters with alien spacecraft in the 40s. There is still truth out here. But not all of us have eyes to see it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The fact you think it has to do with race is the issue. Culture is totally separate, most of these immigrants are coming from countries that still punish women for being raped, and still do public beheadings. Sharia law doesn&#39;t mesh with rest of the world is the issue</p>

<p>Like others have said it helps to erode the borders and then also it adds to the number of impoverished dependents who will clamor for communism-lite.  Its about overloading and breaking the system to quadruple down on more of the same.  The &quot;socialists&quot; never had a plan for transitioning a healthy US into &quot;socialism&quot; and so they need to break it first.  Then we can have their &quot;socialism&quot; without any prosperity and the government gets to be the good guys helping out all of the weaponized poor.  Its why assholes like Zuckerberg are now <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mark-zuckerberg-joins-silicon-valley-202800717.html">speaking about UBI</a> (universal basic income), which is just a marketing buzzword for their &quot;socialism&quot;.</p>

Think of what happened to the Native American (minus the disease) the professor turned out the be flaming liberal who spent the majority of his time presenting his work trying to undermine his own results.
