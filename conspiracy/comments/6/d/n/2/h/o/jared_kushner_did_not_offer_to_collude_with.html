    <div class="md"><p>Lower in this comment chain you asked for links saying anyone owed money, I gave you one.  Also, as I said in the first comment, I just went for a site that trump fans wouldnt call fake news, breitbart has a lot of connections to people all around trump so they&#39;re not going to go out of their way to shoot themselves in the foot. But If you look around the internet for other sites on it, there&#39;s more in depth research done about who loaned him the money, and it&#39;s mostly russian banks for the same reason trump gets his loans from there, noone else would give him the money.</p>

<p>Russia needs Trump to repay back the loans. </p>

<p>Russia exposed the corruption at the DNC. </p>

<p>Am I just jaded or biased? I fucking hate Trump&#39;s policies and I always have. I think he&#39;s hilarious and entertaining, but I don&#39;t particular enjoy defending him. However, everything that comes out the dem&#39;s mouths sounds like the dumbest shit I&#39;ve ever heard. </p>

<p>And Kushner is a snake. Who knows what is really going on in his mind. I dunno, I think there is a great deal of fake outs going on, I won&#39;t pretend to know what is real, but I think it is a mistake to take anything these people say at face value.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a great point, as ended up being the case in Clinton&#39;s email deal. But as far as obstruction of justice, does intent really matter? Asking Comey to lay off Flynn, asking Coats and Rogers to state there&#39;s no evidence during the ongoing investigations are serious things even if they find nothing in the end. Trump doesn&#39;t want to be investigated period. </p>

And the investigations are most definitely looking into trumps campaign, and his connections to russia, that&#39;s the entire point of the special investigator.  </p>
