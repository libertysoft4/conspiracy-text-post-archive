<p>He&#39;s failed to lock up the D.C. pedophiles and release 911 info, attacked Syria based on bogus intel, put on a yamuk in israel like a shabas goy bitch, and lined his pockets selling visas to china etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That circlejerk frustrates me to no end. Voat is the same way. These people don&#39;t realize they&#39;re being played in hopes that they will accept the police state, condone foreign war, and hopefully a few of them are even dumb enough to start some kind of violent uprising that would allow for the imposition of martial law.</p>

<p>They spend all their time talking about the dishonest media and &quot;fake news&quot; but they operate under the assumption that the media is 100% trustworthy about literally every detail about every terror event. They stop questioning it as soon as it proffers the opportunity to circlejerk about &quot;muh ebil mudslimes.&quot;</p>

<p>I&#39;m trying over and over again to get them to investigate the details of just <em>one hoax terror event</em> in hopes that it will cast doubt on all others, or at least get them to think critically about the MSM they claim to despise and distrust.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>George W. Bush got in office by stealing the 2000 election. </p>

<p>Sample article: <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/none-dare-call-it-treason/">https://www.thenation.com/article/none-dare-call-it-treason/</a></p>

<p>Then he gave a massive 4.3 trillion dollar tax cut to the rich, ELIMINATING THE SURPLUS ever since.</p>

<p>Then he was away all summer on vacation, not tending to anything but himself (supposedly).</p>

<p>Then, a report commissionbe by Bill Clinton revealed that 2.3 trillion dollars were &quot;unaccounted&quot;: in the Defense Deaprtment. That was September 10.</p>

<p>Then, the great terror attack.</p>

<p>I think it was the very next day that the consortium revealed it&#39;s findings on the vote count in Florida -- by every statewide measure, whatever method was used, Al Gore won the state.</p>

<p>And, if that wasn&#39;t enough, the fall was filled with giant corporate scandals, the anthrax scare, and many deaths of biological scientists....</p>

<p>Ah, I remember it well ... but not fondly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here is the hard fact about the last election, and why the media predicted it all so poorly. The media and DNC are out of touch with the majority of people who don&#39;t live in metropolitan/coastal areas.</p>

<p>This fact still has not changed. The way the polls were done are the same ways they are still being done. You really have no idea how popular Trump is, because the way the media seems to report their own wishful thinking.</p>

<p>Now the real secret about why people voted for Trump was actually as simple as &quot;to piss everyone off.&quot; Trump is VERY consistent at this, so most of his base aren&#39;t going to budge. </p>
