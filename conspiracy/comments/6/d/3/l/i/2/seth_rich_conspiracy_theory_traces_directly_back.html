<p>I feel the same way with all these claims about this being debunked.</p>

<p>The fact that assange went out of his way to mention Seth in relation to sources and the reward he offered is far more compelling than anything I have seen to disprove he was the leaker. </p>

<p>I have said for a bit now that I am not sold on the murder mystery elements of this story though. It sounds like a good plot, but there isn&#39;t anything I find substantial enough to convince me. </p>

<p>But there is one thing glaringly absent from our analysis of the Seth Rich situation. Despite the large number of low-effort submissions around, I have yet to see the one that says:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Written by Mary Rich and Joel Rich on May 23rd:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Still, conservative news outlets and commentators continue, day after painful day, to peddle discredited conspiracy theories that Seth was killed after having provided WikiLeaks with emails from the DNC. Those theories, which some reporters have since retracted, are baseless, and they are unspeakably cruel.</p>

<p>We know that Seth’s personal email and his personal computer were both inspected by detectives early in the investigation and that the inspection revealed no evidence of any communications with anyone at WikiLeaks or anyone associated with WikiLeaks. Nor did that inspection reveal any evidence that Seth had leaked DNC emails to WikiLeaks or to anyone else. Indeed, those who have suggested that Seth’s role as a data analyst at the DNC gave him access to a wide trove of emails are simply incorrect — Seth’s job was to develop analytical models to encourage voters to turn out to vote. He didn’t have access to DNC emails, Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee emails, John Podesta’s emails or Hillary Clinton’s emails. That simply wasn’t his job.</p>

<p>Despite these facts, our family’s nightmare persists. Seth’s death has been turned into a political football. Every day we wake up to new headlines, new lies, new factual errors, new people approaching us to take advantage of us and Seth’s legacy. It just won’t stop. The amount of pain and anguish this has caused us is unbearable. With every conspiratorial flare-up, we are forced to relive Seth’s murder and a small piece of us dies as more of Seth’s memory is torn away from us.</p>

<p>Even if  they were told all this, which sounds like a really odd  detail to share with the family of a grown man who has an on going murder investigation, that presumes he didn&#39;t have access through an &#39;alternative&#39; means.

    <div class="md"><p>The fact remains that Seth Rich was murdered and those who did it are on the loose.  The suspicious part is that nobody but Wikileaks seem to be interested in finding out who did it and why.</p>

<p>What&#39;s more interesting is that Wikileaks has no vested interest in who did it except for what it would expose.  No other reason for them to be the ONLY entity that offered up a reward for information.</p>

<p>That is completely untrue. The DC police have offered $25,000:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Police distributed updated flyers in the neighborhood Thursday that noted that the reward for information is up to $25,000.</p>

Reclaim New York not only featured Bannon but it currently directed by the Mercer sisters, and if you believe the claims of Mercer colleagues in Jane Mayer&#39;s New Yorker piece on Mercer, he fully buys into the &quot;Clinton Kill List.&quot; This was an engineered propaganda event from start to finish. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Written by Mary Rich and Joel Rich on May 23rd:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Still, conservative news outlets and commentators continue, day after painful day, to peddle discredited conspiracy theories that Seth was killed after having provided WikiLeaks with emails from the DNC. Those theories, which some reporters have since retracted, are baseless, and they are unspeakably cruel.</p>

<p>We know that Seth’s personal email and his personal computer were both inspected by detectives early in the investigation and that the inspection revealed no evidence of any communications with anyone at WikiLeaks or anyone associated with WikiLeaks. Nor did that inspection reveal any evidence that Seth had leaked DNC emails to WikiLeaks or to anyone else. Indeed, those who have suggested that Seth’s role as a data analyst at the DNC gave him access to a wide trove of emails are simply incorrect — Seth’s job was to develop analytical models to encourage voters to turn out to vote. He didn’t have access to DNC emails, Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee emails, John Podesta’s emails or Hillary Clinton’s emails. That simply wasn’t his job.</p>

<p>Despite these facts, our family’s nightmare persists. Seth’s death has been turned into a political football. Every day we wake up to new headlines, new lies, new factual errors, new people approaching us to take advantage of us and Seth’s legacy. It just won’t stop. The amount of pain and anguish this has caused us is unbearable. With every conspiratorial flare-up, we are forced to relive Seth’s murder and a small piece of us dies as more of Seth’s memory is torn away from us.</p>
