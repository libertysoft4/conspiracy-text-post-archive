        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Sandy Hook was a staged event carried out by child murdering pedophilia cults that have infiltrated aspects of the government and media and were backed up by the human trafficking Italian Mafia and paramilitary death squads. Sandy Hook was used as type of litmus test to sort out those that reject the official story and speak out. Those who spoke out against Sandy Hook&#39;s official story have been put on a list for persecution and execution. The fake story was the bait and the internet is the hook used for catching those that speak out. Anyone that looks into Sandy Hook can see the inconsistencies, flaws, and suspicious details. Realizing that members of the government and media were involved in carrying out a staged mass shooting of 20 children is shocking. Many immediately turn to cognitive dissonance to deal with this realization. Those initiated in secret societies were in on it and there are millions in the United States that are initiated into secret societies.</p>

<p>The fact is that the US government has legalized information programs through the NDAA with the intent for international use through their Voice of America (VOA) broadcasting network makes the media legalized liars that cannot be trusted. The VOA reported on Sandy Hook. The media&#39;s immediate response to Sandy Hook was disarmament of citizens. It is logical that a tyrannical government would seek to disarm citizens and go as far as staging mass shootings to do obtain their objective. Since it was the death of 20 children this makes it a sensitive subject. The reality is that the US government has murdered millions of children through trade sanctions, war, and hellfire missiles and they do not even deny this. Those involved with the Sandy Hook story signed national security contracts, were paid mostly through charitable organizations, and are members of secret societies involved in pedophilia and human sacrifice.</p>

<p>Some inconsistencies include Robbie Parker smiling on video less than 24 hours after his daughter was brutally murdered as the media reported, the death certificate released through the Freedom of Information Act that states Adam Lanza died the day before Sandy Hook occurred and in New Hampshire, the strange behavior from the coroner, green screen used by CNN during an interview with one of the victims parents, doctored photos of Adam Lanza, and many other details. The inconsistencies were intentional and the bait. Motives involving Sandy Hook include disarmament for enslavement, pay offs or greed, murdering those that speak out, and most of all for enabling human trafficking and pedophilia. Many came out strongly in defense of the story as if they were there and many of them are paid or more than likely pedophiles part of this larger agenda.</p>

<p>The Lanza family are a Sicilian nobility and hold many titles through out Sicily to this day. Today Prince Pietro Lanza di Scalea is the head of the Sicilian Lanza family. The Sicilian Mafia are involved in human trafficking. The Hollywood movies that glorify gangsters as if they have some moral code is propaganda. The mafia are the most ruthless and despicable group on the planet. Ryan Lanza moved to New Jersey where the Italian Mafia have major influences over. It appears that Ryan Lanza helped to create the fake identity of Adam Lanza while residing in the town of Sandy Hook. Jeff Lanza is a retired FBI agent from Connecticut and this suggests the Lanza family have infiltrated the FBI. The private investigator Wolfgang Halbig while speaking with a woman on video mention the Italian Mafia threatening them. I have been threatened many times for speaking out against Sandy Hook myself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good write up. The Sicilian mafia abide by certain honour codes and killing children (or pretending to have children killed) doesn&#39;t really fit their &quot;style of doing business&quot;.</p>

<p>However, the US government and media were definitely in cahoots regarding Sandy Hook, but the missing element in your analysis was the involvement of the secret societies - Rosicrucians and Freemasonry.</p>

<p>This post of mine from a couple of years&#39; ago reveals a very direct link I discovered between The Georgia Guidestones, the Capitol and Sandy Hook Elementary School. The Guidestones are literally pointers, showing things to those who are able and willing to look. And if you look even harder you will find an owl connection between the three also.</p>

<p>Nancy Lanza had no income at the time the marriage was legally dissolved, in September 2009. Her ex-husband, Peter Lanza, earned an annual salary of nearly $445,000 as an executive at General Electric and agreed to pay annual alimony of $240,000. That figure was scheduled to increase steadily for cost of living considerations, and Nancy Lanza was due to receive $289,800 in 2012, court records show. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I positively remember there being much more information available on his part in the scandal/ge and how he was being used as an almost scape goat by the company. In the year or so after Sandy hook, I remember showing links/stories to friends to show them how weird it was..now you Google him all you see is that it was a rumor...whatever it was it was certainly a sticky situation. Peter lanza was in some shady deals with shadier people, saw a way to save his own ass and get rid of a bitch ex wife(240k for alimony my gawd) and queer son so went for it.</p>

<p>I remember Sandy hook happening, and remember doing my own research into it. It stunk from the start, with all the news stories not the same on what guns/how many shooters etc. Witnesses seeing men run into the woods, it was just a shitshow. The only strong point they had was that if it was true, it was too horrible to doubt cause it was <em>children</em>. I always look into who any perpetrator&#39;s family was, and there was tons on Peter. He WAS going to trial, but it all disappeared after the &quot;tragedy&quot;. Just like the trillion$ the Pentagon didn&#39;t have to answer for after 9/11. False flag to get what they want, sweep some dirt under the rug, move on. It&#39;s bogus, and it&#39;s what they do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have researched Sandy Hook for hundreds of hours.  There is 100% no doubt that it was a completely staged psyop (by the Government, DHS, etc), and no children died.</p>

<p>What I find very significant about your post is that you say that the Establishment drops enough &quot;inconsistencies&quot; so that they <em>intentionally</em> want the smartest people in the population to find out that the story was a hoax -- in order to identify them and put them on lists for future persecution/etc.  I also believe that to be true.  Nevertheless, I am not afraid and will continue to speak out. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great post here, but I would disagree on the hierarchy - the Jews/Khazars are subservient to the Vatican/Jesuits.  The Babylonian Talmudists that infiltrated the three major religions and created the political doctrine of Zionism are the same descendants of the mystery schools and Saturnalian cults that intermarried with European royalty and created the Black Nobility, the true Elite.  Even the Rothschilds and other banking families are ultimately subservient to these people.  The &quot;Jews&quot; are ultimately being used as the scapegoats for Elites to further inflame sentiment against them in order to further their eventual goal of the destruction of all three Abrahamic religions.</p>

I remember so many people went after the family&#39;s of the 2 gunmen. Perhaps kids and teachers actually died but what the average person saw was all faked. Perhaps the media has to stage the event (pictures, all those kids waking out of the school, the staged ambulances from the videos) in order to keep the actual families that lost loved one safe.

    <div class="md"><p>Well, the photos they circulated of &quot;Adam&quot; (pre Sandy Hook) are the same person as those circulated as &quot;Ryan&quot;, post Sandy Hook. They weren&#39;t ever photographed together, which is telling.

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t say the whole thing isn&#39;t sketch. I don&#39;t believe Lanza did it at all. He was setup. But nothing you say proves he didn&#39;t exist at all. </p>

<p>Death Certificate the day before his death: He could of been killed the day before, and had his body dumped at the scene. I&#39;d be interested to see that death certificate as well.</p>

<p>And on the topic of inconsistencies in regards to Ryan Lanza, it is really strange, but in no way points to Adam not existing. I&#39;m not sure if you remember the coverage during the immediate aftermath, but originally the media was claiming that the shooter WAS Ryan Lanza. They quickly took that back. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;&quot;Sandy Hook was a staged event carried out by child murdering pedophilia cults&quot;&quot;</p>

<p>A few years ago I was debating someone on here about where all the children went of it was staged. I offered the theory that we are dealing with child trafficking victims. I believe it was around the time of the FF news reporter shooting. Which I was also theorizing with someone that much like the mafia grooms young people our government could be too with assassins or political actors. Much like Russia&#39;s sleeper agents. </p>

<p>An as I was typing all this I started to wonder if the parents themselves are not child victims who have grown an been groomed for certain actions. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am have a theory that it could be possible that the parent are victims themselves who have grown up in it. So compliance is easy when it is all you have known since your kidnapping. At the same time it should not be crazy to think that there are families that have children indoctrinated an brainwashed since birth to be loyal actors of the state. Much like Russia&#39;s sleeper families or when a gangster grooms their child or  another to be their protege. </p>
