        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Trump was friends with all these politicians and people for decades before hand.  He knew all of it.  Seth Rich stumbles onto something and leaks it to Wikileaks and is murdered by DNC.  Obama illegally wiretaps Trump tower and trump campaign.  WL planned to release the pizzagate stuff on Hillary and expose Podesta and Hillary had she won the election.  Instead Trump won.  </p>

<p>So all these forces are converging on Trump.  All these agencies.  Trump and Mueller talk the night before Mueller takes office.  Mueller tells him he is on his side.  </p>

<p>I think all of this was an elaborate way to get Hillary, Podesta and the Awans.  </p>

<p>Mueller and the FBI and CIA know it all.  They know about CPP and the Awans and have for awhile.  </p>

<p>This was all an elaborate way to drain the swamp.  </p>

<p>Manafort flipped and gave info to Mueller.  </p>

<p>Mueller is on our side</p>

<p>Julian has now tweeted it:</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/JulianAssange/status/901256135000436737">https://twitter.com/JulianAssange/status/901256135000436737</a></p>

<p>The point is the lead is buried. Podesta Group being subpoenaed doesnt fit in with the Trump is in bed with Putin narrative.  Interestingly this all may uncover what we all knew anyways which is the exact opposite:  Hillary and the DNC&#39;s ties to Russian Uranian deals</p>

<p>&quot;Paul Manafort was a plant. He was never with Trump, he was trying to get dirt on him to bring it back to Hilary, this is why he got removed from the campaign and why the FBI raided his house.
Trump pardoned him though, in return for more information Manafort has on the rest of the DNC and corrupt assholes.&quot;</p>

<p>The important question is why does a team assembled under the mandate to investigate foreign influence in the 2016 elections seem to be less of a panel of election law experts and more of a legal hit team assembled to tear to pieces an international crime ring stuffed to the brim with expertise in financial, corruption, terrorism, and white collar crimes?</p>
