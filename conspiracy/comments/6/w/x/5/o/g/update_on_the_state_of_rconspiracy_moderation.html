        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Because of our commitment to transparency, it&#39;s important for the health of this sub that all moderator activity can be held to the highest standards and utmost scrutiny.</p>

<p>That being said, the very divisive nature of &quot;conspiracy theories&quot; in general has understandably contributed to a dramatically contentious environment here at <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, from which the moderating team certainly isn&#39;t immune.</p>

<p>This sub has seen its fair share of drama over the years, and for those who may have missed the latest installment, <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6w5eah/regarding_the_upheaval_on_the_mod_team_last/?utm_content=comments&amp;amp;utm_medium=front&amp;amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;amp;utm_name=conspiracy">here&#39;s an overview regarding the &quot;recent upheaval&quot;.</a></p>

<p>The result of this &quot;upheaval&quot; initially led to the removal of dronepuppet and the resignation of flytape, and culminated today in admin intervention to remove sarah_connor.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago, S_C made the concerning decision to remove the permissions of the rest of the team, a decision that the admins promptly reversed.</p>

<p>The admins have made it clear that any moderator who acts unilaterally and attempts to undermine the subreddit by removing all of their co-mods poses a problem. </p>

<p>An unmoderated sub (even for a short period of time) could be subject to doxx or other posts that would then be unable to be removed.</p>

<p>Instead of heeding the advice of the admins, S_C took further drastic action a few days ago by <em>removing</em> the rest of the mod team, compelling the admins to act again.</p>

<p>Because S_C forced the hand of the admins on two occasions, the rest of the mods unanimously decided that demoting S_C from the top (active) position was prudent, thus preventing further issues that would jeopardize the future of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.</p>

<p>It&#39;s important to note that the <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> mod team only voted to <em>demote</em> sarah_connor (not demod).</p>

<p>Unfortunately, S_C refused these conditions, and at this point we reached out to the admins.</p>

<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6w5eah/regarding_the_upheaval_on_the_mod_team_last/dm5mg7k/">Although S_C claimed to have been acting</a> in the best interest of the sub, <a href="https://archive.is/t06Cc">the timeline of events suggests otherwise</a>, for not only were my permissions removed and the rest of the team removed as mods, only two were then re-added (dronepuppet and flytape).</p>

<p>In the best case scenario, this was a misguided attempt to restructure the mod team (and in the worst, an attempted coup). Regardless of motive, it was the wrong decision.</p>

<p>Veteran mods of several years had their counters unnecessarily reset to 0, and the sub was exposed to precisely the type of vulnerability that the admins warned us against.</p>

<p>To summarize, here&#39;s a brief rundown of events:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>About a month ago, we noticed that ex-mod dronepuppet (DP) had approved several new and potentially suspicious accounts. When DP was asked for an explanation, his behavior was even more suspicious and our questions went largely unanswered. </p></li>
<li><p>Soon after, and ostensibly in the face of increasing tension among the mod team, SC decided to deperm the entire team and the admins had to step in to restore us all, while chastising SC and (politely) warning us to not let that happen anymore. </p></li>
<li><p>The mods unanimously voted to demote SC to a lower position on the team, which SC seemed to consider.</p></li>
<li><p>DP admitted to using alts and offered some obscure justification, and the rest of the mods began talks to have him removed for suspicious behavior and repeatedly ignoring our questions.</p></li>
<li><p>A few days ago, SC decided to demod the rest of the team and invited only DP and flytape back. They both accepted and flytape stickied an announcement about &quot;restructuring&quot; the mod team.</p></li>
<li><p>Admins then reversed the removals and depermed SC, prompting flytape to resign in protest and our decision to finalize the vote to remove DP.</p></li>
<li><p>We repeatedly offered SC a chance to simply be demoted to a lower position on the team, with today as the deadline. </p></li>
<li><p>SC doubled down and we appealed to the admins for his removal.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Further details about all of these events can certainly be provided.</p>

<p>As things settle down, the <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> mod team will be uttering a sigh of relief, as it&#39;s clearly in the best interest of the sub to simply move forward.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t hesitate to share any thoughts or suggestions regarding the future of the sub, and that includes all manners of healthy criticism!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you make a very good point here. Regardless of how you feel about the state of this sub at this moment, Reddit, Inc. has complete control over whatever happens on this site. Even if their motives are currently benign, and I don&#39;t believe they are, there&#39;s nothing to guarantee they will be in the future. </p>

<p>I think we should all be thinking about and working toward alternative models to the centralized discussion forum platform that reddit and other previous sites have been based on. A decentralized platform would be better (e.g. Mastodon, though it does have issues) or better yet fully distributed (I&#39;ve not yet seen any viable candidate). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I think I made a post here (might have been another sub) about the project Barret Brown was working on, can&#39;t remember the name off the top of my head. The project seemed to be more about using webs of trust to pull information in citizen journalism than a discussion forum per se, but a forum or similar could be built off on top of it. It was still in alpha when I made the post. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The wrongdoing isn&#39;t that they had right wing beliefs but that they were moderating this place like T_D with bans for having liberal beliefs and using alt accounts to shitpost and upvote each other just like T_D.</p>

<p>T_D is a constant campaign rally for a right leaning politician. Conspiracy is a place for discussion of conspiracies and news that we can&#39;t discuss elsewhere.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know about you, but I don&#39;t see a shred of discussion happening on T_D and this sub has been quickly going to shit over the last few months with the T_D dudes in the mods. Good riddance.</p>

<p>Speaking of, PSA from the past: If we&#39;re in a 100,000 strong mob and you&#39;re going to sack the state, don&#39;t listen to them if they tell you to meet them in a stadium for negotiations. They&#39;ll Justinian you. </p>

<p>The fact that you as a mod here are continuously using the term &quot;right wing&quot;, and &quot;right wing fashion&quot; make me very skeptical of your motives. This sub used to rise above the entire left-right paradigm, and understand that this divide and conquer tactic is detrimental to open and honest discourse.</p>

<p>Believe me, I&#39;m absolutely no fan of FlyTape. He banned me for calling him out on the whole podcast fiasco.  I&#39;ve butted heads with him many times. But your seemingly inability to view this sub in an nonpartisan way, really does a disservice to this wonderful sub.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>SC was not right wing, that is ridiculous.</p>

<p>What it was is SC and flytape had a long relationship and agreed on the nature of the problem we had here. SC was gone 99% of the time, so when they popped in and saw what a shitshow the sub had become, they probably asked the user they had the most experience with what was going on, which was flytape. And we know where flytape stood on this.</p>

<p>We both know how disconnected SC is. I doubt they even have a coherent political position. Quit trying to fuel this bullshit right left conflict that keeps getting pushed around here. We have plenty of totally organic not suspicious at all users to do that. </p>

<p>This is the most disappointing thing I have read in this whole thread. We should not be taking political positions even if we have them. </p>

I&#39;m not ready to condemn or even speak to SC&#39;s motives, but I do think he showed poor judgement and failed to respect the democratic process our mod team operates under. Up until today, I would have accepted him merely taking a lower position on the mod team, which was the decision the mod team made and he agree to, but he continually said he would take a lower position and then reneged on that promise. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s all very strange. I&#39;m not sure what prompted all this really. From what I&#39;ve seen, the only sub manipulations and open bias on repeated display were exhibited by Flytape, and potentially dronepuppet by using alts and approving obvious troll posters. If this was their way of trying to maintain non-partisanship here, it sure didn&#39;t come off that way.</p>

<p>I&#39;m curious if there&#39;s a plan to place to deal with users who&#39;ve barely been around reddit but are currently racking up 10, 20 posts per day on this sub. Regardless of context or observable agenda, this is fishy behavior. </p>

<p>There is no plan in place at this moment, though we have been discussing it. It&#39;s not against any of our rules, and we&#39;re reticent to add any rules that would limit the free flow of information on this sub. Do you have any suggestions?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I suggested a cap on posts a given user can submit per day. Maybe something really generous like 15 to start. But yeah, any limits can be argued to be censorship, even if these aim to thwart the gumming up of /new and karma farming that occurs here every day. It&#39;s kind of a conundrum.

<p>As for the admin team &quot;favoring&quot; the current mods, I don&#39;t know that&#39;s entirely accurate. I expect the admins do want stability, and SC removed the ability of the mod team to moderate twice in as many weeks. The admins did not &quot;pick&quot; the current team; we voted as a team for them to remove SC after we gave him many chances to voluntarily demote himself, and which he agreed to multiple times without following through. </p>

If we are willing to honestly discuss what is concerning about a particular user, then we should be free to do so. The moderators shouldn&#39;t stand in the way.

I think I tried to explain some of the phenomenon there. What are your thoughts on that post? We also have Gentleman&#39;s Guide to Forum Spies on the sidebar, but most people probably won&#39;t see that unless they&#39;re specifically looking. I wouldn&#39;t be opposed to voting to sticky another piece on the presence of shilling, though. </p>

<p>Part of that is drooling rule 10.</p>

<p>I assume you mean dropping? I&#39;m not sure how much good that would do. I can only see every thread filled with people accusing each other of being shills, and actual arguments for or against a particular proposition just being lost. That said, I&#39;m not opposed to doing a one or two week trial of suspending rule 10 just to see what the actual effect is. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t have a simple solution, that&#39;s why I asked if you had one.  To start with, it isn&#39;t possible to identify with certainty who&#39;s a shill and who isn&#39;t, and because of that it greatly limits what we can do.</p>

<p>often disputes come up regarding subs. the admins response has simply been &quot;make a new sub&quot; if you dont like how one is run. </p>

<p>there is no reason the old mods shouldnt keep this sub, and the new ones can make <a href="/r/conspiracy2">/r/conspiracy2</a> or <a href="/r/conspiracy3">/r/conspiracy3</a> or whatever, and users can pick whichever they prefer, or sub to both, or neither.</p>

<p>as someone else so perfectly stated, the admins spezed the modlist. what happened here was complete and total fuckery, period. </p>

<p>If there is any lesson to be learned here, its that if you run a sub the admins dont like, dont wipe the modlist all at once. the smart thing to do is replace one person a week, or one person a month until you have a fresh roster. fuck, if I ran a big sub, i would constantly have people on rotation just to prevent anyone being there too long.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can we get a sticky or sidebar link identifying when each moderator was first added to the team? I think this information needs to be more visible.  </p>

<p>Obviously a moderator who was just added in November shouldn&#39;t get a vote equivalent to a moderator who has been here for years. What is the point of having ranked permissions if the new guys can just vote the old mods out?  </p>

<p>If I had a vote on the matter, I would have suggested starting fresh by removing any mods that have been added for the first time in the last year. Media Matters for America has been wreaking havoc on the internet for nearly two years, and we should be extremely wary of the possibility that we let them vote some shills into the mod team. </p>

<p>yes, by cancerous admins. this is the issue. they should have left him alone, let new mods leave and make a new sub if they wanted to. the original sub creator should be free to add/remove mods as they deem necessary.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah on second thought I think I see what you were talking about.  Kind of a weird consideration I haven&#39;t thought of before, but if I am, for example, having a 12th birthday party, and my mother gets me a birthday card, I can look at that card and be sure I&#39;m 12. But if I then take the card and throw it in the trash, how would I know how old I am. Am I now 0 years old again?  Am I now a newborn?  </p>

But when the_donald roared onto the scene on reddit r/conspiracy seems to be a subreddit the handlers took a liking to and it got political fast. The, in my opinion, inorganic rise of the alt right on reddit is largely what lead to me beginning to actively comment on reddit because I felt like I had to fight propaganda.

<p>this imho seems more like a shady anti-fa like tactic where a left winger poses as a right winger just to stir up shit.</p>

<p>That&#39;s certainly a good question, and something we&#39;ll undoubtedly be discussing in the coming days and weeks. Do you have any suggestions?</p>

<p>I would say that there is pretty much universal if not unanimous support among the mod team for <a href="/u/axolotl_peyotl">/u/axolotl_peyotl</a>. He has managed to avoid showing any partisanship or impulsive behavior for at least as long as I&#39;ve known him, and that&#39;s more than could be said for SC even before recent events. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good point. I do have a question regarding combat of perceived &quot;shills&quot; from both sides of the aisle. Can we establish a rule preventing automated or paid activity? Sure it&#39;ll be ignored but It would give us a valid outlet to report the issue in the rare cases evidence pops up proving either of those things. Just a thought thanks</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If actual evidence of being paid to post here, including admission, comes up, we will ban with prejudice. You&#39;ll have to ask the rest of the mods if this has ever happened, but I seem to recall hearing that it has. </p>

<p>Regarding automated posters, I&#39;d be willing to explore the possibility of creating a rule to prohibit it. But again, finding actual instances will be rare. I suspect most of the automated behavior is done on voting, and we as mods simply don&#39;t have the tools to detect it. Even in instances where we have strong evidence that a post or comment has been artificially upvoted, we can&#39;t prove the commenter was actually responsible, and in many cases, I suspect they are not. </p>

<p>And while the r-politic maniacs blatantly manipulate and brigade the scores, they yell &quot;t_d is brigading&quot; as loudly and as often as they can.</p>

<p>Its a fucking shit show. Just look at this subreddit now, congrats. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Another interesting move they&#39;ve started doing (brilliant really) is trying to frame Trump as &quot;the establishment&quot;, therefore anything said about him that isn&#39;t negative can be met with &quot;You&#39;re going to defend the ESTABLISHMENT??!?!&quot;</p>

<p>Like, yea sure, he&#39;s the President... but the ESTABLISHMENT are the ones who control the MSM, and do nothing but non-stop shit on him every minute of every day.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I&#39;ve been seeing that shit too. You bring up establishment and they say he&#39;s literally establishment. </p>

<p>But you and I both know still that both sides of the aisle hate trump. So while is part of the govt, he&#39;s also an outsider. These career politicians all have dirt  on them. I think that&#39;s a lot of what PG is about, these ratty politicians want money and power so they get blackmailed. Trump never went through that initiation and doesn&#39;t need the establishment so that are trying to beat him into submission. </p>

<p>I refer to it as the deep state now in these cases because we know the deep state is against trump, or was so long as he didn&#39;t go along with their wars. They are warming up to him now a bit I think though. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think this CtR/ShareBlue is genius though. They are just talking to themselves. We know who the shills are just by the content of their message. Or the dupes who tout the same corporate narratives you find on CNN. They are flooding these posts and downvote brigading yet you and I can still talk and just ignore the riff raff if needed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea I guess it&#39;s officially a lost cause. You can battle them all you want, and the most you can hope for is to at least stay in the positives (while the person you&#39;re arguing has 40+ upvotes).</p>

<p>It&#39;s all an effort to control the narrative for people that don&#39;t come here often though. They know that their tactics aren&#39;t working on us, but they don&#39;t give a shit because we&#39;re not the people that they want to manipulate.

    <div class="md"><p>Indeed, I suppose I would say if given the chance again I would vote Bernie.</p>

<p>But yes, on the whole there is a wide diversity of political opinions (there are still mods who lean right on the team, as there are mods who lean left and even some mods who don&#39;t have a political opinion with regards the USA in any direction).</p>

<p>I did get the sense that the folks who leaned hard right on the mod team felt threatened (which is weird, as no mod ever even brought up removing flytape from the team and, in fact, most of his co-mods very much appreciated the perspective he brought to a wide-range of issues related to the subreddit and otherwise), but that group of mods were also trying to advocate censorship of topics that they didn&#39;t like and such for the past few months, as they felt the subreddit shouldn&#39;t allow discussion of any conspiracies that the MSM promulgates. </p>

<p>Personally, I always take any conspiracy orientated theme of MSM&#39;s coverage as an indication that there is perhaps more going on than meets the eye (in the sense that the &quot;conspiracy&quot; the MSM is highlighting is probably a distraction from the root issue in some way), but I think it undermines the very hexis of this subreddit when a moderator suggests banning entire topics of discussion on those grounds.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One thing I&#39;ve noticed in threads is that &quot;a side&quot; is more likely to enter and upvote a thread when they like the news. For example, Trump says something stupid and r/worldnews has a thread on it? Lots of upvotes to anti-Trump comments. A group of black teenagers kidnap and torture a white dude with what appear to be mental issue? Tons of pro-Trump comments. Basically, people show up when their biases are confirmed. Go into the thread about the FBI not releasing Hillary&#39;s emails to see this in action.</p>

<p>I understand what they were doing. That doesn&#39;t make it any more intelligent or effective. They saw a fire, decided that the way to fight it would be to build another fire right next to it, we&#39;re supposed to trust their intentions when instead of putting it out they damn near burned down the sub? </p>

<p>T_D is a proud echo chamber in which dissent against the most powerful administration in the world is not permitted. Any long-time user of this sub would know that this culture is diametrically opposed to ours, which celebrates free thought and suspicion of authority. Yet Flytape did everything possible to import them here and create a safe space.</p>

<p>This is the one sub that should know better than any other the dangers of divide and conquer. But everything they did was the worst possible thing to foster productive discourse, and the best possible thing to ensure that every issue is drowned out by a useless right v left slapfight.    </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m an egalitarian humanist.  Hard to believe given my history, but I think all humans are essentially clones and all ego is illusion.  I find the polarization of politics annoying and distracting from the truth.  I thought this sub was even attempting to even physically resemble the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ussCHoQttyQ">perfectly neutral race from Futurama</a>, but recently most comment sections start with &quot;oh please, John Oliver debunked this last week...&quot;  and it gets a ton of upvotes.  The smell of Brock and agenda have been lurking in all news-related subs lately.</p>

<p>I suppose politically I&#39;m a progressive.  I believe in taking care of others more than yourself and that money can&#39;t buy you true, lasting happiness.  I think that rich people are trying to replace love and acceptance with money.  But I&#39;ve been pushed Right from my squishy center by obnoxious, moralizing, virtue-signaling shills on the Left.</p>

<p>There was a stupid thread recently with a carry-over from /pol/ breaking down the format of John Oliver&#39;s show and how the beats in it are designed to prevent critical thinking.  It was very well thought out and presented, but top comment of course is something to the effect of &quot;oh please, must be another Alex Jones bot.  Go back to T_D, cuck&quot;  It was like I was in /politics, where I am mercifully still banned and not tempted to engage with those Morlocks. </p>

<p>Long story short I can see why Rightwing truthers like Flytape have been pushed away.  I also look forward to his sub taking off.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While I can&#39;t really speak about any of the other mods, DronePuppet was definitely up to some shady shit and needed to go. He was running at least two alt accounts that he was using to troll users and flood &quot;contest mode&quot; threads with off topic top level comments. Remember MAGABolt? That account was almost certainly run by DronePuppet. He approved the account, he ignored all reports on the account, he banned people who responded to the account negatively, and he unbanned the account TWICE after other mods tried to remove it. The same thing happened a month or so before that with another troll account. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>but I think it&#39;s been pretty clear from many mods writing here that his political leanings were obviously provoking them alongside his actions. To assume that his partisanship was completely out of control and not put that same attention into the converse means they created a power vacuum of sorts. I know that all the mods are not &#39;bad guys&#39;, but when the response to these things is handled like it was, there is a shift in balance that is not organic and that can lead to fuckery. I think that&#39;s what people are slightly perturbed about - there&#39;s no argument that DP and flytape acted in a way that doesn&#39;t allow them to continue as mods in this subreddit, but to think they were not somehow provoked into such a desperate action is also foolhardy in my opinion. What kind of environment is resulting from this shift which came from the reddit admins and not directly from the community? We can&#39;t know until we see it play out, but it&#39;s got about half the sub worried. That&#39;s how divide and conquer works - you&#39;re always going to be letting down half the group.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, in a fight, with nothing at stake, honor is what you decide on between each other. Said another way, turnabout is fair play. There is no &quot;think&quot; about it; just go to ShareBlue&#39;s website. You want me to give you a handful of shill accts I killed? Or, we could go read any number of articles about advertising on reddit, influence marketing, and MSM bias. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes yes, I know all about your brave shill hunts. I also know that you sent phishing links to a whole bunch of normal Reddit users and creamed your pants when it said they were all using Amazon servers. Nevermind the fact that it was Reddit&#39;s spam filter triggering your link. Now I won&#39;t argue against the fact that there are shills on Reddit. No one can argue against that. But I don&#39;t go around accusing every user who has a different view than me of being a shill. What I do is find concrete evidence and send it to the mods. Like I did when DronePuppet was using alt accounts to harass users, disrupt discussions, push an agenda, and break subreddit rules. </p>

<p>Getting called a shill is bound to happen if you are a real person and also parrot the accepted narrative. Don&#39;t take it personally. Honestly, I don&#39;t know how they didn&#39;t see this coming. If this keeps going how it is, no one at all will trust. I have even been called a shill once, for telling people to wait until Sunday for GoT and not download it illegally. lol It just happens. </p>

<p>As far as how I know who shills and how much and what their goals are? Loooots of diggin. Our enemies, in order, are Eglin AFB, Israeli college kids; ShareBlue; other influence marketers; and lastly, corporate advertisers. </p>

<p>At first I was completely against the removal but then <a href="/u/AssuredlyAThrowaway">/u/AssuredlyAThrowaway</a> and I conversed and I became less skeptical but seeing how some of the mods that are only two months old are using misdirection on the thread on TMOR I&#39;m beginning to question this again.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In terms of that TMOR thread, I think amos just misinterpreted what SC was trying to say when he said &quot;he got a 403 error trying to contact the topminds mods&quot;.</p>

<p>If you get a username mention on reddit, and it is from a sub in which you are banned, you can type a reply to the comment. However, when you go to hit the send button reddit will give you a site (403) error. This is reddit&#39;s (bad) way of telling you that you can&#39;t reply to the username mention because you are banned.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t mean this disrespectfully to Sarah (as I think he is on mobile so it makes it hard to type sometimes I imagine), but if you&#39;ve been following along with some of his comments in modmail and in some threads, he can be quite hard to understand sometimes. </p>

<p>I believe that is where the issue came from, as Amos was only worried that SC was colluding with TMOR mods as that is how Amos read the interaction. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It would be really decent of Amos to clarify and retract that accusation, then. It was obvious in the TMoR thread that the 403 error was caused by SC being banned. SC was pinged and went there to defend the sub and couldn&#39;t respond because of the ban. The mod in the thread admitted that he had just lifted the bans on the mods.

</blockquote>

<p><strong>I do not retract my demand for explanation</strong>. The evidence is not a &quot;smoking gun&quot;, but it is very compelling. I am more than happy to clarify.</p>

<p>First, some background: TMoR was literally created (as a spin-off of r/Conspiratard) to mock and attack this sub, and if possible, have it removed from Reddit. When it began, this sub was virtually their ONLY target. Only later did they start attacking T_D and others on a regular basis.</p>

<p>No one knew of this ongoing enmity better than u/Sarah_Connor - who had been a mod here since 2009. <em>(or should I say the</em> <strong><em>account</em></strong> <em>known as u/Sarah_Connor - as it may have been sold, or otherwise compromised during that mysterious 1 year period of total inactivity.)</em></p>

<p>TMoR <strong><em>constantly</em></strong> harasses and mocks the mods and users of this sub. Multiple threads every day. It happens so often that we pay them no more mind than we would a car passing on a nearby freeway. So why would S_C give a shit about what they said <em>this</em> time?</p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/8fMrMUE.png">Here is a snapshot of Sarah_Connor history.</a> </p>

<p>It shows a total of 4 (FOUR) comments in TopMindsofReddit. <strong><em>Three</em></strong> of these four are in the &quot;apology&quot; thread referenced below.</p>

<p>As yourself: Why, <strong><em>on this particular occasion</em></strong>,  would S_C feel compelled to <em>defensively answer</em> after being &quot;called out&quot; by TMoR - for <em>failing</em> to purge the mod team - and in a sub that was founded to attack and destroy <a href="/r/Conspiracy">/r/Conspiracy</a> - effectively telling them <em>&quot;Hey, I tried, but the admins stepped in! It wasn&#39;t my fault, so fuck you!&quot;</em></p>

<p>Excerpts: (emphasis mine)</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>Moranall</strong>: u/sarah_connor, you had your chance to do something [about this](np.reddit.com<a href="/r/conspiracy/comments/6svm0i/all_mods_are_on_recess_for_an_internal_discussion/">/r/conspiracy/comments/6svm0i/all_mods_are_on_recess_for_an_internal_discussion/</a>)</p>

<p><strong>Sarah_Connor</strong>: You area fucking moron. <strong>Admins intervened</strong> - so go fuck yourself.</p>

<p><strong>Moranall</strong>: I&#39;m trying to be civil here - see my response below. <strong>How were we supposed to know the admins intervened?</strong></p>

<p>[further down]</p>

<p><strong>Sarah_Connor</strong>: Fuck you <a href="/r/topmindsofreddit">/r/topmindsofreddit</a> - <strong>I attemted to reply MANY times</strong> and got &quot;403 error&quot; upon every submission.</p>

<p>[...]</p>

<p><strong>Moranall</strong>: I don&#39;t know what the &quot;403 error&quot; is but <strong>I just asked the mods here</strong> [TopMindsofReddit] <strong>to unban the r/conspiracy mods, so maybe that was the cause?</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Sarah_Connor</strong>: I have a life IRL outside of reddit.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Moranall</strong>: Completely understand that. <strong>I&#39;m just saying you had an opportunity of power.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Sarah_Connor</strong>: When I removed perms, <strong>ADMINS stepped</strong> in and basically threatened to take action if perms wernt put in place.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Moranall</strong>: No one was aware of this. That&#39;s not a good situation for you to be in.</p>

<p>No, I am NOT retracting. This defensive interaction with TMoR totally uncharacteristic, and demands an answer. </p>

<p>To date, the only response from S_C has been expletive-laced ad-hominem attacks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m aware of what TMoR is and have more than my share of &quot;exchange&quot; with them- to the point of being banned in fact.</p>

<p>I also watched that TMoR thread in real time, and your theory that SC was colluding with them simply makes no sense. If there was some covert action and collusion going on, why discuss it in a thread that anyone can read?  And pointing to the 403 error as evidence is faulty- that is exactly what happens when you respond to a user mention in a sub that you are banned from. </p>

<p>I literally was accused last night of being TMoR, which I reported, so you should be able to find it fairly easily. It&#39;s a terrible accusation without real proof, and I seriously hope this isn&#39;t the beginning of a new tactic to discredit users. </p>

<p>That is a valid point, one that I pondered myself from the day I first saw it.</p>

<p>Perhaps because he was unable to make contact via the &quot;usual channels&quot; (hence the 403 error complaints). He was clearly able to comment in the TMoR <strong><em>threads</em></strong> with no issues, wasn&#39;t he?</p>

<p>If he could not respond because he was banned, how was he able to comment in that thread??? Note that <strong>Moranall</strong> did not request that Conspiracy mods be unbanned until after the conversation was well underway.</p>

<p>And BTW, I am STILL banned there - have been for years.</p>

<p>Nah, something stinks here, and your explanations don&#39;t add up. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK - A_Q, I am going to actually give you the benefit of the doubt on this comment...</p>

<p>I think TMOR is abhorrent cunts. I have told the entire mod team MANY FUCKING TIMES that I have other shit outside of reddit that is way more important to my IRL than my reddit persona... and while I have a deep passion for <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> - I literally had minutes on a regular basis to try to absorb what was going on and respond - and it pissed me off to no end that diatrabes were written against me with no freaking context of what was going on with me, my time-balancing etc....</p>

<p>So Yes, I got PISSED and thus my expletives - but:</p>

<p>I was asked outside of reddit to remove mods (on multiple occasions) and I refused to do so.</p>

<p>I agreed, on multiple occassions to step down for Mr.D</p>

<p>I agreed to AP taking, and I PMd him telling him to discuss with me over my IRL persona email. He failed to do so. I brought that to modlog. </p>

<p>I 100% refute the authority of some ignorant admin &quot;redtaboo&quot; -- as (she) is DOUBTFULLY not one who has had her mind in the space of this /r/ for literally the 35 years that I have - nor been on fucking reddit for 11 years!</p>

<p>The calling out TMOR IS characteristic!</p>

<p>Pre-your-tenure, I called to ban ALL TMOR mods and participants with a bot... that idea was shot down.</p>

<p>Fuck anyone that thinks that I am a trump supporter -- but fuck anyone who thinks that I am an HRC supporter, fuc anyone that thinks that I was anti-semetic -- because Bernie Sanders was our only hope Obi Juan Ken-obi!</p>

<hr/>

<p>This is a fucking problem that is WAY THE FUCK OLDER than a couple of weeks here in this sub...</p>

<p>I have written entire articles against the buh cabal, worked in tech for my entire career and written here about that and the spying - the issues of the NSA since the 70s, the cia&#39;s bullshit - etc, etc, etc...</p>

<p>I supported the onboarding of every single mod on the fucking list! I was democratic, open and transparent with all of you..</p>

<p>I tried to herd you guys off reddit into slack - as the admins can read all our shit - that failed. even with threats.</p>

<p>I am convinced that one or several of you are an admin&#39;s alt.</p>

<p>Dont walk into the room acting like you can tie a brief period together with some stupid links when there is a LITERAL decade of daily viewing of this sub by me to see the trends and patterns.</p>

<p>and I was doing this shit since 1984 - my first woke moment was Iran Contra - then I have tracked and watched and learned.</p>

<p>I am completely positive I messed AP perms by accident, OR (and imagine this; a conspiracy!!) it was done by someone else! (Or I was drunk and I dont recall... ) -- But I reached out to AP to gmail me, crickets. People were banning shit left and right and bitching in mod mail and my fucking posts about being NON FUCKING POLITICAL were a clusterfuck of bitching - so I took action.</p>

<p>As top active mod it was my perm-right that allowed me to do so... then ppl bitched to the admins after you didnt listen to my AT LEAST FIVE FUCKING REQUESTS TO STOP BEING POLITICAL -- fuck I even made (I believe it was two) posts about this - and other mods swooped in and removed them saying &quot;whoa whoa whoa -- wait we cant just post this&quot; -- yet refusing to having an actual discourse in mod mail resulting in nothing</p>

<p>Have you ever worked on a high functioning, yet technical team - and LEAD one? At the end of the day you have SMEs in their respective disciplines who will not fucking agree on shit, and you make a decision as the leader of that team and execute - but you give everyone the opportunity to tell you &quot;what is wrong with this plan&quot; first -- and if they dont speak up at the design sessions, dry runs, etc -- they they cant bitch after - no matter what... and ESPECIALLY if it was their domain-of-expertise that caused the failure, they are to blame for the failure if they didnt speak out.</p>

<p>so ---</p>

<p>While Yu have some fair statements in your post - this is a far bigger issue than me telling you all to shut-the-fuck-up and restructure as you see fit...</p>

<p>ITS THE SAME PATTERN AS BEFORE -- I propose solutions, get ignored so I take action and you all bitch to mommy</p>

<p>And the admins are fucked for interveneing -- who the fuck are they? If they &quot;know whats best for the community&quot; -- then WHY ARE WE EVEN MODS????</p>

<p>I never agreed with Flytape on his politics- but the guy made a great effort to communicate. and I never removed any mods even when he was really pissed off at some of you -- but I re-added him after a 45-minute call and he made a good case for doing something - and I kept reminding him tokeep his fucking politics out of this.</p>

<p>So, at the end of the day, you all belong as exampes of <a href="/r/iamverysmart">/r/iamverysmart</a> because you dont even have a decade of context on the complexities of this /r/ and some millennial little SEO-Community-manager who hasnt built shit in silicon valley is going to &quot;evaluate&quot; me...</p>

<p>Good bye <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.</p>

<p>The day you pulled all of our perms your ORDERED us into the Slack room you created - and then you didn&#39;t bother to show up. Add to that your admission that your intent was  to evade the admins, and it all sounds pretty creepy. How were we supposed to interpret that?</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Action that left the sub totally unmoderated and open to attacks by saboteurs who could pose ANYTHING - Doxxing, child porn pics, ANYTHING... So you left admins with no choice but to intervene, and they could have done one of two things: KILL THE SUB, or override your actions.</p>

<p>Thankfully, they did the latter.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>you didnt listen to my AT LEAST FIVE FUCKING REQUESTS TO STOP BEING POLITICAL </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah. Right. What does <strong><em>STOP BEING POLITICAL</em></strong> even mean? This is a CONSPIRACY sub, and the vast majority of ALL conspiracies  - past or present - are politically related or have political implications.</p>

<p>You want to remove POLITICS from a CONSPIRACY sub? Okay, fine. Then we can no longer discuss American Revolution, the French Revolution, 9-11, JFK, WWI, WWII, Vietnam, the rise of Capitalism/ Bolshevism/ Communism/ Nazism/ Zionism...</p>

<p><strong><em>&quot;Stop being political&quot;?</em></strong> WTF does that mean to a CONSPIRACY sub?  What are you left with? Bigfoot, Flat-Earthers and Trolls?</p>

<p>That was a HELL of a lot of work to evade the primary question:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was unbanned to be allowed to respond as proposed by sabremesh in the above post.</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>Why did I resign?</strong></p>

<p>I resigned because of what I perceived to be an unwillingness of the majority of the mod team to agree on any effective strategy to combat the extreme politicisation of this sub subreddit by people who are otherwise uninterested in Conspiracy theories.</p>

<p>Many people are accusing me of only wanting to silence left-wing politics but everything that I personally suggested to the mod team was designed specifically to effect all political factions equally.  My personal opinion on what to do that would restore Conspiracy to a conspiracy subreddit was to limit the number of current-politics posts any one user would be allowed to submit in a 24 hour period as well as limiting the account age of users who would be allowed to post politics at all (1 year old accounts or older for example).  I&#39;m not 100% sure that these adjustments would have fixed anything at all but I designed the tactic to be tweakable and to effect both sides equally.  Obviously this idea was poo-pooed by other mods (I won&#39;t name names, rule10 amiright?)</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>Why did I assist Sarah_connor with removing all the mods?</strong></p>

<p>I did this as my last ditch effort to correct what I perceived as a moderation gridlock where mods were more concerned with high-brow idealisms (free flow of information) than they were with preservation of the Conspiracy sub for Conspiracy Theories.  Again this all goes back to people who outside of Trump, are totally uninterested in actual Conspiracy theories dominating the culture of a sub that is supposed to be about Conspiracy Theories.</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>Why did I start <a href="/r/ConspiracyRight">/r/ConspiracyRight</a> ?</strong></p>

<p>I started it because my perception of Reddit as a whole has taught me that conservative based anything (including Conspiracy theories) seem to be shouted out of existence on Reddit.  My personal perspective on the problems within the original sub <a href="/r/Conspiracy">/r/Conspiracy</a> is that the disruptive group, without regard to their opinion on Trump, is primarily left-wing political users.  I do not care about their opinion on Trump as I am well aware that current political personalities are always going to be a source of much controversy, my problem is with how these same users treat other Conspiracies that have nothing to do with Trump but align with left wing hot-button issues such as vaccines, climate change, religion, social policies that involve taxing us more to pay for etc etc.  I found a strong correlation with the sudden arrival of these left wing users and the sudden burial of these topics that were once popular to discuss here.</p>

<hr/>

<p>I was being confronted regularly by mods for banning users that clearly had no interest in having an honest conversation such as TMOR users because they happened to also be anti-trump.  This constant confrontation as well as constant rejection of any attempt by the mod team to lessen the influence of these users who are only interested in Trump&#39;s had gone on since shortly after Trump won the election in 2016.  This was not a sudden development in the mod team, nor was it a sudden decision by me to resign.  This was the end result of over half a year of infighting and stonewalling every proposed solution.  </p>

<p>In closing my resignation, dronepuppet&#39;s alt trolling and Sarah_connor&#39;s extreme actions all resulted from the same series of events.</p>

<p>For those of you who are celebrating my departure I would like to congratulate you on an empty victory, I was the mod who proposed public mod logs, who managed the wiki, who proposed to steer rule 1 away from &quot;hate speech&quot; (sjw control mechanism).  I did more work here than you deserved of me and if you feel like the work I did was negative then you&#39;re probably exactly the kind of person who has no real interest in conspiracy theories.</p>

<p>So fair we&#39;ll to you all, I now run an iron-fist style subreddit <a href="/r/ConspiracyRight">/r/ConspiracyRight</a> where you get to decide if you like it &quot;as-is&quot;. And some other thoughtful users are running <a href="/r/Conspiracyundone">/r/Conspiracyundone</a> in their own unique way without my personal conservative restrictions if you find that distasteful.</p>

<p>Best of luck to all of you!  Seek the truth, and remember that PERSONAL liberty can not be achieved through collectivism!</p>

<p>FTR I have no intention of attacking you as your aforementioned track record certainly speaks for itself. </p>

<p>I do think you have the best interest of the sub at heart, but pushing to demod the entire team was counter-productive and rash. Resigning was the right thing to do.</p>

<p>However, I see no reason why you shouldn&#39;t be allowed to continue participating with and contributing to the sub.</p>

<p>Your frustrations regarding the current divisive atmosphere here are justified, but I&#39;m hopeful that the true conspiricists will steer the sub away from this blatantly manufactured division. </p>

<p>I wish you the best and hope to see you on the other side...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re not good at this.</p>

<p>Perhaps you should explain to the community why you hang out with default mods in <a href="/r/dickgirls">/r/dickgirls</a>.  I&#39;m sure it has nothing at all to do with your desire to be included in their power club.</p>

<p>What I&#39;m saying is that your fake idealistic persona &quot;the free flow of information&quot; is just something you like to say to appeal to people and you don&#39;t actually believe it. You&#39;re just looking for your ticket to the in crowd.</p>

<p>I can prove you don&#39;t actually believe it.  I have years of screen shots, links and examples of you not actually believing it. </p>

<p>Furthermore, the Conspiracy sub, should be primarily for the community to talk about Conspiracy Theories.   If we have to disrupt the free flow of information to make that happen, I&#39;m perfectly okay with that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, as I was saying above, I think the underlying implication of your view is that information contained in the media can not be a conspiracy, and therefore should be banned.</p>

<p>Is it not the case that you ban just such topics in your conspiracy spin off you created?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is not my view at all.</p>

<p>My view is that Conspiracy shouldn&#39;t be a place where people just competitively spam MSM articles without even bothering to explain why they feel it&#39;s relevant to some Conspiracy or to editorialize the title to make that obvious.</p>

<p>If you guys continue to have no standards in regards to that, the subreddit will continue to look like you have no standards.  That&#39;s not a good look man.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure it&#39;s just a coincidence that there is an active assault against alternative media going on by Google, Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and even Reddit while suddenly we have very new accounts that literally spam MSM garbage articles as-is without even editorializing the title to fit /Conspiracy.</p>

<p>They <em>would</em> say that. There&#39;s no moral reason to expect subreddits to govern themselves with voting, even more so when you consider the possibility that ShareBlue could be getting a green light from the admins to manipulate votes as much as they like.  </p>

<p>I trusted <a href="/u/Sarah_Connor">/u/Sarah_Connor</a> and <a href="/u/Flytape">/u/Flytape</a> more than half of the mods that were removed.

<p>What about my response was particularly elitist, would you care to quote it?</p>

<p>The question remains, if you get so riled up on folks calling your transparent backstory and motives into question, why not use one of your more substantiated and credible accounts when trying to make a comment that folks will take seriously (i.e. opening on the status of a community you frequent from a knowledgeable position)?  Perhaps the easiest explanation is that you only started hanging around here in 2016...wonder what the impetus was that brought you here </p>

Digg exodus was actually in &#39;10 my friend, r/conspiracy was &#39;08...your dates don&#39;t make sense and further make me doubt you having a vested interest in the sub past pushing a certain perspective.

<p>No Reddit interactions don&#39;t make me feel special, they make me rather fatalist and sad for our youth&#39;s future.

    <div class="md"><p>Well there&#39;s a nice credible response...you should&#39;ve led with this one to avoid being lumped in with the unsavory fellows I described in the above post with whom you fraternize. If you are in fact one of those fellows after all, you may be onto a better approach for credibility with this exchange. </p>

<p>What are your thoughts on the pointless MOAB against Assad, as well as the theory that he was tipped?  What are your thoughts on the Afghan surge?  Do you feel like you knowingly voted for &quot;Fire and Fury&quot; and are you happy with the cadre of Generals who seem to be running the show these days?  You&#39;re decently younger than me, but I wonder if you voted for Bush II or would have?</p>

<p>I also liked Ron Paul over McCain, but also don&#39;t think Obama was particularly damaging (his biggest disappointment was falling well short, but it was expected and unsurprising given the mad he was dealt...certainly don&#39;t understand most of the animosity directed at him from his former voters beyond the low hanging fruit racism option). Speaking as a longtime NYC resident who is highly taxed on my finance-y salary, I don&#39;t object to his tenure and would probably be a bit left of center fiscally, well left of center socially.  New Yorkers saw this Trump fiasco from a mile away based on the regional tabloids (he was a laughing stock even before his first season of the Apprentice; Western bankers simply do not respect him professionally). It&#39;s baffling to me that anyone besides his dumb-dumb core in FL or KY, or the super edgy internet teenager cadre, can possibly continue devoting their personal internet time supporting him on the internet. </p>

<p>Frankly, I don&#39;t understand how you can reconcile Trump or deflect so hard against uncovering his Russian issue...particularly in this sub, curiosity should override all but the most edgelord-ey or fervent blind support of him. I think that&#39;s why so many of us &quot;shills&quot; have been frustrated with this sub for the last and are happy that it&#39;s starting to kick out the bad-faith-participants: sheer curiosity into such an alleged big deal should override partisanship and tribalism, yet here we are today. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was not old enough to vote for Bush 2 but I considered myself a liberal then and always supported Democrats my entire life until Obama&#39;s 2nd term I voted Libertarian. I hate Bush 2 and all neoconservatives with a passion. Never would have thought I would vote Republican but Trump isn&#39;t a Republican, thats why the neoconservatives hate him.</p>

<p>The pointless MOAB on Assad seemed like political theater to me.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not at all thrilled about the Afghan surge but I am willing to give it some time to see how it all plays out before passing heavy judgement.</p>

<p>I voted for the lesser of 2 evils. Gary Johnson and Jill Stein were controlled opposition.</p>

<p>The Russia stuff is about as intelligent as the birther nonsense when Obama was elected. It&#39;s all political theater to divide and conquer.</p>

<p>The only reason I support Trump at all online is because of all over the top opposition to him and Shareblue leading that opposition. I thought you were Shareblue at first but this comment has convinced me your a legitimate user. People online go out of their way to hate on Trump over non-issues to the point that its so obnoxious that I can&#39;t help but want to support Trump even more out of spite regardless of my thoughts on things like the Afghan surge.</p>

<p>Some context in that case. The admins rely on and expect subreddit moderators to prevent/remove doxx. Subs that repeatedly fail to do this get banned. </p>

<p>Individual mods who allow a doxx also get banned by the admins. In the last six months, two <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> mods have been banned by the admins for inadvertently approving a comment/post which contained a link to doxx. Both bans were overturned by the admins on appeal, because it was clear there was no malicious intent, but the lesson is that the admins rely on mods to prevent doxx, and a sub like this one would be regarded by the admins as a high risk without active moderators.</p>

<p>Yes, the 13 mods who were demodded without warning by SC did contact the admins with a request that they adjudicate on the matter. SC was here for a long time, but his contribution was sketchy to say the least, and if you recall, he disappeared in 2016 for a year because, as he informed the sub &quot;he was being investigated by the FBI&quot;. And when the account was reactivated at the end of last year, there was considerable doubt that the account was not being controlled by the original user. His erratic behaviour since then, and his attempts to remove all the active mods should be assessed with that in mind.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alefantis is a public figure. Talking about him is not doxxing.</p>

<p>They aren&#39;t really clear on what constitutes actual doxxing, so we err on the side of caution. It sucks because I am definitely for pizzagate exposure. It isn&#39;t about Alefantis, it never was. That was just useful as a high profile example. </p>

<p>But at the same time, I understand the concern. And everything always references back to the same voat materials that we have been specifically warned about. And I don&#39;t think we can be expected to follow every rabbit trail on the mega posts to make sure nothing inappropriate is revealed. It sucks. If PG posters want to do us a favor and decrease the chance of removal, don&#39;t link to the mega threads. Let what evidence you have stand on its own. There are ways to reference other things that don&#39;t include links. We are a creative bunch. </p>

<p>Yes this could easily be admin censorship, but it could just as easily be reasonable precaution, I personally think they want us to discuss it here if it is discussed anywhere, because it keeps it contained. But if there are no links to massive archives I will absolutely take the time to go verify and approve a PG post.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a modmail where DP admitted to using the alt accounts, but he never followed through when asked why he did so. He told us he would compile a &quot;report&quot; about his &quot;expeirment&#39;, but never presented it. I can hunt down that modmail now, but its 2-3 weeks back so its going to take a few mins.</p>

<p>For the record, I voted against removing dronepuppet from the modteam originally (over the alt account situation), but I did support his removal after the &quot;coup&quot; behaviour and his failure to follow up with an explanation regarding the alt accounts after 2 weeks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve seen this before: a bunch of junior mods get rid of the long time mods with help of the admins.  This is a coup, however you justify it.</p>

<p>My suggestion on how to resolve this:  reinstate SC as head mod, reinstate Flytape amd DronePuppet, then the rest of the team steps down.  Sarah Connor and Flytape then chose a new mod team.  If they want amy of you back after this, fine, but frankly I trust SC&#39;s and FT&#39;s opinions over the rest of you combined.</p>

<p>The fact that you banned Flytape so he couldn&#39;t tell his side speaks volumes.  And banning the oldest mod for rule 10 is absolute bullshit.  If Flytape thinks there are shills on the mod team them the community needs to hear his evidence.</p>

Their political views are not relevant, nor what they may have done in the past to build trust.

There&#39;s zero circumstance where that&#39;s acceptable. And they&#39;ve had ample opportunities to convince me otherwise, I&#39;ve read all of Flytape&#39;s comments on this.

<p>Criticism is accepted and encouraged, but calling a user you disagree with an idiot, a moron, a retard, a shill, etc. is not a criticism of idea; it&#39;s just an ad hominem attack.

<p>Which was, once again, not communicated to the community in an open fashion.  Making a thread, explicitly saying what is allowed in a stickied post would be helpful, as it is too many people aren&#39;t willing to talk because they will lose access to this sub.</p>

<p>During the first incident when <em>only</em> our perms were removed, Sarah was convinced (by the admins) to restore mine and I immediately restored the perms of the rest of the team.</p>

<p>During the incident on Friday (the so-called Friday called massacre), the damage was done pretty quickly...I immediately replied to Sarah&#39;s PM telling him to respond to me via reddit (as I don&#39;t use an email address with this account) but he never did.</p>

<p>At this point, the admins interceded and restored the mods, and we immediately set to trying to figure out wtf had just happened.</p>

<p>The perpetrators of the coup had an obvious agenda of pulling this place far to the right and(way more destructively) turning it into a safe space echo chamber for such beliefs.

<p>This pretty much was how they pulled off the last election---they beat the drum for 9/11, JFK, the global peso ring, so we would think they were &quot;one of us.&quot; Now that they&#39;re in, it&#39;s clear that was all just a marketing tactic. </p>

<p>Amazing unanimity! ;(</p>

<p>In US, what passes for politics really has nothing to do with left-vs-right.</p>

<p>Why is healthcare, for example, not a political issue anywhere else other than US? This is where American Exceptionalism really is a millstone around the American neck.</p>

<p>Environment used to be non-political in US – it was Nixon who established EPA. Now it’s been politicised. And so it goes.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Gotta stop you here. Sweden and the UK both have healthcare as major issues nearly every election. Only issue is that we&#39;re moving towards US style healthcare. Both of us have privatized large parts of health services, while still funded by taxes though. So the issues are different, but it&#39;s still big issues. We&#39;re just sadly sliding in the wrong direction. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, something similar also goes on in Canada – a creeping retreat from the single payer system towards more commercialisation. Although there are also country-specific issues involved, since most Canadians with money can always go to the US for treatment, if they so desire. So this is not such a big issue politically.</p>

<p>But, in this case, what we’re seeing is the perfidious US influence around the world. The Americans screwed up their own country in healthcare, and now they’re going around the world and spreading their own toxic juice (commercialisation) everywhere else. ;(</p>

<p>Profit motive simply doesn’t work in healthcare. There are too many intangibles involved.</p>

<p>S_C acted like a despot and was not following the rules that guide this community. DP was using alt to bait out bans, not communicating with the rest of the team but clearly coordinating with the coup faction. And Flytape was just an unrelenting nonstop disaster to this sub.

<p>Sarah_Connor, who is the most senior active mod and who is not right wing at all, saw that the new crop of mods were ShareBlue operatives assigned to destroy this sub by allowing shills to run havoc.
Sarah did the right thing by de-modding these Trojan horsemen. Sarah had every right to do so. It is written in the rules that senior mods have the power to de-mod junior mods. Sarah did not break any rules.
These ShareBlue mods then run crying to Reddit admins and the coup succeeds. Another subreddit killed from the inside by ShareBlue trojans.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good luck pushing this narrative. Things I see that are going to make it difficult:</p>

<p>The dramatic improvement to this sub since the failed coup.</p>

<p>DP using alts to bait users into bans</p>

<p>Flytape was a plague of cancers upon this sub. Birdmask webcast. Rolling out the red carpet for T_D when they are a proud eco chamber incubator and r/C is the literal opposite. Doing everything in his power to turn this place into a safe space for T_D and rendering the sub into a divided and conquered hellscape as a result. </p>

<p>S_C transparently acting like a despot against a community famously resentful of power and its abuses. </p>

<p>So yeah good luck w/that. Also your post constitutes a shill accusation against the whole mod team so you can best be sure that&#39;s getting reported.</p>

<p>Yes we should be asking questions, it&#39;s good if you&#39;re suspicious and have unresolved questions. You should ask them. But there seems to be a default assumption here that of something is shady, it musta been shills. Where as shilling is the laziest and least falsifiable explanation for a given phenomena.

    <div class="md"><p>Holy shit you&#39;re dense. My point initially was that this sub is dead. Reread my first comment if you want to know why. Your reply to that was painting my words falsely. If I did not respond, someone could misinterpret my point because of how you misdirected it. Intentionally or not, you fucking did; you probably had a bias responding to me since you thought I was OP.  Honestly, I dont give two fucks what your response to this is; you can tell me all you want that you champion this idea or that but deep down you have a bias and it is showing. </p>

<p>On a side note, If I remember correctly, accusations of shills was not against the rules until recently. The whole idea of calling someone out is moot at this point because shilling has evolved to something more than just a paid commenter or a bot. Its the common person shilling the bullshit they are fed and engineered to believe as fact or truth. 4/5 years ago, this sub had maybe 70,000 subs if I remember correctly. Now its over 400,000. Read between the lines in what I am trying to tell you, or more specifically, make your own conclusion. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You mentioned that the sub was dead, then moved on to a wider argument that since so many people think that, shouldn&#39;t they all be banned for shill accusations? I responded to this argument, which is an implicit acknowledgement to the position that you built it from. If you need me to explicitly respond to that, I will.</p>

<p>You think this sub is dead. Ok. You post in it a lot for a dead sub but cool man you do you.  </p>

<p>You spend the last paragraph conflating shills with useful idiots. Two very different things, does no good at all to paint them with the same brush. I agree they are both important issues. </p>

<p>No shill accusation rule has been around for a fairly long time. Regardless, its utility is clear. Without it divide and conquer wins completely, you just get two sides screaming &quot;shill!&quot; at each other. Or an echo chamber. </p>

<p>My comment is was in reference to the replies you are making here, with me. If I really think a sub is dead, I move on.</p>

<p>As I&#39;ve said, I pretty much never look at user names when reading reddit. I just read the posts.</p>

<p>I do largely agree with your point on the evolution of shills. The term &quot;useful idiot&quot; is from the cold war, I believe. Describes an unwitting asset you has swallowed propaganda and is happy to repeat it for you. The pejorative connotation has not meant by me, I don&#39;t really believe in idiots. Just people who have be mislead. </p>

<p>That&#39;s because AE911truth is likely controlled opposition (like Jones) who are distracting us with &quot;thermite&quot; red herrings and the like.</p>

<p>I&#39;m willing to change my perspective if I see valid explanations for these problems (and more), but until then I refuse to accept that <em>all</em> possibilities for their collapse aren&#39;t on the table.</p>

<p>False, this is a slander tactic is straight out of topmindsofreddit.</p>

<p>Jones et al worked on muon-catalyzed fusion and still to this day holds the world record on energy release of fusion energy per muon and proved that is was not a viable energy source for mass scale.</p>

<p>Another slander tactic.</p>

<p>You are of course forgetting the fact there are two that I know of, peer reviewed scientific papers that in one directly confirms there was nano thermite and the other confirms this to be true by proving that the rubble pile had energetic materials within it.</p>

<p>Judy Wood has no such peer review of course.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>AE911truth has no good explanation for the toasted cars, the minimal seismic record of the 3 collapses</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sure they do, the toasted cars is obviously explained by the fact the buildings were packed with nano thermite (if you are talking about the cars blocks away, they were towed there) and the <a href="http://911research.wtc7.net/wtc/analysis/collapses/freefall.html">seismic record</a> is consistent and not in dispute by any credible person or organization.</p>

<p>You need to read up on logical fallacies, it isn&#39;t an appeal to authority, when they are the actual authority.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>As things settle down, the <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> mod team will be uttering a sigh of relief, as it&#39;s clearly in the best interest of the sub to simply move forward.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Uhhh no. Step back a bit. What the fuck are you guys doing.</p>

<p>No shit Sarah Connor is going to freak out when you guys can just vote to take power like that without consulting the sub or anything. That&#39;s shady as fuck. And you use the admins to get your way when we already know the admins of this site aren&#39;t to be trusted and clearly work with shills and bot swarms and don&#39;t care about the communities within the site. </p>

<p>There are too many suspicious actors on the mod team now to just leave this issue alone. Even just the fact that a power mod like AssuredlyAThrowaway is so heavily involved with this acting as an admin liaison of sorts and is still on the mod team is absurd. And reading some of the modmail it&#39;s hard to trust a few of the others as well. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not trying to call anyone out as I don&#39;t specifically know those involved to be able to claim anything definitively about them but this whole situation is hard to just accept the way it is. I&#39;m just saying it&#39;s hard to trust that what happened is all well and good the way this went down. People seem too eager to label this as a coup and that Sarah_Connor was just being selfish and vindictive. He has clear reasons for distrusting what was going on as well as a solid history of being impartial and wanting what is best for the sub. It&#39;s hard to trust that everyone involved has the right motives and it would be indistinguishable if they didn&#39;t.</p>

<p>Though I will repeat that I have serious distrust for AATA. Power mods should not be a part of a sub like this to begin with, and especially not one who seems to be involved with the admins to the degree that he is. I also remember 10 months ago like 2 days before he became the mod of the wikileaks sub he was trashing the sub in another sub and then suddenly he became a mod of wikileaks (????). That was one of the weirdest things to me, like why would someone scoffing at the sub suddenly be made a mod? And that was during the time that people felt the wikileaks sub was being taken over.</p>

<p>I felt this way for a while but just accepted and ignored it because he seemed to not do anything bad and I had faith that the existing power structure would sound the alarms if that changed and he actually proved to have ulterior motives. Well now that can&#39;t really happen (and is apparently being prevented from happening). Maybe he does good work and isn&#39;t as shady as he seems but I think it is entirely reasonable to be skeptical and perhaps being so worthy of skepticism is enough that someone shouldn&#39;t be a mod of a conspiracy sub. But of course that isn&#39;t necessarily what is best, it&#39;s just something to consider and discuss.</p>

<p>S_C agreed to voluntarily give up the top mod spot months ago.

    <div class="md"><p>Not this sub, r/wikileaks. Like 2 days before you became a mod for that sub you were saying things to the effect of what a joke it is and that you don&#39;t go there (in a different sub, I forget which). Then you suddenly became a mod of it and I specifically asked you way back then why you would become a mod for a sub if you aren&#39;t a fan of it but you never replied. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t mean to attack you personally, you seem all right to me honestly and I don&#39;t have any concerns with your actual moderation (but of course if you were up to no good you wouldn&#39;t do any obvious destructive moderating, you would work behind the scenes which it sort of appears you do).

    <div class="md"><p>No, not wikileaks itself. The wikileaks sub. If I wasn&#39;t lazy and if it really mattered I&#39;d go back and find your comment to clear this up. And I mean, my wording is probably a bit unfair since I&#39;m just going off of memory. But the core of it was you were clearly an outsider to the sub and had no interest in it and then immediately following that comment you were made a mod during the time the sub was having strange changes made.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t feel like you have to defend yourself. It&#39;s not worth getting into a discussion about it. I&#39;m just saying that I think there is enough info and peculiar happenings surrounding you to say that it is valid to be suspicious of you as a mod of this sub. I think anyone can agree that this is a matter of fact. However, even if we accept that is true it doesn&#39;t mean you aren&#39;t a good mod or that it necessarily indicates you should not be a mod or that you have ulterior motives and I am certainly not one to decide that anyway.

    <div class="md"><p>Sure, but this sub reddit has been infiltrated and compromised by the left. Just look at the comments. Disinformation and rejection of even simple ideas everywhere. Then once you put your opinion out there, they argue non-nonsensical off topic issues. It is not a lack of their understand but a more control diversionary tactic. It is like a Divide and Conquer technique. They give no middle ground on sensitive and controversial issues. 
You say that is it an illusion but people are the fallible cog in the machine here, you&#39;ll get some that can be fair and look over the other side of the fence but the reality is that it doesn&#39;t work that way. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am sure that it has, Shareblue is a real thing and the internet is increasingly a balkanized battleground of ideas. (I think the same thing is happening on the right, and that it is a complete waste of effort to try and figure out which side has it worse.)</p>

<p>My point is that you cannot fight that by ratcheting up the intensity and frequency of the rate at which your side dumps out rhetoric, whichever side that may be. It is the literal equivalent of trying to fight fire with fire, it makes the problem much worse and then the other side escalates in response. By trying to achieve balance you directly make the other side stronger and drastically increase the effectiveness of divide and conquer. </p>

<p>Anything that scans as a shill or brigade accusation feeds this dynamic.</p>

<p>The only solution that I can see is to treat every user as a real person, only critically engage with the actual arguments they are putting forward, stay civil and call out all logical fallacies you can identify. </p>

<p>None of you belong here, all you can do it take over other people&#39;s shit and then start turning the screws to make it shitty like most of Reddit already is (Because it&#39;s run by liberals like you).</p>

<p>I quit modding because we failed to reset Conspiracy to it&#39;s roots.  You won creq, you successfully Fucked over another sub.  Congratulations but you won&#39;t pretend like I started this shit.  </p>

<p>you still carry out on <a href="/r/conspiracyright">/r/conspiracyright</a> where you banned me for nothing</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It says clearly on the sidebar that I won&#39;t tolerate liberals.  You included.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Too bad you took Sarah down with yourself.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wtf kind of crack are you smoking, you motherfuckers had already voted to remove Sarah, and drone before I did anything.  Funny you need the liberal admins to help your take over,  you&#39;re going to try to blame Sarah being gone on me when I was one of three who voted not to remove anyone.</p>

<p>Fucking liar.</p>

<p>No one pay attention to the Democrats ignoring their own rigged primary to go and protest a candidate that is running in the other party.

<li>kinda true, but is always fun that you won&#39;t mention why was horrible, because whatever the Clinton&#39;s shortcomings, Trump has 100 times worst. Lies? Corruption? Proovably 100 times more. </li>
</ol>

<p>Most of the fuzz about the e-mails was about national security and allegations that she profited personally from her political role; <a href="https://www.google.it/amp/s/www.theatlantic.com/amp/article/508382/">trump does it every day</a>; look at that fucking list, no divesting, no Tax return... none cares.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Companies don&#39;t want psychos, racist and misogynist idiots to represent them: big fucking news. They can still write books, can still express their opinions, which does not entail there are no consequences for being a hateful moron.</p></li>
<li><p>Interrupting? You mean by counter-protesting ? Disagreeing? Guess what, is all free speech aswell even if it bothers you. Snowflake. </p></li>
<li><p>Bravo! Talk about bikelocks and not violence in general, or your attempt at painting anti-fascism as the violent ideology would not work so well. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fuckthealtright/comments/6yu5bm/five_absurd_attempts_to_equate_rightwing/">74% against 2% </a> oh, but bikelocks....that&#39;s graphic, scary, makes me forget how numbers work. </p></li>
<li><p>Accept to have lost in a system heavily skewed to favour the GOP over the popular vote. Sanders was treated unfairly, but at least didn&#39;t lose getting more votes. Would you accept a system skewed the other way, to make democratic candidates win despite getting less votes nation-wide? 
Yeah, I didn&#39;t think so, but you&#39;ll support until It suites you: no principles whatsoever.</p></li>

The Daily-fucking-caller had to admit it, although their bias shows in how they desperately try to change the subject to propriety damage, and debate how the killings were motivated. They can&#39;t spin the numbers much tho:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The data from our analysis comes from the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START), a university research center partially funded by the Department of Homeland Security.
Our findings support the ADL statistic. Using their definition of right-wing extremists, we found that 92 percent of ideologically motivated homicide incidents were committed with a right-wing extremist or white supremacist motive.
The Government Accountability Office (GAO) conducted a somewhat similar analysis of domestic extremism since the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks and found that 73 percent of all domestic extremist incidents that resulted in death were perpetrated by so-called right-wing extremists.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t say this sub <strong>is</strong> t_d light. I welcome criticism from and of all sides-- they had an objective in what they were doing, and it seems they were trying to turn it into something that would lean more to one side of the political spectrum.</p>

That&#39;s bullshit, and I wouldn&#39;t stand for it if it was an obvious leftist mod either. We should all be working together. </p>

<p>The perpetrators of the coup had an obvious agenda of pulling this place far to the right and(way more destructively) turning it into a safe space echo chamber for such beliefs. T_D users got used to their second dumping ground and are pissed that it is going to be less accommodating to them in the future, so they are doing what they have always done here: weakly grasp around for a flimsy conspiracy narrative that they can use to try and get what they want. </p>

<p>That&#39;s how these users have always seen conspiracies, as a means of packaging their ideology and of getting what they want. Not as a way to uncover truth. To them it&#39;s a weapon, not a tool. </p>

Kind of a weird consideration I haven&#39;t thought of before, but if I am, for example, having a 12th birthday party, and my mother gets me a birthday card, I can look at that card and be sure I&#39;m 12.
