    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. Even if you go back to the 90s, Usenet groups were horrible for it. I remember trying to download (pictures) on a 42kb modem and it turning out to be some skinhead BS propaganda.</p>

<p>Then you hit the wrong group and it was full of hate speech. </p>

<p>Early 90s there was a rash of Klan marches. Turned out to be a couple of guys wearing sheets. In one town, there was 1 man wearing the sheets marching down the street by himself surrounded by journalists and people making fun of him. </p>

<p>Also, let&#39;s not forget the rash of white supremacists they found on army bases, they used the office computers and printers to create hate speech newsletters and emails.</p>

<p>And there were still lots of real attacks though. Horrible racist attacks. One man dragged behind a pickup truck, it was all over the news. </p>

<p>I still think the incidents of hate/racial attacks are still less than just regular old crime.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have seen it.  I mean just go check the comment section of any youtube video.  Shit really started to get bad during the campaign when there were just bots spamming political shit on all sides.  Now you see the same exact technique being used but the bots are spamming either white racism or anti white racism.  Giant Swastikas...  so forth.  Sure some if it is probably edgy kids, and that has always been a factor.  But there has been an extremely big boost in racism, particularly spam style stuff.</p>

<p>TPTB are using ALL of us - regardless of race, religion, gender, etc.  We are ALL nothing but objects to them - useful only to the extent we help them reach their goals - in this case, by division.</p>

<p>Anyone who believes the people behind Antifa and Nazism (yes, it is the same group,) anyone who believes the open/civil society rhetoric, needs to look at the what the people who bought into actually purchased - Sweden, Germany and Ukraine, for example.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hate to break it to you but the racism thing has been going on for a long time, both as actual murderous hatred and a method of control.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In spite of such preconceptions about blackness, in spite of special subordination of blacks in the Americas in the seventeenth century, there is evidence that where whites and blacks found themselves with common problems, common work, common enemy in their master, they behaved toward one another as equals. As one scholar of slavery, Kenneth Stampp, has put it, Negro and white servants of the seventeenth century were &quot;remarkably unconcerned about the visible physical differences.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Black and white worked together, fraternized together. The very fact that laws had to be passed after a while to forbid such relations indicates the strength of that tendency. In 1661 a law was passed in Virginia that &quot;in case any English servant shall run away in company of any Negroes&quot; he would have to give special service for extra years to the master of the runaway Negro. In 1691, Virginia provided for the banishment of any &quot;white man or woman being free who shall intermarry with a negro, mulatoo, or Indian man or woman bond or free.&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>MSM = main stream media (TV, radio, newspapers, magazines)</p>

<p>ALT = alternative media (Alex Jones)</p>

<p>MSM is the big media, the corporate giants who set the agenda on what the news will be that day. it is commonly thought among their audiences that the different MSM outlets merely &quot;lean left&quot; or &quot;lean right&quot;, but overall they get the basic facts correct, even if they accentuate or downplay certain facts that are favorable/unfavorable to their right/left narrative-crafting</p>

<p>ALT media -  is supposedly the &quot;alternative&quot; the the big media, for those enlightened few that realize that big media is just endless propaganda. supposedly the alternative media will give you the truth, but often they are just controlled-opposition/limited hangout (like Alex Jones of InfoWars/ StratFor) </p>

<p>as a matter of fact, it seems to me that the popular use of the phrase &quot;alt right&quot; was in reference to &quot;right leaning&quot; ALT news sources such as InfoWars, </p>

<p>and &quot;alt left&quot; was the media for the lefty/liberals who left MSM </p>

<p>then one day &quot;alt right&quot; became synonymous with &quot;nazi&quot;, &quot;white supremacy&quot;</p>

<p>and &quot;alt left&quot; became synonymous with &quot;antifa&quot; and &quot;black bloc&quot;?</p>

<p>SM social media - places like reddit, where real people talk to AI robots.  </p>

<p>social : to share and/or talk about</p>

<p>media : videos, pics, text, games, books, etc</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You need to go further back in the election. Look up the white supremacist Richard Spencer and his interviews and messages from 2010 up. He started using the term to unite white supremacists from various outlets. These outlets picked up the Alt-Right banner as a rebranding marketing principle. After 2010 you can see many white supremacy groups identify themselves on message boards as Alt-right. This also ties in with groups outside the US, particularly European white supremacists identifying as Alt-Right. The origins are years before the election.</p>

<p><em>And while the John Birch Society changed most of the leading players in their conspiracy theory to what they call the “insiders” rather than Jews, many others still see the Jew as the monster controlling world events. For these anti-Semites the Jew is often referred to as the “International Banker.” All of these groups together, both Identity and non-Identity white supremacist, hold a dangerous sociopolitical view. Their mutual solution to this supposed “Jewish control” is a race war. This war is considered by many Identity teachers to be the last great battle, Armageddon. According to these teachers, at the head of this conspiracy that leads to the final battle is ZOG: Zionist Occupation Government. Zionist Occupation Government simply means to Identity adherents that the Jewish conspiracy has taken over the government of the United States. Since they also believe that Jewish leaders are using other races to destroy the white race, the final battle pits the white race against virtually all others. And, because they constantly feed on conspiracy theories that involve those whose beliefs or politics oppose their own, Identity’s political and religious opposites are also considered their enemies. Furthermore, they do not have to love their enemies because they consider most of them subhuman.</em></p>

<p>So you think Christian White Supremacists are the threat? Sorry to disappoint you, but I&#39;m Jewish and I have never had a problem with any Christians. I live in the Southern Bible Belt surrounded by Christians. I feel perfectly safe.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>A threat, what does that mean exactly? Do I feel personally threatened? Of course not. Do I think it&#39;s dangerous on the streets because of these people? no I don&#39;t.  Do I think these people are dangerous? Yes- timothy mcveigh, eric rudolph, dylan roof, wayne michael page were dangerous and these were just the handful that carried out their acts.  Do I think that these people want to change laws and limit people&#39;s rights? yes, given the opportunity they definitely would and we are currently in a time when these people feel emboldened in a way they haven&#39;t in quite a while. Much of this is coming from movements in the EU, Australia, South Africa and now these folks can communicate more freely than ever before which is why I think it&#39;s something to quell and keep at bay sooner rather than later.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The racism has always been there. </p>

<p>I think its the rise in social media and cell phones that allowed incidents that were once very localized to become nationalized in seconds. </p>

<p>Think about the Rodney King situation in LA. I&#39;ve seen tons of interviews with black people from the area saying that being roughed up by the police was a pretty normal thing at the time. What was different was someone grabbed it on camera. Things blew up after the decision was made that the cops did nothing wrong.</p>

<p>Now instead of once in a blue moon case of someone being caught being &quot;racist&quot; on camera, its now a common occurrence. This doesnt mean its any more or less common, but we are much more aware. Its real easy for the human mind to go with emotional arguments and say that the person that was hurt or killed was done so without justification 9 times out of 10. Follow that up with 9 times out of 10 its determined that the police or whatever party acted appropriately following an internal investigation it can lead to a massive distrust in the system as a whole. </p>

<p>Combine this with a 24 news cycle that throws any &quot;news&quot; in your face at high velocity at all times can make any average person think a handful of events actually is an epidemic. </p>

<p>TL;DR: Some people are racist, some people are trying to take advantage of the situation to advance their agenda.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s what I think whenever I see someone online who goes out of their way to make it clear to everyone how anti-semitic they are, even when it has nothing to do with anything. I&#39;m sure that people are paid to come into communities like this and make a racist scene just to paint the community in a negative light. </p>

<p>That said, I haven&#39;t noticed anything conspicuous like that lately. Seeing how the corporate media started pushing racial tensions recently, I half-expected to see a bunch of self-identified &quot;neo-nazis&quot; popping up telling us how we have to use violence against Black Lives Matter or something. I&#39;ve seen nothing like that though, thankfully. Most of the people seeming to be intentionally stoking the flames of racial tension seem to be more of a &quot;They&#39;re all Nazis! Everyone who disagrees with me is a Nazi! We have to assault all the Nazis EVERYWHERE!&quot; type. </p>

<p>Sandy Hook was to make you hate guns</p>

<p>OKC bombing was to make you hate veterans</p>

<p>the holocaust was to make you hate Germans</p>

<p>the fake beheading of James Wright Foley was to make you hate ISIS (a Mossad proxy)</p>

<p>Occupy was to make you hate liberals</p>

<p>TeaParty was to make you hate conservatives </p>

<p>and once you know the game, you start to see it everywhere</p>

<p>and when you see it, take a moment, and be in the moment, </p>

<p>and shift up from that low-energy, negative-hate </p>

<p>into a higher-energy, positive-love state of mind </p>

<p>&#39;A bunch of guys in a black car stop and get out, one punches the victim in the face then yells &#39;Trump in 2016!&#39; and they speed off.&#39;</p>

<p>And many of them just look really a lot like something I&#39;d picture as false flag ops.  How many times have we seen verified false flag vandalism of Synagogues, and who can forget the fake black woman sending herself racist hate mail then reporting it to the police.</p>

<p>The media is a very effective tool for getting the most mileage from things that actually happen and things that are staged.  Too bad most people just eat that shit up without ever stopping and saying &#39;who is trying to get me mad here and what&#39;s in it for them?&#39;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not on the internet but in real life for me. </p>

<p>In the 80&#39;s my parents took my sister and I to Gettysburg for a family vacation (I was 8) and I got a Confederate Flag as a souvenir (not a 5&#39; x 3&#39;, more like 18&quot; x 12&quot;). I hung that flag up in my room and it stayed there until the early 90&#39;s when I hung it up in my basement after my dad finished it. </p>

<p>I met my best friend in 1992, and we would hang out in the basement all the time, sometimes up to 5 days a week for years with that same flag hanging on the wall. Then when we both went off to college in 1998 I took it with me and hung it up in my dorm room, then my apartment, and my buddy would come over a few times a year, and that exact flag was always there. </p>

<p>Then when I bought my house I hung it up in my garage, right next to a jolly roger and a American Flag. And my friend saw that flag every single time he came over, at least 300 times in the last 15 years. He never said a word about it. </p>

<p>Then two months ago he came over and just layed into me about having it displayed and how disappointed he was with me for having one. A flag that I have owned since 1988 and that he has been around on almost a weekly basis since 1992. Then suddenly 2 months ago he decided that it was offensive and that he &quot;Lost a lot of respect for me&quot; because I owned it. </p>

<p>It&#39;s some Manchurian Candidate shit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Manchurian Candidate reference is because he could see the symbol his entire life and not care, then one day he sees it and it sets him off.</p>

<p>Maybe the <em>flag</em> has changed meanings over time and today more progressive people are changing their perception of it along/concurrently with the social perception. </p>

<p>Or that people always held those feelings but since there was no social standard they just didn&#39;t care to share their feelings. But now that it&#39;s universal, it&#39;s OK to speak out. </p>

<p>Or maybe the left feels that they are pushed into a corner and when We had a Black Liberal President it wasn&#39;t a big deal to see a flag at Pep-Boys or at a Sporting Event, but since Trump won they are now lashing out against all people and symbols that represent the right. </p>

<p>For the record, I am not a Republican. </p>

<p>People like you are just actually paying attention to the racism and other crap. I have not seen any general increase, or massive influx, or any change in the amount of it. It&#39;s all been around for a while, white supremacy grew during the Obama years, Nazis closely related grew marginally along side. Militia groups also grew over the years with a good number having white supremacy tendencies. </p>

<p>Stop thinking it&#39;s bots or something, nothing has changed, you just weren&#39;t looking. Maybe you seen (((these))) around here? Chances are high that the poster using them are a Neo Nazi to some degree.</p>

<p>There is no  large recent influx, the rise of the alt-right faction that harbors most of these people has been having a steady growth, and feel emboldened after Trump won so they&#39;ve been more outspoken and brash. </p>

I&#39;ve always reported/flagged racist comments on Youtube (it doesn&#39;t always mean they&#39;ll be removed, but I assume that if enough of us flag them, something will come of it).  Just a few years ago, it was relatively rare to see what we sometimes see posted hundreds of times per video today.  I definitely think we&#39;re being manipulated.  Add to that companies like Cambridge Analytica openly taking credit for manipulating the masses, and it seems hard to deny.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, this is key to me--what is SEEN as racist.  People are getting fed up with people sucking at life and justifying it by calling someone else racist with no evidence.   The media is jumping all over any demonstration that supports trump as racist and they are mischaracterizing anything remotely related as racist. For instance, telling someone that black-on-black crime, black single parent family statistics, black high abortion rates, and black test scores/grades need to improve is now very racist, even if you are black.  Just let us suck at life and blame racism, don&#39;t challenge us to be better people.  Maybe calling someone racist with zero evidence should be a hate crime. You can seriously end someone&#39;s career easily with a false accusation of it.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, first off the OP never claimed racism didn&#39;t exist. Second off, I&#39;m so fucking sick of this narrative. You&#39;re only helping the divide with this bullshit. </p>

<p>Saying &quot;racism isn&#39;t as big of a problem as the media is telling you&quot; is a lot fucking different from saying &quot;there are no racist people in the world&quot;. Racism sells. It&#39;s in the benefit of a great many people to make the problem appear a lot fucking bigger than it really is. There&#39;s a reason Jessie Jackson and Al Sharpton are rich as fuck. That shit <em>sells</em>. </p>

<p>Stop with this straight-from-the-DNC talking point. It&#39;s fucking trite. It&#39;s completely possible, logical, and reasonable to believe racism isn&#39;t nearly as big of a problem as we&#39;re being told while also recognizing it still exists. </p>

<p>Saying racism isn&#39;t that bad because &quot;the KKK [isnt] still out lynching people shift oneoneone&quot; is just as asinine. Racism isn&#39;t just calling blacks niggers and fire hoses. </p>

<p>Hell racism isn&#39;t just experienced by blacks (which is what you&#39;re insinuating by bringing up Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton and the kkk cuz you&#39;re lolnotraysis). There are a plethora of ethnic groups that experience the very same blatant and subtle racism all over America.</p>

<p>And then they come here and get told that it&#39;s not that bad or it&#39;s some loldnc ploy by people who automagically assume racism only means black and white and then, again magically, play themselves the victim.</p>

<p>I believe minimizing a situation because one does not see it or equating real life issues with media hocus pocus like some in this sub loves to do is a not a view point, its a dismissal.</p>

<p>Maybe you should read the topic since you like to point out reading comprehension:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How many of you guys think that the massive influx of racism we are seeing around the internet is actually just bots or payed trolls spreading propaganda to stoke racial tensions for political reasons? Seems like the American public has totally forgotten how much we hate the establishment and are pretty focused on hating each other at this point. Once hated and vile politicians are becoming acceptable because they repudiate racism. Just seems like a complete red herring at an all too convenient time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That equates the racism that people in this country is experiencing isnt real. Its not a side of an argument. Its the end of one. Sheltered indeed. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>And yet here you are. Preaching to me that my view point is myopic even though responding to an OP who clearly states that that the influx of racism we are seeing are <em>just</em> bots and paid trolls and not just racists ass people using any excuse to be racist. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure. But what would <em>you</em> put the number at? 30k? 50k? 100k? 500k? 1 million? All those numbers are TINY compared to the population of the United States (322 million). If we use 1 million as the estimate, that&#39;s about 0.30%.. less than one third of one percent of America. </p>

<p>We can also get a look at their reach by looking at their presence online. We&#39;ll obviously look at The Daily Stormer, but we can also check Stormfront. </p>

<p>The daily stormer is ranked 2,718 on <a href="https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/dailystormer.com">Alexa</a> in the US and it &quot;only&quot; gets 63% of its traffic from the US. Stormfront is ranked 6,087 on <a href="https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/stormfront.org">Alexa</a> but only gets 53% of its traffic from the US. </p>

<p>If we compare this to &quot;small-time&quot; liberal strongholds, which frequently push the idea of &quot;white privilege&quot; (and all that other shit), that whites/men are evil, etc, it&#39;s not very favorable for the white supremacists. Mother Jones, for instance, is <a href="https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/motherjones.com">ranked</a> 1,325 with 80% from the US. Salon fares even better, <a href="https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/salon.com">ranking in</a> at 701 with 72% visitors from the US. </p>

<p>So, I ask you again -- how big do <em>you</em> estimate the white supremacists in America to be? These supposed &quot;Nazis&quot; (according to the media) had only ~40 people show up in Boston last weekend. Conservative estimates put the counter protestors at 30k. </p>

<p>IF we believe the people in Boston were &quot;Nazis&quot; (they absolutely were not), what does that say about their reach?</p>

<p>It absolutely means something different. He&#39;s saying that the <em>influx</em> of racism in the media/talking points is driven by paid actors. That&#39;s his claim.

<p>That&#39;s interesting, then, because this is that exact narrative. It&#39;s also a nice extension of the whole &quot;if you claim sexism isn&#39;t a big problem then you&#39;re sexist&quot;, which has been going on for even longer. </p>

<p><em>That</em> would be an accurate representation of my views, yes. I do not think racism is nearly as prevalent as the media is telling us it is. What we saw in Charolettesville is <em>not</em> the norm. Up until the media gave them a platform, and started telling them their president was one of them, we didn&#39;t hear a word from the White Supremacists. They were irrelevant. They still are. </p>

<p>They&#39;re like a single ant in an entire colony. When you look at the colony, that ant is pretty insignificant, even if it&#39;s the queen. It&#39;s just one ant among the thousands. However, if you put a microscope on the ant suddenly that ant seems much bigger and more relevant than it really is. </p>

<p>And (again, I hate this fucking attitude makes me have to say this), just so we&#39;re clear, I am <em>not</em> saying racism doesn&#39;t exist. I am not saying it&#39;s a good thing. I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s not terrible. I&#39;m simply stating that the problem is not nearly as wide spread as we are lead to believe. </p>

<p>I even provided you a <em>why</em> for that -- money. There&#39;s a reason &quot;White man shoots black man&quot; is national news for days, but the reverse isn&#39;t.. or even &quot;Black man shoots black man&quot;. Racism sells. It&#39;s in their best interest to stoke those flames. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Cute. Black and white issue again.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Clearly just trolling here.. unless you don&#39;t understand the significance of the NAACP and civil rights. Maybe you have a better organization I can donate to in order to combat racism? Maybe one for non-blacks? Just tell me who :) </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Was that not a mod posting?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You didn&#39;t say mod posting, you said &quot;mod message&quot;. A mod message is a very distinct thing, with a very specific meaning on reddit. It&#39;s when you send a message to the subreddit (in this case, to r/conspiracy). </p>

<li>30% comes from the left trying to &quot;fix&quot; racism (i.e. giving preferential treatment to <em>specific</em> minority groups)</li>
<li>30% is the left calling the right racism over policy disagreements because it&#39;s easier than listening.</li>
<li>30% is black people being unquestionably racist against whites.</li>
<li>8% is funny internet trolling, and this gets almost all the publicity.</li>
<li>1% is casual white racism, like a neighbor who would be extra skeptical of his daughters black boyfriend, but would also ultimately give him a chance.</li>
<li>1% is actual white against black racism, mostly from those who have had one or two bad experiences from living in the ghetto.</li>
</ul>

<p>Democrats have successfully branded the republican party the party of racists, and since they&#39;re in power it&#39;s the best tactic to delegitimize. But there&#39;s a really bad snowball effect here, in that democrats now feel 100% justified in almost anything they do, because they&#39;re fighting against nazi&#39;s, therefore all&#39;s fair. I&#39;m not sure if this was intentional (deep state divide, russia destabilize, whatever), or an unintended side effect of a party tactic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been on the tubes for while and there was <em>always</em> a huge amount of racism in the smaller corners, reddit used to have klan rallies on the weekend in many subs. The change now is that it&#39;s currently socially kind of ok to be racist out in public and in above ground internet space so it&#39;s much more visible and the media is finding it easier to report on. I don&#39;t think there is more racism I just think it&#39;s more easily seen. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Jews want a racewar. 4chan and even this place and many other &quot;conspiracy&quot; type forums made a dramatic switch from real conspiracy theories to full blown identity politics whining. Both sides are pushing the overton window further left/right to polarize the masses and create as much chaos and civil unrest as possible. Of coarse, TPTB will swoop in when the time is right and bring forth their &quot;solution&quot; to the problem (cashless society, more orwellian measures, police state, NWO)</p>

<p>The ride never ends</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, it&#39;s caused by the boomers.  Not even a conspiracy.  You see:</p>

<p>Boomers are hanging on to high paying jobs, while their skill sets are completely outdated.  The two main skills they have any claim to are nepotism with other boomers (protecting the boomer moneytrain) and senilit-er seniority.  The latter is meant to imply they may have actually seen things that could be helpful.</p>

<p>All of this would be fine if they then would turn around and mentor the next generation that graduated from college just like them.  This would create a sense of respect for them amidst the lower class.  However there are multiple problems with that.  </p>

<p>A)  The next generation has infinitely more skills due to the information age.  They are also much more moral and better leaders due to role models in media. 
B) The Boomer ego is monumental, having an enormous sense of entitlement after graduating from subsidized college into an extremely high paying real wage job.   Meanwhile Millenials experience the exact opposite</p>

<p>Therefore Boomers refuse to hire the most competent candidates, fearing that they will easily outshine them or even put their extreme lack of competence on display.</p>

<p>Instead they hire only through consulting firms, preferring candidates from developing countries, average candidates, disabled candidates, and the occasional mousy subservient candidate.</p>

<p>This makes white males mad because their extreme education capabilities (admittedly achieved through generations of legacy with epigenetic memory) are ignored and they are rejected.  Meanwhile minorities are mad because they have no chance of advancement - at OLDER white males.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. Even if you go back to the 90s, Usenet groups were horrible for it. I remember trying to download (pictures) on a 42kb modem and it turning out to be some skinhead BS propaganda.</p>

<p>Then you hit the wrong group and it was full of hate speech. </p>

<p>Early 90s there was a rash of Klan marches. Turned out to be a couple of guys wearing sheets. In one town, there was 1 man wearing the sheets marching down the street by himself surrounded by journalists and people making fun of him. </p>

<p>Also, let&#39;s not forget the rash of white supremacists they found on army bases, they used the office computers and printers to create hate speech newsletters and emails.</p>

<p>And there were still lots of real attacks though. Horrible racist attacks. One man dragged behind a pickup truck, it was all over the news. </p>

<p>I still think the incidents of hate/racial attacks are still less than just regular old crime.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have seen it.  I mean just go check the comment section of any youtube video.  Shit really started to get bad during the campaign when there were just bots spamming political shit on all sides.  Now you see the same exact technique being used but the bots are spamming either white racism or anti white racism.  Giant Swastikas...  so forth.  Sure some if it is probably edgy kids, and that has always been a factor.  But there has been an extremely big boost in racism, particularly spam style stuff.</p>
