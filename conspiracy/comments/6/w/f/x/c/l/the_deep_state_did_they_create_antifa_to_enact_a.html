<p>The Police State is just one or two dead protesters away(and the left already have their martyr) from all out conflict with the government. Is this what they wanted?</p>

<p>I am sure it feels more sensational to think the big bad deep state paid those people to distract from recent events. But if you just do a LITTLE bit of research you will see that those left wing radicals are neither a recent group nor have they been inactive over the last decades.</p>

<p>If you are looking for a conspiracy you might find a better one in why they are suddenly on the media everywhere... maybe the media are trying to distract. But those radical antifa nutjobs sure as hell have been there all the time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, violence at protests and demonstrations is deliberate and planned.  By the cops.  There is an agenda to outlaw protest and demonstration.  Its the pro police agenda.</p>

<p>Antifa is a red herring here, not just because the narrative of them being constantly violant is caused by media manipulation, but because that same sort of false, protestor blaming narrative happens every time there&#39;s a protest movement in the streets against the establishment.  Same things been done to BLM, to Occupy, to everyone before, because when police instigate violence against the left the media blames the left.</p>

<p>Eliminate every individual right. The one under attack now is the right to protest and demonstrate.  </p>

<p>It is a conservative goal so it must be blamed on &quot;leftists,&quot; and Democrats. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s interesting that this sub believes in the year 2017 that racism, injustice, and discrimination was going to go unchecked.</p>

<p>It&#39;s more interesting the lengths this sub will go to distant themselves from &quot;nazis&quot; but racism from &quot;nazis&quot; as if there was a difference. </p>

<p>Bitches about the media but just rehashes fake news to further inflate the ego.</p>

<p>Honestly how do you &quot;subciously vicariously&quot; defend &quot;nazis&#39;&quot;??</p>

<p>Antifa is the biggest &quot;problem&quot; yet all of you act like racism isn&#39;t real? But you&#39;re conspiracies are real?</p>

<p>Also a lot of people are chalking it up to be just some small fraction of america when in actuality you&#39;re all subconciously picking sides.</p>

<p>Also fuck the police. They&#39;re against you. The system was always corrupted. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks, it is the name the south called it. It is the way the they felt at the time, the aggressors(North) were taxing and regulating them into poverty. It did have some to do with slavery, but mostly not. Mostly it was about states, to have the right, to make their own laws, hence &quot;states rights&quot; became the term of the time. I believe that term will resurface if Sessions continues his war on pot. I also surmise that was the deep state plan along, why else would a deep south senator attach himself to a long shot northern candidate from the get go?</p>
