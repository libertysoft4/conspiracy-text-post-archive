<p>Never blame themselves, but instead blame the oppressive male. Also coincidentally, happen to be less physically attractive.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Men cannot be feminists. Equality does not exist because we have different hormones. Humans have animal instincts and if you inject women with 200mg+ of testosterone/week they will adopt male instincts. Put men on estrogen and they will adopt womanly instincts.</p>

<p>If biological differences exist there cannot be equality. There can be social or moral or (x) equality but it must be employed recognizing the animal instincts and nature of men and women. To ignore that is to ignore Natural Law.</p>

<p>Men pretending to be feminists end up confronted with their animal instinct eventually, and most <a href="http://www.thecrimson.com/column/femme-fatale/article/2017/3/23/hu-beware-male-feminist/">fail</a>, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2017/08/22/hypocrite-preaching-feminist-ideals-director-joss-whedons-ex-wife-accuses-him-of-cheating/?utm_term=.9074c3264ca5">or fail spectacularly</a></p>

<p>To frame it in allegory, when the Scorpion asks the Frog to cross the river on its back, and swears it merely wants to travel, but stings it mid-way and both will perish, the frog asks &quot;why&quot;, the Scorpion responds &quot;it&#39;s in my nature&quot;....</p>

<p>Prenteding men are biologically, intellectually and instinctually the same as women is to pretend a Scorpion is a Frog. This creates incredible division for both men and women who fall for the meme.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Rights and protections are not dictated by an authority but by the understanding of those who invoke their rights as authority. They are dictated by the culture and the individual. To change the culture requires something more than edicts.</p>

<p>Women have had advantageous protections in years past. They were not subject to Military Draft. They were not taxed. They were not socially confined to dangerous work (which even with feminism the statistical numbers have not risen in such occupations). </p>

<p>If you check Census Data as far back as 1900s you will find women employed in non-traditionally female roles as well. It&#39;s not that they were never allowed or considered for certain roles, but vary few even attempted or sought those. The numbers haven&#39;t really changed much. There&#39;s still an overwhelming majority in Nursing, Teaching, and other female associated professions.</p>

<p>Feminism is not based in reality, it&#39;s based in emotional appeal and was originally funded by the CIA and other subversive operations. The first <em>wave</em> was somewhat reasonable (although probably planned to be modest in its inception), the second and third wave was mind programming - promotion of mental illness. </p>

<p>Women were far more powerful before feminism became intertwined as a cultural value. Women dictate the ability and quality of men in the tribe or social sphere. When they stop requiring men to <em>provide</em> and meet biological standards [mating - marriage], they encourage the animalistic nature of men to plant seed and dispose of them.</p>

<p>They in turn get used and left behind adhering to some ignorant belief in an ideological Zeitgeist. The biological nature of men is to spread seed as much as possible until an <em>intelligent</em> women reigns their animal-idiot-self in and demands/forces them into submission. This is the most advantageous, righteous and powerful position a women could ever obtain, but they pass it up for a false belief ignoring natural instinct makes them complete in some way.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a reason why women were used as spies and assassins in history. They are a force, but only when they use the natural instincts they were given. In short, to manipulate men. They are still manipulating men by pushing them into accepting feminist ideals, but those ideals do not meet the Nature within men, so they will never be fully respected.</p>
