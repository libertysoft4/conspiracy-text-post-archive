<p>People been happening literally forever, if they ever made it much past this point of development, if they ever made it into deep space, if star trek ever happened rl, our skies would have looked like alien new York since before there were humans.  There&#39;s no maybe this or maybe that, it&#39;s been forever.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fair point. My only argument to this would be, ships have been photographed. Out of the millions of photos that have been taken of &quot;alien craft&quot; I believe some of them have to show the truth. In regards to photographing alien life, we have no idea what aliens would look like. They could look exactly like us but have 7 livers. Who knows. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You just made an unverified claim, as obvious as it may seem that there may be aliens you cannot make such claims. That&#39;s equivocal to saying there is a God I just haven&#39;t met said god. Either one is a unverified claim. I&#39;m definitely interested and hope there are aliens O should say this, no one knows either way of there are or if there aren&#39;t but logic would suggest there would be, still doesn&#39;t mean that there is for certain.

    <div class="md"><p>One can argue you are plenty unverified yourself.</p>

<p>You ain&#39;t ever gonna meet any aliens because it&#39;s been forever.  If star trek ever happened rl, ever, our skies would have had aliens just as soon as it was safe to come into our solar system.</p>

<p>It&#39;s been forever, shit didn&#39;t somehow magically start from nothing to our big bang, endless, infinite energy and matter already existed.  You can&#39;t get something from nothing and the only other answer is matter and energy already existed, must have existed with no beginning and will forever, no end.</p>

<p>Just cuz that one little slice of common sense- you nor anyone else can snap tour fingers and make something from nothing.  </p>

<p>So infinite matter and energy been making infinite people for forever already, it&#39;s just that star trek never happens rl, and the only reason is cuz life never gets past this level of tech development.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t have two years left of living like you do.  And gods a real thing.  Take a little time and effort to show ya but gods even right here on Reddit.</p>

<p>The alien stuffs just common sense.  Rest of it, be too hard to show you, you didn&#39;t read the thread before replying.  Dead giveaway, yer just lookin for someone to &#39;refute&#39;.  I&#39;ll pass.</p>
