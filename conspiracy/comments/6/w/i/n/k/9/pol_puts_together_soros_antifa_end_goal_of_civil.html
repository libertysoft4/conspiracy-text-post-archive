        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>-The alt-left domestic terrorist groups are going to become ultra violent soon and attempt the implementation of a communist regime by means of violent revolution with the full blessing of the MSM in the USA.</p>

<p>-I can prove my words, read on for 5 more minutes until the end and you&#39;ll see this is true.</p>

<p>-The alt-left domestic terrorist far-left groups are LYING to everyone by telling the general public they only attack Nazis, but in reality, they label anyone who disagrees with their violent far-left Marxist ideology as a Nazi and then incite violence against them.</p>

<p>-See here the Mayor of Berkeley calling a female trans-sexual female patriot who disavows the KKK and the Nazis being labeled a White Supremacists because she organizes an anti-Marxist protest: <a href="https://farleftwatch.com/2017/08/25/berkeley-mayor-labels-march-against-marxism-a-white-nationalist-rally/">https://farleftwatch.com/2017/08/25/berkeley-mayor-labels-march-against-marxism-a-white-nationalist-rally/</a></p>

<p>-See here 5 examples of 5 times Antifa attacked someone who wasn&#39;t a Nazi: <a href="https://farleftwatch.com/2017/08/22/5-times-antifa-attacked-someone-who-wasnt-a-nazi/">https://farleftwatch.com/2017/08/22/5-times-antifa-attacked-someone-who-wasnt-a-nazi/</a></p>

<p>-All these groups are communist. They LIE all the time by telling the general public they are just anti-Nazi, anti-KKK, but that is just part of their false narrative to justify and normalize violence against anyone who they label as a Nazi or KKK member, and they label anyone who disagrees with them on anything as a Nazi or KKK and then incite violence against all opposition based on that label they put on all their opposition.</p>

<p>-Far left militia group, Redneck Revolt, offers training manual on “kidnapping”, “executions”, and “terrorism”: <a href="https://farleftwatch.com/2017/07/26/far-left-militia-training-for-guerrilla-warfare/">https://farleftwatch.com/2017/07/26/far-left-militia-training-for-guerrilla-warfare/</a></p>

<p>This is all hard evidence that a communist revolution is taking place in the USA, and the media has chosen its side. CNN doesn&#39;t give a crap if the alt-left are violent monsters who undermine the government. They&#39;ve picked their side, and they will remain on the side of Antifa and the other alt-left domestic terrorist far-left groups until the war is over.... however that turns out. </p>

<p>Do not underestimate them. They have the support of government officials (Mayor of Berkeley for example), communist institutions (like ADL),communist judges, communist teachers and school officials, and off course, the (((MSM))). This makes for a very asymmetric warfare.</p>

<p>And just because they look, act like and are losers, does not mean they can&#39;t be dangerous, because in fact, they are dangerous. The clown in pic related here, is clearly committed, so, can you imagine if some ISIS operative (which they have connections with) hands him a chemical agent and their Antifa leaders order him to go put it in a air ventilation or conditioning system of a building were only Trump supporters or other of &quot;Nazis/White Supremacists/KKK members&quot; (aka, anyone who isn&#39;t a Marxists) are working or living, do you doubt he will do it? And everyone to the right of Marx is a &quot;Nazis/White Supremacists/KKK member&quot; for this people. They are losers, dangerous losers which are getting trained and have connection to ISIS, Venezuela&#39;s Nicholas Maduro communist regime and Weather Underground co-founder Bill Ayers.</p>

<p>They are going to start a civil war. Mark my words, they will try it.</p>
