<p><strong>Duplicity</strong></p>

<p>“Knowing can be a curse on a person&#39;s life. I&#39;d traded in a pack of lies for a pack of truth, and I didn&#39;t know which one was heavier. Which one took the most strength to carry around? It was a ridiculous question, though, because once you know the truth, you can&#39;t ever go back and pick up your suitcase of lies. Heavier or not, the truth is yours now.” ― Sue Monk Kidd, The Secret Life of Bees</p>

<p>Most of us live a double life. If you are on this subreddit, reading this, then it is likely you have to paint a variety of faces throughout the day, just to make it through the day. Whatever your political beliefs, whatever your religious beliefs, and whatever you think about Trump, you are here because you know something is awfully wrong with the world. The one way we are all united here is that we have realized that reality is not what it seems, and we want to find the truth. As we peel away the layers of reality, we start to see fragments of the truth, and we can no longer be who we were before. Do you remember yourself before you started your journey toward truth?</p>

<p>Duplicity is defined as deceitfulness, or double-dealing. If you are the one fortunate soul who is able to go through life as truly yourself, I am envious. As for the rest of us, I have no doubt we must pretend to be something we are not on a daily basis. </p>

<p>Recently, I went to a conference, and as kind of an icebreaker, we had to discuss a historical event that had great impact on our lives. Undoubtedly, the majority brought up 9/11 (I’d say 24/25), and with tear-filled eyes, they talked about the impact of that day. They talked about how we united as a country that day.
I smiled, and nodded, but what was I supposed to do – talk about how 9/11 was an inside job or some type of occult ritual? Yeah, right. I felt like Winston from 1984 as I smiled compassionately at those in the room.</p>

<p>Now, even if you are somehow reading this and do not think 9/11 is an inside job, the point is that we are all burdened by this other side of reality we have found. We have one foot in reality, and one foot in fiction daily, and I feel that this duplicity is ultimately damaging to our minds and souls, and like anything else, I realized that this is all intentional.</p>

<p><strong>Our Little Corner</strong></p>

<p>I stick to a few subs on Reddit, but the other day, I ventured into one of the major subs. There was an article about Trump, and I left a pretty neutral comment (not pro, not anti, just in between). Within milliseconds, I had 15 downvotes (not kidding), and I had about 6 users attacking me. Of course, you all know that’s how it works on Reddit, but then it hit me. ‘They’ want that to happen. They want us to retreat to our little corner of the internet, where we feel like we have free speech, but we do not.</p>

<p>More than ever, we are losing places that we can truly speak out. Sure, you can leave the comment on <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>, but who will really see it? If it doesn’t fit the narrative, it is not going to matter. So, we come back to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> or maybe an associated sub, and we post here. Even here though, there is tons of division, and you never even really know if anybody is listening, or just waiting for their opportunity to speak. This is perfectly part of controlled opposition – they make us feel that we have this freedom to speak out, but do we really? Is it really freedom if nobody can access what we are saying anyway? Is it really freedom when there is so much propaganda, disinfo, misinfo, etc. that we are not even really sure what the truth is? Ultimately, illusion of freedom of speech is a way to stifle dissent:</p>

<p><a href="http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/illusion-of-freedom-of-speech-is-a-way-to-stifle-dissent-shashi-tharoor/articleshow/56098724.cms">http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/illusion-of-freedom-of-speech-is-a-way-to-stifle-dissent-shashi-tharoor/articleshow/56098724.cms</a></p>

<p>Do you see the duplicity of “freedom of speech?” Shashi Tharoor (from the article) explains,</p>

<p>“There are many ways dissent can be stifled. The old fashioned school of locking people up and sending them to concentration camps but the other way is getting employers to hound them for instance. The more insidious and sophisticated ways are more dangerous because they preserve the illusion of freedom of speech.”</p>

<p>Again, we have one foot in reality, and on foot in fiction at all times.</p>

<p><strong>Examples of Duplicity in Our Lives</strong></p>

<p>Perhaps the biggest example of duplicity in our lives is social media. Social media is a mask and a façade for most of us. Most of us use some type of social media, and I would say even Reddit falls under the social media category. We are literally living our lives through different filters.  There has been study after study done on the façade of happiness and social media:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/facade-social-media-happiness-jp-slater">https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/facade-social-media-happiness-jp-slater</a></p>

<p>This may seem kind of simple, but even think about Snapchat. There are filters on Snapchat to transform how we look – some which make you look better, and some which turn you into an entirely different being of existence. Even when taking a simple photo of ourselves, we do not want to see who we really are – what we really look like. Here is an article on how these filters distort our self-images:</p>

<p><a href="http://college.usatoday.com/2016/08/18/fight-the-filter-snapchat-selfies-distort-users-self-image/">http://college.usatoday.com/2016/08/18/fight-the-filter-snapchat-selfies-distort-users-self-image/</a></p>

<p>Even Instagram is a tool to filter reality – to make it look cleaner, more vibrant. The point is that there are thousands of apps to filter our realities into something you want. </p>

<p>But this goes deeper. On social media, we can always filter our audience. If you have Facebook, you can ensure that your friends are people who all agree with you, your lifestyle choices, and your political views. </p>

<p>The claim, that we are more connected than ever, is actually an illusion, too. Study after study shows us how social media makes us more isolated and more narrow-minded:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/22/health/facebook-study-narrow-minded-trnd/index.html">http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/22/health/facebook-study-narrow-minded-trnd/index.html</a></p>

<p>Even if you are not into social media, think about all of the ways we are constantly creating duplicity in our lives. We have two or more realities, and we are always shifting in and out of those. Perhaps you use drugs and alcohol to escape reality. Maybe you are obsessed with material items that make your life seem more grandiose. It does not have to be big though. Maybe it is as simple as putting on makeup in the morning and becoming another person. Or maybe you smile at a stranger on the street, but you feel like you are dying inside. The point is, we are all living different levels of deception, some greater than others. 
This is not to ridicule anyone. In fact, it is a survival mechanism, really. I mean, how can we truly be ourselves in reality today? </p>

<p>Going back to my original point, if you are on this subreddit, then it is probably harder than ever before. </p>

<p><strong>Duplicity and Mental Health</strong></p>

<p>It is not surprise that mental health is a huge problem in the United States, and I feel like more and more mental health issues are being normalized. Not surprisingly, studies support the fact that mental health issues are on the rise:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.antioch.edu/auonline/2017/03/03/mental-health-issues-america-rise-2/">https://www.antioch.edu/auonline/2017/03/03/mental-health-issues-america-rise-2/</a></p>

<p>While the reasons are multi-faceted, I have no doubt that the double lives we lead are bad for our mental health. Let’s think about why so many people are depressed and anxious</p>

<p>1)  Unrealistic Standards – We all have somebody to constantly compare ourselves to – from the social media friend to the celebrity with the perfect body. We are constantly being told we are not good enough, and the reason is always clear. We are not beautiful enough. We are not young enough. We are not smart enough. So, we have the self we are not happy with constantly fighting with the self we want to be. </p>

<p>Psychology Today writes,  “Our expectations are too high, probably because of the emphasis on “you can be anything you want to be” and highly positive self-views.”</p>

<p><a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/our-changing-culture/201410/why-so-many-people-are-stressed-and-depressed">https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/our-changing-culture/201410/why-so-many-people-are-stressed-and-depressed</a></p>

<p>We told we can be and do anything, but isn’t that the ultimate lie?</p>

<p>2)  Working for nothing – Then, we are told that if we just work hard enough, our lives will be better, fuller, and richer. Most of us are over-worked, and I am not saying this is by choice. The more we work, the more money/stuff we will have, but the less time we really have to spend on life and the enjoyable aspects of life. We have a “cult of overwork” in the United States (and around the world): </p>

<p><a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/01/27/the-cult-of-overwork">http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/01/27/the-cult-of-overwork</a></p>

<p>There is the paradox the more we work, the happier we will ultimately be. </p>

<p>3)  We have weaker ties with others – The relationships you have online just cannot compare to relationships in real life, but those are becoming more and more rare. There is an epidemic of loneliness – we are more connected than ever, but we are more lonely in real life:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/features/the-loneliness-epidemic-more-connected-than-ever-but-feeling-more-alone-10143206.html">http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/features/the-loneliness-epidemic-more-connected-than-ever-but-feeling-more-alone-10143206.html</a></p>

<p>Do you see the paradoxes, the duplicity? The outer shell we present to the world is nothing like our inner shell. </p>

<p>Some of us do start exploring our inner selves, but they thought of that, too…</p>

<p><strong>Live Well, but Remember, Nothing Really Matters</strong></p>

<p>I have written a lot about nihilism lately, but I really want you to think about this statement. Live well, but remember, nothing really matters. That seems to be the message society is sending us, and doesn’t it seem contradictory?</p>

<p>More and more, we are being told that there is no God – there is nothing beyond us. For example, atheism is on the rise:</p>

<p><a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/04/160422-atheism-agnostic-secular-nones-rising-religion/">http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/04/160422-atheism-agnostic-secular-nones-rising-religion/</a></p>

<p>Nihilistic attitudes in general are on the rise, as well. While nihilism is nothing new, Vella writes,</p>

<p>“The economic and cultural decline of egalitarian western societies which began in the latter half of the 20th century, known as Postmodernity, has given rise to nihilistic thinking characterized by populist discontent and disillusionment especially amongst the young. This is hardly surprising since negativism and pessimism are the natural result of lost educational and occupational opportunities particularly when the bulk of one’s life lies ahead. At no time during the last eight decades, for example, has the level of distrust in America’s social institutions been so high. Growing nihilism, however, doesn’t just pose a threat to an entrenched establishment; it also threatens to rob the vitality and potential prosperity from an entire population.”</p>

<p><a href="https://thesecularjurist.wordpress.com/2015/08/10/dystopia-and-the-rise-of-nihilism/">https://thesecularjurist.wordpress.com/2015/08/10/dystopia-and-the-rise-of-nihilism/</a></p>

<p>I have written much about nihilism in pop culture if you are interested by the way:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6umt98/does_your_life_matter_the_ultimate_conspiracy/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6umt98/does_your_life_matter_the_ultimate_conspiracy/</a></p>

<p>The ultimate conspiracy, in my opinion, is that they want you to believe your life does not matter. They want you to believe that life is meaningless. Yet, they want you to live as if your life is meaningful. Do you see the paradox again?</p>

<p>More and more subscribe to the worldview that there is nothing beyond themselves, beyond this physical reality, yet they are supposed to live as life is perfect and meaningful, and wonderful. It kind of reminds me how they also say that something suddenly came from nothing, that our entire universe came from nothing at all:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20141106-why-does-anything-exist-at-all">http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20141106-why-does-anything-exist-at-all</a></p>

<p>Whatever your spiritual beliefs, there seems to be an “Unbearable Lightness of Being.” This is one of my favorite books, and the author writes,</p>

<p>“The goals we pursue are always veiled. A girl who longs for marriage longs for something she knows nothing about. The boy who hankers after fame has no idea what fame is. The thing that gives our every move its meaning is always totally unknown to us.”</p>

<p>We all seem to be living this life for meaning, but some of do not know what that ultimate meaning is. What if we are living for the wrong things (we likely are!)</p>

<p>But even sadder, is that many have stopped searching for that truth or meaning. They have become nihilists, and they do not want to go any further.</p>

<p>The rise of scientism seems to support this materialistic worldview, that we live life for no purpose, and it is all meaningless.  </p>

<p><strong>Breaking Our Paradigms</strong></p>

<p>We all have paradigms. In science and philosophy, a paradigm is a distinct set of concepts or thought patterns, including theories, research methods, postulates, and standards for what constitutes legitimate contributions to a field. In other words, we all have a distinct set of thought patterns that are formed by our experiences and perspectives over time: </p>

<p> 1) Paradigms can be both good and bad. Paradigms filter incoming data so that you can see what you need to see effectively and efficiently. </p>

<p> 2) But, you might fail to correctly interpret data and cometo the right conclusion. Unfortunately, You may unconsciously distort data to fit your paradigm</p>

<p> 3) You are blinded and confined by your own paradigm</p>

<p> 4) Yet, you are convinced that you are right</p>

<p><a href="http://www.watertown.k12.wi.us/faculty/wattsp/paradigmandimagination.ppt">www.watertown.k12.wi.us/faculty/wattsp/paradigmandimagination.ppt</a></p>

<p>Then how does a paradigm shift happen? Through revolutionary thought. </p>

<p>What happens in these subreddits, is that we are all looking for justification and evidence for our paradigms. Even though we may have “woken up” on many levels, new thoughts get caught in the filter of paradigms. </p>

<p>For example, today I saw a post that said, “Dinosaurs do not exist.” So just for a moment, let that thought go through your paradigm filter system. Which of these fits your reaction?</p>

<p>1)  Ridiculous. Not worth the time.
2)  I already know that – do not need to explore further.
3)  That doesn’t fit my paradigm, but I’m interested in what the post is about.
4)  I don’t care.</p>

<p>None of those answers are “right” or “wrong”, but which is most open? Now, before anybody says I believe dinosaurs do not exist – stop right there. You are missing the point. That is not what I am saying. I decided to watch the video.</p>

<p>It was decent. I didn’t come to the conclusion that dinosaurs did not exist; however, I did learn some pretty interesting and suspicious things about fossils, but even then I have to be careful. I have to deeply examine the evidence of the video. I can’t just conclude the video is true (which many people do!)
The point is, I allowed my paradigm to be challenged, without necessarily saying I agree or disagree.</p>

<p>Not only are many conspiracy related subs (or places on the internet) simply controlled opposition, but then, they are a place for people to validate their paradigms, not necessarily challenge them.</p>

<p>I am not saying everybody is like this, but do you see the duplicity again? Many of us claim to be truth-seekers, yet we would never even allow an alternative viewpoint to challenge us. So there lies the danger. Many of us feel we have found the ultimate truth, and we stop, and remain stagnant.  The term for this is paradigm paralysis:</p>

<p>“Paradigm paralysis. Perhaps the greatest barrier to a paradigm shift, in some cases, is the reality of paradigm paralysis: the inability or refusal to see beyond the current models of thinking. This is similar to what psychologists term Confirmation bias.”</p>

<p>In other words, we close our minds, but we are under the guise that we are open-minded truth-seekers.</p>

<p>Just to note that I am not saying that we should agree with everyone and everything. In an age of propaganda, disinfo, misinfo, shills, etc., it is really hard to even determine what is possibly true. All I am saying is that many of us have this duplicity of an open/close mind. We are open to data that supports what we already think, but we are closed to data that challenges what we think.</p>

<p><em>We Don’t Know What We Don’t Know</em></p>

<p>I heard somebody say that recently, and I think it is true. There is so much more to learn, and I hope that none of us become stagnant. In fact, we do not even know what we don’t know yet.</p>

<p><strong>Breaking Double Mindedness</strong></p>

<p>Unfortunately, we all still probably have to live this double-minded life, but perhaps we can slowly break it.</p>

<p>For me, the best way I have found to do this is honestly simple: to be kind to others. I know that sounds corny and stupid, but let me explain.</p>

<p>If you have ever attempted to talk about the “truth” with anybody, most of the time it is futile. People are stuck in their paradigms, and it is truly hard to break those paradigms.
But, one thing I have found is that people, no matter who they are, still look up to good, kind people. When you are truly kind, and you are living out a philosophy of helping others as much as you can, people do see that. Our thoughts do matter, and so do our actions. The more that our thoughts and actions correlate, the less double-minded we are. If we want the world to be a better place, it starts with us.</p>

<p>I’m not saying the world is going to change over night, but I am saying the way you treat others is the ultimate truth to who you really are. Even how you interact with people online is a testament to who you truly are. I mean, there are actual studies that prove our actions speak louder than words:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/08/130808123723.htm">https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/08/130808123723.htm</a></p>

<p>So, when I see the homeless guy on the street, am I going to discuss 9/11 with him, or am I going to give him some food? Maybe I’ll bring some food, and then we can talk about 9/11
.
The point is that so many get so caught up in their political paradigms, that we forget that people are still ruled by human nature. The best way to wake people up is to show them how the world <strong>should be</strong>.</p>

<p>I work with so many teachers who complain and complain and complain. Yeah, trust me I get it, but I stopped complaining (I mean I still do), but I started acting. I can’t change the system, but I can help change those around me. I can change the environment I create daily. I’m in charge of my reality, and maybe I can help people shift theirs, too.</p>

<p>And ultimately, being kind and helping others seems to do the trick. The more I do that, the more positive my world has become. </p>

<p>By the way, I’m not saying I’m perfect, or never double-minded, but the more I tried to synch my views on making the world a better place with my actual actions, well, my world ultimately became a better place.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>The point is that this duplicity is not healthy for us. Even the bible states,</p>

<p>“Such a person is double-minded and unstable in all they do.” (James 1:8)</p>

<p>The more there is a disconnect between our actual thoughts and the reality we live, the more likely that we suffer.</p>

<p>We must make an attempt to be “real”, in a world that is manufactured to make us superficial, disconnected, and hateful.
I encourage you to look for the real version of yourself. Who is that person? Are you disconnected from it? Why? What can you do to start becoming “you” again?</p>

<p>I am not saying that we will not still have to put on a show some times…we still have to live. I’m sure you have heard the Zen quote:</p>

<p>&quot;Before enlightenment, chop wood, carry water. After enlightenment, chop wood, carry water.&quot;</p>

<p>But also remember the Buddha said,</p>

<p>“A wise man, recognizing that the world is but an illusion, does not act as if it is real, so he escapes the suffering.” Buddha
I think we should start breaking our paradigms, that trap us into this illusion of reality (as much as possible). We should continue to seek the truth, and through our journey, we should do what we can to be kind, help others, and make this world a better place.</p>

<p>And maybe, if we do this, we could truly unite. </p>

<p>Until then, I look to Christ as my model for how to live in this world, and even if you do not agree with my spiritual views, really think about this. Matter is 99% empty:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/99-9999999-of-your-body-is-empty-space">https://www.sciencealert.com/99-9999999-of-your-body-is-empty-space</a></p>

<p>The Buddha (and other spiritual leaders) already told us reality was an illusion (long before you were born). Yet, we insist on living the façade, when material life itself is actually not even “real.”</p>

<p>So, all we can really do is seek the truth, and continue to find what is real…what isn’t actually empty.</p>

<p>Note: This post took me about an hour and half to write, so before you downvote, discuss. I write because</p>

<p>1)  I want to connect with people
2)  Maybe it will help me break some paradigms, myself
3)  I love writing
4)  I love helping people through writing
5)  Writing helps, me too.

    <div class="md"><p>Excellently written piece. IMO you came very close to hitting the nail on the head. The truth is not a static idea that one can grasp after learning &quot;x&quot; or experiencing &quot;y&quot;.  The entire point is to never stop questioning the &quot;Truth&quot;. The truth is the journey not the destination! </p>

<p>I believe you are correct that we all live duplicitous lives, to our own detriment. I also believe that the cause and solution are one and the same; the test of truth is in your heart. Your attitude about synching the internal and external expressions are absolutely correct. The purpose is to change the internal expression to affect the external expression. The duplicitous mask is to protect the fragile spiritual state an Alchemist will find him or herself in around the general public (meat for strong minds and milk for babes!) while making the internal changes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for this beautiful writeup! Compassion is surely one of the greatest virtues, as it allows for the dissolving of paradigms and the opening to the diversity of life and it&#39;s possibilities. I have been making a conscious effort to align my actions with love and compassion and dissolve my paradigms for several years and have been opened up to the vastness of human experience exponentially. </p>

<p>I have been trying to look at reality and it&#39;s course as series of adjacent rooms with doors. When we act with compassion and love, we open the doors to anything and in turn consciously will ourselves into freedom from paradigms. Our silly mind makes us worry about opening to all of experience and the negative that can come from it, but if intentions are pure and in accordance with compassion, you will not feel the pain or suffering that your old &#39;self&#39; may have felt by being beyond the mind, present, and transcendent of the limitations of the mind. </p>

<p>A frame of mind that helps me to be compassionate and act with love is to think of everyone, everything, and all action as a product of circumstance. Everyone and their formed minds are in large part conditioned composite of their environmental upbringings. This took a long time for me to come to terms with, especially around people that commit serious crimes against others. In the rear view, it has been a tremendous weight off my shoulders. My cognitive dissonance surrounding a righteousness paradigm vs. Unconditional love and acceptance for all has been alleviated. I have chosen love :)</p>

<p>If you are looking for more research on the mentality of duplicity, &#39;cognitive dissonance&#39; is a great psych buzz phrase that means feeling conflicted about acting in a way that is not in line with what you know to be good and true.</p>

<p>I saved your post so I can look back to it :) may we continue this important conversation until we all Breathe as one. Much love, fellow traveller :)</p>

<p>This quote from David Lynch has been resonating with me: &quot;We are like the dreamers who dream, and then live inside the dream. But who is the dreamer?&quot; </p>

I don&#39;t want to attack your beliefs or anything but it&#39;s strange to have the opinion that we are lied to about almost everything yet somehow the Bible and Christianity are legit. Even in terms of looking into conspiracy theories you can find entire books by sensible people on how and when the bible was altered to manipulate entire populations.

    <div class="md"><p>Jesus couldve been groomed to be the perfect manipulator, or he couldve never existed and he&#39;s just a figment of a fictional text. Or he couldve been the son of God for all we know, but one of the reasons i cant buy into the bible is that it doesnt account for the evolution of man/life on Earth. You&#39;d think god would relay some more pertinent information about life as we know it, if he was gonna tell us anything at all. Then again, &quot;god&quot; could just be another manipulator exploiting weak human minds.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Im trying to say that taking christ away makes it even more valid</p>

<p>I feel adding the bible adds a huge bias to your paradigm. </p>

<p>Facts are we are on a regular planet, in a regular solar system, surrounding a regular-small sized star, in a regular sized galaxy, with no noticeable help from celestial beings since before our records could be verified. To me it&#39;s more likely humans made holy books in order to create docile populations. Not a bad thing inherently, but if thats true then the bedrock of most of our understanding is a lie. A well-intentioned one, maybe, but still untrue.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think christ is a good example to look up to, because he is literally a symbol of unconditional love. But i think unconditional love is something we should strive for as a species, and not something that is at all inherent to the nature of existence. Christ is the embodiment of all the good we can do with the immense power we have as conscious human beings, but he is not a reflection of the universe&#39;s love for us. Existence is harsh, resources are scarce, its up to humans to elevate our species, and praying to a god is, in my opinion, counterproductive. Im not saying that people dont benefit from a sense of security that religion provides, but there are better things we could be doing as a species.

    <div class="md"><p>I definitely agree. But i feel like prayer is, a lot of the time, people asking god for an answer or something along those lines. When i meditate, i focus deeply on whatever has been bothering me, with the hopes of coming up with a course of action. A lot of the time the best course i can see is to just accept and let things play out. But after you&#39;ve gone through all of that acceptance, youre shooting for the astral planes/lucid dreaming. Those experiences can be far more transcendent than common prayer.</p>
