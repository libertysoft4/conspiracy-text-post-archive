        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I am 48yo and unabashed history buff. I remember the Iran hostage crisis and looked for updates every night on the tv news. 444 days. (I even changed channels between ABC, NBC CBS to see if they were telling the same narrative. Although I didn&#39;t know what a narrative was until I researched the NASA moonlanding hoax, decades later.)</p>

<p>I remember asking my Mom in December of 1972 if she thought the moon landings were real. Her response was &quot;Well, it was on tv so...&quot; </p>

<p>I went through high school listening to history teachers who regurgitated everything from text books.</p>

<p>But I had one really good high school teacher who did Current Events. He woke me up to what the world news was really about. What was happening in Central America during the Reagan years. My mind was blown but I didn&#39;t go into conspiracies just yet.</p>

<p>So I watched the Iran-Contra hearings on tv every day. Fawn Hall was hot, Oliver North was respectable but too loyal for my liking. I did not think the official narrative was believable yet it was the official narrative so I took that to the bank. (I justified this by thinking that a jurat would imply they weren&#39;t lying, although, I later realized that people will lie under penalties of perjury if they are offered a good escape plan.)</p>

<p>Being a history nerd I went to a local community college and took all the history classes. Totally stunned by the new narratives I was getting. (Worldbook encyclopedia didn&#39;t cut the mustard, these teachers, filling me up with new narratives, blew my mind.) Then I ran out of college money and enlisted in the military for the benefits of world travel and work experience.</p>

<p>So I enlisted. Served my time, like an indentured servant, but I took a lot of valuable experience with me when I decided to not re-up. </p>

<p>Then I chased the capitalist wet dream for 25 years. Fucking credit cards, car loans, mortgages, marriage, divorce, saying &quot;yes&quot; to the boss when the real answer was &quot;no&quot;.</p>

<p>That&#39;s what you call a mundane conspiracy and I think a lot of conspiracy folk are focussing on conspiracy like it is some kind of celebrity tv show. It&#39;s NOT!</p>

<p>Mundane conspiracies happen every single day! And every day is exactly the same!</p>

<p>I watched the Abu Graihb torture hearings.  Rumsfeld was unvelievable , to my surprise racist Senator Robert Byrd really took him to task. Did you know that Rummy and Wolfy had visited Abu Graihb months before the scandal but they only visited the parts of the prison where Saddam had allegedly tortured people, but, conveniently, Rummy and Wolfy never went to the parts of the prison complex where torture was actually happening. </p>

<p>I know enough to know that <a href="/r/AskHistorians">/r/AskHistorians</a> is a scam, a gatekeepers wet dream, don&#39;t go there for answers.</p>

<p>The moon hoax debate occupied my idle brain cycles for about 3 years. That was when I really understood the power of good narrative. NASA defenders also respect the power of a good narrative, that&#39;s why they stick to the CIA narrative and win arguments when they should be called out for ignorance.</p>

<p>Then I discovered the Mae Brussell archives and listened to about 10 years worth of her tapes, the Nixon-Nazi narrative, and general historical research. That is a free education in conspiracy theory and worth every second. (She was worn out after 10 years but kept going, possible attacks on her family, and by god I was feeling pretty depressed about conspiracies, official narratives and cover-ups that I could not get past the Jonestown Massacre or the John Lennon assassination because I felt as helpless as a newborn babe.)</p>

<p>After 9/11 all bets were off. I knew it was a hoax as soon as I saw the news reports that morning.</p>

<p>So I decided the best way to beat the Big Conspiracies  (JFK, MLK, RFK, moon landings, 9/11, etc) was to engage myself with the lowest level conspiracies I could find. At my work, in Big Telecom. And I found them aplenty.</p>

<p>And those would be the mundane conspiracies that happen to us every single day. Those are the conspiracies where where somebody &quot;covers up&quot; what somebody else does wrong.  Knowing that is wrong they do it anyway... as a loyal servant, so they won&#39;t get fired on the next downsizing.</p>

<p>Loyalty to a paycheck or an ultimate payoff is all you need to get a conspiracy rolling. And it&#39;s very easy to convince low level managers of corporations to comply. I have seen it over and over again. Capitalism isn&#39;t real... the only economics is Gangster Economics, pay-for-play, suck a dick for a bonus, I think we all know how these things work on a daily basis.</p>

<p>Tl;Dr DO NOT COMPLY WITH MUNDANE CONSPIRACY BECAUSE IT ALLOWS GREAT CONSPIRACY TO FLOURISH.</p>

<p>Anyhow. Whatever. Good night. Drink up. Smoke up. Whatever you like... just stop reacting and keep digging.</p>

<p>DIG DEEPER!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;For we are opposed around the world by a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy that relies primarily on covert means for expanding its sphere of influence--on infiltration instead of invasion, on subversion instead of elections, on intimidation instead of free choice, on guerrillas by night instead of armies by day. It is a system which has conscripted vast human and material resources into the building of a tightly knit, highly efficient machine that combines military, diplomatic, intelligence, economic, scientific and political operations.&quot;</p>

<p>I&#39;m so excited to eliminate that cancer from our (US) country.  God will lead justice to victory.  </p>

<p>I am so sick of hearing people say they don&#39;t exist or hearing people state that their victims are mentally ill.  They oppress and oppose those that did not oppose them and strengthen the hands of evil men.  The baby boomers watched their president get killed and heard him speak of their dangers, and now they have turned a blind eye or joined them.  I am running out of patience.</p>

<p>I won&#39;t warn you forever.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The last mundane conspiracy I uncovered at work (Big Telco) before I was terminated involved a presidential executive order (EO13618), the FCC, FBI, DHS and about 5 layers of corporate management to the EVP level. </p>

<p>It got me 2 years of retaliation at work  and they finally got me on an attendance technicality. I had 1 tardy in 6 months... career over.</p>

<p>Starting over aint so bad. More time to write a screen play about it and get it made into a movie.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Only slightly older than you and had largely the same experience. I watched all of the Iran-Contra hearings (when I wasn&#39;t in class) and discussed Oliver North as an übermensch with people and contrasting that with the constitution. I was fascinated with that. </p>

<p>Late in the afternoon of 9/11/01 when they announced that a Koran and a 757 flight manual had been recovered from Mohammad Atta&#39;s  rental car, I exclaimed to those around me, &quot;What is this? A Hardy Boys novel?&quot; I then had to explain who the Hardy Boys were.</p>

<p>There are many who have already dug deep enough, but can&#39;t convince a quorum of the rest of the planet – or have a plan – to do anything about it.</p>

<p>Thanks for this excellent angle on the problem and wish we could have a Scotch.</p>

<p>&quot;Bin Laden Determined to Attack the USA&quot;.. we knew that years before 911, since you know, he already tried multiple times before and succeeded with Cole. If it was really faked, why all the terrorists are from Saudi Arabia then? It took a lot of  PR cognitive manipulations to then blame Iraq </p>

<p>well that certainly explains why NASA&#39;s supposed science experiments that were conducted on the moon have never been properly replicated on the moon </p>

<p>GWB literally made a special request for info on OLB which was delivered to him in the August 6, 2001 PDB </p>

<p>because thats how false flags work. </p>

<p>we make it seem like someone else did it, usually someone that we already want to attack but don&#39;t yet have the moral justification do to so </p>

<blockquote>

<p>7 nations in 5 years, including Syria, which is still being attacked by the Pentagon and CIA to this very day </p>
