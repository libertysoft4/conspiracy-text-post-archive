    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. Militias and more rignt leaning people bought a shit ton of guns while Obama was in office. They didn&#39;t trust the government at all. Lulling those people into a false sense of security with a president who was &#39;on their side&#39; was the easiest way to continue down the path to NWO. </p>

<p>I do get why it&#39;s hard for them to see. In 2008, I was so excited about Obama, I believed he&#39;d close Guantanimo and tax the rich and work on our broken system. Instead we got drone strikes. And more wars than we know what to do with. They system is bigger than the president. They make you think &#39;your guy&#39; won so you&#39;ll shut up and sit down.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you misread me. I know that Obama was obstructed at every turn on every good thing he tried to do. I was trying to make a point about how disappointing it is when you think someone is in office who&#39;s actually going to make a difference and then it doesn&#39;t happen. Whether it doesn&#39;t happen because congress actively works against the president or because the president actually only gives a shit about his own ego, it&#39;s hard to go through when your hopes were up so high. If anyone looks at voting histories and is honest with themselves it&#39;s pretty clear that both sides aren&#39;t the same.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t say it was a big deal, I said people may want to read it. I also did not mention anything about flat Earth, it&#39;s obvious psy-op BS. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve been into conspiracies for quite a while. NWO/global government plots are something I&#39;ve been reading about since I was a little kid. After a while, you stop seeing new info (on this sub especially) and just see regurgitated BS. I&#39;ve read into pretty much every single outlandish theory I can find, just because I enjoy it. Hollow Earth fits with the tauridal field theory in a strange way, and that&#39;s why I find it more plausible than some other theories. I would have to see some real evidence before I actually believed it though. I&#39;ve also seen pictures of other planets that seem to show openings in the poles. But does that mean all the planets are hollow? No, it&#39;s just something to chew on. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure there is, but this sub used to host discussion about much of it as well. I mean it&#39;s a little bit different than sci-fi, fantasy, because it forces you to step back from your pre-concieved notion about the world for a moment. It&#39;s a healthy practice to shake up your perception of reality, as long as you don&#39;t get lost in the rabbit hole. </p>

I came here originally for non political conspiracy: Religious, extraterrestrial, esoteric/spiritual, cryptozoological, etc.  I don&#39;t enjoy having to sift through political hit pieces from both sides.  <em>OMG look what the Awans did now</em>  or <em>Trump had Russian business connections</em>  I could care less,  we all know politicians are guilty of a plethora of crimes.  Should be a rule no political discussion unless topic is X years old, nothing new or current imo.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t say it was a big deal, I said people may want to read it. I also did not mention anything about flat Earth, it&#39;s obvious psy-op BS. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve been into conspiracies for quite a while. NWO/global government plots are something I&#39;ve been reading about since I was a little kid. After a while, you stop seeing new info (on this sub especially) and just see regurgitated BS. I&#39;ve read into pretty much every single outlandish theory I can find, just because I enjoy it. Hollow Earth fits with the tauridal field theory in a strange way, and that&#39;s why I find it more plausible than some other theories. I would have to see some real evidence before I actually believed it though. I&#39;ve also seen pictures of other planets that seem to show openings in the poles. But does that mean all the planets are hollow? No, it&#39;s just something to chew on. </p>
