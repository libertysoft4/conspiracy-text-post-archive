    <div class="md"><p>capitalism is directly tied to the state,  it is a political system as are the rest of of usual -isms. hence we have &quot;crony&quot; capitalists, and &quot;we&quot; have &quot;licensing and franchises etc&quot; all with the goal and result of state granted monopolies, duopolies and oligarchies</p>

<p>what exists without the state is called &quot;the free market&quot;</p>

<p>what the u.s. has is a thinly veiled and increasing form of communism, all 10 planks in effect for many decades</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is a tigers jaw stronger than a gazelles&#39;? Capitalism does not need a State, it just is. Hierarchy in the animal kingdom, maybe? But, we are not animals, we are humans. I&#39;ve tricked far smarter people than myself. They had everything going for them, I was the under dog. I won. You cannot really see this in the world/animal kingdom, unless you are a gazelle running from a cheetah. You have ~20-30 seconds to out-trick them, before they over heat, and surrender.

    <div class="md"><p>You are talking about the parasitic nature of the state. The power of the state exists within all economic models, capitalism is no different. Free market voluntary transactions do not require the state. If I offer goods and services, for any method of payment then that is a voluntary transaction between two consenting parties. &quot;Capitalism&quot; can and will always exist without the state. People have always made mutually beneficial transactions since the dawn of existence. That&#39;s what capitalism is to me. Personally, capitalism has become a tainted word and basically a made up term by Marx. I prefer to use voluntary free market. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most people think Communism is an ideology dedicated to championing workers and the poor.  This was an incredibly successful ruse which manipulated millions. </p>

<p>Behind this artifice,  &quot;Communism&quot; is devoted to concentrating all wealth and power in the hands of the global central banking cartel (the Rothschilds and their allies) by disguising it as State power.  </p>

<p>The central banking cartel is the ultimate monopoly. It has an almost global monopoly over government credit. Its object is to translate this into a monopoly over everything - political, cultural, economic and spiritual.   One world government = Rothschild monopoly = Communism.</p>

<p>Any ideology that further concentrates wealth and power in the hands of the &quot;State&quot; is Communism in another guise. These ideologies -- socialism, liberalism, fascism, neo-conservatism, zionism and feminism -- are fronts for &quot;Communism,&quot; and are organized and funded by the central banking cartel.   Current events are all designed by the central bankers to increase government power. </p>

<p>The term has been so bastardized by marxist educators that i&#39;ve non-ironically heard &quot;State Capitalism&quot; as the reason for communist countries failing.</p>

<p>In capitalism, you only need to work hard enough to get what you want. If that is a simple life for your family, then farming is acceptable. </p>

<p>If that is a new Iphone every year, the latest kicks™, mountaindew and doritos, then you are placing the value of your work in the hands of someone else.</p>
