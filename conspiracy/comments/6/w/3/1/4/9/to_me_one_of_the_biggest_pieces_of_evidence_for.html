        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This is the most shocking moment in American history.  This is an attempted coup.  An attempt to oust a sitting democratically elected president.  </p>

<p>If he&#39;s innocent and he has no ties to Russia and its all a witch hunt, he doesnt seem worried.</p>

<p>We&#39;ve heard not one single story about him screaming at his staff or his family, or acting paranoid.  </p>

<p>That sort of pressure would drive someone insane.  If he&#39;s innocent.  Thinking everyones turning on him.  The FBI is investigating etc...</p>

<p>He doesnt seem worried AT ALL.  Not one single bit.  </p>

<p>The reason for this is of course is he knows.  He has known before even getting into office.  He would play dumb.  And then would clean house.  He knew the Dems would blame Russia and blame him.  He knew people would try to overthrow him.  He knew Mueller and Comey would act the way they did.  He knew because it was all orchestrated by him.  </p>

<p>He&#39;s as confident and cocky as he&#39;s always been.  </p>

<p>He talked to Mueller the night before.  Mueller told him that the investigation wasnt looking into Trump,  it was actually a cover and massive investigation into the DNC.  </p>

<p>Trump and his staff leak stories to the press about the FBI and Russia and all that in order to smokescreen it all.  To throw the DNC off the track.  To throw the press off the track.  All the while Comey and Mueller and everyone else is investigating the DNC.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Donald Trump has borrowed billions of dollars from high power financial institutions; including Wall Street. We don&#39;t know how much debt he has hanging around his neck. He has eight ex-Goldman Sachs executives serving as his advisers. Is that by coincidence? Do you think that the same powers that control the world&#39;s leaders would let the fate of the world rest in Donald&#39;s hands; allowing him to do whatever he pleases? If you think so, name the last president America had that was not a puppet of some puppet-masters. The last one I can think of was Kennedy, and that was because he was under the thumb of his father Joe. When JFK told his dad he wasn&#39;t going to obey his orders anymore, JFK was independent of any puppet-masters, but shortly afterwards he was murdered.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not saying this is necessarily the case w/Trump, but there are some people that aren&#39;t the least bit phased by what the world thinks about them so long as they know what their truth is.  I&#39;m not saying <em>I&#39;m</em> necessarily one of those people either, but I know that if I didn&#39;t do &quot;XYZ&quot;, then I don&#39;t care <em>who</em> thinks I did.  Doesn&#39;t matter if the whole world&#39;s against me.  Doesn&#39;t matter if I go down in flames hated by everyone.  I still wouldn&#39;t say or think or feel I did &quot;XYZ&quot; if I didn&#39;t.</p>

<p>My point here is simply that maybe - just maybe - there&#39;s a possibility that Trump might not be all that flustered by the Russia bullshit simply because he knows it&#39;s bullshit.</p>

<p>Doesn&#39;t take that much to not get flustered by lies if they&#39;re lies.</p>

<p>At least that&#39;s how some people are, and I can relate to that.</p>

<p>So what am I trying to say here?</p>

<p>I guess nothing really.  I&#39;m not saying Trump is shit or is awesome.  Maybe he <em>is</em> playing 4D chess, but I don&#39;t think his not flipping out is in and of itself the only (or even major) indicator of that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not being flustered by what the world thinks of you and being the most powerful man in the world and in the middle of a coup to oust you from the presidency is two very different things.  </p>

<p>He isn&#39;t ranting and raving to his kids and staff about the FBI or Mcmaster.  He hasn&#39;t descended into paranoia.  </p>

<p>And thats because as you say, he knows the Russian Narrative is bullshit.  </p>

<p>He doesnt seem bothered by it all, and most interestingly doesnt seem bothered that he will end up ousted or in prison.  </p>

<p>Why is that?  </p>

<p>Mueller is on our side.  Trump knew all this from day 1.  He knew it.  And its all been a slow slow slow burn of a revelation to us all.  But he knew it</p>

<p>Of course.  But so what?  Again, and as I said, there are some people that don’t have a problem with being accused of something if they know they didn’t actually <em>do</em> it.</p>
