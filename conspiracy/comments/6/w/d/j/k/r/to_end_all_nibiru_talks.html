        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The idea of a planet that comes every 3600 years beyond our solar system was originated from a guy, named Zacharia Sitchen. He has never disclosed any credentials or degrees on knowing Sumerian. In other words, people trusted him on blind faith alone. </p>

<p>Now back when he was claiming these things, there were no other authorities on translating the Sumerian tablets. Since then, we have discovered a dictionary (another Sumerian tablet) that translates from Sumerian to Arcadian. Based off of this dictionary, we have came to light that Sitchen was very inaccurate in his interpretations. We have also learned that there were no mentions of Nibiru or idea of Gods being extraterrestrial for that matter. </p>

<p>A lot of the ancient astronaut theorists revolve their work around Sitchen. Even David Icke bases a lot of his work off of Sitchen. At this point I feel confident in suggesting these guys can be written off. Any doomsday prophecy regarding another planet can also be safely thrown out the window.  </p>

<p>I recommend you guys all do your own research and help spread the word that there is no such thing as Nibiru in this subreddit and other places. Even sensationalists like David Icke or others who share Sitchen&#39;s views are very questionable. </p>

<p>Some resources to get you all started:</p>

<p>Edit: I wanted to throw it out there that I do believe in other beings, dimensional and extraterrestrial. But unfortunately I think there is a lot of disinformation in these kind of topics, thanks to guys like Sitchen. </p>

<p>False. Nibru-ki is mentioned plenty of times. &quot;Experts&quot; officially translate it as a shrine, yet it is spoken contextually as a place or realm of the gods, where men of renown or Kings have come and gone from.</p>

<p>The &quot;expert&quot; translations are not 100% accurate. Neither were Stichens. He really mucked some things up but he was also on to something.</p>

<p>There is a very liberal use of interpretation in many of the records, &quot;officially.&quot; </p>

<p>To show that even in academic circles Nibiru is referred to as a planet in some cases.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>but base meanings usually hold.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not really. For instance in Hebrew <em>Satan</em> is simply &quot;adversary&quot;. Yet in English translations it gets translated as a identified being.</p>

<p>Sin, is also &quot;to miss the mark&quot;. Yet it was translated into something entirely different. </p>

<p>Probably the best example of something being skewed for political or religious agenda. </p>

<hr/>

<p>Another interesting translation for biblical texts is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftsN8v8h7v4">Mauro Biglino&#39;s literal translations</a>. Though he may exist in some agenda, he worked for Vatican publisher until he began releasing his books.</p>

<p>His literal translations suggest Elohim is plural. That &#39;ruach&#39; or the breadth of Elohim, were a physical manifestation. That &quot;an image of god&quot; implied DNA engineering. That the actual verb for creation was never used in biblical text, but instead taking over something that pre-existed. Etc so on and so forth.</p>

<p>Literal translations are always interesting because they remove added in interpretations and &#39;explanations&#39; which are incredibly subjective.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You should understand the context of things before blabber stuff out. As for the word &#39;sin,&#39; it means miss the mark as in missing the standard of perfection established by God. As far as I am concerned, the way we interpret sin today is essentially the same in a holistic way. As for Satan, there is no one-in-all agreement as to what it means today in English. But I think most would agree that it is a title for someone who opposes God as an adversary. See? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Have a little sympathy for Sitchen.  When he did his work, he was the first.  The Sumerians had previously been a myth, someone we had no confirmation of.  Then we got confirmation, and it was &quot;impossible to translate&quot; but Sitchen dove in anyway.</p>

<p>You&#39;re unreasonable if you expect perfection in that capacity.  And that being said, Sitchen&#39;s detractors have had decades to prove him &quot;completely wrong&quot; and not everything he produced was incorrect.  Yes he made some mistakes, but that&#39;s part of academia.  </p>

<p>I doubt you&#39;ve read Sitchen&#39;s work in enough detail to really comprehend it, but getting say 50% of the material correct is amazing in any new field, be it science or archaeology or anything.  </p>

<p>Furthermore, even if you take away 100% of sitchen&#39;s translations, there are still things about Sumerian culture that do not add up unless you adopt part of Sitchen&#39;s views.  No matter what &quot;current experts&quot; in a dead language claim, Sitchen&#39;s hypothesis does an unparalleled job of explaining Sumerian origins and culture in a way that no modern researcher has yet matched.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That actual historical Sumerian records and Sumerian &quot;stories&quot; line up exactly with what Sitchen&#39;s says. </p>

<p>Wikipedia:</p>

<p>Pantheon
The majority of Sumerian deities belonged to a classification called the Anunna (“[offspring] of An”), whereas seven deities, including Enlil and Inanna, belonged to a group of “underworld judges&quot; known as the Anunnaki (“[offspring] of An” + Ki). During the Third Dynasty of Ur, the Sumerian pantheon was said to include sixty times sixty (3600) deities.[7]:182</p>

<p>Primeval deities
Nammu was the primeval sea (Engur), who gave birth to An (heaven) and Ki (earth) and the first deities; she eventually became known as the goddess Tiamat. An was the ancient Sumerian god of the heavens. He was the ancestor of all the other major deities[11] and the original patron deity of Uruk.</p>

<p>Enlil and his family
Enlil was the god of air, wind, and storm.[12]:108 He was the patron deity of the city of Nippur.[13]:58 Ninlil was an air goddess and Enlil&#39;s primary consort. She was one of the matron deities of Nippur; she was believed to reside in the same temple as Enlil.[14] Ninurta was the son of Enlil and Ninlil. He was worshipped as the god of war, agriculture, and one of the Sumerian wind gods. He was the patron deity of Girsu and one of the patron deities of Lagash.</p>

<p>Enki and Ninhursag
Enki was god of freshwater, male fertility, and knowledge.[15]:75 His most important cult center was the E-abzu temple in the city of Eridu.[15]:75 He was the patron and creator of humanity[15]:75 and the sponsor of human culture.[15]:75 His primary consort was Ninhursag, the Sumerian goddess of the earth.[15]:140 Ninhursag was worshipped in the cities of Kesh and Adab.[15]:140</p>

<p>Inanna
Ancient Akkadian cylinder seal depicting Inanna resting her foot on the back of a lion while Ninshubur stands in front of her paying obeisance, c. 2334-2154 BC.[16]:92, 193
Inanna was the Sumerian goddess of love, sexuality, prostitution, and war.[15]:109 She was the divine personification of the planet Venus, the morning and evening star.[15]:108-109 Her main cult center was the Eanna temple in Uruk, which had been originally dedicated to An. Deified kings may have re-enacted the marriage of Inanna and Dumuzi with priestesses.[15]:151, 157-158 Accounts of her parentage vary;[15]:108 in most myths, she is usually presented as the daughter of Nanna and Ningal,[16]:ix-xi, xvi but, in other stories, she is the daughter of Enki or An along with an unknown mother.[15]:108 The Sumerians had more myths about her than any other deity.[16]:xiii, xv[17]:101 Many of the myths involving her revolve around her attempts to usurp control of the other deities&#39; domains.[18]</p>

<p>Ereshkigal
Main article: Ereshkigal
Ereshkigal was the goddess of the Sumerian Underworld, which was known as Kur. She was Inanna&#39;s older sister.[19]</p>

<p>Celestial deities
Utu was god of the sun, whose primary center of worship was the E-babbar temple[20] in Sippar. Nanna was god of the moon and of wisdom. He was the father of Utu and one of the patron deities of Ur.[21] He may have also been the father of Inanna and Ereshkigal. Ningal was the wife of Nanna,[22] as well as the mother of Utu, Inanna, and Ereshkigal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s some &#39;official&#39; lines on Nibiru via the resource you provided:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Let the magilum boats of Meluḫa <strong>transport gold and silver and bring them to Nibru</strong> for Enlil, king of all the lands.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2></h2>

<blockquote>
<p>He brought their silver and lapis-lazuli, their treasure, to Enlil, king of all the lands, <strong>in Nibru</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<h2></h2>

<blockquote>
<p>There was a city, there was a city -- the one we live in. <strong>Nibru was the city</strong>, the one we live in.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2></h2>

<blockquote>
<p>She abandoned the Barag-dur-ĝara <strong>in Nibru</strong>, and descended to the underworld.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2></h2>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Its food offerings could not be taken to Enlil in Nibru. Its watercourse was empty, barges could not travel</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s interesting to note what the &quot;underworld&quot; is defined as. Since for heavenly beings their underworld would be Earth. And Earth&#39;s would be yet another. If you apply this to ancient myth it opens up a whole different context of interpretation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well you see, since you are a complete moron, I will try to break it down.  They haven&#39;t found the planet that perturbs the orbits of planets like Neptune And beyond, but they know something is out there causing it.  The most likely case is a large planet.  In this article a planet that has been found with a elongated orbit of 1,100 years to highlight the fact that such orbits are possible.  Based on science It is likely that a large planet with an elongated orbit is effecting our solar system. I know you just want to disprove stitchen which is fine, but scientist discovered this before he even started his research.   Hopefully your not a complete idiot and you understand that scientists have been studying this for nearly a century </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nibiru is one name. The vatican calls it wormwood which is in the bible. They have an observatory on Mount Graham in Arizona looking for exoplanets, and I think they are watching it based on what I&#39;ve heard. All major governments know about this, but it&#39;s highly classified. The navy is expecting to lose all their ports when this comes around due to the rising ocean levels as the poles shift. It&#39;s why the CIA moved to Colorado, and the new capital of the US will be Denver for continuity of government.</p>

<p>If you really want to hear the truth about it, you need to watch John Moore with military intelligence connections. This was from a conference a few months ago.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t need to watch a full hour-long video where they repeatedly say it isn&#39;t confirmed to know that it hasn&#39;t been confirmed ... keep trying to spread info which is directly contradicted by what you linked, it&#39;s hilarious.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t disclosure, it&#39;s you making assumptions and then spreading falsehoods.  The paper on the subject still literally says &quot;could&quot; and you&#39;re acting as if NASA confirmed the existence of Nibiru ... </p>

<p>How can you make that statement after your first statement?</p>

<p>Because through other research you see that NASA has never stated that they are certain there is another planet.  There&#39;s other sources of information than Youtube videos you know?</p>

<p>If my statement is incorrect, then direct me to the point in the video where NASA claims that they are certain there is another planet.</p>

<p>You can&#39;t, and won&#39;t, because they don&#39;t.  You&#39;re spreading falsehoods, period.</p>
