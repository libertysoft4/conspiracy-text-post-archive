    <div class="md"><p>I know you want to believe that. I did too. But tit didn&#39;t happen. Not anywhere close to how we&#39;ve been taught it did. </p>

<p>Was it war? Yeah. Did People die? Oh yes. Was it tragic? Yeah. Was it fair? No. We&#39;re there some executions?Probably so. Was there disease and starvation. Yeah. </p>

<p>We&#39;re there gas chambers? No. Did 6 million Jews die? No. We&#39;re people thrown alive into ovens? No. </p>

<p>We&#39;ve been lied to about so many details about this story, that the entire thing is cast into suspicion.  No one wants to believe that humans are evil enough to do aHolocaust . But also no one wants to believe that anyone would lie about such a thing. </p>

<p>You have a lit more research ahead of you. Reading that doesn&#39;t include mainstream sources. You&#39;ll have to go off-road here. Start with david cole Auschwitz tour, Robert faurrison lectures. See how you feel after that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m intrigued and will definitely end up watching the doc you listed. But just out of curiosity, my wife and I were visiting Munich last year and we stopped at Dachau to see the camp there, and we saw their gas chambers. What&#39;s the general consensus on that? </p>

<p>Is the theory that they were built after the war or never used or what?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Without breaking down each camp or &quot;chamber&quot; it goes something like this:</p>

<p>Zyklon B gas was invented by a German pest control agency. In those days love carried typhus disease and it would spread quickly in unclean populations. The US even used zyklon B at Ellis island when we took in massive immigrants in the early 1900&#39;s. </p>

<p>Immigrants at Ellis were treated in quite similar manner as &quot;concentration camp&quot;prisoners . Hair cuts, showers, and clothes were them into huge rooms and gassed. There are indeed rooms at the camps that were used to fumigate clothing. </p>

<p>At Ellis island the chambers were more professional. Big steal air tight chambers. Not these impromptu ad libbed chambers the Germans built. </p>

<p>Jewish stories of &quot;being led into showers&quot; are indeed true. But water came out. Today&#39;s best engineers will day that pumping zyklon B out of &quot;fake shower heads&quot; doesn&#39;t work, wouldn&#39;t kill, and those stories are just wartime myth/propaganda. </p>

<p>The rate at which bodies could be cremated eons slower than the rates claimed by Holocaust supporters. Cremation of dead bodies did indeed happen. But they died from starvation or disease. There is no such thing as &quot;open ovens&quot; or &quot;open air cremation&quot;. It can&#39;t be done. You need a closed space, shitload of fuel, and about an hour and a half per body. </p>

<p>In the 1.25 years the &quot;has chambers were alleged to have been operating, nowhere near 6 million bodies could have been properly cremated. </p>

<p>And there aren&#39;t jack shit for mass graves. Except the ones created by the allies when the camps were liberated. All footage of dead bodies is from war department footage of clean up operaikns at the camp. Germany was bombed to shit and supplies could not flow. So a lot of people died in the camps near the end. </p>

<p>No mass gassings. No &quot;Holocaust&quot;. Just Jewish and soviet propaganda. And a multi billion dollar Industry. </p>

<p>There&#39;s so much more to it. That&#39;s thebare bones . </p>

    <div class="md"><p>And while I have zero way to know if that&#39;s a true story or not, I&#39;ll simply say I doubt it. No offense. The thing is, you don&#39;t really know if it&#39;s true either. Your grandmother could have been lied to herself, or she could simply be following the lead of so many other other jews who&#39;ve told these stories. I can show you a bunch of vids right now of &quot;survivors&quot; 100% lying and making shit up. On camera. Changing their stories over the years etc. </p>

<p>There are wild stories of &quot;Germans throwing babies into the air and shooting at them for target practice&quot;. Lies. &quot;Germans each holding an arm and leg of a Jewish baby and tearing them off at the same time&quot;. Horseshit. </p>

<p>All the soap and lampshades stories are lies as well, and rejected by even the most extreme researchers and historians. Stories of jews hiding diamond in their rectums for many years. All lies for attention, sympathy, or the betterment of the &quot;Holocaust narrative&quot;. All garbage. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll stop with this: in war, do shitty things happen? Yes. Could there even be isolated stories of a bit of brutality, or lack of respect for human dignity? Absolutely. Just look at those US Marines that threw that puppy off the cliff during Afghanistan war years ago. Or the US abuse of muslim prisoners at Guantanamo. It happens. </p>

<p>But do you really think that an alleged maniacal serial killer, (Hitler) could turn every single one of his followers into maniacal serial killers too? Tearing apart babies, throwing them in the air etc? </p>

<p>As I said, I highly doubt it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was brought up in a straightforward family. If there is no reason to lie, you don&#39;t. So, yeah, she&#39;s not a lying jew. Nazis were terrible people who bought into propaganda, just like our shitty society today. If they were not burned, they were shot and my then teenage grandmother was told they were burned as a jest. Which is just as bad.</p>

<p>If the powers that be can create an america absolutely swathed by morons who believe there should be a race war, etc, they could have easily done the same back then.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude nobody is saying anything about them tearing babies apart. But are you really gonna sit here and say hitler wasn&#39;t a mad man? No he 100% was. Once again I only don&#39;t believe the numbers of Jews that died. But hitler and his friends were sick twisted fucks and they did indeed rip people out of their homes and throw them in slave camps. And people did in fact die In these camps weather the nazis killed them or they died from disease. Also a little bold just to call her a liar cuz you believe this conspiracy.

    <div class="md"><p>While I agree with you on most of those points, please refer to my other posts ITT. I never denied that people died. Especially if disease and starvation. I&#39;ve said exactly that ITT. That&#39;s exactly where we get ANY footage of bodies. The dead starved, the dead diseased. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s both agree that Hitler wasnt some saint.  I suggest to anyone here to read the history of the Jews in europe. Start around the 1600&#39;s. </p>

<p>In the 1800&#39;s Germany was the FIRST and ONLY country in Europe to grant full citizenship and rights to Jews. They also removed any quotas on immigration and allowed jews to hold public office etc. Even Britain didn&#39;t do such. </p>

<p>It was when the Jewish elite bankers came in and took over Germany financially, that the Germans started getting upset that their country was being destroyed. Just like we are upset that our country is being destroyed by the descendents of that very same group of people in 2017. And have been in their clutches for quite some time. So in the German mind, there was reason to remove jews from the &quot;fatherland&quot;. They just wanted them gone. Not exterminated off the planet. </p>

<p>Hitler even made a huge immigration deal WITH Zionist leaders to help jews migrate into Palestine PRE WAR. </p>

<p>If those facts elude people ITT I suggest you start reading. It&#39;s the only way to know. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A lot of people who question the Holocaust focus specifically on the number that died (often arguing the real number is lower than the &quot;accepted&quot; number) and whether or not the concentration/slave camps were actual death camps or not with gas chambers/ovens/etc. (most argue that there were no gas chambers or ovens at the camps, or if there were they were used for things other than murdering jews).</p>

<p>General/President Dwight Eisenhower discusses this in his 1963 memoir, The White House Years: Mandate for Change, 1953-1956 (pp. 312-313). When he was informed in mid-July 1945 by Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson of the decision to use the atomic bomb, he was deeply troubled:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>During his [Stimson’s] recitation of the relevant facts, I had been conscious of a feeling of depression and so I voiced to him my grave misgivings, first on the basis of my belief that Japan was already defeated and that dropping the bomb was completely unnecessary, and secondly because I thought that our country should avoid shocking world opinion by the use of a weapon whose employment was, I thought, no longer mandatory as a measure to save American lives. It was my belief that Japan was, at that very moment, seeking some way to surrender with a minimum loss of “face.”</p>

<p>WHAT THE FUCK WAS THE POINT???!!</p>

<p>It meanders all over the place, points out a shit load of dots BUT DIDN&#39;T CONNECT THEM!</p>

<p>It has some decent points, some interesting historical info, it name drops hypernormalization but then doesnt give us the point. </p>

<p>Is the point to say &quot;we are normalized to the abnormal&quot;? Because DUH!</p>

<p>You know what really becomes obvious about Halfway through?   That he&#39;s dancing around, toying with the real issue but avoiding it. </p>

<p>Zionist Jew families and bankers fucking up the world and making it seem like anyone elses fault but theirs. In fact, it almost seems as if this doc is specifically serving that exact purpose. Point the finger elsewhere. Sure it brings up banking and finance, but just to quickly mention it. Never does it blame it. We all know they are to blame. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Haha. Every single person in the world has a world view bro. The reason we are here on this sub is to enhance or to update that view right? Guess what, my original worldview did not include those types of thoughts. In fact my original &quot;predetermined&quot; included a hefty dude if religious brainwashing from my gullible parents who joined a cult. This part of my world view was learned. </p>

<p>When I updated that part of my world view would you call that &quot;predetermined&quot;?
I don&#39;t think you know what predetermined means. </p>

<p>Sounds like your predetermined worldview includes a strong lack of awareness on the Rothschild&#39;s, fractional reserve banking, the federal reserve act, income tax, ties between the most rich and powerful American families with the most rich and powerful old Jewish European families, bolshevism, communism, khazars vs semitic Jews, and the establishment of israel (Zion) in the heart of a dessert that had belonged to an opposing religious group for nearly a couple thousand years before the American and Brits helped the Jews steal it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not really, but I will try. It doesn&#39;t suggest Hitler was a good guy, it suggest he was a &quot;Germany first&quot; guy, which in today&#39;s globalist worldview translates to &#39;bad guy&#39;. It gives a context to why WWII actually began, and shows how much German people suffered under 
control of the bankers and media manipulators who were, as history shows all Jewish.
I think this is a useful doc. to watch simply because there is such a divide nowadays between the &#39;right&#39; and the &#39;left&#39;, and since the left&#39;s  narrative is dominant in MSM, it&#39;s  only natural to see what the other side has to say. </p>

<p>Of course, not suggesting anyone should watch it in one sitting, but when in mood, I think there is a lot to learn from this doc.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like Greer a lot but I had mixed reactions toward this doc. I felt ripped off, actually. A great deal of what&#39;s in it has been out there for a long time &amp; was in Sirius. It&#39;s basically a repackaging of familiar content if you&#39;re a UFO/EBE enthusiast. Only about 25% of it was new to me. I paid about $15 for a digital copy then it popped up on Netflix :/  </p>

<p>It&#39;s definitely <em>good</em>. The material is extremely compelling, even in my revisit. I would highly recommend it to someone who hasn&#39;t done a ton of research into this subject or someone who wants to re-familiarize themselves with some of the best evidence of extraterrestrial contact. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In light the 20 year anniversary of Princess Diana&#39;s death in two days, I would think <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jFkkRF-nXg">Unlawful Killing: The Murder of Princess Diana</a> would be appropriate.</p>

<p>It shows the complete blueprint for everything we&#39;ve become so cynically used to. An unassuming, deeply loving and good person finds its way to power and dares to start using it for good purposes. MLK, JFK, John Lennon, you know the rest. No case shows it all so clearly as Diana&#39;s death did. </p>

<p>Everything is on display, from the events leading up to it, over the immediate events surrounding the fatal car crash and completely botched emergency response, to the careless cover-up (They immediately claimed the driver was an alcoholic, even though he passed his pilots license three days before the event and has a receipt from the hotel over no more than 2 small drinks).</p>

<p>Precisely how and why it all happened should be ripe questions for a fruitful debate still very relevant today, 20 years after the fact. I really hope you&#39;ll consider it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Take your pick, there are dozens. The one that made it into the tabloids was her affair with movie producer Dodi Al-Fayed, whom she loved very dearly. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mwx4jT9ld4">Her marriage to Charles was notoriously awkward and love-less.</a></p>

<p>I don&#39;t think that alone was the reason though. She did write a letter to her butler just a few months before the &quot;accident&quot;, in which she explained that she thought that they&#39;d try to get rid of her in a car crash. Whether she was tipped off by an insider or just had a dream about it is unknown, <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1573170/Princess-Diana-letter-Charles-plans-to-kill-me.html">but it&#39;s an eery letter regardless.</a></p>

<p>She spoke many times about how she felt totally at odds with the rest of the royal tradition, being that all she wanted to be is someone who loves the people and works for the people, while the Windsors thought her to be a non-starter. They made a mistake of bringing someone into the fold who still had a soul.</p>

<p>Another aspect which might seem outlandish to some because it&#39;s not being talked about much is that she became aware of the plans for the new millenium, beginning with 9/11.</p>

<p>The above is a mixed bag of fact, inference, and speculation, so take it all with a bag of salt. At the end of the day, though, motivations are nearly impossible to prove. The facts of the cover-up, as well as all the events leading up to it, do strongly suggest that the plot came straight from Buckingham Palace.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miD_mtAEdRs">The Money Masters</a> is a 3 and a half hour long documentary that I would consider to be required viewing for anyone who considers themselves a conspiracy theorist. </p>

<p>It is a bare bones documentary, very low budget, but high information that was made by historian Bill Still. </p>

<p>If you are looking for a slickly produced documentary this is not it. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a very dense documentary with a lot of information about the House of Rothschild in particular that is difficult to find in other places.</p>

<p>After watching the Money Masters, you will look at history, particularly American history very differently. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There has been a lot of discussion on how and why pedophilia is becoming normalized. </p>

<p>If you want to know how/why pedophilia and NAMBLA began to be normalized, you have to go back to Alfred Kinsey, the &quot;father of the sexual revolution&quot;, creator of &quot;The Kinsey Institute&quot;, the first academic to bring the study of human sexuality into the mainstream. How progressive, right?</p>

<p>But, what most people do not know is that Alfred Kinsey actually paid pedophiles to collect data on how long it took infants, todllers and children to orgasm. The data is actually listed in his book - it has its own data table.</p>

<p>Kinsey was highly influential in academia, normalizing sexual deviance as a natural variation in human sexuality,  and his work went on to influece laws regarding sexuality. The documentary walks you through how his influence is largely responsible for the lenient sentencing guidelines for convicted pedophiles.</p>

<p>Fair warning - learning about that stuff screwed with my world view. You will literally never look at the world in the same way again. It&#39;s not graphic, but I suggest you be in a good space mentally before viewing.</p>

<p>The documentary has Christian propaganda in the beginning, but just skip throught it if it offends you. The rest of the documentary and the research is solid. In fact, I found it so unbelievable, I had to verify it for myself. Unbelievable, but seemingly historically accurate. And damn disturbing. </p>

<p>Rest in peace Joshua Paniagua, the narrator of that documentary.. he passed away a few months after it was made at the age of 24. We made it arduously long, it&#39;s 3 hours but I think it&#39;s pretty thorough and approaches topics no other documentaries or research have approached very much, like the academic institutions and pharma corporations at the beginning of the 20th century and their ties to eugenics</p>
