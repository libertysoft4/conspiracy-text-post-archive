    <div class="md"><p>Like I said, compartmentalization. People only needed to know, <em>what they needed to know</em>. Nothing more, nothing less. For example: A man tooling a piece that would later end up in the actual nuclear device did not need to know what it was going into, only that it was his job to tool x piece <em>for something</em>.</p>

<p>Same thing with Paperclip. A man charged with bringing x person into the country, did not need to know that the person they were bringing in was a high ranking Nazi scientist, just that the person was important to the mission that they were given. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Einstein was given bogus intelligence reports that stated that the Germans were in the process of building a nuclear bomb in order to enlist his help on the Manhattan Project. </p>

<p>He was also told that the bomb they wanted him to help design and build would only be used to deter the Germans from attempting to use one of their own against the Allies. </p>

<p>Of course the Germans had no atomic bomb building program and the US had every intention of using the bomb on either the Germans or the Japanese just as soon as they had it. </p>

<p>By the time the bomb was ready Germany had already been defeated and in all truth, so had the Japanese but Truman decided to use it on them anyways, not to force Japan&#39;s inevitable and impending surrender, but as a display of force to intimidate the Soviets.</p>

<p>Worse yet, Truman selected two targets that all the Allies had previously agreed to avoid just as much as possible not only because Hiroshima and Nagasaki had no military value, but were the two main centers of Christianity in Japan. In fact even the mayor of Hiroshima at that time was known to be a Christian. Of all of the people in Japan, they were the most innocent and least deserving of the horrific fate that was both deliberately and unnecessarily visited upon them.</p>

<p>Einstein never forgave himself or the US government for that and made a serious effort to promote peace and diplomacy from that point up until the end of his life.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Albert Einstein didn&#39;t design the atomic bomb or work on the Manhattan Project. His contribution to the project was a signature on a letter to the President of the United States stating that it was possible to make an atomic bomb and that German chemists had made a breakthrough that could potentially lead them to developing this devastating explosive device. There were in fact German scientists that had made a breakthrough that could eventually lead to atomic bombs; whether they could see the application and complete the process to weaponize it was another matter.</p>

<p>Whether he was misled into signing the document or not, he did not contribute to the Manhattan Project outside of previously completed research that dealt with explaining atomic forces as thermal energy. In fact, according to the American Museum of Natural History, Albert Einstein indeed tried to work on the project but was deemed a security risk and was thus forbidden from working on the project or consulting with those who did. </p>

Leeping people quiet is easy nowadays, you can either kill them outright or use their careers as leverage against them to ensure their obedience.

    <div class="md"><p>Compartmentalization. You don&#39;t need everyone knowing the full plan, or even that they are participating in any sort of plan. One group creates a small piece, and they think it will be utilized in one way, then those at the top of the conspiracy are able to redirect the finished part of the project to where they deem fit. Gate-keeping plays a large role as well. You don&#39;t need to co-opt an entire organization, only its leadership or strategically positioned gatekeepers to stifle questions from the lower ranks and outsiders. Finally- blackmail, whether its sexual or otherwise, is a highly effective tool for keeping people quiet, especially if it involves depravities as deep as pizza/pedogate. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>People do come out, and speak about them all the time.  There are &quot;whistleblowers&quot; on all sorts of different topics.  The problem becomes, that these whistleblowers are attacked, discredited, killed, or accused with trumped up charges to remove them from the public scene.</p>

<p>It&#39;s hard to gauge the credibility of individual whistleblowers because there are real frauds out there, mixed in with genuine speakers, who are then character assassinated in the media.  Their credentials are sullied, their motives are attacked, their moral character, all of it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. My additional input is that there seems to be complex psychological factors that occur a) in the presence of groups and b) in the presence of trusted authority figures. A leader you believe in or even your own family can cause you to seriously question your version of the truth, no matter how vivid. </p>

<p>There have times listening to some people I admire talk about 9/11 for example and I find myself thinking, you know, they&#39;re right, someone did do that stuff, our leaders are looking out for best interest... I imagine a real whistleblower would experience something akin to Captain John (?) trying to bring Rambo home. </p>

<p>Anyway, if they are strong enough to overcome the psychological aspects, there are a whole host of other ways like the ones you pointed out to quash the story. </p>

<p>There were photos of Area 51 for a long time before it was officially acknowledged. Not until 1989 when Lazar came out did it all blow up and was finally admitted by Obama is memory serves? So everyone that had ever worked there had been quiet for 45 years.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not everyone involved in, say, 9/11 knew all the details of the whole operation, just what they were tasked with.</p>

<p>Also, again with the 9/11 example, it wasn&#39;t <em>&#39;the (whole) govenment&#39;</em> that did it. It was many sides, factions, many teams, <em>many countries&#39;</em> agents involved. All with agendas y their own interests on not spilling any beans.</p>

<p>Also, I find it sad to hear the <em>someone should have talked!</em> argument repeated over and over again. Maybe these people never had to keep a secret. Either personal, family-related, or involving your job or occupation, most adults at one point in life have to keep something hidden due repercussions to many around them, and often in industry it&#39;s common to sign NDAs and the like meant to keep info secret. And the penalties for breaching this can go from legal, to criminal, to tragedies.</p>

<p>Imagine being froced to keep secrets involving major criminal conspiracies. Seeing first hand that innocent victims and collateral damage are <em>acceptable</em> to those initiating them. Knowing the level of penalty for any leak due a crisis of conscience will be and maybe reach anyone you know and love.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The counter argument is that it&#39;s illogical. Saying grand conspiracies can&#39;t exist without whistleblowers doesn&#39;t make sense. Some conspiracies come to light thanks to dogged journalists, others due to the activities of law enforcement, and still others undoubtedly never come to light at all. The absence of a whistleblower means nothing.</p>

<p>Others have mentioned the Manhattan Project, but there are more recent and mundane examples of conspiracies that involved lots of people and zero whistleblowers: the Libor scandal, the metal price fixing scandal, the Forex fixing scandal, the Volkswagen emissions scandal, the HSBC money laundering scandal, Enron... Basically when your fortune or freedom is based on a lie, then it&#39;s in your interest to maintain that lie. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a pretty poor argument for anyone who knows anything about hierarchy in power structures.</p>

<p>The military is a good example.  Soldiers can be on the ground killing for their country and have no idea the grand designs of the generals.  This happens regularly in the military, as well as many other walks of life.</p>

<p>Also, the threat of torture to an individual and their family is a very powerful tool to silence the few that may know too much.  I wouldn&#39;t last long in a torture chamber before I was willing to comply.  Most people probably wouldn&#39;t be able to take ten minutes of torture without giving in.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All the big conspiracy theories have many leaks the thing is nobody believes what the leakers have to say. All you have to do is convince the people that the leakers are tinfoil hat wearing nuts and the leak is contained.</p>

<p>Add to that the slow leak of info into the science fiction community so that when somebody tells you they saw a ufo or whatnot the average person will think they are crazy because everyone knows that its just science fiction and not real.</p>

    <div class="md"><ul>
<li><p>The first point people usually make is that somebody would have talked by now. “If you had thousands of people involved in a major conspiracy like 9/11, somebody would have come forward. No way they could keep it secret.” My first response to this is: imagine somebody threatened to kill you and your family if you spoke out and you thought they were serious. What are the chances that you would say something? Zero, right? So why is it inevitable that somebody would speak out?</p></li>
<li><p>“But,” comes the reply, “what about somebody who is near death or doesn’t have any family. They might have the courage to speak out, right?” OK, let’s say for the sake of argument that somebody does speak out, where would that person turn to? The media is controlled, they will never cover any real whistle-blowers. You’ll never hear from them. Even Facebook and Twitter censor objectionable posts and tweets. And anybody who managed somehow to get their message out would be immediately silenced and discredited or the story surrounded with a flurry of counterclaims and misdirection.</p></li>
<li><p>But the very idea that somebody would ‘speak out’ implies that the people involved in these projects are people of good conscience who are doing something they know to be wrong against their will or later decide what they did was wrong. Why should we assume that anybody involved would want to speak out in the first place?
It’s also possible that the majority of people involved in the conspiracy might be people of good conscience who believe they are doing it for a good cause. Soldiers involved in the Gulf of Tonkin hoax, for example, probably believed (and still do) that they were doing it to win the fight against communism. Same with 9/11 and terrorism. Yes, the American people had to be lied to, but it was for their own good. For anybody who believes that, speaking out would be an act of treason. Why would these patriotic Americans willingly commit treason? Especially to reveal a secret about something they think was good?</p></li>
