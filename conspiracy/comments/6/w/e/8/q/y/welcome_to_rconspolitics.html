<p>Like it or not conspiracies usually involve a government somewhere and how is a government fueled? Politics. </p>

<p>Avoiding politics is literally avoiding the conspiracies about why the nature of the politic and how it may affect you and others.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, but you haven&#39;t shown how the deep state has fought DJT. </p>

<p>The checks and balances in our government were created so that any one branch of our government could not have too much power. So that if <em>any</em> branch overstepped their boundary ( bypassing another branch to get their desired way), the other branches may come together and stop such action. </p>

For example, the Executive Branch can veto bills from the Legislative Branch, but the Legislative Branch can override the veto.&quot;</a> from congress for kids. The other articles say that it&#39;s to limit the three branches of government, so that they may always be equal in terms of their power in the government. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The reason I made this post, Is that I saw three regular conspiracy posters called &quot;nazi sympathizers&quot; for questioning the events in Charlottesville.</p>

<p>Nazi, and Nazi sympathizer are the new deep state buzzword for creating devision.  They present this issue a massive race war, when it&#39;s really just a very, very, very small percentage of people on the fringes of both sides.  Add to that the admitted use of FBI undercovers on both sides (participating, and who knows what else), and you have yourself the gameplan of the deep state in every country we have overthrown in the last 10 years.  Their playbook works, and they are now using it on the populace.</p>

<p>Conspiracy used to be a place to talk about issues, without descending into name calling.  Seeing the term &quot;nazi sympathizer&quot; thrown around this subreddit is terrifying.  </p>

<p>Free speech is not a vague topic.  The loony right has a right to protest about whatever they want.  You give them power by paying attention.  </p>

<p>There are many that want to keep the left right paradigm going on here, so honest, good discussions about looking UP don&#39;t take place anymore.  </p>
