<p>Ignorance is not a bad thing on its own. Everyone has ignorance of different topics. But, being purposely ignorant is a different story.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll ask you two questions and then I&#39;ll answer any wu actions you have.</p>

<p>Do you genuinely want to have a substantive conversation without insults or pettyness/whataboutism in regards to the Trump/Russia conspiracy?</p>

<p>And secondly, are you genuinely willing to change your kind in th subject?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For more context</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnitsky_Act">When the Trump team says they were talking about adoptions, that was code for sanctions.</a></p>

<p>Russia stole money and companies from Bill Browder ( an American citizen) in Russia. They kicked Browder out and once they received his company, Russian oligarchs used the companies documents to receive several hundred million dollars in a tax refund from the government, which is probably one of the biggest tax scams committed by the Russian government (and Putin).</p>

<p>They did this to Browder because he was exposing the corruption of the Russian oligarchs that were sending their money to Putin, and Putin was tired of it, so he labeled him a national security threat.</p>

<p>Browder fought back, and hired Sergei Magnitsky, a Russian top lawyer, to fight back against Putin&#39;s corruption. </p>

<p>Well Putin got tired of it, and arrested Magnitsky, and kept him in brutal conditions in prison for a year, and then brutally beat him to death with batons while in prison. </p>

<p>The US retaliated with the Magnitsky Act and placed heavy sanctions on dozens of corrupt Russian oligarchs. </p>

<p>Then Putin retalliated with the adoptions sanctions against American citizens. </p>

<p>So whenever you hear talk about &quot;they were just talking about adoption policy&quot; that means they were talking about removing the Magnisky act and other sanctions on Russia&#39;s corrupt government officials. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bill Browder recently testified to the Senate Judiciary Committee about the Magnitsky Act and how it relates to Putin, Trump, and the Trump Jr. meeting where they discussed &quot;adoption sanctions.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/07/bill-browders-testimony-to-the-senate-judiciary-committee/534864/">Here&#39;s the transcript of the hearing</a></p>

<p>All of the people that were sanction were the most powerful and richest oligarchs in Russia. Russia is a mafia state, and those oligarchs give 50% of their income and assets to Putin. So when sanctions were placed on those oligarchs, it was essentially sanctions on Putin himself and it severely impacted the Russian economy overall. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>That all changed in July 2003, when Putin arrested Russia’s biggest oligarch and richest man, Mikhail Khodorkovsky. Putin grabbed Khodorkovsky off his private jet, took him back to Moscow, put him on trial, and allowed television cameras to film Khodorkovsky sitting in a cage right in the middle of the courtroom. That image was extremely powerful, because none of the other oligarchs wanted to be in the same position. After Khodorkovsky’s conviction, the other oligarchs went to Putin and asked him what they needed to do to avoid sitting in the same cage as Khodorkovsky. From what followed, it appeared that Putin’s answer was, “Fifty percent.” He wasn’t saying 50 percent for the Russian government or the presidential administration of Russia, but 50 percent for Vladimir Putin personally. From that moment on, Putin became the biggest oligarch in Russia and the richest man in the world, and my anti-corruption activities would no longer be tolerated.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In response to these sanctions, Russia placed sanctions on American citizens adopting Russian children. Trump and his family and his lawyers admit that Trump Jr., Jared Kushner, and Paul Manafort had a secret meeting with Russian government representatives, where they discussed &quot;adoption sanctions&quot;.</p>

<p>One of the Russians that attended this meeting was  Rinat Akhmetshin.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Magnitsky Act was based off of the evidence Bill Browder brought to the House and Senate. It was a huge bipartisan effort with <a href="http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2012/roll608.xml">365 Yeah votes to 43 Nays in the house</a> and <a href="https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=112&amp;amp;session=2&amp;amp;vote=00223">92 yeahs and 4 Nays in the Senate</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Except that Trump Jr. and his family/lawyers told us what was said. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>It was a short introductory meeting. I asked Jared and Paul to stop by. <strong>We primarily discussed a program about the adoption of Russian children that was active and popular with American families years ago and was since ended by the Russian government</strong>, but it was not a campaign issue at the time and there was no follow up.</p>

<p>I was asked to attend the meeting by an acquaintance, but was not told the name of the person I would be meeting with beforehand.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And as I just educated you on, adoption sanctions actual means the Magnitsky sanctions. Lets use your logic - Why would Trump Jr., Jared Kushner, and Paul Manafort talk about receiving Hillary Clinton dirt and the Magnistky act in the same meeting with Rinat Akhmetshin, whom Senator Grassley said previously is a Russian GRU spy who specializes in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_measures">active measures</a>?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well in my personal opinion it&#39;s because Hillary is one of the most evil fucks to ever live? Stole $2 billion from Haiti, Husband sexually assaulted how many people? Hillary intimidated the victims? The list goes on.</p>

<p>Now if I was Trump and loved my country and running against a fucking evil wench like that who you know 100% is controlled by globalists I would look for every piece of info on her from every source in <strong>ANY COUNTRY</strong>. But that&#39;s just me.</p>

<p>I suppose it could be some super conspiracy instead, not saying that&#39;s not possible just not as plausible.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Active measures ranged &quot;from media manipulations to special actions involving various degrees of violence&quot;. They were used both abroad and domestically. They included disinformation, propaganda, counterfeiting official documents, assassinations, and political repression, such as penetration into churches, and persecution of political dissidents</p>

<p>Retired KGB Maj. Gen. Oleg Kalugin described active measures as &quot;the heart and soul of Soviet intelligence&quot;: &quot;Not intelligence collection, but subversion: active measures to weaken the West, to drive wedges in the Western community alliances of all sorts, particularly NATO, to sow discord among allies, to weaken the United States in the eyes of the people of Europe, Asia, Africa, Latin America, and thus to prepare ground in case the war really occurs.</p>

<p>Past use of active measures has been revealed in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitrokhin_Archive">Mitrokhin Archive</a> by former KGB spies.</p>

<p>That&#39;s the type of people that Trump Jr., Jared Kushner, and Paul Manafort met with. They had a secret meeting with a litteral Russian GRU spy who specialized litterally in social media shilling and trolling.</p>

<p>TRUMP: She was sitting next to Putin and somebody else, and that’s the way it is.

<p>HABERMAN: You did?</p>

<p>TRUMP: <strong>We talked about Russian adoption. Yeah. I always found that interesting. Because, you know, he ended that years ago. And I actually talked about Russian adoption with him, which is interesting because it was a part of the conversation that Don [Jr., Mr. Trump’s son] had in that meeting.</strong> As I’ve said — most other people, you know, when they call up and say, “By the way, we have information on your opponent,” I think most politicians — I was just with a lot of people, they said [inaudible], “Who wouldn’t have taken a meeting like that?” They just said—— </p>

<p>Not really. He already has had large sources of Russian and Kazak mafia wealth pour into several different projects. He also was paid millions for the Miss Universe pageant from a company that gets it funding almost entirely from a state run Russian bank. </p>

<p>I think there is enough dirt to go around but I don&#39;t think there will be any impeachments or indictments,  I think its all a distraction while the deep state (consisting of neocons and neoliberals) is basically getting all the money and power it wants.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Magnitsky Act was based off of the evidence Bill Browder brought to the House and Senate. It was a huge bipartisan effort with <a href="http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2012/roll608.xml">365 Yeah votes to 43 Nays in the house</a> and <a href="https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=112&amp;amp;session=2&amp;amp;vote=00223">92 yeahs and 4 Nays in the Senate</a></p>

<p>I think it&#39;s logical to think that the vast majority of the house and the senate think he&#39;s a credible source. </p>

<p>Do you remember Donald Trump Jr.&#39;s email with Rob Goldstone? Were you following that news when it broke? Did you read the email?</p>
