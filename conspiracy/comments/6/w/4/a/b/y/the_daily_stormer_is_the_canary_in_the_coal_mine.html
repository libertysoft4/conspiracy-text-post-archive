        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;m sure many people here do not support the content of The Daily Stormer, and others will be happy to point out that I almost exclusively use Reddit for T_D, but I think anyone who cares about freedom and the internet should take note of this even if you find the Stormer repulsive.  </p>

<p>For anyone who did not know: in the wake of Unite The Right in Charlottesville, popular alt right website The Daily Stormer basically got deplatformed by every service that allowed them to be online.  GoDaddy, NameCheap, Cloudflare, SendGrid, and Google all dropped the Stormer (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/24/daily-stormer-has-officially-retreated-to-the-dark-web/">https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/24/daily-stormer-has-officially-retreated-to-the-dark-web/</a>).  This seems to have been triggered by the website joking about the woman who died in Charlottesville.</p>

<p>This is disturbing because this is the first time (to my knowledge anyway) that someone was so brutally deplatformed for their ideas.  The CEO of Cloudflare even said it was an arbitrary decision after explicitly defending ALL speech in the past: <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/08/cloudflare-ceo-the-people-behind-the-daily-stormer-are-assholes/">https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/08/cloudflare-ceo-the-people-behind-the-daily-stormer-are-assholes/</a> </p>

<p>Andrew Anglin from the Stormer has been providing updates on Gab.ai, which is a new free speech version of Twitter.  They&#39;ve been banned from the App Store and Google Play store basically for harboring characters like Anglin.</p>

<p>Obviously this establishes a new precedent, doesn&#39;t it?  We all know that since these are private companies, they aren&#39;t actually beholden to the First Amendment free speech principles we Americans value.  But then this raises questions about internet as infrastructure and a utility when a few companies can decide who gets to have their say and who does not.  Like, is it okay to be silenced over politics as long as it&#39;s an alliance of corporations with near monopolies rather than the government doing it?</p>

<p>I&#39;m interested to hear what people think about the future of the internet in light of this.  I&#39;ve always viewed the internet as the embodiment of the collective consciousness of civilized humanity, and to see it become <em>less</em> free over time is an indication that corporations are quite visibly tightening their grip on our collective consciousness.  Many will not miss the Stormer, but they will not be the last ones to lose their ability to reach people online.  This really looks like the early stages of some sort of cyberpunk dystopia.  </p>

It seems that whoever lets the Pirate Bay stay on the non-dark web would also host the Stormer site. (white nationalism is run by Zionists)</p>

<p>A company has the right to say who they will and will not do business with. That&#39;s the beauty of the free market. They can always go to another company that does want their business.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This kind of stuff always existed. What changed is what we find offensive, 100 years ago you could attack someone for their race or sex at work and you would probably be fine. 20 years ago it was their sexual orientation. It&#39;s not just &quot;liberal&quot; ideas that are protected, I&#39;m agnostic, but if I went to work and started attacking Christianity, Islam, Judaism, or any religion, I would be liable to be fired and would honestly deserve it. The work place is a professional environment, you should act professional there. And tbh, I wouldn&#39;t want to work with a racist or a white nationalist, I grew up in Southern California, a lot of my friends are Hispanic, I&#39;m also friends with people who are Arab or Muslim and others who are Jewish either religiously or by blood. If you go about spouting hate and anger, don&#39;t be surprised when people don&#39;t want to interact with you</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But like you said, the definition of &quot;hate&quot; changes.  Martin Luther King Jr. would have once been called hate speech by the established order.  Right now you seem to be okay with the current definition of &quot;hate speech&quot;, but what about the future definition of it?  Perhaps conspiracy theories will be targeted next.  After all, conspiracy theories make people shoot up pizza shops.  Maybe corporations will see it in their best interests to take conspiracy theories off the internet.  What&#39;s stopping them?  Nobody&#39;s standing up for the Stormer, who&#39;s gonna be left to stand up for the conspiracy community?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Didn&#39;t MLK only call for peaceful protest and making friends with the white man? I think only idiots could classify that as hate speech.  I think the main thing is that people should remain rational. Calling an entire race or religion evil or degenerate is obvious hate speech. Accidentally calling a transgender person by the wrong pronoun isn&#39;t. The white supremacists who want to attack anyone who isn&#39;t white are just as bad as the black supremacists doing the same against whites. We are all human, we shouldn&#39;t be dividing ourselves because of stupid things like race or religion. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re still missing the point.  &quot;Hate speech&quot; is a completely made up and subjective term.  So no, nothing is &quot;obviously hate speech&quot;.  I didn&#39;t say I think MLK spoke hatefully, but he was going up against the establishment back then and I&#39;m sure they had their own misrepresentations of his platform that they used to shut him down.  If they had corporate-controlled internet back then, maybe he would have been deplatformed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, it&#39;s in my opinion that companies follow what society does. Those companies were all perfectly fine providing a platform for stormer before the Alt-right existed. They were fine doing it up until the Charlottesville incident. They care about their dollar more than they do about hate speech, but when society turns against something, they follow suit because if they didn&#39;t they would lose more money from people boycotting them. If Google or GoDaddy didn&#39;t get rid of stormer they would eventually be faced with some type of outcry saying that they support neo-nazis. Reddit did the same thing with things like fatpeoplehate or coontown, they didn&#39;t care about them until an article was written painting reddit as a hive of scum and villainy. </p>

Dig fence being if you have a business that allows people to exercise their free speech you can&#39;t kick them out for doing it. My lawn and a business that allows people to publish to the world are a bit different situations.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think there is much of an argument to say publications largely centered around hate speech must be hosted on the internet, or broadcast, or otherwise disseminated.</p>

<p>I DO think there is an argument that you cannot punish someone for attempting to publish hate speech, as long as they are not attempting to incite violence.</p>

<p>This is a curious case regarding the first amendment, but I think there are two sides to it.  One being The Daily Stormer and the like, while the other side of things is Antifa.  How far do we let either side go?  If you ban The Daily Stormer, you should also ban Antifa.  Neither side can complain about the other so long as they both exist.</p>

<p>In reality, I think both should be kept within arm&#39;s reach of the law to minimize rioutous activity.</p>

<p>So far, I believe there enough laws on the books to handle everything fairly.  People are just riled up about things due to the controversial Presidential administration.</p>
