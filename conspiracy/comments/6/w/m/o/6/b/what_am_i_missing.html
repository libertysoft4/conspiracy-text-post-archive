        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hi all, I&#39;m not new to conspiracy theories I obviously enjoy them or I wouldn&#39;t be here. I&#39;m not new to the sub, I&#39;ve been lurking here for a little over a year. But I am new to 9/11 conspiracy theories. I have been vaguely aware of them over time, but only in the past two weeks have I jumped in to trying and figure them out. </p>

<p>Largely I think I must be missing something. I recently watched Loose Change which I was referred to by a friend who said it was a good starting point. It was an interesting film, but I struggled with a few issues in it;</p>

<ol>
<li>It&#39;s almost 90% mainstream media clips, when, generally speaking I don&#39;t trust the mainstream media.</li>
<li>The theories seem to lack a motive of any value. I understand that the purpose is to expose that 9/11 was an inside job, but what would be the purpose of such a thing?</li>
<li>Building 7 was pulled, so what? I don&#39;t understand the significance of this. It had been burning for several hours and the building was a loss.<br/></li>
<li>So we shot down United 93. What is useful about this information? All it does is to tarnish the &quot;fake&quot; heroic story of the people who would have rather died than let a terrorist control their destiny.</li>
<li>The attackers are pitched as muslim extremists, but painted as alcoholics and men who frequented prostitutes. I actually think this is in line with what we know about muslim extremist groups. They only are orthodox when it serves their purposes. </li>
</ol>

<p>So I guess I just don&#39;t get it? Can you guys help or guide me in a direction where any of this starts to make sense?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, so, what if oil isn&#39;t actually limited but free and endless, like air. If you were TPTB, wouldn&#39;t it make sense to artificially limit it, raise generations of people completely dependant on it, practically defunct any competing energy source, tax every human for using it because it&#39;s so &quot;precious&quot;? Precious enough to give your life in war for? To take lives for? My favorite part is that they&#39;ve doubled down on the gaslighting- now we are also guilty for using this resource that is endless but falsely limited. Now we should worry and feel guilty about our plastic grocery bags and the toy in our kids happy meal- to the point that there was a global summit to <em>further tax us all</em> for, what I believe is a renuable resource, based on ridiculous claims of &quot;man made climate change&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think clearing asbestos was really an option would have been a tear down costing billions just to get to a vacant lot. </p>

<p>Theory that works for me is silverstein goes to Israel and they set up a false flag terror attack to demolish. US deep state catches wind, they tact on the Pentagon to clear some accountants that know too much and in exchange for destabilizing middle east for Israel the US gets the war on terror so they can finally start terrorising their own people like the rest of the world. Towers are coming down whether US helps or not so they rush to take control of the presentation and the mistakes start to show.  If US stayed out of it they probably don&#39;t mess with the airplanes because they airplanes are only needed for the Pentagon. Jewish art students are easily recast as Palestinian contractors and if bombs go off no one is surprised the towers fall exactly like a controlled demo. Only the US would pick the exact wrong weapon for the job. </p>

<li>Is easy.  We invaded Afghanistan because of 9/11.  That does not prove anything significant but since Afghanistan, we have an opiate crisis and we have had a major stalemate within the country due to the terrain being advantageous to the enemy and my moonshiner family&#39;s tactic of border camping between Pakistan and Afghanistan.  They would cross the NC line to kill whoever the TN moonshiners wanted killed and then move across the TN line to kill whoever the NC moonshiners killed.  Because the FBI did not exist in that era.  They take advantage of the actual borders and the fact that we are not at war with their neighbors and it puts the US in pickle if we attack them across the border.  Especially the mountains too as they have the advantage geographically.  The only thing you can do is get a drone and fly it high to survey the area and then gain control of the best lookout in the region.  Not to mention the different factions that are now competing for control.<br/></li>

    <div class="md"><p>We don&#39;t need ME oil anymore because we went in and took it. Plus the US has a huge opioid epidemic all across the country that wasn&#39;t there before. You can blame big pharma and doctors for pushing prescription pain killers but also the CIA (who is famous for moving drugs) to bring this home. The Taliban shut down poppy production. The US put it into overdrive.  </p>
