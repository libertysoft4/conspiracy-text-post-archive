        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>&quot;Awan was released Tuesday on a “high-intensity supervision program,” according to a DOJ spokesman. He must wear a GPS monitor, abide by a curfew of 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. and cannot leave a 50-mile radius of his Lorton, Va., home. He was also forced to surrender his passports and is scheduled to reappear in court for a preliminary hearing Aug. 21.&quot;
-Politico</p>

<p>Does this make anyone else think something is going on behind the scenes? Is bank fraud usually treated that seriously? GPS monitor? Curfew? Seems pretty intensive, but then again, they did release him. Thoughts? </p>

<p>No, people are getting this wrong.  A lot of jurisdictions, including D.C., have been moving away from pretrial incarceration and money bail.  The court generally can&#39;t deny bail for criminal defendants charged with nonviolent offenses; they have to provide a protocol for supervised release.  Given the guy&#39;s a major flight risk -- they caught him trying to escape -- he&#39;d be slapped with additional conditions to keep tabs on him.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

<p>Well, in general a number of jurisdictions, including D.C., have been reforming their bail procedures.  Courts generally can&#39;t deny bail completely when the defendant isn&#39;t charged with a violent crime.  </p>

<p>The GPS monitor and curfew are the additional conditions imposed because he&#39;s an obvious flight risk, given that they caught him as he was trying to escape the jurisdiction.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>weird.  Maybe I watch too much law and order, seems like they deny bail very easily.  As this guy is a foreign national, thought it would be a slam dunk.</p>

<p>But your idea about bail reform makes sense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just happen to know this stuff because I was working on a project regarding bail reform.  It&#39;s become a major issue because poor people get fucked -- somebody picked up on a small charge can&#39;t pay the $150, they languish in jail and lose their job, can&#39;t pay the fine on the initial charge, interest and fees start piling up, etc. etc. -- people end up having their lives entirely derailed for a misdemeanor. </p>

<p>So, a ton of jurisdictions have changed their bail laws to create a presumption of release, with the judges required to impose only those conditions necessary to secure appearance at trial -- especially for non-violent offenders.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The thing I am most surprised at is the speed with which all these arrangements were made. I have had a lot of interactions with the legal system, this seems strange. In a normal situation, you could bail out, which by itself can take several hours or a day. But he is an obvious flight risk, which means he had to see a judge to make the decision on his conditions for release. That does not usually happen quickly either.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I used to work in a County level court in a major metropolitan area. This is seems very normal. If the DOJ process is anything like our processes were it would have gone like this: He was arrested and booked yesterday evening/night. He would have been interviewed by a court employee who would then prepare a pre-trial report for the Judge. The pre-trial report would have included a summary of the Defendant (Awan) and a recommendation for a bond amount and any pre-trial supervision conditions (GPS, Curfew, etc). The recommendations are based his offense, criminal history, flight risk factors, etc. The GPS is extremely normal considering Mr. Awan&#39;s high potential for flight risk. Along with the GPS monitoring the ISP unit is able to set exclusion zones, in this case, anything outside 50 miles of his home. The Judge ultimately has discretion to go along with the recommendation of the report or do whatever the fuck he/she feels like. The curfew is kind of strange. The curfew sanction was typically used for offenses like prostitution, drug dealing, etc not really bank fraud. The whole thing seems to have moved quite quickly. Unless he started singing as soon as they brought him in and cut a deal but who knows.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am assuming Mr. Awan, as connected as he is was able to just post the cash bond and not go through a surety. It may also be that he was granted a personal recognizance also. Either of those would expedite the release process.</p>
