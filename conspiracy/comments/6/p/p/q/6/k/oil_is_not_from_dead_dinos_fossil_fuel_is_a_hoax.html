        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>&quot;The Peak Oil school rests its theory on conventional Western geology textbooks, most by American or British geologists, which claim oil is a ‘fossil fuel,’ a biological residue or detritus of either fossilized dinosaur remains or perhaps algae, hence a product in finite supply. Biological origin is central to Peak Oil theory, used to explain why oil is only found in certain parts of the world where it was geologically trapped millions of years ago. That would mean that, say, dead dinosaur remains became compressed and over tens of millions of years fossilized and trapped in underground reservoirs perhaps 4-6,000 feet below the surface of the earth. In rare cases, so goes the theory, huge amounts of biological matter should have been trapped in rock formations in the shallower ocean offshore as in the Gulf of Mexico or North Sea or Gulf of Guinea.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.orgoniseafrica.com/no-peak-oil-abiotic-oil">https://www.orgoniseafrica.com/no-peak-oil-abiotic-oil</a></p>

<p>Colonel L. Fletcher Prouty spills the beans about how oil was deliberately, incorrectly classified as a fossil fuel, when in fact it is Abiotic.
As such, it is a replenishable, naturally occurring source. Peak oil is a myth, or more accurately, a lie. Just like almost everything else the establishment ever told you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>regardless of origin, I don&#39;t know if we&#39;ll ever see &quot;peak oil&quot; due to the increasing efficiency and heightened demand for renewable sources of energy.  By the time the peak oil was predicted (2030s) we may well be largely off of it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh yeah. Regardless of petroleum&#39;s origins, we need to get as far away from burning it as we can, as fast as we can. Unfortunately, it&#39;s just not going to happen until the market naturally supports a shift (i.e. more affordable alternate energy sources). However, I imagine we&#39;ll be using it for plastics for a far longer span, so it&#39;s not like the industry will just disappear overnight.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>my geochemistry book is just itching to write up how off your conclusion is. oil is biotic. here&#39;s how it goes: biogenetic methane is produced by the breakdown of buried organics during a thing called diagenesis. next catagenesis converts the biogenetic methane to kerogen which breaks down into bitumen... the simplest of carbon chains found in oil. there are also carbon isotope markers we can use to classify age, and maturity of an oil sample and approximately what it&#39;s composed of. you know what octane grade is? that&#39;s how well we understand the process. but peak oil is dead.. so we can agree on that </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Like all at once or over a period of time and billions if them? Because if it&#39;s the former I don&#39;t think the Earth would&#39;ve survived that impact. Or did it somehow reproduce and multiply here?</p>

<p>Also why wasn&#39;t any found on the moon? It&#39;s relatively close and has had millions of impacts. </p>

<p>Just curious by the way. Not trying to come off as aggressive.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>More the material is in the tail of the comet which as it passes close the Earth, causing a whole bunch of catastrophic effects, the tail is what the Earth actually passes through. The materials held in the comets tail enter the atmosphere. </p>

<p>Oil wasn&#39;t found on the moon because:
- No one has looked for it
- No one has been there ;) 
- It has seeped into the inner part of the moon (the moon is hallow BTW) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I attended a university class in the heart of Siberia a few years ago, a lecture called &quot;On the economy of oil and gas&quot;, dispensed by a professor formerly researcher at Gazprom and formerly geologist for the Soviet State.</p>

<p>I asked her: where does oil come from, is it really of biological origin?</p>

<p>In a very nonchalant (but kind) way she answered there are two theories, the fossil and abiotic theories, none of the 2 is either proven or dominant, that her colleagues are split half/half, and that she herself leans towards the abiotic hypothesis.</p>

<p>I was amazed at such a balanced, open-minded response. I thought to myself this would be unlikely in the West where fossil fuel theory is like a religion.</p>

Which meant that forest were not &quot;bio degradable&quot; for a couple of multiple millions of years trunk of fallen tree would just sit there until buried by other bio mass.</p>
