<p>While the earth&#39;s temperature DOES change and this affects the world&#39;s climate AND this is perfectly natural, i believe that the elite is using this fact to promote all sorts of lies related to global disasters caused by temperature rises in order to obtain more money that will be used in war and more war instead of actually improving the environment.</p>

<p>CO 2 is targeted because it is easily produced from factories and can be easily taxed, while worse greenhouse gasses like water steam and methane are more difficult to tax so they are not affected.</p>

<p>And just speaking of this fact gets you downvotes and callings in this sub.</p>

<p>Even Pizzagate and Anti-Trump/Anti Hillary posts don&#39;t gather as much hate as a post about global warming.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He actually has a point, hear me out. </p>

<p>Water vapour IS the most abundant greenhouse gas. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/monitoring-references/faq/greenhouse-gases.php?section=watervapor">https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/monitoring-references/faq/greenhouse-gases.php?section=watervapor</a></p>

<p>However, the water cycle is an intrinsic part of the earth, the climate is driven by the water cycle but more water in the atmosphere would also condense to form clouds and reflect the sunshine energy so the system is balanced at a &quot;background&quot; level. </p>

<p>The addition of industrial CO2, methane etc is an additional layer on top which is causing climate change as we know it. </p>

<p>So while OP has a vaguely valid point, the nuance of the explanation negates the thrust of his argument. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>But there is also a lot of methane which was previously trapped in permafrost and undersea clarates (that word may be wrong) which is increasingly being released due to the warming climate. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Siberia is the shallowest, last I heard 5-10% of its 1400 gigatones is vulnerable, with a 50gigatonne worst case scenario causing a twelve-food increase in atmospheric methane, causing warming twice as potent as current CO2. Other methane beds are deeper and aren&#39;t as problematic.</p>

<p>I was mainly referring to standarrd methane release where a significant portion is broken down in soil and trapped there. </p>

<p>Now im not saying I know the truth now. I really don&#39;t. There is so much disinformation and misinformation that it seems nearly impossible to figure out what is going on.</p>

<p>I wonder if global warming is a distraction from other issues? </p>

<p>The typical &#39;conspiracy theorist&#39; wants to see more people &#39;wake up&#39; and start asking more questions of their authorities. The climate change scam (and accompanying carbon credit scam) are far more likely topics to get people to question authority than fake shootings or fake aliens. If this sub ever spent even 10% as much time talking about fake science like climate change, it would become a force to be reckoned with.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely, the problem is that it&#39;s clouded under the continuous onslaught of people spouting the &quot;~97% of scientists agree that climate change is real&quot; argument rather than actually communicating the science that we know.  Instead of constantly reciting that number, assuming that people will automatically be convinced.  </p>

<p>A much better strategy would be to explain different carbon ratios and unsequestered vs. sequestered sources of carbon dioxide ... instead they keep repeating &quot;97%&quot; which isn&#39;t exactly a scientifically sound argument.</p>

<p>All of that then results in threads like these ...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My biggest issue with your idea is that the ones spreading it want money, and don&#39;t give a fuck about pollution and sustainable shit. They don&#39;t want self sustainers at all, which no one should be against. Even if global warming is crap, damage to our planet and the lack of concern for water sources etc is very harmful, and goes hand in hand with corruption and environmental deregulation, etc. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was a militant global warming advocate up until about a few months ago. Now I&#39;m not so sure. There is conflicting scientific data thrown around everywhere and the people propagating the idea of global warming lie about almost literally everything else. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Back in 2000 I studied Environmental Chemistry under professor <a href="https://blogs.adelaide.edu.au/researchtuesdays/2011/06/01/stephen-lincoln/">Stephen Lincoln</a> of Adelaide University. Of all the academics I studied under, this man impressed me the most with his intellect and teaching ability, and he taught that the whole global warming thing was simply part of a natural process, various reasons why CO2 couldn&#39;t be to blame, etc. We were examined on our understanding of that, too.</p>

<p>So, fast forward to recently and I was reflecting on that experience. I looked up the old prof to see what was up – surely, if he was still employed, he would have capitulated to the &#39;consensus&#39; narrative. But, to my surprise, not only have his opinions remained intact, he&#39;s now dean of the Environmental Chemistry faculty (previously inorganic chemistry) and has authored a tome titled <a href="http://booksplea.se/index.php?route=product/product&amp;amp;product_id=1508490&amp;amp;google=AUD">Challenged Earth: An Overview of Humanity&#39;s Stewardship of Earth</a>.</p>

<p>It was rather incongruous, so I went and searched to see what the environmentalists were saying about him, and they are basically invalidating his opinions by calling him a &#39;nuclear shill&#39;. I.e., his belief is that nuclear is the way to go. That seems smart to me, especially in Australia where there aren&#39;t ever any earthquakes and there&#39;s plenty of geologically inert earth where nuclear waste could be stored safely.</p>

<p>Anyway, that&#39;s my &#39;cool story&#39; :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do believe that the people who believe that &quot;global warming is fake&quot; is people who live way up the equator line and they probably have all seasons (spring, summer, autumn and winter) and they clearly doesn&#39;t notice the same climate changes that we do. For example, where I live I have NEVER seen snow and the most low temperature i have ever felt is 5 C.  Climate change is real, every year have been hotter. Last year one of the cities from my country hit 50 c. is that not fucking climate change to you i don&#39;t know what would be.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Heh, some of these people are the &quot;useless hoarders&quot; that have the arrogance to call us &quot;useless eaters&quot; (and whichever variety of that term.)</p>

<p>Hollywood in essence (imo) is mostly this pretentious platform for highlighting political issues through people that are idolized and borderline revered as half-gods by some, for taking insane amounts of money for the art of pretending in front of a camera. </p>

<p>Not gonna claim acting or the lifestyle itself is easy, but surely there are people in this world who should be paid the same amount for what they do based on merit and usefulness to the world.</p>

<p>.. and ..sometimes the occasional movie with actual depth to them are released. Usually that means it&#39;s less reliant on car chases and alien robots.</p>
