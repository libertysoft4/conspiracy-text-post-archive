        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">53</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2017-07-25 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/mistahbang.html">mistahbang</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I developed a theory on what will happen in the future of the United States, and inevitably the world. </p>

<p>More of a prediction combining a lot of things we already know or are aware of. </p>

<p>Ok, first off, a little bit of math. 
The US population as of 2016 is around 323,100,000, which of that number, 74,200,000 children are under the age of 18 years old and most likely not working, so the population of people who are old enough to work is at 248,900,000. 
Of these 248,900,000 people, 22,000,000 are self-employed.
The unemployment rate at the time of this post is 4.3%, or 10,702,700.
This is not completely accurate as it does not take into account the people who are not in the labor force which currently stands at around 95,000,000 people. 
Taking into account this number, the true unemployment rate of people at a working age is around 45% or 105,702,700. </p>

<p>So let&#39;s add some numbers of jobs that will be lost due to automation in the next decade:
3,500,000 Truck Drivers (From auto-pilot trucks)
3,500,000 <em>Estimated</em> Fast Food Workers (From automated systems)
12,300,000 Manufacturing Factory Workers (From automated robots)
Total: 19,300,000
I understand I did not get the entire list of jobs that are threatened or will be replaced by automation, but I wanted to be at the lower end of estimating to exemplify how serious the situation is regardless. </p>

<p>So possibly, in the next decade the unemployment rate might be 50%+ granted the birth/death rate stays consistent, which most likely will not be the case. As new articles suggest, the sperm rate and testosterone levels of men have dropped since the 50s due to chemicals in our food/air/water and there are less marriages in general, in fact, lowest amount of marriages in US history and divorce rates have gone up.  </p>

<p>What will happen to these 50% of people? What will they do? 
Live off of government welfare? Would we install a system of universal basic income? 
They have no skills outside of their specialized practices, low education, and have been bombarded with chemicals that stall any mental growth or knowledge retention.</p>

<p>This might sound like a dystopia, but there is a silver lining. </p>

<p>I am a self-employed artist. I make art, throw art shows, and do free lance graphic design projects. 
I interact with a wide variety of different people in different fields and have been able to get a feel for what is happening with the knowledge I researched regarding the unemployment dilemma. </p>

<p>I know corporate finance bankers, drug dealers, CPA accountants, real estate agents, stock brokers, restaurant owners, computer programmers, and the list goes on. </p>

<p>I will let you know there is a reoccurring sentiment that they all share.</p>

<p>My friend who is a banker and makes enormous amounts of money come to me depressed, tired from weekends of binge drug use and partying and vacationing, feeling unfulfilled, empty, a void, missing a purpose to life. </p>

<p>They same goes for all the different people I listed.</p>

<p>They come to me because they realized I do not pursue power, money, sex, status, or comfort.</p>

<p>I chose to be an artist so I can create something out of nothing.</p>

<p>To understand myself to a degree where I can express myself freely without judgment or putting a front. </p>

<p>These 50%+ unemployed people who sit at home, some contemplating suicide, some bored out of their fucking minds, some desperately trying to find other jobs will come to a conclusion with the ample amount of spare time they have.</p>

<p>They will pick up a hobby that interests them, and realize they actually have a talent for it. They will realize the pleasures of seeing your ideas become creations will bring you more joy than any other job or occupation. </p>

<p>They will realize that they define who they are and that to spend time creating is always time well spent. No regrets, no stress, no frustration, no desperation. </p>

<p>This will bring forth a new economy that is based around hand crafted goods, of artistic expression and creativity. We all feel it. I know you do. I know all my friends do. I know the strangers I talk to do. The desire of something more. The desire of purpose. The desire to know that this life actually means more than the cards we are dealt. </p>

<p>They write about the millennials all the time, of how we are hopeless and jump from job to job, how our attention span is piss poor.  </p>

<p>It is because we woke up from the bullshit and we are searching. We are searching for something that defines us to our core, to be real, we want something fucking real because innately we know all of this is fake. Whats more real than that doodle you drew while thinking about stuff of at work? Whats more real than you arranging your belongings in a certain way cause it pleases you? Whats more real than taking a deep breath of fresh air in the mountains and being joyful with life?</p>

<p>Pick up a hobby in which you create, where you visually witness your ideas come to fruition. Keep it on the side of your job which will most likely disappear in the coming times but you will have something to fall back on.</p>

<p>TPTB created this mess, but we are here to end it. And we will do it with the art of self-expression, our first love. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>And I sit reading this in my 8x8 white office with no windows tied to my computer hating my job and wanting more. I have a passion for woodworking, people tell me all the time I need to sell what I make. Well with a family and a 40 hour a week job I don&#39;t really have time for that. Sure I can get some stuff done but nothing that makes me satisfied really. All I want is to cut back to a part time job or no job at all and totally pursue woodworking. It worked for Jesus right?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Self employed master race checking in. Boy is it worth it, and I think you&#39;ve skillfully spotted a clear trend. Content creation, or rather &#39;stuff&#39; creation, in whatever way shape or form, will become an increasingly attractive field as corporate wageslave positions become ever scarcer and competitive. The 13 year old youtube kids doing crappy lets plays are actually accumulating skillsets with incredibly longevity. Video editing, social media management to promote their channels, basics of video/audio recording, basics of design, etc. will all be worth gold in the near future. And perhaps more importantly, the ability to efficiently self teach, will be the single most important skill the have in the near future.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Amazing Post man!! I completely agree with you and I think about this too! We will move towards a true brotherhood and sisterhood of man. We all are part of the equation and will move towards a world where we must do our own part to survive. Thanks to social media. We realize more and more every day that we all have something to give, something unique to ourselves. To give to this planet and live off of it!</p>

<p>So go find some time to do something!</p>

<p>Hope to see you there, soon my friends! </p>

<p>LOVE TO YOU ALL! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think people do need meaning in their life, but they are sometimes not very good at finding it. People get stuck in TV, partying, socialising, drinking etc, rather than being artistic. Many people are stuck within seeking pleasures and entertainment. The novel Brave New World I think gives a good example of one possible endpoint for our civilisation and there it does not end in artistic expression.</p>

<p>My favourite source of wisdom, Lahotar, often considers the state of the world, and in quote says:</p>

<p>&#39;Humans r own worst enemies,always self deceiving,repeating mistakes,procrastinating,prefering drug of entertainment. Only v few will escape.&#39;</p>

<p>My personal view is that the most meaningful thing one can do is self-development. Here Lahotar says:</p>

<p>&#39;The material world is only meant to be a trial for developmental reasons,look beyond it to infinite. Don’t get trapped by color form n shape&#39;</p>

<p>I know some people will turn to art as you say, but I fear that many won&#39;t, and the future looks bleak for them</p>
