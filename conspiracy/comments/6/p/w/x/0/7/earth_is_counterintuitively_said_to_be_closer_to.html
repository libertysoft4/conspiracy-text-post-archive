        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><a href="http://en.es-static.us/upl/2014/01/aphelion-perihelion-earth.jpg">A difference of 3 million miles</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Though not responsible for the seasons</strong>, Earth’s closest and farthest points to the sun do affect seasonal lengths. </p>

<p><strong>Earth is closest to the sun every year in early January, when it’s winter for the Northern Hemisphere. We’re farthest away from the sun in early July, during our Northern Hemisphere summer.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>If this [observation - easily misinterpreted] has no causal effect on the seasons how then does it have a <strong>causal effect on season length</strong>. The answer given is the Axis.</p>

<p><a href="http://earthsky.org/tonight/earth-comes-closest-to-sun-every-year-in-early-january">Link to article</a></p>

<p>The difference in distance is 3 million miles or roughly 3%. If 3% produces no effect - we then have a problem with the distance of Venus comparatively to the Earth. </p>

<p>Earth 92,000,000 miles.</p>

<p>Venus 67,000,000 miles.</p>

<p>The ~3% distance difference in Earths relation to the sun can be comparative to Venus ~28% difference. ~70% the distance of Venus to Sun vs Earth. If 3% causes no effect [negligible or indeterminate] then Venus should yield 10x that effect. Whatever the measured effect seen on Venus should be 10 times less on Earth. [With linear physical interaction]</p>

<p>Following along? Good. Venus is said to not have seasons because the axis-tilt is negligible and the planet is nearly upside-down[sic] (NASA).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Earth has seasons because its rotation axis is tilted by about 23 degrees, which changes the intensity of sunlight and the length of the day in each hemisphere throughout the year. <strong>However, Venus has been tilted so much, it&#39;s almost completely upside down</strong>, leaving it with a net tilt of less than three degrees from the sun, so the seasonal effect is negligible,&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&quot;Upside down&quot; must be in relation to something. </p>

<p>When NASA discusses Venus there is a causal relation between planetary distance to the sun.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Also, its orbit is even more circular than Earth&#39;s, which prevents it from getting significantly hotter or cooler by moving closer to or further away from the sun. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>But not for Earth. </p>

<p>ESA claims they sent a probe to Venus and found -157C on the poles.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But measurements taken by Venus Express at an altitude of 130 to 140 kilometers (81 to 87 miles) above the surface have revealed the atmosphere near the poles has temperatures far below that on Earth. <strong>In fact, the polar atmosphere on Venus drops to -157°C (-251°F), which is 70 degrees colder than expected.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>If we look at solar irradiance for Venus compared to Earth - in NASA&#39;s claimed statistics there is a difference: </p>

<table><thead>
<tr>
<th align="left">Solar irradiance (W/m2)</th>
<th align="left">Earth</th>
<th align="left">Venus</th>
<th align="left">Difference</th>
</tr>
</thead><tbody>
<tr>
<td align="left">SI</td>
<td align="left">2601.3</td>
<td align="left">1361.0</td>
<td align="left">1.911</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>In this claimed data we see there is a difference in watts/m2. One would deduce this is from the difference in distance but also consider the size or stated mass. The difference in size is 1.2ratio, and the difference in distance is 0.7ratio. Thus we get ~1.9. This suggests the watts/m2 is directly related to the distance. <strong>Suggesting a causative relationship between temperature / solar irradiance and distance.</strong></p>

<p>Keep in mind its very hard to track down real observable data. Some of this is open to falsifiability depending on whether these figures were created from theoretical modelling vs. observation. The reason <em>&quot;scientists are surprised&quot;</em> appears in headlines so often is because theory doesn&#39;t meet observational data. This means the theoretical modelling is <strong>wrong</strong>. Falsified.</p>

<p>Proper scientific theory is predictive. There&#39;s a reason for that. Something doesn&#39;t add up in these models. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also there are obfuscating efforts or dissemination of information. For instance lets pretend the <a href="https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/neptunefact.html">Neptune Factsheets</a> are based on purely experimental observational data.</p>

<p>If we want to know the temperature of Neptune -</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Temperature at 1 bar: 72 K (-201 C)</p>

<p>Temperature at 0.1 bar: 55 K (-218 C)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is 1 atmosphere and 0.10 atm respectively - compared to Earth. But in the same information set we see: <strong>Surface Pressure: &gt;&gt;1000 bars</strong></p>

<p>Temperature and pressure are causally linked in all experiments on earth. All laboratory experiments.</p>

<p>Earth&#39;s atmosphere is <a href="https://www.avs.org/AVS/files/c7/c7edaedb-95b2-438f-adfb-36de54f87b9e.pdf">said to be 0.1 atm at 100km</a> so where do they define the edge of Neptune[?]. </p>

<p>If the surface is 1000 bars, or 1000x that of Earth and temperature is correlated to pressure - what does that say about the inside of the planet[?].</p>

<p>Look at the temperature variation just within the Earth. So now at different layers of atmosphere we have extreme temp differences. Yet  they state the temperature of Neptune by the outside perspective. If surface pressure is 1000 bars, then the only temperature which can be considered relevant is then the surface temperature.</p>
