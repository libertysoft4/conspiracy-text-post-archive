We have all heard about the pedophile problem with the extremely wealthy. Trump is extremely wealthy. And with Podesta, we find an issue with politicians and pedophilia. Trump is also a politician. We know he has had extensive ties with the Clintons in the past as has Podesta. So, Trump is a part of all these groups. These images take on a different tone under that lighting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My theory is that Trump has been infiltrating all of the pedo industries to take names and numbers and bring the elite pedo-ring down: the pageants, Hollywood, Russian bride trade, etc.</p>

<p>I won&#39;t say for a moment that it is because he cares about the kids. It&#39;s likely out of greed and he just wants a level field. If he brings down pedo-currency, he just tripled his wealth.</p>

<p>“I remember putting on my dress really quick because I was like, ‘Oh my god, there’s a man in here,’” said Mariah Billado, the former Miss Vermont Teen USA.</p>
