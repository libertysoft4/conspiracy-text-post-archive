    <div class="md"><p>Well, you must understand that, even if some celebrities/musicians WANTED to come out and expose them, as I said above, they would either be accused of being mentally ill, or &#39;commit suicide&#39; or &#39;overdose&#39; on drugs. Assuming they do know what&#39;s happening, they must also know that all those deaths weren&#39;t coincidences. It would take someone with BALLS to come out and expose them and still, he&#39;ll need resources, he&#39;ll need people behind him, he&#39;ll need a platform. But WHO do you trust in such a vile, untrustworthy environment? Prodigy LITERALLY talked about the Illuminati: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHhgJG8U_7I">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHhgJG8U_7I</a></p>

<p>He died at the age of 33. Coincidence, once again? </p>

<p>Amanda Bynes had a full on mental break down in front of the whole world. She was rumored(I think, I don&#39;t know if it was ever confirmed) to have been abused by one of her producers when she was younger. Kanye West tried to speak out but was IMMEDIATELY rushed to be re-programmed. There is a facility in L.A, apparently it&#39;s a non-profit hospital or something(can&#39;t remember what it&#39;s called, but im sure someone knows here), and literally the majority of celebrities who have similar &#39;mental break downs&#39; are &#39;treated&#39; there. My point is, it&#39;s really not that easy as just logging onto twitter and saying &#39;Hey y&#39;all, just so you know, The Elite is real, Illuminati is real, the industry/world is full of pedophiles and people are literally being murdered left and right&#39;. And as I said above, even if they DO speak out, they are meet with accusations of mental illness, drugs or any other excuse they can find. And the majority of the GP is falling for it EVERY. DAMN. TIME. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right, and I have seen all of what you just explained, yet I am still baffled. I agree with you, that someone has to have some major BALLS and essentially accept that they will have to be a martyr for the cause, but is their anyone who cares enough?</p>

<p>It&#39;s sad to see these celebs (although for some of them it is hard to feel bad) after they have tried to get the message out. They&#39;re just not the same anymore, and you can see it in their eyes. Their mental state is severely broken down and like you said, this is usually relayed to the public as a form of mental health recovery or care. </p>

<p>We need someone in a reliable position of power with enough influence to REALLY get the ball rolling. Someone that most people would believe. Another problem is keeping the media content alive. If someone were to come out and say something, how long would it exist before being removed? Most things cannot be removed completely. Combine that with the MULTIPLE daily distractions catered specially for each of us, and then... what? WHO CARES! That was so yesterday, man. Check out this insane fidget spinner video!</p>

<p>Fuck.</p>

<p>I know it is NOWHERE near as easy as the way I made it sound, especially because of the compartmentalized control that this shadow gov&#39;t operates, no one says anything without them knowing or editing it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I definitely feel you. As someone who is very interested in Music, I actually wanted to purse a career in the Industry and have studied Music Technology and Innovation in College. But learning so much about what actually happens in the Entertainment industry made me change my mind, because I do NOT want to find myself in such vile environment. I so desperately want GOOD to prevail and for SOMEONE or a group of people to come out and expose EVERYTHING, I desperately want that. But unfortunately, i don&#39;t see it happening anytime soon. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Glad that this resonated with you! This is one of my all-time favorite ways to express the idea that i&#39;m attempting to convey. </p>

<p>Without the poor, the rich cannot exist.</p>

<p>Without the foundation and building blocks of the pyramid, the cap serves no purpose.</p>

<p>If anyone turns a pyramid upside down, the weight of the foundation would destroy the cap into pieces.</p>

<p>We ARE the foundation. It is our time to take back our lives. Life was not meant to be this way. We are slaves in an artificial construct.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is precisely correct. We also have a unique opportunity to take back our lives since all these leaks confirmed our many suspicions of living in a slave planet. </p>

<p>We cannot hold off on taking back our lives forever. Eventually, we will die and the next generations will not even know about this era so they may regain a brainwashed planet all over again which would end up costing the world ages of wasted time. We have to stop this thing now. </p>

<p>I can&#39;t emphasize this anymore. It has to be stopped NOW. We have a lot of white hats waiting for us to make a move so they can support our cause. Fuck banks, fuck government. They all have to go and we need to rebuild a much more humane system to replace it all. In the meantime, we need to all live by the common moral code and yes, we all have a moral compass inside of us (don&#39;t let the sneaky media  or bought off religions trick you into thinking humans are naturally evil). They are naturally good but the system is designed to bring out the worst in people so people often get tricked. </p>

<p>Anyone donating to church or foundations has to stop. We need to stop paying taxes. Hell, we need to stop using money and working for the sake of building a wealthy planet. At the very least, we need to march. </p>

<p>If we stop using money and everyone works for free, then protestors would be OK since they can pick up food and water for free while protesting. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m assuming the &quot;you,&quot; that was used above is the plural &quot;you all,&quot; and not directly referring to me, because although I may not have worded it well, I was very aware of the Kanye situation. What I am saying now is... That time has gone. He tried and failed, along with many others...</p>

<p>But SOMEONE, WILL get the balls to say it. Someone MUST speak up for us and take a stand and when it happens, WE must support them.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I feel that I am lost in the hope that someone will break this shit open for EVERYONE to see. Something so big that there is a shift in consciousness and awareness. I know that I am really just day-dreaming here, but i&#39;m afraid that they&#39;ll end up like most of the past examples: re-programmed and mentally brutalized.</p>
