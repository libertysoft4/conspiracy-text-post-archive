<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Today, <a href="https://twitter.com/KibBitzLaw/">Victory of the Light</a> teased that the disclosure process is beginning and even cryptically tweeted at <a href="https://twitter.com/KibBitzLaw/status/889537473340198912">Tom Delonge</a> that we are not far off. I want to dig into what VoTL and Tom Delonge are claiming, and whether or not we should be wary/skeptical of this imminent disclosure event.</p>

<h2>Managing Magic</h2>

<p>I recently read a book called Managing Magic: The governments UFO disclosure plan by Grant Cameron. In this book Cameron makes a compelling case for the &quot;Magicians&quot; and the &quot;Messiahs&quot; in relation to the UFO phenomena. The &quot;Magicians&quot; are people like <a href="https://tothestars.media/blogs/news/read-jim-semivans-foreword-for-sekret-machines-chasing-shadows-paperback-edition">Jim Semivan</a> who are responsible for feeding the information to a given &quot;Messiah&quot; who in this instance is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_DeLonge">Tom Delonge</a>. What happens is that essentially the govt chooses someone with a large following and spoonfeeds their ego such that they feel they are the only capable person of bringing this sensitive information to the public. Grant Cameron talks extensively about this in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9686CJRpUIM">this video</a>. He also talks about how Military think tanks have planned a disclosure process for over 30 years now with the intention of priming humanity&#39;s subconscious for disclosure by embedding the ideas in fiction and pop culture. As I&#39;m sure most are aware, Tom Delonge&#39;s project Sekret Machines is meant to put the ideas of the UFo phenomena into fiction first revealing the reality of Remote Viewing projects and metaphysical realities.</p>

<h2>Tom Delonge</h2>

<p>If Tom Delonge is the govt&#39;s chosen &quot;Messiah&quot;, then can we really trust him? A few days ago Tom posted <a href="http://imgur.com/a/A2r2r">this</a> heavily implying that some type of disclosure event will be occurring very soon and VoTL&#39;s tweet to him seems to imply that VoTL believes we are in the beginning stages as well. Tom Delonge was in contact with John Podesta as we found out during wikileaks and it seems that he was the chosen Messiah for this message dating back a few years. This led me to conclude that Delonge&#39;s handlers (Magicians) had intended for HRC to win and had an entire roadmap laid out for that timeline. When Trump won, Delonge posted a lot to social media that there was a wrench in the plans but that something would materialize shortly. All of that hype and we are at this point, which the most hyped up post Tom has ever made being 3 days ago. The question to ask yourself is: What were Delonge&#39;s Magicians planning to disclose if HRC won vs a Trump victory? Is this some type of newer Project Blue Beam agenda?</p>

<h2>Victory of the Light</h2>

<p>I have followed VoTL since the beginning and they have sparked my curiosity far more than I ever anticipated. For those unaware VoTL claims to be in contact with Pleaidan guides and they are apart of the COBRA resistance group which has some loose ties to Corey Goode/David Wilcock. Without taking a stance on whether or not they are in contact with actual ETI, their sources appear to be legitimate and their insider information is what is most valuable part about the twitter account. If they can be believed (and they seem to have insider info on the #swordfish leaks) then this disclosure event is imminent and will be very public. They have hyped up the Sept 23 date and the impending July 27 date that WH anon just confirmed.</p>

<h2>Disclosure?</h2>

<p>I believe that there appears to be an imminent disclosure type event that has been in the works for a long time within resistant intelligence groups across the United States Government. This disclosure event seems to have multiple factions yet they all seem to be receiving similar insider information. I only bring this information forward to discuss whether or not this will be soft or full disclosure and whether or not you guys believe these contacts to be legitimate.</p>

<p>EDIT: What are your guys&#39; thoughts on Delonge and VoTL?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The term Messiah is used by Cameron because he points out that the military targets people with big egos who believe themselves to be Messiahs. So in this scenario Delonge only BELIEVES he&#39;s a Messiah. He thinks he&#39;s the one with the most information on the UFO phenomena and he&#39;s the only one who can bring the truth to the public which we all know is false.</p>

<p>In all actuality it&#39;s really not that crazy.  Delonge has been obsessed with UFOs for literally forever, has done legitimate work with the disclosure movement and he has a very sizeable following from blink-182 and AVA.  He would be the perfect pop culture figure to help roll this out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t recall calling him a shill, larper or crazy liar. In fact, I&#39;m usually one of the people on here who&#39;s always posting in VOTL threads. I follow his Twitter pretty closely, but I don&#39;t have anyone to talk to about it in my real life. So I like to talk about the various things I notice about it on here.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know why you&#39;re being so defensive. I never said he had to be perfect, I was merely replying to &quot;I haven&#39;t seen a single red flag yet&quot;.</p>

<p>I have seen what I would consider red flags. Does it mean he&#39;s a larper? No. Does it mean he&#39;s a shill? No. Does it mean he&#39;s a crazy liar? No.</p>

<p>Does it mean I don&#39;t unconditionally believe it all with 100% of my being? Yes. Hence why I said it&#39;s a &quot;red flag&quot; <em>for me</em>. </p>

&quot;We have to give a little bit of a benefit of a doubt. Maybe Defango doesn&#39;t even know he&#39;s fucking with Satanists. You guys know some people get sucked in and don&#39;t even know it until it&#39;s too late. People are told they are doing good works. An eastern star lady told me all they do is service work. For 97% of these organizations it&#39;s true. The people at the lowest levels are not usually the ones in the know. All these younger ops are just being brought in. D, my love, if all the agents in this room raised their hands you&#39;d shit your computer chair. ﻿&quot;</p>

<p>Satanists? Check. Intelligence Services? Check.</p>

His stuff rings true but I have slightly different theories on this stuff. I believe they will come out with the &quot;malevolent&quot; ones first and then in comes the &quot;benevolent&quot; ones to save humanity. I believe they are two sides of the same coin just like politics, magic, &quot;aliens&quot; are the same. I won&#39;t trust any of them. The great deception is coming.

    <div class="md"><p>One of the reasons I have suspected a trap. That fucking name has bothered me since day one. I don&#39;t care what it&#39;s an amalgam for. Compression resistance breakthrough...something</p>

<p>Only thing symbolically relevant is that the resistance movement is underground. But the snake affiliation is not cool. </p>

<p>Allthe alien talk on the cobra site I can&#39;t disprove. Can&#39;t prove it though either. Some times I suspect a larp to sell rocks. Of all things. As he will go months without saying anything important, then all of a sudden everyone needs a fifty dollar rock to help ground the planet in a special way. Those are classic gimics used in religion. It&#39;s very unnerving. All and all he posts maybe one piece of pertinent info a month. People hang on those words but it&#39;s more the people doing any progress than him or some group saving us that we never met.</p>

<p>We have to get very expensive tachyon chambers. Etc. These are props that aren&#39;t efficiently proven to do anything. For all I know the stones are nothing. But apparently we are Waiting on people to buy them to ground the light energies. What&#39;s with the economical approach to liberation from an economical approach?</p>

<p>This whole thing is fishy as hell. The man says he has been to other planets. Withholds everything. Supposedly he has all this Intel. Just withholds it and releases very minor snippets about tptb that users of this sub already post. And all proof of aliens is obscured , convoluted, conjectured. Not a single tangible physical piece of evidence.</p>

<p>He posts pictures of places in China. Not one explanation. Talks about portals opening. Where? To an underground world that hates us?? Again, no evidence just a carrot of a potential event supplanted with a unproven contact with e.t.</p>

<p>So what is one supposed to believe in all of that?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I find it amazing how easily non religious people accept the existence of aliens because EVOLUTION baby! But they refuse to even entertain the possibility that aliens are the fallen angels and demons of the bible because if demons are real...so is God. They believe some benevolent aliens are going to come here and save us all from ourselves but the idea of Christ the Redeemer coming here to save those who believe is LUDICROUS! </p>

<p>The more time goes on the more true the bible and its warnings become to me. Sure you can argue that TPTB wrote the bible and therefore are just bringing about their plan as they wrote it. Ok...why the agenda to attack Christianity, remove it from school, turn believers into atheist evolutionists, murdering of Christians all over the world, destruction of secular governments who protected Christians, promotion of luciferian religions in all its many forms? If it is but a fable written up by TPTB to enslave mankind what made them stop promoting it and instead attacking it?</p>

<p>I am not some uneducated bible thumper. I am a truth seeker. I don&#39;t care what the Truth turns out to be I just want it. I was brought up Christian. When I was a teenager I quit going to o church and decides God wasn&#39;t real. I had way too many questions that nobody wanted or could answer. So I began my solo journey. I studied everything. Psychology, Ethics, Evolution, Buddhism, Jainism, Hinduism, Shintoism, Gnosticism, Judaism, Kabbalah, Catholicism, Islam, etc etc.</p>

<p>I have called myself Buddhist, Hindu, Gnostic (still makes the most sense to me). I found truth in all these things as well as many problems. I have had personal experiences where I was saved by God and specifically Jesus when I shouted out for him seconds away from certain death. I feel the Lord I feel Jesus. I came full circle back to Christianity with Gnostic applications feeling the most true to me. </p>

<p>Just walk around talking about Jesus(Yahushua) sometime. People hate it. They can&#39;t stand the word. </p>

<p>I believe a great deception as prophesied in the bible is coming. I believe that great deception will be the alien lie and the proliferation of the one world religion(new age). I am not here to convert anyone I am just here to offer my take on the way I see things progressing around me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Indeed. My name has multiple meanings behind it and I chose it for numerous reasons. One of those is that I hope one day people will look back to it or browse their my comment history after the time of Jacob&#39;s Trouble has begun and eventually they will one day go &quot;huh, maybe those Christians weren&#39;t so Crazy afterall...&quot; Mind you I fully intend to NOT be here when that day comes. It&#39;s a parting gift of truth of sorts.</p>

<p>Your comment mentioned a critical point that I loved, it&#39;s not about being a Bible &quot;thumper,&quot; it&#39;s about genuinely seeking the <strong>TRUTH</strong>. And like it or not people, the Truth is contained in the Word of God. Jesus is the Truth, the Way, and the Life afterall. None shall come to the Father except through Him.</p>

<p>Truth is quite uncomfortable at times. It&#39;s hard to admit that we are all imperfect sinners, that most of our deeds are evil, that we were born into a fallen world under a sentence of death. But it is Truth nonetheless. When I started my spiritual journey not too long ago that was one of my goals: 1) Learn the truth 2) Speak the truth. Unashamed, unabridged, uncensored, NOT the politically correct watered/dumbed down version that we see spread around today.</p>

<p>You nailed another point in that if TPTB were responsible for authoring the Bible and using it to fulfill &#39;their&#39; wishes (as so many on this sub are under the delusion of), then why in the hell would they fight against it so hard? It makes no logical sense. If they were responsible for it, then they would be pushing FOR it, not so vehemently AGAINST it like they do.</p>

<p>I like to slighly modify a quote from the X-Files to come up with this: &quot;<strong>They</strong> want <strong>You</strong> to <em>believe</em>...&quot;</p>

<p>Believe in lies such as aliens, pleidians, reptilians, and on and on that is. Just as long as you don&#39;t come to believe in the <strong>TRUTH</strong>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Beautiful points.</p>

<p>Go looking for the Truth and you are bound to find Jesus. You are also bound to find the devil. Then you have to choose a side. Everything falls into place.</p>

<p>All the self proclaimed redpilled people out there. The alien deception is what I call the blackpill. If you do not have Jesus and you accept these alien who show up, and I do believe they will in my lifetime and very soon it seems, you will have your redpills negated. This blackpill is their ultimate secret weapon. Basically a vaccine against the redpills.  You will be bluepilled at that point. Then you accept their chips, their tech, their augmentation, transhumanist garbage and you are all but lost at that point. Accept Jesus. Embrace the Holy Spirit. Receive the discernment.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ughh, it&#39;s so easy for me to take for granted that there is a ton of mis-information out there regarding what this sign actually represents. That site you listed is definetly one of them. I won&#39;t spend too much time bashing it, but I should point out several things they get wrong:</p>

<p><strong>Ignoring The Very Next Verse</strong></p>

<p>It&#39;s ironic that what they use to disprove the meaning of this Great Sign, is the VERY thing that seperates this sign from ALL the others that have come before it that were &quot;close but no cigar&quot;. An 80% fulfillment of prophecy is not 100% like this is. Even below they attempt to show this sign was at Jesus&#39; supposed birth in 9/11/3bc, but when you look that date up in astronomy software you will find that there is no symbolic pregnancy with a retro-grade orbit in the &#39;womb&#39; of the gestation period like you find in this years fulfillment, only that Jupiter passes &#39;through,&#39; therefore is NO symbolic pregnancy. The pregnancy is the key portion of this sign that seperates it from all others that were &quot;close&quot;. Details matter people...</p>

<p><strong>&quot;Caught Up&quot; vs &quot;Ascended?&quot;</strong></p>

<p>Ironically, despite this author having another article that downplays the rapture, they failed to use the actual greek words in this context to attempt to prove their point. None of the verses listed in Luke, Mark or Acts use the word &#39;harpazo&#39;. You can&#39;t use english texts to argue the meaning of Biblical words, you MUST go back to the source language!! The words used to describe Jesus ascension are completely different than the meaning behind &#39;harpazo&#39;.</p>

<p>I&#39;m already tired of reading this article (i&#39;ve seen it before btw). They don&#39;t even mention the second valid interpretation of the &#39;woman&#39; which represents Israel, let alone the 3rd. They bash Scottie Clarke alot, I suggest you go actually watch his videos and see what you think rather than reading their jaded opinion of him, particular the Part One &amp; Two videos : <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/eternalrhythmflow/videos">Scottie Clarke YouTube</a></p>

<p>They also miss about a dozen other symbolic and numerical patters that all point to 2017 being a year of prophetic continuation... Articles like this (and others like it, such as the false Jesuit Catholic Astronomer organization that poorly attempts to debunk it and flat out lies in their &#39;facts&#39;) which by no coincidence appears as the top Google search results unfortunately. </p>

<p>To me it&#39;s almost as if people don&#39;t WANT it to be true. I rarely see people that humble themselves before God, and pray for discernment, truth &amp; wisdom (I did, still do). It&#39;s like they think there is NOTHING more contained within the Living Word of God, and that all the scholars over the last 2k years figured it all out and there&#39;s nothing left to discover. It&#39;s almost as if they purposely are ignoring the prophecies in Daniel that talk about information being locked up until the &quot;last days&quot;, just as it is now. Sorry, it really gets to me and i&#39;m pretty tired of it by now ...</p>

<p>Please see a previous comment I made that compiles some of the info (there&#39;s so much it&#39;s ridiculous). There are several links contained within there as well. I&#39;ll list a few below too.</p>

<hr/>

<p>I refer a lot of people to Unsealed.org because I feel it has the largest compilation of info online to date about this subject, and they have done a good job defending the validity of this sign against  the blind nay-sayer&#39;s that don&#39;t have (nor asked) for the wisdom to discern what it truly means. I have no affiliation with them whatsoever, and it&#39;s by no means the only source I use. I read many things from many places, and this is the best source of truth I have yet found that compiles a ton of information on this subject.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have not made up my mind nor did I mean to frustrate you. I appreciate your words and your links. I have read the first link so far and am working my way down. </p>

<p>So far I have a couple thoughts. </p>

<p>Firstly &quot;However, a woman in labor is not standing when she gives birth, she&#39;s lying prone, and that&#39;s exactly how the alignment is arranged in the sky - the woman is lying prone with her feet up and the moon is directly below her feet, almost as a pillow of sorts. &quot;</p>

<p>I disagree with this as many women give birth standing, my wife for example, though I will concede this is not the norm.</p>

<p>I have studied pretrib rapture at length and have been convinced that it is not accurate. If you can prove otherwise I am open to it but as my beliefs stand now I do not agree with the proposal that rapture could occur on sept 23.</p>

<p>Back to the links. Thank you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Please know that my frustration has nothing to do with you and entirely on what I have read over and over again online from others that genuinely seem like they don&#39;t &quot;want&quot; this sign to be true, and not genuinely analyzing it with Biblical eyes of discernment. The fact that you are even researching into it is fantastic, many people won&#39;t even bother to give it any time of day and seem to be under the delusion that the state of the world we live in can just go on indefinetly without divine intervention, which completely baffles me. I&#39;ve been doing this for awhile now, and i&#39;ve seen just about every argument <em>against</em> it under the sun, and they all have fallen short. Part of the frustration undoubtedly comes from this attitude I see around that people seem to think that they have unlocked all the secrets &amp; mysteries in the Bible. It&#39;s like they&#39;re saying God isn&#39;t infinite or all-knowing enough to keep certains truths hidden until the last days (for a very good reason), just as He said He would. I applaude anyone that goes searching for Truth with an open mind. You may not come to the same conclusion as I have, but at least you were willing to give it a go.</p>

<p>I should probably add a disclaimer that the sites I link to I don&#39;t necessarily agree with 100% of everything they have to say, but I agree with a lot more more than I do not, and they are the best sources of compilations of info I have found to date. (I was making my own site, but it quickly became such a massive undertaking and I don&#39;t feel that I have the time to complete it anymore. Additionally I found that others had already done similar sites, so I might as well piggyback on their work rather than re-invent the wheel on my own).</p>

<p>I agree with you that the woman standing up doesn&#39;t discount her giving labor by any means. In fact, I would venture to guess that a standing or squating birth was far more common in the old days than we think.</p>

<p>The pre-trib rapture is a very difficult study. When I started down the prophecy rabbit-hole I also did not think it added up. I didn&#39;t think there was enough support in the Bible for it, nor did I think we were &quot;worthy&quot; of escaping what is coming during the 7-year tribulation period, aka - Jacob&#39;s Trouble or Daniel&#39;s 70th week. I prayed about it, asked to be given wisdom &amp; knowledge regarding this subject, and after some time had gone by and I had looked at all different points of view on the subject I eventually gathered enough material from the Bible that I am now fully convinced that the pre-trib rapture is not only true, but it is actually the <strong>only</strong> one that fits the Word perfectly, and leaves no loose ends hanging.</p>

<p>That topic is far beyond the scope of this reply, but I would like to point out some ideas regarding it that most people do not take into consideration that you may find interesting and wish to do a deeper study on. I believe this is one of the &#39;mysteries&#39; revealed in the NT, and like most prophetic things are fore-shadowed and have direct analogies to it in the OT.</p>

<p>One of the core things to study is the 7 holy festivals from <strong>Leviticus 23</strong> and expand upon those. These provide a &quot;divine outline&quot; that is already partially fulfilled by Jesus and the conception of the Church as revealed in  the book of Acts.</p>

<p>Note that the first 4 have been fulfilled to the literal day by Jesus, and were given to the Israelites in the OT which directly fore-shadowed Jesus and what He did, in addition to the future events that are still left to fulfill. You can look this up in the Gospels and Acts and it confirms the fulfillment <strong>down to the literal day</strong> (Hebrew&#39;s/God&#39;s calendar is a roaming lunar one, NOT the roman calendar we use today)</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>- x3 SPRING FESTIVALS -</strong></p>

<p><strong>Passover</strong> - Lamb (Jesus) slain. This is the day he was crucified.</p>

<p><strong>Unleavened Bread</strong> - The 2nd day of the festival. Leaven = Sin. Bread = Body. Unleavened Bread = Sinless Body. This is the day Jesus was buried.</p>

<p><strong>Firstfruits</strong> - The 3rd day that He was resurrected on. Jesus is the &#39;firstfruit from the dead&#39;</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>- x1 EARLY SUMMER -</strong></p>

<p><strong>Pentecost</strong> - Exactly 50 days later (see Acts) the Holy Spirit descended upon the men and the church was symbolically conceived.</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>- x3 FALL FESTIVALS -</strong> <em>(these still remain, and are next to be fulfilled by Jesus)</em></p>

<p><strong>Feast of Trumpets</strong> - This one is critical and the next in-line to be fulfilled. It involved watchmen standing atop the Temple, waiting for the first sliver of the crescent moon to show indicating the beginning of this 2-day festival where the temple was opened and there was a SEVEN day celebration. The shofars (trumpets) were blown, and if you didn&#39;t get into the temple in time, the doors were shut and you were shut outside. They could know &#39;around&#39; the time this festival was, but not the exact day or hour since it is based off the visibility of the sliver of the crescent moon, not just the new moon as most of the other festivals were based off of.</p>

<p><strong>Day of Atonement</strong> - This is the only festival that was NOT a celebration. It was a very somber day, where the sins of the people would be placed symbolically on the goat from the high priest (Aaron back then). This represents the 7 year tribulation period that begins soon.</p>

<p><strong>Festival of Booths/Tabernacles</strong> - Represents the Millennium kingdom period after the tribulation. It is also recorded in Zechariah that during the millennium this specific festival will still be continued to be celebrated.</p>

<hr/>

<p>There are also other names these go by, such as the Feast of Trumpets is more commonly known today as <strong>Rosh Hashanah</strong>. This is the 7th month on the Hebrew calendar which begins their New Year (5778). Hebrew days also begin at SUNSET the previous day (begin in darkness, end in light. Even this is symbolic of the Day of the Lord and this pattern has been established since the creation of the world in Genesis)</p>

<p>This year it begins on Wed, September 20th at sunset and ends on sunset on Fri, September 22nd. The very next day, on the Sabbath, is the REV12 on September 23. Since every festival has been fulfilled to the literal day by Jesus, and the patterns he establishes do not change, I expect that the remaining 3 festivals will fulfill them exactly as well.</p>

<p>Study this greek word, understand the meaning and use behind it. It is an action verb, sudden, snatching away, catching away, caught up, etc. It is NOT the word used to describe Jesus ascension after His resurrection, this word is much more sudden and FORCEFUL. In short, it is teleportation done through the power of the Spirit. It happened to both Peter and Paul. <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/search/search.cfm?Criteria=%22caught+up%22+G726&amp;amp;t=KJV#s=s_primary_0_1">Here are some of the primary uses of it</a> (there&#39;s one missing from this list FYI).</p>

<p>Two things to note, the primary rapture verse (<strong>1 Thes 4:17</strong>) is one of the occurences, in addition to <strong>Revelation 12:5</strong>. This is a forceful snatching away to protect from the &quot;red dragon&quot; (<em>which is another topic unto itself...</em>) It&#39;s the second sign from Revelation 12. We know the first &#39;great sign&#39; occurs Sept. 23, 2017.</p>

<hr/>

<p>We are to have hope that we will be sparred from the wrath that is coming upon this world. This is fore-shadowed by events such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>Just as Lot was in Sodom. </li>
<li>Just like Noah and his family was in the Flood. </li>
<li>Just like Daniel&#39;s three friends in the furnace.</li>
<li>Just like the Hebrews were when they were lead out of Egypt on the <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+12:14&amp;amp;version=NASB">Wings of an Eagle</a></li>
<li>Enoch, the 7th from Adam was raptured to heaven without dying</li>
<li>Elijah was raptured to heaven without dying</li>
</ul>

<hr/>

<p>There are many more obscure passages that at first don&#39;t seem to directly relate to it, but as you study them you will begin to see the connections between them. Of the top of my head I can think of these:</p>

<ul>
<li>Leviticus 12 - the 7 days after giving birth to a male</li>
<li>Hebrew wedding traditional customs - the bridegroom would go get the bride and return to his Father&#39;s house. There would be a celebration for 7 days</li>
<li>Prophetically speaking the 7 days (as confirmed in Daniel by the Angel that gives him the seperation of the 70 weeks) is actually 7 years.</li>
<li>The second coming of Christ is not a mystery, we know it occurs at the end of the Tribulation when Jesus comes down onto the Mt. of Olives, splits it in two, and does battle at Armageddon (Mt. Megiddo). Note the rapture ref. in 1 Thes. specifcally points out that Jesus does NOT come back at that event, but rather He meets everyone for the first bodily resurrection IN THE AIR</li>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>if demons are real...so is God</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Pretty much this.</p>

<p>Some people make a real effort to avoid getting to this conclusion.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>Usually a theist argument goes something like this &quot;the probabilities of life as we know to exist and develop in a random events universe is so dim that is virtually impossible, there may be a cause to it&quot;</p>

<p>A multiverse counter-argument says &quot;There&#39;s an infinite number of universes, so this one happens to be one with the conditions needed to develop life as we know it&quot;</p>

<p>So they multiply the problem by an infinite number just to avoid the undesirable conclusion..</p>

<p>I am pretty sure he is stuck in the world and mentality of a teenager because that&#39;s how he has been successful. He could even be a part of the satanic abuse in Hollywood for all I know. Starting to discover a lot of the boy bands and girl solo artists are in some potentially abusive environments. Or just have deep emotional issues stemming from their experiences.  Maybe fame is a drug, he needs a fix, so he is keeping himself important somehow. Until he says something ,I can speculate all day why he isn&#39;t.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would follow that hunch. It&#39;s a dark path because you know where it leads. You and your friend are brave, bring a light. Heh I went down it a few years ago. Didn&#39;t take long to see what I needed.</p>

<p>It was actually Michael Jackson I looked into briefly. He is a lifetime study, but a few vids and you get the gyst. Mostly Goes back to the Beatles. After ww2 and all the things learned from human study began project monarch to transform culture. Music of course became the number one most influential form of hypnotic programming and indoctrinating youth. They become adults, have kids, indoctrinate them and after a few generations the world forgets who they are. What they know is from music and t..v. It is the black box of mk ultra. </p>

<p>Ill stop there and let you discover how record labels became sources to recruit talented musicians to sell their soul. And have the producers music performed by the musicians. And how the producers are luciferian masons. And how doctors are used to keep the artists persona intact. Not all musicians are m.k., though  famous ones all sold their talent to producers for a hit, and the producers are the ones connected to the industry telling them what to create. And the industry is the devil.</p>

<p>The symbolism itself is in everything now. You would be hard pressed to find a pop music cover  without eye symbolism. Or without some type of satanic encoding.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pretty much. All the biggest sell outs you can fit in one video. They all seem ridiculous. That was so saturated with eye symbolism it&#39;s disturbing. </p>

<p>Didn&#39;t notice too many more encodings except when they show that one guy from maroon 5 in his living room, they showed a glimpse of his couch and a blanket was placed and it had H H. Which is another way they encode Eyes. I I . and if you look they flash a Christ looking guy in the background for a second. Whole thing is creepy as fuck.</p>

<p>Speedometer on timberlakes car was at thirty mph. I&#39;ve seen them use speedmeters before in commercials and they are at 33 mph. Posted a few of them to r/subliminal.</p>

<p>But this is everything we see in entertainment. Masonic symbolism planted. I&#39;m sure I&#39;m missing some other references I don&#39;t know even know they are making.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are correct on all points. My buddy and I kinda think this was a desecration of Cash&#39;s memory. That Cash was against or uncooperative with these people, and this was their little grt back. Wild speculation, but we both got the same impression independently. It&#39;s funny I am really a science and logic guy. I was a chemist for 20, and now I do database stuff. But the deeper I go into this stuff, the more I feel like my intuition is the better tool.

    <div class="md"><p>I feel the same. Even though cash did play their games and had his own personal demons. The vid definitely doesn&#39;t do justice to his memory, the vid itself is more about the anti Christ. It just hit me in that scene of the maroon five guy. When they flashed the eyes or HH&#39;s, then the Christ, and he is then shown ignoring the Christ in favor of his altar which was a stereo. Highly symbolic shit when you watch what they are doing. Like you said a desecration. that are all mocking Christ. A desecration of Christ and Cash. Each one of them does some form of Christ pose. Like they are false idols.</p>

<p>Bono using the dollar sign in &quot;$inners are Saints&quot; is a direct jab at Cash. The Bono scene is full of capitalist symbolism, but the $ is Cash. Saints is spelled with a snake as the S. I think this scene was meant to Cast Cash in that light as false idol. Or prophet of the industry.</p>

<p>And I think cash wrote this song as a warning to Satanists originally, and instead they chose to use it against him when he died. Agree with your guys findings.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, and hell yea your intuition is better. But you need a balance of logic and intuition to keep from going too far in the hole either way. Don&#39;t want to end up a pure numerology and numbers type and all logic and just seeing numbers all day. And you don&#39;t want too go too far into symbolism. </p>

<p>Good that you notice this though. More than half our country doesn&#39;t. Right now people are watching t.v. and being pumped full of this shit and don&#39;t notice any of it.  I think we are quite amazing to be this perceptive to see through the programming.</p>

<p>And There are traps laid all around these guys. That&#39;s how I look at it. The more I uncover the more I seem to find. But it&#39;s also a trail that leads to them. So I can&#39;t help but follow it . Have a good night.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fuck yeah dude.  Bands like Soundgarden, Pearl Jam, Nirvana, AIC, etc. really encapsulated everything that was amazing about the eras before them and did it their own way without dumbing down their content for sales.  Nirvana would never have gotten away with a subversive anti-pop album like <em>In Utero</em> these days after the popular and cultural shift that <em>Nevermind</em> created for the music industry.  People don&#39;t realize these days that these bands were literally considered the saviors of music when they came out, just because of how absolutely manufactured and fake the pop drivel and hair metal garbage was before it.  This was authentic, legit music being created by everyday people from garages that somehow made it big, and you&#39;re pretty much never going to see anything like it again.  Hard not to agree when people say that the 90s was the last time that rock bands truly mattered on a cultural level.  The early 90s were absolutely incredible when it comes to anti-mainstream music and DIY attitudes becoming widespread.</p>

Mark always struck me as a cool guy, but I&#39;ve even heard stories where he completely snubbed people, even bands opening for them.  Apparently they are one of those bands who have a policy of &#39;no eye contact from lesser peons&#39; backstage.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s just it, this kind of thing isn&#39;t easily boiled down in a single article, or even all that effective to talk about online. </p>

<p>Going &#39;astral&#39; isn&#39;t a challenge anymore, and it&#39;s not just what people have been lead to believe from cinematic storytelling like the article in this post.  Most daydreaming is basically activating astral thought patterns, which is extremely subjective compared to objective human thinking.</p>

<p>Too many people are unable to distinguish between the two, and it creates a lot of confusion. </p>

<p>Worse, a lot of the alien stuff that talks about factions and hidden wars are a poor attempt at giving a human objective translation to subjective astral information. </p>

<p>People who believe articles like this post are in for a big shock. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s kind of it, it&#39;s dicey to talk about without some kind of solid foundation that reduces miscommunications and slows down the fantasies people are so ready to build for themselves.</p>

<p>I&#39;m going to use &#39;healing&#39; as an example because it&#39;s one of the few perspectives on this topic that attempts to give you at doing something rather than just reading articles. Disclaimer though, not all systems are equal or even honest (knowingly or not) with what they&#39;re teaching.</p>

<p>Think of it this way, in North America there are usually three levels in any healing system that deal with a progressive building of a specific skillset.  In asia, there are usually nine. This is pretty common for any openly advertised system or modality, the publicly available information in english usually stops at level three. Why? Because that&#39;s where it deals with the dream-like or astral quality of the types of visions and experiences that dovetail into the topic being discussed in this post. </p>

<p>This information isn&#39;t being withheld by any group with sinister purposes. Some systems will touch on the content of the later levels, but that depends largely on who you are learning from in person. Good teachers don&#39;t drop stuff on their students that their students aren&#39;t ready for.</p>

<p>But take this all with a grain of salt, I&#39;m not exactly a teacher myself. </p>

<p>This is a clip of <strong>Bill Clinton</strong> regurgitating that same narrative: <a href="https://youtu.be/QvcDNrKOlOM?t=2m20s">https://youtu.be/QvcDNrKOlOM?t=2m20s</a></p>

<p>&quot;...if we were visited someday, I wouldn&#39;t be surprised. I just hope that, uh, it&#39;s not like &#39;Independence Day&#39;, the movie—that it&#39;s a, you know, a conflict. It might be <strong>the only way to unite this increasing divided world of ours</strong>. They&#39;re out there, we&#39;ve had our—think of how all <strong>the differences among people on Earth would seem small</strong> if we felt <strong>threatened by a space invader</strong>. That&#39;s the whole theory of &#39;Independence Day&#39;.&quot; </p>

<p>So...he hopes that if it happens it&#39;s not like &quot;Independence Day&quot;...but at the same time, if it was, it would be good because it would unite the world? Interesting...</p>

<p>Now consider this: on June 30th, <strong>Donald Trump</strong> signed an executive order to revive the <strong>National Space Council</strong>, which was last active in 1993.</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/TAUqcBc0hYI?t=8m5s">He said</a>, &quot;<strong>Our journey into space</strong> will not only make us stronger and more prosperous but will <strong>unite us</strong> behind grand ambitions and <strong>bring us all closer together</strong>. Wouldn’t that be nice? Can you believe that <strong>space is going to do that</strong>? I thought politics would do that. Well, <strong>we&#39;re gonna have to rely on space</strong> instead.&quot;</p>

<p>Don&#39;t be a fool; don&#39;t fall for such an obvious agenda.</p>

<p>I listen to a lot of podcasts around UFO&#39;s and some big names with 20-30 years of tenure in the field are very suspicious and a little hurt by Tom&#39;s rapid rise.

    <div class="md"><p>Delonge&#39;s Podesta ties are very worrying. I don&#39;t like him. I think he&#39;s a prick, and in my opinion he has done jack shit for the disclosure movement beyond posturing and rambling. </p>

<p>VoTL has provided solid information. Some of their series of tweets have been so good I copied them into a document. The way they have tied everything together is pretty compelling and alongside Bill Cooper&#39;s work, a fairly concise picture starts to form... </p>

<p>But disclosure has already been happening for a while. Have you not been paying attention? There&#39;s been dozens of articles in the mainstream media which have acknowledged things that heretofore were thought of us &#39;theories&#39;. Recently they announced successfully teleporting photons. I mean, do people not fully &#39;get it&#39; when they see news like that? They&#39;ve just told us they can teleport shit. And anyone who has done some research knows they&#39;ve been able to do that for decades. </p>

<p>There&#39;s been all sorts of new technologies announced, various disclosures about our surrounding planets, etc. The disclosure process begins with seeding things into human consciousness, which they&#39;ve been doing for a while - just as Corey Goode said they would. Numerous predictions by Goode about how this process would play out seem to be fairly accurate thus far, and comparing his information alongside what VoTL is doing is very interesting. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve followed VoTL from basically the beginning of the series of tweets. I didn&#39;t know about it when the account lay mostly  inactive for a couple of years, or however long it was. But once they started, I tuned in. I have the page pretty much permanently open in my browser so I can stay up to date with their posts. I have felt since I first began watching it, that VoTL was definitely hooked up in some way with Corey Goode. It&#39;s the Alliance. </p>

<p>I definitely think disclosure is coming. But I also worry that it&#39;s still going to lead to the enslavement of humanity. They will weaponize it, to be sure. They will only tell us partial truth. But I think it will get to a point where, once a certain amount has been &#39;officially&#39; disclosed, the ignorant masses will be trying to find their local tin foil hat wearer to hear the rest of the story. </p>

<p>Once they put out disclosures of some information, it will be possible I think to extrapolate from there and work out what other &#39;theories&#39; are also true, that they haven&#39;t disclosed. I&#39;m not sure how they think a partial disclosure will ever work. Once people know some of the truth and that they&#39;ve been lied to for their entire lives, something&#39;s gonna give in the public. Finally they will wake up to certain facts and start questioning everything. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Depends how it happens. Depends what we&#39;re talking about. Are we talking about total take down of the Cabal and all of its tentacles ahead of disclosure by the &#39;good guys&#39;? Or are we talking about a disclosure event in which the Cabal still have control? </p>

<p>I keep seeing rumblings that the Cabal is being taken down, but real evidence of that is nowhere to be seen. The fact that the elite pedophiles in DC are still at large ALL this time later blows my mind. The globalist agendas seem to be continuing to play out as normal, even though there&#39;s supposed to be a take-down happening... 
I just see no signs to warrant belief that the Cabal are being defeated as yet. </p>

<p>So I&#39;m going to assume if disclosure happens it&#39;s still somewhat controlled and you can bet your bottom dollar that those people will only provide disclosure for the purposes of mass enslavement. I&#39;ve seen many theories that disclosure would coincide with the promulgation of a &#39;new religion&#39;, or the rolling out of the new world order under some peaceful, loving guise... </p>

<p>There&#39;s so many ways this could go. Only time will tell. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Definitely. </p>

<p>There seems to be some validity to the idea that he&#39;s coming into the presidency with some knowledge through his uncle about what Tesla was doing and, presumably, what was done with Tesla&#39;s ideas after his death. So this in itself should render him somewhat wanting to unlock what might be a family legacy that nobody has known about, which would be pretty special. If he does live up to his potential -which is not something I ever thought I would say about Donald Trump, I will admit that- then it could be a very good outcome. But there also seems to be some validity to the fact that Jared Kushner is a Zionist and possibly real part of the so-called &#39;Illuminati&#39;. I mean, if some of the rumblings are real...this is touch and go man. We can be sure of nothing but uncertainty. It&#39;s war. It&#39;s the battle between good and evil. It means that Trump was right when he said &#39;this is not just another four year election&#39;. He called it a crossroads in our civilization. (I refer of course <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYozWHBIf8g">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYozWHBIf8g</a>)
I still get chills when I listen to that speech. Very well edited together, by whoever extracted this from the full speech. Their edits were really masterful and this flows nicely. But it&#39;s chilling, because he is SUCH a character. His facial expressions, his hand gestures, and even his tonal use - he really leaps out of it, and when you listen to what he&#39;s saying, he&#39;s basically vindicating the conspiracy theorists. He&#39;s admitting the deep state, the darkness of it, and the fact that something needs to be done. He seems to pose one of the biggest threats it has ever had, and he knew this. They knew this. This explains the persecution of Donald Trump the minute he entered the race. They totally muscled out Bernie Sanders (remember when he announced the nomination he had that fresh gash on his cheek, which he hadn&#39;t had the day before?). They thought that had it. They probably rigged it in their favor. And still, Donald. When you look back it&#39;s amazing that he won on speeches like this. Because actually more people are waking up all the time. There&#39;s a lot who are resistant and locked into cognitive dissonance. But a LOT are waking up. Recent developments seem to suggest the shit is about to hit the fan. Elite child and organ trafficking will be dealt with and some of the major players taken down, perhaps? Who knows. But something&#39;s gotta give. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think higher ups in the control structure have been trying to plan how this will come to the public consciousness so that they can remain in control to the greatest extent possible as you mentioned. Perhaps Delonge is their guy for the leaks to bring about this &quot;partial disclosure&quot; narrative. Perhaps the bluebeam plans fell through and due to elements within the power structure exercising their free will and moving to the light. So it seems blue beam has evolved. Perhaps Delonge is part of the evolved controlled narrative, but even he acknowledges that he may be only spoon fed select information due to someone&#39;s agenda. </p>

<p>The fact of the matter is people are waking up and the power structure is wholly dependent on people&#39;s belief (or general lack of awareness) that what they are doing is the right thing to do, when in fact it is simply what was planned by those in power. So its possible even a carefully crafted disclosure process is not going according to plan as more and more people become aware of the hidden powers (the bloodlines and aristocratic lines) and their methods of control (levers in the banking, entertainment, media, health, religion and science sectors plus control over secret societies, criminal organizations, and intelligence agencies). This awareness is accelerating the dissolution of the control structures which continues to remove control of the official narratives in ways that undermine the entire power structure. </p>

<p>Assuming the trend of people realizing these mechanisms continues, their best bet is to take advantage of impending Earth changes and potential natural disasters to bring out bits of technology to use as a helping hand lending trust while uniting the worlds governments in an effort to mitigate effects of the impending global crises. After this is completed, if left unchecked, it might be possible to gain control over the major portion of the populace through such a unified government via financial and technological control.</p>

<p>The issue is enough people have woken up to these control methods that there might be no going back to the state of slumber we were in only a few decades ago. We just have to be wary when the major governments come together to save us with new technology or whatever the case may be. Its possible that Goode, Wilcock, COBRA, VOTL, etc are all part of the &quot;long con&quot; blue beam (perhaps unwittingly) and that the release of these hidden technologies ultimately means enslavement of the human race. This is why its critical that we raise our personal awareness through meditation, self reflection, healthy eating, and spiritual practice so that when the critical moment occurs we are able to discern and ally with those that have our best interests at heart and reject the control of the dark influences. I&#39;m not saying these people are definitely compromised, I&#39;m just saying always read and use discernment - and realize that only through your own actions can you ultimately transcend the problems that plague our current condition.</p>

<p>Another thing is to stay positive and visualize a more loving world. Every single person has a huge potential influence on how things play out in this critical time. And remember that things are not black and white; just because it may seem that someone is working for the dark, it could be that they have good intentions and are only being deceived and just a few kind words to them or a few well placed conversations could wake them up to the reality of the situation, severely undermining the dark&#39;s plans. The reason the dark has been so successful in controlling the Earth is because most people are mostly selfish, with some unselfish parts in them, which allow the truly selfish to manipulate the population more easily. However, as this majority of the population (who ultimately have good intentions and believe in humanity) becomes more aware of the virtue of helping others, the minority of those that are completely turned to evil will find the populace more and more difficult to control. You positive actions have an echo effect and will transmit throughout the population. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think alot of that is due to the increasing toxicity in our environment (food, water, air) and the increasing electromagnetic pollution all around us (wifi, cellular networks, HVAC, &quot;smart meters&quot;). It is possible to protect yourself from these effects by filtering your water, eating organic local produce, turning off devices when they aren&#39;t needed, turning off your wifi at night, etc while continuously healing yourself via internal energy techniques. These include meditation, yoga, tai-chi, chi-kung (or qi-gong), and others. </p>

<p>Few people do the work to reduce the toxins in their environment because they don&#39;t see the causal relationship between their consumption and daily activities and the stressors in their life. Even fewer people realize you can actively maintain health and vitality using internal energy practice because most people don&#39;t realize you can consciously manipulate your autonomic nervous system with regular practice - allowing the electromagnetic fields in your body to establish a resonance with the electromagnetic field of the Earth and beyond. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well said.  All of it.  </p>

<p>Now, this will sound crazy: This is the Great War between God (the creator) and the Devil (the created,) and other fallen angels.  We are all waking up everyday in a war zone.  You just don&#39;t know it.  The Devil(s) occupy bodies/minds and play out complex narratives that deceive and intend to drive their targets to insanity.  Men, prayed upon like this, have taken up and joined with them in all different roles of government, the private sector, and underground.  The fallen angels have telepathic abilities, and with so much technology it is easy to hide the ability.  Over the centuries, through extortion, theft, murder, blackmail, war, terrorist attacks, and any other means necessary they have complete control of the monetary system.  The signs and symbolism over the centuries has remained relatively constant because the enemy has been constant.  Their god is money because it allows them to control/trick men.</p>

<p>If you believe what I said, you might feel despair.  But don&#39;t lose hope! The Devil has already lost and that is why they are so mad.  This is their prison (for now,) and they have gone centuries without a fair fight.  There is balance here now.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look at Tom DeLong&#39;s square and compass symbol on his guitar. There are pictures of him wearing the masonic apron with fellow masons. He is a stonemason. The guy used to be anti military industrial complex as a young man. Now he is saying the government is the good guy and their nuclear stockpile is to protect us from aliens. Weird... The strange thing is he does have serious connections. But he is also cashing in on all of this with his company. But still others like Cameron have said he has info, though he is being guided. Big names like Smith and Vallee are connected.</p>

<p>Weird things are happening. Weird things are happening in the pedogate investigation. This stuff is real. SRA is real. Strange and evil things are afoot. These beings are spiritual. Funny because Vallee discusses how Alien phenomenon is not just &quot;physical&quot;, but even more than that. He might say trans-dimensional. You take this with things like bluebeam, and the warnings of scriptures of the great apostasy and signs that could fool even possibly the very elect. We are living in a weird time. Something is happening. I think Jesus is coming soon. Before he comes though, very awful, powerful, and terrifying things are going to occur. Dark things are bubbling up.</p>

<p>Really guys, please listen to the words of Jesus. Pray to him. He did die on the cross for the sins of the world, and is our only hope. From everything I have ever learned of the &quot;high strange&quot;, I can say that it is leading to a climax. We are fighting against principalities and powers.</p>

<p>With the satanic holidays and rituals, with the messy and suspicious suicides of 2 big names in Hollywood and their connections to pedophilia and child sex trafficking... with September 23 being 33 days away from the Bohemian Satanic meeting... </p>

<p>I feel like it is coming this year. I&#39;ve always felt like we were being subconsiously programmed to soften the blow of extra-terrestrial life being introduced to us - just because of all of the media and television and pop culture..</p>

<p>What if they are finally ready and they believe that our consciousness has reached the point of being able to process such an event?</p>

<p>Fine. One more. He&#39;s been pardoned because he&#39;s elbow deep w/ Clinton&#39;s, Obama and both &quot;establishment&quot; parties. He ran a lot of back door channels w/ lots of missing money to account for (personal money too) that he&#39;d never avoid serving time for, if ever investigated. He was trapped a long time ago, many, against his will. His vengeance has been earned and his pardon is retribution to decades of corruption. Trump was VERY CAREFUL who he selected to pull from the Obama trenches.</p>

<p>Mueller being the one to bring this home is the absolute best retaliatory ass fuck to the establishment. I will also say this, it&#39;s intended as a sign and smoke signal for those in the establishment, still unwillingly riding the coat tails of McCain, Pelosi, Graham, Schumer, etc. because they&#39;re living in fear. Mueller proves Trump know who the real criminals are. You&#39;re going to watch congress unite and really behind Teump with the establishment&#39;s collapse because they will see the swamp can&#39;t threaten them or blackmail anymore. I really can&#39;t say anything else. Just have faith.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You say you have followed VoTL since the beginning. Have you read all 6,000+ of his tweets? I tried to read some but his tweets are too absurd and sound like the ravings of madman or someone on drugs. I&#39;m open minded but a lot of the things he tweets is too far at the deep end of the pool of believably.</p>

<p>Also, there are some elements of his tweets that made me think of &quot;Commander Z&quot; (<a href="https://twitter.com/timewave666">https://twitter.com/timewave666</a>). The problem I have with these people is the really weird claims they&#39;re making</p>

<p>PLAUSIBLE (Not too far fetched)</p>

<ul>
<li>possible nuclear war</li>
<li>possible World War III</li>
<li>underground bases</li>
<li>depopulation agenda</li>
<li>huge city below Moscow, Russia</li>
<li>Russia-China-NATO alliance</li>
<li>agenda to control population by making immoral values the social norm</li>
</ul>

<p>ABSURD</p>

<ul>
<li>evil aliens trying to take over governments/Earth</li>
<li>VoTL calls these aliens &quot;Ashkenazi/fake Jews&quot; who did the holocaust, hijacked Judaism and is trying to rule the world</li>
<li>lunar moon bases already operational</li>
<li>VoTL says one lunar base was destroyed by the Soviets in 1979</li>
<li>the aliens are cloning world leaders (takes a few years)</li>
<li>aliens possess those cloned bodies</li>
<li>blood oath / selling of human souls (something about 3rd and 4th dimensions)</li>
</ul>

<p>I guess they would argue they throw in some absurdities to throw people off. In that case, what is their true messages weaved within the absurd messages? They keep pushing the idea that August to November 2017 is when there will be a noticeable financial event with the stock market and banks failing, that high government officials will start taking leave by October 2017, I think both had stated their dislike of Trump even calling him a traitor.</p>

<p>The message is pretty much fear mongering and LARPing. At this point I pretty much don&#39;t believe in the alien story anymore.</p>

<p>Look up <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_M._Greer">Steven Greer</a>, the &quot;Disclosure Project&quot; started in 1993. It&#39;s been 24 years with nothing to show for it. And now we are to believe aliens are going to reveal themselves again? Their work only further pushes people into disbelieving it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fuck yeah dude.  Bands like Soundgarden, Pearl Jam, Nirvana, AIC, etc. really encapsulated everything that was amazing about the eras before them and did it their own way without dumbing down their content for sales.  Nirvana would never have gotten away with a subversive anti-pop album like <em>In Utero</em> these days after the popular and cultural shift that <em>Nevermind</em> created for the music industry.  People don&#39;t realize these days that these bands were literally considered the saviors of music when they came out, just because of how absolutely manufactured and fake the pop drivel and hair metal garbage was before it.  This was authentic, legit music being created by everyday people from garages that somehow made it big, and you&#39;re pretty much never going to see anything like it again.  Hard not to agree when people say that the 90s was the last time that rock bands truly mattered on a cultural level.  The early 90s were absolutely incredible when it comes to anti-mainstream music and DIY attitudes becoming widespread.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s kind of it, it&#39;s dicey to talk about without some kind of solid foundation that reduces miscommunications and slows down the fantasies people are so ready to build for themselves.</p>

<p>I&#39;m going to use &#39;healing&#39; as an example because it&#39;s one of the few perspectives on this topic that attempts to give you at doing something rather than just reading articles. Disclaimer though, not all systems are equal or even honest (knowingly or not) with what they&#39;re teaching.</p>

<p>Think of it this way, in North America there are usually three levels in any healing system that deal with a progressive building of a specific skillset.  In asia, there are usually nine. This is pretty common for any openly advertised system or modality, the publicly available information in english usually stops at level three. Why? Because that&#39;s where it deals with the dream-like or astral quality of the types of visions and experiences that dovetail into the topic being discussed in this post. </p>

<p>This information isn&#39;t being withheld by any group with sinister purposes. Some systems will touch on the content of the later levels, but that depends largely on who you are learning from in person. Good teachers don&#39;t drop stuff on their students that their students aren&#39;t ready for.</p>

<p>But take this all with a grain of salt, I&#39;m not exactly a teacher myself. </p>
