<p>You guys have been asking such insightful and pertinent questions on my <strong>AMA</strong> this week (as opposed to the <strong>IM</strong>pertinent ones I often get! :) I’ve decided to give away <strong>two signed books</strong> — <em>Dee-Coding Shakespeare</em> and <em>BARDCODE: The Missing ‘i’</em>.</p>

<hr/>

<p>There are <strong>TWO MYSTERIES</strong> surrounding Shakespeare&#39;s Sonnets.</p>

<p><strong>MYSTERY #1</strong></p>

<p>The world’s most famous collection of love poems was first published in 1609 in quarto form. (So named because the printed sheet off the press was folded into four.) The slim, 80 page booklet is known today simply as <strong>Q</strong>.</p>

<p>There are only thirteen extant copies, most in clean, un-thumbed condition. They were obviously not devoured by a hungry audience as were Shakespeare&#39;s previous poetic offerings, <em>Venus and Adonis</em> and <em>The Rape of Lucrece</em>, which were still going strong after seventeen years, having burned through sixteen sell-out printings by the time the <em>Sonnets</em> came out. In stark contrast there’s no solid proof that <strong>Q</strong> sold even a single copy. It was met with almost complete silence, hardly a soul mentioning it for the next hundred years. It’s one of the biggest mysteries in publishing history.</p>

<p><strong>WHAT’S YOUR THEORY?</strong>…  as to why the entire print run of a hotly-anticipated book of poems by the most famous writer in town apparently disappeared without a trace, only to surface one or two copies at a time, a century or more later, hidden away in dusty libraries of long-forgotten aristocrats?</p>

<p>The person with the best theory to explain Mystery #1 will receive:
 <strong>a signed copy</strong> of <em>Dee-Coding Shakespeare</em>. </p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>MYSTERY #2</strong></p>

<p>This second mystery is hardly ever mentioned by Stratfordians (those who peddle the orthodox story of an untraveled, uneducated Stratford man being the great author). <a href="http://imgur.com/a/ubEkF"><strong>TWO</strong></a> different versions of the Sonnets title page were printed. </p>

<p>The <em>Aspley</em>, (4 extant copies), which contains all the hidden sacred geometry we’ve been talking about. And the <em>Wright</em>, (7 extant copies), which contains NOTHING! No right triangles. No circle. No pyramid coordinates. (Two other copies exist but are missing their title pages.) Everything else within both versions of the quarto — the dedication, the sonnets themselves, and the final, curiously added poem, <em>A Lover&#39;s Complaint</em>— are essentially identical in each. <a href="http://imgur.com/a/hHEQl">COMPARE</a></p>

<p><strong>WHAT’S YOUR THEORY?</strong>…  as to why two separate title pages were printed? One hiding a stunningly brilliant cryptographic masterpiece — the other, absolutely ordinary and inconsequential.</p>

<p>The person with the best theory to explain Mystery #2 will receive:
 <strong>a signed copy</strong> of <em>BARDCODE: The Missing ‘i’</em>. (Due out December, 2017).</p>

<hr/>

<p>Good luck, everyone!</p>

The Wright printed with intent to be given to those that this sort of hidden data would not want to have.  Example, if the play was held today in America, and suspicious looking men in black bought tickets - give them the simple version.  </p>

<p>Mystery #2
Aspley versions printed later, made to look legit to copy the original Wright, but with hidden sacred geometry so as to keep the information moving forward.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>On #2, if Dee&#39;s intention was to preserve this hidden knowledge then it would be crucial to do so in the first print run, to ensure the distribution reached a select few trusted custodians above all else. One might expect therefore that the print run also be limited to meet that specific requirement; no more and no less.</p>

<p>The &quot;trusted custodian&quot; element gets more weighty when one considers that Aspley was also a freeman (full member) of the Worshipful Company of Stationers and Newspaper Makers by the time the Sonnets were printed; there may be a connection between this company and the secret societies of the time.</p>

<p>The second print run would then have served a couple of purposes; to obfuscate the first print run, and more than likely to satisfy demand for the Sonnets themselves.</p>

<p>Do any extant copies have a chain of custody that reveals any such clues? The two copies with missing title pages seem particularly worthy of investigation, given that the title page is the &quot;smoking gun.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Regarding both mysteries, the printing organization is the common denominator. Not to say that it&#39;s the same printer in both situations, but to simply point out that intelligent men would have immediately recognized the power attached to the ability to print.</p>

<p>As for mystery #1. </p>

<p>We know the printing of Q occurred. </p>

<p>We know that external references to the printing are pretty much nonexistent regarding it&#39;s printing at the time &quot;of the printing&quot;.</p>

<p>We know that copies of Q start to surface later in the timeline.</p>

<p>This suggests that the copies found their way to &quot;secure and stable&quot; residences. Places where the copy was stored with care assuring it&#39;s continued existence.</p>

<p>This in turn suggests quite obviously that these were the residences of successful men/women. Only they would be able to provide such steadfast care-taking of the copy.</p>

<p>Put all of this together and it suggests that this particular printing had a &quot;distribution list&quot; that was adhered to.</p>

<p>Considering the cryptography that has been involved with the situation as a whole, I would have to assume the Q was part of a &quot;book cipher&quot; operation.</p>

<p>If you&#39;ve tracked the surfacing of any of the existent copies to their source, this may give you a staring point to put together at least some of the members of this operation as a way to confirm this theory.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For Mystery #2:</p>

<p>I really feel like the answer to this is fairly simple. It was obviously important for them to keep this preserved so the &quot;plain&quot; copy was meant to get it out to the masses without the code. Since so much was at risk they wanted to ensure they were long gone before anyone decoded it so it would truly be a gift to the future. If decoded too early it would have likely been destroyed and then remained hidden forever. This would <strong><em>ruin</em></strong> all the beautiful precision that was so carefully and purposely placed. Basically, it would&#39;ve been all for nothing.</p>

<p>Having such a sleight variant (to the blind naked eye) has a low chance of raising any eyebrows. This is exactly what they wanted, and why it&#39;s taken so long for us to get to this point. The plan and execution was a brilliant success. So much so that we get the pleasure of watching it all unfold hundreds of years later.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As far as mystery #2 goes:</p>

<p>I reject your notion that the Wright page is absolutely ordinary and inconsequential. I believe there to be encoded &quot;truth&quot; behind this page as well - but perhaps different and/or MUCH more difficult to uncover...</p>

<p>I&#39;ll start with questioning the significance of the author&#39;s name shift as illustrated here:</p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/a/WXO9M">http://imgur.com/a/WXO9M</a></p>

<p>Perhaps it&#39;s meant to center everything on the page....I see this logic, but I&#39;d like to point out the &quot;two lines&quot; could be shifted &quot;up&quot; along with the printers info on the wright copy to maintain the same header and footer margins as the Aspley version. I don&#39;t see the importance of maintaining the lines ...&quot;across&quot; the pages if there is nothing to be found in the Wright version.</p>

<p>I&#39;d also like to point your attention to the heading illustration. There are two rabbits - one white and one black - suggesting duality...</p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/a/5Qcnr">http://imgur.com/a/5Qcnr</a></p>

<p>Perhaps this is a printing artifact, but it appears in the aspley version as well...</p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/a/Tm0L9">http://imgur.com/a/Tm0L9</a></p>

<p>Finally - maintaining proportion on the wright copy with respect to the printer&#39;s information produces interesting results. Here are something I&#39;ve been playing around with...</p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/a/HS8z1">http://imgur.com/a/HS8z1</a></p>

<p>Vesica Pisces, seed of life, the lune of hippocrates(maybe hidden solution...*doubtful- hah!) - and some odd...familiar sigils that I can&#39;t remember.</p>

<p>Anywho - these show up specifically in proportion with the circle I created noticing the circular &quot;form&quot; of the publisher&#39;s information on the Wright version. </p>

<p>I understand this is heavy in speculation - but I&#39;d also like one to consider both scenarios:</p>

<p>One page with apparent hidden knowledge and...some sort of reasoning behind releasing a &quot;plain&quot; version...</p>

<p>or</p>

<p>Duality and hidden knowledge in both versions - as pointed out via the header illustration - I assume something that would be favored  by the likes of John Dee and ...Eed Nhoj.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mystery #1 : It seems the book Q was simply an alchemical type of text, not meant for wide distribution, although with an understanding that it would eventually find it&#39;s way to the public. My theory is that the book itself served as more of a textbook for a select few. ALSO, it&#39;s possible that the &#39;Aspley&#39; and &#39;Wright&#39; were not actual people and so Q was never widely disseminated to hide and obscure this. (More on this idea follows)</p>

<p>Mystery #2:
The two title pages, along with sonnets 153 and 154, indicate a duality, more properly understood as the &quot;two sides of the same coin,&quot;  which is a central thematic throughout Q. This duality has to do with the very depths of being, with the capacity to describe and encompass with language AND our complete inability to FULLY describe and encompass with language. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s start with the Aspley version. Here we find the sacred Geometry. The name &#39;Aspley&#39; is actually a clue. &#39;Asp&#39; is a reference to the Egyptian Cobra which is symbolic as the third eye or awakened Uraeus Energy, otherwise known as kundalini. For Brevity&#39;s sake, we can view this as the vital force, the essential connection to higher spirituality. (A further argument can be made, but it&#39;s beyond the scope here.)   </p>

<p>Then we have the &#39;Ley,&#39; as in Ley Lines, which again is an esoteric concept, but doing some research you can see how prehistoric structures, such as the Great Pyramids, Stone Hedge, Easter Island etc fall on these ley lines.   Also, a definition from dictionary.com defines &#39;ley&#39; as &quot;a line joining two prominent points in the landscape, thought to be the line of a prehistoric track&quot;  This is a clue to look for the sacred geometry, which then points back to the Great Pyramid. </p>

<p>I believe the First Names in the two copies &quot;William&quot; and &quot;John&quot; are merely naming the two who had a hand in all this, Shakespeare and Dee, and furthermore may be indicating the function or role that each had in the creation of this literature.  </p>

<p>Now, the &quot;Wright&quot; version is not inconsequential, but rather much more straight forward in it&#39;s meaning. A &#39;Wright&#39; is one who creates, who builds, such as a playwright or a shipwright. The title page states, &quot;to be sold by John Wright, dwelling at Christ Church Gate.&quot;   So, the Wright, the builder, the craftsman as it were, lives at the Gate of the Church of Christ. Lives at the Entrance to Divinity. Builds and Creates a portal to the Christ Consciousness.  </p>

<p>Again, a lot of esoteric, mystery school like extrapolation here, but what you have between the two different title pages is one that states: </p>

<p>A craftsmanship, a building (builder?) to the divine (Wright version)</p>

<p>and</p>

<p>A physical map of the sacred (Aspley)</p>

<p>I also could see Wright being &#39;the idea, the essence, where we can go to the gate, but maybe cannot gain physical, linguistic understanding,&#39; while Aspley is &#39;here&#39;s our sacred numbers, relations, and Kundalini energy, and the Pyramids.&quot;</p>

<p>I also wondered why the work was called Q (my very, very brief research turned up nothing). So I turned to the 17th sonnet, Q being the 17th letter. (I did see the pyramid structure being 17x17x17 as well!)</p>

<p>This is getting long so I will keep from breaking it all down, but I think the 17th sonnet is a major clue, even to the fact of the the hidden sacred geometry. I&#39;ll post the 17th sonnet here:</p>

<p>Who will believe my verse in time to come,
If it were filled with your most high deserts?
Though yet heaven knows it is but as a tomb
Which hides your life, and shows not half your parts.
If I could write the beauty of your eyes,
And in fresh numbers number all your graces,
The age to come would say &#39;This poet lies;
Such heavenly touches ne&#39;er touched earthly faces.&#39;
So should my papers, yellowed with their age,
Be scorned, like old men of less truth than tongue,
And your true rights be termed a poet&#39;s rage
And stretched metre of an antique song:
   But were some child of yours alive that time,
   You should live twice, in it, and in my rhyme.</p>

<p>High deserts, but as a tomb (great pyramid).... numbers number ( a nod to sacred geometry) heavenly touches ne&#39;er touched earthly face (the duality I spoke of earlier) If I could write the beauty of your eyes (the inability to fully encompass with language) You should live twice, in it, and in my rhyme (indicates Time and timelessness). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry Alan reddit formatting messed me up. I wanted to try to explain mystery number 2. But I&#39;m standing by that you had to have both books to know what the geometry in the cover is. And I will also say I never read much Shakespeare. But I will say real quick that reading this poem is like I imagine a women that is being raped could feel like when her body likes it even though she knows she is being raped. The little connections he impresses on your mind with, from what I remember, he calls &#39;word similes&#39;. For me the double talk combined with these &#39;pregnant&#39; words makes me feel dirty. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>And often reading what <del>contents</del> constants it bears;
As often shrieking undistinguish&#39;d woe,
In clamours of all size, both high and low.</p>

<p>A thousand favours from a maund she drew
Of amber, crystal, and of beaded jet,
Which one by one she in a river threw,
Upon whose weeping margent she was set;
Like usury, applying wet to wet,
Or monarch&#39;s hands that let not bounty fall
Where want cries some, but where excess begs all.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t the math very well but is this describing eulor&#39;s constant e? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#39;Father,&#39; she says, &#39;though in me you behold
The injury of many a blasting hour,
Let it not tell your judgment I am old;
Not age, but sorrow, over me hath power:
I might as yet have been a spreading flower,
Fresh to myself, If I had self-applied
Love to myself and to no love beside.
&#39;But, woe is me! too early I attended
A youthful suit--it was to gain my grace--
Of one by nature&#39;s outwards so commended,
That maidens&#39; eyes stuck over all his face:
Love lack&#39;d a dwelling, and made him her place;
And when in his fair parts she did abide,
She was new lodged and newly deified.
&#39;His browny locks did hang in crooked curls;
And every light occasion of the wind
Upon his lips their silken parcels hurls.
What&#39;s sweet to do, to do will aptly find:
Each eye that saw him did enchant the mind,
For on his visage was in little drawn
What largeness thinks in Paradise was sawn.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Golden section, phi? &#39;Browny locks&#39;? Godly locks? </p>

<p>I could go on but I am already Preganant and in the shower. So the angles are given with the first cover and A lover&#39;s complaint is a compliment by giving the context of these angles. That&#39;s my theory and I&#39;m sticking to it. </p>

<p>Two responses were, in my opinion, so close to what I perceive the truth to be, as to warrant a prize each. </p>

<p>So I shall be sending *<em>TWO signed copies</em> of <em>Dee-Coding Shakespeare</em> asap to:</p>

<p>and</p>

<p><strong>zombie_dave</strong></p>

<p>If both of you will write me personally (<a href="mailto:alan@ToBeOrNotToBe.org">alan@ToBeOrNotToBe.org</a>) I’ll comment further on why your theories appealed to me.
Also, of course, send me your physical addresses so I can send the books!</p>

<p>Three responses were, in my opinion, so close to what I perceive the truth to be, as to warrant a prize each. </p>

<p>So I shall be sending <strong>THREE</strong> signed copies of <em>BARCODE: The Missing ‘i’</em> (when it comes out in December, 2017) to:</p>

<p>(Felix got his answer in almost immediately after the contest was posted. 11am/07/27 - Well Done!)</p>

and</p>

<p>If all three of you will write to me personally (<a href="mailto:alan@ToBeOrNotToBe.org">alan@ToBeOrNotToBe.org</a>) I’ll comment further on why your theories, though similar to others, had variances that are appealing to me.
Also, of course, send me your physical addresses so I can send the books when they come out!</p>
