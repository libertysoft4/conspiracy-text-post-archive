        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The entire purpose of the Federal reserve is to vacuum up as much money from the American economy as possible overtime until the people are so desperate to survive that they beg the Cabal to save them. The cabal will then ask for global power for sinister reasons. </p>

<p>The payroll tax is pretty much what pays off the Federal Reserve. This means, about 30% of all employee work is taxed and dropped in the Rothschild piggy bank for safe keeping plus he can use that money like a slave whip to hire millions of people who are so desperate for money that they will work against humanity for it. He basically pays people to do his evil deeds with his right hand and continues to extract that money back into his pockets with his left hand through the Federal Reserve. </p>

<p>Rothschild also has the IRS in his pocket. The IRS is a private organization that was strictly built to be the tax collection enforcers of Rothschild. Rothschild gave them all kinds of power to be able to imprison, fine, and destroy anyone who doesn&#39;t fall in line with this crime against America and humanity. </p>

<p>The funniest part of all this is that, after all the damage, the Federal Reserve sits like a tumor on America to this day. </p>

<p>They made it look and sound like a government building too:</p>

<p><a href="https://img.rt.com/files/oldfiles/usa/federal-reserve-anonymous-oplastresort-585/reserve-building-federal.si.jpg">https://img.rt.com/files/oldfiles/usa/federal-reserve-anonymous-oplastresort-585/reserve-building-federal.si.jpg</a></p>

<p>This organization caused the Great Depression and every single Recession since. It has drained America from a place that causes dreams to come true to a place that causes nightmares for all. </p>

<p>How the fuck has this place not been bulldozed down yet? Why aren&#39;t there oceans of Americas swarming this place with massive protests to force the worlds attention on this TUMOR? </p>

<p>Its time to pull a South Korea and run some million man marches through DC and around this Federal Reserve tumor for months relentlessly until we are heard or else these clowns will continue to ignore us. They are shameless. Look at all these scandals and treasonous crimes that have surfaced yet the cabal walks around DC like nothing happened since the &quot;dumb shleper goy never defend themselves.&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, so the Fed only controls the lending of money to and by banks, and to an declining extent, the supply of money. They have nothing to do with taxation... Nothing.</p>

<p>Money supply has GREATLY increased, and has not been vacuumed up as you stated. </p>

<p>You cite no evidence for the ridiculous notion that the Fed is controlled by the Rothschild family. If its controlled by anyone it is China, whose sequestered dollar holdings are a real and demonstrable problem.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I definitely don&#39;t agree with the scary music vibe. </p>

<p>You can explain away anything you want, it doesn&#39;t change reality.</p>

<p>When the fed was created our purchasing power eroded.</p>

<p>We had a bottomless credit machine to fund any and every project we could possibly want. There&#39;s always money for wars, but we can&#39;t feed the poor. </p>

<p>Our money has lost its purchasing power. Our money isn&#39;t backed by anything.</p>

<p>It&#39;s my understanding that the monetary policy deliberations that they go through have no oversight from the GAO.</p>

<p>The fed audits itself in many ways but nothing in the way that&#39;s needed. It&#39;s a private entity functioniing as the main regulating body of the flow of funds around this country. On a whim it can make or break markets with a small meeting. If Janet Yellen sneezes markets can panic.</p>

<p>It&#39;s too much power in a centralized location and it only stands to enable a giant credit card that continues to rob the population of real wealth and value via inflation. </p>

<p>25 cents used to feed one person for a week. Purchasing power went down, wages did not rise to meet this change.</p>

<p>Our money is just a farce. It really is.</p>

<p>The fear of deflation while &quot;inflation is a necessary evil&quot; is a load of bunk they sold us.  It&#39;s only necessary for a never ending cycle of war that his elastic fiat currency can perpetuate because the money is based on faith and not any tangible good.</p>

<p>Greenspan himself used fo write about the importance of the gold standard. That is until he got hired to work the scam. Dr. Paul talks about his strange change and its very interesting.</p>

<p>[Gold and Economic Freedom</p>

<p>by Alan Greenspan](<a href="http://constitution.org/mon/greenspan_gold.htm">http://constitution.org/mon/greenspan_gold.htm</a>)</p>

<p>The intro paragraph:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>An almost hysterical antagonism toward the gold standard is one issue which unites statists of all persuasions. They seem to sense — perhaps more clearly and subtly than many consistent defenders of laissez-faire — that gold and economic freedom are inseparable, that the gold standard is an instrument of laissez-faire and that each implies and requires the other.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Fed is independent, but wholly accountable to Congress, its board of governors, and requiring of the cooperation of the Treasury. I&#39;m not defending increased money supply because I&#39;m opposed to it. I would point out that your dollar buys more volume, productivity and experience of product or service than it did when the US was on the gold standard. Purchasing power may have declined, but deflation and productivity increased offsetting some of the pain.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are wrong and I will explain why. Your dollars are worth relatively less because the US Treasury has amassed an over 100pct debt to GDP ratio, and because states have unfunded  liabilities far in excess of their means as well. These deficits are in parts bad public policy, politics, demographics, private market over leveraging, and over consumption in the US. To a degree it&#39;s also impacted by currency manipulation in Asia. In simple terms... trillions in liquidity has been created by parties other than the Fed and the Fed has been forced, by legislative mandate, to carry much of this debt on its balance sheet, printing money to buy it. In still other terms, the Fed is the fat guy eating everyone&#39;s leftovers at the table... but not by choice.</p>

<p>You cite no evidence for the ridiculous notion that the Fed is controlled by the Rothschild family.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, it is controlled by &quot;Rothschild and Friends&quot; - a group of Jewish families that have long-time  banking dynasties, and work cooperatively to forward their mutual interests. </p>

<p>Collectively, these are often referred to as &quot;the Rothschilds&quot;, but other families include the Warburgs, Schiffs, Medicis and others. </p>

<p>Regarding the Federal Reserve, here&#39;s a nice little article from the <strong><em>FORWARD</em></strong> magazine.</p>

<p>Mind you, the article is in a Jewish publication, written BY a Jewish author and intended for a Jewish audience - so naturally these folks are <strong><em>praising</em></strong> the Fed - and BRAGGING that it is &quot;their baby&quot;.</p>

A government entity should be in charge of printing money and monetary policy. Also money should be backed by real assets such as gold, debt is not a sustainable method to create value especially when it is increasing exponentially. At some point the country will become insolvent because it will not be able to produce enough goods and services to cover the interest payments. The value of money is literally based on a belief that it is valuable, which could crumble at any moment.

<p>The Bureau of Engraving and Printing (BEP) is a government agency within the United States Department of the Treasury that designs and produces a variety of security products for the United States government, most notable of which is Federal Reserve Notes (paper money) <strong>bold</strong>for the Federal Reserve, the nation&#39;s central bank.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He said that the fed prints money, but that is not true because a non affiliated bureau does. My point is completely accurate. To say that anyone just &quot;prints new money&quot; is dumbing it down too much as well, creating new money is not that simple. The majority of money printed in the US is to replace old currency, not to add additional currency into the economy. </p>

<p>BEP actually does the printing, but the notes are owned by the Fed. The point is it doesn&#39;t matter who actually makes the paper note. What matters is the owner of the finished product.</p>

<p>Something that is rare can be valuable, but generally only in a niche community who values collecting it as increasing their enjoyment of life. </p>

<p>Think about it. Every new service someone performs, or every new good that someone creates, adds the amount of raw value to the overall economy. With how fast the population is growing, and how much faster and easier it&#39;s becoming to manufacture goods and provide services, having all of your currency backed on a fixed amount of shiny metal is an insane idea.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Gold and Silver have been valued as currency since the beginning of time. </p>

<p>On Earth, gold and silver are considered precious metals due to the FINITE nature of both mined and in-ground quantity. Same with Bitcoin although there are multiple crypto currencies. </p>

<p>Once the quantities of those precious metals are mined out and bought up, there will be no more, only buying from someone who has some to sale. </p>

<p>Debt-based Fiat currencies are based only on what the printer of said currencies claims it to be. </p>

<p>The debt-based Fiat can be printed infinitely (assuming that the resources required are sustainable) while using inflation/devaluation/taxation to manipulate its value over time as desired by those printing it. </p>

<p>Hence why gold and Silver have always been currency and always will.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Then what happens when the economy gets sufficiently large and we run out of gold and silver? Who&#39;s going to be responsible for devaluing the currency? Are we going to have to re-mint the coins we have with lower gold contents in order to have more coins? Or is someone going to have to declare that the coins are now worth more, and by how much?</p>

<p>The currency is irrelevant, that&#39;s what you&#39;re not getting. Dollar bills are just tokens of credit. All money has ever been is a system of credit and debt, circulating around the community. When you produce something valuable, you are issued credit for it, which equals debt against the person issuing it. That&#39;s what money has always been, forever. The tokens you get are just there for to represent how much credit you have, so that it&#39;s easier for someone else to believe how much you&#39;re able to spend. What we make the currency out of is not important, as long as there are measures in place to prevent counterfeit.</p>

<p>Fiat currency cannot be printed infinitely without collapsing the economy. The amount of dollars in existence need to correspond with the amount of value in the economy. And not only that, but <strong>over 90% of the world&#39;s money is not physical.</strong> </p>

<p>The fact that only about 8% of the money in the world is actual printed physical money should tell you how irrelevant it is what we print the money onto. We can print it onto gold, or diamonds, or silk, or ivory, or whatever. It doesn&#39;t matter, as long as the supply is controlled. </p>

<p>Even when gold coins were the norm, they were still minted with official government iconography, and a gold coin was always worth more than it&#39;s weight in gold (except for occasional recessions).</p>

<p>Nobody who studies the economy advocates for a gold standard. There&#39;s a reason we abolished it.</p>

Mention that the Federal reserve is neither Federal nor a Reserve and most people will consider you some kind of a wing-nut and a prime candidate for a tin-foil hat. Its true purpose remains as shrouded in deception as its origins. JFK&#39;s intention to put an end to this scam, IMO, was the prime motive for his assassination. Granted, there were other reasons such as pulling US troops out of Vietnam and his opposition to the Israeli nuclear program but quite simply, he made more enemies than any man can put to good purpose. Most of these enemies were jews. Let&#39;s not forget that Meyer Lansky, a jew and an Israeli hero, was the head of organized crime in the US.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ugh, why don&#39;t you learn how the Federal Reserve <em>actually works</em> before marching in the street. No, the IRS is not a private organization. It is part of the United States Department of the Treasury.</p>

<p>Because the Federal Reserve owns a portion of the national debt (Treasury bonds), it&#39;s true that the Federal Reserve receives a portion of the interest on the bonds. That does come from taxes.</p>

<p>But the Federal Reserve gives almost all its profits to the federal government, so it <em>saves money for the government</em> when the Fed buys bonds.</p>

<p>Ever since the 2008 financial crisis, the Fed has given much more to the government than the government has paid to the Fed in interest.</p>

<p>Since the Fed&#39;s founding, it has paid the federal government over one trillion dollars.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They made it look and sound like a government building too:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah, that is a government building. The <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/">Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System</a> is a federal agency, led by seven governors who are nominated by the President of the United States and confirmed by the United States Senate.</p>

<p>The 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks are <em>not</em> part of the federal government. There is a mixture of public and private control for the regional banks. Each regional bank is a separate corporation, under the direction of a nine member board of directors. Six of the nine directors are chosen by all the member banks in that region. The remaining three are appointed by the Board of Governors (the federal agency).</p>

<p>The Rothschilds have never had anything to do with the Federal Reserve. That&#39;s a hoax.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This couldn&#39;t be farther from the truth. The fact that the Fed even makes a profit, should be an immediate red flag on your post (why should a private entity make profit of a country&#39;s money supply and not the government itself), but I&#39;ll break it down so others won&#39;t be fooled because it&#39;s actually very simple.</p>

<p>The Fed prints US currency (dollars) and LOANS said currency to the US government AT INTEREST. Repeat, the US government DOES NOT PRINT IT&#39;S OWN MONEY. That means that every US dollar that is &quot;legal tender&quot; is just an IOU back to the Fed. Every dollar that is printed is more interest capital that is pumped back into the Fed. Where does the capital to pay off that interest come from? It comes from US tax dollars. It comes from selling off US owned property to foreign organizations. Again, to summarize: Fed prints money, loans it to US government with interest, US government taxes its people to pay back the debt and sells off its hard assets, rinse, repeat until a crisis or collapse.</p>

<p>This is literally the definition of a Ponzi scheme. There will never be enough capital to pay off the debt of the US currency. It&#39;s impossible to. Tie this in with the complete fixation of LIBOR by the global banking cartel, and you literally have a situation where: 1) The Fed is getting paid through interest by the US government (through taxation and sales of physical assets) 2) The global banking cartel that makes up the Fed gets low interest dollars siphoned through each country&#39;s monetary system and then loans that money back to the citizens of its country and gets interest payment off that. They are collecting interest from numerous sources while getting back free money, and bankrupting the citizens of the country in BROAD DAYLIGHT. </p>

<p>How you can defend the most heinous organization in the entire history of this country is complete lunacy.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Well, no. The government pays interest on Treasury securities (bonds). It doesn&#39;t pay interest on Federal Reserve notes.</p>

<p>One way that the Federal Reserve increases the money supply is by buying Treasury securities. Usually the Federal Reserve owns between 10 and 20% of the Treasury securities.</p>

<p>So, when that happens, in a very loose sense, the government pays interest on that money, but the government would pay interest on the bonds whether the Fed bought them or not. When the Fed buys the Treasury bonds, they are bonds that already exist. It doesn&#39;t increase the government&#39;s debt.</p>

<p>And since most profits from the Fed goes to the government, the government benefits greatly.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Nonsense.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Really? If it&#39;s so impossible, how did the government&#39;s <a href="http://i.imgur.com/hwhSFTg.png">debt burden go down</a> nearly every year from 1946 to 1981?</p>

<p>What you&#39;re saying makes no sense. If you pay down the debt, then you pay down the debt. The Republican party decided in 1981 that it wanted to increase the debt, so the debt increased. They decided to borrow more than they paid back. It&#39;s that simple.</p>

<p>You are in the wrong sub to defend what knowledgeable folks will know is a nefarious organization that was/is the cause for every major economic crisis in the countries history since its inception.</p>

<p>Since you didn&#39;t like the abridged version I mentioned above, here are some facts about the Fed <a href="http://www.federalbudget.com/fed.html">Source</a></p>

<p>SUMMARY OF FACTS</p>

<p>1a. The Federal Reserve (FED) is a PRIVATELY OWNED, organization. Unbelievable? Check the ENCYCLOPAEDIA BRITANNICA.</p>

<p>b. Below is the list of the owners of the 12 Central Banks:
- <strong>Rothschild Bank of London</strong>
- <strong>Rothschild Bank of Berlin</strong>
- Lazard Brothers of Paris
- Israel Moses Seif Banks of Italy
- Warburg Bank of Amsterdam
- Warburg Bank of Hamburg
- Lehman Brothers of New York
- Kuhn Loeb Bank of New York
- Goldman, Sachs of New York
- Chase Manhattan Bank of New York</p>

<p>In all, there are about 300 VERY POWERFUL, partly foreign individuals that owns the FED.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Although the FED is required to give back most of its PROFITS back to the Treasury Dept., there is NO ORGANIZATION that has the power to AUDIT the FED (not even the Congress or the IRS). This creates a HUGE opportunity for creative accounting to hide the profit that ROBS the US Tax Payers Hundreds of Billions of Dollars annually.</p></li>
<li><p>Every year, a few Congressmen introduce a legislation to AUDIT the FED; and every year, the legislation is defeated. The FED has the most powerful, invisible lobbying power there is.</p></li>
<li><p>The owners of the FED own the controlling interests in ALL major media in the US. Rockefeller, through Chase Manhattan bank, controls CBS and ABC and 28 other broadcasting firms. Each of the other owners of the FED also have controlling interest in the US media. This explain why the media have been silent about the FED scam. The FED fraud is the biggest and longest cover-up in the US today.</p></li>
<li><p>According to Article 1, Section 8 of the Constitution, the US Congress has the power to print money (The Congress shall have the power to coin money, regulate the value thereof, and of foreign coin, ... According to the Supreme Court, the Congress can not transfer its power to other organization like the FED.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>After several attempts to push the Federal Reserve Banking Act through Congress, a group of bankers funded and staffed Woodrow Wilson&#39;s campaign for President. In 1913, Nelson Aldrich, maternal grandfather to the Rockefellers, pushed the Federal Reserve Act through Congress just before Christmas, when most Congressmen were on vacation. Naturally, President Wilson passed the Act when he was elected as a pay back to the bankers.</p>

<p>HOW THE OWNERS OF THE FED PROFIT AT OUR EXPENSE</p>

<p>The US government runs a deficit annually. To cover this, the US government issues bonds which are bought by the FED.</p>

<p>Since the FED has the POWER TO PRINT MONEY, it can buy any amount of the US Government bonds at almost NO COST, save for the expense of printing money (approximately 3 cents per $100).</p>

<p>At this point, the owners of the FED already profit $99.97 for every 3 cents they invested to print the money. Basically, they exchange something that costs almost nothing to them with the US Government Bonds.</p>

<p>Since the FED can NOT be AUDITTED by the IRS (or even by Congress), most of this profit can go anywhere the FED owners want to. BTW, did I mention that the profit is TAX-FREE?</p>

<p>After buying the bonds, the owner of the FED can either:
1. Keep the bonds, and collect the interest the US Government now OWES them.
2. Sell the bonds to the US Tax Payers or foreigners.</p>

<p>In either case, the FED owners have profited $99.97 for every 3 cents it invested to print the money. Remember, the FED is a PRIVATELY OWNED corporation, just like the Federal Express. The profit of the FED goes to the FED owners.</p>

<p>The US Government now owes the FED owners the interest on those bonds. Remember that the FED owners DO NOT EARN the bonds. They simply PRINT the money to buy the bonds. In other words, they created money out of thin air, and exchange it for the interest bearing bonds.</p>

<p>In order to pay for the bonds&#39; interest, the US Government taxes the US population.</p>

<p>When a US Citizen holding US Government bonds receives his/her return of investment on the bonds, essentially the money he/she receives is the tax money he/she is paying to the Government.</p>

<p>When the OWNERS of the FED receive the interest on the BONDS they&#39;re holding, they are receiving that money for FREE (save the initial 3 cents per $100 investment to print the money)! Not only that, the FED owners receive the money TAX FREE.
Under the LAW, the FED is REQUIRED to RETURN its PROFIT back to the US Treasury. However, NEITHER the Congress NOR the IRS have the POWER to AUDIT the FED. The FED has used this obvious loophole to profit via creative accounting.</p>

<p>Consider this: every year, the FED profits by hundreds of billions of dollars by buying US Government Bonds. Yet it only returns approximately $20 billion to the US Treasury. The rest of the profit has been spent as Operational Expense.</p>

<p>The FED expects us to believe that the FED operational expenses amounts to $100s billion dollars annually!!!
The truth is, those profits were spent as &quot;DIVIDENDS TO SHAREHOLDERS&quot;!!!! Year after year, the FED owners bleed the US Tax Payer dry by hundreds of billions of dollars. Keep this going, and the US will go bankrupt in a few more years. Small wonder why the National Debt is increasing at its current rate.</p>

<p>WHY THE FED SHOULD BE ABOLISHED</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The US Congress has the option to buy back the FED at $450 millions (per Congressional Records). When the Congress does this, it will own back the billions of US Government Bonds held by the FED. The US Government will actually PROFIT by buying back the FED! Also, the US government no longer has to pay interests to the FED owners on those bonds.</p></li>
<li><p>Through their ownerships in the FED, FOREIGN POWERS CAN and WILL influence the US economy. By controlling our interest rates and money supply, they can actually create economic disaster in the US , should the US disagree with them.</p></li>
<li><p>Although the FED directors must be confirmed by the Senate, the awesome lobbying power of the FED owners makes this process meaningless. The owners of the FED can and will put whoever they wish in the position.</p></li>
<li><p>Abolishing the FED will lead to lower inflation. At this moment, the FED prints as much money as needed to buy the US Government Bonds. Since the FED prints this MONEY out of THIN AIR, this leads to an INCREASE of MONEY SUPPLY, WITHOUT increase in GOODS/SERVICES. This, as all of us know it, leads to INFLATION.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>If the general public buy those bonds with money that they EARNED by providing GOODS/SERVICES, the money supply level is contant in relation to the goods/services level. Thus, there is no inflationary pressure from selling these bonds. 5. Abolishing the FED will reduce the national debt level. By buying back the FED at $450 millions, the US Government will buy back the billions of dollars of bonds held by the FED. Thus, the net effect is a reduction in national debt. After buying back the FED, the US Government does not have to pay interest on those bonds it buys back, further reducing the national debt.</p>

<ol>
<li>Abolishing the FED will lead to eventual balance budget. Today, even if the US Economy only grows by a meager 2% per year, the US Government should be able to put 2% of US-GDP dollars into circulation WITHOUT INFLATION.</li>
</ol>

<p>Consider, if the goods/services grow by 2% and the money supply grows by 2%, the ratio of goods/services vs. money supply remains constant. Thus, no inflation is created.</p>

<p>The government can use this extra money supply to fund its project without raising taxes.
As long as the government does not print money more than the goods and services available in the US , there will be no inflationary pressures.
This had in fact been done with Executive Order 11110 of President Kennedy. Kennedy ordered the Treasury Dept. to print a US GOVERNMENT NOTES (vs. FEDERAL RESERVE NOTES). In effect, Kennedy bypassed the FED by making the Treasury Department printed REAL US MONEY, instead of selling bonds to the FED for almost free.</p>

<p>The sad fact is, the US Government does not do this anymore. Instead, the US Government sell bonds to the FED, which buys those bonds using money they don&#39;t earn. Thus, the US Government must now pay interest on those money that it &quot;borrows&quot; from the FED.</p>

<ol>
<li>By point (6) above, the US Government can actually reduce taxes on everybody since it has more interest free money to spent in the amount equal to the growth of the US GDP. KEEP IN MIND, THIS MONEY WILL NOT CAUSE INFLATION, since the money is printed along with the growth of the goods and services.</li>
</ol>

<p>What you can do to save the United States of AmericaThe FED should either be AUDITTED every year, or be abolished. I have done my part providing this information. It is up to you to decide the future of the US economy. Please do the followings:</p>

<li>DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH!!!!
If everything that I wrote here sounds too far fetched to be true, I challenge everyone of you to do your own research, and see for yourself.</li>

<p>Hmmm, not sure who Joyce Cox is or why you trust her so much.</p>

<p>Joyce Cox claims:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>1a. The Federal Reserve (FED) is a PRIVATELY OWNED, organization. Unbelievable? Check the ENCYCLOPAEDIA BRITANNICA.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here is <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Federal-Reserve-System">what the Encyclopedia Britannica says</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>... The seven-member Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System determines the reserve requirements of the member banks within statutory limits, reviews and determines the discount rates established by the 12 Federal Reserve banks, and reviews the budgets of the reserve banks. The Chairman of the Board of Governors is appointed to a four-year term by the president of the United States.</p>

<p>A Federal Reserve bank is a privately owned corporation established pursuant to the Federal Reserve Act to serve the public interest; it is governed by a board of nine directors, six of whom are elected by the member banks and three of whom are appointed by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. The 12 Federal Reserve banks are located in Boston; New York City; Philadelphia; Chicago; San Francisco; Cleveland, Ohio; Richmond, Virginia; Atlanta, Georgia; St. Louis, Missouri; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Kansas City, Missouri; and Dallas, Texas. ...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Compare that to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/630wf1/how_the_federal_reserve_is_robbing_us_blind/dfqs8ds/">what I said above</a>: &quot;The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System is a federal agency, led by seven governors who are nominated by the President of the United States and confirmed by the United States Senate. The 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks are not part of the federal government. There is a mixture of public and private control for the regional banks. Each regional bank is a separate corporation, under the direction of a nine member board of directors. Six of the nine directors are chosen by all the member banks in that region. The remaining three are appointed by the Board of Governors (the federal agency).&quot;</p>

<p>Joyce Cox claims:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>b. Below is the list of the owners of the 12 Central Banks: - Rothschild Bank of London - Rothschild Bank of Berlin - Lazard Brothers of Paris - Israel Moses Seif Banks of Italy - Warburg Bank of Amsterdam - Warburg Bank of Hamburg - Lehman Brothers of New York - Kuhn Loeb Bank of New York - Goldman, Sachs of New York - Chase Manhattan Bank of New York</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That list is a hoax, as I <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/4e639r/the_federal_reserve_cartel_the_eight_families/d1xgin3">have pointed out before</a>.</p>

<p>As I said before, the Board of Governors is a federal agency, so it has no owners. Each of the regional Federal Reserve Banks does have stock. It is held by all the member banks in that district. The Federal Reserve tells each member bank how much stock it must own based on the member bank&#39;s balance sheet. The stock cannot be traded. More stock entitles the member bank to more dividends, but not more control over the Federal Reserve Bank. Each member bank gets two votes for the board of directors.</p>

<p>Joyce Cox claims:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In all, there are about 300 VERY POWERFUL, partly foreign individuals that owns the FED.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, there are no individuals or families that own Federal Reserve Bank stock.</p>

<p>Joyce Cox claims:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>2. Although the FED is required to give back most of its PROFITS back to the Treasury Dept., there is NO ORGANIZATION that has the power to AUDIT the FED (not even the Congress or the IRS).

<p>Joyce Cox claims:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>3. Every year, a few Congressmen introduce a legislation to AUDIT the FED; and every year, the legislation is defeated. The FED has the most powerful, invisible lobbying power there is.</p>

<p>These Congressman want to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/621hht/a_house_panel_led_by_rep_jason_chaffetz_on/dfk055t/">audit the monetary policy</a> of the Federal Reserve. Some people think that&#39;s a bad idea.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McCulloch_v._Maryland">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McCulloch_v._Maryland</a></p>

<p>Joyce Cox claims:</p>

<p>4. The owners of the FED own the controlling interests in ALL major media in the US. Rockefeller, through Chase Manhattan bank, controls CBS and ABC and 28 other broadcasting firms. Each of the other owners of the FED also have controlling interest in the US media. This explain why the media have been silent about the FED scam.

<p>She provides no evidence for this.</p>

According to the Supreme Court, the Congress can not transfer its power to other organization like the FED.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Supreme Court ruled that it is Constitutional for the federal government to charter a bank which issues bank notes, starting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McCulloch_v._Maryland">in 1819</a>. They have never ruled that it is unconstitutional.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the Supreme Court <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_Tender_Cases">did rule</a> that it was unconstitutional for Congress to issue legal tender paper money, although they later changed their minds.</p>

<p>Joyce Cox claims:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>After several attempts to push the Federal Reserve Banking Act through Congress, a group of bankers funded and staffed Woodrow Wilson&#39;s campaign for President.

</blockquote>

<p>This confuses several things. Nelson Aldrich (a Republic) tried to pass his National Reserve Act in 1910, but failed.</p>

<p>Woodrow Wilson ran for President in 1912, and one of his campaign promises was to reform the monetary and banking system. When he was elected, the Democrats came up with the Federal Reserve Act, which was similar in some ways to Aldrich&#39;s plan, but also had important differences. The Federal Reserve bill was debated throughout the year. Most bankers and most Republicans were against the bill. The House and Senate passed different versions of the bill, so a conference committee was formed to come up with a compromise.</p>

<p>The compromise bill passed the House by an overwhelming majority of 298 to 60 on December 22, 1913 and passed the Senate the next day by a vote of 43 to 25. An earlier version of the bill had passed the Senate 54 to 34, but almost 30 senators had left for Christmas vacation by the time the final bill came to a vote.

</blockquote>

<p>This is an outrageous lie. The Fed&#39;s audited financial statements are <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/audited-annual-financial-statements.htm">available on the internet</a>.</p>

<p>In 2015, the Fed <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/annual-report/statistical-tables/2015-statistical-table-10.htm">reported</a> operational expenses of $4 billion and total net expenses of $11 billion. And that&#39;s the highest it has ever been. It has <em>never</em> reported &quot;$100s billion dollars annually&quot;.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what year this was written, except it says &quot;Call your representatives and ask them to support legislation introduced by Congressman Henry Gonzales to repeal the Federal Reserve Act of 1913&quot;. Gonzales was in Congress from 1961 to 1999. During that time, the total Federal Reserve income was $492.5 billion. Of that, 90% ($445 billion) went to the federal government!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I used to be opposed to the Federal Reserve system until I actually decided to learn a little bit about economics and realized that it&#39;s actually essential for a large economy. Monetary policy, via the Fed, is what allows excessive deflation/inflation to be mitigated before it gets too bad. I&#39;m definitely not saying that the people currently running the Fed aren&#39;t corrupt, or that it shouldn&#39;t be audited more heavily, but I&#39;m saying that the concept of a centralized bank is actually super useful.</p>

<p>As far as the Great Depression goes, the GD would likely have been prevented if the Fed had taken more aggressive action to buy out Treasury Bonds on the open market and inject more cash into the banks. They couldn&#39;t do this at the time because of the gold standard, and the law saying that they needed to have a certain percentage of their assets backed in gold at any one time. They also just didn&#39;t really know what the fuck they were doing. The GD made a lot of economic theorists re-evaluate all of their beliefs.</p>

<p>The purpose of the Federal Reserve is to regulate how much currency is in circulation, to make sure that it always corresponds to the sum total of economic value that currently exists. It shouldn&#39;t be run by Laissez Faire chumps like Greenspan, but with an economy our size, and with how volatile some of our markets are, being able to quickly change how many dollars are circulating is an indispensable tool.</p>

<p>Saying &quot;the payroll tax pays off the federal reserve&quot; doesn&#39;t really make any sense. Any government agency is &quot;paid off&quot; by taxes. Taxation is essential for having a standardized unit of currency. The government&#39;s ability to collect tax is what gives it a near infinite ability to create value, thus allowing any credit issued by the government to be universally accepted as legal tender. In other words, no one is worried that the U.S. Treasury isn&#39;t good for the money because everyone knows that they have a never-ending supply by taking a little chunk of all the value that is produced in the economy. However, it would be nice if they didn&#39;t steal our taxes and buy bombs for Israel with it.</p>

<p>And before you say &quot;the Fed isn&#39;t a government agency, it&#39;s a private corporation,&quot; that&#39;s only partially true. The Fed is more heavily subject to Federal Regulations than any private bank. The reason it&#39;s kept private is to prevent short-term interests of members of Congress from influencing long-term interests of the economy. A Senate majority that wants to keep its seats next year is going to be more interested in short-term rapid economic growth than long-term stability, and they shouldn&#39;t be making monetary policy decisions.</p>

<p>Wow did I really just write all of that? I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m looking to gain by defending the Fed on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> lol ... </p>

<p>I&#39;d recommend to anyone looking to get a more intuitive grasp on what money is and how economy works to check out the book, &quot;Money: The Unauthorized Biography&quot; by Felix Martin. It really helped me get a better understanding of just what exactly money is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The general idea to everything in government is that if the people running the show are virtuous and well we wouldn&#39;t have a lot of the problems we do. The Fed is inherently set up as an entity that uses corruption as a tool. In its present state you could never hope for a central bank to be fair or just. I get that a central bank with people that only did their job and nothing more could be good, but I doubt we will ever have that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But isn&#39;t that what we&#39;re striving for?</p>

<p>If we just resign to the &quot;people aren&#39;t virtuous, so they&#39;ll always abuse their power&quot; mindset then how can we have any actionable plan or systemic changes in mind?</p>

<p>Abolishing the Federal Reserve isn&#39;t going to make all of those people disappear, or become any less powerful, they&#39;ll just find another avenue for corruption, manipulation, and abuse. I understand the desire to do away with it, but if you&#39;re really trying to work on turning this world into a functional place, doing away with that kind of infrastructure seems foolish.</p>

<p>If evil men are running trains full of darkness all over the country, we don&#39;t rip up the train tracks, because then we don&#39;t get to use them</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure what a train full of darkness is lol, but it seemed like a nice metaphor.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes it is. By buying or selling bonds to the private banks, they determine how much cash the banks have to use, which in turn affects the interest rates and magnitude at which the banks will issue credit. If  they sell bonds to the banks, then there is less cash to go around and the private banks will charge higher interest rates, not lend as much, and growth will slow down. </p>

<p>If the fed buys its bonds back from the banks then the banks now have more cash so they can lend more money at lower interest rates, spurring growth. </p>

<p>The Fed is BS. As Ron Paul said, the founding fathers wanted only Gold and Silver to be legal tender. Fuck having a monopoly on printing money. And you wonder why the NWO shit their pants over Bitcoin...</p>

<p>End the Fed and shut it down.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Having precious metal as the only legal tender is inherently problematic when you consider how quickly the population is growing (not to mention the fact that over 90% of the money in the US economy is not represented with a physical token). The amount of value in the economy is increasing dramatically, not only from a growing population, but from increased productivity from advancing technology, as well as (sadly) manufactured desire for consumer trash. Gold is scarce and limited. You don&#39;t want to have a legal tender that you can run out of, unless your population and economy are stable.</p>

<p>What material you make your tokens out of is ultimately irrelevant. The only value that gold and silver have is that they are durable, malleable, chemically inert, and scarce, and the only reason scarcity is desirable is so that you can control the production of money. You don&#39;t have to worry about everyone minting their own gold coins because gold isn&#39;t something you can just go find lying around anywhere. Also, it&#39;s shiny and cool looking. That meant a lot to primitive people.</p>

<p>If there wasn&#39;t a centralized authority for printing money the economy would be a disaster. A dollar bill is a token of credit. That credit is only transferrable if the debtor (the US Treasury) is regarded by everyone to be creditworthy. If your neighbor Bob started printing Bob Dollars, they would be of no use for anyone who doesn&#39;t know Bob, because they can&#39;t be sure that his credit is worth anything. The current system of standardized currency has worked itself out through many centuries of international trade. Letting everyone have their own form of money is chaotic and unmanageable. </p>

<p>The concept of a central bank isn&#39;t the problem, it&#39;s the lack of accountability. We need the Fed to be semi-private in order to keep short-term political motivations out of the equation, but unfortunately our current system has the Fed basically doing whatever the fuck it wants and nobody&#39;s allowed to do anything about it. But, the solution is not to abolish the Federal Reserve Bank, it&#39;s to regulate it more. Though it seems that you Paul supporters are all anti-regulation, so I&#39;m not sure what you guys even want lol</p>
