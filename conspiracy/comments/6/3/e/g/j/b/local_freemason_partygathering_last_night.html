        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So yesterday, while I was waiting for my girlfriend at the bus station, I noticed that a lot of cars where parking behind the lodge (the lodge is the old hotel HARDIA) and they had a flag with the Knights Templar cross on raised. Plus, I walked by some of them and they where wearing a pin with the square and compass.</p>

<p>So I was wondering if the 3th of April has a meaning to the Freemasons or if anyone else noticed a gathering at a lodge close to them?</p>

<p>Also, I&#39;m looking for some sources to read more about the masons, so if you have any or can send me in the right direction I would appreciate it</p>

<p>That&#39;s most of masonry. Good old boys network, drinking beer, slapping dicks.</p>

<p>The higher levels are very different. Among the general population, less than 1% are masons. Among the powerful, it&#39;s often 20% or more. There&#39;s certainly a concentration of power.</p>

<p>That&#39;s the hook. It sounds like a fraternal brotherhood of people trying to make the world a better place. And centuries ago, it may have been. But it&#39;s not anymore, certainly not at the top.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I would suggest reading Manly P Hall, then. He will give you a much better explanation of the esotericism than most lodges, and you don&#39;t have to swear blood oaths.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a common claim on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. Of course, there&#39;s no way to prove or disprove it. All I can say is that I&#39;ve been a Mason for nearly 30 years. I&#39;m a Master Mason, Past Master of my lodge, a member of my Grand Lodge, 32nd degree in the Scottish Rite, and PHP of my Royal Arch Chapter (part of the York Rite). In that time and in those positions, I haven&#39;t seen anything to give me reason to believe anything nefarious is going on.</p>

<li>You&#39;re low level, and don&#39;t know the <em>real</em> secrets.</li>

    <div class="md"><p>You are the typical Mason that we speak of. I don&#39;t mean to be rude, but if you&#39;re going to join an organization like that why don&#39;t you do any real research first? Go read Manly P. Hall&#39;s &quot;The Secret Teachings of All Ages&quot;, and Albert Pike&#39;s &quot;Morals and Dogma&quot;.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t know jack about what&#39;s going on because you&#39;re not important enough to them. If you&#39;re not already in a position of authority, power and wealth it&#39;s not likely they would initiate you into higher degrees. Also, if you&#39;ve shown compassion for others or faith in Jesus Christ they&#39;ll likely keep you at a lower degree.</p>

<p>Do you know who you&#39;re really important to? Us. Humanity. God. Start your own secret society based on love, peace and goodwill toward all. You don&#39;t need secret handshakes, symbols, passwords or jewelry to do something big and wonderful in this world that will lead others back to the light. You only need love and empathy.</p>

<p>&quot;Masonry, like all the Religions, all the Mysteries, Hermeticism and Alchemy, conceals its secrets from all except the Adepts and Sages, or the Elect, and uses false explanations and misinterpretations of its symbols to mislead those who deserve only to be misled; to conceal the Truth, which it calls Light, from them, and to draw them away from it.&quot; Albert Pike, Morals and Dogma</p>

    <div class="md"><p>[Mason here] Its unclear where you&#39;re located. Be aware that my comments are from an American perspective.</p>

<p>April 3 has no particular Masonic significance. That you&#39;ve not seen much activity at the lodge may be a due to the time you pass by - most hold meetings in the evening hours on a weeknight. Generally, there&#39;s a meeting once a month (though around here, we &#39;go dark&#39; for July and August), and there may be extra meetings on different nights. In this case, a local York Rite body was apparently having one.</p>

<p>The YR is an appendant body of Masonry, which Master Masons can join if they wish. There are many such appendant bodies, the other two well known ones being the Scottish Rite and the Shriners.</p>

<p>I&#39;m a software engineer, and its a welcome piece of stability compared to my work life,, where anything I learned more than 5 years ago is ancient history. In Masonry, I can pick up a 100 year old book and its actually still useful. </p>

<p>Also, I&#39;m looking for some sources to read more about the masons, so if you have any or can send me in the right direction I would appreciate it</p>

<p>Manly P Hall is a good somewhat pro-masonry source. Bill Cooper&#39;s Mystery Babylon series is a good anti-masonry source. </p>

<p>Albert Pike&#39;s writings are particularly interesting, because he was so high up in the organization.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re looking for a very basic outline, the first 3 degrees are called the &quot;Blue Lodge.&quot; After that, you can join the York Rite (the Templars are the highest degree) or the Scottish Rite (goes up to 33 degrees). Once you complete those, you can join the Shrine.</p>

<p>There are tons of variations and supplemental groups, and each jurisdiction might be different, but those are the major groups to understand.</p>
