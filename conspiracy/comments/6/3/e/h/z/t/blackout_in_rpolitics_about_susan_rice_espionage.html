    <div class="md"><p>So this publically available information isn&#39;t enough for her to investigate: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Manafort was <a href="https://apnews.com/122ae0b5848345faa88108a03de40c5a">on the Russian payroll from 2005-2014</a> </p></li>
<li><p>Robert Mercer (Cambridge analytica [involved in brexit], cato, breitbart) &amp; Russian Oligarch&#39;s yachts met up at an island in the past week.. People are tracking Oligarch private jets like MKATE.</p></li>
<li><p>DNS lookups pinging every 10 minutes between Alfa Bank (Russian bank with ties to Putin) and Trump org. Potential Theories of either DNS-lookups as &quot;pings to indicate package/mail pickup&quot; or DNS-lookup pings as &quot;code-like content&quot; in place of emails potentially through mobile apps. Pings increased during RNC/DNC conventions. Pings at Trump org stopped when NYT/Slate asked direct questions to Alfa Bank (so Alfa told Trump org to stop the pings somehow). NYT/Slate had not asked those questions to Trump org.</p></li>
<li><p>Carter Page changed story to WSJ through text messages saying he had gone to Moscow, met with &quot;Russian think-tanks &amp; university officials.&quot; He lied on national television.</p></li>
<li><p>Paul Manafort lied on national television saying he wasn&#39;t involved in changing the RNC platform on Ukraine. J.D. Gordon confessed that Paul Manafort &amp; leadership ordered this.</p></li>
<li><p>Roger Stone communicated with Guccifer Russian hacker and admitted to back-chnnel comms to WL. He has been sent a letter from SIC to preserve Russia-related campaign-related documents.</p></li>
<li><p>Paul Manafort is wanted for questioning by prosecutors in Ukraine. He has told WashPo, &quot;It&#39;s not like they carry badges!&quot; regarding meeting with Russian spies.</p></li>
<li><p>DT bought a $40 million mansion... then sold it to Russian oligarch of fertilizer Rybolovlev for $95 million a few years later. Rybolovlev then demolished the estate to sell the property. Typically in the legal world this is called Money Laundering.</p></li>
<li><p>Campaign Lawyer Mike Cohen was caught around French islands in Europe, along with Russian oligarchs who also were vacationing around there. Oligarchs are used because they are not officials. 
Lawyer Cohen gave 4 different stories to 4 different news outlets about his involvement with Russians. He also claimed he never went to Czech, but actually had gone to Czech in the past, and there is suggestion that he has an Israeli pass port. These guys sure vacation a lot in Europe for some strange reason during the campaign even (are they vacationing or are they working?).</p></li>
<li><p>Interesting stories swirling around about Azerbaijan Baku hotel that DT was involved in along with Ivanka and other sons.</p></li>
<li><p>Dakota pipeline was going to be built with Russian steel.... when the media found out, quickly Sean Spicer tried to frame it as &quot;no we will buy american.&quot;
Russian propaganda that promoted DT for years since GOP primary stopped around late February. Indicating their dissatisfaction.</p></li>
<li><p>Russia has been murdering officials and their own people, some of whom charged with treason and accused of working for the US. Coverup of UN amb of Russia, who died in NYC, Coroner in NY told to withhold cause of death and refer questions to State Dep.
Russia launches investigation of US media.</p></li>
<li><p>Nigel Farage had dinner with DT, then Nigel Farage ended up in London near Ecuador hideout. He was asked by journalist if he was there to meet Julian, and he stated something like &quot;I don&#39;t talk about who I meet or where I go.&quot; Then the WL thing happened.</p></li>
<li><p>Russian botnets are on overtime attacking McCain, Graham, CNN, Evan McMullin, and others in the media. Same Russian botnets this week are promoting Le Pen &amp; attacking Merkel. Still ranting about globalism and muslims.</p></li>
<li><p>Senate Republicans and Senate Democrats have been asking questions about Russian money laundering and influence of media orgs and other tactics they use to influence elections.</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>Unless we&#39;re playing an inane game of semantics, which completely sidesteps the substance of the discussion, President Trump&#39;s tweet has absolutely been confirmed. How did this so-called incidental surveillance occur? Did leftist politicians fabricate the transcripts of these conversations? If not, there must have been some apparatus set up at Trump Tower to record calls made between him / his team and foreign officials. What should we call that hmm? At that point, the assertion of &quot;surveillance at Trump Tower&quot; is far from a lie.</p>

<p>And again, to what end was this information collected? Why have Adam Schiff and James Clapper refused to state in an official capacity that <em>any evidence</em> of Russian ties to the Trump campaign exist? What about Devin Nunes&#39; statement that most of the unmasked info had nothing to do with Russia at all? I eagerly await your reply 😉 </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re completely wrong, sorry.</p>

<p>To be clear, you still believe trump tower was targeted and surveilled itself in some way, based on the info we have?</p>

<p>If you talk to someone who&#39;s under surveillance, your conversation is going to be caught up in that. Do you understand and agree with that concept?</p>

<p>We don&#39;t know yet, investigations take time and maybe they won&#39;t ever find anything worthy of charges, or maybe they will. We don&#39;t know yet. </p>

<p>Schiff said there is more than circumstantial evidence of coordination. Did you not hear that?</p>

<p>There are other countries who we surveil, are you aware of that? If there was some contact with non Russian foreigners under surveillance, that would be caught up incidentally.</p>

Did they trigger you that bad? Take your fingers out of your ears and just try harder, I believe in you (I don&#39;t).</p>

<p>Here are a couple of bunts you totally whiffed:</p>

<p>1) How do you propose that surveillance took place? Absent the fabrication of transcripts, those calls had to have been recorded somehow...</p>

<p>2) You <em>must</em> be aware that we know considerably more about leaks/unmasking than any Russia connection. However, that hasn&#39;t stopped legacy media from covering these yet unsubstantiated claims 24/7...how do you explain the double standard?</p>

<p>Come on bluehat, these are really easy. Demonstrate that I should take you seriously, you&#39;ve done a piss poor job so far 😂</p>

<p>PS - Schiff from two days ago, way after his baseless claim of &quot;more than circumstantial evidence&quot; lol: <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2017/04/02/adam_schiff_there_is_no_definitive_proof_of_any_trump-russia_connection.html">There Is No &quot;Definitive&quot; Proof Of Any Trump-Russia Connection</a>.

Granted I haven&#39;t been watching tv news all day. And also of the leaks, and the content of them. Perhaps it is you who is choosing to ignore the content of the leaks?</p>

<p>Don&#39;t criticize me and my arguments when I&#39;ve addressed everything you&#39;ve said that is actually on topic. You&#39;ve made many unsubstantiated claims with no evidence and you&#39;ve done it in a very rude way.</p>

<p>Do you know there is a difference between &quot;definitive evidence&quot; and &quot;more than circumstantial evidence&quot;? Why are you equating the two?</p>

<p>Clapper says &quot;at the time of our report we had no evidence of collusion between the campaign and the Russians&quot;. That doesn&#39;t rule out that there is evidence now or that there was coordination short of collusion. I have a feeling you will see no difference in those words and that&#39;s one of the big problems with discussing this situation is the way that language is interpeted and spun.</p>

<p>I&#39;d suggest you be a bit nicer in your responses because your tone undermines your points.</p>

<p>You&#39;ve in no way proven that trumps claims of being surveilled by the Obama admin &quot;have absolutely been confirmed&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The world is mean dumbass, not every place is a safe space 😂 don&#39;t like what I&#39;m saying go cry somewhere else.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I wasted time reading all of your non-responses. I&#39;ll reiterate:</p>

<p>1) How do you suppose phone surveillance takes place? How did the IC get these transcripts containing Trump&#39;s team? Please enlighten me..</p>

<p>2) Just this morning, CNN alleged that the leaking stories / Susan Rice were a distraction formulated by President Trump to distract from the Russia narrative. This is schizophrenically insane, due to the imbalance of evidence on one side (are you smart enough to know which side I&#39;m referring to?)</p>

<p>LMAO the cognitive dissonance is <em>strong</em> in this one. I&#39;d love to hear your legal definition of &quot;more than circumstantial&quot;..I&#39;ll wait</p>

<p>Clapper made those statements after the inauguration. At the time of his statements, he had access to ALL INFORMATION regarding the investigation up to that point as Director if National Intelligence. We now know that the investigation had been going on since President Trump secured the Republican nomination in July. Are you <em>seriously</em> alleging that any evidence of value was collected after January 20th? That position totally demolishes the claims that any collusion happened during the campaign. Love to hear your expert insight on this one haha</p>

<p>Leftists like you give no respect to our President and deserve none in return. Typical low-testosterone crybaby</p>

    <div class="md"><p>this is what the Republicans always do. They did it with Benghazi, they did it with Eric Holder. They find something that is not illegal or even particularly problematic, but that is nonetheless complex. </p>

<p>They trust that their supporters aren&#39;t intelligent enough to understand the nuance or else won&#39;t bother trying to understand. &quot;Incidental collection, FISA warrants, unmasking, what is all that?&quot;</p>

<p>So the Republicans just wave their arms and shout and use words like &quot;Freedom,&quot; &quot;Obama,&quot; &quot;smoking gun,&quot; &quot;bombshell,&quot; &quot;unprecedented!,&quot; and &quot;cover up&quot; and their base just goes along with it, because they hate Obama and want it to be true.</p>

<p>What Rice is accused of doing (and likely did do) isn&#39;t illegal. It isn&#39;t surprising. It isn&#39;t interesting. And it isn&#39;t bad. If you want to have a high level policy discussion about how to balance privacy rights under the current intelligence gathering framework? Cool. Let&#39;s do that. But don&#39;t pretend this is an issue when you didn&#39;t give a fuck for the last sixteen years since you guys wrote and adopted the Patriot Act and then reauthorized it over and over.</p>

    DNS lookups pinging every 10 minutes between Alfa Bank (Russian bank with ties to Putin) and Trump org. Potential Theories of either DNS-lookups as &quot;pings to indicate package/mail pickup&quot; or DNS-lookup pings as &quot;code-like content&quot; in place of emails potentially through mobile apps. Pings increased during RNC/DNC conventions. Pings at Trump org stopped when NYT/Slate asked direct questions to Alfa Bank (so Alfa told Trump org to stop the pings somehow). NYT/Slate had not asked those questions to Trump org.
    Carter Page changed story to WSJ through text messages saying he had gone to Moscow, met with &quot;Russian think-tanks &amp; university officials.&quot; He lied on national television.
    Paul Manafort lied on national television saying he wasn&#39;t involved in changing the RNC platform on Ukraine. J.D. Gordon confessed that Paul Manafort &amp; leadership ordered this.
    Roger Stone communicated with Guccifer Russian hacker and admitted to back-chnnel comms to WL. He has been sent a letter from SIC to preserve Russia-related campaign-related documents.
    Paul Manafort is wanted for questioning by prosecutors in Ukraine. He has told WashPo, &quot;It&#39;s not like they carry badges!&quot; regarding meeting with Russian spies.
    DT bought a $40 million mansion... then sold it to Russian oligarch of fertilizer Rybolovlev for $95 million a few years later. Rybolovlev then demolished the estate to sell the property. Typically in the legal world this is called Money Laundering.
    Campaign Lawyer Mike Cohen was caught around French islands in Europe, along with Russian oligarchs who also were vacationing around there. Oligarchs are used because they are not officials. Lawyer Cohen gave 4 different stories to 4 different news outlets about his involvement with Russians. He also claimed he never went to Czech, but actually had gone to Czech in the past, and there is suggestion that he has an Israeli pass port. These guys sure vacation a lot in Europe for some strange reason during the campaign even (are they vacationing or are they working?).
    Interesting stories swirling around about Azerbaijan Baku hotel that DT was involved in along with Ivanka and other sons.
    Dakota pipeline was going to be built with Russian steel.... when the media found out, quickly Sean Spicer tried to frame it as &quot;no we will buy american.&quot;
    Russian propaganda that promoted DT for years since GOP primary stopped around late February. Indicating their dissatisfaction.
    Russia has been murdering officials and their own people, some of whom charged with treason and accused of working for the US. Coverup of UN amb of Russia, who died in NYC, Coroner in NY told to withhold cause of death and refer questions to State Dep.
    Russia launches investigation of US media.
    Nigel Farage had dinner with DT, then Nigel Farage ended up in London near Ecuador hideout. He was asked by journalist if he was there to meet Julian, and he stated something like &quot;I don&#39;t talk about who I meet or where I go.&quot; Then the WL thing happened.

    <div class="md"><p>Answers to your questions:</p>

<p>1) Flynn talked to the Russian ambassador who is under surveillance (do I have to explain how this means Flynns conversation with him is recorded?) -&gt; perhaps in investigating the Russian election influence, rice or someone else requested to unmask the US person in these intercepts -&gt; that request was granted and the unmasked transcripts were given to that person where they were then distributed throughout the intelligence community. I&#39;m not exactly sure of the mechanism for that but it seems it could have been as part of the Russia meddling documents or a more secret thing limited to certain people in the IC community.</p>

<p>Let me know if any of this doesn&#39;t make sense or if you have any refutations.</p>

<p>2) People have been saying that trumps outbursts or allegations about being wire tapped have been smokescreen to distract from his teams Russia connections. I don&#39;t disagree with them. When you say it&#39;s insane based on the imbalance of evidence I assume you must believe that you are aware of all evidence in both cases, which clearly none of us are. The investigation is still ongoing, right? Not to mention that the two aren&#39;t mutually exclusive. Trump could fully have been illegally spied on and it could also still be a smokescreen/distraction.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t use the term, schiff did. I&#39;m not aware of all of the evidence in the case and neither are you. </p>

<p>I quite frankly don&#39;t know what&#39;s being investigated. I think it&#39;s entirely possible that new evidence has come to light since clapper left. I don&#39;t know and neither do you. Are you not going to address the fact that coordination short of collusion could have happened? Or another crime? I don&#39;t know the details of the still ongoing investigation, do you?</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure you were super respectful of Obama. How did you show your respect for him? Why would I respect a president who said we should never and that the country could never withstand having a president under investigation by the FBI, who at that time and still to this day is under his own FBI investigation? Who stiffs every day contractors, cleaners, and other service providers? Who blasts a president for playing golf when he&#39;s on a pace to play far more rounds? Who said he&#39;d never leave the White House because he&#39;d be working too hard but goes on vacation every week on taxpayer money? Who&#39;s wife won&#39;t live in the whitehouse, costing taxpayers millions? who&#39;s national security advisor resigned in disgrace and now it turns out also didn&#39;t disclose his work representing foreign nations? who won&#39;t divest from his businesses when they clearly benefit from his position and from foreigners? Who can never admit being wrong? Who can&#39;t stop tweeting?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good lord you are dense.</p>

<p>1) So you concede that conversations involving Trump&#39;s team, and likely Trump as well, were recorded. Good job! To anyone with more than three brain cells working in tandem, this <em>absolutely substantiates President Trump&#39;s claim</em>. Just three weeks ago, President Trump was being ridiculed for suggesting that he was under surveillance at all. Are you mentally capable of seeing the change in narrative here or have I underestimated your stupidity?</p>

<p>Additionally if this information was being collected for ostensible use against the Russian ambassador, and the Americans &quot;incidentally caught up&quot; were not the target, why has it only been used for political purposes against said Americans? I&#39;m going to love to see you squirm out of this one LOL</p>

<p>2) Pump the brakes there bluehat my boy, when you assume you make an ASS out of U and ME (in this case just you). The evidence I am referring to are Susan Rice&#39;s own statements to NBC&#39;s Andrea Mitchell, admitting surveillance and unmasking of Trump and his team. As well as Evelyn Farkas&#39; statements to Mika Brzezinski, detailing the process by which Democrats frantically collected intelligence against Trump and leaked it to the media. This information confirms actual felonies. It&#39;s not hard to understand, so I really hope you&#39;re being willfully ignorant. Regarding Russia, I&#39;m glad you are willing to admit that you know nothing..it&#39;s a good first step. But then how can you be so confident in asserting the presence of a Trump-Russia connection? There is no factual support for these allegations. So what would President Trump be distracting from, exactly?</p>

<p>I hate to rub it in (I love it tbh), but you used the exact phrase in your last post:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do you know there is a difference between &quot;definitive evidence&quot; and &quot;more than circumstantial evidence&quot;? Why are you equating the two?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Do you always use phrases you don&#39;t understand? Is it to seem more intelligent? You&#39;ll need more than that to fool me. But thank you for again admitting you &quot;don&#39;t know&quot; and can&#39;t defend your point.</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t know what&#39;s being investigated then why are you attempting to speak with authority on the subject? From my last post:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Clapper made those statements after the inauguration. At the time of his statements, he had access to ALL INFORMATION regarding the investigation up to that point as Director of National Intelligence. We now know that the investigation had been going on since President Trump secured the Republican nomination in July.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So when do you think the coordination/collusion (words I&#39;m not confident you know the definition of) took place? Clapper&#39;s statements <em>preclude</em> it from having happened during the campaign. Your expert insight...?</p>

<p>I see you&#39;ve devolved into triggered ranting by the end here...bluehat buddy you&#39;re just going to have to get smarter. Your last post was one Yuge &quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; which leaves me wondering why you have such a strong opinion on it in the first place. I would recommend reading my post with a dictionary on hand for the tough words, and then reading it again just to make sure you understand the larger points. Cry to whoever you want in an attempt to silence me, it just reinforces my beliefs about you.</p>

<p>And I voted for Obama twice dumbshit...if only I knew then what I know now.</p>

You either don&#39;t read my responses, are too thick to understand them, or are willfully ignorant of what I&#39;m saying, so this discussion isn&#39;t in good faith.

<p>You don&#39;t know the extent of the investigation, you don&#39;t know what evidence has been found, continues to be found, or may be found in the future.</p>

To anyone with more than three brain cells working in tandem, this <em>absolutely substantiates President Trump&#39;s claim</em>. <strong>Just three weeks ago, President Trump was being ridiculed for suggesting that he was under surveillance at all. Are you mentally capable of seeing the change in narrative here or have I underestimated your stupidity?</strong></p>

<p>Additionally <strong>if this information was being collected for ostensible use against the Russian ambassador, and the Americans &quot;incidentally caught up&quot; were not the target, why has it only been used for political purposes against said Americans</strong>? I&#39;m going to love to see you squirm out of this one LOL</p>

<p>2) Pump the brakes there bluehat my boy, when you assume you make an ASS out of U and ME (in this case just you). <strong>The evidence I am referring to are Susan Rice&#39;s own statements to NBC&#39;s Andrea Mitchell, admitting surveillance and unmasking of Trump and his team. As well as Evelyn Farkas&#39; statements to Mika Brzezinski, detailing the process by which Democrats frantically collected intelligence against Trump and leaked it to the media. This information confirms actual felonies.</strong> It&#39;s not hard to understand, so I really hope you&#39;re being willfully ignorant. Regarding Russia, I&#39;m glad you are willing to admit that you know nothing..it&#39;s a good first step. But then how can you be so confident in asserting the presence of a Trump-Russia connection? There is no factual support for these allegations. So <strong>what would President Trump be distracting from, exactly</strong>?</p>

<p>**I hate to rub it in (I love it tbh), but you used the exact phrase in your last post:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do you know there is a difference between &quot;definitive evidence&quot; and &quot;more than circumstantial evidence&quot;? Why are you equating the two?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Do you always use phrases you don&#39;t understand?** Is it to seem more intelligent? You&#39;ll need more than that to fool me. But thank you for again admitting you &quot;don&#39;t know&quot; and can&#39;t defend your point.</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t know what&#39;s being investigated then why are you attempting to speak with authority on the subject? From my last post:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Clapper made those statements after the inauguration. At the time of his statements, he had access to ALL INFORMATION regarding the investigation up to that point as Director of National Intelligence. We now know that the investigation had been going on since President Trump secured the Republican nomination in July.</p>

<p>So <strong>when do you think the coordination/collusion (words I&#39;m not confident you know the definition of) took place? Clapper&#39;s statements <em>preclude</em> it from having happened during the campaign.</strong> Your expert insight...?</p>

<p>I see you&#39;ve devolved into triggered ranting by the end here...bluehat buddy you&#39;re just going to have to get smarter. Your last post was one Yuge &quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; which leaves me wondering why you have such a strong opinion on it in the first place.

<p>Begging the Question: a circular argument in which the conclusion is included in the premise.</p>

<p>Burden of Proof: saying that the burden of proof lies not with the person making the claim, but with someone else to disprove.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, recorded as part of incidental surveillance. Not sure what the claim is in that first building? Doesn&#39;t seem to be one that I haven&#39;t already discredited.</p>

<p>President trump didn&#39;t say he was under surveillance at all. That&#39;s not what he claimed but if you want to change the easily verifiable claims or misinterpret them I can&#39;t change that. What change in narrative? You&#39;ve misrepresented the narrative so you have no basis to say it changed.</p>

<p>Who said what the goal or use of the surveillance of the Russian ambassador was? I believe it&#39;s routine surveillance, to understand the contacts, discussions, what the ambassador is up to and what the Russian government is concerned with. How do you claim to know the full extent of what the surveillance has been, is being, or will be used for? How had the information been used for political purposes other than the leaks that led to Flynns resignation? Or is that the only thing you&#39;re referring  to?</p>

<p>You&#39;ve misrepresented the statements of both rice and farkas. Rice denied knowing what nunes was talking about in his confusing press conference. Farkas detailed the concerns that the incoming administration would bury the investigation into its connections to Russia, connections now proven that it had hidden at every step.</p>

<p>His teams Russian connections and his own corruption, possible indebtedness to powerful Russians, Russian mob, and powerful Chinese. </p>

<p>Honestly don&#39;t know what point you&#39;re trying to make about rubbing it in. There is a difference between definitive evidence of collusion and more than circumstantial evidence. I don&#39;t know what schiff was referring to with his comments, it&#39;s not public.</p>

<p>I believe I understand what those phrases mean, do you?</p>

<p>Do you believe that all information pertinent to an investigation is immediately known when an investigation commences? That seems to be what you&#39;re implying by saying that clapper wasn&#39;t aware of definitive evidence of collusion. Do you believe that the FBI and both houses will keep investigating something after they find that there is no definitive evidence to support their investigations? I&#39;m trying to understand why you think not having evidence for a specific claim in one part of an investigation rules out any possibility of wrongdoing in any other part of an investigation? It could have happened and the evidence may not have come to light or been definitive at the time clapper was interviewed. can you prove there is no evidence?</p>

<p>Why would I care who you voted for? </p>

<p>Now please address every point here one at a time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First claim, that unmasking equates to surveillance of trump - false. Trump was not targeted and may not have been even caught up in incidental surveillance. We know members of his team were, but that&#39;s not why he claimed. He claimed that Obama had wire tapped trump tower. Those claims remain disproven.</p>

<p>Second claim that there must have been an apparatus: I&#39;ve explained many times how the incidental surveillance occurred, but you keep concluding that a spying apparatus was set up in trump tower. Not the case. Trumps team spoke to people under surveillance so those conversations were recorded. It&#39;s as simple as that. The fact that happened does not mean there is an apparatus to spy on trump.</p>

<p>It could have been illegal if by dissemination you mean leaking to the media? We don&#39;t know she did that but anything is possible. She denied it today.

<p>No, that doesn&#39;t make sense to me. And that&#39;s not what I meant at all.</p>

<p>When I said targeted I was referencing the unmasking.  It sounds like Rice took incidental collection and exploited it when she found Trump and or his personnel on the phone.  Too early to tell, but at the very least she needs to be investigated.</p>

<p>We know that someone illegally leaked Flynn&#39;s name and his transcripts, so it&#39;s no real stretch to ask if someone was illegally sharing information on Trump.  And Susan Rice is no paragon of truth.  She lied about Benghazi, and last week she feigned ignorance about any unmasking.</p>

At the time he made them, Clapper had access to ALL INFORMATION regarding the investigation up to that point. Schill&#39;s statements from a few days ago reinforce this: <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2017/04/02/adam_schiff_there_is_no_definitive_proof_of_any_trump-russia_connection.html">There Is No &quot;Definitive&quot; Proof Of Any Trump-Russia Connection</a>.</p>

<p>So when do you think the coordination/collusion (words I&#39;m not confident you know the definition of) took place? Clapper&#39;s statements preclude it from having happened during the campaign. Again, curious as to your nuanced opinion.</p>

<p>Bonus Question: What evidence is there that Russia influenced one vote in the 2016 Presidential Election? If you can&#39;t prove this, then why does contact with Russians even matter?</p>

<p>And not to be a total dick and rub it in, but your entire argument is based on a logical fallacy that invalidates it on-face:</p>

<p>Appeal to Authority: using the opinion of an authority figure, or institution of authority, in place of an actual argument.</p>

<p>Also, the National Security Advisor is absolutely allowed to ask for the unmasking of these people. You&#39;re just flat out wrong in your claim.

&quot;Why in the world were conversations about Trump’s family picked up and potentially unmasked and disseminated around government? This would clearly seem to run afoul of minimization procedures, which are meant to protect U.S. citizens from such surveillance.&quot;</p>

<p>It depends, did the cop have probable cause? Just based on publicly available information now, it certainly appears she did. I not, I hope she&#39;s prosecuted for whatever crime she broke.</p>

<p>But 2 wrongs do not make a right, and we won&#39;t know if Trump is guilty of treason until these investigations finish. So it&#39;s far too early to know if she had probable cause. Until that time comes, I&#39;m filing this story under &quot;classic deflection&quot;.</p>

<p>One thing I can say about this is that Snopes is very carefyl about how they respond to anything. If they cannot debunk it they usually debunk something else with tricky wording making it sound like they are referring to the question, when really they pulled a fast one on the reader.</p>

<p>I wish I had the example that usually gets passed around for this, but I don&#39;t think there are as many situations where you can outright say they were wrong, just that they conveniently avoided addressing the actual issue.</p>

<p>Look at that <a href="http://i.imgur.com/fItaEy9.png">chart</a> (taken from a post detailing <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/television/comments/5agmik/cnn_drops_commentator_after_finding_she_provided/d9gj9eb/">evidence</a> of CTR presence).

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, I remember... that was also the time that Reddit switched overnight from being as pro-Sanders (which seemed legitimately organic, just as the website was pro-Paul in 2012) then to magically being pro-Clinton, despite the overwhelming majority of Sanders supporters being infuriated by the DNC&#39;s disenfranchisement. I also remember when mods shut down SandersforPresident in an equally unceremonious fashion. </p>

<p>For all the fuckery that was afoot during the election, few things beat DNCLeaks churning out the Podesta email findings. That also highlighted T_D in their heyday, too.</p>

<p>Thanks to the election cycle, though, I don&#39;t even browse all of Reddit anymore. The front page is astroturfed fluff, and the &quot;important&quot; subreddits like politics are even worse. </p>

<p>So for me, it means 3 things. Either 1) Trump or his people were communicating with Russians and had their talks monitored and collected. They were talking about legal things or non-campaign issues etc. Nothing was wrong and they should have remained &quot;American 1&quot; and that was it. </p>

<p>2) Trump or his people were communicating with Russians and had their talks monitored and collected. They were talking about illegal things or campaign issues etc. Something was wrong and they should have been unmasked from &quot;American 1&quot; to &quot;Insert Trump guy&#39;s name here&quot; and then would have been arrested.</p>

<p>3) Obama had his admin spy on Trump and his associates and now it is being called necessary because of the &quot;The Russian&#39;s hacked out campaign&quot; narrative. </p>

<p>To an extent, yes.  But there are members of our government who can see who is being masked.  I think Michael Rogers, head of the NSA, said in front of Congress that about two dozen people have the authority to unmask (I forget if just in NSA or all of government), for example.  The unmasking isn&#39;t permanent, though.  The identities are unmasked only to the person&#39;s eyes who requested access to the identity (or anyone with the authority to look).  </p>

<blockquote>

<p>We know that the incidental collection was collected because those recorded were talking with someone who had a Section 702 FISA warrant against them.  Obama can&#39;t give himself that warrant.  The agency wishing to spy on someone has to go to a FISA court for the 702 warrant, and so far, no one on other side of the aisle have questioned that warrant.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Unless the information collected is still being used in an ongoing investigation as a lead.  This is something else that worries me.  If they were talking about something illegal, that means there is far more to what we all know about the extent of any possible connections to Russia.</p>

<p>Just deferring to what I said in my last comment: this was someone influential, whether influential in the campaign/politics or the country, speaking with the target of a Section 702 warrant.  I don&#39;t think it&#39;s concerning the National Security Advisor wanted the information, but what&#39;s important, to me, is what happened with that information.</p>

<p>In ordinary circumstances, I completely agree that the identities should have stayed &quot;American 1,&quot; and so on.  But I don&#39;t think when we&#39;re talking about people very close with a President-elect (or candidate, etc.) I believe those circumstances to be extraordinary enough for the National Security Advisor to know who was involved.  I think any connection between a campaign, or campaign official, and a foreign power is, or can become, a national security risk.</p>

<p>Wouldn&#39;t it only be extraordinary circumstances if something was actually going on that shouldn&#39;t? Either nothing was going on and Trump(&#39;s people) were talking to Russians or there was evidence of it and it needed to be unmasked because of an ongoing investigation. With how much the media is talking about this, you&#39;d think there were multiple smoking guns and there would have been charges brought by now.</p>

<p>I also wouldn&#39;t be too surprised if someone was influenced to report if they saw any of Trump&#39;s associates or anything in the Intel they had. That&#39;s a bit more &quot;conspiracy&quot; though.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think a person&#39;s influence should change how they are treated though, to be house.</p>

<p>Same to you!</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>This is what I&#39;ve been going back and forth on for a while, now.  There is nothing wrong, in my eyes, with talking to a foreign government.  I would love stronger ties between the US and Russia, because I do not know much about my ancestors who lived there.  Travelling to Moscow and through Russia to learn more about them would be amazing.</p>

<p>But on the other hand, Russia is still a geopolitical nemesis, at this time.  As much as I would love for Russia and the US to get along, we shouldn&#39;t be treating them as friends, right now.  They are not.  So I do start to get concerned with anyone who is seemingly very close with them (note: not people who just support the countries working together and trying to get along, like me).  But then for this to be about, not only someone in/working closely with (or similar), someone our own government deemed a worthy surveillance target.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>With how much the media is talking about this, you&#39;d think there were multiple smoking guns and there would have been charges brought by now.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Only time will tell on this one.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also, The President, through the AG, can order surveillance on people.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A little further down in the law, you&#39;ll find this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>(3) The Attorney General shall immediately transmit under seal to the court established under section 1803(a) of this title a copy of his certification. Such certification shall be maintained under security measures established by the Chief Justice with the concurrence of the Attorney General, in consultation with the Director of National Intelligence, and shall remain sealed unless—
(A) an application for a court order with respect to the surveillance is made under sections 1801(h)(4) and 1804 of this title; or
(B) the certification is necessary to determine the legality of the surveillance under section 1806(f) of this title.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So this would all come down to what the agreed upon security measures are between the Chief Justice, DNI, and AG.  <em><a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/1805">50 U.S. Code § 1805 - Issuance of order</a></em> creates the possibility of judicial overview, as well:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>At or before the end of the period of time for which electronic surveillance is approved by an order or an extension, the judge may assess compliance with the minimization procedures by reviewing the circumstances under which information concerning United States persons was acquired, retained, or disseminated.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So an AG would need a DNI, Chief Justice, and 11 judges to all be in on their plan, without anyone finding out.  There is the chance that does happen, or has happened, but extremely unlikely.  The more moving parts in a cover up, the harder the actual cover up.</p>

<p>The whole thing feels like a giant farce to me.  The MSM will harp on &quot;collusion&quot; until they have you convinced that this is actually an illegal or unusual act.  It is neither.   This is a witch hunt into very normal campaign activities, trying to root out any smidgen of law breaking, something it appears Flynn fell victim to.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wait, wait, wait, it sounds like you&#39;re accusing Susan Rice of spying on Trump and his team.

    <div class="md"><p>With a court order,  the government may seek a court order permitting the surveillance using the FISA court. Approval of a FISA application requires the court find probable cause that the target of the surveillance be a &quot;foreign power&quot; or an &quot;agent of a foreign power&quot;, and that the places at which surveillance is requested is used or will be used by that foreign power or its agent. In addition, the court must find that the proposed surveillance meet certain &quot;minimization requirements&quot; for information pertaining to U.S. persons. Depending on the type of surveillance, approved orders or extensions of orders may be active for 90 days, 120 days, or a year. Thats from wiki, it looks like not being an american is the major requirement. Also some requests are denied at first and changed later so the judge will allow it.</p>

<p>Here again, you&#39;re describing something which did not happen.</p>

<p>There was no justification for &quot;spying on Trump&quot;. Any justification was related to spying on foreigners. That&#39;s why it&#39;s called &quot;incidental collection&quot;.

    <div class="md"><p>That cuts both ways, try this on for size:</p>

<p>The IC gave the information to Rice because the IC knew that it was about the Trump team, and wanted President Obama to have that information. It wasn&#39;t related to national security at all, but was strictly to serve Obama&#39;s political interests.</p>

<p>The point I&#39;m making is that it dangerous--and discrediting--to leap to conclusions.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe Nunes. He&#39;s acted completely improperly and sitting on the damn documents and only he and Trump have seen them. It could be smiley faces on a napkin for all we know.</p>

<p>If they knew it was about the Trump team then it was evidence of a crime because a FISA warrant was issued to monitor the conversation.</p>

<p>I just don&#39;t see a speculation that makes any sense and think its very obvious this is a giant distraction from Trump teams collaboration with a foreign power. That&#39;s getting more and more clear to me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is no evidence that has been presented that she did anything improper. Its not even clear what the allegation even is. Here is a brief rundown of what I&#39;ve read about how this works:
* Intelligence assets surveil foreign conversations and activities.
* Intelligence agencies get these reports back from the field.
* They sift through and decide what they believe and the confidence intervals they have in those beliefs based on the totality of the evidence, including previous surveillances.
* They prioritize the information then deliver it to someone like Dr. Rice.
* This means they&#39;ve already decided its important and she needs to see it or it stays with them.
* Only the foreigner under surveillance is revealed. Any American is &quot;masked&quot;, meaning their identity is kept from her.
* If she feels she needs to know the name for context, she may ask for it to be unmasked to understand what she is reading.
* Example &quot;Russian ambassador spoke with American X about lifting sanctions if candidate y is elected.
* She wants to know who the Russia was talking to and about, because that&#39;s literally her job.</p>

<p>This whole scandal is bullshit manufactured to change the subject from the content of these surveillances which starting to become obvious is very damaging to Trump. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think you understand how silly the accusation is. Its really pathetic and desperate.</p>

<p>You aren&#39;t aware that if she asked for someone to be unmasked, it literally means she didn&#39;t know who it was, so it couldn&#39;t be targeting a political opponent.</p>

<p>And you don&#39;t know that it means that a FISA court approved a warrant, which means they had probably cause to think a crime was happening.</p>

<p>And you don&#39;t know that this further means someone in the intelligence community believed it so important that she be told.</p>

<p>Which means that the intelligence community obtained a warrant because Trump or his associates were thought to be committing crimes and talking about it with Russia for it to get to her at all. All she did was  ask who the hell this Russian was talking to about a crime they were committing.</p>

<p>This is looking really, really bad for Trump. And you are completely buying the sitting government&#39;s story. This is the conspiracy sub. Is that what this sub is about?

    <div class="md"><p>Schiff went to the whitehouse to view the documents on Friday evening.  Here is the confirmation from CNN State of the Union (you can find the transcript if you want):</p>

<p>TAPPER: On Friday, you traveled to the White House to view these documents that Chairman Nunes, your Republican counterpart, has discussed, and Nunes says that they suggest the raising of issues, issues that he has, about incidental surveillance of Trump advisers, maybe even the president, himself. </p>

<p>The president has said he feels somewhat vindicated by what Nunes has said about these documents, although Nunes has said they do not show what the president claimed, the wiretap of Trump at Trump Tower. </p>

<p>But now you have seen these documents, can you understand why Chairman Nunes might have some issues with the surveillance that was going on? </p>

<p>SCHIFF: Well, I can&#39;t go into the contents of the documents, Jake. </p>

<p><strong>I can&#39;t say I don&#39;t agree with the chairman&#39;s characterization</strong>, which is exactly why it&#39;s so important you don&#39;t share documents with just one person or even two people. They need to be shared with both full committees. </p>

<p>He is using clever lawyer speak but the part in bold is the key.  You can reverse a double negative to get the easier to understand meaning of that.  The reverse is: I can say I do agree with the chairman&#39;s characterization.  </p>

<p>The rest of his answer is bitching about the process but there is no argument presented as to the actual content.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The issues are not the incidental surveillance.  The issues are the unmasking of US persons from the incidental surveillance.  The issues include the possibility that the unmasking doesn&#39;t have any legitimate purpose other than political spying.  Those are the issues Nunes has raised.  Nunes has stated on the record that the reports he was reading had nothing to do with Russia and no intelligence value that he could determine.  Therefore why were names unmasked and why do these reports even exist?  </p>

<p>FYI these documents Nunes and Schiff were looking at are Obama&#39;s presidential daily briefings most likely which means Trump may not be too far off base.  If you watch Rice&#39;s interview today with Andrea Mitchell she describes a process which matches exactly with the PDB.</p>

<p>I&#39;m done replying.  Choose to believe whatever you want but I have followed it pretty closely and the information that is currently available indicates that it is extremely likely that surveillance methods were abused for political purposes by members of the Obama admin.  We may never know the full extent and the crazy part is a lot of it was legal (for now).  It will be interesting to see whether or not the agencies are willing to put a few folks in jail to keep their powers because if not then I expect congress to start cracking down on them.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I said I wouldn&#39;t reply but c&#39;mon.  That&#39;s kind of a dumb question.  If it has no intelligence value then why request an unmasking?  In other words Nunes has stated there was information included that had nothing to do with Russia or any other intelligence value.  Probably a conversation with an ambassador to Turkey or something that doesn&#39;t have any particular value.  Why unmask the name?  What possible purpose did she have to request an unmasking?  </p>

<p>Further it gets really easy to figure out which conversations are likely ones involving the incoming administration.  If there are 3 new calls to the Turkish ambassador right after the election from a person that has no previous record of contacting the ambassador it is pretty safe to guess that it was probably a Trump team member.    </p>

<p>The executive branch should not be spying on ANY american without good reason.  This same Obama administration has a history of doing this too.  They spied on reporters.  They even spied on members of Congress.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To be fair,</p>

<p>The NSA and other branches of the IC collect a ton of data, especially on foreign individuals. Imagine a huge database of every phone call with people of importance on foreign soil. An analogy would be Susan Rice going into the database, and searching for names of Trump and Trump associates, and asking for all those conversations to be unmasked. Susan Rice then selectively leaks out conversations across several branches of the US government, some of which inevitably makes it into the news. It should not be this easy to spy on American citizens without a warrant. Dems are hiding under the claim that this was &#39;incidental collection&#39; ie that Trump and team were not the target, but that narrative goes out the window when it becomes clear that names of Trump and associates were asked to be unmasked dozens of times. It effectively appears to be disguised monitoring.</p>

<p>Such an unmasking is normally requested by a law enforcement agency -- in this case, it should have been the FBI. It is shocking that Susan Rice made this request. It is also shocking that, as far as we know, unmasked conversations included conversations not related in any way to Russia. It is also shocking that she apparently made this request dozens of times.</p>

<p>That&#39;s not how this works. That&#39;s not how any of this works. </p>

<p>If she requested a name be unmasked, that means that <em>she did not know who that person was prior to asking</em>. She sees a conversation between a foreign entity and a US person, and is allowed to request that US person&#39;s name be unmasked if it is deemed important to national security. </p>

<p>How could the Obama admin possibly target Trump associates by unmasking their names, when by definition they don&#39;t know who the person is until the name is unmasked?</p>

<p>As far as I have read into the story, and feel free to correct me if I&#39;m wrong conspiracy hivemind, the above comment is correct. She would not have known (except possibly through clear dialog queues in the transcripts) who the US Citizens on the calls were until after requesting them to be unmasked. And more significantly, people keep playing this like it&#39;s somehow vindication for Trump&#39;s &quot;tapp&quot; comments, when really, these calls were made by people dumb enough to contact foreign individuals who were the subject of monitoring before Trump was even in office. They walked into the worlds most obvious spider web, and are now trying to blame the spider for targeting them.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>In this specific case, yes.</p>

<p>Why? Because T_D blatantly states what the sub is all about, if you are not in with the crew you&#39;ll get censored because nobody wants to read that, everybody is circlejerking about how great America is going to be, that sub is not a place for discussion and they are very clear about it.</p>

<p>Now, <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> is disguised as this default sub in which everyone can participate, if they deleted the things they don&#39;t agree with they wouldn&#39;t show to people how bad it is to think like that.</p>

<p>IMO that&#39;s why it&#39;s more dangerous, which is my original statement.</p>

Which is fine, they need a place where they can discuss thier ideas without being derailed by completely opposing ideas.

    <div class="md"><p>There is a huge difference between <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> and T_D. One sub allows open discussion from both sides. Sure there are more liberals on <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>, but they do not ban you for facts. They do not ban you for presenting a conservative point of views. </p>

<p>I dare you. Go on T_D and say you are upset about Trump signing the anti-privacy bill. You will be banned in minutes. Now go on <a href="/r/poltics">/r/poltics</a> and defend the anti-privacy bill using a corporate shill talking point. Like the it&#39;s &quot;same as google facebook&quot; BS. </p>

<p>See the difference?</p>

<p>However, in order to keep up the facade that is fake balance in <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>, they do not ban for dissenting opinion. They just downvote you into oblivion. My lowest rated posts are historically from <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> and number in the -hundreds. </p>

<p>So yeah, you aren&#39;t banned for having a counter opinion. You&#39;re culled with downvotes so your voice isn&#39;t heard regardless. </p>

<p>The end result is the same.</p>

<p>Not even close. I didn&#39;t have to go far to prove you wrong. This discussion about Rice <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/63ebcd/cnns_cuomo_rice_story_is_fake_scandal/dftpyvx/">is taking place over /r/politics.</a> Note how both the left and right are presenting their sides to make their case. This kind of discussion cannot happen in T_D. The Rice defender would be called a shill and banned immediately. </p>

<p>They are NOT this same.</p>

<p>Can you share those with me? I went back a year and couldn&#39;t find any comment with more than -14  let alone -100s.  I&#39;d honestly much rather have my comment down voted rather than deleted right away.</p>

<p>At least I know my opinion was read by as many people I&#39;m down voted by. Which is the entire point of making a comment. If you&#39;re  worried about how many points you&#39;ll get then you&#39;re doing it wrong as this leads to people saying whatever they think other want to hear rather than what they believe. </p>

<p>Being banned is the worst possible punishment when you want your opinion to be heard. It completely censors you for good </p>

<p>I should add I don&#39;t like either of their practices but not against them existing. I would like if they stayed three and didn&#39;t brigade other subreddits and pretend to be victims. </p>

<p>And also people like to pretend that /politics has some much greater power and user base when in reality The Donald is second in daily traffic which gives it an enormous amount of influence.</p>

<p>Couple that with their strict rules and instant bans, you can control any message you want.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is patently false. I was banned from politics (right after the new mods came in) for making <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/548uu1/fbi_docs_obama_used_pseudonym_to_email_hillarys/d7zxzv6/">this anti-Hillary comment</a>. I know many other former top politics commentators that were banned for seemingly innocuous reasons right around then too. Maybe they don&#39;t ban anymore, but they removed practically every top anti-establishment commentor from that sub a month before the election.</p>

<p>There was a unhappy pedes in there who were trying to delicately express their unhappiness at the situation without getting banned themselves.</p>

<p>It&#39;s all fun and games until that shit begins to affect you  personally. Then you realize just how shitty it is to not be able to defend yourself at all and have to make a decsion to either compromise your integrity and go with it or take a stand for what you believe in.</p>

<p>There were at least 50 different comments at the time questioning themselves and having a a difficult time accepting it. </p>

<p>The others quickly switched gears and proffeseed how they never liked the bitch to begin with and knew all along how bad she was. These are the shills.</p>

<p>They spend a year praising someone and continuing the circlejerk until that person says one thing they don&#39;t like. Then they become public enemy number one within minutes. </p>

<p>When these things happen more and more people snap out of it and realize how crazy it is and cracks begin to grow larger in the community. Eventually they will split up leaving behind the most loyal and rabid fans and shills. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d turn off all karma in political subs and have the votes hidden. That would greatly reduce the ones there simply to circlejerk and farm karma imo. These are the places to get quick comment and link karma for accounts intended for sale. </p>

<p>I always see hundreds of memes and other low effort comments posted over and over in big threads there. It gives the illusion of a lot of activity when in reality there is very little substance. </p>

<p>Unfortunately the people there who are willing to discuss it with your are drowned out by the noise. They also get ostracized for simply posting there rather than on the content of their comments. </p>

<p>It&#39;s happened to me firsthand in this sub. Someone insinuated I was a TD shill because I simply made a few comments there. However when I asked them to provide a comment with me supporting him they never answered.</p>

<p>Susan Rice makes a statement about an ongoing event where circumstances are, at best, murky. SHE LIED!</p>

<p>Donald Trump repeats verifiably false claims about things that never happened (people dancing in the streets on 9/11, Obama was not born in the US). Well gosh, that&#39;s just what he believes!</p>

<p>&quot;Bowling Green massacre&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Germany owes ... vast sums of money to NATO &amp; the United States must be paid more for the powerful, and very expensive, defense it provides to Germany!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The murder rate in our country is the highest it’s been in 47 years.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I have already saved more than $700 million when I got involved in the negotiation on the F-35.&quot;</p>

<p>Terrorism and terrorist attacks in the United States and Europe have &quot;gotten to a point where it&#39;s not even being reported.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Here in Philadelphia murder has been steady — I mean — just terribly increasing.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That was the largest audience to witness an inauguration, period.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We had a massive landslide victory, as you know, in the Electoral College.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There was &#39;serious voter fraud&#39; in Virginia.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;There was &#39;serious voter fraud&#39; in New Hampshire.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There was &#39;serious voter fraud&#39; in California.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The @nytimes sent a letter to their subscribers apologizing for their BAD coverage of me.&quot;</p>

<p>Says that at a campaign rally President Barack Obama &quot;spent so much time screaming at a protester, and frankly it was a disgrace.&quot;</p>

<p>Says Hillary Clinton &quot;wants to let people just pour in. You could have 650 million people pour in and we do nothing about it. Think of it. That’s what could happen. You triple the size of our country in one week.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Wikileaks also shows how John Podesta rigged the polls by oversampling Democrats, a voter suppression technique.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;14 percent of noncitizens are registered to vote.&quot;  </p>

<p>All simple to verify as lies told by Trump (except one was from Conway and one from Spicer). And that&#39;s just from the first 5 pages, of 28: <a href="http://www.politifact.com/personalities/donald-trump/statements/">http://www.politifact.com/personalities/donald-trump/statements/</a></p>

<p>Never said vote tallies were changed...<em>that&#39;s</em> the only strawman here LOL. Is there any proof Russia influenced a single vote in the election? e.g. changing one person&#39;s mind?</p>

<p>Since you have a bad habit of using words you don&#39;t know the meaning of, here&#39;s a couple more fallacies from your last post:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&#39;t think you know what a strawman is.</p>

<p>Personal Incredulity: saying that because one finds something difficult to understand that it&#39;s therefore not true.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Possibly intentionally spying on Americans via bogus FISA warrants, possibly unmasking inappropriately, possibly warrantless search for Trump associates via FISA network of data, possibly leaking information she found via all or some of the above. I think that all covers it.</p>

<p>There should be an ultra high standard for unmasking Americans (something that rises to level of criminality). If they had that, Trump would not be sitting in the White House most likely. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not saying the are, bogus, as you pointed out, that&#39;s why I&#39;m using the word &quot;possibly.&quot; All I&#39;m saying is that would need to be looked into in any investigation. The problem with FISA is that it basically rubber stamps everything because they aren&#39;t US citizens. So there is a very, very low standard to get FISA warrants. All you would have to do is get a warrant for a foreigner that you knew Trump was in regular contact with to spy on him. Again, not saying that happened, saying that is one of the questions being raised. </p>

If they suspected Trump or his people of anything they should have used normal channels to spy on his people.

And for what reason did rice have to unmask the people who spoke to people with FISA warrants? Are you seriously gonna tell me that none of the 3 letter agency&#39;s suspected that these people with FISA warrants didnt have any ties to Tumps people?

    <div class="md"><p>OP, in the off chance you want to learn anything today:</p>

<p>Susan Rice never had the power to unilaterally order an identity to be unmasked. Because there are privacy concerns with such actions, this runs through a legal process which involves all non-political career national security professionals and lawyers.</p>

<p>The only way she could have obtained unmasking (if she did) is if the non-political career professionals determined that it was (A) vital to understanding the intelligence, or (B) implied that the U.S. person was complicit in some espionage or criminal wrongdoing.</p>

<p>Were Donald&#39;s friends complicit in espionage or criminal wrongdoing? Because that&#39;s what you&#39;re implying by posting that Trump team members were unmasked. So by all means, keep pushing this narrative.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There Trump Russian connection doesn&#39;t rest on some meeting Obama orchestrated. There are deep ties between Trump&#39;s team and Russian officials. It came up in investigations because our intelligence agencies routinely investigate our adversaries. Russia interfered in our election, so it makes sense they&#39;d be investigated by our intelligence agencies. No smoking gun has been made public that definitively links the Trump administration with Russia, but there are an unusual number of connections. Quite a bit of smoke for there to not be a fire. That&#39;s why they can&#39;t shake the story.</p>

<p>The problem with your story is that it discounts the very real investigations going on as frivolity invented by Obama and ignores everything that points to there actually being something there. Just because Chaffetz used his position with the oversight committee in a shamefully partisan way doesn&#39;t mean virtually all of our intelligence agencies are doing the same thing.</p>

<p>The very same investigations that both Clapper and Comey have said turned up no evidence of collusion? The very same investigations that caused Schiff to come out on Sunday and say they have seen no definitive proof of collusion between Trump&#39;s team and Russia, after he got done saying a few days before hand about how they had a &quot;smoking gun&quot;? </p>

<p>Is that the investigation you&#39;re talking about? At some point, you have to cut your losses and walk away. When everything says &quot;there&#39;s nothing here&quot;, you don&#39;t keep digging because you <em>feel</em> like there might be something. Sometimes there&#39;s nothing. </p>

<p>Obama had phone calls, emails, and literal spreadsheets of information about Trump and his team&#39;s interactions with Russia. Nothing has come from that (from the mouths of the very people doing the investigation). If there was anything there, it would have been known long before Trump was even allowed to win the nomination (the wiretapping started before that, remember). </p>

<p>But I get it, you want to hate Trump and you want to hate Russia. It&#39;s like a perfect marriage for you. A word of wisdom for you: You can dislike Trump, and think he&#39;ll be a bad president, without needing the Russian conspiracy. It <em>is</em> possible for you to recognize it for the farce that it is, while still believing Trump was a mistake. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Did you take this stance on the Benghazi hearings?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After over a year of everybody saying &quot;it&#39;s nothing&quot;, yes I did. I still believe it was something, but the law makers have spoken. It got to a point where it was just wasting time and money. And so I dropped it. But at least with Benghazi we had actual evidence.</p>

<p>I&#39;m at that point with this Russian shit. We have <em>literally</em> nothing to show for it after a year. There would be something to show for it if there was anything. We would, at a minimum, not see people who once beat the Russian drum change their tunes. And, if not, that would mean our intelligence community is incompetent, at which point I wouldn&#39;t believe what they say nor would I trust their investigation. </p>

<p>Why do we continue to waste our time, money, and effort investigating something that over a year of wiretaps, server spying, etc has turned up <em>nothing</em>? It&#39;s time to cut our losses and move on. </p>

<p>Even <em>if</em> Trump is a Putin &quot;pawn&quot;, he&#39;s done the opposite of behave that way. Hell, he sent his UN lady to tell Russia to cut their shit more than once. And he wouldn&#39;t be able to act on it anyways -- the country has (and would have) such a happy trigger finger. </p>

<p>So, again, why do we continue to hold up our government investigating something that&#39;s turned up <em>literally</em> nothing? Why are you okay with your money being spent on something that, thus far, has been a complete failure (at least in terms of the stated goals -- which is to find evidence of collusion)? </p>

<p>And, most importantly, why does all this suddenly make you okay with the government spying on political opponents, unmasking them, and then using that information for their own gains (news flash: these leaks existed BEFORE Trump took office. Same with the Flynn info. They sat on it to do maximum harm to Trump)?</p>

<p>Not in the way that you&#39;ve represented it so far.  I&#39;m taking my time going through every single citation, but the first two appear to be misrepresentations or faulty assertions.  I&#39;ll edit my original reply to you as I move through as I could be wrong, but this is my first impression.</p>

<p>Again, my main contention was about the &quot;burden of proof&quot;, but if someone was making assertions about a subject that they&#39;ve no knowledge of... there&#39;s definitely an issue.</p>

<p>In this specific case, yes.</p>

<p>Why? Because T_D blatantly states what the sub is all about, if you are not in with the crew you&#39;ll get censored because nobody wants to read that, everybody is circlejerking about how great America is going to be, that sub is not a place for discussion and they are very clear about it.</p>

<p>Now, <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> is disguised as this default sub in which everyone can participate, if they deleted the things they don&#39;t agree with they wouldn&#39;t show to people how bad it is to think like that.</p>

<p>IMO that&#39;s why it&#39;s more dangerous, which is my original statement.</p>

<p>One thing I can say about this is that Snopes is very carefyl about how they respond to anything. If they cannot debunk it they usually debunk something else with tricky wording making it sound like they are referring to the question, when really they pulled a fast one on the reader.</p>

<p>I wish I had the example that usually gets passed around for this, but I don&#39;t think there are as many situations where you can outright say they were wrong, just that they conveniently avoided addressing the actual issue.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wait, wait, wait, it sounds like you&#39;re accusing Susan Rice of spying on Trump and his team. That&#39;s a bit of a stretch given that foreigners were targeted by FISA warrants and those targets happened to be discussing Trump or in contact with Trump officials. We&#39;re calling that &quot;spying on Trump and his team&quot; now?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t have any real way to assess whether the &quot;unmasking&quot; is a big deal. The hysteria over at T_D makes me suspect that this is a rather routine part of an investigation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>this is what the Republicans always do. They did it with Benghazi, they did it with Eric Holder. They find something that is not illegal or even particularly problematic, but that is nonetheless complex. </p>

<p>They trust that their supporters aren&#39;t intelligent enough to understand the nuance or else won&#39;t bother trying to understand. &quot;Incidental collection, FISA warrants, unmasking, what is all that?&quot;</p>

<p>So the Republicans just wave their arms and shout and use words like &quot;Freedom,&quot; &quot;Obama,&quot; &quot;smoking gun,&quot; &quot;bombshell,&quot; &quot;unprecedented!,&quot; and &quot;cover up&quot; and their base just goes along with it, because they hate Obama and want it to be true.</p>

<p>What Rice is accused of doing (and likely did do) isn&#39;t illegal. It isn&#39;t surprising. It isn&#39;t interesting. And it isn&#39;t bad. If you want to have a high level policy discussion about how to balance privacy rights under the current intelligence gathering framework? Cool. Let&#39;s do that. But don&#39;t pretend this is an issue when you didn&#39;t give a fuck for the last sixteen years since you guys wrote and adopted the Patriot Act and then reauthorized it over and over.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Answers to your questions:</p>

<p>1) Flynn talked to the Russian ambassador who is under surveillance (do I have to explain how this means Flynns conversation with him is recorded?) -&gt; perhaps in investigating the Russian election influence, rice or someone else requested to unmask the US person in these intercepts -&gt; that request was granted and the unmasked transcripts were given to that person where they were then distributed throughout the intelligence community. I&#39;m not exactly sure of the mechanism for that but it seems it could have been as part of the Russia meddling documents or a more secret thing limited to certain people in the IC community.</p>

<p>Let me know if any of this doesn&#39;t make sense or if you have any refutations.</p>

<p>2) People have been saying that trumps outbursts or allegations about being wire tapped have been smokescreen to distract from his teams Russia connections. I don&#39;t disagree with them. When you say it&#39;s insane based on the imbalance of evidence I assume you must believe that you are aware of all evidence in both cases, which clearly none of us are. The investigation is still ongoing, right? Not to mention that the two aren&#39;t mutually exclusive. Trump could fully have been illegally spied on and it could also still be a smokescreen/distraction.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t use the term, schiff did. I&#39;m not aware of all of the evidence in the case and neither are you. </p>

<p>I quite frankly don&#39;t know what&#39;s being investigated. I think it&#39;s entirely possible that new evidence has come to light since clapper left. I don&#39;t know and neither do you. Are you not going to address the fact that coordination short of collusion could have happened? Or another crime? I don&#39;t know the details of the still ongoing investigation, do you?</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure you were super respectful of Obama. How did you show your respect for him? Why would I respect a president who said we should never and that the country could never withstand having a president under investigation by the FBI, who at that time and still to this day is under his own FBI investigation? Who stiffs every day contractors, cleaners, and other service providers? Who blasts a president for playing golf when he&#39;s on a pace to play far more rounds? Who said he&#39;d never leave the White House because he&#39;d be working too hard but goes on vacation every week on taxpayer money? Who&#39;s wife won&#39;t live in the whitehouse, costing taxpayers millions? who&#39;s national security advisor resigned in disgrace and now it turns out also didn&#39;t disclose his work representing foreign nations? who won&#39;t divest from his businesses when they clearly benefit from his position and from foreigners? Who can never admit being wrong? Who can&#39;t stop tweeting?</p>

<p>I&#39;ve had comments with less offensive name calling than yours removed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No naivety required. If the FBI is eavesdropping on a criminal and I happen to speak with that criminal on the phone, should I really be surprised if my voice is recorded? What if the NSA is eavesdropping on a spy.</p>

<p>The fact that you&#39;re incapable of arguing your point without resorting to straw men and hyperbole says a lot about your ability to process this information. T_D, like the big orange con man, preys on gullible rubes like you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We know that&#39;s obviously not the case as members of his team have resigned. So they were definitely in contact with foreign agents who were under investigation and they considered whatever they talked about bad enough to resign. </p>

<p>If it was simply the weather they would&#39;ve  stayed on the team and gladly released the conversation themselves. </p>

<p>Believing that they were monitored for no reason is delusional at this point. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Regardless what happened I can guarantee you no former president is going to jail. Obama ordered an airstrike that killed an American citizen ffs. </p>

<p>Those scenarios you provided are like littering. Even Nixon avoided going to jail. Trust me they look out for their own first. Just like how Hillary is in jail even though Trump made his entire campaign about her.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2017/04/02/adam_schiff_there_is_no_definitive_proof_of_any_trump-russia_connection.html">Here&#39;s</a> Schiff&#39;s statements on video. He never says he can&#39;t comment on existing evidence. In fact, it&#39;s pathetically clear that they have uncovered nothing thus far. Good luck to them LOL</p>

<p>To a larger point, what evidence is there that Russia changed <em>one vote</em> in the 2016 Presidential Election? If you can&#39;t prove this, then why does contact with Russians even matter?</p>
