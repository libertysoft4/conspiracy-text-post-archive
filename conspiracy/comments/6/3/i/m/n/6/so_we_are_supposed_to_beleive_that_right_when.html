<p>The alarming thing is that Rex Tillerson is accusing Assad &quot;loyalists&quot; of carrying out the attack. So much for an american reset on Syria. Once again we are at two minutes to midnight. We have Tillerson ready to start wars with China (via north Korea) and Russia (via syria) at the same time!!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah.  I mean, I&#39;ve felt sort of the same way too, that things are coming to critical mass or &quot;shit&#39;s getting weird&quot;, feelings like that.  I&#39;ve sort of waved them off because I&#39;m a college student going through a phase in my life where I learn a lot of new things and have a lot of perspective widening.  I don&#39;t want to make the mistake of thinking things are all coming to a head in my lifetime just because I wasn&#39;t alive to witness how mad the world has always felt.  I&#39;m sure people have always felt like everything is reaching a fever pitch or something like that (&quot;the world&#39;s going mad!&quot;).  That&#39;s why to hear your perspective of being wide awake for decades and thinking something is different these days is interesting to me.  I shouldn&#39;t reject the idea that there are major shifts throughout history and that one is happening right now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is a really honest way of looking at it. And, I can&#39;t say it is not as you say. I have been around a little longer though, and never seen things screwed up to the pitch they are right now. The media has always added to the general feeling of alarm, but we have adjusted to normal doses of that. I dunno, I feel like the world is running around like chicken with its head cut off right now. No one really knows what is going on, especially the ones pretending like they do haha. I don&#39;t think anyone anticipated this presidency. It is having a great chaotic effect, no matter what side you are on. And we aren&#39;t used to the lack of control being exercised by TPTB as it is now. Maybe that is the feeling, the horses are off the reins.  </p>

<p>Maybe it&#39;s because the people running the show are too old and don&#39;t understand how the internet works.

NYC almost faced a collapse, banks agreed to bail them out in return for a private commission controlled by them to control city finance (the early precursor to the &#39;emergency managers&#39; in Michigan). They realized it worked extremely well in their favor, and rolled it out nation wide, but in private. A private multinational controlling the finance of the city gets all final decisions on whether policy can pass or not. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My take on global Illuminati kind of thing was always that it is a group of extremely influential people who sometimes happen to work together to hold on to their position, because if they don&#39;t everything falls apart for everyone. Imagine if somebody stops giving a fuck and just goes public with it. It&#39;s going to be a huge and bloody mess. So basically, these are people that do everything to stay in the shadows, everybody wants to remain where one&#39;s at right now, so they cooperate, compete and do whatever just to keep stuff as it is</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It didn&#39;t prove you wrong at all. These are all planned, and their plan went through without a hitch.</p>

<p>The goal of the globalist power (which is different than the globalist people / culture that people like to shit on), is to remove politicians from the equation. These are the multinational banks, the ones that can determine politics by how they decide to move money. (HyperNormalisation)[<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fny99f8amM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fny99f8amM</a>] explains some of this, including what has happened to iraq / syria / iran in the past few decades. </p>

<p>The real globalist powers are the ones putting up the anti-&#39;globalist&#39; propaganda right now. They depend on the ability to have factions fight each other. That keeps them needing money, and keeps them under the global banks control. </p>

<p>A person who opens up hotels worldwide is a globalist. Their goal is to attack &#39;globalism&#39; to prevent new people from entering their power structure. </p>

<p>The fact that people though Clinton was the one backed by the shadow power boggles my mind. They&#39;re trying to &#39;correct&#39; the direction Bill Clinton (Who half played their game) &amp; Obama have put us on, by electing someone outside of politics. The news now isn&#39;t even covering the politics, it isn&#39;t covering decisions outside of outrage - it&#39;s covering personality. </p>

<p>That has been their goal all along.</p>

<p>People don&#39;t understanding global power and global culture are two different, opposing things, and global power has been pushing people to get angry and pay attention to the culture side, while ignoring the power side.</p>

Cultures are shaped by the powers to have conflicting ideals and then used as a divisive tool to advance agenda. They are very much intertwined. But more importantly, considering you are half awake, its very naive to even for one moment think that Hilary Rodham Clinton was NOT backed by the establishment forces. That&#39;s not to say Trump has no puppet strings attached. Stop buying into the farce of political parties and the illusion of choice and accept that no matter who won -  the only reason they got there is because the deep state globalists said so.</p>

<p>That&#39;s how they are opposed though - without the conflicting ideas, there would be no way to get the agenda across. The internet itself was so dangerous to them because it allowed people to find out people across the world have the same needs and wants as them, instead of being &#39;scary foreigners&#39;.</p>

<p>This has little to do with the political parties themselves, it has to do with how they come into power. HRC is not clean, though she&#39;s not as dirty as people want to make her out to be either. The problem is she has the connections around the deep state to do what she wanted. The favors to call in. </p>

<p>This election was an experiment to put someone in power with no qualifications. No experience with constituents. No history to fall back on, no knowledge to question the orders they sign,  a blank, Manchurian candidate slate. Offer him into their club, and they do all the heavy lifting. I guarantee Trump has no illegal ties to Russia, the people assigned to him all do (and it has nothing to do with Russia being the <em>bad guy</em>, and everything to do with it being easier to hide this kind of stuff in). Putin is a spectacle - the first attempt at a Trump character by them. The problem was he had the military background and that lets him have a bit more sway in decisions than they like. The next step was to do it again, but with someone who won&#39;t question orders. Trump does not have any favors to call. He doesn&#39;t have the connections or advisors to steer him. </p>

<p>Trump spends his time alone - his family isn&#39;t there to ask him why he did things. he spends his weekends receiving orders form the higher ups who meet him where he&#39;s comfortable - Mir a Lago - why do you think there are no visitor logs? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Assad&#39;s or his military using poison gas to attack a hospital full of civilians just because they are bad people is beyond illogical. </p>

<p>Makes no sense. But a false flag makes a lot of sense, especially in light of recent development on the side of the Trump administration that are at odds with the international &quot;liberal&quot; war party. Moreover, the m.o. is the same as the war party continually uses to create a narrative on demand.</p>

<p>There are essentially three possibilities.</p>

<p>The first is that Assad and his army are depraved criminals bent on committing war crimes in broad daylight. Implausible.</p>

<p>The second is a false flag targeted at Assad and his government. Highly plausible.</p>

<p>The third is that Assad&#39;s air force hit a target that they had identified as a terrorist position. However, it turned out to be a depot for terrorists weapons that included chemical weapons and the hit dispersed the chemicals. There is some evidence to suggest that this may have been what happened. </p>

<p>An iteration of the third is that two and three are related. The terrorists could have positioned the chemical weapons to be hit by the Syrian AF with the knowledge that this would create the appearance of the chemicals being used from the aircraft.</p>

<p>Another matter that is highly suspicious is that Western governments and media immediately jumped to the conclusion that &quot;Assad did it,&quot; and that was fed into the echo chamber right way.</p>

<p>Another issue, as the article in The Duran observes, is the involvement of the White Helmets in the propaganda effort.</p>

<p>Why am I so cynical about this. I was serving in the military when the Vietnam War was just heating up and was deployed in the US Navy at the time of the Gulf of Tonkin incident. I came to know during the time I was on active duty that the Vietnam War was cooked up for reasons other than those that were being used to sell the public and the people in the military at the time.</p>

<p>The Gulf of Tonkin was a classic false flag but that was actually only a minor aspect of the selling of the war on false pretenses — liberal interventionism and R2P. The actual reasons were very different and are the same reasons that dictated US policy post-WWII, namely achieving permanent global hegemony. While the narrative was that this was about promoting democracy, it was really about promoting capitalism as the guarantor of Atlanticist supremacy under the &quot;leadership of the US.&quot;</p>

<p>Since then I have come to see that this is a pattern. Chomsky wrote a book on it called &quot;Manufacturing Consent.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Probably Turkey, if it was a false flag. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not the US, since Spicer already said &quot;political realities&quot; mean that USA will not pursue ousting Assad. US isn&#39;t going to get involved. Besides Trump tweeted after the &#39;red line&#39; was crossed that Obama should not get involved.</p>

<p>Turkey has the capability and motive for this.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The first is that Assad and his army are depraved criminals bent on committing war crimes in broad daylight. Implausible.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hmm .. or Assad just wants to break the rebels with any means necessary. He made the assessment (with Kremlins help) that Trump wasn&#39;t going to do shit, in which case he was right. Trumps press secretary said as much.</p>

<p>But are chemical weapons even that good? Why not just use conventional bombs? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>He could do that with conventional weapons, no need to use chemical ones when Assad has already been framed for using chemical weapons in the past and this was used as the reason to sell the war in Syria to the American people. Is he suddenly going to turn around and do the exact same thing they want him to do, and therefore open himself up to the prospect of being ousted again?

Because it&#39;s easier and eliminates more people in a specific area than, say, conventional bombs.  Chemical weapons don&#39;t destroy buildings and cities either, just the populations within.  Conventional weapons are not nearly as powerful. </p>

Go to 21st Century Wire on Syria, they&#39;re the global authority in my books work8ng with reporters in the field in Syria.

    <div class="md"><p>Its a shadow war in Syria.  The US is at war with IS, and will go wherever IS is to fight them.  Somehow IS always showed up around crucial Assad infrastructure that we then bombed to rubble.  We used that to tip the balance to the Syrian rebels.  Obama, tried to go to war with Syria, but failed, so the shadow war continued.  Russia came in and spoiled years of Obama scheming.</p>

<p>After that  Obama tried to bait Putin into doing something stupid to give the US reason to retaliate, to no avail.  The main problem here is that the US is has been using the same playbook since WW2, and everyone is wise to it.  We have lots of technology, but very little strategy.</p>

<p>The war with Korea never ended, its a cease fire that has lasted five decades.  So no hoop jumping is required.  I&#39;m sure the subject will come up when Xi meets with Trump.  If China backs North Korea strongly, war won&#39;t happen.  The US needs a war though and will find a way to get one before the next election.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m interested in how Trump handles this. If we rush off to war and throw up a no fly zone before any investigation, I&#39;ll consider my vote wasted. Trump must understand, a large issue for many voters was to resist being drawn into wars in the Middle East. The screeching sirens from the neocons and neoliberal are at full blast right now. Tillerson / Trump don&#39;t seem to be on the same page. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s intentional or disorganization. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. So many things at play right now. Really hard to get through all the noise.</p>

<p>I admittedly have not been a supporter of Trump in any way. But that doesn&#39;t mean he can&#39;t do things that I like. I definitely hope he does them. Like end the wars. If he does things like that I will be the first to admit he&#39;s done good. </p>

<p>I felt the same about Obama. I understand we&#39;ll probably never get the perfect president/government, but I can still admit when they&#39;ve done good things or at least tried.</p>

<p>Believe me, I def hope Trump does good even though I haven&#39;t supported him. I just don&#39;t know if it&#39;s possible though. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What if this was a rebel-held stockpile detonating by accident or enemy action?  Ah, and there it is in the article.  That&#39;s exactly what Russia claimed happened.  Here&#39;s an excerpt <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/04/05/522726068/experts-suspect-nerve-agent-was-used-in-syrian-attack">and a hyperlink</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Russian government has claimed the chemicals were released after Syrian government forces hit a rebel chemical depot. Kaszeta says that&#39;s doubtful because nerve agents are unstable and are typically stored as two separate chemicals. With sarin, for example, one of those precursor chemicals is highly flammable isopropyl alcohol.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Gee, because rebels never store chemicals unsafely, that&#39;s not plausible at all...  Oh, and look, flammability!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Kaszeta says it&#39;s the strongest evidence of an attack using nerve agent since an August 2013 strike on a Damascus suburb that killed hundreds of people. After that incident, President Bashar Assad&#39;s regime was pressured into surrendering more than 1,000 tons of chemicals to international observers.</p>

This guy probably didn&#39;t even lose any of his family. What a loser. Sad! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m interested in how Trump handles this. If we rush off to war and throw up a no fly zone before any investigation, I&#39;ll consider my vote wasted. Trump must understand, a large issue for many voters was to resist being drawn into wars in the Middle East. The screeching sirens from the neocons and neoliberal are at full blast right now. Tillerson / Trump don&#39;t seem to be on the same page. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s intentional or disorganization. </p>

<p>Who am I kidding, if it makes Russia look bad it&#39;s a false flag and if it brings sympathy to Russia it&#39;s legit. That&#39;s all the thought you put into it...</p>

With an easing of tensions between Russia and the USA and a new harmony over battling ISIS, it may appear that there is a window wherein the international repercussions are suspended.</p>
