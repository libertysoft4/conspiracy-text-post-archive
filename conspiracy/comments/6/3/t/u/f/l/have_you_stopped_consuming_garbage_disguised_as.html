    <div class="md"><p>What exactly are you arguing for here? That people should just blindly ingest chemical compounds? Most benificial things for the body don&#39;t have long complex names as they have been given short hand or colloquial names because they are common. New compounds made in labs don&#39;t have that because they are newly created and generally just a remake of something found natually.</p>
