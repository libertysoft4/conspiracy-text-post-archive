<p>Another Trump/Russia post.</p>

<p>Top comments bashing r/conspiracy as a sub and calling everyone here pro trump</p>

<p>Just because the media calls it a conspiracy doesn&#39;t mean that r/conspiracy has to subscribe to it. If anything it&#39;s just like the last MSM <em>conspiracies</em> that end up being fake/propaganda bull shit.</p>

<p>Look at the narrative. If it fits with the MSMs narrative, it likely needs a second look. There probably is a conspiracy in there somewhere.</p>

<p>Now I know these times are dark days and people are hurting and losing hope that all of human consciousness will never be unified by Orbital Mind Control Satellites operated by NRO into simultaneously thinking the same a thought on the same wavelength , a Great Thought expressing Humanity&#39;s most noble potential, the Final Answer to All Problens,: when will someone make First Contact with Alien Intelligences and learn how to operate the GUI of the HyperDimensional Glowing Orbs and thereby become fluent in the Archillean language to be able to communicate to them and ask them when will anyone investigate Pizzagate when there&#39;s no one left to ask? </p>

<p>Before the election this sub was fairly balanced, but the Russian bots or paid trolls owned this place during the election. It was wall to wall &quot;Clinton foundation busted for pediphia&quot; or &quot;Pope Endorced Trump&quot;. 9 out of 10 top stories where Pro-Trump/Anti-Hillary.</p>

<p>Now that Trump has showed his true colors, by taking away our privacy. Now that we saw he tried to take health insurance from 24 Million Americans. Now that we see he filled his cabinet with corrupt lobbyist, the sub has balanced out a bit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Like Rand Paul, the one who cosponsored the bill to get rid of privacy regulations? Though he&#39;s not really a full libertarian. I agree with fuck the 2 major political parties, but libertiarianism, at least the common form I see touted online, would never work. Regulations on capitalism are necessary so the little people don&#39;t get fucked. Most libertarians I know are just angry at the government and taxes, so think that the best solution is to throw the baby out with the bathwater. They seem to glorify big corporations, when corporations are just as corrupt as the government has become. They are the funders of politicians.</p>

<p>Regardless, we&#39;re getting fucked by the two parties, and being unable to actually form other viable parties is severely hampering any positive changes we could make to the system.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you, the two party system is broken and both sides have every intention of tossing you down. I love this idea that PizzaGate is somehow just attacking Democrats when you have the Bush Callboy Story and the Larry King story mentioned, yet that will get downvoted because &quot;it&#39;s just the Democrats that are being attacked&quot;. The truth of the matter is that they want to turn this partisan rather then acknowledge both sides are corrupt and guilty. </p>

<p>There is a concentrated effort to turn this sub into a right wing Neo Nazi group and I have no doubt that there are those on both left and right who are posing as &quot;the other&quot; to change the perception on things here, especially since this is one of the few places where not only can you be critical of both left and right, but there is credible fact based information that can be viewed here and is damaging to the narrative. That is why we are being attacked by both the left and right.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like how when the Democrats don&#39;t play by the rules, the media is always fine and dandy with it: Obama engages in outrages Nixon never dared to, and . . .</p>

<p>Pffft! So what?</p>

<p>Hillary gets the questions to the debate beforehand and cheats, and . . .</p>

<p>Look over there! A new article on the Kardashians!</p>

<p>It&#39;s disgusting. Because all the lawlessness and corruption they&#39;re attributing to Trump is actually the DNC. It&#39;s so sickening, this inversion of reality. </p>

<p>The Democrats keep lying, cheating and breaking the law. But the media&#39;s narrative is that it&#39;s Trump who&#39;s bad.</p>

<p>WTF!</p>
