<p>&quot;Carl Sagan once wrote a controversial paper that was funded by a NASA research grant. In what is now known as the Sagan Stanford papers—and originally known by the title of “Direct Contact Among Galactic Civilizations by Relativistic Interstellar Spaceflight” and published in 1962—Carl Sagan concludes that intervention from an ancient and advanced civilization may have sparked the current Human genome. In other terms, Carl believed it was probable that an extraterrestrial civilization created human beings as we are today.</p>

<p>Our guest today—on the alternative to Coast to Coast AM, in podcast format—is Donald Zygutis and Don lays claim that NASA has not only worked hard to suppressed Carl Sagan’s message of ancient aliens but that the organization is also heavily influenced by decision makers of the pentagon.&quot;</p>

<p>Well, as long as profit is more important than all other things, then yes, everything we do as a species turns to shit. But it doesn&#39;t have to be like that nor is it an inevitable conclusion of our existence. We just have to do something about the psychotic hoarders that currently run things (the super rich). I think they need an intervention.</p>

<p>I mean, if we&#39;re getting into the alien part, one could argue that self-destruction comes more from interference/manipulation of certain ETs and genetic tinkering. There is the flip side that we are just as benevolent and loving as we are greedy and hateful. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I actually enjoyed the one with Krauss, though I agree with you that he is probably too smart for his own good, lol. He was trying to dumb down an incredibly complicated subject for the audience and Joe, so I gave him a lot of slack.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s a few off the top of my head. I don&#39;t like much of the comedians he has except Burr/Stanhope, and really dislike Brian Callen and Co. having bro-downs about UFC bullshit. I stick to the types of people below (other than Hancock and Carlson)</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Michael Ruppert</strong>- Freelance journalist, former cop. Spoke out against tyranny, corruption, etc. Sadly, he committed suicide.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sam Harris</strong>- Always interesting, but overcomplicates things sometimes just to be an intellectual.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>NDT</strong>- Can&#39;t go wrong there. Probably Joe&#39;s favorite guest.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Steven Greer</strong>- I think he&#39;s batshit nuts and an opportunist, but fun nonetheless.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Les Stroud</strong>- I think Joe pissed him off, but it was a decent episode.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Abby Martin</strong>- Hot as hell, smart.</p></li>
<li><p>Henry Rollins- A bit full of himself, but wicked sharp.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Shane Smith</strong>- Always fun, no matter what he&#39;s talking about. Smart, but doesn&#39;t give a fuck all at once. (you wanna have a beer with this guy)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Brian Cox</strong>- Physicist. 49 years old, but looks and talks like a 19yr old. His passion is infectious.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>It&#39;s also worth noting that Joe seems to have gotten away from some mainline conspiracy stuff (yes, even though Alex Jones was on). I think he wants to appear more legitimate and is really careful about what he says these days. What he thinks to himself, who knows. But that&#39;s my take anyways.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Read it! It is quite a good book with solid wisdom. Sagan doesn&#39;t get nearly as much credit as he should.</p>

<p>Well, as long as profit is more important than all other things, then yes, everything we do as a species turns to shit. But it doesn&#39;t have to be like that nor is it an inevitable conclusion of our existence. We just have to do something about the psychotic hoarders that currently run things (the super rich). I think they need an intervention.</p>

<p>I would agree with that self-destructive part. We can even view it in the micro-sense. Everything we touch goes to shit.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I mean, if we&#39;re getting into the alien part, one could argue that self-destruction comes more from interference/manipulation of certain ETs and genetic tinkering. There is the flip side that we are just as benevolent and loving as we are greedy and hateful. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Errr, that&#39;s objectively false, religious traditions are incredibly diverse across cultures.  Basic similarities like &quot;the gods came from the sky and brought us wisdom!&quot; don&#39;t constitute evidence that aliens visited our ancestors.  You should read the Sagan paper posted in this thread, and then you should read the book that a few others have mentioned, &quot;The Demon-Haunted World&quot; by Sagan.</p>
