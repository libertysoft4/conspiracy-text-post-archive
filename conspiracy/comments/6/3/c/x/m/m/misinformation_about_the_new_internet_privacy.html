        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>There is a lot of misinformation being spread about the new internet privacy bill. I wanted to make this post to inform people so they could read it all, and come to their own informed opinion on the matter. My intent is to just inform people.. and let them come to their own decision. </p>

<p>I found a good ELI5 of this (of stuff I already researched), and was really happy too.. because finally I could make a post, that would allow people to fully understand it, without some big crazy explanation.  I will copy and paste it all here. Please read it all. This is not to change your mind on anything, but just to INFORM. There are sources for everything also. </p>

<p>Starting (yet again this is someone elses ELI5, that I thought was wrote perfectly out, and wanted to share): </p>

<p>1st. I just want to say right here and now that after reading into this for over a month, I have done a bit of soul searching. </p>

<p>2nd. The amount of information required to firmly grasp what I am going to be posting here is significant. Hundreds of pages of legislation, lawsuits, lobbying firms, court rulings, official statements; which some of these can go back to laws established in the 30s, has gone into this, and I am certain there is still more out there to read which will come as time goes on. But I wanted to post this no before people freak out even more when Trump signs this all into law.</p>

<p>So if you are wanting any kind of tl:dr, then the only thing I can say is this;</p>

<p>No ISP is going to have the legal means to target you personally on your internet history, unless you are the only customer of their service. Companies abuse legal definitions to squirm their way out of ****. The Net Neutrality laws currently in place need to be amended for good reason.</p>

<p>There&#39;s your tl;dr. if you actually care to gain some context to it all, then continue. Else I would say it&#39;s not worth your time and you can carry on with your day. Your ability to browse porn and collect rare Pepes will be unhindered either way.</p>

<p>3rd. I am going to first touch the issue of the Privacy law that everyone has panicked about due to such a grand amount of fear mongering and misinformation, then I will discuss the &quot;Open Internet Order&quot; adopted in 2015, which is our current interpretation of Net Neutrality laws at the moment.</p>

<p>4th. This is going to be a long post. The amount of reading is vast, and I will do my best to navigate information when providing my sources.</p>

<hr/>

<p>So everyone has been understandably upset about their internet privacy. It’s easy to come to the conclusion that we are losing our privacy when so many news groups are reacting to this. Unfortunately, info graphics don’t give this subject the justice it deserves, and we’re waist deep in misinformation.</p>

<p>Everyone has been hearing how &quot;The Republican sold you out. Now ISPs will be able to sell your personal data to the highest bidder.&quot;</p>

<p>Pretty scary sounding right? Sounds like your whole world is going to change?</p>

<p>So scary that people decided to throw some numbers on info graphics and even scare you a little bit more.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, info-graphics like this are wide-spread and thrive off fear mongering. It’s quite a damning accusation, and ultimately graphics like this are often lacking any sort of source to back them up.</p>

<p>I took the liberty to do some researching, and decided to pick out one of the most &quot;Evil&quot; Internet Service Providers I could find and see how politically diverse they are</p>

<p><a href="http://memestatic.fjcdn.com/pictures/Let_4d6a15_6224921.jpg">Comcast Picture Statistic Link</a> <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/orgs/recips.php?id=D000000461&amp;type=P&amp;state=&amp;sort=A&amp;cycle=2016">source</a></p>

<p>I know we want to cause as much fear an hatred as possible and say the Republicans are the sellouts, but political contributions have been going everywhere. I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s good. I am just saying that unless you have more information, don&#39;t be taking info graphics you see online to heart. There are many factors and far better ways to acquire information.</p>

<p>I&#39;m going to continue by easing some of your fears regarding the internet right now. Cause these info graphics and Facebook posts you see online over the years about Net Neutrality and Online Privacy abuse, have really been a huge source of not so much misinformation, but misdirection. Because all they have been doing has been causing you great fear and distress. Which is something many people are hoping for when they want things to go their way.</p>

<p>As we move forward I want you guys to keep something in your mind; Definitions mean almost everything in a court room, Jurisdiction of an organization matters, and legislation can play favorites.</p>

<p>So, about that internet privacy bill that so many people are so scared over and think that they can now go buy their representatives online history. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not happening. I will quote an article from Forbes that sums it up a little easier then I will touch some existing legislation that protects you.</p>

<p>If this truly causes you fear, that the idea of seeing an increase of ads for a hot searched item appear in your area, then this post will serve no purpose for you. But they still are unable to target you personally, and take any information from you. You will remain masked.</p>

<p>his is due mostly to already existing telecommunication and data collection laws that prevent the ability to target people specifically for marketing purposes, and can not disclose personal information. As mentioned in the Forbes article, it would be illegal if someone were to &quot;sell you out&quot;</p>

<p>47 U.S. Code § 222 - Privacy of customer information (This law is known as the &quot;Section 222&quot; law)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>(c) Confidentiality of customer proprietary network information
(1) Privacy requirements for telecommunications carriers</p>

<p>Except as required by law or with the approval of the customer, a telecommunications carrier that receives or obtains customer proprietary network information by virtue of its provision of a telecommunications service shall only use, disclose, or permit access to individually identifiable customer proprietary network information in its provision of (A) the telecommunications service from which such information is derived, or (B) services necessary to, or used in, the provision of such telecommunications service, including the publishing of directories.</p>

<p>(2) Disclosure on request by customers</p>

<p>A telecommunications carrier shall disclose customer proprietary network information, upon affirmative written request by the customer, to any person designated by the customer.</p>

<p>(3) Aggregate customer information</p>

<p>A telecommunications carrier that receives or obtains customer proprietary network information by virtue of its provision of a telecommunications service may use, disclose, or permit access to aggregate customer information other than for the purposes described in paragraph (1). A local exchange carrier may use, disclose, or permit access to aggregate customer information other than for purposes described in paragraph (1) only if it provides such aggregate information to other carriers or persons on reasonable and nondiscriminatory terms and conditions upon reasonable request therefor.</p>

<p>In short, your personal history is not going to be sold and unmask you to the highest bidder. You are used as a statistic, not a target. Not saying that&#39;s a good thing, and you can still have issues with that, but I wanted to clarify this for the following issue.</p>

<p>People have been mislead into a sense of indignation; that they have raised nearly $300,000 in hopes of enacting a little Karma against Congress, thinking they will be able to purchase their online history..</p>

<p>(Can&#39;t post the GoFundMe Pages) News Source: <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-39443161">1</a> <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2017/3/29/15115382/buy-congress-web-history-gop-fake-internet-privacy">2</a></p>

<p>People are under the wrong impression of how this works, and are giving up their money to a lost cause.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But here&#39;s the real problem: you can&#39;t buy Congress&#39; internet data. You can&#39;t buy my internet data. You can&#39;t buy your internet data. That&#39;s not how this works. It&#39;s a common misconception. We even saw this in Congress four years ago, where Rep. Louis Gohmert went on a smug but totally ignorant rant, asking why Google won&#39;t sell the government all the data it has on people. As we explained at the time, that&#39;s not how it works*. Advertisers aren&#39;t buying your browsing data, and ISPs and other internet companies aren&#39;t selling your data in a neat little package. It doesn&#39;t help anyone to blatantly misrepresent what&#39;s going on.</p>

<p>When ISPs or online services have your data and &quot;sell&quot; it, it doesn&#39;t mean that you can go to, say, AT&amp;T and offer to buy &quot;all of Louis Gohmert&#39;s browsing history.&quot; Instead, what happens is that these companies collect that data for themselves and then sell targeting. That is, when Gohmert goes to visit his favorite publication, that website will cast out to various marketplaces for bids on what ads to show. Thanks to information tracking, it may throw up some demographic and interest data to the marketplace. So, it may say that it has a page being viewed by a male from Texas, who was recently visiting webpages about boardgames and cow farming (to randomly choose some items). Then, from that marketplace, some advertisers&#39; computerized algorithms will more or less say &quot;well, I&#39;m selling boardgames about cows in Texas, and therefore, this person&#39;s attention is worth 1/10th of a penny more to me than some other company that&#39;s selling boardgames about moose.&quot; And then the webpage will display the ad about cow boardgames. </p>

<p>All this happens in a split second, before the page has fully loaded.</p>

<p>At no point does the ad exchange or any of the advertisers know that this is &quot;Louis Gohmert, Congressional Rep.&quot; Nor do they get any other info. They just know that if they are willing to spend the required amount to get the ad shown via the marketplace bidding mechanism, it will show up in front of someone who is somewhat more likely to be interested in the content. That&#39;s it. </p>

<p>So those who have bought into the fear mongering and decided to give up some of your funds, I would begin to hope they don&#39;t go &quot;No Refunds&quot; in the end, and follow through with using the money for a noble cause.</p>

<hr/>

<p>So now this begs the question, if we were already well protected, what exactly was being repealed?</p>

<p>For this I will slightly defer to a recent Verge article, then elaborate.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a trickier question than you might think! Let’s take a step back: telecom regulation isn’t like criminal law, where the word of the law draws a clear line between what’s legal and illegal. Most of what the FCC does is interpreting the same law — the Telecom Act of 1934 — to apply to modern technologies like wireless internet and broadband.</p>

<p>The Telecom Act says a lot about what companies can do with customer data in general — but because it was written with copper telephone networks in mind, it’s genuinely unclear how to apply those principles to data like browsing history and IP logs. That’s where the FCC comes in, interpreting the Telecom Act to say which kinds of data fall under which provisions of the law.</p>

<p>The privacy rules set by previous FCC chairman Tom Wheeler — the ones that just got repealed — were our first indication of how that customer data could be treated now that broadband and wireless service were classified under Title II, the big net neutrality decision made back in 2015. In many ways, the rules are less like a law than a promise of enforcement. Basically, this is what the FCC thinks the Telecom Act means, and if they think you’re violating the Telecom Act, they’ll sue you for millions of dollars. As a result, it’s very much in companies’ interest to follow the rules.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2017/3/31/15138526/isp-privacy-bill-vote-trump-marsha-blackburn-internet-browsing-history">Source</a></p>

<p>The order being pushed forward, was a clarification of definitions and Title II reclassification of the original 2015 Net Neutrality Order, also known as the Open Internet Order. As the Open Internet order had reclassified Broadband Internet as a Utility, mobile internet providers as Common carriers, and abstained classification (from what I know at the moment) of other companies.</p>

<p>Here is the Open Internet Order for those who wish to view. It is 400 pages long. Aslo the repealed Order in question.</p>

<p>Sources: <a href="https://apps.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/FCC-15-24A1_Rcd.pdf">1</a> <a href="https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-12-02/pdf/2016-28006.pdf#page=1">2</a> </p>

<p>The next question we want to ask, is why? If this document was more so a clarification of definitions, what is the point of repealing it?</p>

<p>The answer is what it was clarifying. The Open Internet Order.</p>

<p>The open internet order faced criticism by 2/5 of the FCC commissioners (including current FCC Chairman Pai) due to that reclassification of different internet providers with increasing regulations, would be an overreach of the FCC. It harmed small businesses from competing and giving different companies different sets of rules, essentially playing favorites. Having harder regulations, would kill off smaller ISP providers and make it far more difficult to compete against companies such as google fiber which are already well set and funded.</p>

<p>Prior to the FCC Open internet order, jurisdiction over privacy and information abuse was held by the Federal Trade Commission since the beginning of the internet. The FTC was highly regarded as the proper authority, and would follow more uniform measure to protect the people from multiple forms of online abuse from multiple forms of Internet Providers. </p>

<p>Reclassification of Title II changed what was under the jurisdiction of the FTC, and in some instances created a policy vacuum.</p>

<p>As stated by FTC commissioner Maureen K. Ohlhausen 2016;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When the FCC adopted its net neutrality rules, it chose to reclassify “Broadband Internet Access Service”, or “BIAS” as a Title II common carrier service.This affected the FTC’s oversight of BIAS providers. Although the FTC has general jurisdiction, there are a few carve outs, including common carriers acting as common carriers. Thus, the FCC’s reclassification affected the FTC’s long-standing authority to protect consumers’ privacy in their interactions with their broadband internet service providers.</p>

<p>This change to the oversight of ISP privacy practices matters because the FTC is the primary privacy and data protection agency in the U.S., and probably the most active enforcer of privacy laws in the world. We have brought more than 150 privacy and data security related enforcement actions, including actions against ISPs and against some of the biggest companies in the Internet ecosystem. We also conduct extensive consumer and business outreach and guidance, coordinate workshops to foster discussions about privacy in emerging areas, coordinate on privacy efforts internationally, and advocate for policies about privacy and data use that improve consumer welfare.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.insidesources.com/ftc-loss-in-att-case-could-leave-companies-in-a-privacy-enforcement-vacuum/">Source</a></p>

<p>Due to the Title II reclassifications of IPSs under the Open Internet Order, it limited what the FTC could regulate and protect the consumer. The very law established for Net Neutrality, which was to help protect against throttling your network, allowed for specific companies to abuse just that.</p>

<p>Right now, the MSM has been about demonstrating &quot;Pai&#39;s hatred for Net Neutrality&quot;, but the public are not aware of the impact by the reclassification of Title II. Pai has been pushing to decrease regulation and return jurisdiction back to the FTC, where the internet and many businesses affected were more uniformly regulated, and where the laws didn&#39;t resemble that of playing favorites.</p>

<p>This was released by chairman Pai, a couple days ago: <a href="http://memestatic.fjcdn.com/pictures/Let_0220e5_6224921.jpg">Letter</a> </p>

<p><a href="http://transition.fcc.gov/Daily_Releases/Daily_Business/2017/db0328/DOC-344116A1.pdf">Source</a></p>

<p>Pai and Trump wish to return jurisdiction back to the FTC. There is still plenty of information to learn, but this is already the largest post I have ever made. I just wanted to understand what was happening, and I wanted to ease as many fears as possible. At least give people an idea of why everything is happening. I am not claiming to have all the information here, but as big as this is already, it is a small summary of the truth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. The dangerous mindset is seeing a post get 20k+ upvotes in a subreddit where even the biggest natural stories barely break 8-10k, and NOT realizing there is some kind of vote manipulation going on.</p>

<p>I am not saying Share Blue is involved for sure, only that it fits their MO, or the MO of whoever it is that is manipulating <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> and <a href="/r/esist">/r/esist</a>. The number of seemingly extra votes on that posted correlated with the number of extra votes posts get on <a href="/r/esist">/r/esist</a> when they are being used as chips in whatever the political battle of the moment is.</p>

<p>It&#39;s well known that this sub has been in Trump&#39;s court as of late due to the massive number of conspiring against him.</p>

<p>That thread was a blatant attempt to change that perception. It basically said &quot;If Trump signs this, we all have to no longer support him at all&quot;. It wasn&#39;t at all a debate on the merits of the bill, it was a black and white ultimatum based on misinformation and fear mongering.</p>

<p>You basically implied I was falling for cult thought, and then get upset when I tell you to grow up? </p>

<p>If you weren&#39;t going around implying that because someone has information they must be biased because of who they voted for or where they post on Reddit, I wouldn&#39;t have to tell you to grow up. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not being defensive either, I&#39;m just stating facts. I posted this to inform people. However, for some reason, even with the post being right here, you call me biased.. so I&#39;d have to guess you didn&#39;t read it all. </p>

<p>If a Hillary Clinton supporter made a post with information from unbiased independent sources, the laws, court hearings, etc, listed the pros and cons, I wouldn&#39;t say &quot;A bit of biased there huh? Falling for that cult?&quot; </p>

<p>People vote differently. People have different opinions. People talk about their opinions all the time. That doesn&#39;t mean they can&#39;t be unbiased and think rationally. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The TL;DR version of your synopsis is this:</p>

<p>&quot;Advertisers won&#39;t bother picking you out from the crowd because they buy users in bulk solely for the purpose of issuing advertisements. Title II sucks because it&#39;s anti-competitive to the small ISPs who are going to get pushed out of business, and because privacy rights went out from under the domain of the FTC and into a power vacuum currently being exploited by telecom companies.&quot;</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure why you feel the need to place so many hedges that include stuff like, &quot;it&#39;s really complicated,&quot; and, &quot;you&#39;re being misled.&quot; </p>

<p>Why I still disagree with you is this: ISPs are now in a position to collect your data. Ostensibly this is for the purpose of sale, but what if it&#39;s not? What if the buyer is, say, our own government (or a subsidiary) whose purpose has nothing to do with advertising? The loophole certainly exists for this. </p>

<p>Moreover, what about the collection techniques now being afforded to ISPs? We already know PRISM was about the govt working through private companies for the purpose of data collection on individual citizens... now it becomes easy for the govt to say, &quot;give me the data you collect on ISP whatever.&quot; And now, they&#39;ll have it. Who is to stop the ISP from expanding its data collection to include things like conversations recorded while browsing &quot;to enhance the contextual information sold to advertisers&quot; (or some other such BS)?</p>

<p>You saying that it&#39;s UNLIKELY that ISPs will target you personally is far from reassuring, because nothing about the law prevents them from doing this. And therefore, nothing prevents third parties from exploiting this for nefarious purposes as they&#39;ve already been known to do. </p>

<p>As for Title II. Sure, maybe there&#39;s the negative ramification of the FTC no longer governing privacy rights, but that doesn&#39;t negate the fact it was awesome in preventing telecoms from offering the internet in tiered packages (and conveniently removing &quot;fake news&quot; ie, independent media from being downloadable due to throttling). I&#39;d rather enshrine net neutrality laws now and fill the void in privacy oversight than gut Title II altogether. </p>

<p>So... for as long as your spiel was, I am not reassured. </p>

<p>Exactly this is the crux of the issue for me. If the law does not explicitly say they cannot do it, someone will. Laws like these are supposed to protect people from abuse and here there seems to be little to no protection.</p>

<p>We even saw this in Congress four years ago, where Rep. Louis Gohmert went on a smug but totally ignorant rant, asking why Google won&#39;t sell the government all the data it has on people.

It doesn&#39;t help anyone to blatantly misrepresent what&#39;s going on. </p>

<p>The information collected is not available to be used in the way</p>

<p>They would just be buying statistics, such as this town eats a lot of chicken. Let&#39;s give them ads of chicken. Sure I can see how governments can use that to their advantage. I agree I personally don&#39;t like the it, but it&#39;s not how you put it. Nor is there a loophole for them to buy your personal information. </p>

<p>Which is why I made this post to make that distinction, to just inform people so they can make their own opinions. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Who is to stop the ISP from expanding its data collection to include things like conversations recorded while browsing &quot;to enhance the contextual information sold to advertisers&quot; (or some other such BS)?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;d ask you to read over the whole thing and read the sources. This again is not what they can do. It&#39;s not like they will get all of your information and just hand everything over to whoever the highest bidder is. Nor can they sell recording of your voice. </p>

<p>There is laws against this which I posted with sources: <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/47/222">https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/47/222</a></p>

<p>However, I still understand perfectly why people might not like this. I just wanted to post to inform people on the issue, especially since there is a lot of misinformation going around. Not only that but it is very hard to understand. I barely understand all of it, and I&#39;ve been reading on it for days and days. I had to find sources, laws, court hearings, etc. I found posts of people explaining, then having to look up sources for that etc. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not telling people what to believe. I&#39;m just saying, here is the information, make up your own mind. Which is a lot better than half the shit that just says &quot;SELLING YOUR PRIVACY&quot;. Which then leaves people to make Go Fund Me Pages, trying to buy congresses information. </p>

PR agencies spun the story to make it about reclassifying internet providers as common carriers.

The FTC had an iron clad rule against PII being released and the FCC tried to break down the barrier and have some PII be available to sell. It&#39;s in the second link.

<p>They each have a different approach to keeping private data private. My understanding is the FCC would have allowed some PII to be marketed and the FTC won&#39;t. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>ISPs to now sell our data along with Google and Facebook.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It comes down to specifically what PII data was to be sold by the FCC and FTC. Until 2015 nobody complained about the job the FTC was doing and it appears their plan is aligned more toward accepted international standards.</p>
