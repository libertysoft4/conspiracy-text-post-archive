<p>While it is true that Jews are disproportionately successful, this does not mean that Jews are behind a conspiracy to subjugate non-Jews or to undermine our society.  </p>

<p>This is not to say that Israel, for example, is somehow innocent.  But we have to separate Jews, as a people, from actions taken by Israel or other lobbies. </p>

<p>I just find it very disturbing that so many people are being taken in by anti-Jewish conspiracy theories. </p>

<p>Another problem is that the Venn diagram of anti-Zionists and anti-semitists has a pretty huge overlap. IMO the reason is that I&#39;ve observed many many anti-Zionists tolerate anti-semitism in their forums possibly because they&#39;re just happy to see the chorus grow louder.</p>

<p>that&#39;s because that line of thinking only get&#39;s peddled when someone with influence comes out against Israel and its&#39; actions in Palestine. Which is why you hardly ever see anyone of influence take a stance against Israel. </p>

<p>Jewish mysticism and Freemasonry have some interesting overlaps about a hidden female divinity. If Isreal is the female state of God, is she a location, or the people entire? Does the recreation of Isreal = end of days? What is controllable by man or by the Divine?</p>

<p>“If this hostility, even aversion, had only been shown towards the Jews at one period and in one country, it would be easy to unravel the limited causes of this anger, but this race has been on the contrary an object of hatred to all the peoples among whom it has established itself. It must be therefore, since the enemies of the Jews belonged to the most diverse races, since they lived in countries very distant from each other, since they were ruled by very different laws, governed by opposite principles, since they had neither the same morals, nor the same customs, since they were animated by unlike dispositions which did not permit them to judge of anything in the some way, it must be therefore that the general cause of anti-Semitism has always resided in Israel itself and not in those who have fought against Israel.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>wrong, Zionist do advocate for a Jewish state, but also actively looking to trigger the end of the world with biblical prophecy. The believe their is a specific way to trigger armageddon. So its pretty selfish, maybe the ultimate selfish thing to kill over nearly 7 people to bring your own heaven. You missed the biggest part of zionism, because there are even Christian Zionists who believe they live a spiritual/religious life and woud like to go to heaven now.

<p>Just a single individual troll can be responsible for half of the anti semitic posts in this sub. It is a proven fact that a couple have been caught red handed. Now think about the ones who haven&#39;t been caught yet. I believe this explains the vast majority of the racist crap in this sub. </p>

<p>The rest of the anti semitic stuff should get removed, but that is just my personal opinion and that&#39;s up to the mods. There are clearly going to be some real racists who come here, but the vast majority of it is manufactured nonsense. </p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t help perceptions at all though that Israel is a religious/apartheid state, and that they are re-settling any members of the religion, even from distant countries in settlements to ethnically or religiously cleanse the region, but it&#39;s no excuse for blaming ALL members of the religion world wide.  </p>

<p>The fundamentalists of the three major monotheistic religions are actually very similar to each other, and a big problem. </p>

Christians are saved, after all (the Reformed even refer to themselves as &quot;God&#39;s elect&quot;).  Muslims aren&#39;t much different from Jews when it comes to their basic beliefs.  Etc.  </p>

<p>Jews are just more unique (and smaller in number) because they don&#39;t seek converts in the modern era. </p>
