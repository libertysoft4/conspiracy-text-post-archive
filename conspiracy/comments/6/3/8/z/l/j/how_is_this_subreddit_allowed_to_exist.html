There really is no punitive recourse that could occur. There are only 440,000 subscribers, only a fraction of which who would organize into any sort of opposition were this subreddit to be shut down. And it&#39;s hard to think that reddit is beyond the reach of the elites, given the amount of shilling that goes on across this wesbite. I don&#39;t see why those in control would allow such a forum to exist, a place which promotes active antagonism toward the oppressive control schemes. If this subreddit were to actually one day simply not exist anymore, what could be done?</p>

<p>But this page does expose corruption, it also exposes deceit and wrong-doing on many levels. </p>

<p>It hasn&#39;t been removed or closed down because ultimately it is still a small page, we are a page that has minimum impact on reddit or the internet. TPTB have no need to remove pages like r/conspiracy because the vast majority of people are still satisfied with MSM. </p>

<p>More to the point you could use the same argument as yours and ask the same questions about Alex Jones or GLP. Those examples alone raise there own questions. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s probably the fact that it would still be too much of a red pill moment for a lot of people. However, if they can formulate a good excuse to do so at some point, i imagine they could go that route. Until then, trying to control the narrative is their plan.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I certainly don&#39;t want to get into an argument over this, but if someone found out for the first time this year that there is a Deep State in the US that is in permanent control of government policy and controls the entire mainstream media, that&#39;s deeply impactful.   Learning that what you believed your entire life was a democracy is actually more like fascism (and that&#39;s before Trump came along!) was likely the most mid-shattering event I&#39;ve ever had (except for having babies).</p>

<p>It&#39;s not meaningless when you&#39;re learning- and millions of people are waking up all over the country.</p>

<p>Just some food for thought, unless I misunderstood you. I get that your overall point is most people just want to argue, and that&#39;s true, but the underlying facts are deeply troubling. </p>
