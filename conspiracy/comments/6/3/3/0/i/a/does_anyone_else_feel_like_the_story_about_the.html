        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I am getting a weird feeling about the story from Oklahoma last week where the 23 year old shot and killed those three teenage robbers in his house with an AR-15.  Especially the way the mainstream media is covering it.  Check out these videos from ABC news about it:</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/2QesUgAjVsE">https://youtu.be/2QesUgAjVsE</a></p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/scvatpWbbXo">https://youtu.be/scvatpWbbXo</a></p>

<p>It seems like they are trying to say that it wasn&#39;t justified for him to shoot them.  Then they bring out Nancy Grace who defends it as self defense but she sounds a little strange so it&#39;s like they&#39;re trying to make people think only crazy people would say that it&#39;s justified.  She keeps talking about how it&#39;s a &quot;semi-automatic&quot; weapon as if that is something out of the ordinary, and then she says it&#39;s &quot;just like an M16 military rifle, it&#39;s semi-automatic&quot; which doesn&#39;t make sense because an M16 can fire fully automatic or three round burst (3 rounds per trigger pull) but a regular civilian AR-15 can only fire one round per trigger pull.  And they&#39;re acting like using an AR-15 is excessive force since they robbers didn&#39;t have guns, but how is he supposed to know that when they kick in his door and come inside?</p>

<p>For some reason I feel like this guy is going to be charged with murder and they will to try to use it as a reason to repeal &quot;stand your ground&quot; laws and try to ban semi-auto rifles or something.  Not that I think it will work, but it just seems like that&#39;s what they&#39;re trying to do.  Another thing is, I thought &quot;stand your ground&quot; laws referred to not having to flee from a threat if you are anywhere out in public that you are lawfully allowed to be, but laws for defending yourself inside your home or vehicle were called &quot;castle doctrine&quot; laws.  I don&#39;t know, I guess we&#39;ll see what happens but what do you guys think?</p>

When I seen that headline on CNN website I was highly suspicious. I read the article and it really didn&#39;t go with any agenda the are pushing right now so I didn&#39;t think much about it. But it is VERY odd a local story like that was on CNN. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I find it harder to imagine that 3 home invaders in Oklahoma wouldn&#39;t be armed with guns, as I&#39;m sure this guy did, which is probably why he shot at all 3.

<p>You see how projection works, in the first video they said the teens were armed, but didn&#39;t say what they had, so 90% of the viewers would assume they had guns.
Now it wasn&#39;t until the second video that we found out it was brass knuckles, a knife and a mask, O&#39; MSM and their dirty little tricks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I live close to where this happened, at let me tell you, if he took this to trial, no jury in Oklahoma would convict him.</p>

<p>IANAL but I&#39;m pretty sure this is textbook <a href="http://www.oscn.net/applications/oscn/DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=69782">castle doctrine</a>, and Oklahoma is very pro-gun and pro-stand your ground. We literally just had the largest gun show in the country in the area this happened. He&#39;s not gonna get convicted.</p>

<p>But I will tell you, local news has been absolutely <em>destroying</em> this kid, saying he used &quot;excessive force&quot; in defending his home and that since they weren&#39;t armed with a firearm that he should&#39;ve fired warning shots.</p>

<p>They obviously haven&#39;t read the law. Oklahoma very much favors the defender in this scenario</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A. The Legislature hereby recognizes that the citizens of the State of Oklahoma have a right to expect absolute safety within their own homes or places of business.</p>

<p>B. A person or an owner, manager or employee of a business is presumed to have held a reasonable fear of imminent peril of death or great bodily harm to himself or herself or another when using defensive force that is intended or likely to cause death or great bodily harm to another if:</p>
</blockquote>

<ol>
<li><p>The person against whom the defensive force was used was in the process of unlawfully and forcefully entering, or had unlawfully and forcibly entered, a dwelling, residence, occupied vehicle, or a place of business, or if that person had removed or was attempting to remove another against the will of that person from the dwelling, residence, occupied vehicle, or place of business; and</p></li>
<li><p>The person who uses defensive force knew or had reason to believe that an unlawful and forcible entry or unlawful and forcible act was occurring or had occurred.</p></li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
<p>C. The presumption set forth in subsection B of this section does not apply if:</p>
</blockquote>

<ol>
<li><p>The person against whom the defensive force is used has the right to be in or is a lawful resident of the dwelling, residence, or vehicle, such as an owner, lessee, or titleholder, and there is not a protective order from domestic violence in effect or a written pretrial supervision order of no contact against that person;</p></li>
<li><p>The person or persons sought to be removed are children or grandchildren, or are otherwise in the lawful custody or under the lawful guardianship of, the person against whom the defensive force is used; or</p></li>
<li><p>The person who uses defensive force is engaged in an unlawful activity or is using the dwelling, residence, occupied vehicle, or place of business to further an unlawful activity.</p></li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
<p>D. A person who is not engaged in an unlawful activity and who is attacked in any other place where he or she has a right to be has <strong><em>no duty to retreat</em></strong> and has the right to stand his or her ground and meet force with force, <strong><em>including deadly force</em></strong>, if he or she reasonably believes it is necessary to do so to prevent death or great bodily harm to himself or herself or another <strong><em>or to prevent the commission of a forcible felony.</em></strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Call the police, if they are standing in your doorway but doing nothing aggressive, there is nothing else you can do legally, if they act aggressively (yelling and stuff doesn&#39;t matter), so like coming at you, etc etc, then you could defend yourself, but if you kill them, even if they are trying to stab you with a knife and they don&#39;t and you shoot them, even if that gun is registered, your likely being put into jail. </p>

<p>Canada is a shithole. My tax return was just taken by Student Loans, Student Loans tells me they don&#39;t have my debt, its with a third party debt collector (why?), I am on government assistance, Canada Revenue tells me there is no way to recover a portion of income tax, friend just did and get like 40% of return back. I have my government worker tell me to go speak to the MP&#39;s Regional office and have them take a further look into it because the situation makes no sense. I am being used atm, depressed, I have been looking for work for months but after a bunch of interviews, no call backs, oddly. I am unable to get repayment assistance on my student loans, although a person I know who owns and runs a business is eligible, but a person who makes nothing and is on government assistance, is uneligible for repayment assistance, and is having his tax return taken away, although student loans doesn&#39;t have my loan, so this third party law firm was able to use some type of connections to get their hands on my tax return. A poor persons tax return. </p>

<p>IDK if anywhere else is like this, but this world is turning into a shithole. </p>
