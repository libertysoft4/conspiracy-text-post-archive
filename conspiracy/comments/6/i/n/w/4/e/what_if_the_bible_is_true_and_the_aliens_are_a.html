        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Ok, The bible talks alot about there being a deception coming to deceive the whole world and from what I can see, this whole alien agenda seems very fishy to me.</p>

<p>What makes the alien agenda fishy is:</p>

<p><strong>1.)</strong>  So called alien spirits being channeled through people, which could be demonic spirits deceiving people as it is said in the bible.</p>

<p><strong>2.)</strong>  Mostly all alien/ufo&#39;s are associated with new age spirituality, in which people try to contact aliens through Pleiadien/spirit channeling, meditation, sacred geometry as if this is some type of cult.  The bible considers these things as sorcery and witchcraft.</p>

<p><strong>3.)</strong>  The use of New Age trigger words used by most speakers such as <em>(David Icke)</em> and alien/Pleiadien spirit channelers <em>(Nora Herold)</em>, such as <em>Consciousness</em>, <em>Frequency, *Vibration</em>, <em>Self</em>, <em>Enlightenment</em> and <em>Dimension</em>, as if they are programming people with these  trigger words to add more credibility to the lie.</p>

<p><strong>4.)</strong>  All the channeled aliens claim to be beings of light, while the bible says that satan can transform himself into an angel of light.  2 Corinthians 11:14 - And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light.</p>

<p><strong>5.)</strong>  All these so called aliens all claim that they want to help us, which makes me believe there&#39;s a hidden agenda.</p>

<p><strong>6.)</strong>  Alien and UFO organizations covering up testimonies of people stopping alien abductions by using Jesus name.  <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmNM_E3wt8c">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmNM_E3wt8c</a></strong> . Which makes me believe that these aliens are demonic spiritual beings.  Ephesians 6:12 - For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.</p>

<p><strong>7.)</strong>  The laser focused attack on Jesus Christ and The Bible, which makes me believe that satan is behind these attacks, because Galatians 1:8 - &quot;But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach a gospel other than the one we preached to you, let them be under God&#39;s curse!&quot;  Here&#39;s a video from alien channeler trying discredit Christianity.  <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ojc39vDD_Sk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ojc39vDD_Sk</a></strong></p>

<p><strong>The Bible constantly warns us about deception:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Revelation 12:9</strong>-And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.</p>

<p><strong>Matthew 24:4</strong> - Jesus answered: &quot;Watch out that no one deceives you.</p>

<p><strong>2 Peter 2:1</strong> - But there were false prophets also among the people, even as there shall be false teachers among you, who privily shall bring in damnable heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring upon themselves swift destruction.</p>

<p><strong>Ephesians 5:6</strong> - Let no one deceive you with empty words, for because of such things God’s wrath comes on the sons of disobedience.</p>

<p><strong>Matthew 7:15</strong> - &quot;Watch out for false prophets. They come to you in sheep&#39;s clothing, but inwardly they are ferocious wolves.</p>

<p><strong>1 John 4:3</strong> - but every spirit that does not acknowledge Jesus is not from God. This is the spirit of the antichrist, which you have heard is coming and even now is already in the world.</p>

<p><strong>Mark 13:5-6</strong> </p>

<ol>
<li>Jesus began by telling them, “See to it that no one deceives you. </li>
<li>Many will come in My name, claiming, ‘I am He,’ and will deceive many</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Ephesians 6:11</strong> - Put on the full armor of God, so that you can take your stand against the devil&#39;s schemes.</p>

<p><strong>2 Thessalonians 2:10-12</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>and with every wicked deception directed against those who are perishing, because they refused the love of the truth that would have saved them. </li>
<li>For this reason, God will send them a powerful delusion so that they will believe the lie, </li>
<li>in order that judgment will come upon all who have disbelieved the truth and delighted in wickedness</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Mark 13:22-23</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>For false Christs and false prophets will appear and perform signs and wonders that would deceive even the elect, if that were possible. </li>
<li>So be on your guard; I have told you everything in advance</li>
</ol>

<p>In conclusion there are going to be many deceptions that we&#39;re going to face and the bible constantly warns us, which leads me to believe that aliens are a deception sent by satan to deceive the masses.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What&#39;s so funny, if I said aliens were real, then everybody would thumb up my post, because that&#39;s the lie that they want to hear.  People&#39;s ears are itching to hears lies.</p>

<p>*<em>2 Timothy 4:3 - *</em>For the time will come when people will not put up with sound doctrine. Instead, to suit their own desires, they will gather around them a great number of teachers to say what their itching ears want to hear.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>It&#39;s so true</strong> in fact that our literal sun, moon, stars and wandering stars (planets) are fulfilling their pre-ordained prophetic alignment revealed from Jesus Himself ~2000 years ago to us in <strong>Revelation 12:1-2</strong> on EXACTLY September 23, 2017, this very year. The sign has already been forming every night above all of our heads for the last 6 months to a blind and unaware world.</p>

<p>Their paths and rotations were woven into them at their very creation specifically for this sign (and many others!) The Day of the Lord is almost here.</p>

<p><strong>Truth</strong> is far stranger than fiction my friend.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I judge everything according to the bible and I put my faith in Jesus Christ.  </p>

<p>The bible says &quot;Let God be true and every man a liar&quot;, this is why I don&#39;t put my trust in men like Greer, because Greer goes off telling people to go contact aliens, while there are people saying that they&#39;ve stopped alien abductions in Jesus name, so that tells me that aliens are spiritual beings and Greer is promoting the contact of spiritual beings that flee from Jesus Christ, which means the alien beings are demons and Greer is putting people in spiritual danger.</p>

<p>In conclusion, don&#39;t trust people promoting the alien agenda.  Trust only Jesus Christ</p>

    <div class="md"><p>thats fair, and Jesus name does seem to weild to serious power and im basing that on other ppls testimonies and personal situations ive been in. i belive there a good reson there still exists a specialty class of exorcisim priests today.</p>

<p>i dont think jesus had to die on the cross for anybodys sins thous and no person son of God or not should be subjected to such cruelty. and the worshiping of the cross prevalent almost seems perverse to me and backwards. </p>

<p>but i think a lot can be learned from jesus teachings and the power of confronting ppl with honesty, compasion and the truth ... whatever that maybe.</p>

<p>Do some research outside of the Bible before throwing around your accusations. I literally don&#39;t have time for people that only look at 1 source for their information. Like I said before the Bible has some truth in it but it was manipulated over the ages to cause people to worship the sun and Yahweh. This research has taken me many years to complete and you don&#39;t deserve the time it would take to write out all of the books on my bookshelf because you&#39;re just going to quote from the Bible again and call me a liar.</p>

<p>2 Corinthians 4:4 - <strong>Satan, who is the god of this world</strong>, has blinded the minds of those who don&#39;t believe. They are unable to see the glorious light of the Good News. They don&#39;t understand this message about the glory of Christ, who is the exact likeness of God.</p>

<p>If you worship the OT god then you&#39;re worshiping Satan. Go research gnosticism, hermeticism, Saturn, understand the Talmud and Kabbalah, occult practices, secret societies, and then get back to me. Otherwise you haven&#39;t put in even 1% of my effort.</p>

<p>Bullshit. You&#39;re just buying into the mainstream Christian deception created by the Roman Catholic church. Again, the OT god called for animal and human sacrifice in multiple passages. Your OT god also stood only behind one particular nation: Israel. You worship a horrible racist god that slaughters innocent people. Did Jesus Christ do ANY of these things? You&#39;re very confused.</p>

<p>No you didn&#39;t, and you&#39;re being incredibly ignorant now. If you&#39;ve researched any of that then you can tell me why the Freemasons use a black and white checkerboard pattern everywhere, and the meaning behind the art murals of the Bank of America HQ in North Carolina. </p>

<p>What do the Freemasons worship?
What is the meaning of the Ouroboros for them?
What is the significance of the black cube?
Why does Yahweh require human and animal sacrifice?
Why do you believe sin is moral wrongdoing if people are born into it? What&#39;s the point of it if we can&#39;t decide whether to be good or bad, if we&#39;re already bad to begin with?
What is the Tree of Life in the Kabbalah?
What is the purpose of the Talmud?</p>

<p>If you worship the OT god then you&#39;re worshiping Satan. Go research gnosticism, hermeticism, Saturn, understand the Talmud and Kabbalah, occult practices, secret societies, and then get back to me. Otherwise you haven&#39;t put in even 1% of my effort.</p>

<p>Every single item of research you listed there is demonic occult deception and full of lies. Every. Single. One. Researching those topics should help convince you that the Bible is indeed authored by God Himself, and these are the VERY things He warned the Israelites (and all people) to stay away from (which they didn&#39;t). We are paying the price for that disobedience even to this very day.</p>

<p>Matthew 25:11-13 is perfect for you, and at present is exactly what you are going to hear based on the current path you are on if you continue to deny Jesus as God <strong>(HE IS YHWH/JEHOVAH!!!)</strong> and deny his atoning sacrifice for YOUR personal sin. </p>

<p>“Later the others also came. ‘Lord, Lord,’ they said, ‘open the door for us!’ “But he replied, ‘<strong>Truly I tell you, I don’t know you</strong>.’ “Therefore keep watch, because you do not know the day or the hour.&quot; - <strong>Matthew 25:11-13</strong></p>

<p>You know NOTHING about Jesus, or His Father, or the reason for blood sacrifices, or the reason for cleansing polluted bloodlines of Nephilim hybrids, or the real reason for the worldwide flood, or that the roman catholic church is actually another synagogue of satan in disguise and has led millions to their doom (and plays an integral role in the coming 7 year tribulation period that begins shortly).</p>

<p>Your god is racist, homophobic, genocidal, and only supports the nation of Israel. You&#39;re insane if you follow this &quot;god&quot;.</p>

<p>Sin isn&#39;t moral wrongdoing, bible-thumper. It&#39;s genetic manipulation and materialistic lust. Your body is carbon-12 based. 6 protons, 6 neutrons, and 6 electrons. You are a creation of Satan and that&#39;s how we are born into &quot;sin&quot; without doing anything wrong.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey so I&#39;ve been reading your comments and I think you misunderstand the God of the old testament. Yes he is homophobic and all of those things you list. God sent Jesus so that we could all be Israelites. He now supports all people who follow Him. If we don&#39;t follow Him he will judge us for our sins. Jesus at this current moment in time wants us to love one another. There is no reason to hate or try and bring down anyone ever if we are believers in what Jesus teaches. If I have said anything wrong please let me know maybe I can clarify myself. The Bible is the word of God and cannot be manipulated by the devil in any way ever. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lets try to paint a scenario.</p>

<p>The book of revelation says about the Rule of the Antichrist, something like that. A type of government oppressive and controlling. Its resemblance with people call NWO/ One world govern is astounding.</p>

<p>Assuming that the Bible is a message to all mankind, thus, all mankind are being warned of this future, evil, government.</p>

<p>But, why aliens, some would ask.</p>

<p>Well, despite religious belief, many people are open to the fact that may/there is life on other planets. Much because the wide acceptance of the theory of evolution and the supposed age/size of the universe.</p>

<p>So, if, all of a sudden, there is a massive contact, and the aliens come out in the open saying: &quot;<em>We created you, we watched you, now its our time to come back and guide you through a brighter future?</em>&quot;</p>

<p>They, a  way more advanced civilization could help us to solve many problems like, pollution, hunger disease. And since sufficient advanced science is indistinguishable from magic, they could operate something the ancient would call miracles.</p>

<p>It would be game changing for all the world. People would embrace them in a blink. Many of the fights we have today would cease. They could unite people of all faiths (and lack of).</p>

<p>And what if those aliens put some rules for the things to work nice. Not bad huh? And what happens to those that not follow the rules? Hmm..</p>

<p>Its a possibility..</p>

<p>The bible tells us to not be deceived by people to preach a false gospel and the bible also tell us that those who deny Jesus Christ are the antichrist spirit.  Since the aliens deny Jesus Christ, that makes the aliens the antichrist spirit.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I find it very odd that the aliens are very focused on attack the bible and Jesus Christ.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For the answer to this one needs to look through the entire history of UFO lore but also Religious history. There are parallels between Angels &amp; Demons and &quot;Aliens&quot; which go back to the earliest ages. UFO flaps in 1500s France, etc. Not to mention biblical representations which are almost identical. </p>

<p>So then what one might deduce is that these are just different words for the same thing, but then one asks, where does the bible fit in? For that answer one would have to ignore recent translations and go back to the earliest, the original Greek manuscript and the Masoretic Leningrad texts. Now compare the variations and try to deduce the meaning in something that is not even original to begin with.</p>

<p>You may find a truly objective reasoning here impossible to find. Especially when the very translations or meanings are disputed by &quot;experts&quot;, who of course have their own allegiances. </p>

<p>It&#39;s very much like a dream, if you&#39;ve ever tried to read a book in a dream. The words and sentences are all there but when you try to read them they vanish. I think the French have an idiom for this, &quot;C&#39;est La Vie&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, I&#39;m pretty new to all the Bible, Torah and the OT vs NT. I&#39;m not going to do chapter and verse, just off the cuff - here goes:</p>

<p>In the end of times <em>it will be as in the days of Noah</em>. Now that is some really bad days! We&#39;re talking massive Giants that are eating everything out of the skies and walking on the earth! We&#39;re talking creatures that are cross breeding to be other bizarre creatures as half man half animal - literal! Beings that have perfected metal-works and building structures, practicing all kinds voodoo.</p>

<p>So, this dude Enoch is pretty chill and he gets onehelluva ride into the sky and he comes down and he says to Noah - get on that boat! Shut it up tight and wait for the <em>signs</em>.</p>

<p>Now, one of two things had to have happened: A seed slipped thru one of Noahs sons and their wives or God missed the Total Destruction...because some of the crazy big creepy dudes, half-animal dudes and the pervasive evil <em>persists</em> after Noah gets off the Boat.</p>

<p>Now Satan has dominion and he can throw what ever he wants at whomever he wants whenever he wants. If he chooses to use <em>living breathing persons</em> there&#39;s not much to stop him. </p>

<p>If I also got it straight, in the last days - the 200 Illuminated will be released as well as any others at his command from the abyss - so he could summon up some really scary looking creatures in the blink of an eye!</p>

<p>Do you believe every word in the Bible and Torah are <em>literal</em> and inspired words for teaching, instructing and correcting? </p>

<p>Can a person be baptized with tears? If you come across a person dying in the desert and you preach the gospel to them and they want to be baptized to seal the deal - will your tears work?</p>

<p>Mark 1:8 - I baptize you with water, but He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.&quot;</p>

<p>Acts 1:5 - For John baptized with water, but in a few days you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cool. At least we can ascertain that you&#39;re not a hardcore Catholic or some such derivation.</p>

<p>And no - I believe that evil and demons are real. I also believe that a conversation is much more conducive than simply throwing scripture around. You do not feed infants solids?</p>

<p>The first time I heard Jesus spoken it was by two dope smoking hippies and I was quite impressed. Yes. He&#39;s still a strong Christian Preacher and she has since passed. I helped with the photography on one of their first albums.</p>

<p>When Jesus spoke he didn&#39;t always sling scriptures - he used parables to bridge gaps (speaking to non believers...) rather than standing on a corner sounding a gong!</p>

<p>But slinging scriptures is your thing so more power to ya.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Scripture is a foundation of truth, I can&#39;t just speak from my own wisdom, otherwise it won&#39;t be from God.  I&#39;ll use scripture to backup the words I say, so people can have a well rounded understanding of what  I&#39;m saying.</p>

<p>Slinging scriptures aren&#39;t bad when it&#39;s true.  You asked a direct question and I gave a direct answer with scripture backing it up, there was no need for parables to explain it to you.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a time and place for using parables.</p>

<p>Did you explain why all of it had to be burned and cleansed when others asked about God being a genocidal baby killer...if you&#39;re trying to convert then insert some passion perhaps. If you&#39;re trying to teach then start with a story not judgement and accusations - you go crashing into others <em>houses</em> on the regular?</p>
