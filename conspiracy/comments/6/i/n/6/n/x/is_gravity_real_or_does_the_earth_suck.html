    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not certain about gravity, there seems to be a lot of evidence of it being fake. There is obviously some force that pushes us back up on the earth. I have zero evidence to prove it but if the earth does indeed move it&#39;s most likely constantly falling on us and we&#39;d have to be on the bottom of it. Wherever the stars are would have to be below us, it just looks &quot;up&quot; because of the tricks our brain pull. I&#39;ve done the math, it&#39;s much more likely we&#39;re in some sort of plasma field that slows us all down and it (the field) has to constantly be rising at a set rate to keep everything on the earth in place if the earth actually spins. I remember questioning when I was first told the earth rotates that it didn&#39;t make sense because I can&#39;t jump and be on another continent. If you flip everything you know inside out and upside down it&#39;s much more rational. I guess I&#39;m rambling a bit and I&#39;m not sure I&#39;m being coherent but hopefully that gives you a place to start</p>

<p>If you understood momentum, it would all become clear.</p>

<p>When you are standing still relative to the earth, you are actually moving laterally at over a 1,000 mph. When you jump, you&#39;re still moving laterally at over 1,000 mph, but you&#39;re now also moving vertically at a few mph.</p>

<p>The reason you do not end up on another continent is because you and the earth are spinning around at the same rate, and unless something hits you hard enough to stop you, you will keep spinning with the earth. That&#39;s the momentum I&#39;m talking about.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I admit my post wasn&#39;t entirely logical and stated that my post was mostly rambling; I&#39;d say thinking out loud. I do understand momentum but I can build a device that spins a ball to the point it&#39;s held in place and launch the ball straight up and it doesn&#39;t fall back in place. I try to consider ideas without axioms as I was in my previous post. Often I&#39;m wrong and I have no issue admitting that. I&#39;m not certain in this case and simply expressed my doubts in an admittedly incoherent way. I&#39;m much more accepting of the other users mention of electro magnetism being the cause than I am of gravity though, that&#39;s at least an experiment I can reproduce and achieve the same results as jumping off the ground.</p>

<p>I ask again, when they were measuring acceleration, what were they actually measuring, acceleration of what? It could not be gravity because we can not directly measure gravity.

    <div class="md"><p>You were the one who insist it is because of gravity without any proof and go on to riducule me as being stupid but you offer no proof of anything. Also you said that it does not matter what is the cause of the acceleration? Why the fuck would you say that and at the same time insist it is because of gravity?

    <div class="md"><p>dude - do you want to know how to measure the acceleration of gravity?</p>

<p>You can go do it yourself.</p>

<p>Go find a building a few hundred feet tall. Mark gradations on the side of the building. These will be important later on ;)</p>

<p>Go up to the top of the building with a bowling ball. Drop the ball and watch what happens.</p>

<p>1 second after you dropped the bowling ball - the ball will have travelled 9.8m.</p>

<p>2 seconds after you drop the ball - the ball will have travelled 9.8m times 3 or roughly 29.4 m.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a constant acceleration. It&#39;s a constant force that even YOU can go measure right now.</p>

<p>Record the bowling ball with a video camera and then play the video back after the ball hits the ground. Use the markings on the side of the building to confirm that the acceleration is constant.</p>

<p>That&#39;s all there is to it buddy. It&#39;s very simple math.</p>

<p>Acceleration equals delta velocity divided by delta time. </p>

<p>Go do that experiment and I assure you that you will come up with 9.8m/s/s.</p>

<p>That&#39;s how you measure gravity dude. It&#39;s something a child could do.</p>

<p>So you automatically believe in another explanation (density), which predicts nothing, without verifying the predictive ability of the first (gravity)?</p>

<p>I also believe electromagnetism is the key. </p>

<p>That&#39;s why people believe electromagnetism creates anti gravity, but it think is more along the lines of distortion I guess? Kinda like when you put north - south they move away from each other. So we pretty much just have to find a way to harness electromagnetism. Since it would always be relevant? Idk i actually need to look into more it&#39;s been bugging me lately.</p>

<p>I pretty much explained the plot of intersellar  to a friend before I even say the movie. We definitely need to harness it yo continue the evolution of the human race</p>
