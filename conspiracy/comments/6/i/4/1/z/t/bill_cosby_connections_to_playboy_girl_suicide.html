        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So Cosby has been back in the news recently. His case was ruled a mistrial, big surprise. Cosby has friends at the highest levels, he has information that could take down some huge people. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2857873/Passed-Bill-Cosby-Hugh-Hefner-dozens-Hollywood-honchos-Playboy-Playmate-Month-felt-used-abused-powerful-leading-men-took-gun-shot-head.html">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2857873/Passed-Bill-Cosby-Hugh-Hefner-dozens-Hollywood-honchos-Playboy-Playmate-Month-felt-used-abused-powerful-leading-men-took-gun-shot-head.html</a></p>

<p>Let&#39;s get started. Paige Young was a Playboy playmate of the month back in November of 1968. By 1974, she had been sexually abused so much at the hands of Hugh Hefner and Bill Cosby, that she ended up killing herself with a gun. She drew a pentagram in her own blood on the wall before killing herself, and had hundreds of pictures of Hugh Hefner. Immediately before her suicide, she had spent time out of the country with famous director John Huston, more on him later. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/film-news/11505950/playboy-mansion-jack-nicholson-secret-tunnels.html">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/film-news/11505950/playboy-mansion-jack-nicholson-secret-tunnels.html</a></p>

<p>Now here&#39;s where shit starts going from weird to terrifying. There are tunnels under the Playboy mansion connecting it to famous houses. For example, Jack Nicholson and Kirk Douglas. Douglas was accused of raping Natalie Wood, and is commonly thought of being responsible for her death, but there&#39;s little proof (sorry for Gawker source). </p>

<p><a href="http://gawker.com/5893793/did-robert-downey-jr-really-just-accuse-kirk-douglas-of-a-brutal-rape">http://gawker.com/5893793/did-robert-downey-jr-really-just-accuse-kirk-douglas-of-a-brutal-rape</a></p>

<p>Nicholson&#39;s house is far more ominous. It was at his house that Roman Polanski raped a 13 year old in a hot tub, back in 1977, and fled the country. </p>

<p>Roman Polanski made the film Chinatown, starring Jack Nicholson, a movie about a massive government conspiracy involving murder and billionaires. The main villain, Noah Cross, was an incestuous, child raping, pedophile, and was played by John Huston. Yup, the same John Huston Paige Young had been put of the country with immediately before killing herself in a satanic ritual. Polanski&#39;s other film, Rosemary&#39;s Baby, was about a woman becoming impregnanted by a satanic cult, made before his pregnant wife, Sharon Tate, was murdered by Charles Manson&#39;s cult. </p>

<p>I&#39;m sure this goes much deeper than just what I&#39;ve found. Kubrick&#39;s films were often about conspiracies, like Eyes Wide Shut, and he seemed to intentionally choose actors who were involved with Hollywood elite. Kirk Douglas was in Spartacus and Paths of Glory, Jack Nicholson was in the Shining, Scientologist Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman were in Eyes Wide Shut. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/gumshoenews.com/2017/05/14/nicole-kidmans-father-silenced-by-ninth-circle-satanic-cult/amp/">https://www.google.com/amp/s/gumshoenews.com/2017/05/14/nicole-kidmans-father-silenced-by-ninth-circle-satanic-cult/amp/</a></p>

<p>And finally, Ryan O&#39;Neal, who was in Barry Lyndon, was accused of violently beating Anjelica Huston (yup, John Huston&#39;s younger sister) who was dating Jack Nicholson at the time, and talks about Polanski&#39;s arrest in this article. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.pajiba.com/celebrities_are_better_than_you/anjelica-huston-alleges-that-ryan-oneal-beat-the-shit-out-of-her-talks-being-arrested-with-roman-polanski.php">http://www.pajiba.com/celebrities_are_better_than_you/anjelica-huston-alleges-that-ryan-oneal-beat-the-shit-out-of-her-talks-being-arrested-with-roman-polanski.php</a></p>

<p>Kubrick&#39;s death is very strange as well. It occurred on March 6th, 1999, the 66th day of the year, and exactly 666 days before January 1st, 2001, the dawn of the new millennium, his most famous film 2001, and the year 9/11 would occur, which most agree, was the start of the &quot;New Era&quot;. His last film, Eyes Wide Shut, was not released and some would argue it was not even finished. </p>

<p><a href="http://nofilmschool.com/2014/07/is-eyes-wide-shut-movie-kubrick-wanted-us-to-see">http://nofilmschool.com/2014/07/is-eyes-wide-shut-movie-kubrick-wanted-us-to-see</a></p>

<p>This seems like it was likely a response to the Satanic rituals of the elite and Rothschild parties of the 1970s, in fact the satanic party in the movie was even filmed at a Rothschild mansion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>FWIW, the original &quot;Playboy mansion tunnels&quot; story was revealed on the Playboy website on March 31st, 2015, and got huge media coverage.</p>

<p>On April 1st, all the photos and articles were removed from Playboy&#39;s site and replaced with a picture of Hugh Hefner with a placard reading &quot;April Fools!&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://etcanada.com/news/91301/update-secret-tunnels-under-playboy-mansion-nope-just-an-april-fools-prank-from-hef/">http://etcanada.com/news/91301/update-secret-tunnels-under-playboy-mansion-nope-just-an-april-fools-prank-from-hef/</a></p>

<p>There was very little follow up coverage of the fact the media had been played, yet again. Fake news. Or &quot;revelation of the method&quot; then covered up. </p>

<p>Since there are tunnels all over L.A. and Laurel Canyon (and New York, and Chicago, and many many places across the United States and Europe and the world), this story may be true, may be false, may be a huge PR success for Playboy and nothing more. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s interesting you bring up Laurel Canyon. Dave McGowan talked quite a lot about that area, and the possibility than bands from the 60s were actually CIA COINTELPRO, citing Jim Morrison&#39;s father&#39;s involvement with the Gulf of Tonkin, or the Beach Boys and their connections to the Manson family. A huge number of those people were NEVER drafted, despite being military age and having family in the military. </p>

<p>Eventually everything seems to lead back to Easy Rider, the film starting Peter Fonda, Jack Nicholson, and Dennis Hopper, their connections to Sharon Tate through Jane Fonda, weird parties they had, and Tate&#39;s murder at the hands of the Manson family.</p>
