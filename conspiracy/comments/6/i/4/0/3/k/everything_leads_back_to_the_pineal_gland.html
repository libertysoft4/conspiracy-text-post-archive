<p><a href="https://wikileaks.org/gifiles/docs/34/348834_fwd-copy-gray-no-joke-2-.html">Second email talks about &#39;pineal extract&#39;</a></p>

<p>I also apologize if this post doesn&#39;t make sense, I&#39;m working to add my explanations to back up my random connections!</p>

<p><strong>ORIGINAL POST</strong></p>

<p>I already know I am more than likely going to get pandered by A LOT of people if I don&#39;t present this information correctly, and therefore I&#39;ll apologize in advance if majority of my statements don&#39;t meet r/conspiracy criteria. This is my first post, so, here goes nothing.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been a huge avid lurker on this sub, and noticed that there are a lot of posts on here concerning the Pineal gland; and if its not directly referencing the gland, than its talking about ritual abuse in which the gland is involved via pedophile rings. So far, for the past few days, I&#39;ve been attempting to connect some dots to see if everything eventually leads back to the little pine-cone. </p>

<p>Here are some statements/questions I have so far from the notes I&#39;ve been jotting down as I go:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Pineal gland harvesting/mind control via the gland is subliminally hinted in a large number of dubbed &quot;cult&quot; films. Examples include: Eyes Wide Shut, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, They Live, A Clockwork Orange, The Shining, just to name a few. </p></li>
<li><p>The Skull &amp; Bones society have (and more than likely still do) ingest &#39;live&#39; Pineal gland during The Obscene Ritual. Who isn&#39;t to say that other secret Elite societies don&#39;t do similar rituals? Hell, maybe they mummify people themselves nowadays, just to preserve the gland and eat it during rituals. It&#39;s a stretch, but its not impossible. (see: <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/naomiastral/ancient-kemet/cannibalism-of-ancient-mummies---horrible-history">Link</a> for more information on the ritual)</p></li>
<li><p>More plausibly, the Elites of our society are putting fluoride in our water in order to speed up the calcification process of our own Pineal glands to keep us &#39;asleep&#39;, in a sense. In my opinion, this makes our minds more vulnerable and susceptible of mind control. MKULTRA programming can be implemented through our TV screens and we wouldn&#39;t even know. (see <a href="http://rense.com/general69/mass.htm">Link</a> for general hypothesis)</p></li>
<li><p>I was reading somewhere on / v / pizzagate that during ritual abuse, they violate the rectum because its more easy to manipulate the nerve endings that connect to the brain and pineal gland to put their slaves under mind-control. (see <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1583327">Link</a> for the post I&#39;m referring to)</p></li>
<li><p>But why would they need to cannibalize them as well? Because even in ancient society, the nobility believed that by ingesting another, they would achieve spiritual elevation and be able to talk to the gods. Maybe in the instances between life and death, our bodies (or brain more so) release some sort of psychedelic chemical that can cause hallucinations or open the third eye. That psychedelic would be DMT. (see <a href="http://wondergressive.com/death-solved-by-vestigial-gland/">Link</a> for more information)</p></li>
<li><p>There was another post here on this sub about HRC&#39;s tongue showing signs of Kuru diseases. As most of you know, Kuru happens when you are ingesting human flesh, particularly the brain, and occurs during funereal rituals or just straight up cannibal circle-jerk (see <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/673baf/hillary_clinton_has_symptoms_of_the_kuru_disease/">Link</a> for thread)</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>I&#39;ll update this later with more statements, meantime, tell me what you guys think so far</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>The pineal gland is something so overlooked. I believe ancient civilizations were more advanced and also appreciated and utilized this organ more than we do today. They knew the secrets it held, and the elite along with their secret societies have held it hostage from us to enslave us. There&#39;s also a blatant war on for our level of consciousness and higher enlightenment through control of psychedelics; all of which open the pineal gland. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very true. I read somewhere on here earlier this week that they put fluoride in our water to protect us from possession/opening gateways to other dimensions with our minds, but what if they&#39;re doing that to protect themselves? It reminds me of Clive Barke&#39;s novel Imajica; the elites of humanity wanted to harvest magic for themselves, and took it away from the casual man, but ended up getting cut off from the rest of dimensions for it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>From what I have been reading, Egyptians used to this same thing. They would scoop out the pineal gland through the nose, put it in a jar to preserve it and eat it for both spiritual and health reasons. They believed they could be healed by it. Also, maybe S&amp;B were eating the pineal gland harvested from those mummies, because the Egyptians actually mastered all of the glands. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll do some more looking into, just to make sure, though!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was not bad before. Just not great, not strong, I did not enjoy the gym. A month later and I am back to levels before I ever got Lyme. For me the iodine has restored my health and hopefully will continue to see gains. If not I will stop. The meditation, also helps. It&#39;s a journey not a destination. Little by little I have made adjustments, feeling good can be addicting!</p>

It&#39;s really easy to take a psychedelic and do some whippits and see every answer in the universe, but once you come &quot;down&quot; into earth&#39;s difficult frequency, it&#39;s just chaos again. The point is how do we bring that magical &quot;oneness&quot; into our everyday reality. DMT showed me the world from a 6th dimensional perspective, where time and space were as malleable as the water, and our intentions dictate creation just like a dream. If anything DMT will show you that life is but a small part of experiential consciousness, it&#39;s an incredible level of awareness. </p>

    <div class="md"><p><em>Ideally</em>... Eat vegan, cut processed foods out of your diet, cut flouride out, drink water and plenty of it, and exercise regularly. Also helps to practice mindfulness, meditation and/or yoga.<br/>
But obviously you don&#39;t have to jump right into all of this. If you want to decalcify your Pineal gland and do none of the above then you&#39;d want to ease yourself in. Start with cutting down meat and dairy and drinking more water, that kinda thing. Transition yourself into it or you&#39;d give your body a hell of a shock. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Before the retreat of the forests in Africa, which gave way to the savannahs and plains we see today, humans would eat almost exclusively fruits, vegetables and nuts. Hunting only became a necessity when those resources were no longer in abundance. Meat and dairy is a good way of getting a big dump of protein and some nutrients, but it comes with drawbacks. Cholesterol, animal fats, etc. Meat and dairy undeniably increase your risk of contracting heart and circulatory system related diseases. We can, and previously did, get <em>all</em> or required nutrients from plants, and we can do so without the risk of those diseases. Just because we can eat animal products doesn&#39;t mean we need to.<br/>
Also as an extra addition, veganism is probably the best thing you, as an individual, can do for the environment second to not having kids.<br/>
I could get weird and spiritual about souls and how eating animals affects you on a soul level... But without putting in the effort to back up what I say with silly amounts of examples, analogies and all that I may just come across as a crazy person haha.</p>

<p>Cholesterol is not inherently bad. In fact you need cholesterol in your diet to maintain a healthy lipid profile.</p>

<p>Eating animal products is perfectly safe when included as a part of a balanced diet. Limiting red meats, and keeping your protein intake to primarily poultry, fish, and other white meats all but eliminates any risks from meat consumption, while also allowing you to maintain a healthier physique and lifestyle.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Eat vegan? Would you rather be the lion or the lamb.   </p>

<p>Vegans do not get all the macro-nutrients that humans need. Plus there are a ton of anti-nutrients in beans, nuts, and seeds that vegans must consume to make their diet balanced. Plus they end up eating way to much sweets to just have enough energy to get through the day. And let me not start on the amount of tooth decay.  </p>

<p>You are better off eating grass fed beef/lamb, free range chicken/eggs, full fat butter/dairy, cold water fish, a plethora of multi-colored vegetables, fruits, and healthy fats. Don&#39;t forget your prebiotics and probiotics like kefir, apple cider vinegar, sauerkraut, sour pickles, natto, miso, kombucha, etc. Supplement with a variety of teas to help with your specific needs, diatomaceous earth, bee pollen/propolis/royal jelly, etc. Do not eat any grains, nuts, seeds, beans, lentils without, sprouting, fermenting, or soaking/cooking first (keep them to a minimum).</p>

<p>Stop eating bread/pasta. All bread and flours in the USA use bromide (it doesn&#39;t even need to be listed on the label as per the FDA). If you want bread, make your own ezekiel or sourdough with bromide free flours instead. All those red dots/bumps we have on our bodies, are called Cherry Angiomas they come from bromide toxicity.  </p>

<p>Get yourselves some Lugol&#39;s Iodine to kick the bad halogens (chlorine, bromine, fluorine) out of your thyroid and pineal gland.   </p>

<p>Clean fresh water. I use mostly distilled water, and drink a couple teas a day.</p>

<p>I get your position on that animals have souls, but there is proof that even plants have feelings. As long as your meat is sacrificed humanly there is no excess Cortisol and stress hormones in the meat and won&#39;t effect you negatively (research autist Temple Grandin, she knew all about this). This is why HALAL meat should be avoided at all cost as the way they slaughter the meat, it pumps extra Adrenalin and Cortisol in their flesh which then you ingest and becomes part of you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Personally when I was 17 and getting into cannabis and mysticism, I learned about the power of vibrations, specifically through chanting, certain tones that resonate with the pineal gland so I learned how to om and I practiced until I felt the om resonate throughout my whole head I expiremented with my voice the volume and strength of the tone. Once I was confident in my chants I began the specific third eye opening chant spelled like Thoth but pronounced by saying the word toe loudly carrying the old sound and ending the champ with the th sound letting your tongue come between your two front teeth bottom and upper teeth let your tongue kind of stick between them almost like you&#39;re making a whistling noise but just the th noise the source for this ritual was a book called ancient teachings for beginners the book specifically warned against using this chant more than 3 times after your first attempt as this vibration is powerful and once your third eye AKA pineal gland is opened it will not serve you to chant any longer after this you go on to strengthen your crown chakra by chanting the word May this also is powerful and should not be used more than once or twice a week these two chants will allow your third eye and Crown chakra to synchronize and you should feel a change in your pineal gland this of course also must be supplemented with fresh alkaline water you can add fresh squeezed lemon juice to your water if you do not have access to alkaline water.</p>

<p>I successfully perform this chant I lost Consciousness and felt a white light pervade over my senses I was still aware of my body yet my mind was unlike anything I&#39;ve experienced before I felt a calm serenity and noticed a difference in my life afterwards namely a heightened sense of synchronicity or coincidence after this I became much more spiritual and I felt more than ever before that I could actually pray and communicate with something higher than myself for the longest time I had been an Atheist but opening my pineal gland with the thoth chant gave me a stronger awareness of my place in the universe cannabis might have helped play a part in this but I have never felt anything like this experience from Cannabis alone I strongly suggest changing your diet trying these chants and possibly finding the book if you&#39;re interested let me know and I&#39;ll find out more information on that book for you</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes that is the most important aspect and theres always psychedelics if you want to &quot;supplement&quot;, I just think &#39;decalcification of pineal gland via Iodine etc&#39; is a theory without any real scientific evidence. If you are talking meditation.. now there is something that works. Nonetheless, re: evidence - science does not have all the answers, so it could work for some, could work for a placebo for some, not work for some, worked but not recognised, and not considered by many. It didn&#39;t do anything differently for me, I think there is a lot of placebo effect involved and more important factors are what get you &quot;there&quot; - whatever you may define is there e.g. higher states of consciousness</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Heard.</p>

<p>I have noticed what felt like the Iodine &#39;working&#39;. On multiple occasions I&#39;ve heard and felt a tiny little &#39;squeak&#39; of air/liquid moving around in my forehead around the gland after taking Iodine. It&#39;s very subtle, but noticeable, and I&#39;ve only noticed it happening when taking Iodine.</p>

<p>On top of that, I notice a general increased mental clarity when I take my Iodine in the morning compared to when I don&#39;t.</p>

<p>May very well be placebo though.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I think it&#39;s worth it. As far as supplements go, Iodine is one of the cheapest. I&#39;m still on my first bottle, and I bought it months ago.</p>

<p>Actually the best way to ingest DMT is by making a tea and actually digesting versus wasting it by smoking. People dont understand that smoking DMT is a waste. Its basically a joint versus edible argument. </p>

<p>As to your argument there is a synthesized version of Adrenochrome but taking a synth version of a drug is basically smoking spice for the effect of weed or snorting bath salths for the effect of coke which both are horrible at doing. You always want the real shit versus some synth fake stuff. </p>

<p>You want adrenochrome because supposedly its like taking a shot of adrenaline with the same and longer and more profound effects of DMT. Everyone reports the wrong feelings or not feeling it because what they get is synths and not the actual stuff. Now you can imagine that getting your hands on a pineal gland that is clean and not rotted out by today&#39;s toxins is very difficult. Its also difficult because to get the max you need to basically ruin a person mentally that their heart is about to burst and you collect the pineal gland at that climax point. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It what I&#39;ve came to the conclusion of. To keep the people asleep they poison them. That&#39;s why they use children or have &quot;breeders&quot; for them. More pure peneal glands and easier to get the climax out of. Stronger hearts and easier to scare. It&#39;s a horrible sickening thing.</p>

<p>BUT we have DMT. A normal occurring molecule. There is actually a a movie on Netflix called &quot; DMT:The spirit molecule&quot; which is a great first dive into it. But it&#39;s a easier gather than a pineal gland and waaaaayyyyy less innocent than harvesting them. DMT comes from Ayahuasca and those are trees. So we can plant and re harvest. DMT is a concentrate like hash oil is to weed.</p>

<p>I would add on to the potential to search other toxic little chemicals out there that are found in water, processed foods, everyday products and also see if those are known to calcify or breakdown the pineal gland.

    <div class="md"><p>I think the reason why a lot of people find this topic to be far-fetched is because of 1) the way we are programmed to ridicule such &#39;conspiracy theories&#39; 2) our lack of understanding on the nature of our reality.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“If you want to find the secrets of the universe, think in terms of energy, frequency and vibration.”
― Nikola Tesla</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We live in a sea of energy, vast majority of which we cannot directly perceive. This is how all things in existence influence each other and co-exist. This idea of interconnection is also represented our social construction as well (theory of six degrees of separation).</p>

<p>If you want to control the entire human race, you infect the sea with your agenda so that it propagates globally (media, disinformation, govt policies, cultural narrative, terrorist attacks...)</p>

<p>Once you realise that these people in power share such occult knowledge in their secret societies whilst manipulating the public into thinking that such claims are ludicrous (age of science), it becomes much easier to accept the fact that these satanic rituals that they carry out actually hold significance. </p>

<p>So it makes sense to me that everything leads to this... </p>

<p>Their rituals are a symbolic representation of what they&#39;re doing to the human race. It&#39;s about their control, deception, corruption and distortion of what is natural. It&#39;s a celebration of how they&#39;re turning Earth into a purgatory.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a bad idea, because you are gonna be public. These people will see you as a threat, if you gain any real kind of ability to affect change. If you want to actually change the world then you need to be underground. Learn about technology and how it can be used against you, to track, surveile you, or plant information, or blackmail you. Don&#39;t form any organization that can be track or indentified. They will kill you if you do. Also if you do get extreamly lucky, don&#39;t start thinking you&#39;re wise enough to change the world or manipulate things. That&#39;s how we got in the situation we did. Republic&#39;s were compromised to make way for socialism, and facism, and atheism. </p>

<p>I&#39;d add, too, the Drug War is a big part of keeping the secret knowledge from people. I&#39;ve been lucky to smoke DMT many times, so I&#39;ve interacted with discarnate higher intelligences and seen things that don&#39;t translate into words. But most people haven&#39;t, and we&#39;re the product of our experiences; if you&#39;ve pretty much just drank alcohol your whole life, you&#39;re not likely to be interested in the ancient secrets and the spiritual nature of reality. This is a big part of why I&#39;m an anti-drug war activist.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Weed is a tool to be used somewhat infrequently. It does expand your mind but over use leads to diminishing returns. Meditating (breath awareness style)  on a daily basis can counter act the negative consequences of weed abuse. Think of weed as a sacred plant with wisdom to share and you&#39;ll be in the right frame of mind to use it. Unfortunately most ppl see it as a way to get high which I believe misses the point. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Kinda late for reacting but anyway;
I am in the same situation as you, i smoke to much for using my pinael gland. 
I smoke 15 years now with two breaks of a year and like you said i dont dream anymore. Feels like my consciousnis is gone...
i have high functioning autism and thats why i smoke but i cant regulate myself. I used to do it only weekends and i remember after i smoked a little bit i predicted a movie i never seen before, my friends didnt believed what they saw...
I had always the feeling i could read/feel other peoples emotions, i could fell if somethings going to happen....but that was only if i smoked like very little.
One day a house doctor visiting specialised in energy fields and stones and stuff literally came up to me and said ; i feel you have a sixth sense , it was the first time she saw me and it baffled me she said that....
Then i tried reading stuff about it but then i started smoking everyday and shit hit the fan.</p>

<p>But smoking to much for that long just ruined my consciousness and i want it back. I wanna quit smoking and try opening my third eye again and regulate it correctly with weed but thats hard thing to do when i am mentally addicted to it...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I struggle to regulate too. If I could have one a night or just on weekends I would. Even if I could buy it in smaller quantities for just a weekend. But if it&#39;s there and I&#39;m home then I&#39;m smoking it and if I run out I can&#39;t sleep or anything. So it&#39;s hard to achieve any balance. For me it seems to be daily or not at all. It&#39;s a shame. I feel the same. The brain is rotting. I&#39;m not half as intelligent as I used to be. Kind of hurts, emotionally. We would probably be best to just quit but of course it&#39;s not that easy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah i feel exactly the same about my intelligence...i feel ashamed also and guilty if i am stoned but i do this for 15 years so it cant be good mentally.</p>

<p>And still its like you said i cant go a day without its like i am in another dimension and when i stop smoking my whole body hurts mentally and physically.. 
I want my life back and my memories also. 
Last year i stopped for eight months but i relapsed,
In the beginning it went oke i had controle over myself and i smoked only smoked like 1 sticky icky in the weekend and that was absolute bliss.
Then one time i smoked more than one joint and it was like a switch in my head and i needed weed to feel good even though most of the time i feel worse when i smoke...
For me it has some benefits smoking autisme wise but the other effects are just killing me.
It makes me feel i am throwing away my life, my social skills, my future job, girlfriend..
Sometimes i get a clear moment and its like yes i am gonna quit and then when the weed runs out i panick because i cant get no sleep.
But did you now because you smoke alot when you sleep your brains wont go into the important phase of REM sleep, thats why every morning i feel exhausted and i barely sleep good anymore because i have problems with insomnia.
So yes the only good thing is quiting but i dont drink beer or something else so my life is so boring then.
I am gonna try quiting for a few weeks and try to regulate again, and hope it works because if you can do that its heaven.
Srry for the long answer.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s all the same as me. The only difference is autism but I do score high on the autism test. Always wonder if I am mildly so. If not the weed makes me it in some ways. Never go out, struggle socially now, etc. 
But with regards to quitting. I have quit on numerous occasions through my life. Sometimes for a week or two. Some times for a few months. Once for about a year. I feel it&#39;s all about your own mindset with regards to quitting and feeling ready to quit. Everytime I&#39;ve been successful it&#39;s been when I&#39;ve felt sick of weed or bored of it. Somehow in my heart I&#39;ve always known when I can and can&#39;t quit and if I&#39;m forcing it then I will not sleep. If I&#39;m embracing it I sleep fine and feel proud of my clear mind. I can&#39;t explain the differences but I think you&#39;ll know what I mean by this. So don&#39;t force yourself if not ready. Instead note all the negatives as you smoke it until you feel sick of it and want to quit somewhat joyfully to improve your life. It will work out better. 
I also do no other drugs at all. It&#39;s just weed and tobacco. No drinking or pills or anything. So I feel losing weed is losing my ability to unwind to some degree. But you have to give it up eventually. What will we be in another 15 years if we don&#39;t? We already feel notably dumber, less social, paranoid, etc. Imagine doubling it all. We&#39;ll be ruined. And the truth is it is easy to quit in the right frame of mind. You just have to get there first and then never smoke it again. 
We think our lives are boring without weed but the truth is weed makes it boring too. Don&#39;t forget that. It can make staying in less depressing to do but no more exciting than it was anyway. Just bearable. 
I read The Easy Way To Stop Smoking by Alan Carr once and quit smoking everything for about a year. It may work for you if you want to quit cigs too. He encourages you to smoke throughout the book, so it&#39;s not like you are forced to quit at any point to continue reading. You smoke until it&#39;s read and then decide if you haven&#39;t already. 
Anyway. All the best, man. Try not to waste another 15 years. I will too. After the next bag. lol </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Youre correct about the right mindset, a few weeks ago i quited for like 2 days lol, it felt like heaven i was relaxed and had a good night sleep and remembered my dreams.
I have the feeling my dreams are important for me to put everything in place mentally because fantasy and real life has always been a problem separating the two.
But everyday i am tired, unmotivated when i smoke, they say it relaxes the muscles but i have more muscle pain then ever before.
And still i dont tell myself to quit its like my body is in self destruct mode because life doesnt have much to offer for me, i think its boring.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Does ingesting too much calcium cause/worsen calcification of the pineal gland? I ask this because the American Medical Association really pushes women to take calcium supplements. However, the average American gets plenty of calcium through typical diet and doesn&#39;t need a supplement. Too much calcium causes soft tissue to harden, causing problem like bone spurs and hardening of the arteries. The tremendous rise in heart disease in women is directly correlated with the push for women to ingest too much calcium. </p>

<p>I also read on another post here that iodine helps to counteract fluoride. That is a supplement most Americans don&#39;t get enough of. Iodine dissipates out of salt, so an open container of salt doesn&#39;t have nearly as much iodine as you are lead to believe. While many, many, many thongs can cause high cholesterol, for most Americans, its a result of not enough iodine intake. But the AMA gives you statins, which  only mask problems instead of fix them and have terrible side effects, rather than tell you to take an iodine supplement.</p>

<p>I believe the AMA deliberately gives bad nutritional advice to ensure that people develop chronic diseases that keep their doctors in business. But now I&#39;m wondering if suppressing the pineal gland could be part of the agenda, too? I dunno. Just a thought. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, Big Pharma&#39;s whole agenda is about making the health sick and the sick, sicker, in order to generate revenue. Personally, a lot diseases and health issues we have are because of the things that AMA has told us will &quot;make us better&quot;. If you try house-hold remedies or anything natural, your health issues will more than likely go away as soon as they come. The reason why I focused so much with the Pineal gland in my post is due to it being the reason why we &quot;dream&quot; and our have a subconscious while we sleep. By slowly calcifying it overtime, it would allow our government easy influences on what we dream about and how we perceive things. Atleast, thats what I hypothesized so far!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You cant really understand the occult without first understanding the link between human anatomy and spirituality.</p>

<p>-anal sodomy- the reason anal sex is used is related to the location of the root chakra and its housing of Kundalini. Enlightenment is achieved by harnassing and opening all chakra energies at once, once all 7 are activated the pineal gland is also activated and floods the brain with DMT - this is enlightenment - being able to open them all at once on command is true enlightenment. Anal sex stimulates the root chakra and forces Kundalini to awaken and activate all chakras at once - this is called a Kundalini Awakening. This is usually a temporary form of enlightenment traditionally used for training, but Masters/Reincarnated can use Tantra(sex meditation) or Pranayama(breathing meditation) to quickly re-achieve full enlightenment through the awakening of Kundalini. True Tantra and Pranayama techniques are a sacred secret shared only between yogi and disciples - the occult will never have access to these humane forms of forced enlightenment. The goal of the occult is to release the DMT and then consume it to &quot;steal&quot; the enlightenment- they use sodomy as means to force the victim into a Kundalini awakening so the DMT/Adrenaline can be released and then consumed via pineal/blood.</p>

<p>The goal of Fluoride in water isnt to calcify the pineal gland - it is to disrupt the Throat chakra by throttling the Thyroid. If you look at modern food/pesticides/water/BPA/etc. all of these fuck with the Thyroid - the Thyroid/throat chakra is the &quot;dam&quot; between the body and brain. By limiting the free flow of chemicals from body to brain, our neurochem (DMT/dopamine/serotonin/norepinephrine) levels are lowered and ALL of our &quot;natural abilities&quot; are reduced. You can temporarily break this &quot;dam&quot; with drugs - this is why the occult will dose victims with strong narcotics. The &quot;flood&quot; of chemicals breaks the thyroid &quot;dam&quot; and allows free flow to the brain, this enables the body to more easily attain enlightenment until the drugs wear off and the thyroid is closed off once again due to these poisons.</p>

<p>Tobacco, Amphetamines, Coca, Khat increase all levels of dopa/sero/norep</p>

<p>Norepinephrine (Adrenaline) controls hyper focus/apex warrior/fear
-to increase these levels exercise, fight, hunt
-children have the highest adrenaline lvls</p>

<p>Dopamine controls intuition
-drink wine
-smoke weed or consume hemp regularly</p>

<p>Serotonin controls Oneness/Christ Consciouness/Love
-LSD/MDMA, prayer
-memory recall - meditate on a pure happy memory, the warm fuzzy feeling is Christ Consciousness/Love</p>

<p>DMT controls connection to Spirit aka Hashamayim aka Holy Waters above and below
-Mushrooms/Aya/Mescaline, enlightenment, meditation</p>

<p>To see through (((their))) bullshit and pseudoscience you have to have both medical knowledge of human anatomy as well as a willingness to try &quot;illegal substances&quot; numerous times to fully understand their effects. Everything they are doing in these rituals is to maximize the potency of these neuro chemicals in the blood of their victims. What they are doing with the high I dont know? Most of the profound wisdom found during DMT trips is lost due to time/memory dilation - a 15min vaped DMT trip can feel like a thousand years. If the reptilian shit turns out to be true, it may be a means for maintaining physical presence in our &quot;world&quot;. I really dont know though? I achieved enlightenment the normal way and recreated it through &quot;scientific experimentation&quot; with drugs - this is most of what I have picked up and reasoned out. Limiting the Throat Chakra is the key though, through sound we are able to achieve enlightenment.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The thyroid acts like a filter between the body&#39;s circulatory system and the brain, most notably controlling and limiting hormones. But, one of THE primary functions of a healthy thyroid is to produce calcitonin, which regulates and controls calcium levels in your blood. If this function of the thyroid were to be disrupted we would see an elevated level of calcium in the blood - and this is exactly how your pineal gland is being shut off.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, that was a fascinating post. I hear you on the throat chakra bit- that is really interesting. </p>

<p>I&#39;m a DMT user and advocate myself, and I just have one curious question- what do you mean by &quot;the goal of the occult is to release the DMT and then consume it&quot;? Really, what did you mean by that? Should I take it literally? Because I&#39;m skeptical. I imagine that they- they being dark, powerful, &quot;occult&quot; forces- do tests on DMT, but I doubt they take it themselves. To do so would mean interacting directly with the force they hate and are attempting to conquer. Call it &quot;Gaia&quot; or whatever intelligence is behind DMT. I think it&#39;s our mother. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You should take their &quot;consumption&quot; very literally, and I hope my reasoning makes some sane sense.</p>

<p>When we consume DMT we are doing so via brewed Aya or vaping crystalized DMT - we have to refine and extract the drug from its organic form first. The same can be said when the human body is observed as the organic matter, something must be done in order to &quot;activate&quot; the DMT within the pineal gland. When I realized ritual abuse was being conducted on a massive scale I became incredibly curious - why? </p>

<p>We are talking about a serious crime against humanity and God by an echelon that has everything - what could possibly be worth this risk? There is no way this was ever just sexual degeneracy, you have to be ten ways fucked in the head to torture&gt;kill&gt;consume - OR - you have to know there is some reward involved that is not attainable in any other way, if it were they would just buy it (and they probably do). When these people drug and torture victims they are hyper saturating the blood with adrenaline and a cocktail of narcotics - they dont care if the victim overdoses at the end, its meal prep. This is where the pseudoscience/occult comes in - activating Kundalini via root chakra stimulation triggers the pineal gland to release DMT. The blood/organs have now synthesized all the drugs naturally, consumption at this point would result in a very very very strong high, which is likely why we read of them &quot;sharing&quot; the victims - its just too much drugs for one person. When you factor in they use children, the result is even higher levels of adrenaline in the blood and a &quot;fresh&quot; pineal gland untouched by societal poisons.</p>

<p>You assume the spirit realm DMT takes us to has morality, we both know this to be false. Malevolent beings are just as prevelant in the DMT realm, we are just somehow able to circumvent them. I dont know who or what they might be interacting with, I dont even know if they are consuming the DMT for the &quot;journey&quot; so to speak. I truly believe we have no understanding of the why because we dont know the limits of DMT. But when you add in all the rituals and mantras they use during the torture/rape phase, there is undoubtedly some reason for it. What that reason is I can only imagine, but Im guessing it feeds into some higher power because why go through all the extra occult steps if you just want a cannibalism high?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There was a time my third eye was opened via a psych drug the doctors won&#39;t ever tell you about.  It was supposed to be an antidepressant and was effective for that.  At the time, some fellow students paid too much attention to me at art school, and looking back I guess they worked for an intelligence agency.  One of them suggested a way to meditate which made the inner eye reveal crystal clear, random and bizarre visions, and the same technique sometimes made a blazing dot of light appear and enlarge to seem as though looking straight at the sun, and sometimes from that I&#39;d go someplace absolutely pure white. </p>

<p>There&#39;s so much more, but &quot;reality&quot; is way more complicated than the everyday world, and there are people who are very adept at manipulating it.  They don&#39;t need sodomy or mummified pineal glands to do it, but these fallacies might be used to keep people misinformed and confused.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We all still have the ability, but sometimes it requires drugs to open a mind to know it exists.  We&#39;ve been taught there&#39;s no such thing as magic, but you can become aware of the depths of reality and its flexibility and what&#39;s possible and that absolute knowledge/belief is what enables it.  <em>Not</em> believing makes it impossible.  One you find out it&#39;s real (no matter how) it becomes part of your reality and perception of it.  The problem might be you can&#39;t shut it off.  (It reminds me of when you&#39;re a kid and someone tells you not to mess with a Ouiga board, but it&#39;s true-once that door is open you can never close it.)</p>

<p>I&#39;ll look at r/pinealgate, but things experienced actually would require a detailed narrative of hundreds of pages.  A lot of stuff is written down but disorganized....</p>

<p>What many of these films have in common, is that Kubrick made them. Doctor Strangelove is also worth mentioning here. (One of the main characters talks a lot about fluoridation of water, and how harmful it is. I wasn&#39;t expecting to hear this in that film, btw. I watched it recently.) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Additional statements:</p>

<p>*A lot of articles surrounding DMT and Adrenachrome state that they can only be found (I&#39;ll assume these are a much more potent and natural, pure extraction) in the adrenaline and pineal glands. However, mention it on here and they&#39;re all make believe drugs.</p>

<p>*I was reading a post on / v / concerning ritual abuse and it says that great trauma and fear must be inflicted in order for the slave to be controlled. Its because by tampering with the nerve endings of the spinal cord connection to the brain, your causing it to produce too many chemicals at once which induces mild hallucination. Aleister Crowley is reported to have done this during his rituals.</p>

<p>*This is going to sound far-fetched, but ancient civilizations were both technologically and spiritually advanced than we are. They discovered interstellar travel (Norse mythology&#39;s Bifrost &amp; Yggdrasil) and interdimensional travel. This would explain why architecture from the old worlds looked impossible for the time period. </p>

<p>*The Eye of Horus looks similar to Pineal gland if analysized closely. Its clear that ancient cultures worshipped the fuck out of this thing, but why? Gateway to the soul. But why were they so obsessed with the concept of soul? What were they trying to achieve by doing these rituals and why are they still being practiced today?</p>

<p>I&#39;ll update with links later!</p>

<p>Can you say where in these films? The only one I know of is Fear and Loathing where they talk about adenochrome and the adrenal gland (totally different). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In the movie The Shining, they use a sort of telepathy to communicate with eachother (the son and the owner of the Hotel) I took this an interpretation of attributing&#39;s ones enlightenment to another. The son in the movie also had a prophetic dream (as many have reported when starting the decalcifying process/enlightenment via the pineal gland).</p>

<p>In They Live, they were using a radio signal in order to block out our perception of reality. The glasses in the movie symbolized our Third Eye/Pineal Gland opening up to view the world as it really was without the blockage.</p>

<p>In Eyes Wide Shut, during the scene that Tom Cruise&#39;s character is prowling the night, its a brief instance, but we see the All Seeing Eye watching him or as how I interpreted it as him becoming enlightened to what was really around him and his perception of reality &#39;changed&#39;. The same can be said for A Clockwork Orange.</p>

<p>In the movie, he is subjected to an MKULTRA type mind control that prevents him from acting the way he truly is. It isn&#39;t until he goes through a tremendous amount of trauma and stress that he &#39;awakens his true self again&#39; and sees that he was never cured in the first place.</p>

<p>However, this is all my own personal interpretation! Hopefully, that answers it. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Did you know that the alkaloid of DMT is actually a
neurotransmitter like LSD 25 and 5-MEODMT, psylocin A + B and all
psychadelic drugs because the definition of psychadelia is a
neurotransmitter that the metabolite itself thereof creates a
kaleidoscopic vision of geometric proportions in the pea and pea or
whatever attachment to the pineal gland there is with light cones OR
rods also depending on genetics, and depending on genetics the
chromosomal filtration of certain neurotransmitters within these
rods or cones which also illustrate in the visual cortex apparently</p>

<p>As someone previously mentioned about 2 weeks ago, its like wanting the purest form of crack, cocaine, LSD, weed, and etc. Yeah, sure, you&#39;re getting DMT, but are the effects the same as they are compared to extracting the gland(s) from a young child fearing for his/her life? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, Big Pharma&#39;s whole agenda is about making the health sick and the sick, sicker, in order to generate revenue. Personally, a lot diseases and health issues we have are because of the things that AMA has told us will &quot;make us better&quot;. If you try house-hold remedies or anything natural, your health issues will more than likely go away as soon as they come. The reason why I focused so much with the Pineal gland in my post is due to it being the reason why we &quot;dream&quot; and our have a subconscious while we sleep. By slowly calcifying it overtime, it would allow our government easy influences on what we dream about and how we perceive things. Atleast, thats what I hypothesized so far!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Youre correct about the right mindset, a few weeks ago i quited for like 2 days lol, it felt like heaven i was relaxed and had a good night sleep and remembered my dreams.
I have the feeling my dreams are important for me to put everything in place mentally because fantasy and real life has always been a problem separating the two.
But everyday i am tired, unmotivated when i smoke, they say it relaxes the muscles but i have more muscle pain then ever before.
And still i dont tell myself to quit its like my body is in self destruct mode because life doesnt have much to offer for me, i think its boring.</p>
