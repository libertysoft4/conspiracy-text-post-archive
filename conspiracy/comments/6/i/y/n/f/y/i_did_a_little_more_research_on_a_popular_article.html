        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This was a trend recently on FB, and other social media platforms.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2017/06/16/coconut-oil-isnt-healthy-its-never-been-healthy/402719001/">https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2017/06/16/coconut-oil-isnt-healthy-its-never-been-healthy/402719001/</a></p>

<p>It was posted on many other sites as well. But I will stick with USA today&#39;s. It doesn&#39;t really matter, because they are all the same.</p>

<p>Anyone who follows me, will know that I am a big stickler on MSM. Especially their lack of including sources. </p>

<p>Did anyone notice the giant red flag right as you started to read?
If not, it was the video. Why would a study group have to money to make an anti-coconut oils video? They were just doing a study right? If they had the money to make a video as well, than it would suggest that the funders of this study were anti-coconut oil as well.</p>

<p>These days, I can spot a fake news article miles away. And usually I will pass on them. I have no interest in corporate interests. But this dis-info campaign hit close to home with me.</p>

<p>I found this very interesting, because my daughter has a rare disorder where her body can not process long-chain fats, and needs to rely on medium-chain fats. We have a special doctors for this, but more importantly, we are required to meet with a group of university dieticians. Both of these told me that my daughter requires MCT. But also that coconut oil would be a suitable substitution. Yet this article refutes those claims made by specialist doctors, and dieticians. So I looked into this article, and this is what I found.</p>

<p>The lead author of this report, Dr. Frank Sacks has no Wiki. So I can not look much into his life, or his real opinions. But what I can find, is that he has created his own &quot;diet&quot; plan. And this seems like a promotion for said diet.</p>

<p>&quot;Frank Sacks, lead author on the report, said he has no idea why people think coconut oil is healthy. It&#39;s almost 100% fat. Past weight loss studies might be responsible. &quot;</p>

<p>This is correct. And this broad term applies to all oils. And is complete mis-info. The difference is that coconut oil has medium-chain fats, and the main oils (whose owners probably helped fund this) had long-chain fats. And long chain fats are the bad type. Also, past weight loss studies may be responsible because anyone who is serious about losing weight, and sees a certified dietician will switch their fats to medium chain fats. Looks at the diets of Tom Brady, and Giselle for example.</p>

<p>“The reason coconut oil is so popular for weight loss is partly due to my research on medium chain triglycerides,&quot; which they dispute with &quot;St-Onge&#39;s research used a &quot;designer oil&quot; packed with 100% MCTs. Traditional coconut oil only contains about 13 to 15%&quot;</p>

<p>And yet, they never discuss Carnitine palmitoyltransferase II which is the main enzyme that breaks down the long-chain fats. Also if you simply do some research you will find that &quot;Traditional coconut oil&quot; contains 62-65% MCTs.</p>

<p>The article concludes with the fact that &quot;people who cut saturated fat out of their diet might not necessarily lower their heart disease risk... ...That&#39;s because some people fill the void with sugar, white flour and empty calories.&quot; Which dismisses the whole point.</p>

<p>Lastly it goes on to recommend vegetable oil, or Olive oil. Are you joking me! Look at some real scientific studies on those. Not the ones that are paid for by big agriculture. This mans &quot;diet&quot; is literally the old &quot;Food Pyramid&quot; you learned about in grade school. And that has been proven to be sponsored by agricultural interest. Not real health interests.</p>

<p>Now let&#39;s go even deeper. Here is a link to the American Heart Association report that triggered the news articles:</p>

<p><a href="http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/circulationaha/early/2017/06/15/CIR.0000000000000510.full.pdf">http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/circulationaha/early/2017/06/15/CIR.0000000000000510.full.pdf</a></p>

<p>And I admit, I like this link. But there is only a TINY snippet on coconut oil. And all of that is in regards to cholesterol. So the negative results of coconut oil is going to effect rich Americans, and Europeans (<a href="http://imgur.com/a/ZCRjF">http://imgur.com/a/ZCRjF</a>) more than anyone else. And that is probably because they were eating bad in the first place. Coconut oil can be a preventative. But it is not a medicine to cure your cholesterol. It appears briefly on page 13 (of 25.)</p>

<p>So let&#39;s dissect that a little closer.</p>

<p>Here is my reply to this. I will only state important parts (leaving out things like surveys of opinions, ect.)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The fatty acid profile of coconut oil is 82% saturated, about half lauric acid, and the rest myristic, palmitic, stearic, and short-chain fatty acids (Table).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is nothing wrong with this. Lauric acids are medium chain fatty acids. This is perfectly healthy. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Lauric acid replacing carbohydrates increases LDL cholesterol but by about half as much as myristic and palmitic acids</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No one is recommending using coconut oil, and cutting carbs. You need carbs. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>the informative comparison is between coconut oil and vegetable oils high in monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Coconut oil can not be high in polyunasturated fats as it is not a nut. seed. or fish. The comparisons are hogwash.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This leaves out the very important part of who the test was on. And when it was conducted. This was a test from 12 years ago, and it was with people with elevated cholesterol levels. It shows source [95] but it is up to the reader to actually look into that. Here is the link to the actual study. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7595099">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7595099</a></p>

<p>Another carefully controlled experiment found that coconut oil significantly increased LDL cholesterol compared with olive oil.96</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, this was an odd test that only involved Malaysians, that ate a traditional Malaysian diet. And they were testing coconut oil separately from the other 2, with full understanding that Diets high in palmitic acid, lauric and myristic acids, and  lauric and myristic acids are completely different.</p>

<p>BUT they found that all 3 were HEALTHY! </p>

<p>Here is a link to the actual study. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22030224">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22030224</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>A recent systematic review found 7 controlled trials, including the 2 just mentioned, that compared coconut oil with monounsaturated or polyunsaturated oils.97 Coconut oil raised LDL cholesterol in all 7 of these trials, significantly in 6 of them. The authors also noted that the 7 trials did not find a difference in raising LDL cholesterol between coconut oil and other oils high in saturated fat such as butter, beef fat, or palm oil.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They sum it up with &quot;we advise against the use of coconut oil.&quot;</p>

<p>Well one of the 2 studies they mentions, says that coconut oil is healthy in the title! </p>

<p>Here is the study they quote: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26946252">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26946252</a>.</p>

<p>I have a problem with the researchers, but I will leave that out for this. They are only talking about Cholesterol. And all they say is that certain plant oils are better for Cholesterol than coconut oil, but coconut oil is still better than butter, beef fat, and palm oil.</p>

<hr/>

<p>I have no paid interest here. But I am inclined as a father to research these things because my daughters life is affected by it. Don&#39;t buy this guys BS. He is just trying to promote his &quot;New Diet Plan&quot;. And that in itself is BS. It is just promoting US oil, and agriculture companies.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Edit: Ok I posted this in another sub (That I am not allowed to mention here) and I had a user &quot;call me out&quot; so to say. I thought I would copy my reply to him here, as it is always good to see some controversial points as well.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You declare it “fake news” and a disinfo campaign but don’t really substantiate that. The latter is a very big claim. Who is behind the disinfo, who is it aimed at, and why?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&quot;Frank Sacks, lead author on the report, said he has no idea why people think coconut oil is healthy. It&#39;s almost 100% fat.&quot; The lead author is behind it. He is trying to tell people that because coconut oil if fat, it is unhealthy. Yet he recommends other oils that are also fat. But can be worse once cooked due to becoming carcinogenic. That is the only reference to mis-info I used. &quot;Who is behind it&quot; Rank Sacks. and <em>possibly</em> others. I will mention that shortly. &quot;Who is it aimed at?&quot; Most likely IMHO the people he is selling his &quot;Diet&quot; too, and people that are on the fence about using coconut oil. &quot;Why&quot; I have no idea. This other is odd, in that he has no wiki, which for a person of his status, should. And that he has done previous reports that are contractual to this new one. </p>

<p>&quot;Who is behind it&quot; part 2, other than Sacks. I can not be certain, but he does advertise The Standard American Diet (SAD) which is one of the primary fuels of not only big agriculture, but big pharma. If we all ate a healthy diet, the medical mafia would be dead and gone within a few short years.</p>

<p>It&#39;s worth noting (again) that Dr Sacks has numerous Journal publications on mortality studies on long chain fatty acids. Seems somewhat controversial to this article.</p>

<p>Link: <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;q=dr+frank+sacks&amp;btnG=&amp;as_sdt=1%2C15&amp;as_sdtp=">https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;q=dr+frank+sacks&amp;btnG=&amp;as_sdt=1%2C15&amp;as_sdtp=</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Does this relate to your claims and accusations about who funded the study that you don’t look into or substantiate either? It’s a presidential advisory put together by the AHA and all the authors are listed. You can put together some proof of bias and anti-coconut oil, US oil, and agricultural funding and get back to us.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So we know it was funded by the AHA. And the lead author wwas Frank Sacks.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s look into AHA&#39;s funding. AHA is a 501(c) non-profit. In the last fiscal year they had $863,355,000 in total revenue. Approximately 20.8% was from Corporate sponsors. (~$180 million) [Source}(<a href="http://www.heart.org/idc/groups/heart-public/@wcm/@fin/documents/downloadable/ucm_491971.pdf">http://www.heart.org/idc/groups/heart-public/@wcm/@fin/documents/downloadable/ucm_491971.pdf</a>) 2-page pdf.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t believe I am doing this right now, but if you look the AHA&#39;s most recent tax documents <a href="http://www.heart.org/idc/groups/heart-public/@wcm/@fin/documents/downloadable/ucm_491516.pdf">SOURCE</a> 148 page PDF. Under Part II-B In their schedule C 990. You will see their purpose, and it is an congressional lobbying group. I am sure you know about lobbying groups. They are heavily funded by special interest groups. They obviously are doing other good things as well. But as their purpose in healthy hearts is great, I am more interested in the practice. You can see the board members, and highest paid employees names, but they are hard to find online.</p>

<p>On schedule F, part 1 you see their investments. And in the region of coconut oil producers, their investments Trump all others except for Europe. 41 million, vs. the next closest, 18 mil. for N. America. Which also trumps the next closest, 2.5 mil for all of south america.</p>

<p>So maybe they are investing in coconut oil, while hurting the market, so that they can get a larger profit gain. Glad I looked into that.</p>

<p>Schedule 1 part 2 shows donations, and I found an odd one. 173,000 to a 501c georgia bikes, who also receives donations from Americans largest oil veggie oil producer. Just found that interesting.</p>

<p>But here is what I was looking for: $1.45 million to Frank Sacks employer. EIN-04-2103580 for &quot;Reasearch&quot;</p>

<p>Schedule M, part 1 shows non cash donations. </p>

<p>Some oddities, 436 automobiles, 289 shares of stocks valued ~4 million., 2,172 collectables, 1 add council add valued at 58.6 million, 2,003 paid travels, 5,867 instances of donated &quot;recreation&quot;.</p>

<p>They also state that they intend to sell the donated cars. I figured as much.</p>

<p>OK. I read the whole tax return. There is no note of who the donors are, but what we have is a congressional lobbying group, that receives many odd donations, that <em>could</em> be used to persuade politicians to vote favorably.</p>

<p>Also, the amount of investments in coconut producing areas of the world may be a cause for this dis-info campaign. They could be trying to buy up stock, and than later recant their studies with new ones.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Earth. 2781 AD.</p>

<p>The alien presence has finally blocked the scant sunlight we were getting in Georgia. The milky oil continues to flood parts of the globe, daily. Some people have successfully climbed the interior &quot;walls&quot; of the anomaly, and report that the flesh on the wall is &quot;kind of tasty.&quot;</p>

<p>The remaining satellites we can still communicate with have given us the following mysterious image: {Couldn&#39;t even find a coconut in space image for this... &gt;:-(  }</p>

<p>Planet Gorglax: 380A4</p>

<p>Operation &quot;Get Emperor Zorglax a giant piña colada&quot; is progressing nicely. The newly acquired coconut planet (Filled with hairless solids) is approaching completion. The Pineapple Syndicate has proven once again, that they are reliable allies, by providing us with, not only an entire solar system full of pineapples, but also over 1000 comets of pure ice.</p>

<p>It is my sad duty to report that the planet Rumbarrel IV has had a global catastrophe. This is a repeat of Rumbarrel III by all accounts.</p>

<p>It would be prudent to find a species that can survive the fermentation process without &quot;producing poor product.&quot;</p>

<p>End of report. Hail Zorglax!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s definitely incorrect to say all oils are bad for you. We need oils/fats. Just in the right proportions and the right kinds to be bioavailable for the proper functioning of the body. Every single cell in our bodies is composed of a layer of lipids. If a person had zero fat intake (which is next to impossible except under some totalitarian experiment) that person would get sick in a few months and die a painful death. We must have fat to replenish natural metabolic processes.</p>

<p>The key is in the amount and the kinds.</p>

<p>Are you sure about that? All the legumes I looked at have a negligible amount of fat. Most of their calories come from fiber, starches, other carbs, and proteins.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I started using it years ago and it has made a big difference in my quality of life. I have psoriasis, and coconut oil reduces my inflammation by (personal estimation) 80%. I use it all over my body, am almost 30 years old - have not had a single stretch mark, cellulite dimple, scar, wrinkle... not a single one. My skin looks remarkable. My teeth are healthier. I had recessed gums from using whitening treatment after braces. The oil stops pain, bleeding, and eventually promotes healing. It is also a wonderful cooking tool and healthy to eat. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Love this, thanks for sharing. I agree with you on all counts. It is disgusting both how the gov and MSM propagate this disinfo and how the public blindly believes it. I had seen this article here first; within a day I saw sheeple on my Facebook feed sharing it (one is a lawyer) agreeing with USA Today.</p>

<p>Just one question, if I may - can you expand more on this part:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And yet, they never discuss Carnitine palmitoyltransferase II which is the main enzyme that breaks down the long-chain fats. Also if you simply do some research you will find that &quot;Traditional coconut oil&quot; contains 62-65% MCTs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What is the relevancy of the enzymatic breakdown to this particular study and how are the effects linked positively and/or negatively? Thanks again.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I take a spoonful of coconut oil and organic butter blended in a coffee most mornings and I feel that it has greatly improved my health. Over a number of years I have attempted to withdraw from my (unnecessary, I believe) antidepressant tablets and the physical withdrawal symptoms have been increasingly horrendous: dizziness, nausea, shaking, and a burning, throbbing pain in my legs.</p>

<p>This time I almost free of my medication and I believe that it is great part thanks to the coconut oil/butter concoction that I take most mornings: about 20 minutes after drinking the coffee I feel the pain ebb away, which lasts for about 3-4 hours before it returns. </p>

<p>That aside, I also feel an improved mental clarity on those days when I take my coconut oil/butter coffee: I can concentrate for longer and I just generally feel sharper. There has also been a general lifting of the brain fog as I gradually reduce the dose of my antidepressant, but the difference between those days when I take coconut oil/butter and those when I don&#39;t is noticeable. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve tinkered with my diet over the years and the elimination of safflower, corn, sunflower, soybean and cottonseed oils from my diet is probably the single most health-promoting change I&#39;ve made. I use coconut oil, EVOO (not from Europe though as the Italian mob apparently runs the <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2011/apr/14/news/la-olive-oil-20110414">EVOO-racket</a> and cuts the product with the cheaper oils I&#39;m trying to avoid), grass-fed butter, and lard I render at home from foraged hogs and then freeze.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. I noticed huge changes in my health from changing my diet.</p>

<p>I do not use coconut oil often, I only use it is dishes that are appropriate for the taste. But cutting the GMO oils has brought benefits.</p>

<p>But even more than that (and this may sound hard to many, but it was very easy) When I cut cheese from my diet I noticed the most change. This may have been because I ate a ton of cheese before though.</p>

<p>I eliminated dairy from my diet for a decade and I just couldn&#39;t get past the lack of cheese! I mean, I felt better, not ingesting conventional pasteurized, homogenized dairy, but there&#39;s just no such thing as vegan cheese - the analogs are all disgusting. </p>

<p>The other thing I missed was real honest-to-Christ cream in my coffee. Tried a number of other whiteners and none of them really did the trick.</p>

<p>So, I found a farmer who sells raw grass-fed milk and cheeses (and yogurt! and kefir!) straight from his farm and have been a loyal customer ever since. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hmm, interesting. I&#39;ve always seen the latest &quot;Superfoods&quot; being conflicted. Some MSM will write a story about how great it is. And then tabloids will buzz about it. Then it becomes popular and starts showing up in health markets. Then start showing up in mainstream markets. Then suddenly they &quot;Aren&#39;t as healthy as we suspected&quot; and I think it&#39;s a way to cycle through small batch crop to create a bubble market and possibly have small farms/manufacturers invest into something that soon collapses and leaves smaller businesses desperate and leaving them in a situation where being bought out doesn&#39;t seem like a terrible idea.

The amount of makeup, hair spray, and glitter on females today, is a hundred times greater than it was in the 60s and 70s. Women seem to be in some kind of trance with a need for chemicals all over them, that are filled with poison. Hardly any old ladies dyed their gray hair in the 60s, 70s. Almost none. Now? Almost every 80 year old woman had dyed hair, out of their tranced fear shame paradigm of vanity hypnosis.<br/>
But coconut oil is so bad everyone. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Botanically speaking, a coconut is a fibrous one-seeded drupe, also known as a dry drupe. However, when using loose definitions, the coconut can be all three: a fruit, a nut, and a seed. Botanists love classification.</p>

<p>Coconut oil is most definitely an MCT majority. And not LCT. </p>

<p>As for Omega 3&#39;s. I have nothing against them, and agree that they are healthy. I personally include them in <em>my</em> diet. But I am strict on where I get them from. (i.e. not from GMO oils.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. I noticed huge changes in my health from changing my diet.</p>

<p>I do not use coconut oil often, I only use it is dishes that are appropriate for the taste. But cutting the GMO oils has brought benefits.</p>

<p>But even more than that (and this may sound hard to many, but it was very easy) When I cut cheese from my diet I noticed the most change. This may have been because I ate a ton of cheese before though.</p>

<p>People talk about how fluoride effects your pineal glan, but I think it is the GMO oils that are doing it. (if anything really is)</p>

Cosmo has some serious fucking gall pointing fingers at anyone regarding public health issues.<br/>
Self reported respiratory symptoms and diseases among hairdressers.<br/>

They have made billions over the decades, literally selling women poison.<br/>
Now they say coconut oil is bad. LOL<br/>
The fetish for glitter is also a topic that Cosmo makes tons of dough off of.<br/>

The amount of makeup, hair spray, and glitter on females today, is a hundred times greater than it was in the 60s and 70s. Women seem to be in some kind of trance with a need for chemicals all over them, that are filled with poison. Hardly any old ladies dyed their gray hair in the 60s, 70s. Almost none. Now? Almost every 80 year old woman had dyed hair, out of their tranced fear shame paradigm of vanity hypnosis.<br/>
But coconut oil is so bad everyone. </p>
