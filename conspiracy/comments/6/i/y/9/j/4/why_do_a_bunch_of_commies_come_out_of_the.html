<p>So do you want less State? </p>

<p>Lower the taxes</p>

<p>Sell all State-owned companies. </p>

<p>Reduce the number of Public Agents. </p>

<p>Reduce the need for welfare by promoting free market (strong economy = more people employed = less people on welfare)</p>

<p>Reduce the State regulation on all spheres</p>

<p>That&#39;s how you get less State.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>“The proletariat seizes from state power and turns the means of production into state property to begin with. But thereby it abolishes itself as the proletariat, abolishes all class distinctions and class antagonisms, and abolishes also the state as state. Society thus far, operating amid class antagonisms, needed the state, that is, an organization of the particular exploiting class, for the maintenance of its external conditions of production, and, therefore, especially, for the purpose of forcibly keeping the exploited class in the conditions of oppression determined by the given mode of production (slavery, serfdom or bondage, wage-labor). The state was the official representative of society as a whole, its concentration in a visible corporation. But it was this only insofar as it was the state of that class which itself represented, for its own time, society as a whole: in ancient times, the state of slave-owning citizens; in the Middle Ages, of the feudal nobility; in our own time, of the bourgeoisie. When at last it becomes the real representative of the whole of society, it renders itself unnecessary. As soon as there is no longer any social class to be held in subjection, as soon as class rule, and the individual struggle for existence based upon the present anarchy in production, with the collisions and excesses arising from this struggle, are removed, nothing more remains to be held in subjection — nothing necessitating a special coercive force, a state. The first act by which the state really comes forward as the representative of the whole of society — the taking possession of the means of production in the name of society — is also its last independent act as a state. State interference in social relations becomes, in one domain after another, superfluous, and then dies down of itself. The government of persons is replaced by the administration of things, and by the conduct of processes of production. The state is not &#39;abolished&#39;. It withers away. This gives the measure of the value of the phrase &#39;a free people&#39;s state&#39;, both as to its justifiable use for a long time from an agitational point of view, and as to its ultimate scientific insufficiency; and also of the so-called anarchists&#39; demand that the state be abolished overnight.&quot; <a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1877/anti-duhring/index.htm">(Herr Eugen Duhring&#39;s Revolution in Science [Anti-Duhring], pp.301-03, third German edition.)</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>so why the winners/losers/victim approach to identity politics?  </p>

<p>Everyone is simply self advocating.  That means that some exclusionary language and behaviors need to change in order to accommodate.  Don&#39;t be slinging the fag word around if your establishment actually tries to hire fairly.  </p>

<p>Don&#39;t be all he&#39;s a tard, she&#39;s a tard if you work with people who have mentally handicapped in their family.  </p>

<p>And if you don&#39;t know about the people around you, your sense of decorum should stipulate that you don&#39;t assume to know whether or not they are part of a minority group or intimately linked to a minority group. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, we all get this bullshit pussification of america speech every twenty years.  Almost always conservative white dudes, and their bitching.  Bitching about being courteous to people they don&#39;t know.  And they make millions of dollars stroking that nasty little hatewolf that runs wild in society, usually amongst the insecure and gullible.  Send me 10$ and god will forgive you for all the bad shit you did this week gullible.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Commie here, coming out of the woodwork to share a Marxist perspective on identity politics.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2016/08/30/pers-a30.html">The socioeconomic basis of identity politics: Inequality and the rise of an African American elite</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Democratic Party, supported by all of the various left-liberal and pseudo-left trends, is particularly aggressive and vociferous on this score. Identity politics, the self-centered, upper-middle-class obsession with race, gender and sexual identity, has become one of that party’s principal pillars.</p>

<p>As opposed to earlier periods, today the question of race is not associated with civil rights, with a major program of social reform, with improvements in the social conditions of the working class as a whole and certainly not with socialism. The debate on race is largely built around demands for the allocation of greater economic resources to sections of the black petty bourgeoisie. There is a marked and noticeable absence of democratic demands and sentiments within the leadership of these upper-middle-class movements.</p>

<p>The character of the present campaigns, including the narrow and vicious tone of much of the rhetoric about race, can be explained if one examines a singular fact: the sharp growth of social inequality within the African American population.</p>

<p>The data suggests that while African Americans still play a very limited role at the heights of the corporate hierarchy, there is a highly significant and influential section that has benefited enormously over the past several decades. These people live in another universe and are deeply estranged from the broad layers of the black working-class population, which has suffered continual impoverishment.</p>

<p>From the administration of Richard Nixon onward, US ruling-class policy has been to cultivate a black upper-middle class that would be loyal to the status quo. In return, this layer abandoned any connection to mass struggle, social protest and opposition to capitalism. This helps explain why there is no leading African American figure, in any field, who today speaks for and to the broad masses of the people.</p>
