        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Made a post on Reddit earlier and got a reply from a reddit user: &quot;FBI-Anon&quot;. Is it the popular 4chan anon ive been following? My post went like this: </p>

<p>&quot;Prior to recent events I didnt have much of an opinion on most conpiracy theories. Recently my interests have shifted onto Cicada 3301&#39;s new 2017 puzzle reguarding the number 7 and its close proximity to events leading up to /vault7/. Soon after, i went down the rabbit hole leading to the interviews left by Ronald Bernard (a foriegn banking elite) in efforts to whistle blow the economic situation of the world. Linking recent conflicts, deals, scandels, diss appearances, political elections, human trafficking cases (for blackmailing elites), possible mind manipulation, leaks, and generalized internet posts (like FBIanon on 4chan), Im pointed in the direction that leads me to believe Cicada is trying to create a forum to provide privacy and safety to those trying to take down either government overthrow, corruption or elite abuse.</p>

<p>This being said, while it&#39;s been a freaky ride, I love playing the game. Im still a baby though when it comes to knowing whats behind conspiracies and I really want to press further on all of this. So I can get a bigger picture, can you guys either confirm or elaborate on my findings, as well as provide me with leads on some of your favorite conspiracy theories to follow? Any info appreciated, thanks&quot;</p>

<p>In reply to this a user who goes by the screename &quot;FBI-Anon&quot; commented: &quot;You are close, but you are looking too hard&quot; then left a fibanocci sequence (not sure if a key/clue of some sort or his signature)</p>

<p>He stopped replying after this so i couldnt confirm any more information on the subject but What do you think he/she meant by this? And is this the famous 4chan fbianon we all know and love or just another &quot;Larper&quot;?</p>

<p>EDIT: Here&#39;s a link to the original post (its a lil embarrassing cause i think i lost my cool but maybe im just being paranoid. Anyways...):</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I may be wrong but it looks to me like trying to point out that the 7th number of the fib seq is 8 and that 8 is significant. Also the number 21 though I&#39;m unsure why there. Maybe because 21 is also 777? I think we will find out near the end of summer what it&#39;s all about.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you reckon he&#39;s referring to the fib sequence as my focus? That almost means nothing to me, ive been keeping up with the puzzles as part of the vault 7 leaks put in terms of numbers and actual cryptography im unfortunately in the dark. Im just a humble fan of the mysterious happenings going on lately. Do you think he means to refer this back to the puzzles or something mentioned prior?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No worries i just wish i knew what the numbers meant. And if im making any progress to understand all this new mysterious information. Kinda desperate and what FBI-Anon has said in the past does line up with many of my theories. Me going off on my theory on vault7&#39;s leaks being linked to the newest cicada puzzle is driving me nuts. Especially when a user &quot;FBI-anon&quot; is involved. I have no where to look. You think i need some sort of cryptography skill to understand what he&#39;s trying to tell me? Because with him implying i put focus on the number 8 and 21, i have no idea what that could mean. My best idea is maybe to get ready for an 8th event leading to something happening after a 21st event. Its so broad though its driving me mad</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I haven&#39;t really focused on it that much honestly. There are certainly crazy things happening. If you&#39;ve never studied the book of Revelation I&#39;d suggest giving it a read. If you pay attention we&#39;re seeing the events in it unfold before our eyes. Syria, the Euphrates, the sign from Rev 12:1-2 are already clearly visible. It&#39;s complex and unfortunately I don&#39;t have all the answers but it looks like we may see Jesus return soon, whether that&#39;s a few months or a few years idk. Regardless, these are exciting times. Jesus said that in the last days there would be wars and rumors of war. I think no one can deny we&#39;re seeing that. Here&#39;s the text I&#39;m referring to from Matthew 24, it&#39;s from 1599 and written in old English:</p>

<p>Matthew 24:4-31
[4]And Iesus answered, and sayd vnto them, Take heede that no man deceiue you.
[5]For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ, and shall deceiue many.
[6]And ye shall heare of warres, and rumours of warres: see that ye be not troubled: for all these things must come to passe, but the end is not yet.
[7]For nation shall rise against nation, and realme against realme, and there shalbe famine, and pestilence, and earthquakes in diuers places.
[8]All these are but ye beginning of sorowes.
[9]Then shall they deliuer you vp to be afflicted, and shall kill you, and ye shall be hated of all nations for my Names sake.
[10]And then shall many be offended, and shall betray one another, and shall hate one another.
[11]And many false prophets shall arise, and shall deceiue many.
[12]And because iniquitie shalbe increased, the loue of many shalbe colde.
[13]But he that endureth to the ende, he shalbe saued.
[14]And this Gospel of the kingdome shalbe preached through the whole world for a witnes vnto all nations, and then shall the end come.
[15]When ye therefore shall see the abomination of desolation spoken of by Daniel the Prophet, set in the holy place (let him that readeth consider it.)
[16]Then let them which be in Iudea, flee into the mountaines.
[17]Let him which is on the house top, not come downe to fetch any thing out of his house.
[18]And he that is in the fielde, let not him returne backe to fetch his clothes.
[19]And woe shalbe to them that are with childe, and to them that giue sucke in those dayes.
[20]But pray that your flight be not in the winter, neither on the Sabbath day.
[21]For then shall be great tribulation, such as was not from the beginning of the worlde to this time, nor shalbe.
[22]And except those dayes should be shortened, there should no flesh be saued: but for the elects sake those dayes shalbe shortened.
[23]Then if any shall say vnto you, Loe, here is Christ, or there, beleeue it not.
[24]For there shall arise false Christes, and false prophets, and shall shewe great signes and wonders, so that if it were possible, they should deceiue the very elect.
[25]Beholde, I haue tolde you before.
[26]Wherefore if they shall say vnto you, Beholde, he is in the desert, goe not forth: Beholde, he is in the secret places, beleeue it not.
[27]For as the lightning commeth out of the East, and is seene into the West, so shall also the comming of the Sonne of man be.
[28]For wheresoeuer a dead carkeis is, thither will the Egles be gathered together.
[29]And immediatly after ye tribulations of those dayes, shall the sunne be darkened, and the moone shall not giue her light, and the starres shall fal from heauen, and ye powers of heaue shalbe shake.
[30]And then shall appeare the signe of the Sonne of man in heauen: and then shall all the kinreds of the earth mourne, and they shall see the Sonne of man come in the cloudes of heauen with power and great glorie.
[31]And he shall send his Angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather together his elect, from the foure windes, and from the one ende of the heauens vnto the other.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Events on an apocalyptic scale are closer than originally thought, you suggest? Id say id have to agree but playing devils advocate here, there is evidence that the sort of conflict already happened years ago. I think im going to look into the political system for that kind of evidence and hope i dont have to rely on prophecy to find that out...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure some of them have happened before, and if the heavens and earth we know survive our stupidity they&#39;re likely to again. I personally believe they&#39;re close but this is something I&#39;d love to be wrong about. I don&#39;t want people to be condemned, even the people I&#39;m not overly fond of. Politics is certainly easier to understand than prophecy and I&#39;ve been tracking both as best I&#39;m able. I don&#39;t like secrets and it certainly seems like most prophecy is occulted. I&#39;m prepared for pretty much anything and I&#39;m hopeful the fact that I know I&#39;m ignorant will help me regardless. I figure if I know I&#39;m a fool at least I&#39;m willing to learn lol. I&#39;ll friend you on here and hopefully between the two of us we&#39;ll get truth. I don&#39;t have the right mind to follow the cicada stuff. I know the math to a certain extent but I get lost when  it switches to using the wave forms of audio to make pictures etc and can only see it after it&#39;s pointed out to me.</p>

Plus all that stuff about encryption of files isnt my forte either perhaps we&#39;ll meet someone of the right mind.

    <div class="md"><p>~~those who place the puzzles know where to start the trace and data stream, the harder puzzles rank the potential.  all who attempt are d-based, like a digital al-qaeda.   </p>

<p>also consider the real life landmark clues give excellent potential for tracking the real-time person.  whether digitally or from real life surveillance they can profile the mark to see where and how to inject them into their monolith with its many branches, in essence match them up to a suitable role based upon the psyche and capability profile whether or not they&#39;d achieved the &quot;end goal.&quot;</p>

<p>back in the day, early 90&#39;s &quot;security experts&quot; would induce &quot;kids&quot; via chat rooms and icq to break into decoy servers of alleged banks and high-interest targets, arrest them, offer them immunity in exchange for &quot;cooperation,&quot; as well stroke the chit out of their egos, make them sign a non-disclose and put them to work, all the whle continuing the ego stroke until they&#39;re let go.~~</p>

<p>I am not FBI Anon! None of them are fbi agents. It&#39;s a larp, it&#39;s people who are deep into politics and say the right words.</p>

<p>You know those psychic guys that do TV shows and speak to people&#39;s dead grandparents? Fbi anon is kinda like that, lots of bluff and bluster with no substance. Iirc correctly one of the FBI Anons said Hillary was deathly ill and would die before the end of 2016, just one example of something that seemed reasonable (hillary had a fainting incident mid election) but wasn&#39;t based on any kind of facts - it sounded good though! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry, the fibonacci thing was a misdirection to highlight the ease with which someone with good intentions can be misled, apologies. </p>

<p>I know little of cicada, if it&#39;s overtly political they might be trying to &quot;bring you to their side&quot;. But if it&#39;s just a puzzleci doubt there is much harm playing along. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh phew you gotta chill with the mysterious crap, really threw me off there for a sec looking for some higher meaning lol. But anyways when you said &quot;close but youre looking too hard&quot; what did that refer to? And to what do you focus on so i can get a lead? Also yeah but its political theme seems to highlight a support for privacy to create some sort of underground network to hide from elites.(my hypothesis). Also i read an article that suggests they were involved with providing some sort of key to chelsea manning to help encrypt data in hopes to leak info. So i do believe the messages of &quot;enlightenment&quot; have to do with being able to share a sense of truth through privacy. Short answer: i believe it is a puzzle that communicates the message for potential of finding a higher meaning within society, possibly society&#39;s corruption status is involved which is why i would like to persue it further. But politically i have found no correlation between actual &quot;politics&quot; in the sense of an angenda so i dont think its a scheme to &quot;get youto side with them&quot;. But of course im always weary when treading into unknown waters</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also heres Defango&#39;s take on the new puzzles confirming a chance of the cicada  wikepedia being potentially false, as well as the possibility that this new &quot;Z&quot; messager from the new puzzles isnt the original guy but known to have some correlation with the solvings of the original liber primus (if you wish to push further):

    <div class="md"><p>But yeah i have noticed a lot of his/her posts were broad. But i do fear events leadint to coup de tat adn i do fear events of war. Refering back to my last posts, im new to this conspiracy community but i would like to be more invested. I know i should do my homework but id like a few leads. Begining this journey, id like to have a lead or two and research myself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cicada 3301 is one of my favorites. Do you personally think that cicada and vault 7 are connected in a way. This year&#39;s puzzle has had a lot of foreshadowing relating to vault 7 in a way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I definitely gravitate to the theiry that their linked and more leaks are yet to come. But i also think the people behind the &quot;new&quot; cicada puzzles are either created by a new &quot;author&quot; or organization. The liber primus from like 2014 still needs to be solved so i think there hasnt been any more &quot;official&quot; puzzles. Given the artifacts found during the 2017 puzzle, the puzzles have shifted from a &quot;philosophical&quot; standpoint (with elements of philosophy still there ofc) to a more &quot;political&quot; route (if vault7 counts as political idk). Another cool thing to look into is bruno borges&#39; disappearance and his involvement with the new puzzles. But again, the new puzzles are probably not the original official cicada 3301 in my opinion but they definitely still have something important they want to tell solvers i believe</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He has been working on solving this year&#39;s puzzle and making YouTube videos updating his finds. He works with other people to solve the puzzles too, but he said he was recruited by Cicada3301 to be their &quot;voice&quot; to give out messages.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think those might be a few big claims considering the Bruno case and cicada choosing them as a &quot;voice&quot;. He seems like an interesting guy but still that&#39;s something to approach very carefully for sure</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No worries i just wish i knew what the numbers meant. And if im making any progress to understand all this new mysterious information. Kinda desperate and what FBI-Anon has said in the past does line up with many of my theories. Me going off on my theory on vault7&#39;s leaks being linked to the newest cicada puzzle is driving me nuts. Especially when a user &quot;FBI-anon&quot; is involved. I have no where to look. You think i need some sort of cryptography skill to understand what he&#39;s trying to tell me? Because with him implying i put focus on the number 8 and 21, i have no idea what that could mean. My best idea is maybe to get ready for an 8th event leading to something happening after a 21st event. Its so broad though its driving me mad</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure some of them have happened before, and if the heavens and earth we know survive our stupidity they&#39;re likely to again. I personally believe they&#39;re close but this is something I&#39;d love to be wrong about. I don&#39;t want people to be condemned, even the people I&#39;m not overly fond of. Politics is certainly easier to understand than prophecy and I&#39;ve been tracking both as best I&#39;m able. I don&#39;t like secrets and it certainly seems like most prophecy is occulted. I&#39;m prepared for pretty much anything and I&#39;m hopeful the fact that I know I&#39;m ignorant will help me regardless. I figure if I know I&#39;m a fool at least I&#39;m willing to learn lol. I&#39;ll friend you on here and hopefully between the two of us we&#39;ll get truth. I don&#39;t have the right mind to follow the cicada stuff. I know the math to a certain extent but I get lost when  it switches to using the wave forms of audio to make pictures etc and can only see it after it&#39;s pointed out to me.</p>
