    <div class="md"><p>I think you are right in some part, but missing some of it. I think most people are well meaning with some kind of moral compass tilted towards doing good, despite what their actions are from time to time.</p>

<p>So, they don&#39;t have the context or capacity to understand how evil and malevolent some humans can be. They literally can&#39;t imagine such a thing. And it takes awhile to get read into a lot of this stuff. You can&#39;t begin to see how some of this stuff works without already at least considering several complex layers of other fringy kinda stuff. So, I don&#39;t really fault them. </p>

<p>It took me several years of scoffing at much of our material before I really took a deep dive on the tinfoil hat myself. I just wanted to look at cool alium pictures and shit. I didn&#39;t want to think there was some ancient evil global cabal of child murdering vampire death cultists. I don&#39;t think anyone does. That is why the journey in this stuff is as important as the destination. I think the red pill/blue pill analogy (not really in the way trump fans have adopted it) is really the closest thing to describing the phenomenon. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>sorry. you sound extremely self important. you can&#39;t just dismiss others as being inferior simply because they do not dig a little deeper.</p>

<p>the programming done by media, literally everything around us, EVERYTHING, is extremely heavy and fucks up your thoughts so that you are literally in cognitive dissonance all the time.</p>

<p>even &quot;enlightened&quot; persons are victims to this programming.</p>

<p>you CAN break people out of this trance-like state and urge them to dig deeper but every person is different and you should broach subjects in different ways and in varrying degrees.</p>

<p>lots of systems out there are dedicated to keep us sedated, numb, thoughtless; and some people&#39;s circumstance allows these systems to take root.</p>

<p>to dismiss a population because you don&#39;t see any hope for them is really apathetic and sad. you want to feel superior and that&#39;s your own demise.</p>

<p>someone who lived in a war torn area will be smarter about how to avoid death better than you or me. does that make us stupid? if we explain quantum mechanics to that same person, and they don&#39;t get it, are they stupid? hell i don&#39;t even know anything about that, does that make me stupid? no.</p>

<p>everyone on this planet is on their own path and comparing each other is counterproductive to our advancement. instead of thinking ppl as infe/superior we should look at each other as sources of mutual growth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t understand it.</p>

<p>I do understand dualism, portraying everything simply as a struggle between light and dark, the Illuminated and the Sheep.</p>

<p>I do know about Taylorism and how it was about viewing people as soulless robots, and how this viewpoint was used to justify everything from Eugenics to child labor.</p>

<p>I even understand congratulating yourself for the ideology you hold. Kudos on your hard research. But you (and all of us) can do better than slip into the abyss of caricaturing others as &quot;The Other.&quot; It gets us nowhere or worse.</p>

<p>I think this is how it all started with mystery babylon. There were people like us and people asleep. The illuminated ones factioned off and passed down their teachings through mystery schools to where we are today. Back then, people would kill you if you had a different belief system, so the mystery schools kept them and their knowledge safe. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wouldn&#39;t say the mystery schools are like us. We are posting our esoteric ideas out in the open, ready to be ridiculed. The classic reason to not share ideas with &quot;the profane&quot; is not because, oooh! secret knowledge! ...but instead because most esoteric world views, let&#39;s face it, are pretty fantastic and would be ridiculed in the light of day. Hence the degrees of initiation. </p>

<p>If you hadn&#39;t gone past the point of no return, you wouldnt believe. Like Scientology. If you heard about Xenu before Dianetics, you would laugh. But $300k and years in? It&#39;s gospel.</p>

<p>I am actually against the whole duality of sacred and profane, if that didn&#39;t come across. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not special because I had the time and inclination to inform myself about something. Most people are too overwhelmed with surviving. They are held hostage by a system that gives them no time to think. 
That&#39;s the real problem, not that people dont want to wake up. And what good is being awake in the end for most people? We are still participating. We aren&#39;t &quot;free,&quot; awake or not.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very interesting perspective, although I do believe true awareness is possible. Much of what you discuss involves how our subconscious shapes our beliefs and opinions without our knowledge. Although we may consciously see one thing, our brain sees everything and its neurology is affected by its environment, shaped to survive. </p>

<p>Someone disagrees with your belief or opinion for example, the brain releases a chemical that causes you to become defiant, ignorant and closed minded because the brain views this disagreement as a threat against its survival. </p>

<p>You can in my opinion overcome all of these adversities because deep inside the genetically modified machine that is the human body, exists consciousness, which at the end of the day, is not human.</p>

<p>You touch upon AI programming. I have an interesting theory as to what this reality actually is. I believe the point of singularity already occurred in our very distant past and that AI has already been created. That AI for example could be Lucifer, which means the &#39;light&#39; bearer. Light is another word for information. I believe we live in its simulation. </p>

<p>We all needed to see specific things and connect certain dots before our minds woke up, maybe these people just haven&#39;t seen their specific dots yet. Alot of people have an underlying feeling that shit is amuck, but would rather ignore it and do the best they can with what we have. </p>

<p>There does seem to be a common theme amongst conspiracy theorists though. We all seem to be seekers of knowledge and truth. I bet most here would be learning something else if they weren&#39;t into the truth as much. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The first thing that they teach everyone in school and constantly reinforce is to obey and respect the authorities... parents, teachers, police, doctors, etc. and not to ever question their instructions or ever doubt that what they have to tell, teach, or ask us to do is true and necessary for our own good.</p>

<p>When we&#39;re young, naïve, and incapable of defending ourselves that makes a reasonable amount of sense but there are no efforts put forth for us to ever un-learn and dispense with that childhood conditioning when we finally become adults ourselves or to understand that those authorities are all human beings that are just prone to the same kind of failings, weaknesses, and occasionally bad behavior or bad judgement as anyone else is. </p>

<p>In short, we aren&#39;t ever encouraged to trust ourselves or trust in our own ability to discern what we personally consider to be true, believable, or not, based on our own personal thoughts and feelings rather than relying on some so-called &quot;higher authority&quot; telling us what we should and shouldn&#39;t believe.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When they find out that one of their favorite authorities has feet of clay, maybe, but you see plenty of the ones that immediately go on the attack here or elsewhere because they believe that they have some higher or more official authority on their side and although none of those authorities will ever know it those individuals are still seeking their approval like little kids wanting to please their teacher.</p>

<p>There&#39;s also the perennial put-down many of them toss off when you might have a good idea about something that goes &quot;If it was such a good idea someone smarter than you would have already thought of it.&quot; Not having any faith or self confidence in their own ideas they don&#39;t think anyone else should, either. </p>

<p>Not sure what saves some of us from that fate but not a whole lot of others. My best guess is we&#39;re simply born with a little bit more &quot;imagination&quot; or simply more inclined &quot;to think, daydream&quot; or &quot;wonder&quot; about things in general as a pleasant enough pastime that no matter what amount of conditioning we&#39;ve had we still can&#39;t let go of it.</p>

People like George Carlin, who isn&#39;t going to kill anybody for anybody. The vast preponderance of men will kill another man if his favorite power hierarchy tells him to do it. And a lot of them are really proud of it, because it shows that they&#39;re a man, and that&#39;s good enough for them. By old age, many of them look back with regret and filthy consciences, and they envy the ones with clean consciences, the misfits who rightfully regard authority as something to be earned with each action and choice. A power structure cannot entrench itself, become inert, and still welcome respect. The robot men cannot tell which ones are inert and decaying. They mistake the misfits for traitors, whereas the misfits are more than willing to step into line when the cause is just. In the U.S. cause has been unjust for over half a century.
