        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">76</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2017-06-21 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/LightBringerFlex.html">LightBringerFlex</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>16th Amendment:</p>

<p>The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes on incomes, from whatever source derived, without apportionment among the several States, and without regard to any census or enumeration.</p>

<p>Side note: Laws are always made unclear purposely so that the rulers can abuse them legally. </p>

<p>I&#39;m building up the story on income tax so if anyone has any useful links, please comment them in. </p>

<p>Basically, if I&#39;m not mistaken, what happened was that Woodrow Wilson, an Illuminati stooge, brought into existence the 16th amendment with the excuse that it would only be temporary until the war ended. The rich were to pay about 90% tax and the poorer people would pay less. </p>

<p>NOTE: Today, the rich people pay 0% tax and the poorer people pay up at least 30% when combining income and payroll taxes. The starving poor people can&#39;t afford to pay so they are thrown in prison where they become real life slaves making ten cents an hour. They flipped it around on us.</p>

<p>Also, the Illuminati of the time had decided to create tax free foundations for sinister reasons. The Clinton Foundation is a good example of one of those modern day foundations and these foundations are often used to fund fake civil right movements like Black Lives Matter tax free. Of course, they pocket a lot of the money too. </p>

<p>Federal Tax of 1884</p>

<p>In 1894, the Illuminati wanted to seize the wealth of Americans but they simply couldn&#39;t because it was clearly unconstitutional but they tried anyway. They were going to tax 2% on all income over $90,000 (in today&#39;s monetary value). </p>

<p>Pollock v. Farmers Loan Trust Co.</p>

<p>In 1885, the Supreme Court of the United States, in  Pollock v. Farmers Loan Trust Co., struck down the Federal Income tax of 1884 claiming it to be unconstitutional. </p>

<p>More info on this here:</p>

<p><a href="https://taxfoundation.org/today-history-income-tax-ruled-unconstitutional-pollock-v-farmers-loan-trust-co/">https://taxfoundation.org/today-history-income-tax-ruled-unconstitutional-pollock-v-farmers-loan-trust-co/</a></p>

<p>Somehow, someway, Wilson eventually ignored the Supreme Court ruling and brainwashed Americans into pay income tax anyway to support the war. Note that all wars are fake rackets designed to enrich weapons companies and their stooges so this income tax that was supposed to pay for the war was actually supposed to weaken the common man by removing money from the economy. </p>

<p>After a while, the Illuminati stooges in the US government were able to convince people to accept income tax as a permanent fixture in society and the 90% tax rate on the rich was eventually moved down to a 0% tax wage we see today. However, there is a huge strain on the middle class who has to pay 3 different taxes:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Payroll tax - This is typically about 30%.</p></li>
<li><p>Income tax - varies.</p></li>
<li><p>Sales Tax - 6-10% on all purchases. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>All of these taxes were made to sound like necessities to keep society running to hide the fact that this is really just like any mafia tax but the money is going to the worldwide Illuminati mafia. Not only does it make them richer but it weakens the Goy who they greatly fear and wish to enslave. </p>

<p>Of course the Federal Reserve was also thrown in the mix to further bankrupt the nation and the IRS is basically a private company of henchman that twist American citizens&#39; arms to milk them of every last dime they have. The ultimate goal is to exhaust every nations to the point where the citizens of the world beg the Illuminati for peace at which point the Illuminati will offer peace in exchange for a 1 world government controlled by the Illuminati. Therefore, the triple tax on Americans with the Federal Reserve tumor was created as an efficient machine to eventually bankrupt America.</p>

<p>Did You Know the IRS and the Fed are Private Corporations?:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.wakingtimes.com/2015/01/27/know-irs-fed-private-corporations/">http://www.wakingtimes.com/2015/01/27/know-irs-fed-private-corporations/</a></p>

<p>Wilson, an Illuminati stooge, illegally passed the 16th amendment even though the Supreme Court ruled it unconstitutional in 1885 with the hopes that America would swallow this painful pill without fighting back. For this reason, legally, the 16th amendment is null and void and the IRS is an illegal organization in cahoots with the Illuminati puppeteers. </p>

<p>Any lawyers reading this should start a class action lawsuit. </p>

<p>A speech from 50 years ago explains how income tax is unconstitutional and illegal perfectly:</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/6X_xB1JJ_Es?t=40m8s">https://youtu.be/6X_xB1JJ_Es?t=40m8s</a></p>

<p>Some might say that these taxes are used to build roads and pay for public services which may be partially true but most of it is used to enslave humanity. Basically, we pay people to enslave us. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the Council of Foreign Relations is the American branch of the Illuminati beast which has similar organizations in most every country. They consist mostly of Zionists and English monarchs. They also operate through Masonic lodges they planted worldwide. The Rothschild family may or may not be the head of the Illuminati but they are the highest members I can think of. The members seem to be connected to an old, diabolical country called Khazaria that worshiped some kind of Satanic being but later claimed to be Jewish to hide the truth of their sick religion. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>OP is way over his head here, and the sources are really bad. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Laws are always made unclear purposely so that the rulers can abuse them legally.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The prior rule was that &quot;indirect&quot; taxes had to be apportioned. The 16th Amendment does basically one thing: it says apportionment is no longer required. That&#39;s why income tax is covered under it -- because income tax is not normally apportioned. The change was to make the <em>income tax</em> legal.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Woodrow Wilson, an Illuminati stooge, brought into existence the 16th amendment</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The 16th Amendment was passed by congress in 1909. Wilson became president in 1913. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Somehow, someway, Wilson eventually ignored the Supreme Court ruling</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A Constitutional amendment overrides the Supreme Court. All Wilson did was certify the ratification <em>by the states</em>. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Payroll tax - This is typically about 30%.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>SSA is 6.2 percent, Medicare is 1.45 percent, totalling 7.65 percent. Add employers&#39; share and it becomes 15.3 percent.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>this is really just like any mafia tax but the money is going to the worldwide Illuminati mafia. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Look at the federal budget. More than all of the tax money is accounted for.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Of course the Federal Reserve was also thrown in the mix to further bankrupt the nation</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Federal Reserve System is inherently corrupt, but not for the reasons you claim.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>IRS is basically a private company</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No. LOL</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t <em>believe</em> anything. I see that there are debt payments going to the oligarchs, huge contracts going to the military contracting oligarchs, retirement and disability money going to disabled people and seniors, and medical money going to various places, and a little sliver left over for everything else. It makes pretty good sense to me. :)</p>

<p>It all fits together pretty well -- except of course all the money the Defense Department disappeared -- which has been well covered in Conspiracy and which would <em>reduce</em> the money available and cut exactly the wrong way to support your hypothesis that: </p>

<p>the money is going to the worldwide Illuminati mafia.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We need a free commercial system where we broadcast projects that need funding, how much we have saved, and how much is needed. We also need a website that does the same. This way, the people are completely informed on what&#39;s happening with their money. For example, we might need a bridge to replace a broken one and need $100,000. We post an ad on our TV channel to the whole nation and we will easily be able to fun $100,000. The fund raiser will run every day until it is capped and the people will fully understand that without this money, there won&#39;t a bridge which will make life a lot harder on the locals. </p>

<p>Also, if you are worried about people not helping, take a look at sites like GoFundMe.com where people from all over the country are paying to make other people&#39;s dreams come true. </p>

<p>No I&#39;m not totally okay with the tax system but I also don&#39;t think the idea of an income tax needs to be discredited. And I certainly don&#39;t care enough to write a treatise on it. Also, I never claimed to be an expert. I just used logic and 8 seconds of googling to confirm I was right.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They passed the amendment in order to amend the constitution so that it is legal to collect taxes. It wasn&#39;t legal in the case you cited, so they legally changed the wording of the constitution to override the supreme courts decision. Your methodology is incorrect here. This is like if we were all playing monopoly, and I wanted to build 10 hotels on my property while the rule book says I can only build 5. You (rightly so) complained when I tried to build a 6th hotel. So 3/4 of the people playing decided let&#39;s change the rules in order to allow for 10 hotels. We rewrite the rule book, everybody agrees to it, now I&#39;m allowed to put 10 hotels on boardway (fuck everybody else).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Come on man lol, you can get a fairly accurate and well sourced breakdown of the passage even on Wikipedia for something like this. A constitutional amendment is very very difficult to pass, it&#39;s something that&#39;s a little difficult to fake and push through by some cabal at the top, especially when the government was initially only looking to tax businesses at 2% (most of these rich cabal members got there with their businesses). So they would be pushing through an amendment and getting 3/4 of the state legislatures in the country to force through legislation? It&#39;s hard to pack the state legislatures in 3/4 of the country, I don&#39;t care how much power you have. </p>

<p>Right wingers.  They&#39;ve been steadily transferring the tax burden to the middle class and low income earners for decades but it really took off when neoliberalism became hegemonic during Reagan&#39;s tenure.</p>
