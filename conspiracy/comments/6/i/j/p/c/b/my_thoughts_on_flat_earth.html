    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s plenty to get skeptical about. And a lot of shit winds up being true.</p>

<p>FE isn&#39;t one of them though. It&#39;s scientific so we can prove it, unlike everything else being humans being assholes who can lie and mislead and kill people. Honestly man, I wouldn&#39;t waste your time. It&#39;s a good idea though if it made you question things, for me it was the Iraq war in the 2000s. Just remember some stuff does turn out wrong, especially when science has been doing its thing for tens of thousands of years, because we&#39;re lied to and mislead because once again: humans are shit.</p>

<p>i didnt clarify in my post, i tried to at end but, flat earth isnt what i&#39;m convinced of, i&#39;m convinced we are the center of the universe and that what we call space is not real, galaxies, nebulaus, blablahs, i need nasa to take a cellphone to the iss and take a picture from earth through the window</p>

<p>cuz everything looks fake, globe or not, i think our idea if a never ending cosmos is wrong.</p>

<p>science can math the heck outta whatever they want, in the end its just numbers and letters, that were perhaps created just for the fact its so easy to put the puzzle pieces together</p>

<p>How do you explain Mars orbit on a geocentric Earth? This was why Copernicus gave us our first solid understandings of a heliocentric solar system. </p>

<p>Mars makes loops in the sky which make zero sense if we are at the center. That means either Mars is special and can do cartwheels as it moves through the sky or that we orbit the sun. </p>

<p>Which scenario makes more sense to you?</p>

<p>It may feel that way, but look closer and you&#39;ll see it&#39;s not so simple. Or rather, much, much, simpler than you imagine.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not like all of these mathematical formulas that describe the universe are independently created out of nothing. They all build from an incredibly simple set of rules.</p>

<p>In another post you say that 1+1=2 is that because we say it is. That&#39;s not exactly true. There are a small handful of fundamental rules of arithmetic that we assume to be true but can&#39;t prove. The most widely accepted set are known as Peano&#39;s Axoims and consist of 5 rules. From these rules, we can actually prove that 1+1 must always equal 2.</p>

<p>From these same 5 rules we can prove every single thing known about all of arithmetic.</p>

<p>The same holds true for geometry and calculus. They arise from a very small number of assumptions (axioms) that we&#39;re really sure about, but can&#39;t prove.</p>

<p>Now, here&#39;s the thing - using these very small handful of simple rules, we can step by step - entirely traceable with nothing invented or tossed in - create equations that <em>perfectly</em> describe the motion of everything we&#39;ve seen move from entire galaxies down to electrons in an atom.</p>

<p>From these equations, we&#39;ve been able to predict thousands of facts about the universe <em>before</em> we ever had proof they existed. The atomic bomb, silicon computer chips, travel to the moon, entire elements - the equations told us &quot;hey, mathematically this thing should exist&quot; or &quot;this thing should be possible&quot; and after our technology progressed, sure enough there it was.</p>

<p>And those equations are usually amazingly compact.</p>

<p>You say that&#39;s easy? It&#39;s like building a time machine out of 5 basic materials with nothing else and finding out at the end that it actually works <strong>and</strong> fits in your pocket.</p>

<p>So yes, it is possible that one or more the fundamental axioms behind math are wrong, meaning that all of math that we&#39;ve ever concocted is faulty. But the odds of a made-up, faulty system perfectly predicting everything we see around us - matching measurement to the most precise decimal place we can measure?</p>

<p>Let&#39;s just say I&#39;d want any competing theory to do <strong>at least</strong> as good before I&#39;d be willing to even entertain it.</p>

<p>i&#39;m going to look into the TP, i won&#39;t be able to understand much, but it is interesting and going off that i think it gives credibility to the idea of SOME math and physics being completely false</p>

<p>people will spend their whole lives studying a certain model that can&#39;t even be known for certain yet to them its truth, mainstream science blows my mind</p>

<p>How can you prove that is how a computer works? Why take someone elses word for it? </p>

<p>Same with globe Earth. Unless youre an astronaut or have access to a high altitude plane or balloon you have to use your own intuition to figure it out (Again if you dont believe all the images we have from space or dont believe in the people who spend years learning this trade). </p>

<p>In a computer we can think of certain tests to run that will or will not verify that a computer is an electrical system dependent on the correct flow of electricity to function, even if we cant watch an electron move through the system. </p>

<p>How small is that centrifugal force? Lets stop looking at the speed for a moment and think about it like this. </p>

<p>A tennis ball spinning at 1000+ MPH is moving fast, you would feel that if you were small enough to be on it. </p>

<p>Now lets say that the tennis ball makes one full rotation every 24 hours, you would barely even register that. </p>

<p>Same with the Earth, yes its moving fast but it only makes one rotation every 24 hours. The centrifugal forces are very small. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Or go on a carousel that is sealed from the outside air, will you feel the spin or not?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If the carousel made one rotation every 24 hours you wouldnt even notice it turning. When you are on a plane why do you not fly back and hit the wall at 500mph if you jump? Because both you, the plane and everything in it are moving at the same speed. </p>

<p>Its still going to take 24 hours for that spot to rotate 360 degrees. Not enough to notice. You are however a little heavier at the north pole because of the slight centrifugal force in place at the equator</p>

<p>The centrifugal force is what makes the Earth bulge ever so slightly in the middle, like spinning pizza dough. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lets go back to your carousel example but make the carousel much bigger. Like the size of the Earth. </p>

<p>So the carousel is moving the same speed, one rotation every 24 hours. The &quot;top&quot; (North Pole) is moving slowly. </p>

<p>People at the edge of the carousel are moving much faster. Now when you walk out to the edge you are accelerating at an incredibly slow rate, just making shit up here but lets say every step accelerates you .000001% faster. </p>

<p>When you reach the edge you, the carousel and everything on the carousel are moving the same speed. Much like on an airplane or bus, you can jump and land in the same spot because you are moving at the same speed as the carousel. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why is it any different if I am moving at x amount of speed with a big big surface or x amount with smaller surface? Why does one make you feel it and the other makes you not?</p>

I&#39;ve lived on a island on and off my whole life, as long as I&#39;ve been alive I could see the shore on the other side, I never thought much of it till I came across FE theory. Now you&#39;ll find videos all over the place of people zooming in on distant objects over land, this makes sense to me because land has variations which let you defy curvature(mountains, valleys, etc) ... but put a glass of water on a table, sits flat right? So in theory if you viewed a distant shore, the water in between should follow the curvature strictly. It doesn&#39;t. </p>

<p>Now according to the formula for calculating the curvature of the earth , that shore  which I&#39;ve been viewing which is 17 miles away , should be SIGNIFICANTLY below the horizon. Explain that too me please and don&#39;t say mirage, you can see the other shore in almost any weather condition</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No... Thats not how parallax calculations would work. </p>

<p>So lets assume a FE. Lets say I have someone at the very bottom tip of south America and anther buddy at the very southern tip of Australia. </p>

<p>Now on a FE map this is about as far from each other as you can get. You both take measurements of your relation to a celestial body, like Mars (Or the moon). </p>

<p>Since you are tens of thousands of miles apart there should be slightly different results of your calculations. Im sure we remember A<sup>2</sup> + B<sup>2</sup> = C<sup>2</sup></p>

<p>If we do this experiment we know A and B so we can calculate C. This is how parallax works. </p>

<p>Yes... There must be something affecting both things with different densities. What is the force that compels things to fall to Earth? </p>

<p>I get that. What I dont get is what force is causing different densities to find this equilibrium. If its not gravity then what causes a ball to fall to the floor? If it is density then that means there is a force pulling both the air and the ball in the same direction. </p>

<p>We can actually test density theory pretty easily. </p>

<p>Create a vacuum sealed box with a brick in it. If there is no air (A minimally dense object) and a highly dense object like the brick will the brick float and will the weight of the box change? </p>

<p>Then how will objects of different density separate? What is causing them to be attracted to the Earth? </p>

<p>You cant just say density and be done with it. Dense things separate because they are all being attracted in the same direction. Without a force attracting them density will not work. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>This is another theory we can easily test. </p>

<p>We can make EM shielded boxes. Put a brick in a shielded box and see if the weight changes. We could do both a shielded box and one with a vacuum. If you can show that this box weighs a different amount you are looking at completely debunking gravity. </p>

<p>Now if there is no change in weight we know its not EM or density alone. We know there is a force that doesnt act on EM or density and that attraction is based on mass. </p>

<p>If I mix oil and water they will eventually separate. Two objects of different densities will separate, which is what I assume you mean. So a brick is more dense than air so the brick will sink to the bottom (The ground) when tossed. </p>

<p>The question is why is the brick moving down? What force is pulling both the air and the brick downwards?</p>

<p>Why does it fall down? Why is a less dense object wanting to fall to the ground? Gravity says that objects are attracted to the center of objects with mass. So the brick is attracted to the center of the Earths gravitational pull. </p>

<p>You cant have density without a force pulling all objects to the ground. </p>

<p>In an electric universe (As far as I understand it) electric fields permeate everything and cause things to be attracted to each other. We can shield against electrical forces very effectively. </p>

<p>Im not really sure where the disconnect is coming from... </p>

<p>You cant have things separate by density if there is no force acting on them to pull them in the same direction. Whatever that might be, EU or Gravity. There must be something pull all objects towards the Earth for things to separate by density. </p>

<ul>
<li>Why are all objects attracted to other objects with mass? </li>
</ul>

<p>THe only thing unknown about gravity is the mechanism. We know that there is an attraction between all objects with mass. We can very accurately predict how objects will interact with each other based on our model of gravity. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>A more dense object has to fall, it can not rise because only less dense objects fall, and it can not move sideways because sideways the density stays the same.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Again to have objects reach balance according to their respective densities it implies that they &quot;want&quot; to settle, which means there must be a force that attracts them to the Earth. </p>

<p>If there were no gravity or no attractive force they would never separate, regardless of their density. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Down and up are labels we put on the facts that in a medium less dense objects fall and more dense rise. Same density stays floating. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again fall and rise implies there is a general direction of &quot;down&quot; which means that something is attracting objects towards the center of the Earth. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>If there was gravity then same density object in a same density medium would be pulled downwards, but is this the case?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, this is the case. All objects want to move closer to the center of the Earth. If two objects are the same density being pulled in the same direction they will achieve equilibrium. </p>

<p>If it was only density then there would be no attraction and the items wouldnt achieve equilibrium. They would just float. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>But we do know why and its provable. Gravity. </p>

<p>We know for a fact that mass is attracted to each other, we know by exactly how much also. Gravity can perfectly model out universe and can predict future events very accurately. </p>

<p>The mechanism isnt known but we do know that mass equals attraction. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Just like with gravity theory there is no reason for why should there be attraction, why should attraction be something that happens instead of the opposite which is things repelling? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because it bends the fabric of space. We can see this with Einstein halos where the large gravity of the sun bends the light on the other side around it. We know this is a fact, we can prove this. </p>

<p>Electric universe however cant explain this phenomena as far as I know. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Why cant density be the its own force?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because it needs an attractive force acting on both densities the same. Without gravity you cant have density. It wouldnt matter how dense an object is if it isnt attracted in a direction. </p>

<p>Look at zero gravity. This can be however you imagine, like the vomit comet. If I have a bowling ball in a tub of water in zero gravity it wont sink to the bottom. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you take rubber band and stretch it and let go, it will snap back.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well there is energy stored in that band because you pulled it apart. In this analogy if a brick and the earth are a rubber band where is the energy coming from to pull themselves together? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Likewise if you take a rock from the surface of the earth where it rests and lift it upwards against the opposing density and let go, it will snap back because it finds its balance and earth is what stops it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But why is it resting? Why is it sitting on the Earth? It cant be just density. Why does it want to fall to the Earth? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>We dont know that mass equals attraction, its only a model, it has not been proven, that is why gravity is theory and not an observeable fact of reality. It has never been observed unlike the natural properties of density.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It has been proven multiple times. What we cant definitively answer is &quot;why&quot;. </p>

<p>You have the burden of showing that you have a model that is as exact as gravitation. No one has proved such a thing, no other model fits what we observe. Like density, why would density cause planets to orbit objects? Why would density cause gravitational lensing? These questions cant be answered using the density model but can in the gravitational model. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>If I tell you that the big bang was started by an outside force (because it can not be its own cause) and I call that force god, you would not believe me since we can not directly observe it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>By definition we cant know what started it. You can however directly view gravity in effect, just get a telescope. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>No matter how good of a model I create out of the stuff that came after the force, if I can not show that this force actually exists you wont believe.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again science isnt denying this. What is denied is how else do you explain it? No one has made a model that comes close to explaining and modelling our universe. </p>

<p>No. No one has proven the mechanism for gravity, that is all. We have a very good understanding of how gravity works as proven by our ability to model very accurate predictions of our solar system. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also we can observe of the universe only lights in the sky. I dont trust nasa or other space organisations since I cant verify them myself.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I can tell you for a fact that the other planets are globes. You can verify this yourself. Either get or borrow a telescope or observatories routinely have nights where you can take a look through their equipment. They arent lights, they are definitely globes and we (You) can see them orbit, you can even see their moons if you get a nice enough telescope. </p>

<p>There is zero reason not to look into this. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>In nasas website they call them images, not pictures. There is a difference, a picture is real photo and an image can be made up.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That isnt true. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also we know they use composite images and not actual photographs like that nasa guy who made the blue marble said, he admitted that the images are photoshopped.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>NASA never once hid the fact they were composite, it is right in every single press release they make. The guy who photshopped those images gave his reasoning, again never once hidden. </p>

<p>Since most satellites fly low (At like 250-300 miles I think) they cant take a single image of the entire Earth so they take dozens if not hundreds of pictures then stitch them together. Since these photos were taken at different time cloud patterns wont be the same, it would look like shit. </p>

<p>So he meshed everything together to make it fit. You cant admit something you never denied in the first place. </p>

<p>There is a satellite launched last year called DSCOVR-EPIC that sits 100k miles away from Earth and routinely take unedited untouched photos of Earth. The Chinese also the Himawari satellite that does similar. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Objects that are more dense or less dense than the medium they are in will move towards the direction that will result them to be at the same density as the medium in which they are i</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Only if there is already a force acting on them making them want to be on the ground. </p>

<p>I do not know how else to explain this. If there were no force acting on them making them want to move &quot;down&quot; their density wouldnt matter. </p>

<p>Again back to my zero G analogy. Density doesnt matter if there is no force attracting them downwards. </p>

<p>If I put a brick and some feathers in a back they all float in there together, it isnt until gravity comes into play that the brick sinks to the bottom of the bag. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>No need for gravity in this statement.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There needs to be something. </p>

<p>I really dont get how you arent getting this. </p>

<p>The moon is tidally locked... There are surface features on mars, for example, we can see those features rotate and disappear from view, same with their moons. </p>

<p>You can see a moon pass in front of a planet and then disappear behind it before coming out of the other side. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>But... that isnt how density works! This is getting ridiculous. </p>

<p>Those objects all have the same density regardless. Here is a literal middle school definition of density</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Density is a characteristic property of a substance.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The density of a substance is the relationship between the mass of the substance and how much space it takes up (volume).</strong></p></li>
<li><p>The mass of atoms, their size, and how they are arranged determine the density of a substance.</p></li>
<li><p>Density equals the mass of the substance divided by its volume; D = m/v.</p></li>
<li><p>Objects with the same volume but different mass have different densities.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>You cant negate density. It would be like saying you can make steel less dense by throwing it up. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The plane is not actually outside of earths supposed gravity so why would gravity then not effect the objects in the plane?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because its flying in a parabola that simulates a zero G environment. So gravity is pulling everything towards the Earth at 9.81m/s<sup>2</sup> if you control a descent at that rate you are falling at the correct speed to negate that. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>You have stated it but I said very early that I am not bying that.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Dude you just dont understand your own argument very well. You do not understand what density is and why it wont work unless there is a force acting on it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Something I want to point out is that math can be correct while being used for a false model.  It&#39;s very easy to develop mathematics that match what we observe because there&#39;s plenty you can change in concept as long as you balance the equation.  For instance, the sun and the moon look about the same in the sky but we&#39;re told the sun is around 400 times bigger but 400 times further away.  So the math works out that they <em>could</em> be those distances and sizes while matching what we see, but it doesn&#39;t prove that it&#39;s so.</p>

<p>As long as you balance both sides of the equation, the math will match our observation.  Natural phenomena, especially those in the sky, have been documented for millennia by ancient peoples.  All our current model does is take these established observational patterns and use mathematics to describe them in different terms.  Change the distances, change the sizes, invent values for mass.  The math will always work out the same because they&#39;re just altering the equations while ensuring the results remain consistent with what mankind has always observed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yaaa i getcha, i&#39;m not arguing over 1+1=2, i&#39;m saying 1 + 1 = 2 because that&#39;s what we have made it, anything we know comes from our ability to describe  somethin, if i goto china, i no longer know what anything is, i know what things do, but if i cant relate to a different language, i no longer know how to describe something in a way that works for them, drunk n stoned, my apologies, giberish i know, but point of my gibberish is if we are talking about ways for us to describe something and we are in the position of power too dictate how people do it, then we can can describe whatever however we want</p>

<p>this came out so wrong and retarded lolol oh well, i hope you see MY logic, think about the number one, is it shaped 1 because the world came together and said thats the most logical? or us ut because somewhere in hisrory that rule was set? (probably with special meaning)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can directly view natural things that are attributed to this magical invisible force gravity, but no one has observed gravity itself. This is why its called the theory of gravity.</p>

<p>Also we can observe of the universe only lights in the sky. I dont trust nasa or other space organisations since I cant verify them myself. In nasas website they call them images, not pictures. There is a difference, a picture is real photo and an image can be made up. Also we know they use composite images and not actual photographs like that nasa guy who made the blue marble said, he admitted that the images are photoshopped.</p>

<p>Objects that are more dense or less dense than the medium they are in will move towards the direction that will result them to be at the same density as the medium in which they are in or until they meet a physical barrier that stops them from moving towards that direction. No need for gravity in this statement.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you are on an object that is spinning on its axis, how can you not feel the centrifugal force? Even if it is a closed system? </p>

<p>Can you replicate that with items here on earth? Make a ball and create for it a sealed atmosphere out of something solid material like plastic and then spin it and see what happens to the items on the ball.</p>
