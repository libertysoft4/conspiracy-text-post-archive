<p>2.) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXHdILOBKf4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXHdILOBKf4</a></p>

<p>The first thing I wonder is could this guy look anymore like Israeli Mossad?</p>

<p>Notice he gives an incorrect account twice, where he says that the car reverses and then smashes people a second time, which clearly does not occur in any videos we see. To me, this is a sign that multiple takes or scenes were shot and/or that he is fumbling over the script.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure there are those who will say that his spastic demeanor is a sign of &quot;true shock,&quot; the same people who thought it was totally normal that no Sandy Hook parents ever cried. Of course he does not cry either, even when contorting his face in an attempt to look horrified. </p>

<p>This post is for those who can spot a bad liar when they see one. </p>

<p>Notice also that he repeats parts of the script, such as &quot;there was a girl on the ground she was tore up she tried to get up.&quot; He also stops at the exact same moment in each interview where he presumably becomes &quot;too emotional.&quot;</p>

<p>There was another witness named Jon Ziegler who gave the same incorrect account of the car backing up and hitting again, but I&#39;m having trouble finding this video and many are indeed already being removed.</p>

<p>I did find this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ewxba5-vdhA">video</a> of Ziegler, who like our bearded friend also happens to be Jewish. He also says there&#39;s no license plates on the car which is incorrect, and makes sure to randomly specify that &quot;Unicorn Riot&quot; is not a group of paid protestors, but a not-for-profit media organization. Odd information for a guy who narrowly avoided death and just witnessed such horror.</p>

<p>He also seems to be covered inexplicably with leftover baby powder from the Boston Hoaxathon Bombing. </p>

<p>Bonus: at <a href="https://youtu.be/KCXR0R58KX4?t=50s">0:50</a> in the first video you can see a girl laughing and a guy smirking.</p>

<p>So go ahead and enjoy: shills feel free to comment that I&#39;m &quot;defending Nazis&quot; or that this is &quot;totally normal,&quot; and people with working brains sit back and have a laugh at this overdone deception.</p>

<p>Also I&#39;m assuming that people have seen the video of the suspect&#39;s mother as well, because it is also odd to say the least. She is told her son basically just murdered someone and continues on almost laughing, unfazed by this news. And they make sure to insert and emphasize the &quot;alt-right&quot; buzz word.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>haha did you see that vid I posted where the ADL went after David Icke because they thought that his &quot;reptilians=the evil manipulating force we can all sense but have a hard time naming&quot; theory <em>sounded</em> too close to Jews? lol So, then, with no evidence, they call these meetings where, based on an implicit agreement that Icke is &quot;bad for the community&quot;, they threaten radio stations to not have Icke appear, intimidate book stores to get him thrown out, grill him on camera, asking him if lizards=Jews, and he was like &quot;no, look at me, this is not a Jewish conspiracy&quot;, and the interviewer was like &quot;it&#39;s just that when you say &quot;it&#39;s not a Jewish conspiracy&quot;, people say it&#39;s a metaphor for &quot;it&#39;s a Jewish conspiracy&quot;. lol And that&#39;s not even the best part. </p>

<p>So, Icke keeps doing his thing, talking about lizards and shit, signing books in the shops that will have him, and this group of Jews gets together and makes shitty lizard costumes, buys some pies, goes to his signing, tries to call him an anti-semite, to which the audience is like &quot;wait wut&quot;, and they throw the pies at him and run, most not hitting him and instead landing on the children&#39;s book section behind him. It was, like, holy shit, this is how they handle their business, it&#39;s not so mystical and occult, it&#39;s just a group of conscienceless douchebags deciding to use subversion and shitty politics to fight the battles that they should fight with integrity and honor. </p>

<p>I dunno, man. The more I learn about all the political action groups surrounding Jews, the more I see that this stuff is not only something that they might do, but could be argued to be their modus operandi. </p>

<p>You&#39;re proceeding from the point that this is automatically a false flag. </p>

<p>You described some stuff to do with Icke that bears no resemblance to what happened in Virginia.</p>

<p>I&#39;m asking the OP where he gets the information that this guy looks like Mossad. </p>

<p>You&#39;re saying Jewish action groups use aggressive protest tactics. Are you saying the counter protestors were Jewish or as OP said, Mossad?</p>

<p>You do need to explain yourself because right now you look like you&#39;re out to pin anything possible on Jews.</p>

<p>And that&#39;s relevant, given the rally we saw in Charlottesville.</p>

<p>However, you say he&#39;s a trained actor who was expecting this, so there should be no reason to fumble over this script, especially twice, if he were trained and expecting this whole thing.  </p>

<p>I&#39;d say his reactions are pretty consistent with someone who just witnessed something so horrifying and is obviously distraught.  But sure, I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve been in similar situations and have been perfectly level-headed, so who am I to judge. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are we watching the same videos? You&#39;re either delusional or have never been in a chaotic situation where the news media are covering it. It happens in any sort of crowd environment.</p>

<p>It happens all the time that the same person is talked to. One reporter sees the interview and tries to snag the same person for a few reasons. Primarily it is that when one reporter sees the another talking to someone they will snag them as well because they are nearby and have the time or are a least willing to talk. I&#39;ve had it happen to me in far less chaotic situations than this one.</p>

<p>Definitely don&#39;t draw the same conclusions about their description of events that you do (including your followups in the thread). I don&#39;t hear anyone saying the car rammed forwards twice.

    <div class="md"><p>Great post, thanks for the analysis. This event has many hallmarks of a hoax / false flag event, including:</p>

<p>1) Potato quality video of the crash itself
2) Pink all over the frame of the first crash video, on flags, protestors (seems to be common and prominent colour at suspected false flag events, perhaps a fear programming technique)
3) Missing shoes on the injured (masonic symbolism)
4) Many inconsistencies and questions about vehicle and driver
5) The unexplained police helo crash / fireball - very suspicious
6) Number plate has two &#39;11s&#39; in it, suspect&#39;s mother&#39;s plate has 1122 - both are significant for numerology)
7) And of course... shitty crisis actors giving unconvincing interviews</p>

<p>Did I miss anything?</p>
