        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>And call them out when we see them. The media just didn&#39;t randomly start obsessing over black shootings by police, BLM protests, cop killings, ect. The social engineers are pushing this on us. It&#39;s so fucking obvious if you have been paying attention since 2012, that they are trying to &quot;stir a pot&quot; of social hysteria.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like a soup they are brewing. A dash of Nazi protests, a hint of SJW social media reactions, a pinch of the transgender movement, and just a hair of police brutality. All of this is pushed in the media.</p>

<p>Guys. They are getting ready to PTRO.</p>

<p>Pull The Rug Out. They&#39;re orchestrating this collapse of the economy and society simultaneously, so that when the shit hits the fan, we are all divided and can&#39;t unite against them. </p>

<p>Please, do your research into the history of divide and conquer tactics. </p>

<p>My idea is to flood the masses with the concept of the &quot;divide and conquer&quot; race war. If they become aware of this, then these provocateured events lose their value to TPTB (The powers that be), and we can subvert their sadistic plans to pit us against one another. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem I see withe the fallout of this attack is, as OP states, the <em>legalization</em> of open violence against certain groups, backed by tacit support of MSM. People, from anonymous net users to late show comedians, celebrities and politicians, already have <em>normalized</em> threats of physical violence against Trump an his cabinet. Also, twitter and such is filled with <em>a 100 nazi scalps</em> comments, that don&#39;t cause banning of accounts and are retweeted by <em>sensible</em> activists. </p>

<p>Now, after a person died, her death will be a justification for even more extreme actions: a Congressman has already been shot, how long until others are? How long until a mob of <em>progressive, enlightened, inclusive</em> people that hate Trump attack someone just for wearing a Trump hat? For saying <em>the wrong thing</em> on a checkout line? </p>

<p>No, I&#39;m not a Trump supporter at all, but the division that was already hurting us before the election has been widened by both sides and as always, the players above moving the strings reap the strategic benefits while us cannon fodder get mowed down, and made to hate each other.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying his actions and fumbles don&#39;t deserve scorn and critique, he&#39;s still the stupid egotist that ran an election based on soundbites and empty promises.

<p>I packed my shit in 2012 and left America when it was clear no one was going to wake up, and the way people talk they still are not </p>

<p>The buying power of the dollar is at an 100 year low INSIDE America- ignore its international value </p>

<p>Look at the Big Mac index, a very clear and easy way to gauge buying power- currently a value meal at McDonald&#39;s is $3 in most of the world- china, Africa, the Middle East- but inside America it is currently $8-10 or higher!</p>

<p>Your dollar is becoming worth less money inside America while your salary is going down at the same fucking time!</p>

<p>Ever wonder why he has never came out and distanced himself vocally from these racist people? Like I would wanna clear the fucking air and clear my name from being associated with these people.</p>

<p>He was chosen as a catalyst for this racial divide and collapse. It&#39;s all part of the &quot;script&quot;!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem here is the media fueled hysteria that is bundling all types of right-leaning groups with the nazi tag. Quite handy for stifling diversity of ideas (at least the ones that might be <em>incovenient</em>), but very likely to alienate and radicalize those that will end up being ostracized and attacked, this time with the blessing of <em>public opinion</em>. </p>
