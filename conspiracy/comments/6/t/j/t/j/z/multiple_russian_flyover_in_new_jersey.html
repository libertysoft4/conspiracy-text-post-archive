I live very close to bedminster NJ where the President often spends time. Today I saw with my own eyes a Russian TU-154 escorted by two US F22 fighters.  This is the third time we have seen it happen. The first was in mid July and it did not make the news. The second was earlier this week, but not the same day as the preannnounced flyover in DC. The third was today. They flew very low. First we saw the f22s. They circled back 2nd time,  then the Russian jet flew over. </p>

<p>Russia should use its special services within the borders of the United States to fuel instability and separatism, for instance, provoke &quot;Afro-American racists&quot;. Russia should &quot;introduce geopolitical disorder into internal American activity, encouraging all kinds of separatism and ethnic, social and racial conflicts, actively supporting all dissident movements – extremist, racist, and sectarian groups, thus destabilizing internal political processes in the U.S. It would also make sense simultaneously to support isolationist tendencies in American politics.&quot;[1]</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Love and peace my ass. The same side responsible for riots in LA, Ferguson, and Baltimore. The same side that lit cars and vandalized stores, and prevented citizens from witnessing inauguration, in DC. The side that attacks trump voters for wearing a t shirt. The side that was caught on tape saying they throw acid at Trump supporters. Meanwhile yelling and screaming we are the victims. The same side that is unsure what bathroom to use and that genital mutilation is empowering, not a mental health issue. Now these are just off the top of my head, but give me a break. </p>

<p>I didn&#39;t bring any politics into our discussion, but it seems you truly want to associate a violent person with all trump voters, which is sad. Its a tactic similar to Russia, just make this presidency as difficult as possible. Division in Congress and in the public, and watch the wheels come off the cart. </p>

<p>Nothing to gain being at odds, I just call bullshit out. And 90% of users here are Russian is bullshit, regardless of my political leanings</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Summer should be comforting but it isn’t this year. Looking at the young today, when I watch them in their leisure; I catch a fearful resemblance to the faces of the young from my generation in the summer of 1939. When I am out in town, I listen to their laughter, I watch them enjoying a pint or wooing one another, and I am afraid for them.</p>

<p>This August resembles too much that of 1939; the last summer of peace until 1945. Then aged 16 and still wet behind the ears, I’d go to pictures with my mates and we’d laugh at the newsreels of Hitler and other fascist monsters that lived beyond what we thought was our reach. Little did we know in that August 1939, life without peace, without carnage, without air raids, without the blitz, could be measured in days. I did not hear the thundering approach of war, but as an old man I hear it now for my grandchildren’s generation. I hope I am wrong. But I am petrified for them.</p>

<p>Because I am old, now 94, I recognise these omens of doom. Chilling signs are everywhere, perhaps the biggest being that the US allows itself to be led by Donald Trump, a man deficient in honour, wisdom and just simple human kindness. It is as foolish for Americans to believe that their generals will save them from Trump as it was for liberal Germans to believe the military would protect the nation from Hitler’s excesses.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ahem, nice copy pasta from a UK source, lmao. Another association between the likeness of Trump and Nazis, how tiring. Honestly, how do you think an elderly person who lives outside of America, has a political opinion? They are so word, fought the Nazis, lives in England, has their finger on the pulse of amercian politics, is able bodies for 94(cruises town sees the youth) it&#39;s truly an amazing story, especially one which ties Trump with Nazis. I mean that&#39;s almost too convienent, and most undoubtedly a crock of shit not written by an old man. Then you realize it&#39;s all a shameless plug for a book.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s one major fucking difference, trump is killing millions.</p>
