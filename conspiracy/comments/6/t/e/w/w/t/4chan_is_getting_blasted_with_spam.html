    <div class="md"><p>4chan has been blasted with spam for awhile now. And if you are talking about /pol/, then why do you expect much from that board? That board was compromised years ago. Generally 4chan was one of the earliest places that was used to experiment social engineering techniques before put on a larger scale towards the rest of the Web. I remember /n/ (news), long ago, such a different place then... 
but I will admit there are still moments of clarity, not often. This place isn&#39;t that much better, just less memes. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m worried it&#39;s not the usual pol crowd, people not interested in discussion have began to move in bigger numbers. Trying to turn everything into a shouting match because that&#39;s all they know. My gut says people will get tired of it who aren&#39;t interested in the content and are only motivated by getting to tell off &#39;nazis&#39;. Usually in waves of shilling people develop a different perspective just by being exposed to the information talked about there, but I worry the shills fucked up the ratios of quality posts to see and have to think about </p>

Not that they are credible, <a href="https://youtu.be/J_L7cciuB1Y">the footage speaks for it&#39;self though</a> what i would like to see is the footage of the police officer claimed to have said the order to &#39;stand down&#39; from the Mayor. The whole thing stinks of the kind of shit that&#39;s been going on here in Northern Ireland for decades, the state playing the people against themselves. </p>

But one thing i&#39;ve come to accept based on experience of growing up in N.Ire and working as an engineer for the BBC (supporting technical equipment reporters and producers use) i am left tainted about the truth ever being revealed.

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely. I&#39;ve been working on ways to convey new ideas effectively and music is a big outlet for me. If something just sounds good the sound of the words themselves can get stuck in your head. Like you don&#39;t think of the meaning behind the words or even that you&#39;re hearing a word, it&#39;s just such a good tune that the singers vocal cords are an instrument and you just think of the tones. I smile thinking of a sentiment with the power to awaken someone stuck in the heads of the people for no other reason at first than its sound making people happy </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know most people don&#39;t like his music, but B.O.B. Has been producing album after album, all of which are centered around conspiracies and truth spreading. I don&#39;t know if he is a big name (fake rabbit hole generator) but it&#39;s interesting to listen to. If you produce any music and don&#39;t mind sharing I would gladly give it a listen and let you know what I think about it. Between tom delonge, and BoB, we might actually have a chance to produce music that informs the public.</p>
