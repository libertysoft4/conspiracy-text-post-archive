<p>Hey check this out , if Antifas ideas are that good they should sell themselves  it doesn&#39;t need to show up with weapons like they always do to force ideas that just means the ideas are already awful, obviously,  otherwise everyone would agree. Inciting riots that get people killed everywhere it goes means they are not convincing anyone of anything.</p>

<p>Antifa is a violent group on outdated ideas that failed and they cause riots and deaths. </p>

<p>America was built on that premise though? A bunch of people showed up, bows/swords/rifles in hand and decided to start violently liberating &#39;your&#39; country from Native Americans, did they not? </p>

<p>Nazis/KKK members ALSO showed up weapons in open carry holster or rifle across back, with the threat to use them. Both sides were legally allowed to have the weapons they had on them. </p>

<p>Why is it always the other side that needs to address their problems? Why can&#39;t both sides look at themselves with a little self awareness and go &quot;you know what, we&#39;re all being pretty fucking stupid here&quot;?</p>

<p>It&#39;s 2017 no one is alive from 1492. No one alive owes anyone for things they did not do, except basic human respect which has LONG been paid, ironically it is the left who wants to erase even history so it is rather a hypocritical double standard argument.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I ain&#39;t defending Richard Spencer, clear as that. If they literally say black people are lesser, they won&#39;t be defended by me. I&#39;d hope most of the right leaning users will completely agree with that.</p>

<p>You can try and make it so they represent the entirety of people who aren&#39;t the left, and Facebook and Reddit are already doing it.</p>

<p>This is what I hate above all else, this ability to spread fake news and memes. You know Facebook had one showing a sign up in Charlottesville saying something positive, the meme said that they were posted on all the store fronts. How do I know that, do I take some memers advice? Do I just like it an move on because it&#39;s positive.</p>

<p>Now this is everywhere online and I can&#39;t figure out what is truly going on, especially since the numbers for these events are memeified half the time instead of actually displaying the real numbers.</p>

<p>IF THERE IS A REAL GODDAMN NAZI PRESENCE, THEN FOR THE LOVE OF FUCK, SOMEONE RUN A BOOK WITH NUMBERS AT THE RALLY&#39;S. IF I SEE ONE MORE &quot;DOZENS&quot; OR &quot;EN MASSE&quot; IN A FUCKING ARTICLE IM GONNA SNAP.</p>

<p>There is a lot of info on the astroturfing organizations Correct the Record, ShareBlue and Media Matters.

<p>An Oxford research paper on astroturfing:</p>

<p>From this Oxford research paper on astroturfing:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There is no doubt that individual social media users can spread hate speech, troll other users, or set up automated political communication campaigns. Unfortunately, this is also an organized phenomenon, with major governments and political parties dedicating significant resources towards the use of social media for public opinion manipulation.</p>

<p>... In many countries, political actors have no reported ability to field social media campaigns. In some countries, one or two known political actors occasionally use social media for political messaging, and in a few other countries there are multiple government agencies, political parties, or civil society groups organizing trolling and fake news campaigns.</p>

Everything I post and comment I also receive a lot of backlash, almost entirely from T_D theorists. Brigading is a thing, shills are a thing, reddit is not neutral. Ok. But don&#39;t use it as an excuse to just dismiss everyone who doesnt agree with you. This is r/conspiracy, not your safe space at T_D where you instaban anyone with an opinion (r/politics operates the same way just with more up votes instead of banning). </p>

<p><sup>that</sup> may be your problem here. What is the &quot;us&quot; you are referring to? It really, really sounds like you are referencing T_D in context to the &quot;nazi&quot; and &quot;shill&quot; rhetoric. Like, to a &quot;T&quot; (_D) &lt;---pun intended. Honestly tho it&#39;s not like I&#39;m gonna check everyone&#39;s posy history before I comment. If I see rhetoric like libtard, cuck, shill etc... it&#39;s 99% gonna be a trumper. I get where you&#39;re coming from but don&#39;t be offended or surprised when your post turns into a war between T_D users and T_D haters. </p>
