<p>2) From the video footage we&#39;ve all probably seen by now, you can see a large group of protesters surrounding the vehicle; before, during and after the incident. Does any one else think it&#39;s strange that out of the 40 to 50 people surrounding the vehicle, not ONE of them got a clear photograph or video of the drivers face? It seems that someone who was close by and saw what happened would have tried to get a clear image of the driver for evidence.. but there is not one clear image.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s hear your thoughts</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In a way, yes it does.</p>

<p>That picture does not support the conclusion that she sustained fatal injuries. It adds to the suspicion that this lady only sustained light injuries, if any.</p>

<p>Do we know how she allegedly died? Was it a head injury, internal injury, external bleeding?</p>

<p>How long would her legs have to be to get pinned between the cars in that shot? Unless there&#39;s a better angle I&#39;d say she is fully on top of the car&#39;s hood.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And if you take it one step further: Maybe the reason no clear photos of the driver&#39;s face were released or even captured was because staged protesters/operatives new in advance that the attack was going to take place and were instructed not to take photos of the driver. </p>

<p>The other scenario is that clear photos of the driver&#39;s face actually were taken, but were confiscated by authorities so that they could selectively choose which photos and videos they would release to the press.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If they were withholding photos due to the investigation, then why would they release <em>any</em> photos or videos? Your logic doesn&#39;t make sense here.

<p>Even if this were true, it only furthers the case for this conspiracy. It would make it seem like they only released photos and videos that fit the official narrative while not allowing any others to be seen (because those photos don&#39;t fit the narrative).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you kidding me? No one is alleging that the attack didn&#39;t happen. What we are questioning is the official media narrative of what happened: &quot;Crazed white supremacist angrily dives car into crowd of peaceful counter-protesters&quot;. This was the headline being shoved down everyone&#39;s throats almost <em>immediately</em> after the incident. Headlines like these are meant to create a strong emotional response and have worked very well at causing a huge outrage (as was intended). If you are the type of person that blindly accepts what the MSM tells you without question, then you would already be in a heightened emotional state after reading the headlines, <em>before</em> looking at the evidence.</p>

<p>This is about not accepting authority, thinking critically, and using observation skills to assess what may have happened (instead of just believing what they say on TV). I personally do not believe ANYTHING I see or read from the MSM. If anything, it&#39;s only useful purpose is to give us a glimpse of what TPTB want you to believe.</p>

<p>Often times when tragedies like this occur, it is not a completely <em>organic</em> event. What I mean by this is that there could be and more than likely actually is more to the story than what we are being told. There are multiple inconsistencies within the MSM narrative of what happened. The purpose of my post was to highlight what are in my opinion the most glaring inconsistencies that damage the official narrative.</p>

<p>Make sense now?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would like to see an image of his front windshield before he hits anything or anyone. Some have implied his front windshield was damaged before <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_orKYk_Q28E">this video starts</a>. @ the start of that video a screech, a possible flaring of weary type screaming &amp; a slight possibility of smacking sound can be heard. I would need to see evidence to verify such claims of the windshield being smashed pre~rampage to add weight to such claims.</p>

<p>I do know as he was already seemingly dangerously heading into the crowd <a href="https://i.imgur.com/XueTOhZ.jpg">a person unwisely in an illegal manner slammed a bat like object into the rear bumper</a> that could have sounded like a gunshot to the driver just before hitting the crowd. I do feel he was already about to hit the crowd @ that point though. </p>

<p>I find it odd that if he was wanting to kill the opposite side with a super extreme malice mindset he did not seemingly fully gun that hot rod after the screech @ the beginning of the video. It seems like a small rev after the screech then a steady rate but not a continue of the rev pedal to the metal flooring forth as he continues into the crowd.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe his glasses came off when he rammed into the cars and people. And instead of searching the floor for them, he tried to make a hasty retreat.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While what you&#39;re saying is possible, it seems pretty unlikely. Also, don&#39;t you think it would have been kind of difficult to exit the scene the way he did if his glasses had fallen off? He reverses his vehicle at about 15 to 20mph, completely straight, for two blocks, without hitting any parked vehicles.. seems like he might need to have his glasses on to pull that off.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hadn&#39;t seen the picture of the person who died. I have been sorta avoiding this story because of all the controversy surrounding it. I didn&#39;t need another frustrating thing saturated with propaganda to care about in my life. It is an emotional dumptruck of bullshit. </p>
