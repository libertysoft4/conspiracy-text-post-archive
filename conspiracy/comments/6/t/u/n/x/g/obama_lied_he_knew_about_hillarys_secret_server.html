<p>“Jen you probably have more on this but it looks like POTUS just said he found out HRC was using her personal email when he saw it in the news… we need to clean this up - he has emails from her - they do not say state.gov”</p>

<p>“How is that not classified?” Huma Abedin to FBI when shown email between Clinton &amp; Obama using his pseudonym. Abedin then expressed her amazement at the president’s use of a pseudonym and asked if she could have a copy of the email.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The server was used as a way to circumvent the freedom of information act so that they could avoid requests as well as avoid conversations with Ted Cruz. He tends to email a lot. The downfall was that the server was insecure and they did not protect it as they should have. There is a lot of stuff they don&#39;t want everyone seeing for whatever reason. Some of it is actually reasonable. Most of it is not. Clinton was following typical protocol.</p>

And in the last year there is nothing in any news outlet that has published anything in the english language as explosive as that specific email. To rank that at number 20 tells me either the author of the website doesnt know too much about what they are doing or that the entire thing is as close a limited hangout as they could muster given the circumstance. </p>

So it would require the political will of congress to charge that and that would require the complete decay of his supporters.</p>

<p>I believe that that decay is happening and that his base was small (in numbers) to begin with... I won&#39;t point you to polls or to the fact that Hillary Clinton received 3 million more votes, because I know you will inherently disagree and I&#39;m not going to debate the facts if we can&#39;t agree on a premise.</p>

<p>As for the map comparing blue counties to red counties, come on now, that&#39;s just silly... far more people live in the blue than in the red and a cursory google search would tell you that fact. But you shouldn&#39;t need to be told that fact if you&#39;ve done any significant traveling throughout the United States.</p>

<p>At this point it would seem that congress, the judiciary and vast swaths of the American people are against Trump and you can hear the bells of 2018 on the horizon. Good luck, sir. Hey at least you have the business community on your side...</p>

<p>Member when Trump said he had a line of CEO&#39;s to replace the ones who want to leave and they should just leave and then they left and he just shut down the council because no one wanted to be on it. Cause I remember.</p>

<p>Just because I support Trump doesn&#39;t mean that your speculation is speculation. There is no interpretation there. </p>

<p>Anything Trump&#39;s family is receiving in profits from guests staying at their hotels is pittance in comparison to the donations of millions of $$$ from foreign political powers and groups to the Clinton Foundation.</p>

<p>No, because the polls are always wrong, and their sole purpose is to sway public opinion (into thinking Trump had no chance, foe example).</p>

<p>Not that those votes actually matter, at all.</p>

<p>What&#39;s silly about it? Exactly why the electoral college exists - to prevent 1 or 2 cities from having control over who gets elected. The POTUS represents all of America, not just New York and California. Do you realize how the election process actually works? It&#39;s not a popular vote contest.</p>

<p>I can tell you in confidence right now, Trump will remain president until 2020. I&#39;d rather have the business community on my side than communists, anarchists, radical feminists, etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How is the investigation into the Clinton&#39;s going? It&#39;s almost as if there is no investigation going on at all!</p>

<p>I know you think polls are always wrong, that&#39;s why I said I didn&#39;t want to discuss that. Because. We. Couldn&#39;t. Agree. On. The. Premise.</p>

<p>Interesting though that in Trump&#39;s mind all polls are fake except the one&#39;s that are favorable to him... like when he tweeted that Rasmussen poll showing him at 48 (HAHA) percent...</p>

<p>I wasn&#39;t talking about the validity of the electoral college. You posted a map of 2016 county results, I guess to show how popular Trump is... I was simply pointing out that that is a bad indicator of popularity because the red counties, while geographically larger, contain less people. I actually support the electoral college, which I acknowledge he legitimately won and thus he is the President.</p>

<p>I was being sarcastic about the business community supporting him. Hence the joke about all the CEO&#39;s leaving and him and having no one to replace them in T_D slang.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t bring up the economy because it was not directly related to what we were discussing... but since you brought it up, compare the job numbers of the last 24 months of the Obama administration to the last 6 months and you will find we are in the same economy. Why has the stock market continued to rise? Because that is what stocks do in bull markets... You are correct that he has not sent us into a tailspin.</p>

<p>But here is my larger point- I believe Trump committed an impeachable offense. You say I am &quot;speculating&quot; ... sure, I guess. Removing a President from office is not a criminal proceeding, it is a political event. The founding fathers wanted to make it EXTREMELY difficult to remove someone from office outside of their electorate voting them out... it couldn&#39;t be just the political tide that forced someone from office (outside of an election) it would have to be a hurricane. In the removal of a President, the House of Representatives is the grand jury and the Senate is the jury... as with grand juries, the house has broad leeway on what to indict someone on, that is why the language on impeachable offenses is relatively vague- it&#39;s intentionally vague. What I addressed could easily result in impeachment IF there was political will for it.</p>

<p>I argue there will be. You argue... something.</p>

<p>I can tell you in confidence that you don&#39;t know shit about what is going to happen in the next 3 years.</p>
