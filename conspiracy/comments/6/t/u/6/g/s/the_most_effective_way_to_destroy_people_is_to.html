You will also be called, but not limited to....a &quot;Nazi&quot;, a White Supremist, a Bigot, an Alt-Right extremist, a domestic terrorist.</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t believe there is a war on the history of America you would be sadly mistaken. Over the years the Left has demonized the constitution, the Gadsden Flag, the Bill of rights, the Founding Fathers. Future generations will not know the history of the US and therefore the many rights they have as citizens. They will be easily controlled and abused.</p>

<p>There is one statue of a Confederate General that will be allowed to stand...that of Albert Pike...because he was a Mason. Will the left get their panties in a wad over that one? We shall see if they go up against the Masons or not.</p>

Google wiping &quot;unconfirmed&quot; information, liberals convincing people laws promote racism, hatrid, etc.etc. history books are updated annually by publishers whom are among the richest of the rich (Thomson family in Canada and others).

    <div class="md"><p>It occurs to me that especially when we are talking about the elite (ie Black Nobility) they are obsessed with family and lineage connections. Where you come from is maybe more important than what you are.</p>

<p>We see the exact opposite being encouraged among the lower classes. We are being actively encouraged to abandon our anscestry, to destroy family. Maybe destroy is too strong a word, but look at divorce rates. Families are not sticking together like they used to. How many of you know who your great-great family members are, or even where you come from. I know my gramps on my dad&#39;s side came over from sweden, my mom&#39;s side I know nothing. Her family wasn&#39;t even interested in knowing, and she definitely came from a very poor background. But fact is, my entire knowledge of my ancestry dies 2 gens back.</p>

<p>Just adding that maybe this is being encouraged toward a general goal of erasing history as well. But why? Because it makes everyone feel alone and lost in space. Every man is an island. Part of the discouraging any kind of solidarity.</p>

<p>Do you think the lower classes are being encouraged to disconnect from their ancestry simply as economic manipulation? Inheritance of resources along familial lines is the primary mode of transmission of wealth across time. This is how the 1% stays the 1%.</p>

<p>Lower classes are encouraged to &quot;spend their kids&#39; inheritance&quot; or at least ensure that they aren&#39;t a &quot;burden&quot; to their kids in their old age. This is a total crock of shit. Kids are the original long-term care insurance, ffs. This is a profound shift - across time and cultures, kids have traditionally taken responsibility for their parents well being after they become infirm. I see the Boomer generation being when this shift happened.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I <em>knew</em> six of my great-grands personally, and have a photo with one of my great-greats holding me as an infant. I feel a strong connection with the past and have an active historical memory. I knew and spoke with people who lived before there was an income tax, for instance. It&#39;s easier to envision the alternative (<em>not</em> having an income tax) when you&#39;ve personally interacted with people who lived under those conditions.</p>

<p>I think the primary motivation for disconnecting people from their ancestry is economic, but it might be about killing inherited ideas too. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think there is power in extended family beyond the economic, but for sure economics are part of it. There is something of power in a nationalistic sentiment, the identification as part of a group. I am considering the family a small nation here. There is also the bargaining power of belonging to a group. </p>

<p>I can think of a lots of intangible things that would benefit from the existence of strong extended family structures. Having never lived in one though, I am sure one who has would have a better explanation of the benefits.</p>

Confederate statues aren&#39;t the only things being replaced. Western history in general is being rewritten, according to the BBC, medieval Europe was a multicultural society. And no, this isn&#39;t just for a movie or TV series, it&#39;s in videos they intend to be used for actual education. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s not pussyfoot around the issue, the perpetrators themselves don&#39;t deny it if you ask them, they cheer at the fact whites will be a minority in the U.S and Europe, they cheer at the destruction of our history and culture. People have a right to hold on to their culture, that&#39;s our humanity, and they are wiping it away before our very eyes. I usually cringe at the 1984 comparisons because they are way overblown and cliche, but this is the most real and scary Orwellian comparison there is. They won&#39;t stop until we blend all our cultures together into one unidentifiable fabricated mess, we&#39;ll have no ties to our history and from that point on, the elite can do whatever they damn well please. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well alright.  That was actually a refreshing answer.  Please explain more of this theory, it&#39;s a new one to me and I would legit love to hear a breakdown of it.  (Btw, according to my aunt&#39;s ancestry.com hobby, I can trace back to the 1700s on my paternal grandfather&#39;s mother&#39;s side.  That was when my Chisolm ancestor got into some shit over the Jacobites and presumably lost his land and records.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My point was that it&#39;s hypocritical to say that one&#39;s personal history is so important when these statues are of people that defended their right to rip others away from their history.  African culture and history was and still is heavily dependent on oral tradition, as it is with most who lived in a climate that did not have a lot of easy food sources available.  When people were stolen from their families and cultures, that oral tradition was lost to them and the world.  That&#39;s not their fault.</p>

<p>Furthermore, for black people in the US today, their personal history has become one that has started in the US, out of necessity.  That means that slavery is going to be more personal and touchy.  It also means that things like Black History Month are going to be more important, as it&#39;s a way for a culture to connect to a collective history that is still new and growing.  Do you feel the same protectiveness over the protection of history when talking about Black History month, or do you draw the line at history that happened to white people?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I&#39;m not white so let&#39;s just shut that down. I can&#39;t trace my history either because they don&#39;t keep great records in the ME, or they were destroyed during regime changes. Destruction of history is a popular thing in some places for good reason; the masses can&#39;t learn from the past.</p>

<p>You have no clue about history if you think the confederacy was all about slavery, ffs. Go to the history channel and look up stuff on Abe Lincoln. He wasn&#39;t an abolitionist.</p>

<p>How can ancestry be important when the family unit is not? How many Maury Povich shows do you need to see where it is proven that this guy is not the father before you realize that oral tradition of passing down information it so error prone and unproductive that it is ignorant to argue it&#39;s importance. </p>

<p>Black history month is a crock, why isn&#39;t everything incorporated? Why is segregation still so important in the US? Why are people still defined by the color of the skin instead of the content of their character? </p>

<p>Why is EVERYTHING brought back to race/ethnicity? Because TPTB prefer infighting, and these divides have proven most useful, period. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My apologies for my assumption.  Also, that&#39;s sincerely sad that you can&#39;t have access to the same kind of records that I am privileged enough to have.  The Middle East&#39;s history is an especially sad one to lose, given that its the cradle of civilization.</p>

<p>I am aware that the Civil War was not fully about slavery.  However, it did involve slavery and the impact of it emotionally on the country has been massive.  It&#39;s an unavoidable part of the conflict that has to be brought up when we talk about the Confederacy.  It&#39;s too fraught to ignore.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The only reason we make assumptions based on race is because every study, statistic, standard is broken down into race. Race disparity was conceptualized by Darwin. The fact that we keep making it historically significant furthers the divide - it does not to mend it.</p>

<p>Content of character and most qualified for a task are what we should focus on, but we don&#39;t. </p>

<p>How exactly do you logic your way through the racial disparities in professional sports? </p>

<p>I do make assumptions based on appearance. My mother may have taught me to not judge a book by it&#39;s cover (which I rarely assume content), but I counter with what would make me pick up a book in the first place? Color of skin aside - the way people present themselves is important, period. Wearing pants sagging around your ass, showing your underwear merits judgement regardless of race. You&#39;ve chosen to appear a certain way because you desire to be viewed a certain way. </p>

<p>If I want to be viewed as a professional - I look the part. I want the doctor performing surgery walking in dressed well or in appropriate attire for the job, not in leathers looking like he just split off from his biker gang. </p>

<p>Please tell me, what happens when a person of color walks into a black establishment wearing loafers, a polo and khakis, while speaking eloquently?</p>

<p>Biases exist, but to keep beating people over the head with why the biases exist while yelling to end the bias is counterproductive not to mention counterintuitive. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I disagree with the idea that the concept of race was conceptualized by Darwin.  He wasn&#39;t a social darwinist.  Anyway, I dont think that people needed a reason to find ways to be divisive, we&#39;re really good at it.  Whether we judge people by race, religion, class, sect or class, humans have always found a way to view someone as less human than them.  It just so happens that race is an easy way to do this because that person looks different.</p>

<p>As for race and sports, let me preface this by saying that I&#39;m a hockey fan so that&#39;s where my mind automatically goes.  Hockey is a sport with incredible classism issues because of the costly nature of it.  You don&#39;t see many black athletes in it, though the number is rising, because of price both in the fact that you arent likely to get a large scholarship to play it and because of the large upfront costs to play.  Anyway, there are some black people with an evolutionary quirk that happens to allow them to oxygenate their blood better.  That would allow them to be better athletes.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t aim to divide people and I do feel passionately about trying to improve the world for others.  The way that I feel is the best way to do that is to bring things out into the open where they can be looked at, studied and dealt with.  I say that because I have had and likely will continue to have racist thoughts.  The way Ive dealt with them best is to look at them and deal with it instead of denying it and I believe that this kind of introspection is an important part of being a good human.</p>

<p>As far as fashion, I&#39;ve known black people who sag their pants and white people who sag their pants.  In general, what those people had in common was a shared culture where that was seen as a good look and commonly, issues with classism and access to clothes that connotate a higher class to most people.  That&#39;s all variable though and you&#39;ll get different reactions in different places.  Classism is a son of a bitch.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Read <a href="http://www.bartleby.com/124/pres31.html">Lincoln&#39;s inaugural speech </a>
Morally, Lincoln did the right thing, but he didn&#39;t do it simply because he was so noble. He did it for political reasons, and he did so after he said he never would multiple times.</p>

<p>Democrats in the south were concerned about state&#39;s rights, about their economy and about the fact they had lost the Whitehouse. They weren&#39;t as concerned about state&#39;s rights when a Democrat was in office. They just didn&#39;t want a Republican telling them what they could and couldn&#39;t do. Despite the fact that Lincoln never said he would free slaves, and he was not an abolitionist. </p>

<p>When Lincoln tried to reinforce a federal military post in the South, the Confederates didn&#39;t take too kindly to what they perceived to be an aggressive act. The Civil War is referred to as the War of Northern Aggression because that is exactly how it was viewed.</p>

<p>To say a war was fought over a single issue (slavery) is either ignorant or obtuse. Lincoln only ended slavery as a final blow to cripple the Confederacy for their actions against the Union. </p>

<p>When Southern Democrats gave up their seats in the federal government by choosing to secede this allowed Republicans to pass: 
The Homestead Act, which was a blow to slave owners. 
New tariffs, the South wanted free trade.
The Revenue Act to pay for the war, but the first of many versions of income taxes
Transcontinental Railroad legislation 
National Banking</p>

<p>All these things were seen as overreaches by Democrats from the South, but they lost influence in federal government because of population growth in the industrialized North. So the South decided they wanted out of the Union because they knew they were going to be outvoted and the federal government was no longer going to be looking out for the South&#39;s best interests. </p>

<p>It all sounds very familiar. Because history has been augmented to make people believe certain conflicts revolved around a single issue. Looking through a different lens, it becomes easy to understand why history is so often repeated. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;sure they were sold into slavery, no big deal&quot; lol. then they worked here, were housed and eventually freed. Probably freed by some of the people who&#39;s statues you are arguing to tear down. Some people are evil and treated their slaves poorly, also some bosses are evil and treat their workers poorly today. Isn&#39;t it interesting that the American slaves did well enough to have children and produce enough offspring to have a major population in America today? Some other countries castrate their slaves, and/or treat them so poorly that they cannot produce a population. Some of these countries still have slaves today. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It doesn&#39;t I really never cared about it and why would I? Ive also know white people that were adopted and didn&#39;t know their family history. Felt more sorry the fact they were adopted not because of a missing family history. Who cares? Seems more like you are seeking reasons to pitty black people. The negative association we keep bringing up is that all black people&#39;s history is only slavery. Which is completely wrong. Just as many white people have been slaves as blacks. Slave and master society didn&#39;t just appear because white people found black people. Mostly Id just stop falling for the white guilt narrative and stop pitting people that are entirely capable individuals. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You may not care about and that is fine.  However, some people do care about that and I have empathy for what they feel is a loss to them.  Some black people dont care about the loss, which is fine.  Some black people feel that loss deeply, which is also fine.  As I don&#39;t have the same life experiences to them, I&#39;m willing to accede to their viewpoint and understand that some things will be hurtful to thwm that are not to me, and vice versa.  If this is white guilt, then so be it.  I prefer to think of it as treating people as I would like to be treated.</p>

Some people lose everything, it sucks but you got to stop living in the past and get over it. It was bad for those slaves, but it&#39;s over. Time to pick up the pieces and move on. focusing on past emotional injuries is a distinction in psychology. Finally the people who were rounding up the slaves were just as guilty as the white slave buyers. The slavery market existed before the whites became customers.

Finally I was trampled when I suggested things like legalizing MJ and climate change being adopted by states was not a threat to the federal governments authoritarian power.

<p>Did you know the confederacy put a rule in place saying that even if a confederate state banned slavery, they would still have to follow the overall rule saying runaway slaves from other states had to be returned.</p>

<p>There were no more states rights in the confederacy, there was just slavery.</p>

<p>Also how is removing statues that were put in in the past 100 years to fight back against civil rights for minorities destroying history? Are museums and history books being burned?</p>

<p>I think what more people will realize is that erecting participation trophies to losing traitors wasn&#39;t a great idea. Especially since men like Lee hated the idea and wanted the confederacy stricken from everything.</p>

<p>&quot;So insistent was Lee on extinguishing the fiery passions of the Civil War that he opposed erecting monuments on the war’s battlefields. “I think it wiser moreover not to keep open the sores of war, but to follow the examples of those nations who endeavored to obliterate the marks of civil strife and to commit to oblivion the feelings it engendered,” he wrote.</p>

<p>Rather than raising battlefield memorials, he favored erasing battlefields from the landscape altogether, according to documents at the University of Virginia and the Library of Congress.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is really fascinating when you think about it though.  These are monuments built celebrating the lives of the losers in a civil war.  They were built in a time where there were few direct participants of that civil war remaining and the most recent military action meant that most had been actively fighting for America in WWI.  I can&#39;t think of a similar situation existing anywhere else or any other historical time where a regional hero would have a statue in a nation that would consider them to be a traitor but at the same time the locals just finished fighting a major war side by side with the rest of the nation.  That&#39;s what makes these statues unique and historical.  How they affect our lives today is unclear to me.</p>

<p>If I thought that bringing down the statues would help in any way bring the country together and fix our racial issues then I would certainly be all for it.  I actually think it does quite the opposite and sacrifices a bit of fascinating history in the process.  The side that wants to take them down can find endless pieces of history to be outraged about.  There are thousands of plantation houses, old slave ports, old forts, and other reminders of the civil war and slavery.  I&#39;d just prefer to move with extreme caution when it comes to destroying historical artifacts as a response to the insatiable thirst to right the wrongs of a bygone era.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I actually have read them. My perception of what they say obviously differs from yours. Ultimately owning slaves was a right the south did not want to lose. It was akin to economic catastrophe to the south. The right to own slaves was what they fought for. The states that agreed to return slaves were also partially dependent on the economic return slaves provided to the confederacy so it was in their interest to fight for it as well even though they didn&#39;t necessarily support slavery. It was the end of the south&#39;s way of life. They were willing to secede to preserve their wealth. The Federal government was willing to fight to preserve the union and hold on to valuable real estate. The point being, history regardless of how much we disagree with it is still history. It needs to be learned from. The fact that you believe that the civil war was fought over something noble like &quot;freeing slaves&quot;  proves this. It was all economics. Finally to quote a great song, &quot;they don&#39;t burn the books they just remove them...&quot; Rage Against the Machine. </p>

<p>Again. Since when are books the same as statues erected to piss off uppity minorities fighting for equal rights?</p>

<p>What a crock of shit. It&#39;s hilarious how people like you scoff when southern states claim the statues were erected as Historical monuments to the regions history...which is exactly WHY they were put up. To think they, the southern states, went through all that trouble just to be a pain in the ass to blacks is off the charts laughable.</p>

<p>The leftists will think up any outrageous lie that ignorant people will believe in order to tear down the historical statues that fly in the face of THEIR political beliefs...and THAT is as un-American as you can get. The left is desperately trying to erase American history so they can pervert the minds of the next generations.</p>

<p>What exactly was separate but equal? If not a whole lot of trouble to duplicate things and spend money just to be  a pain in the ass for blacks?</p>

<p>&quot;South Carolina didn’t hoist the battle flag in Columbia until 1961—the anniversary of the war’s start, but also the middle of the civil-rights push, and a time when many white Southerners were on the defensive about issues like segregation and voting rights.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A timeline of the genesis of the Confederate sites shows two notable spikes. One comes around the turn of the 20th century, just after Plessy v. Ferguson, and just as many Southern states were establishing repressive race laws. The second runs from the mid-1950s to the mid-1960s—the peak of the civil-rights movement. In other words, the erection of Confederate monuments has been a way to perform cultural resistance to black equality.&quot;</p>

<p>I&#39;d be worried about the pussy grabbing president that raped at least one wife, cheated on all 3 and walks in on underage girls at his pageants while they change. But maybe we&#39;ve got a different definition of perverted?</p>

<p>Why does the south need these participation trophies for traitors so badly?</p>

<p>&quot; It&#39;s the concept and it&#39;s a continuation of the Orwellian direction OP referenced, which is not desirable.&quot;</p>

<p>What about Lee&#39;s own thoughts on the matter?</p>

<p>&quot;So insistent was Lee on extinguishing the fiery passions of the Civil War that he opposed erecting monuments on the war’s battlefields. “I think it wiser moreover not to keep open the sores of war, but to follow the examples of those nations who endeavored to obliterate the marks of civil strife and to commit to oblivion the feelings it engendered,” he wrote.</p>

<p>Rather than raising battlefield memorials, he favored erasing battlefields from the landscape altogether, according to documents at the University of Virginia and the Library of Congress.&quot;</p>

<p>he employed the most notoriously vicious plantation forman of his era.</p>

<p>he was central to the fight for 3/5 clause.</p>

<p>he was terrified of his slaves and slaves in general and supported sending freed ones to back to africa to prevent them from revolting.</p>

<p>even though he had no heirs, like washington, he refused to free his slaves at his death, unlike washington.</p>

<p>the core belief founding american idenity we owe to his eloquence excluded blacks, slaves, women, and unpropertied white men...and this indiputable based on his ketters to abigail adams. who knows, franklin editted the declaration changing pursuit of property to pusuit of happiness, maybe he also stuck through &quot;rich white&quot; between all and equal.</p>

While you see the Robert E Lee statue as a war hero, others see the statue as a constant reminder of the persecution and brutality their ancestors were subjected to.

One was a monument to the German soldiers who died in the First World War put there in the 1930s by the Nazi Government at the time. In the 60s and 70s there was disagreement about what was to be done with the monument - many wanted to get rid of it but then again it was a monument to war dead. In the end a companion monument was constructed to the atrocities of war. History is a complex beast. Bad things happened. People did bad things. As a former educator I don&#39;t believe in sugar coating and covering things up. Use these confederate monuments as teaching moments and create companion pieces or plagues to fully explain.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The entire history of the confederacy was rewritten by the daughters of the confederacy in an attempt to paint the lost cause as a noble fight for states rights and not a defense of slavery, which it was. Read the Cornerstone speech, or the various state constitutions, or the Confederate Constitution, or the Declaration of Secession from South Carolina, and slavery is repeatedly mentioned as the foremost or only cause for secession and formation of the Confederacy.</p>

<p>Yet today, thanks to a whitewashing of history, it is often taught as &quot;states rights&quot; even though the Confederacy explicitly banned any state from abolishing slavery.</p>

When people were stolen from their families and cultures, that oral tradition was lost to them and the world.  That&#39;s not their fault.</p>

<p>Furthermore, for black people in the US today, their personal history has become one that has started in the US, out of necessity.  That means that slavery is going to be more personal and touchy.  It also means that things like Black History Month are going to be more important, as it&#39;s a way for a culture to connect to a collective history that is still new and growing.  Do you feel the same protectiveness over the protection of history when talking about Black History month, or do you draw the line at history that happened to white people?</p>

<p>If you have enough money, you can buy whatever identity you&#39;d like from the government.</p>

<p>you now there intense govt ID and background checking on legal immigrants form first/second world countries than people from third world countries whose govts have shit records.</p>

<p>and of course &#39;illegals&#39; if they are not honest migrants would have even worse legit paperwork and history.</p>

<p>bureaucrats tend to do everything as the paperwork allows, give them a 8x11 and they will count the letters.</p>

<p>they are victims of their own system. they then inflict their travesties onto peoples.</p>
