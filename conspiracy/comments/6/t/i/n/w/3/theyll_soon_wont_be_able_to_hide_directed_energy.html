        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Maybe this will go unnoticed due to all the right wing attack, Nazi vs true American and so forth, but what happened in Cuba was never even remotely explained or clarified. </p>

<p>Seems like if people is using directed energy weapons (this includes the supposed ultra-sonic weapons) against other HUMAN BEINGS, causing physical and psychological harm, is not much of a deal. Seems like it&#39;s more of a joke and funny or mostly avoided, even on a conspiracy subreddit. Reminds some people of the Soviet microwave attack on the US embassy, that is mostly discredited because the non-ionizing energy from microwaves &quot;don&#39;t cause cancer&quot;, instead of finding sources about directed energy weapons biological and neurological effects. Interesting, isn&#39;t it?</p>

<p>Now seems like Cuba have developed through-wall ultra-sonic weapons (It might not even be what it&#39;s claimed to be, as ultra-sonic devices don&#39;t go well with walls), this is one of the most insane statements I seen, a technologically under-developed country is using high-tech weapons to attack diplomats from the most technologically advanced country in the world, that also invest $580.3 BILLIONS on it&#39;s army. This is an obvious attempt to pass a statements that is implicit for both parties or something else, but the relevant part is that people will remain ignorant on the assaults that can be done not only to harm US officials but target <strong>ANY civilian</strong>, and I can assure you, these aren&#39;t new weapons <strong>nor these officials were the first targets</strong>.</p>

<p>A decade later, an overview of radiation impacts on human perceptions cited investigations at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research that demonstrated &#39;receiverless&#39; wireless voice transmission via microwaves. However the radiation levels approached the (then current) 10mW/cm² limit of safe exposure.[7]</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The sub needs more of this.  </p>

<p>Hillary Clinton reportedly had very, very secret technological information on her server, which was hacked by at least three nations.</p>

<p>The Awans had access to some of our highest secrets.</p>

<p>China, Israel, Iran, Russia, etc have been hacking our defense undustries for well over a decade now.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not beyond belief that either Cuba got their hands on some of this technology, a third party state gave it to them, or maybe Cuba was being used for its field application and didn&#39;t even know it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, lets think for a minute that maybe Cubans got it, that means the information about such weaponry might be more distributed than we thought. Cuba, Russia and even the US might have defectors or officials involved with criminal organizations, mafia, extremist groups and so forth (hackers already own CIA and NSA most advanced exploits and are suspected to be part of cyber criminal groups, literally thefts).</p>

<p>This might open the door for covert actions from criminals against the average Joe that would be treated as mentally ill, or that those actions have been happening and undisclosed. Is this possible?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well it really isn&#39;t hard to make a microwave gun.. And that goes through(most) walls with a range of 50-100m achievable with a relatively small dish. Plenty of people have made prototypes showing how to do it on YouTube. I have the technical knowledge to cook a whole house full of people from the inside out, with no sound or evidence and for under $100. If I know how to do that and on such a small budget..

<p>A gun is directing the energy of an explosion to propel a piece of metal. </p>

<p>A bomb is directing energy from an explosion to decimate all in its radius. </p>

<p>Shit even a water canon is directing pressure energy by pushing water at targets. </p>

<p>I am not arguing against your info, I am just not sure what you are supposed to mean by &quot;directed energy weapons&quot;? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You might be partially right, but the shared definition is a focused beam that harms through it&#39;s own radiation and not from shrapnel, bullets fire and so (and the rest of main or colateral damage from conventional weapons):</p>

<p>From Wiki:
&quot;A directed-energy weapon (DEW) emits highly focused energy, transferring that energy to a target to damage it.
Potential applications of this technology include anti-personnel weapon systems, missile defense system, and the disabling of lightly armored vehicles or devices&quot;</p>
