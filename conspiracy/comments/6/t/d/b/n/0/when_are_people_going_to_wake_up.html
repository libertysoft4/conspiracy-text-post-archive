2017: White supremacy group organizes in Virginia (everyone flips shit, acts like they didn&#39;t exist before the current admin). 1 dead, 9 injured.</p>

<p>When are people going to realize how much of a tool they are to the true oppression? This is getting absurd, and it&#39;s exactly what they want. Organized hate and strife on American soil, manipulating the populous through the media and building the perfect system for the control of millions. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know. </p>

<p>Klan rallies and WS marches have gone on for YEARS, there was probably a dozen more going on at the same time in different areas of the country, mostly south and Bible belt areas.</p>

<p>But <em>this</em> one...Something was real special about this one.</p>

<p>Folks are so busy screaming hate at each other they&#39;re missing what&#39;s going on. Twitter and FB and other SM have gotten them SO worked up they have gone completely fucking bonkers about it, both sides.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like some mass social experiment and I&#39;m on the outside, studying it or something. Thankfully there are a lot of other folks who feel this way too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m expecting more &quot;rallies&quot; with escalating violence, more deaths, more awful photos bombarding the news/social media, more outrage against Trump, celebrities suddenly showing up at said rallies/choosing sides, increased violence against police and first responders, and the National Guard/Homeland Security becoming a fixture in every major city in the US.</p>

<p>That&#39;s what I&#39;m expecting to happen within the next year or so...Will be interesting to see what happens. </p>

<p>People need to put their phones down and come up for air. Examine why they&#39;re allowing other people&#39;s opinions and literal fake news to trigger them into rage/stress. </p>

<p>I guess I feel on the outside because I refuse to let this &quot;thing&quot; have any say so on how I feel, lol. </p>

<p>Doesn&#39;t mean I don&#39;t care or have empathy for those who&#39;ve been killed or hurt, quite the opposite actually. I&#39;m a nurse so I&#39;m very empathetic in general. People losing their life over what are essentially opinions is probably one of the saddest and most tragic things one could lose their life over. </p>

<p>&quot;Perhaps we need some outside universal threat to make us recognize this common bond. <strong>I occasionally think how quickly our differences worldwide would vanish if we were facing an alien threat from outside this world</strong>.” -Ronald Regan </p>

<p>Not aliens but with continued division and rage, an invasion from another country wouldn&#39;t only be possible but doable. While we&#39;re fighting each other someone else decides it&#39;s time to finally invade the US...Would we come together to fight a common enemy, or?</p>

<p>Live and let live. </p>
