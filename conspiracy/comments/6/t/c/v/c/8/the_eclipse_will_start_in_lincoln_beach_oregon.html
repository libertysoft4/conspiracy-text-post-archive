<p>Is this why they always push the number 33 on us all the time worldwide?</p>

<p>He said: “The moon involved is called a black moon. These occur about every 33 months. In the Bible, the divine name of Elohim appears 33 times in Genesis.</p>

<p>The eclipse will start in Lincoln Beach, Oregon - the 33rd state - and end on the 33rd degree of Charleston, South Carolina.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Notable eclipses of the 20th century[edit]
29 May 1919: this total eclipse was photographed by Arthur Eddington to verify general relativity[2]
20 June 1955: longest total eclipse between 1901 and 2000, lasting a maximum of 7 minutes and 8 seconds[3]
30 June 1973: a Concorde jet flew along the path, thereby extending the length of totality to 74 min.[4]
29 March 1987: second hybrid eclipse in less than one year, the first being on 1986 October 3.
31 July 2000: the second solar eclipse within one calendar month, the first being on 2000 July 1.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>hmm, maybe you mean that in 1918 there was a total eclipse that cut across the country from Oregon to southeast.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A total solar eclipse occurred on June 8, 1918. The eclipse was observed by a U.S. Naval Observatory team at Baker City in Oregon. The painting below shows totality when the Moon prevented the Sun&#39;s rays from hitting that part of Oregon. The track of the eclipse was a band across the entire contiguous United States.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is not my opinion, I&#39;m just quoted the &quot;numerologist&quot; in the article. </p>

<p>I personally find it odd how often the number 33 is pushed by the media and our government, like NASA is about to test sonic booms around eclipse time. </p>

<p>You know how many sonic booms NASA plans?</p>

<p>33</p>

<p>Seriously</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nasa.gov/centers/armstrong/features/sonic_boom_tests_set_for_ksc.html">https://www.nasa.gov/centers/armstrong/features/sonic_boom_tests_set_for_ksc.html</a></p>

<p>&quot;NASA is expecting to fly the F-18 two-to-three times per day, starting Monday, Aug. 21 and will conclude the end of the month or early September, focusing on collecting data on a targeted minimum of 33 sonic booms.&quot;</p>

<p>Always 33</p>

    <div class="md"><p>33 is the largest positive integer that cannot be written as the sum of distinct triangular numbers. Triangular numbers are a tiling- / stacking-based sequence. I think this may be partially related to the whole pyramid / occult math and numerology thing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The result is provable with induction, not a totally simple proof but not very hard. </p>

<p>As for a conclusive proof of its Hermetic significance, I&#39;m no expert on that. All I mean is that if you look at pyramids and various stacking problems, you&#39;re basically stacking polygons (assuming some regular stacking) which are composed of triangular numbers. All polygonal numbers can be obtained from triangular numbers via formula. </p>

<p>My guess would be that the handful of numbers up to 33 (and none greater) which cannot be expressed as distinct sums of triangular numbers would therefore need to be represented more explicitly in the tiling design. Numbers  greater than 33 are implicitly represented as sums of tiles. This would be under the hypothesis that the pyramids are storehouses of ancient knowledge a la Shakespeare Equation. </p>

<p>So I can&#39;t go check the pyramids myself, but my guess is in important rooms/chambers we&#39;d find tilings that highlight important occult/hermetic/scientific numbers. My theory is that at least some of those numbers would be the ones unexpressable as distinct sums of triangular numbers. I know 11 and 22 are also occult numbers, but you can express these as triangular sums, so it&#39;s not some conclusive theory I&#39;ve got. But hey, I don&#39;t think we&#39;ll get the full story any time soon. </p>

<p>I think the triangular number thing also has something to do with why you hear occult/numerological people say that 11,22, and 33 are important &quot;master numbers&quot; but do not include other higher multiples of 11 like 44 and 55, etc.. </p>

<p>Weird to think about nothing conclusive. </p>

<p>The reply above about how he&#39;s certain it&#39;s the proportion of fallen angels seems a little too sure and simplistic, given Gnosticism/Hermeticism appears to pre-date even the old testament by a lot longer than we&#39;re told. </p>

<p>The whole spinal cord having 33 vertebrae interests me because I just discovered that many people believe the story of Jacob&#39;s Ladder (in the Bible) is really about the spinal cord (looks like a ladder) going up to the pineal gland. Just makes me think.  :-)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, we tried to watch a film about Jacob and Esau, but one was in French and the other is a 90&#39;s tv movie not yet available online....at least not on Amazon or Netflix.</p>

<p>It&#39;s an interesting story. I&#39;ll have to read about the ladder, it was mentioned and depicted by a drawing in wikipedia article, but I had a garage wall to build and Sunday is &quot;go for milk on the motorcycle before it gets dark&quot; day.</p>

<p>Peace. Thanks. </p>
