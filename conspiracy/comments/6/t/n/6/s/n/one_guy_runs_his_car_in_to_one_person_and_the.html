They want everyone pissed off and emotional, and taking a side. They want you to think this matters, far far more than the thousands of other people who died this month. </p>

<p>But it only matters because it&#39;s being given so much attention. The shock value of this story is off the charts, and the media are stirring the pot as much as possible. The military-industrial complex wants us on the edge of war so they can sell more arms, and lead us more easily in to profitable large-scale wars. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t give in. The world hasn&#39;t changed. Just the media&#39;s portrayal of it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. If they break the law, they go to jail like anyone else. Other than that, they should be ignored like the morons they are. End of story. </p>

<p>The sensationalizing is definitely propaganda to divide and conquer, and bring us closer to war to put the ball in the MIC&#39;s court. Probably helps the news&#39; ratings too. </p>

<p>What is lost is balance and perspective, and instead we have a populace being riled up and being made more hateful and divided than ever. </p>

<p>And I think the shills on all the internet forums make this look more organic than it is (people look divided much more than they actually are). A lot of people are being swept in to pre-made opinion-boxes right now because they&#39;re too emotional to think clearly</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Spot on.  I just hope people are aware of George Soros funding divide &amp; conquer techniques such as the pink and color revolutions.  Reminds me of that <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2015/02/26/us/blue-black-white-gold-dress/index.html">stupid blue dress thing</a> the media did a few years ago.  Also hope people know about the history of Operation Gladio and the Strategy of Tension used in Italy.</p>

<p>People were already ramped up with the media&#39;s hyping of the North Korea threat.  Now this Nazi shit.</p>

<p>One good thing is I think their tactics aren&#39;t working.  People aren&#39;t responding to the black lives matter campaigns, Kony 2012, etc like they want them too, so they have to go in more and more absurd directions and methods.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think we&#39;re going to start seeing a cycle here. A week of domestic nazi shit, followed by a week of NK nuke shit, then a week of Syria/Iran shit. Those 3 will be hit over and over and over, until one of them turns in to an actual war. I think that&#39;s the MIC media strategy now. </p>

<p>I also think people have just about had enough of the media&#39;s BS. The only problem is most people now use the internet, and a lot of people don&#39;t realize how inorganic the votes and comments are on sites like reddit. If people can recognize this propaganda as well, then I&#39;d say we&#39;ll do alright. But it&#39;s hard to tell how quickly people are waking up to this particular fact. </p>

<p>At what point though does this end? If this is all just some Soros vs Koch pissing match, then can&#39;t they just keep making it more and more and more absurd? I hope someday soon there is justice, and humanity can control itself rather than billionaires pulling so many of the media strings that shape our culture. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>When there &quot;attack&quot; like this everyone knows that you don&#39;t give them any attention.</p>

<p>Instead all of reddit is doing the exact opposite and sensationalizing it as if all those guys were full fledged neo nazis armed to their teeth ready to kill.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t they think the outcome would of been a lot different had that been the case? </p>

<p>Neo Nazis have been irrelevant for years now, the only power they had was in the prison system and yet suddenly everyone is treating them like they are this force to be reckoned with.</p>

<p>Sorry but they are still just mostly ignorant hill billys like the driver these blue collar groups are nothing to be afraid of. The worst thing we can do is keep giving them attention and feeding into their hate because that will be what results in them getting bigger and stronger.</p>

(2) His car had damage on the back before he hit any protesetors
(3) Video shows a protestor hitting the car with a flag before he hit any protestors</p>

<p>A plausible explanation is that he turned down the wrong street, saw all the protestors and hit the brakes. As we continued, he was attacked by the protestors with bats and flags. He tries to escape by going forward through the crowd, only to run into vehicles stopped in front of him. Once he stops, several protestors rush up with baseball bats and begin breaking his windows; he clearly should have feared for his life at that point. He reverses to get out of there before he was dragged out and inevitably killed. </p>

<p>Seems pretty plausible to me. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Replacement part, yes because they exist. Brake light, yes because it lights up when the brakes are used.</p>

<p>This doesn&#39;t explain why on any other Challenger the middle two lights (by the license plate) also light up when the brakes are activated <em>except</em> in your magical example. So again, maybe try and debunk those two inner lights by the license plate... I&#39;ll wait.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think we should look at everything. Leave no stone unturned. What is more offensive than the crime is if the crime were pre-planned and part of a larger issue. Otherwise, this is just a case of road rage gone horribly wrong. Charge the kid with the full extent of the law, and give the police a slap on the wrist for doing such a piss-poor job at making sure people were safe. This is getting ridiculous - we have people die for much darker reasons every single day. That crowd was not &#39;peaceful&#39;, and when fear is added into the equation, bad things happen when people panic. Turning the whole thing into a Nazis vs the rest of us is not a genuine representation of what happened.</p>

<p>Also, why hasn&#39;t the maroon vehicle which also plowed into a bunch of people been mentioned at all? This wasn&#39;t even a one-off incident - the drone video of the mob shows the maroon car also hitting the crowd far before the Challenger joined the fray. The whole thing is strange, even before you add in the helicopter crash for no reason and the strange attention the rally received in terms of Police stand-down, national guard involvement (for a 1000 person rally), and all the strange personalities involved.</p>

<p>The drone footage doesn&#39;t show that it was a chain reaction that started with the Challenger. There are several other videos that show the white car hit by the Challenger and then rear-ending the van.</p>

<p>I agree.</p>

<p>But to be clear the original commenter I was arguing with was trying to claim a flat out lie, and while questioning everything is important, accepting proven facts should happen in tandem with that — research, verify, update opinion as new facts are made clear.</p>

<p>I&#39;m open to being wrong, and I appreciate when someone points it out in a constructive way. That currently isn&#39;t happening in most of these threads and people are pushing seriously misleading information and insisting biased conjecture as proof/truth.</p>

What is missing from that image is what the car looks like without running lights turned on.  None of the bulbs would be illuminated.

Compare the right hand side of each image in the top row.  This is &quot;stock running lights&quot; compared with &quot;stock brake lights&quot;.

    <div class="md"><p>No.  IN the top row, the passenger side lights described as &quot;stock&quot; are being compared to an aftermarket replacement part called &quot;Stage 1&quot;.  The top row compares this product to the stock running lights and the stock brake lights.
The bottom row is comparing another product called &quot;Stage 2&quot; to the stock lights.  This is why the top left and lower left &quot;stock&quot; (passenger side) lights are the same.

    <div class="md"><p>so why did the maroon car slam into the crowd as well? </p>

<p>Why did the police back down and allow things to get completely out of control? Why was the national guard called out for a 1000 person rally (very small)? Why were government actors the first to respond? Why did a helicopter seem to crash for no reason at all?</p>

<p>There are plenty of questions to ask about this event. The fact alone that he apparently drove off and waited to turn himself in a few blocks away totally matches the hat you are putting on the guy (hateful racist Nazi zombie). There are clear signs of aggression towards his car before and after the hit. Could he possibly just be a kid who doesn&#39;t know how to drive well who panicked? And if so, how irresponsible is all of this political pandering to anti-Nazi sentiment (very easy target, nobody likes nazis). </p>

<p>it&#39;s all a little much to swallow, yet here you are handing out horse pills. Why can&#39;t we just wait to see what comes from it instead of being super sure that everyone else is wrong like you are doing?</p>

<p>It shouldnt matter what &#39;side&#39; the guy was on. It happened and the reasons why are far more important than political affiliations. </p>

<p>Where i live (over the atlantic), the left and right are a lot more center leaning. The extreme right is essentially the church (which is laughed at now) and the extreme left are very small in number. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>First of all, as someone who doesn&#39;t live in the USA and doesn&#39;t support either Political party. What was the point of the White Supremacists protest? What are they protesting exactly? Second of all, waving swastika flags, doing the Nazi salute. It&#39;s 2017. THIS SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN HAPPENING. Those who support the Right and are level-headed should also be against these people. The US FOUGHT against the Nazis in WW!!. There&#39;s no room for them in this day and age and anyone who supports that is vile. Now, on the other side. If these people wanted to protest, then let them protest. Who were they harming? If they want to be so deluded into thinking that there&#39;s an oppression against White America at the time, then let them protest. The people supporting the Left that decided to go and march against them at the protest are the vital reason all hell broke loose. I&#39;ve seen so many Leftists say all White Supremacists should die and deserve to die. Who are YOU to judge that? Isn&#39;t that what Hitler did? He believed an entire race should be exterminated? It really is no different than how Nazis think. Yet, we applaud the latter. Stop being pressured and brainwashed into thinking one event describes an entire group of people. The minorities are the first to want to drop stereotypes and discrimination but they are also the FIRST to place these stereotypes and discriminate. You don&#39;t fight inequality with inequality and you don&#39;t fight against violence with violence. Because when you do, it&#39;s a never-ending cycle that gets us NOWHERE. Regardless of which political side you support, CONDEMN violence. CONDEMN hate speech. CONDEMN racism, sexism, homophobia where it applies. CONDEMN inequality.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep.. It&#39;s insane, the level of retaliation. I even resorted to checking out /pol/ to see if they had any undiluted speculation in the realm of conspiracy, and nope, almost every other post was what I assume to be shills, shaming 4channers, rubbing this in their faces, saying things like &quot;we tried to warn you and now you&#39;re Nazis to all of America&quot;, just weird stuff. I hadn&#39;t ever had a reason to go to that board, so I don&#39;t know if all that division has always been there, or if its the same as how we have been infested with here, but shit&#39;s so crazy.. </p>

<p>Personally, I think that they&#39;re super desperate on this plan being as damaging to their opponents as possible, because maybe they are afraid of the message that a group of white people might bring to the stage of identity politics if allowed to do so? I dunno, but they&#39;re hitting this so hard for a reason, and I think that maybe it&#39;s that there are too many easy arguments to make against the way that this happened, the way it&#39;s being handled, the story involved, the knee-jerk reactions, the obvious crisis actors, the ties to the deep state of prominent and viral witnesses.. it&#39;s too absurd, as you said, and there are too many new instances of strange happenings, so they&#39;re sticking to their &quot;EVERYONE THAT DISAGREES IS A NAZI AND THE WHOLE WORLD THINKS SO&quot;, shaming the world, hoping this sticks. </p>

<p>And, the shaming probably will make this stick in the end, or at least it will be accepted as the official version of events without too much rebellion, but the small solace that I take is that nothing is truly free, and there is a cost to each of these plans which they have to foist on people, each death that is caused by their subversions and manipulations, and that cost is most dear to someone who lives completely in the dark: illumination. They have to reveal a bit of themselves each time they do things like this, and their power lies in remaining hidden at all costs. </p>

<p>I dunno I&#39;m rambling, still sorting this stuff out, personally. Thanks again though, and stay strong! :D</p>

<p>We&#39;re talking about a specific event that was carried out by someone who had just participated in a Nazi (or Nazi-like, if you prefer) rally. Just because other people kill people doesn&#39;t detract from the seriousness of this event, and the fact that it is related to Nazi symbolism. I don&#39;t see people ever saying something like that when it&#39;s a terror attack attributed to a muslim person, so it makes it difficult to see statements like these as anything other than trying to downplay this event and the relation to Nazis (or those pushing Nazi-like ideologies).</p>

<p>Um, I don&#39;t disagree if we&#39;re talking about a positive spotlight. However, by shining a light on the negative things these groups do and calling them out for their bigotry and violence is the only way to educate people so that they <em>don&#39;t</em> feel like they need to defend something (unless that&#39;s what they actually believe in I guess).</p>

<p>They need to be held accountable for their actions, and if their actions were encouraged and fostered because of some group and their ideologies (that the perpetrator takes part in or aligns themselves with) then people should be made aware of that. It&#39;s no different from pointing out a muslim terrorist was a member of ISIS or some other group pushing Jihad and/or violence against &quot;infidels.&quot;</p>

<p>If this is the case, why are there so many people on here trying to lessen what happened? I mean really, you can&#39;t have it both ways here.

<p>The reason for this is because driving cars into crowds with the intent to kill many people has so far been a tactic used by ISIS and it is very easy to say &quot;See, I have been telling you that these guys are terrorists and now you have to accept it&quot; when they take actions like this. This was a terrorist attack and it can no longer be denied.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am stuck going back and forth between this was scripted, and this was just taken advantage of by opportunistic groups that seek to inflame all sides of these issues. I think the latter is more likely, and I think you can always find funny and confusing bits after an event like this to construct an apparent conspiracy around.

    <div class="md"><p>I think they&#39;ve just been increasing the pressure on both extremist sides, and it was just a matter of time until something like this happened. In that sense it was &quot;scripted&quot;, but I don&#39;t think they like hired an actor to drive the car or anything. I think that was a real neo-nazi asshole who went mental. But they created the conditions for that type of person to do something like that. And then of course were poised to take advantage of it the minute something <em>did</em> happen. Just like they&#39;re doing with NK and Syria. They&#39;re laying the trap, and they&#39;re ready to react the moment it springs. </p>

<p>I even heard reports that both sides were peaceful, until at one point the white supremecist group was led directly in to the antifa group, by the way the police had positioned themselves. It almost sounds like they kettled the antifa in with the white supremacists intentionally. They&#39;re supposed to stand <em>between</em> the two groups. Also the police were letting the antifa throw bottles at the white supremacists, and then also were afraid to confront any of the white supremacists because of how heavily they were armed. </p>

<p>Lot of fishy crap going on. </p>

<p>I agree though, the key thing is that it&#39;s being used as a psychological operation NOW, and they&#39;ve got quite a foothold to use as leverage. </p>

<p>It&#39;s all documented in a multi-part series on Youtube if you&#39;d like actual footage of actual Swedish citizens talking about their actual problems.</p>

<p>Or you could listen to the New York Times.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>At what point did I say it was a good excuse? I&#39;m not justifying anything this man did.  He is guilty of manslaughter and deserves punishment.  </p>

<p>People on here are claiming this guy had a premeditated plan to drive through a crowd of protesters with the intent of killing them (like a terrorist).  Based upon what I have seen from video footage - it doesn&#39;t fit that objective.  It seems more like an angry reaction (road rage) instead of it being a premeditated terrorist attack.  Again, I&#39;m not taking a side here just pointing out the obvious.  </p>

<p>One guy runs his car in to one person, and the media is acting like nazis are back and civil war is on the horizon. It&#39;s beyond absurd</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A lot of us would not feel guilty saying such a thing in a social setting, because the theory is backed by numerous facts regarding the corporate media being used as a facilitator of collective psychological thinking. In other words, a lot of us do not share in the fear that others will disagree with us because what we know is fundamentally fact based. And we tend to feel the way we do because we understand that separation is a mind-based illusion (despite many people, obviously, disagreeing), creating the sense that race is even a thing worth considering, and there is an agency (that often hides in shadows and behind money) at play that utilizes this Achille&#39;s heal of humanity (the tendency to believe everything we see for convenience sake) by using its money to play with the collective mind that is our species.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How is that the statement you feel most proud of leaving regarding this post? How is that the thing you take away from the sentiment and the implications it carries? People were hurt, and it&#39;s absolutely terrible. No one should ever be hurt regarding the game that is &#39;the world&#39;, because it&#39;s just a game and it&#39;s literally just a thought. We create it with our minds and believe it, but ultimately -- as scientists will tell you (r/holofractal) -- nothing <em>actually</em> exists, so logically, nothing actually matters. It&#39;s ridiculous to get hurt because of your beliefs, because they&#39;re inherently childish. </p>

<p>So, we should turn our attention to the fact that this <em>war</em> seems to be sort of a conceptual, psychological phenomenon that a lot of people are believing but which <em>actually</em> isn&#39;t real. It&#39;s created. And we can also see that a lot of powerful people perpetuate their financial growth via these issues. We shouldn&#39;t just say, &quot;You forgot about our feelings, so screw you.&quot; We should, instead, focus on the facts of the matter so that we can work on their implications. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>this isnt due to the group he is part of, at least not completely.  this kind of shit thinking starts at home when your young.  he is 20.... this is a generational problem.  racism is handed down just like the other habits and nuances you pick up from friends, family and other influences.  he should go to jail and we should keep ignoring stupid fucking kkk members because they dont matter.  the more power you give this story the more power they have.  we need bigger thinking and bigger solutions to this type of problem in america.  on a side note why does it always seem there is some think tank with the worlds leading scientists for stuff that has negitive impact but never one to help solve world hunger or other large global issues.  strange that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Uh maybe some honesty and condemnation of the alt-right for what it really has always been? Fucking rebranded white supremacy with coded language. If people don&#39;t want to be associated with people carrying Nazi flags and giving Nazi salutes maybe they shouldn&#39;t march with them.  Hell, the original march they were changing blood and soil waving torches surrounding students. The point is, people out there who are informed about neo-nazis and their strategies the past decade can see right through this coded rhetoric, can recognize these phrases, for what they are, even if half the country wants to play ignorant and be like &quot;what is racist about the alt right????&quot; People aren&#39;t using &quot;Nazi&quot; as hyperbole, this literally movement literally began on stormfront</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No the prophecy is a locked understanding of destiny by the LORD. In order for Rothschild to fall, it means attacking every angle of white supremacy from numerous amounts of nations.</p>

<p>Thus, as Rothschild is attacked, whites lose power, this in effect will turn whites against minority groups. This is cause and reaction.</p>

<p>An example would be how Obama went for green energy to produce more lucrative and less damaging energy.</p>

<p>Well this in turn hurts coal and oil and which states happen to be have the most coal mines or oil rigs? Who lively hood is that actually effecting? </p>

<p>White folks. </p>

<p>Now take that same idea and apply it to something else like open borders in Europe allowing millions of migrants to move into normally white countries.</p>

<p>What do you think happens?</p>

<p>These things are already in effect, it is only a matter of time before it bursts. </p>

<p>Again, the more Rothschild is attacked economically, the more chaos we will see. </p>

<p>These people did not write the Bible nor did God give them power to do so. Instead, these vagabonds once known as slaves took something that was not theirs and instead of destroying it, they kept it and began to use it the wrong way on purpose. Thus they continued prophecy for it was written they would do so. </p>

<p>Sad what I just said would be considered a nonsense conspiracy theory by 50% of the population, because they&#39;re taught that by that same media. Makes me a little upset.

<p>stormfront has had their page for over a decade, their people used to recruit from this site regularly (probably moved to voat now), those articles were late IMO, FBI and SPLC had numbers that saw a sharp rise right as obama was elected and the crash didn&#39;t help anything either.

Soon he couldn’t have heard anything else even if he had wanted to.

    <div class="md"><p>Extremism in general is rising leading up to the economic failure of the country.  Shit will just get crazier across the board.</p>

<p>So I have one anecdote about black people, my friend owns a super large forum for black people about a thing and he told me that just some short years ago the tone really changed there and some people started using the forum to talk shit about how white people are the cause of all problems in the country.  They use &quot;yt&quot; for &quot;whitey&quot; and sometimes some numerical equivalent of &quot;yt&quot; so that they can talk shit undercover.  They are cultural Marxist, racist, angry people.  He says that its all new within the last four years.</p>

<p>George Soros and others have been paying to foment race wars and it has taken hold and now its just a matter of how large it will get.  Its a build up to a payload for use when the economic situation becomes untenable.  This shit plays out!  I was in Ukraine in a basement bar with chicks, booze, nationalists, some racists and these two guys were adamantly telling me two years before the war that there was going to be a war.  Some weeks later I was invited to a sort of football hooligan Naziesque squat lair to hang out and drink and I found out that someone was paying them to do stuff related to football and their ideologies.  The football touring seemed like cover for political maneuvering and possibly even subversion.  I didn&#39;t really put it all together at the time but I knew that something was up.  I definitely didn&#39;t think that war would break out but I had a strong feeling that extreme mischief was in the works.  It turns out that Soros was all up in that country spending BILLIONS fomenting rebellion.  To this day I have a strong feeling that some of that Soros money was trickling down to these guys and that this is who their patron ultimately was.</p>

<p>My point is simply that shit is brewing and its going to come from a lot of different directions in the community since those knuckleheads of all stripes have been paid and encouraged to be useful idiots when their time has come.  Plus people are just independently stupid, drugged and whatever else.</p>

<p>Somehow the opposing protesters, or &quot;non-alts&quot; so I can bring it down to your level, got all intermingled with the skinheads. Are you surprised at what happened? They are skin heads. Neo Nazi&#39;s... they are IDIOTS with aggressive and violent views.</p>

<p>If this protest BS was happening closer to me, it&#39;s possible I would of been there protesting against neo nazi&#39;s myself.

That&#39;s the way these things are normally set up.

<p>No, in fact I was specifically referencing this incident. The vast majority of us sit somewhere in between the &quot;alt-right&quot; and BLM etc.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t understand. So, like you don&#39;t think a monthly newsletter on ISIS&#39;s goals and accomplishments would give insight as to why their ideology might be attractive to some? You don&#39;t think the official ISIS propaganda that potential recruits would come across before joining has anything to do with that? Really? </p>

<p>Their doctrine has nothing to do with revenge, or at least nothing significant since the creation of the state of Israel. They do not see themselves as being at war with America. They believe they are at war with anyone who does not follow their interpretation of Islam. You need to get your head out of that bubble. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree the alt-right&#39;s  rhetoric is a problem but from what I&#39;ve read, they had a permit and stressed their non-violent intentions. Hence why I believe, had they been left to their own devices, that there may have been some incensed locals but the whole rally would have turned into a non-event.
Also, re: Antifa&#39;s intentions, they seem to stand for shutting down &quot;fascists&quot; (which is often loosely defined: Trump, the alt-right, that Milo guy, Ann Coulter,etc) with violence. Anti-fascist <strong>action</strong> doesn&#39;t make me think of non-violent protests.
Again, I should clarify I am not trying to excuse the alt-right. They are rightfully being condemned by every side. I am simply more concerned about the fact that the violent leftist contingent was not criticised, in fact just the opposite. I am very concerned about violent political groups in the United States on the left and the right.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oy vey.</p>

<p>Hitler had already waged a failed coup before the RFB began their opposition activities.</p>

<p>But surely he was on the verge of giving up before the Rot Front went and set a fire under his ass. /s</p>

<p>To be clear, I do not condone violence on either side, but this bizarre logic of &quot;just don&#39;t look, speak or do anything and it will all go away&quot; is either willfully naive or flat out duplicitous. </p>

I haven&#39;t seen the MSM cover this at all, that they were beating minorities in the streets. This is why I laugh when people here claim the media is radically left wing. Sure they&#39;re condemning the nazis but the right is still pushing the narrative that they were attacked or being civil before anti protesters arrived or that &quot;all sides&quot; are wrong. They couldnt do this if the media showed this. In addition to a professor from UVA saying that the anti protesters saved their lives from nazis that day. None of that has gotten MSM coverage. Shit like this, and putting a spot light on the 5% of unruly BLM protesters instead of the 95% who march peacefully(and unarmed) is why i scoff at all the right wing crying that the media is biased against them. If anything the media has covered up their BS </p>

<p>but yeah you&#39;re right a lot of people don&#39;t want it to be true because it doesn&#39;t fit their narrative.</p>

Why not bitch about the American illegal invasion of the middle east and the current proxy war in Syria killing thousands and sending millions into refugee status?

<p>So they went viral, were widely reported on, and became national headlines... but they were also ignored? That makes zero sense.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They were ignored in this context, they couldn&#39;t politicize it, I remember you also ignore inconvenient facts.</p>

<p>The Manhattan car bowling was done by a Hispanic person high on PCP, so the media ignored it as they couldn&#39;t make it political. The media wasn&#39;t egging Trump to denounce Hispanics for the act of one individual on PCP. The media wasn&#39;t urging Trump to denounce Range Rover guy&#39;s political affiliation for running over those bikes because he feared for his safety. </p>

<p>But they&#39;re doing that for this white supremacist and everyone else in that fringe group because of political reasons. I don&#39;t disagree with the fact what this guy did was wrong, it&#39;s a shitty thing to do. If this was domestic terrorism, then so was the Manhattan guy plowing through people.  All I ask is that the media be consistent, the virality of the videos are irrelevant, in any case the link I posted has 420 views, hardly viral if you ask me.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll also point out that the NYC biker gang incident happened in 2013 and is totally irrelevant to what happened over the weekend. Although the Times Square incident is not as old, it is also irrelevant to what happened in Charlottesville. </p>

<p>Seems you&#39;re desperately grasping at straws in order to deflect. This thread is not about a 2013 road rage incident in NYC. Maybe that&#39;s why you&#39;re ignored? Which is something I should probably consider doing too </p>

<p>How are they unrelated? They&#39;re both involving a driver plowing into a crowd of people and injuring them. The only difference, the reason the media isn&#39;t going haywire over these stories, is because there&#39;s no political motivation. I thought I made that clear.</p>

<p>One guy runs his car in to one person, and the media is acting like nazis are back and civil war is on the horizon.</p>

<p>The fact that thousands of pro-Nazi people are coming out from hiding and participating in public events like this (and to be clear, they are 100% within their rights to do so), is what makes people think that &quot;the Nazis/KKK are coming back&quot;. It&#39;s hard not to draw parallels when you see pictures like <a href="http://usnewz.com/sites/default/files/styles/content/public/news/98276.jpg?itok=DXRvNb6S">this</a> and <a href="http://www.ajc.com/rf/image_large/Wires/w2/NewYorkTimes/2017/08/13/Images/ae9f6d36-5109-4db4-8347-39501e6fb9b9.jpg">this</a> and <a href="https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims3/GLOB/legacy_thumbnail/1028x675/format/jpg/quality/85/http%3A%2F%2Fo.aolcdn.com%2Fhss%2Fstorage%2Fmidas%2F81e85007b128e965a97fb7cb321d4def%2F205265721%2FScreen%2BShot%2B2017-05-14%2Bat%2B10.21.14%2BAM.png">this</a> from Friday in Charlottesville.</p>

<p>Implying that it was just one person driving a car into one other person is incredibly dishonest and it&#39;s disgusting that you minimize the intent here. As you can see clearly from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKIqpUCtEHw">this drone footage</a>, that piece of shit drove his car into a crowd of about 100 people. It is lucky that only 1 person died and I&#39;m sure that asshole will be disappointed to have only murdered one American.</p>

<p>This has nothing to do with the military. The only people talking about going to war are the alt-right as they always do whenever it seems like they won&#39;t get their way on something.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When the truck drove into the crowd in Nice, did you consider that a &#39;tiny ass problem&#39;? Were you telling everyone that they shouldn&#39;t worry about ISIS or Muslims etc?</p>

<p>How about when the van drove into the crowd in London, were you telling everyone that this is a &quot;tiny ass problem&quot; then too?</p>

<p>It seems an awful lot like many people here are trying to minimize this terrorist act just because it was committed by &#39;their side&#39;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;It&#39;s easier to fool a man than to convince him he&#39;s been fooled.&quot; - Mark Twain</p>

<p>I&#39;m afraid we have to convince a bunch of people they&#39;ve been fooled, which is just tough as hell because people are egoistic and prideful and don&#39;t want to admit they&#39;ve been fooled. Or can they move to the next level in a way where they don&#39;t have to realize it, but instead can just adopt a new paradigm? Maybe that would be the trick. I&#39;d rather people just become aware. </p>

<p>Perhaps a trick where for like 3 hours everyone thinks the situation is far more serious than it is, somehow? Make the modern condition incredibly obvious, to everyone all at once. Still seems like a big gamble and I don&#39;t even know what it&#39;d be, really</p>

<li>It&#39;s only &#39;calls&#39; for violence, they won&#39;t hurt anyone.</li>

</ul>

<p>So they&#39;ll keep harassing assaulting and killing innocent people, but in bite sized numbers that can easily be swept under the rug with words like &quot;One guy runs his car into one person&quot;</p>

<p>p.s no I don&#39;t believe there will be a civil war the alt-right/nazis are the north korea of north america and they know it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would like to know who told the police to let fighting happen at all and not to video tape and arrest anyone committing assault. And who&#39;s idea was it to let these to groups meet. There almost as many people with cameras as there where with shields and clubs. Who decided shields and clubs where the weapons of the day? I don&#39;t think we&#39;ve seen racism and fighting like this since the 70&#39;s unless you count the governments crack down on the crack they where selling to inner city blacks to fund a illegal war but thats more the government vs the people not really the people vs the people. Unless this was setup by the government to unite the people against the enemy of right wing Nazi&#39;s and it&#39;s all propaganda to get us to band together the fight the people who keep killing people on our streets.</p>

It is happening for a reason. What we see in mainstream media is 100% controlled and scripted. Now ask yourself why now? Why is this getting so much attention now? Do you think these people are all just coming out of the closet? No they have always been there. You can bitch about a dude hitting a crowd with a car all u want, why dont you also bitch about the daily murders in Chicago? Why not bitch about the American illegal invasion of the middle east and the current proxy war in Syria killing thousands and sending millions into refugee status? I&#39;ll tell you why, because you are a brainwashed cunt. that&#39;s why.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I originally provided a Google search, which the person I was replying to poo-poo&#39;d as showing too many different things, so I picked the first one, sourced it (so you can see the forum conversation it came from was specifically showing Challenger brake lights). Apparently you want to defend the argument about the top-center windshield light which has nothing to with what I&#39;m pointing out. I guess you didn&#39;t understand or are choosing not to.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actual Nazis? Probably stand for being dead and/or dying. Todays morons that attribute to Nazi ideology? Misguided nationalism and extreme levels of ignorance/stupidity. </p>

<p>Actual Nazis, or the old heads of the Nazi part in Germany had a very specific goal in terms of the &quot;final solution&quot; and the creation of a massive Germanic state following the eradication of non-Germans in their relative region and the enslavement of slavs and others. Also potentially world conquest, but immediately just to take over land and slaughter everyone they didn&#39;t like in their way.</p>

<p>If you mean what the general Nazi stood for, it was all kind of bs to conceal Hitler&#39;s actual (next level insane) goals. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I honestly wonder if the people defending James Alex Fields Jr. ever read their post out loud.</p>

<p>I mean would they ever go into a social setting - like a happy hour at a bar or a lunch with coworkers or a picnic after church - and blurt out:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>One guy runs his car in to one person, and the media is acting like nazis are back and civil war is on the horizon. It&#39;s beyond absurd</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If the answer is no, then I hope they realize that they advocating noxious opinions due to the anonymity of the of the internet that they would say in real life because their friends and family would think they are assholes. </p>
