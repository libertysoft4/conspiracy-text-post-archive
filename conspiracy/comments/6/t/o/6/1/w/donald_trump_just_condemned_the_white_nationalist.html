    <div class="md"><p>Um, maybe he wanted to get all the intelligence gathered about the event before pointing fingers and condemning entire groups of people? Maybe he wanted to know exactly who all were acting like violent assholes before kneejerking into supporting this narrative that &quot;Nazis&quot; are terrorizing demonstrations by plowing cars into peaceful crowds? Whatever or whomever drove that car into a crowd did a horrible thing. No one can argue about that. But does it have anything to do with the demonstration?

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, but it&#39;s not like this was an organic Nazi event. These people were paid to show up and start trouble along with Antifa. In reality, racist groups are the fringe of the fringe in this country with perhaps a few thousand legitimate white supremacists. On a national scale, they should be totally irrelevant. They are being in organically thrust into the limelight by MSM for the purpose of fomenting hatred for Donald Trump and supporters. They aim to destabilize this country before the Deep State is exposed and prosecuted by the Trump administration.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No.  It&#39;s their actions.  A violent mob, wandering around and beating people up isn&#39;t exactly the epitome of &quot;anti hate&quot;.  Quite the opposite, actually.</p>

<p>If you claim to oppose hatred and division, and use extreme hatred and division to oppose it, you&#39;ve already lost.</p>

<p>Like I said earlier.  I&#39;m sure most people involved in both sides are reasonable people, trying to make a political statement.  But both sides are poorly represented, and led astray by their fringe zealot minority.  So now both sides get worked up, screeching at the caricature versions of their opponents, instead of doing anything remotely positive.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>LOL. You realize how much additional effort that to rip a video and repost it on another host?  Maybe it would work, maybe it wouldn&#39;t. Effectively they have instituted censorship. But based on your Pro-Trump posting history, you support it and refuse to accept it for what it is. </p>

<p>Must be new here. The satire site you speak of has been banned using direct links here since they were deemed an untrustworthy site. This is so clicks are not generated for that site to create any revenue</p>

<p>So, depending on what news you pay attention to, you may see just one article, or maybe both if you&#39;re lucky. By creating both sides of the story, it continues this thing where you can kind of see Trump however you want to see him, because he&#39;s taken literally every position. </p>
