<p>We know that there are opinions being parroted over and over verbatim by bots, that help frame the conversation and amplify the echo chamber. The internet is turning into a constant stream of drivel where everything is an opinion and facts are worthless. Anyone who proposes filtering the signal from the noise is shot down as an opponent of free speech and biased. It&#39;s completely insane and it is rapidly eroding our cultures outside of the internet.</p>

<p>You completely mischaracterized my statement. I&#39;m not telling people to stop asking questions. I&#39;m just saying be careful not to fall into the other trap of just blindly believing the opposite of what the MSM is saying.</p>

<p>Absolutely agree. However, if the answers to those questions wind up suggesting that he is simply a white nationalist who drove his car into protesters out of anger, then we need to be willing to accept that as well.</p>

<li><p>Free thinking is defined objectively. I.e. in relation to who the user characterizes &quot;free thinkers.&quot; I think that many T_D users on this sub are not &quot;free thinkers.&quot; I would assume they think the same of me.</p></li>
<li><p>As conspiracy theorists we actually <em>depend</em> on the work and research of others. It is critical. This sub is the prime example of that. What other function does this have but to come together as a community of like minded individuals to share, debate and question each other. Ultimately, i have formed my theories on the backs of other users. Off the top of my head, for instance, u/astralrocker2001 made a post one day on a topic i had never even heard of. How am i supposed to interact with info i cant even begin to debate or form my own opinion on? Simple, i didnt need to. I just listened, processed and proceeded. And it changed everything for me. How we filter and process the information is what is important.</p></li>
<li><p>This sub has never been like that. You sound like the Pepperidge farm guy. Nostalgic and dumb as fuck. Conspiracy theorists have always fallen pray to the same human traits as others do. We may be more cyncial, but in general it will occur.</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah the whole comment was nonsense honestly. &quot;Free thinker&quot; isn&#39;t just a term used to classify people in a group. It&#39;s used to describe an individual who decides to take responsibility for him or herself and doesn&#39;t let anyone else make them their bitch or tell him or her to think a certain way or disregard anomalies or to not question the narrative. </p>

<p>A free thinker isn&#39;t just someone who says that they are or says that another group isn&#39;t. It&#39;s someone who&#39;s willing to <strong>think for themselves</strong> and look at the facts objectively to form their probable conclusion, without being influenced by those egotistic assholes telling him or her how and what to think. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, exactly the opposite. Being a free thinker requires a much deeper level of understanding than what I&#39;ve seen demonstrated in this post. I fully support &quot;free thinking.&quot; My issue stems from your approach. </p>

<p>Generally posting about this issue in the broad way that you did is a huge red flag. What are you accomplishing? Like I articulated, <em>everyone</em> defines themselves as a &quot;free thinker.&quot; Think Platos allegory of the cave. The people living in the shadows deem the real world to be fake since all they know is shadow. The parallel would to reddit would be what I described with me and T_D users.

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t push this shit, Nazis were pro-capitalism, but they weren&#39;t Pro-free Market. They believe in what is basically an extreme form of mercantilism. Trying to equate Fascist collectivisation to Communist collectivisation is absolutely inane and just lowers the bar of debate on both. They were very different beasts.</p>

<p>Occam&#39;s Razor says that the simplest explanation is most often the truth. A known white supremacist driving his car into a crowd protesting a white supremacist rally is much simpler than trying to say he&#39;s some antifa plant, or a government psyop agent. You&#39;d have to go in already believing that this was the case to come to this conclusion, and going into an event with an agenda is most likely because you want to shield the most probable instigator from indictment.

<p>State Capitalism is Socialism you utter plonker - the state owns the means of production i.e. the capital. Marxist&#39;s try to argue there&#39;s a difference using surplus value as evidence, but all that means is that economic activity mustn&#39;t be used to create more economic activity i.e. growth.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_capitalism">State capitalism:</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Marxist literature defines state capitalism as a social system combining capitalism...with ownership or control by a state...where the government controls the economy...extracting the surplus value from the workforce in order to invest it in further production.</p>

<p>...many people argue that the modern People&#39;s Republic of China constitutes a form of state capitalism and/or that the Soviet Union failed in its goal to establish socialism, but rather established state capitalism.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So basically attempts at socialism always produce state capitalism because the only difference between the two is Marxist literature. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sargon of Akkad is actively praised and supported by groups such as the EDL</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So what? Does that mean Sargon of Akkad supports the ADL? No it doesn&#39;t. I&#39;m sure the people behind <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enhanced_interrogation_techniques">US government torture programs</a> praised Sigmund Freud. Does that mean Sigmund Freud was pro torture? No it doesn&#39;t. </p>

<p>The only way to make these kinds of statements work is burry a logical fallacy at the heart of them, he same logical fallacy at the heart of all discrimination. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Please don&#39;t get all uppity about the &quot;alt-right&quot; label. </p>

<p>Well maybe its time to invent a suitable label for the people that focus their hate on the alt-right label like yourself. How about marxist-narcissists? Kinda has a ring to it don&#39;t ya think?</p>

I believe outer space is not what they tell us. 
I believe the earth and Antarctica is not what they tell us.
After a lot of research and testing I&#39;ve determined flat earth is more likely true than globe earth. I sincerely believe that it is the greatest conspiracy on earth. Yet... I always feel it mustn&#39;t be talked about in this conspiracy sub reddit. Is there something wrong here?</p>

Much like today, that guy is guilty as fuck, admitted he did it, videos of him doing it including pictures of him in the driver seat, he&#39;s an openly known neo-nazi who is a member of vanguard america, was shown to be with them before the incident. Please point me to where the conspiracy is in this? Isn&#39;t it more likely that there is just a sick motherfucker in a group of neonazis? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s unfortunate that one of the banes of being a flat earther is the constant attacks or questioning of ones academia. Unfortunately a lot of this is through ignorance of exactly how big a puzzle Flat Earth theory is to start making sense, including how gravity doesn&#39;t exist, only up down, buoyancy and density, or how the sun is not big and far but small an localized, just two examples of &quot;unprovable&quot; things (unless you subscribe to the gospels of the religion of NASA). You say I didn&#39;t study physics (I&#39;ve studied plenty of physics), but sometimes the things you learn just aren&#39;t true when new better explanations come to play, like how I mentioned with gravity. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because the parameters of the theory allow most people to automatically dismiss it. It is too big, and is not just a conspiracy theory but has all kinds of other undesirable properties. It requires an astounding number of scientists, teachers, and various public figures to be deliberately misleading everyone, and thus it comes with a fantastic anti-intellectual bent. It requires extraordinary explanations for commonplace things that are much more easily explained by a spherical Earth. It requires our planet to be somehow different than all the others we can observe with the naked eye and low-powered telescopes. I&#39;d sooner believe in Sasquatch, ancient aliens, and a wrathful anthropomorphic god than a flat earth.</p>

<p>What we observe with our eyes and telescopes are just lights. They are &quot;planets&quot; only because NASA and the powers at be indoctrinate you to think stars are giant suns far away and wandering stars are planets. To believe in flat earth you must discredit all space agencies entirely (because they have no credibility) and not accept any source of information from them. Once you do this you realize there is no evidence for a sphere earth or even outer space including the size and distances of the sun, moon, and other aspects of &quot;outer space&quot;. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>All bluster and strong words must be tempered with facts. And some decent theory-building skills. </p>

<p>Theories (all theories whatsoever) come in 3 varieties:
False
Possible &amp;
unfalsifiable</p>

<p>Those are the only choices available. Ever. Doesn&#39;t matter if it&#39;s a murder case, tax fraud, chemistry problem, engineering, recipe mystery, it doesn&#39;t matter. And the only thing differentiating a false theory from a possible one is it&#39;s ability to predict some yet unknown factor, a.k.a., a test.</p>

<p>This of course, only counts for falsifiable theories. If a theory is true under all circumstances, it&#39;s definitely a piece of shit theory and can be immediately discarded. </p>

<p>Take this, refine it. Understand it. It is applicable in all cases past, present and future for any inductive theory that can be dreamed up.</p>
