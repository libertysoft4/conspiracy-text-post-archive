    <div class="md"><p>No.</p>

<p>The only thing i saw was people who had obviously been chssing him down the hill whocrossed the camera atfill speed when thecamera turned justbeford it cit and resumed from thesidestreet.</p>

<p>I find it interesting that there is an edit there. Whywould anyone stop that shot if it wasjust afterhe had seena collision and he wasstill on the street turning?  Snd then resume the shot form the side streetas if he knew the carwoukd come back up the hill.</p>

<p>It seems more likely thst he shot the whole thing bit for some reason wsntedto cut part of whst he had recorded .. or whoever uploadedit did.</p>

<p>I wonder of there is a full version without that cut.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fisrt video</p>

<p>Also you do see someone throw something at his car from the  left side of the street before he hits the crowd.</p>

<p>Ypu also see people beginning to come off the side of the streetbefore he hits the crowd. If he wasdriving looking in his rear view mirrir at the people chasing him then he woukd have seen people throwing things at him and also the crowd closing in. Of he wssscsred or adrelinized he be in fight or flight mode. I actually wonder if he saw the crowd in front or mossed the brake . He does not slow down before hitting thecrowd.</p>

<p>It wasa  new car for him with the old owners license plate still on the back.
If it had a clutch he could have missed the pedals completely.</p>

<p>Edit: so looking again at the first video  i noticed something crucial. He is actually approaching the crowd slowly. Then behind the guy with the green hat someone steps out into thestreet and throws something at the rear of the car and it definitely hits the rearof the car. Itswhite. The driver would have heardit and seen the crowd closing in around him. Its onlg then thst hespeeds up nad hits those in front of him.</p>

<p>Thats prettty crucial.</p>

<p>I dont know why that guy threw something at his car. He wasnt going fast. He only would have seen the sr and possibly the driver who was white. The crowd certainly seemd to be surrounding him to attack BEFORE he hit anyone in the crowd. All those people following him and surrounding him shoukd have been arrested and questioned.</p>

<p>At tje time the guy throwssomething athis car thereis no one in the street whereje is. Then theycome off the side walk into the street behind his car. He hasnt hit anyone yet. It appears it is only then thst he accelerstes and hits the crowd in front.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also second video.</p>

<p>So its hard to tell of his csr is in the crowd before speeding up and hitting them becjase the vidoe is pointed jp.</p>

<p>Howeverits clesr AFRERhe hashit the crowd thstthe street behind him is clear. You cna seemany in the crowd on both sides with clubs. They areall chanting &quot;my streets&quot; </p>

<p>The  peope begin to movein from the sides nad the back to attack the car.</p>

<p>Again. They areall clesr of the car.</p>

<p>Theymove in to attsck the car.</p>

<p>His brake ligjts are on. He is in reverse as you seehis reverselight come on but not backing up . This could be beciase he wants to release people from between the cars.</p>

<p>Then the guy with a basebal bat pits it through the rear window. Imsgine you arein the carand seeand hear that. Especially if you were alresdy being chasedpreviously. You woukd hesr the glassshstterwith a boom. You woukdnt know whetherit was a club or gun or whatbitglasswoukdbe everywhere and you woukd seepeolle with clubs jumping on the back of your car.</p>

<p>Thegirl who is killed also os one who runs up on the car. She is carrying a club. Wesring a baseball cap and backpack and club and skirt over black leggings. She runs towardhim and jumps on the back of the car following the ones in black helmets already clubbing the car. Sje doenst go around to try to help people hirt in front. She is trying to attack the car.</p>

<p>Thedriver hits tje gasto backoutof it quick now.</p>

<p>Everyone except thstgirl go off to the side.</p>

<p>She rolls off to the side and is caught by a psrked caron the side and appears to be crushed between the two cars sides as he escapes. She is left on the pavement.</p>

<p>The guy with the bat who pit a hole through the window reappears and does stop to help the girl like some do. He seems to take off after the car again</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First video</p>

<p>1 you see people were chasing him down the hill when the cameras turns afrer he has hit the crowd. One w blue shoes. One with water bottle yelling. A few more. Then camera cuts.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>While he approaches crowd he is slow. The crowd is one the side of the street.  He hasnt hit anyone yet. The guy hasnt gone up high over the hood yet. Someone behind the green hat throws something white at the back of his car which hits it. The crowd moves in off the sidewalk around his car. He would have seen this and heard the object hit his car. He woud have seen the crowd surrounding his car</p></li>
<li><p>Second video.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>You cant see his car until after he has has hit the people.  But the street is clear on the sides and back of his car then. Very clear. He has brake lights on. Then reverse light but is not yet backing up.</p>

<p>Thugs with black helmets and clubs come from behind and leap on his car with clubs. First club blow goes clear through his back window. Girl runs up with white club to join the thugs on the bsck of the car. She has a cap and backpack and white club and skirt over black leggings.</p>

<p>He begins to back up fast and all except the girl are thrown clear. She gets rolled between the car parked on the side and is left on the pavement.</p>

<p>The guy with the club who put it through the back window ignores the hurt  girl and goes back up the hill looking for the car again.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see a car with what looks like an intact rear window driving toward a crowd of people. At the beginning of the video, the people behind him are along the sides of the road. It looks like he had a clear path backward, which is ultimately the way he ended up getting out.</p>

<p>The people I see only started hitting his car once it looked like his collision with the people was inevitable.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not trying to be intentionally dense here, but it really looks like him speeding into the crowd was totally avoidable. He could have slammed on the brakes and backed out long before he got to the crowd.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes his rear window is unbroken until heis clubbed AFTER his hits the people. Thats clesr from the side view.</p>

<p>However you dod seesomeone throw something athis carbefore he hits the people as he is approaching them.  If that hit his carwhile he was driving...</p>

<p>Also youdo see thst people werechasing him down the hill afterthe camers turns away. Then it cuts  eford resuming again from the side street. So you cant see how many were chasing him. It coukld have been four . It could have been 20 </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Justlooked.</p>

<p>That appears to be a fuller version of the previous first film. Same intersection he went through.</p>

<p>This version doesnt cut and as a result you see a alot of people WERE chasing him. The girl  in the pussy hat is one and ypu see her more she she yells &quot;fucker&quot;. I see over 10 or 20 people running down the street after him around the pussyhat girl.</p>

<p>Of course they arent right on his tail. He is faster. But they are clearly following him at a run down the street and yelling at him.</p>

<p>You think he could have made that turn onto the brick lined street of he was form out of town and trying to leave?</p>

<p>Do you think his gps would have told him to go that way?</p>

<p>What street was that? Looks like a retial store type pedestrian street but lets find it on a map.</p>

<p>Honestly with all the other instances of the mob attacking white people in their cars that I have now seen on vidoes from that day  and this makes it even more clear he was looking for a way out of town before he got mobbed.</p>

<p>The whole town was a lycnh mob going after anyone tjeythoguh was a nazi.</p>

<p>You can see the guy throw the thing a this carmore clearly in this version.</p>

<p>You see more people were chasing him down the street.</p>

<p>It from the same location or almost exact location as the first video.
You see the girl in the pussy hat doing it clearly and yelling &quot;fucker&quot; at him.</p>

<p>It was a full on lynch mob.</p>

<p>Wonder if that town has traffic cmaeras or red light cameras.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m pretty sure he wasn&#39;t looking at his gps. I&#39;m pretty sure he was looking at the crowd of people in front of him as he sped into them. Besides, there were far fewer people behind him than in front. If he&#39;s going to plow through people to get out, doesn&#39;t it make sense to go through the group of fewer people than a whole crowd of them (and with parked cars in it)?</p>

<p>His car still looks undamaged at the beginning of this video. There&#39;s nothing that suggests he was having anything thrown at him by the time he accelerates ahead.</p>

<p>Then why did he slow down a d nearly stop before hitting those people.</p>

<p>And why did he only speed up forward when the person threw something at the back of his car?  And why were those peolle closing in on him from all sides before he hit anyone?</p>

<p>And if he wanted to hit people why did he go all the way down the street?</p>

<p>This guy wasnt from that city.</p>

<p>He was running for his life.</p>

<p>Also people who do a terrorist csr thing either die or commit suicide.</p>

<p>They dont turn themselves in.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fisrt video</p>

<p>Also you do see someone throw something at his car from the  left side of the street before he hits the crowd.</p>

<p>Ypu also see people beginning to come off the side of the streetbefore he hits the crowd. If he wasdriving looking in his rear view mirrir at the people chasing him then he woukd have seen people throwing things at him and also the crowd closing in. Of he wssscsred or adrelinized he be in fight or flight mode. I actually wonder if he saw the crowd in front or mossed the brake . He does not slow down before hitting thecrowd.</p>

<p>It wasa  new car for him with the old owners license plate still on the back.
If it had a clutch he could have missed the pedals completely.</p>

<p>Edit: so looking again at the first video  i noticed something crucial. He is actually approaching the crowd slowly. Then behind the guy with the green hat someone steps out into thestreet and throws something at the rear of the car and it definitely hits the rearof the car. Itswhite. The driver would have heardit and seen the crowd closing in around him. Its onlg then thst hespeeds up nad hits those in front of him.</p>

<p>Thats prettty crucial.</p>

<p>I dont know why that guy threw something at his car. He wasnt going fast. He only would have seen the sr and possibly the driver who was white. The crowd certainly seemd to be surrounding him to attack BEFORE he hit anyone in the crowd. All those people following him and surrounding him shoukd have been arrested and questioned.</p>

<p>At tje time the guy throwssomething athis car thereis no one in the street whereje is. Then theycome off the side walk into the street behind his car. He hasnt hit anyone yet. It appears it is only then thst he accelerstes and hits the crowd in front.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also second video.</p>

<p>So its hard to tell of his csr is in the crowd before speeding up and hitting them becjase the vidoe is pointed jp.</p>

<p>Howeverits clesr AFRERhe hashit the crowd thstthe street behind him is clear. You cna seemany in the crowd on both sides with clubs. They areall chanting &quot;my streets&quot; </p>

<p>The  peope begin to movein from the sides nad the back to attack the car.</p>

<p>Again. They areall clesr of the car.</p>

<p>Theymove in to attsck the car.</p>

<p>His brake ligjts are on. He is in reverse as you seehis reverselight come on but not backing up . This could be beciase he wants to release people from between the cars.</p>

<p>Then the guy with a basebal bat pits it through the rear window. Imsgine you arein the carand seeand hear that. Especially if you were alresdy being chasedpreviously. You woukd hesr the glassshstterwith a boom. You woukdnt know whetherit was a club or gun or whatbitglasswoukdbe everywhere and you woukd seepeolle with clubs jumping on the back of your car.</p>

<p>Thegirl who is killed also os one who runs up on the car. She is carrying a club. Wesring a baseball cap and backpack and club and skirt over black leggings. She runs towardhim and jumps on the back of the car following the ones in black helmets already clubbing the car. Sje doenst go around to try to help people hirt in front. She is trying to attack the car.</p>

<p>Thedriver hits tje gasto backoutof it quick now.</p>

<p>Everyone except thstgirl go off to the side.</p>

<p>She rolls off to the side and is caught by a psrked caron the side and appears to be crushed between the two cars sides as he escapes. She is left on the pavement.</p>

<p>The guy with the bat who pit a hole through the window reappears and does stop to help the girl like some do. He seems to take off after the car again</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The first video BEGINS after the attack is underway. He&#39;s already accelerating into the crowd.</p>

<p>The second video doesn&#39;t show anyone attack his car until after it runs into the crowd.</p>

<p>You have not shown me ANYONE attack his car before he accelerates into the crowd.</p>
