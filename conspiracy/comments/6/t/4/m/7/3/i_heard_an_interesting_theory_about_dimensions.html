        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Last year, I heard a theory about dimensions. This guy (Tom) said that whatever you believe and focus on, you&#39;ll end up in the dimension that will bring you closest to that outcome before you die.</p>

<p>We don&#39;t really know much about how different dimensions or interdimensional travel works, so I&#39;d personally say this is plausible.</p>

<p>Is the human mind so powerful that we&#39;re interdimensional creatures without even knowing it? Could it be possible that if we all focus on, say, nuclear war or economic collapse that we&#39;ll have a nuclear war or see the economy collapse just because we, as a collective consciousness focused on it for a while and ended up in the universe that has one of those happen? Is it possible for multiple universes to exist and for each individual person to pass in and out of certain ones just by focusing on different things?</p>

<p>What do you guys think? Plausible or bullshit?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The truth is....The bible is somewhat true. God created Adam and Eve in the garden of eden. Adam and Eve were given the power to will into existense anything they needed. Lucifer saw gods experiment and said &quot;What good is it if they have no knowledge of what they are doing? They have no free will to truly create the world around them. This is more like watching fish in a fish tank&quot; So lucifer went down to talk to Adam and said &quot;Hey buddy did you know you can create literally anything you need simply by thinking about it?&quot;. Adam did not understand. Lucifer said &quot;I can show you how your power really works but it comes with free will. And free will comes with the poetential for abuse.&quot; Adam agreed and suddenly the world around him was transformed from a simple sandbox to an overwhelming amount of complexity! Like teaching a 4 year old 2 +2 and then suddenly telling him hes been doing calculus all along and the equaion actually looks like y(2x4+y)dydx=(1−4xy2)x2! Free will gave Adam and eve the ability to change all aspects of the world around them but it also made them awaken to the complexity of the world god had created! Suddenly it wasn&#39;t so easy to will an apple tree into existense, instead adam was frustrated and wondered how he could create something so complex!</p>

<p>Being that adam and eve were the only 2 humans the power was strong between the two of them. They were still able to get what they needed for the most part but life went from being a breeze to being a struggle. </p>

<p>Along with free will came the ability to procreate which is where we doomed ourselves. You see the more we make copies of ourselves the weaker the power gets. The power of will gets spread out amongst the whole population and is often muddied by conflicting wants and desires. </p>

<p>Collectivism and group think help regain the power of will but it is getting weaker by the day as the population grows. </p>

<p>The power of will is confirmed in the movie <strong>&quot;The Secret&quot;</strong> where it was confirmed the the illuminati have had knowledge of this power for hundreds of years and have been using it for just as longs.</p>

<p>If you want something bad enough and focus and use the techniques from the movie &quot;The Secret&quot; you will get what you want but it is much more difficult then it was back in the day due to poulation growth.</p>

<p>We are literally creating the world around us and have full control of our destiny but we lack the ability to fathom the complexities of our power to properly harness it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is my favorite thread in a long time. </p>

<p>I think it&#39;s plausible. Positive and negative energy resonate on different spectrums of wave lengths. Depending on which one is dominant, it&#39;s possible that we&#39;re tuning into, much like a radio, into a specific frequency were the outcome is predetermined by the energy that is projected. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea, and the portion of the mind that is sending and receiving is our attention, and concentration. Our attention is literally the Self, it is enormously powerful. And concentration is just that. A concentration of energy. This concentration of energy is extremely attractive. It&#39;s attractive because it attracts more energy to it.  It&#39;s that simple.  But the experiences that are expressions of that energy concentration are Abstract. You could be focusing your attention on something and it will attract that same energy but the abstract physical experience could be so random it&#39;s hard to realize it&#39;s that energy. You have to be good at this game to notice how your energy in every single moment of every single day is generating attraction and how that manifests in the abstract.  Once you see it&#39;s non stop synchronicity then you have it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think what you just wrote can be explained through the psy effects of telepathy and somewhat blind &quot;forward-remembering&quot;. Other people have this gift too, enabled through the use of quantum effects in the brain (pineal gland etc...). Think of it like an orchestra of telepathy and forward remembering taking place on a daily basis when you go out into society. </p>

<p>There are some experiments in physics showing the past and future somewhat come into coherence in the present moment, at least the way we perceive reality (look into retrocausality). There are also experiments in psychology showing that people can detect things (monitor blood pressure to see the effect) that illicit strong emotions moments before they are exposed to them.</p>

<p>I just read into synchronicity and was not aware that many quantum physicists suspected it to be true as well. I came to this conclusion through different methods. Or maybe me just reading about it is feeding my past thinking ;)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t believe in the supernatural at all. That said, I think all of the weird phenomenon we see reported is true insofar as the person reporting it is able to understand. Some day science will be able to describe the nature of reality in such a way that we know why these kinds of things happen. Why I see a new word in a book, and a week later have an actual need for knowing what that word means. Ghosts and shit, intersection reality, the difference between coincidence and coincidence, who knows? </p>

<p>Reality is much more complicated than I think anyone is willing to give it credit. There is a shame to not knowing things, so to prevent shame, we will often accept inadequate answers we are able to understand, rather give in to the real mysteries of reality.</p>

<p>I agree that we&#39;ll come to understand a lot that currently seems unexplainable through science, and I try to follow the latest developments from the QM world. I also agree that there&#39;s a ton of bullshit out there, such as phony &quot;psychics&quot; and what not.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You should take a deep dive into <a href="/r/DimensionalJumping">/r/DimensionalJumping</a></p>

<p>Most sacred texts have some sort of references to &quot;everything happens in the now&quot;.  As in past, present and future all happen at the exact same time.  </p>

<p>But how can that be true?  </p>

<p>Many people think that it&#39;s a simple reference to how our day passes.  We experience a series of moments then they&#39;re gone and that may very well be what the ancient writers meant when they wrote those things.  </p>

<p>However there is another possibility which is that time as we know it, is bullshit and everything all happens at the same time.  That every possibility for every action has already happened, is happening, will happen but they all occur simultaneously.  So then why do we experience the passage of time?  </p>

<p>Well that&#39;s an interesting question.  Time is a totally made up human concoction based on what we observe, mathematical/scientific agreement and logic.</p>

<p>So try thinking &quot;outside the box&quot; and ask yourself, how is it possible for everything to exist at the same time?  We would still have to deal with the passage of time that we&#39;ve experienced since our births.  So how?</p>

<p>Well one possibility is that the movement and motion we experience in an action such as walking might be our consciousness simply moving through a series of static scenes.  </p>

<p>Wait what?  </p>

<p>Most people these days aren&#39;t familiar with &quot;motion pictures&quot; or older film style cameras.  So how they work is to flash a series of static a/k/a non-moving images (just like a photograph) on the screen in rapid succession, so quickly is the image changed that our eyes don&#39;t register the change.  This begins to happen at 24 images per second.  </p>

<p>So when you pull the film out of the projector, you don&#39;t see moving images on the film.  No you see static images that are simply changed at 24 frames per second and we can&#39;t perceive the change so we see movement.</p>

<p>Now imagine in that switching was sped up but not a little.....a lot.  </p>

<p>Not 24 frames per second, or 240 (10x faster), 2400 (100x faster) or any of that.  What if it was sped up to millions, billions or even trillions of frames per second.  </p>

<p>Could we even perceive the changing image?</p>

<p>It&#39;s doubtful we could perceive that change.  However that might very well be what&#39;s happening with reality.  How would we know?</p>

<p>Well if we could jump to a non-logical timeline or a non-logical existence of reality then we might know.  A non-logical existence would be where things in our lives don&#39;t make sense from the flow we once knew.  </p>

<p>For example, we went to X high school then onto Y college then Z job.  Well what if any one of those were to change.  So instead of Y college we went to H college instead and then that flowed into I job instead of Z job.  </p>

<p>When people dimensionally jump some are reporting that they&#39;re doing and experiencing exactly that.  </p>

<p>But for me, it&#39;s all just cool theory because I&#39;ve never experience that.  Or at least I don&#39;t remember experiencing that.</p>

<p>However, I&#39;ve experienced a great many mind bending things so anything is possible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>while focusing on something may have a yet to be measured affect, a vastly more efficient and responsible course of action would be to actively physically pursue more direct action. you can look at the nearest light switch and focus on it, i will get up and flip it with my finger. let me know when you get your switch flipped. at best, focusing on an outcome will help you be aware of actions you can take that may help you get closer to the desired outcome... it is said faith without work is dead. faith is an action word, not just an internal mental state.</p>
