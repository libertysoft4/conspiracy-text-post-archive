The most important thing I learned is that if you don&#39;t remember history, then it can/will repeat itself. I don&#39;t view these Confederate monuments as a lasting image of a war or ideology lost. If anything, I see this monuments as a reminder of where the country came from, and where we are now.

<p>Btw, if you don&#39;t mind I solicit your expertise, what have you learned about Albert Pike? Any validity to the 3 world war quotes attributed to him? And did he really have as much of an impact as some theorists make him out to be? (Some say he begot the KKK and ADL, and was pretty much the main guy who made the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry as significant as it became)</p>

<p>Certain segments of society have, yes. People feel lost, powerless, and hopeless. Taking down statues makes them feel like they have control and that they&#39;re accomplishing something. When you realize that, it completely explains the whole SJW segment of our society. </p>

<p>Many of these statues were erected as part of a pushback against the Civil Rights movement. Not because they wanted to memorialize the mistakes of the past, but because they wanted to send a racist message.</p>

<p>But even with all that aside, these statues exist to glorify traitors. If a town or community decides they don&#39;t want to glorify traitors anymore, then they can take them down.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the only reason to deprive them is if you assume you know what they were fighting for. there are tons of different motivations in war. the majority of soldiers were fighting because they were drafted. I&#39;m sorry that you have been tricked into believing that the civil was was about freeing slaves might i remind you that slavery is still legal in america if you are incarcerated and that 30 million people world wide are slaves. so much for that argument. so was it to make blacks and whites equal... well no in the words of the most beloved president in existence Abradolf Lincler </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I will say then that I am not, nor ever have been in favor of bringing about in anyway the social and political equality of the white and black races - that I am not nor ever have been in favor of making voters or jurors of negroes, nor of qualifying them to hold office, nor to intermarry with white people; and I will say in addition to this that there is a physical difference between the white and black races which I believe will forever forbid the two races living together on terms of social and political equality. And inasmuch as they cannot so live, while they do remain together there must be the position of superior and inferior, and I as much as any other man am in favor of having the superior position assigned to the white race. I say upon this occasion I do not perceive that because the white man is to have the superior position the negro should be denied everything.&quot; -Lincoln-Douglas debates, 1858.</p>

<p>Yes, it&#39;s unfortunate that the masses were forced into sacrificing their lives for the elites in the name of a terrible cause. So why do those elites deserve immortality?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It wasn&#39;t about it &quot;losing support&quot;. It was about how expensive it was to own slaves vs using machines to do the work. </p>

<p>And there was a lot more to &quot;freeing the slaves&quot; than the altruistic-seeming tagline. Free them <em>to where</em>? Where were they going to live, what were they going to eat? Don&#39;t even get me started on what happened to the children of slaves that were forcibly taken from their families, put on steamships and placed in northern orphanages to be &quot;homed&quot; with proper Northern white families. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>How would you feel about Nazi flags hanging on a German courthouse or government building? How do you feel about the ten commandments being on courthouse grounds?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think most want to destroy the statues altogether but rather move them from places of honor and authority (on the courthouse steps for example) to a museum - where they can, exactly as you suggest, remind people of the past.</p>

<p>There is a major difference between trying to hide the past and simply trying to stop glorifying it. Placing things such as confederate statues, Nazi flags, or the ten commandments on government property such as courthouses shows more than just &quot;reminding people of the past,&quot; it shows some kind of tacit approval of that message.  </p>

<p>I would bet most here would be offended if courthouses were allowed to display huge ten commandment statues in their lobbies. If you have a problem with that then ask yourself why. Because if you do you should have similar concerns with confederate statues being in the same location.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Slavery was a rallying point for republicans to start a war over democrat succession in the south.  The truth of the matter is far more complex than emancipation, and I cringe every time that I hear ignorant people call the confederates traitors.  </p>

<p>Succession was a right granted to the states, and the average confederate soldier never owned slaves.  Many confederate soldiers joined to protect their land and families.  I am fine with any state or municipal government removing statues or relocating them as I believe in federalism, but erasing or editing history benefits no one. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Extremism begets extremism.  I grew up in the 80/90&#39;s and began my adulthood as a moderate Republican.  Over time, I&#39;ve watched Republicans move further and further to the right, which pushed me to the left.  So I now consider myself a moderate liberal - which is where it seems most of my peers are.</p>

<p>However, for those that are older (60+) or younger (30-), it seems they&#39;ve been sucked up by the extremes - on both sides.</p>

<p>So you have the people my age, who can see both sides of this Confederate debate, and honestly probably don&#39;t give a shit either way and would prefer to just leave it to the communities to decide.  You have the old people who are hanging strong to tradition, refusing to accept that the intention of these memorials were predominately racist and a &quot;fuck you&quot; to the Union.  And you have the young people that are saying &quot;fuck that&quot; and tearing the memorials down - which is not the right way to handle the situation.</p>

<p>The extremes are taking over (just like this sub) and everyone in the middle is being forced to choose sides or get stomped on.  The right is stomping on people&#39;s personal liberties and the left is going social justice warrior and <strong>ALSO</strong> stepping on people&#39;s liberties.  </p>

<p>At the end of the day, we&#39;re losing our personal liberties because the extremists have lost their goddamn minds.</p>

<p>Or, that&#39;s my take on it all anyway.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Perfectly fine with anything being in a museum, or on privately owned property. I think it&#39;s anyone&#39;s right to display what they want to in a case like this. If an employer doesn&#39;t like it and wants to fire them, or a business doesn&#39;t want to serve them for what they chose to display, that&#39;s fine too!  So long as we&#39;re talking private businesses at least. </p>

<p>As for public/state property, id like to see these things be voted on, perferably in a way that the public has as much personal representation as possible like a referendum. I don&#39;t really like seeing groups literally rip these things down, but if the people of the town/city want it gone that should be something that can happen. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t see what the big deal with the statues is. I think if there was a major war it&#39;s pretty normal to have statues of the generals just to keep track of it. Plus, I think its a reminder to the people who actually have ancestors that died in the war.</p>

<p>Add to this the fact that the U.S. barely has any history compared to other countries and you see how ridiculous it is to try to get rid of statues about one of the few major wars the U.S. was involved in. </p>

<p>I think people are reading into this too much and trying to oversimplify people&#39;s motives and beliefs. It&#39;s one thing to vote democratically to take them down, and another to just topple them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Slavery was a rallying point for republicans to start a war over democrat succession in the south.  The truth of the matter is far more complex than emancipation, and I cringe every time that I hear ignorant people call the confederates traitors.  </p>

<p>Succession was a right granted to the states, and the average confederate soldier never owned slaves.  Many confederate soldiers joined to protect their land and families.  I am fine with any state or municipal government removing statues or relocating them as I believe in federalism, but erasing or editing history benefits no one. </p>

<p>Our past is full of lessons we must not forget or we are destined to repeat them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I too don&#39;t gaf what you think or find pathetic.  The history of our country is important, and it should be preserved not destroyed.  The vigilante destruction of statues does absolutely nothing to move us forward.  Go fuck yourself.</p>
