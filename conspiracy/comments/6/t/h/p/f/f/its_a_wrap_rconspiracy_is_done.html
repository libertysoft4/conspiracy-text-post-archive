<p>As for that photo, there are several questions one could raise about it, but only now for the first time I&#39;ve noticed that of course there are many shoes on the ground, a classic sign of Masonic rituals that is present at all of the aforementioned fake car attacks.

    <div class="md"><p>Someone commented here last night that they thought it was strange as well.  Until they got a job in EMS and realized that it was quite common for shoes to fly off when hit by a car.  If you google, you&#39;ll see this question has been asked for years - with rational explanations.</p>

<p>I think that&#39;s much more likely than Freemasons carrying a bag of shoes around to sprinkle at the scene in some kind of ritual, no?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Heavy handed modding is surely a bad thing. The shills have to be defeated by exposing their arguements for what they really are which is defense for the cabal. </p>

<p>For example, I might post Bush Jr is crap and a shill will say &quot;Show me 1 sliver of evidence showing Bush Jr is a bad guy&quot; knowing that smoking gun proof is hard to come by. A good response to this is &quot;You seem to be very defensive of the Bush family. Do you have a stake in the family?&quot;</p>

<p>This strategy unmasks the shill on the spot because they usually come back with a weak arguement or they simply don&#39;t respond plus, being that it&#39;s a public post, everyone else gets to see it and identify the shill as well.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s all about getting the evidence together. For example, it is best to start by looking at the age of the account. Shill accounts are typically every new. They also defend the deep state at all costs and try to debunk the OPs conspiracy posts at every turn. There&#39;s a lot to it but those are a few examples of it works. </p>

<p>You&#39;re asking for proof that can only be administered by the admins of this  entire site. </p>

<p>We can however, look at circumstantial evidence surrounding the issue such as McDonalds Threads with &quot;bmac&quot; in the image file getting upvoted to the front page, and the addictive nature  of Elgin air force base has with reddit etc etc. </p>

<p>For example, I might post Bush Jr is crap and a shill will say &quot;Show me 1 sliver of evidence showing Bush Jr is a bad guy&quot; knowing that smoking gun proof is hard to come by. A good response to this is &quot;You seem to be very defensive of the Bush family. Do you have a stake in the family?&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Personally, I think this is a bad way to handle that type of question. All that does is try to discredit someone who is asking a question any good theory is supposed to answer anyway. It instantly ends any kind of deliberative discourse on the subject and just turns into you trying to label them as shills. It undermines academic honesty.</p>

<p>Even if they were shills, you should still be able to address their questions. If your theory can&#39;t hold up to even modest scrutiny it&#39;s probably not a good theory to begin with.</p>

<p>I would prefer people stick to ideas and not try to assign labels. Trying to discredit your opponent without addressing their point reeks really badly of disinformation tactics. This sub should be above that.</p>

<p>There is a lot of info on the astroturfing organizations Correct the Record, ShareBlue and Media Matters.

<p>An Oxford research paper on astroturfing:</p>

<p><a href="http://comprop.oii.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/89/2017/07/Troops-Trolls-and-Troublemakers.pdf">Troops, Trolls and Troublemakers: A Global Inventory of Organized Social Media Manipulation</a></p>

<p>From this Oxford research paper on astroturfing:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There is no doubt that individual social media users can spread hate speech, troll other users, or set up automated political communication campaigns. Unfortunately, this is also an organized phenomenon, with major governments and political parties dedicating significant resources towards the use of social media for public opinion manipulation.</p>

<p>... In many countries, political actors have no reported ability to field social media campaigns. In some countries, one or two known political actors occasionally use social media for political messaging, and in a few other countries there are multiple government agencies, political parties, or civil society groups organizing trolling and fake news campaigns.</p>
