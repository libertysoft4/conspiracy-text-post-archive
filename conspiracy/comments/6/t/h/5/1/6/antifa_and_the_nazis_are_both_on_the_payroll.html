    <div class="md"><p>Yep, I&#39;ve been subscribed to &quot;AlternativeViewTV&quot; (one word) on YouTube for a couple years.  I was delighted when I found them.   I don&#39;t know if Frank Morrow and Douglas Kellner are still living, but their wondrous work lives on.  Like you said, they were real journalists.  </p>

<p>Their YouTube channel has interviews with lots of people like anti-CIA activists John Stockwell, Philip Agee, and many others.  They were based in Austin, TX.  Love them!</p>

<p>By the way, although their televised program was called &quot;Alternative Views&quot; (with an &quot;s&quot;), the YouTube channel does not have the &quot;s&quot; and is spelled  &quot;AlternativeViewTV&quot; (no &quot;s&quot;).  Hope you enjoy it too.</p>

<p>That&#39;s not what I said, but if you look into the situation in <a href="http://www.larouchepub.com/eiw/public/2017/eirv44n08-20170224/04-21_4408.pdf">Ukraine</a>, Soros was supporting actual, literal Nazis.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Thousands of these neo-nazis</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thousands of people showed up. Most of them were not neo Nazis. Facts matter, and you&#39;re inventing them because you don&#39;t like other people&#39;s politics.</p>

<p>In short, you are being mind-controlled by fake politics.</p>

<p>What would you call people who support neo-nazi groups, wear neo-nazi uniforms, and chant neo-nazi slogans and phrases?</p>

<p>I call them neo-nazis. You?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Nah, I just don&#39;t buy your weak attempts to gaslight others. Like what you&#39;re trying to do right here.</p>

<p>And with this one too. </p>

<p>I will say this too, for someone who&#39;s trying to portray themselves as a type of mediator or peacemaker, you sure are defensive when someone criticizes neo-nazis. </p>

<p>&quot;4. Use a straw man. Find or create a seeming element of your opponent’s argument which you can easily knock down to make yourself look good and the opponent to look bad. Either make up an issue you may safely imply exists based on your interpretation of the opponent/opponent arguments/situation, or select the weakest aspect of the weakest charges. Amplify their significance and destroy them in a way which appears to debunk all the charges, real and fabricated alike, while actually avoiding discussion of the real issues.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly right.  I work with dozens of black, working class guys; many of them self-employed.  These guys simply do not connect to leftist politics and they&#39;re in no rush to support the Dems in any way, much less antifa or Nazi&#39;s.  By September-October of 2016 I was like &quot;the polls arent seeing what I&#39;m seeing. There are A LOT of black men voting for Trump.&quot; And after the election they werent being swayed by the media&#39;s constant drum beat to oust him. I dont mean this to be a pro-Trump comment. I&#39;m saying it to point out that there was some American solidarity and pride and brotherhood stuff taking place out here. By out here I mean off of CNN-MSNBC-FOX-ABC-REDDIT-TWITTER, and in the building trades.  Shit was feeling good man.  But perhaps unity among the working and middle class isnt in the best interests of those who seek power over us.   ....  So now what? The country is obsessed by fake ass Nazi&#39;s?  Of which there are probably no more 2 or 3 thousand nationwide? 10% of which are probably undercover FBI?  And media talking heads are accusing Trump of fomenting Nazi violence?  Fucking please! </p>

<p>C&#39;mon man your post history is full of you defending Trump and posting in T_D.</p>

<p>Have your opinions and feel free to express them but I do find it odd many Trump supporters here in this sub, and elsewhere, tend to try and seem neutral by similar statements, while they are clearly not</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I truly didn&#39;t mean that to be a pro-Trump comment.  I was trying to provide a real-life example of how some of the things that have divided us in the past, and some of the ways we were divided (in this case, all blacks always voting Dem) are melting away. And so &quot;those that would seek to control us&quot; need another way to keep us divided.  I thought my example was &quot;on topic,&quot; but I can see how someone could be skeptical since I do support many Trump policies and I do think he deserves to be defended against many of the more outrageous slurs. I guess you&#39;re free to discount my opinion because truth be told I roll my eyes anytime someone says something that attempts to cast Hillary or others like her in any light other than negative.</p>

<p>That&#39;s not a sound conclusion from your premise. Politics is fake, but that doesn&#39;t mean the world is lost. In fact, it&#39;s really quite saveable, and will be saved in short order. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good post. Sensationalist corporate media will jump at the chance for trying to divide the people.
People need to stop screaming &quot;LIBTARD&quot; and &quot;CONTARD&quot; and start reading up on political science to see how much they&#39;ve been scammed. We are ruled by NEOliberals and NEOconservatives, both far right authoritarian corporate whores. (Elite bankers control most corporations.)
Violent type of protest is a trap anyway.</p>
