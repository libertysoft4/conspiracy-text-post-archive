<p>just making the casual observation that censorship will increase rather than decrease potential audience and inherently, like the drug war or prohibition, will not work.</p>

<p>censorship is just the prohibition of ideas, and trying to prohibit thought, for good or bad reasons, will usually have the inverse effect on society better to just leave it alone, and let it take care of itself through example. if the ideas really are inherently bad and wrong, they usually will not succeed</p>

<p>I really think this huge polarization caused by censorship could be avoided, and also that it serves to further divide and conquer and cement these groups into the ground as &#39;martyrs&#39; in a sense.</p>

<p>I really think the most effective course of action is often NO course of action at all.</p>

<p>terrorist attacks? show them they don&#39;t phase us as we sing hymns about our valiant dead entering Valhalla or some shit. make it ridiculous. it will have no effect.</p>

<p>in a lot of senses, turning the other cheek makes more sense.</p>

<p>there is a point where action must be taken, but over the shit its happened over, it wasn&#39;t that point yet.</p>

<p>Assuming you said &#39;yes&#39; to this, then what if every month, you witness thousands of people converting to Islam and carrying out attacks as a result of his preaching. Would you still allow him to continue?</p>

<p>Tolerance and freedom are very important, but there has to be a line where you say that someone&#39;s speech is a genuine danger to others and must be curtailed - exactly the same as why we can&#39;t yell &quot;Fire!&quot; as a prank in a cinema.</p>

<p>No, he wasn&#39;t. As part of obtaining a firearms permit they ask if you use illegal drugs.  He had thc in his sustem at the time of death, and his girlfriend admitted they had been smoking and had weed in the car. So to make this extra clear, gun + drugs = illegal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I paid attention very closely.  That&#39;s why I used the example I used.  Weimar Germany had strict hate speech laws, which were applied quite aggressively against the Nazis.  It didn&#39;t work.  Instead, once the Nazis came into power, they used the existing hate speech laws to consolidate their power and social control. </p>

<p>If you deny speech to Nazis, (a) it doesn&#39;t work and (b) the muzzle will be in your own mouth before you know it.  That is why the ACLU is defending the Unite the Right rally, and you should be, too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well your point is moot because we don&#39;t have hate speech laws. The government isn&#39;t denying their right to assemble. Society and private citizens need to show them that their views are disgusting they don&#39;t feel embolden by the president. No one should feel like they have to defend Nazis and the intolerant. The only people that feel that way are Nazi sympathizers. Private citizens aren&#39;t the ACLU, and the ACLU speaks out against racists just like they did today regarding ex-sheriff arpaio. </p>

<p>That doesn&#39;t justify violence, nor incitement of violence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Turning the other cheek is actually a Biblical saying. Jesus, in a parable (can&#39;t recall which one) mentioned turning your face and presenting your other cheek to expose the master&#39;s cruelty. Most people take that phrase out of context, like it&#39;s some sort of &quot;peaceful&quot; thing. In actuality, it&#39;s an act of non-violent defiance against oppression.</p>

<p>I remember when I heard that explanation in my early 20&#39;s, it changed the way I viewed Jesus and other Biblical teaching. Made me despise the religion and how they twisted these radical and inspiring concepts from Christ into something so toothless and safe. Stupid christians...ruinin shit just for the sake of it. </p>

They squawk absolute nonsense because theyre psychotic, and incite braindead henchman to harass gunowners, who are their most powerful &quot;opponents&quot;</p>

<p>The poison in our national discourse is pretty disturbing.  People are losing their friggin minds over fairly unimportant shit.  Seeing a video of the &quot;Nazi&quot; march in the city...  holy hell.  It&#39;s pretty sad when an angry mob of violent SJW&#39;s makes stupid Nazi racists look calm and civilized.  What is the world coming to?</p>

<p>If a small group of Muslims did a small rally in the city, and were surrounded by mobs of angry violent white people, waving weapons at them, threatening and attacking them, then the framing would be a whole lot different.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ironically, most of the ISIS supporters in America live in Washington D.C.  They even pay these guys, and give them supplies and air support, to spread their mercenary terror wherever they&#39;re needed.  So a mob of angry people going after <em>actual</em> ISIS supporters would be a great step for all of us.</p>

<p>But equating ISIS with these modern &quot;neo-nazi&quot; morons is hopelessly misguided.  One is currently wreaking havoc in the middle East, murdering, displacing, and terrorizing anyone the CIA tells them to.  The other is a group of small minded racists with no political or military clout whatsoever.</p>

<p>These aren&#39;t your grandfather Nazis (who mostly moved into the U.S. government after the war, anyway).  These are just dumb hicks who think their skin color gives them some special place in the world.</p>

<p>remember, income tax was PROMISED to be done away with. the federal reserve was setup after the death of the bank behind closed doors on Christmas when congress wasn&#39;t in session.</p>

<p>regardless of whether or not this specific group should be physically removed themselves, I personally fear the possible consequences of such actions being taken, and the overall attitude change I have witness in my small little life.</p>

<p>all debates, really, seem to be handled behind closed doors by small groups of independent people.</p>

<p>really, I&#39;m unsure people even know how to debate in the mainstream anymore, or are willing to argue and take the passion and emotion and personal interest out of it enough to have a logical, coherent debate between sides.</p>

<p>I really believe this was by design, and is a major problem in society.</p>

<p>we simply cannot setup public forums and debate anything without torching each other over what basically amount to &#39;petty religious squabbles&#39; in a fancy modern new dress</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you don&#39;t agree Europe has expanded their hate speech laws and speech codes? You don&#39;t agree Google and FB are cracking down on speech <em>they</em> deem &quot;offensive&quot;? Are you denying facts, because that&#39;s what these are -- verifiable facts. </p>

<p>Or are you saying what they&#39;re doing is okay because you agree with them? And what happens when you don&#39;t agree with them? Should I mention all the people suspended from FB for saying &quot;Kill All Men&quot; and shit who are now outraged it happened even though those are the rules them, and you, seem to be advocating for? But that&#39;s not something that will happen, though, because it&#39;s a &quot;hard line&quot;.. you know, the line <em>you</em> agree with. </p>

<p>What about American campuses? What about public universities, getting tax dollars, no platforming people who have a <em>legal</em> right to speak? What about public campuses making &quot;free speech&quot; zones, saying free speech can only happen in <em>those</em> zones? Are these things that are not happening or are these things you agree with because you happen to side with the current elites? Would you have felt the same way about these same laws 100 years ago when the bible thumpers were in charge? </p>

<p>The minute you say someone else can&#39;t have free speech, then nobody has it. It&#39;s really not that hard, and it&#39;s something that has been proven -- time and again -- throughout history. </p>

<p>On that note, I find your use of cussing towards me to be a form of violence. Looks like you don&#39;t get your speech rights... whoops! </p>

<p>You&#39;re purposefully misrepresenting my argument. You&#39;re either paid to be here or your a deceitful, lying, piece of shit. Pick one. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve never once defended racism, hate, bigotry or anything of the sort. I&#39;ve defended their right to be spoken. It&#39;s a difference you <em>know</em> but are refusing to accept. It&#39;s you is the imbecile. </p>

<p>Pedophiles have every fucking right to speak about their condition. They should not be no platformed. Salon has every right to run their articles in defense of pedophilia. </p>

<p>They do not have the right to call for a direct and eminent threat to children. It&#39;s literally in our constitution, fuckwit. Do you think our constitution should be thrown out the window?

<p>Actually, people like <em>me</em> understand the difference between words and actions. It&#39;s not a difficult concept. It&#39;s one they used to teach people my age when were kids: Sticks and stones may break your bones, but names will never hurt you. I feel for you if mommy and daddy never taught you that. </p>

<p>Again, stop misrepresenting me. You&#39;re just showing yourself for who you really are. I&#39;ve never once defended the Nazi ideology.

<p>Inciting a panic by yelling &quot;bomb&quot; or &quot;fire&quot; or making a credible threat towards a public figure is in no way, shape, or form comparable to having racist opinions and voicing them in a public forum.</p>

<p>The only thing I&#39;m claiming is that racist opinions are protected by free speech (they are, this is a demonstrable fact) and that we must protect free speech. Once you ban the speech of a group because of it&#39;s hateful content, it paves the way for the banning of any speech for <em>insert reason here</em>. </p>

<p>Jusr because I&#39;m defending the right of free speech does not mean I&#39;m defending the thoughts of fucking Nazis.</p>

<p>Furthermore, really? My mom? Ever hear of ad hominem? Ironically I was reading this thread on long commute and asked her opinion on the matter. Guess what, she, as well as most logical individuals, especially Americans, agree that free speech, even racist speech, should not a punishable offence under the law. </p>

<p>But oh wait, you&#39;re from the south! I guess I&#39;m wrong!</p>

<p>When you believe in the destruction of the very foundations of humanity then no, you don&#39;t have a right to jack shit.</p>

<p>Yes, but here&#39;s the point.  The fascists want you to see <strong><em>them</em></strong> as the exception.  They want you to see <strong><em>them</em></strong> as the enemy.  They don&#39;t care if you fight them or hang some of them; they know damn well that the moment they can get you to <strong><em>think like them</em></strong>, even if it is <strong><em>against them</em></strong>, then they have won.  You are now one of them yourself.</p>

<p>This is also why self-defense can never be a valid argument.  Fascists want a scenario where war is a central element of society; so again, they don&#39;t care who you are fighting, just as long as you are fighting <strong><em>someone,</em></strong> because as long as you are fighting <strong><em>someone</em></strong>, then you are like them.  </p>

<p>They desperately want to convert you, and they are sufficiently desperate about it, that they don&#39;t care what it costs them to do so, even if you end up killing them.  If they can&#39;t do that by speaking to you directly, then they will do it by using the negative characteristics of your own psychology against you.</p>

<p>Remember:-  If you advocate killing <strong><em>anyone</em></strong>, for <strong><em>any</em></strong> reason, then you are already a fascist.  You are already one of them.  They have already won.</p>

<p>I&#39;d like to suggest that you conduct an experiment.  Find a powerful form of antidepressant, (one which is known to neutralise virtually all emotion) take a dose of it, and then wait until you are under its&#39; effects.  Once you&#39;ve done that, rethink your position here; and do so from the basis of asking whether or not you would want someone else to grant the right of free expression to you.  See what you come up with.</p>

<p>I am not going to try and tell you that I am right and you are wrong.  I am not going to scream at you.  I know that the only way anyone can ever prove anything, is by proving it to themselves; so if you&#39;re willing, do it.  Strip yourself of your emotion as much as you can, and then look at the issue purely in terms of what outcome B would be, if action A were taken.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Personally, I appreciate it when racists tell me that they are racists. It&#39;s good to know that about people. I don&#39;t want to take away their free speech. I want everyone to know how they want to express themselves. In my experience, the most effective way to get people behind racism is when they don&#39;t realize it&#39;s racist. When the racism is unapologetic, people will recognize it for the evil it is. </p>

<p>When I hear people trying to silence racists, it makes me think that they&#39;re either bad actors or idiots. Only good reason I could think to suppress a racists&#39; free speech is if you think they make a compelling argument. Only reason to silence a racist is if you have no faith in people understanding that bigotry is wrong. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>in the end its a tough decision for me, if shit hits the fan I have no choice but to attempt to ally with the white nationalists and simply lie about my heritage to them (and possibly betray them down the line before they kill me)</p>

<p>it isn&#39;t even like I personally want that, but if it ends up with someone trying to genocide me, they better be ready for chemical warfare.</p>

<p>I have empathy, for anyone whom is my ally, but anyone who isn&#39;t is a raw demon unworthy of life without a soul in my eyes. I feel the same they do, in that if I get attacked, I will defend myself beyond what is considered reasonable force.</p>

<p>bathtub chemistry and technology are my weapons. not guns. and I wouldn&#39;t care if I fucked someone mentally for life rather than killing them, either.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>shrooms can be done rather easily, all you really have to do is watch for black mold and throw away anything that isn&#39;t covered in fully white mold.</p>

<p>Ive done this too lol. drying them is actually the difficult part (as sitting them out will ruin them you need sterile dessicant)</p>

<p>a pressure cooker is preferred, but you can just use mason jars and boil them like a double boiler, with the caps loosely on to allow in steam.</p>

<p>the thing is, it does affect your yield, since that way, more specimens end up being contaminated...</p>

<p>at that point, you just, like I said, watch for the black mold, or ANY color other than the white mold.</p>

<p>other colors will not necessarily be toxic (black will every time), but they COULD be, doesn&#39;t matter if red, green, etc.</p>

<p>the mold that grows the shrooms themselves, is solid white</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t mind me asking, what else have you dabbled in? I remember reading once that the ingredients for LSD are watched heavily, so purchasers are monitored.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>well, its easier to say what I haven&#39;t done. I haven&#39;t done PCP, or ketamine. almost everything else, I have tried, barring some research chemicals and obscure semi-legal substances.</p>

<p>from crack to dope (and both at the same time!), to everything else. I only ever really got hooked on dope.</p>

<p>in a little bit I&#39;m gonna be whacked out of it on DXM. I just drank like, 250mg. I really cant be sticking around the conspiracy sub though because I should keep myself in a positive mood once I come up.</p>

<p>getting all psychotically pissed at stuff isn&#39;t really a great experience lol.</p>

<p>itd be easier if you had any questions in specific drugs.</p>

<p>yes, the precursors to LSD are all watched, which is why I would never try to make LSD. if your trying to make that, usually its a bunch of college professor buddies whom each start a research project using one of those precursors, and each get a tiny bit extra, then they link up and share them all..</p>

<p>its still really hard, you can even order them all online, but they keep you on a list, and I don&#39;t think when you order it matters, you could order them months apart and still get a knock on your door.</p>

<p>what people who aren&#39;t doctors/professors have to do, is to use potentially dangerous household chemicals in order to refine them into what they need.</p>

<p>I mentioned DEET because DEET bugspray contains a peptide coupler which is but one of the precursors used in a variety of substances, including but not limited to LSD.</p>

I never actually let myself do anything that stupid to get in trouble ever. ive had my nose clean for years, even though my stomachs full of legal cough syrup and I&#39;m blitzed out of my skull right now.</p>

<p>its legal to talk and read about chemistry in the united states, its just not legal to practice or perform anything that you aren&#39;t supposed to obviously.</p>

<p>You could have a whole classroom lecture on the synthesis of LSD-25 if your professor wanted to. its just not legal to actually do it, and I seriously, highly would not recommend that.</p>

<p>I would never ever personally recommend performing any extractions upon plants which you know contain scheduled substances, because in the event you do it is highly illegal.</p>

<p>but you can easily read all about it online.</p>

<p>and that, for the most part, is the most I truly know.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>you know man, I don&#39;t really hate anyone. honestly, I hate myself. I&#39;m quite depressed most times, and I&#39;m kinda losing it. </p>

<p>Its been especially mentally rough for me, because ive tried to quit doing drugs, and my minds all fucked.</p>

<p>I kinda have a moment of clarity here, fucked up on DXM, personally, I overreact when I&#39;m &#39;sober&#39; because my brains all fucked from years of abuse. I&#39;m trying to get better, I guess.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t really hate anyone personally. I just get scared with so many people hating so much. I mean like fuck. I&#39;m just here, and I kind of don&#39;t even want to be.</p>

<p>I&#39;m definitely going to lose my mind, a lot of bad shit Is happening in my life. I keep trying to stop myself from going off the deep end personally. but I don&#39;t know. I&#39;m just kinda tired of life.</p>

<p>I impose this dark, grim, terrifying view on everything, because I&#39;m reflecting the hatred of myself. I stopped caring a long time ago, because too late, came and went, and somewhere, deep inside, I already knew that.</p>

<p>there was no path back to sanity, only the eternal now. only in moments like this, dissociated from my own mind can I really look at it for what it is, at least in myself, that sparks me to say crazy ass shit.</p>

<p>really, I just want to get better, id like to wake up and be able to handle my own mind, and emotions, without constantly drugging myself to cope with reality.</p>

<p>such talent and intellect I&#39;ve wasted, probably many will never understand.</p>

<p>I find myself constantly living in a past that&#39;s dead, reliving my past. pretending I&#39;m still there, where it seems.. somewhat safer, and to me, more interesting. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t even know who I am, or what exactly I am anymore.</p>

<p>And I mean, yeah, I know right now I&#39;m fucked out of my mind, </p>

<p>but even when I come down, I&#39;m not sure what I&#39;m coming down to anymore.</p>

<p>and a real recovery is going to be quite the long and grueling process.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know why I gave the rant,</p>

<p>but to be honest, its the true explanation of my, personal behavior lately. Ive burnt a few burner accounts on here, </p>

<p>but really, I&#39;m just a sad person, trying to find a way to sanity in insane times, that tend to aggravate my already poor mental stability.</p>

<p>I mean, I&#39;m pretty smart, for a complete psycho failure of a human being. You really could kinda think of me as a real life version of rick, from rick and morty.</p>

<p>except for the fact, that there is no interdimensional travel, or superintelligence. I&#39;m just some wasted asshole :p</p>

<p>free speech and hate speech are different things.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, they are not.  </p>

<p><strong><em>Hate speech does not exist.</em></strong>  </p>

<p>You can scream at me in response as much as you like; it won&#39;t prove anything.  The only practical use of the term &quot;hate speech,&quot; is to prevent someone from saying something; and it is a purely emotional and subjective term.  It has no proveable definition, and I don&#39;t care what psychopathic legislation you want to quote back to me in response to that, either.  Hitler made Germany&#39;s laws say whatever he wanted them to.</p>

<p>I will not tolerate a single exception to the right of free speech.  Not a single one.  Not &quot;terrorism,&quot; not &quot;hate speech,&quot; not &quot;racism,&quot; not child porn.  <strong><em>Nothing.</em></strong>  The reason why is because I know that totalitarianism relies on such exceptions for its&#39; very existence.  Totalitarianism can not exist in a scenario where no exceptions are granted to rules.  Totalitarianism relies on the acceptance of different people being treated in different ways, rather than the central rule that you do not treat anyone else in any manner in which you would not want to be treated yourself.</p>

<p>There is no compromise here.  There can be none.  We will either have freedom or we will not; and if we have &quot;hate speech,&quot; then we will not.  If you care more about being in a scenario where no one has their feelings hurt than being in a provably free society, then that is your perogative, but I do not share it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I totally respect your ideas, but this shit has happened before and the results were disastrous and led to the deaths of millions of people. There is nothing innocent or acceptable about hate speech and the outcome of not speaking back and having people understand that this is wrong and any modern society should not accept this. We have standards for a reason and this is like any other health or safety issue. We cannot have people gathering to spread the hate and destruction of other people in our communities. Would we allow a group of hitmen to gather and plan the deaths of millions of people? Then why should we allow people with the singular vision of eradicating other human beings gather together and propagate these ideas. I&#39;m sorry but this isn&#39;t a freedom of speech issue. This is a stand up against the tyranny of men and freedom issue. </p>

<p>as you see, this never fucking ends. if you silence one group, you merely grant the others unlimited power to stomp on them before continuing the fight amongst themselves when there is no longer anyone in the first disenfranchised group, to take status and position away from.</p>

<p>this is why I constant point at the elite who have far too fucking much, we could possibly at least lengthen our time here if we focused anger on them instead of each other.</p>

<p>maybe even long enough to actually create some semblance of egalitarianism -- you know, since the first generation of elites will be happy with benefits such as great normal mate selection (no sex slaves), less mansions, loyalty to one&#39;s roots, etc.</p>

<p>sure, it&#39;ll probably just descend into hedonism again eventually, but that time of an elite accepting less could allow us to educate ourselves, rebuild, and actually work on socioeconomic capabilities without it being such a dogfight and so unfair for awhile.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is important to keep alive! Always fight the good fight!</p>

<p>There are many people who have the talent to bring people from extreme views to a more middle area but how often do you see this on the internet or on the street? You have people with extreme, very unreflected views and discussions turn into a pissing contest. People don&#39;t want to understand your or the other view, for some unknown reason. There are hardly questions asked and when it happens they get rarely answered, because of the fear, when answered truthfully, it could be used as an argument against you and you lost being RIGHT and WINNING the &quot;discussion&quot;.</p>

<p>Discussion culture on reddit with the up/downvote dynamic is one of the poorest things I&#39;ve ever witnessed on the internet as it always leads to extremism.</p>

<p>And the funneled extremism has reached critical mass in society as nearly everyone is connected. And only those, truly angry, mobilize to go on the streets, finding their place in a group with some kind of extreme view. As long as the sheeps flock to the wolves who cry of some better world with hatespeech in either side there is nothing to win.</p>

<p>I still wait for change in your country but it&#39;s not happening. There is no interest in reducing the military budget, playing less world police, reducing overall debt, regulate wallstreet, regulate the federal reserve, etc... Those are things to go on the street. These are discussions worth having. If you just scream about whose ideology is right, it&#39;s just the worst kind of circle jerk and our ancestors didn&#39;t die for the freedom of speech to enable these kind of idiotic views. They would have expected the general public to &quot;calm&quot; those masses and naturally counter-act them with our freedom of speech. But that is not what is happening as extremist groups are gathering but the general public has no time for them. They oppose them, but they don&#39;t <em>really</em> oppose them on the streets or in discussions. Most are passive.</p>

<p>And all this works with only a handful of people that completely derail ANYTHING imaginable! As long as those few individuals can do as they please and they are not opposed by the general public they will <em>feel</em> important and like a huge mass but they aren&#39;t.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve never believed in the concept of &quot;hate speech,&quot; personally.  I also don&#39;t believe in any exception whatsoever to the right of freedom of expression; and I tend to think that the only people who behave in ways which encourage said exceptions (such as shouting &quot;fire&quot; or hitting fire alarms in theaters) are doing so precisely because they want the right of free expression to be destroyed.</p>

<p>At the same time, I am not opposed to calling neo-Nazis hypocrites, and reminding them of the fact that, while they might be screaming about the right of free expression when they are prevented from speaking, there is no way whatsoever that they would grant the same right to their own opponents.</p>

<p>Democracy is morally extremely fragile.  The reason why is because it relies on neutrality and the idea that people consciously agree to grant other people the same rights which they want themselves.  We live in a period of time where this idea of universal reciprocity has completely broken down.  Both sides will condone anything if it is their own side engaging in it, and condemn anything if it is the other side doing it.  Moral consistency is not a priority; total destruction of the perceived enemy is.</p>

<p>I do not consider myself on anyone&#39;s side.  The Left claim that there is no moral equivalency between themselves and white supremacists, while the Right likewise claim that there is no moral equivalency between themselves and Muslims.  The only way we are going to resolve anything, is if we let go of our craving to utterly dehumanise whoever we view as the enemy, and create rationalisations as to how it is supposedly morally legitimate for said enemy to be destroyed.</p>

<p>Again, we need to stop <strong><em>wanting</em></strong> to view ourselves as holy and the other side as monsters, and the egoic payoff which we derive from doing that.  If we want the conflict to end, <strong><em>someone</em></strong> is going to have to be willing to consciously look out over No Man&#39;s Land at the people on the other side; and someone on said other side is going to have to be willing to look back.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is perfectly fine to be both against violent extremists on either side, and also agree that they have the same rights to free speech without violence as anyone else.  Fascist regimes silence dissenters.  Taking away constitutional rights from people you don&#39;t agree with is a slippery slope, because eventually it will be used against a cause you care about.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>GOOD QUESTION</p>

<p>for anyone who grew up in this country and wasn&#39;t born yesterday, this guy running his car through people and the media spectacle are the functional reason why nazis are now being censored and called &#39;terrorists&#39; all over the country just for their ideas</p>

<p>if i had to choose between israel and the klan, I would have to think very hard, because the two are different forms of the same thing</p>

<p>yet at this moment, israel can do whatever it wants including getting this idiotic BDS censorship bill, TO THE TOP OF CONGRESSES DOCKET </p>

<p>What the fuck? You actually believe this? </p>

<p>Nazis have every fucking right to say what they want (within the law). They have no right to act on their speech. The same thing holds true for muslims and Sharia Law. Stop equating speech with action. </p>

<p>This path we&#39;re heading down.. the one you&#39;re helping us head down with this rhetoric, is beyond fucking dangerous. </p>

<p>Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out—<br/>

<p>Then they came for me—and there was no one left to speak for me.</p>

<p>I&#39;d like to suggest that you conduct an experiment.  Find a powerful form of antidepressant, (one which is known to neutralise virtually all emotion) take a dose of it, and then wait until you are under its&#39; effects.  Once you&#39;ve done that, rethink your position here; and do so from the basis of asking whether or not you would want someone else to grant the right of free expression to you.  See what you come up with.</p>

<p>I am not going to try and tell you that I am right and you are wrong.  I am not going to scream at you.  I know that the only way anyone can ever prove anything, is by proving it to themselves; so if you&#39;re willing, do it.  Strip yourself of your emotion as much as you can, and then look at the issue purely in terms of what outcome B would be, if action A were taken.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>if your willing to murder and or silence all these groups I am all for it but it has to be ALL OF THEM OR NONE OF THEM:</p>

<p>white supremacists, black supremacists (Malcom X should be considered a nazi), muslim supremacists, Asian supremacists, tranny supremacists, feminist supremacists, masculinist supremicists, etc.</p>

<p>as you see, this never fucking ends. if you silence one group, you merely grant the others unlimited power to stomp on them before continuing the fight amongst themselves when there is no longer anyone in the first disenfranchised group, to take status and position away from.</p>

<p>I totally agree, in a sense... if we could murder the entire support base of all these groups in one day, and leave the rest of mankind to be gods of their domain in some sense of true egalitarian equality.</p>

<p>I would be all for it.</p>

<p>but silencing only &quot;Approved&quot; groups, does absolutely nothing in the long run, and only hurts innocent people in the short run.</p>
