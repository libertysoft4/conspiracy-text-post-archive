<p>Dude, this is 4chan saying there was a &quot;switcheroo&quot; based on the shit doxx they did of that innocent kid in Michigan. It&#39;s basically 4chan being doubly retarded. </p>

<p>That&#39;s a set of photos of the arrest of James Alex Fields. 4chan is confused because they were expecting that young kid Joel from Michigan. Because 4chan is very stupid.</p>

<p>Did you even watch the video? </p>

<p>Beginning clearly shows the driver was braking (red lights on the back of the vehicle) after going over the speed bump. By the time the camera pans left, the driver is clearly moving slowly and letting the crowd disburse in front of him. He was certainly not accelerating. </p>

<p>The video clearly shows a man in a white shirt swinging a flag into the back of the car. Keep in mind, this was a the time when the car wasn&#39;t moving fast at all. After the flag bash, the driver freaks out and accelerates, probably trying to get away from the mob behind him with baseball bats. </p>

<p>Did you even watch the video? </p>

<p>Beginning clearly shows the driver was braking (red lights on the back of the vehicle) after going over the speed bump. By the time the camera pans left, the driver is clearly moving slowly and letting the crowd disburse in front of him. He was certainly not accelerating. </p>

<p>The video clearly shows a man in a white shirt swinging a flag into the back of the car. Keep in mind, this was a the time when the car wasn&#39;t moving fast at all. After the flag bash, the driver freaks out and accelerates, probably trying to get away from the mob behind him with baseball bats. </p>
