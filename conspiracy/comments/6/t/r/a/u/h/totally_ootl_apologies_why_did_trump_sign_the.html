<p>is there another level of stuff going on w/ russia?</p>

<p>i&#39;m so confused.</p>

<p>i&#39;d be grateful if you could plz point me towards info.</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>edit</strong>: ok, I get that the bills had a majority and would have passed whether or not trump signed them, but why pass sanctions? is all of congress in on this? why did republicans vote for it?</p>

<p>lol. i feel like i just found out that santa claus isn&#39;t real.</p>

<hr/>

<p><del>ALSO: is this why the N. Korea stuff blew up all of a sudden?</del></p>

<p>i looked at the timeline more closely and sorted out that the missile test was July 30, before the sy hersh recording was public.</p>

<p>For interfering in the 2016 elections, and for invading Georgia and Ukraine.  The primary purpose of the bill was to eliminate Trump&#39;s ability to remove these previously imposed sanctions without Congressional approval. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks.  :P  Nah, I am unemployed (left my IT job because they thought breaks were optional for me) and the <strong><em>only</em></strong> people trying to save this country are those SSN people/sovereigns.  The funny thing is everyone dismisses them but they&#39;ve done their homework and uncovered where this country went wrong, plus they have setup this country to run after the fraud that we call a government is brought down; not to mention taken steps to recapture the country while the government fell into bankruptcy again recently.  Yet, everyone just points and laughs at them...even conspiracy people.  I did it for almost a decade before I gave them a chance.  Now that I got all that out, I will tell you another thing since you&#39;re so flattering and/or accurate with most of your assessment of me.  </p>

<p>Harvey Dent, Mike O&#39;Brien, MOOR, Anna Von Reitz, many others and I have put our necks on the line to challenge the validity of this fraudulent corporation called USA, Inc.  We are all going to end up locked up in cages for decades each unless people start at least seriously looking at this, and you will have all missed out on your chance to save this country before they turn it into a transhumanist borg style farm.</p>

<p>We directly challenged the federal government, the banks, the retail corporations with a show of unity.  We had some real success but they unleashed the trolls and now the family is struggling.  I have spent my whole life looking for my reason for being, being 42 years of age now.  I have found my purpose as a member of the first group of truthful Americans, born and living in flesh and blood on the homeland of my birth, to make an authentic patriotic action on behalf of &quot;the People&quot;.  </p>

<p>I am so thankful for the truly wonderful life I have been blessed to live, no matter what happens.  We are out there folks, non-partisan and operating purely from the love of our country and our fellow man.  We are trying to liberate you from the invisible chains placed on you from birth, but we cannot do it without all of you.</p>

<p>Please, pass this along to everyone you know because I don&#39;t know how much more time they&#39;re going to give us before we end up in some cage, unlawfully subjected to the tyranny of the law of the sea on our own native land (yes, my greatx2 grandfather was a Cherokee chief).  The conspiracy is too large to bother trying to unravel in the little time I will have your attention, but I will ask you this if you deny what I am saying.  How many Constitutions does this country have?</p>

<p>Close. I knew you sat at a computer all day and knew too much. Security? Maybe even working on government contracts?</p>

<p>They&#39;re not wrong, in terms of some of the insane legal fictions being used right now. The problem is choice of tactics. You WILL get arrested trying most of these things.</p>

<p>A better tactical approach would be to crack open the blackmail networks. Get enough dirt on enough high level people, and they can&#39;t touch you. You could also look at asymetrical warfare stuff.</p>

<p>At a bare minimum, you need to look at more subversive communications methods.</p>

<p>Sounds like you want to save the world. High Level Insider is the only person I&#39;ve ever seen give concrete strategic and tactical answers to solve that problem.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ve gone far down the rabbit hole. It&#39;s just that this is uncovering the method for the con. Not the method for ending the con.</p>

<p>Empty and misleading words again. I kind of doubt you have actually read the threads. You have simply <em>nothing</em> concrete to defend your statements regarding HLI:</p>

<p>Obvious Answer: They are all working together.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So why did he issue this statement?</p>

<p><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/08/02/statement-president-donald-j-trump-signing-hr-3364">https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/08/02/statement-president-donald-j-trump-signing-hr-3364</a></p>

<p>&quot;Today, I have signed into law H.R. 3364, the &quot;Countering America&#39;s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act.&quot;  While I favor tough measures to punish and deter aggressive and destabilizing behavior by Iran, North Korea, and Russia, this legislation is significantly flawed.</p>

<p>In its haste to pass this legislation, the Congress included a number of clearly unconstitutional provisions.  For instance, although I share the policy views of sections 253 and 257, those provisions purport to displace the President&#39;s exclusive constitutional authority to recognize foreign governments, including their territorial bounds, in conflict with the Supreme Court&#39;s recent decision in Zivotofsky v. Kerry.</p>

<p>Additionally, section 216 seeks to grant the Congress the ability to change the law outside the constitutionally required process.  The bill prescribes a review period that precludes the President from taking certain actions.  Certain provisions in section 216, however, conflict with the Supreme Court&#39;s decision in INS v. Chadha, because they purport to allow the Congress to extend the review period through procedures that do not satisfy the requirements for changing the law under Article I, section 7 of the Constitution.  I nevertheless expect to honor the bill&#39;s extended waiting periods to ensure that the Congress will have a full opportunity to avail itself of the bill&#39;s review procedures.</p>

<p>Further, certain provisions, such as sections 254 and 257, purport to direct my subordinates in the executive branch to undertake certain diplomatic initiatives, in contravention of the President&#39;s exclusive constitutional authority to determine the time, scope, and objectives of international negotiations.  And other provisions, such as sections 104, 107, 222, 224, 227, 228, and 234, would require me to deny certain individuals entry into the United States, without an exception for the President&#39;s responsibility to receive ambassadors under Article II, section 3 of the Constitution.  My Administration will give careful and respectful consideration to the preferences expressed by the Congress in these various provisions and will implement them in a manner consistent with the President&#39;s constitutional authority to conduct foreign relations.</p>

<p>Finally, my Administration particularly expects the Congress to refrain from using this flawed bill to hinder our important work with European allies to resolve the conflict in Ukraine, and from using it to hinder our efforts to address any unintended consequences it may have for American businesses, our friends, or our allies.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;When — not if — the Global Currency Reset occurs, the world will return to a “asset backed” system. For example, currency baskets will obtain gold, silver, oil, corn, cotton or whatever resources prove valuable. This will enable each country’s currency to be “pegged” to a new value.&quot;</p>

<p>More money magic. Riiight.</p>
