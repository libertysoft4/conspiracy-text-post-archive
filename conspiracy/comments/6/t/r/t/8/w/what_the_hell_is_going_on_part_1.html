        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><strong>Where are we now?</strong></p>

<p>If you&#39;ve been paying much attention to the world of late, you may have noticed that things have gotten pretty bad. Regardless of what we are referring to specifically – the <em>state of the world</em>, the <em>human condition</em>, the potential of our <em>future as a race of beings</em> – everything seems to be in quite the state of chaos and disarray. The <em>human animal</em> seems to be rapidly changing, but the term <em>evolving</em> does not feel appropriate to describe any of the changes. The structures and institutions in our societies no longer serve the functions of the populous, but function structurally upon the populous, changing humanity into what we are witnessing <em>right now</em>. These <em>changes</em> we are undergoing as a species are phenomenal, and on some levels unprecedented in human history. On other levels, what we are witnessing is resultant of the continuation of structures and control methods that have been in place for literally thousands of years; the final bricks of the pyramid being put into place. </p>

<p>Humanity&#39;s rich history of recording our representations in paintings and sculptures betray a clear <em>missing link</em> between humanity&#39;s <em>past and future</em> in the character of <em>Homer Simpson</em>. Before the appearance of <em>Homer Simpson</em> in 1987, there are simply no representations of <em>the contemporary Western human male form</em>. Even what has been now termed <em>male pattern baldness</em> can only be found sporadically in representation before the early nineteenth century, and seemingly confined to certain genealogies. While it may be argued that the invention of the camera around this time may account for more &quot;honesty&quot; in representations of the human male form than may have resulted from technologies with which idealisation of the form is more readily accomplished (as with sculpture and painting), it must also be noted that this period also coincides with the period of industrialisation that saw massive change in the way that humans lived, and with the introduction of regular exposure to chemicals and conditions created by industrialisation itself. </p>

<p>Prior to the introduction of <em>Homer Simpson</em> in 1987, the history of our art shows no representations of the form of <em>the contemporary Western human male</em> as we have come to know it today: the effeminised bowling pin silhouette with wider hips than shoulders, breasts that would excite any pubescent boy, and a body, hormonally, that is preparing for menopause. It would appear, in this instance, that life certainly imitates art, though, as <em>Homer Simpson</em> has provided the archetype which a large portion of the population have allowed themselves to be molded. This illustrates the next two important concepts we will be addressing: <em>archetypes</em> and <em>consent</em>.  </p>

<p><strong>Archetypes and Categories</strong></p>

<p>Human beings are inescapably categorical thinkers, and most disagreement that occurs between humans is of the categorical variety. The <em>larger</em> the category being discussed, the greater the opportunity for disagreement. A consummate example of this may be found in positions taken in regard to religion and theology, whereby those who agree on the definitions of a <em>larger</em> category are allowed the freedom within that category of maintaining disputes regarding <em>smaller subcategories</em>, and to maintain those disputes without animosity. Conversely, those of opposing positions regarding the <em>larger</em> categories of faith will have no opportunity to even consider the smaller categories from cross positions, as witnessed in every single religious dispute throughout human history. </p>

<p>Further, categorical thinking is <em>essentially</em> relational, and lends itself naturally toward a substitutive or algebraic logic which then tends to be the underlying <em>pattern</em> for human cognition and the structuring of relations. This is the process through which <em>metaphor</em> gains its gargantuan power to influence our <em>realities</em>, both conceptually and actually. <em>Metaphors</em>, while linguistic in qualia, derive their systematic rationale not through language itself (through the literal definitions of the terms employed by the metaphor used), but through embodied experience and the cognition of that embodied experience, with almost all language we employ accoutered by metaphors of human embodiment and activity. Metaphor is not a matter of words, but of concepts drawn directly from lived experience. Metaphors function by partially structuring one experience in terms of another, in effort to structure abstract or personal experiences in terms of more concrete or communally shared ones. Metaphors function far beyond linguistic expression and instead structure and influence the human conceptual system; constituting our worldviews, and resonating both our personal subjectivity and our shared conceptions of human experience <em>as humans</em>. Metaphors are entirely conceptual, and are structured, and function, through conceptual inference. Metaphors allow us to use what we know about our experience with the world subjectively as a (metaphoric) tool for drawing inferences in other domains that are less concrete and not grounded in direct, communicably accessible experiences (love, life, justice, etc.).</p>

<p>And metaphors are <em>entirely</em> categorical. Algebraic or substitutive reasoning is the uninfluenced form taken within categorical thinking, and it has several flaws to its process that deserve consideration. Substitutive categorical reasoning is <em>always</em> trapped within the confines of its own paradigm – and without antithetical propositions it is simply blind to its own limitations or incoherencies. Without serious methodological adjustment, such categorical substitutive reasoning leads to a proliferation of what <em>Donald Rumsfeld</em> famously termed <em>unknown unknowns</em>. Within this cognitive and relational framework, the metaphors that will naturally be adopted will be those that reinforce the paradigm itself, further frustrating any attempts to interpret the world through any other possible framework. </p>

<p>Modern society relies intimately on these structural <em>tendencies</em> of human cognition, and goes all out to amplify this effect for the purposes for social control through division and conquer. One of the more powerful tools in their arsenal I like to call <em>The Breakfast Club</em>; the creation of predefined archetypes positioned throughout the <em>kulture kreation komplex</em> for members of society to simply <em>choose between</em> in the creation and formation of their own identities. Pre- early nineteenth century industrialisation, identity formation <em>used to</em> operate very differently for humans than it does today: people lived primarily within family units, which were then part of larger communities created and defined by weather, geography and praxis. Within such an environment, personal identities were formed <em>in concert</em> with others, and in response not simply to the daily patterns and customs of life, but in <em>mistakes made</em>. In such an environment, mistakes – social or otherwise – cannot be ignored, and instead function as the formative basis for personal identity formation. </p>

<p>As we know from the work of Lacan, the process of a human coming to understand themselves as <em>an I among other I&#39;s</em> is a drawn out process of discovery in stages. At first, the child&#39;s grasp of <em>self</em> extends to the breast, and it is some time before the child discovers that it is in fact separate from the breast, and from the mother. At some point there will be some small episode of lashing out against the mother (against the proper <em>owner</em> of the breast once thought to be a part of the child), though it will not be until the child is able to comprehend its own reflection (and possibly grasp the concept of the number <em>four</em>) that it will come to understand itself as <em>an I among other I&#39;s</em>. In pre-industrialised identity formation, we find further stages of cultural, social and personal development beyond the work of Lacan, in the creation of a socially shared communal rationality and culture.</p>

<p>Within family and local community environments, individuals are structurally obligated to continue this process of <em>discovery</em> in the formation of their own personal identities in concert with others, and in response to developmental challenges. In these processes, the daily routine of culture is less formative than instances of aberration against the culture and society, and it is through these social and cultural erratum that personalities are formed, rather than adopted in archetype. Individuals within these social environments would still look to others <em>as archetypes</em> in one sense, as children imitate their elders, but their <em>conception of themselves</em> (as <em>an I among other I&#39;s</em>) would be a socially <em>shared</em> construct developed in conjunction with others, and through interaction with others. That mistakes are made, <em>and are forgiven</em>, is the underlying basis of human society and natural identity formation processes. </p>

<p>In contrast to this, we have seen, since the mid-twentieth century particularly, a drastic shift in the cultural and social processes of identity formation; a phenomenon which must be understood coextensively with the proliferation of new media technologies. We will be discussing these technologies extensively as we progress. </p>

<p><strong>Who are we?</strong></p>

<p>Who we are is everything. All of our thoughts, experiences, perceptions, aspirations, and actions – collective and specific, cultural and biological – follow from who we are. <em>“Who am I?”</em> is reliant for its bearings on <em>“What are we?”</em> The importance of this process of identity formation operates simultaneously in two directions; to the personal, and to the external, where representations accumulate and interact to become culture, with personal identity formation simultaneously structured within <em>“cultures of representation”</em>. Who we are is a function of what we are, and where we are. As <em>“emergent phenomena within nature”</em> nature provides <em>the forms</em> (if you will) for what culture seeks to become as a representation. Human culture, as a representative form, is embedded in the <em>processes</em> of being human; that is, from being born and perceiving the world (and existent culture) through the same five senses, learning representations and mistaking them, and learning from mistakes. </p>

<p>The task of culture – indeed, the possibility of it – arises from the coherency we find in nature, and our intrinsic understanding and acceptance of natural forms of semiosis and the processes of (our own) existence. Simply asking <em>“How am I here?”</em> relies, for every possible argument, on identifying natural, or pre-existent (pre-cultural) teleological semiosis. It is the coherency that can be found in natural forms of semiosis that set our representations and culture with the task of seeking coherency as we seek to define who we are. In the same way that a sunflower, by its actions becomes capable of reproducing another sunflower, and by its relationship to the sun in this process becomes a representamen of the sun, so too does culture, knowledge and the human project itself reproduce its own likeness and behaviours, effectively not only becoming a representamen of nature, but forming the interpretive and discursive sets through which signs may be taken and formed.  </p>

<p>The relationship of effect between coherency and incoherency is vastly different in nature than in culture. Incoherencies open up possibilities for development (and from this, continuation) within culture specifically because it is never fully formed, and is reliant on adequate perceptions and interpretations. Nature, however, encounters incoherencies as stumps in progression, being already fully formed (and through this formation of systemics, invested with meaning). Cultural or not, as beings <em>within</em> this system, as <em>“emergent phenomena within nature,”</em> who we are, our conception of ourselves does not only influence our relationship with nature and the external – it <em>is</em> our relationship with the external, and our legitimacy within it. The process of personal identity formation (that is, localised instances) is informed by rites, mores, traditions and position-takings, all of which are resultant of stories – narratives – emergent from conglomerates of, and permutations between individuals and societies – different co-influential fields created and reinforced by shared experiences and perceptions. In this, culture can be seen as hereditary perceptual sets which influence and reinforce their own particularities through positive feedback loops of interpretation and explanation of experience. </p>

<p>We can see this played out in the history of science, where on many occasions throughout, true progress has been held back by predefined and reinforced perceptual and interpretive sets. The most glaring example comes from the influence of Aristotle whose ideas fundamentally hampered scientific progress for some two thousand years. A master logician, Aristotle’s teachings were all taken to be true, with the intellectual capital earned through logical argument in one field being equally attributed to all other fields which he wrote on the topics of. Not until close to two millennia later did Galileo challenge his ideas (risking his reputation in doing so) on such things as the effects of gravity on falling objects and the position of the earth as the centre of the universe. By the time he had conducted experiments dropping objects of varying mass from the Tower of Pisa, Galileo had already been expelled from the University of Pisa for questioning Aristotle’s authority on such matters. In human biology, Aristotle’s heart-centred view of physiology maintained dominance until the sixteenth century, holding that “the brain is an organ of minor importance, perhaps necessary to cool the blood.” In the field of botany, his views that plants were not divided into sexes dominated until the eighteenth century. While a contemporary of Aristotle, Democritus, put forward the position that matter was composed of tiny particles he termed atoms, this idea only surfaced again in the late seventeenth century due to the influence of Aristotle’s teachings. </p>

<p><strong>A new type of person</strong></p>

<p>New media technologies and the purposes they are put toward are contributing to the distortion of spatial and temporal referents, and their legitimacy. The advent of writing and alphabetic literacy functioned to drastically restructure consciousness, initiating new ways of thinking and remembering, list making, and fostered complex analytic thought. In a world of meaning dominated by sign systems, the phonetically representative system of signs led to the deification of the word, with authority anointed through left-justified formality. Written statements came to be a preferred method of record keeping, ending the tradition of pre-eminence given to witness accounts, and the verbal recounting of one’s ancestor’s account, a very specific history. </p>

<p>The change and development of media technologies have served to bring about change in the methods and systems of interpretation within humans. The justified print of the newspaper, with information contained to the very edge of its presence on the paper, had the effect of declaring through its systems of signs that it contained <em>all</em> the news, and was complete. New media technologies are having the effect of distorting the functions (and associated referents) of time and space, and are totally devoid of relationships of reference with the receiver (the relationship, for example, of an individual to the newspaper which s/he purchased). Whether consciously or unconsciously, the uses to which these emergent media technologies are put serve to replicate and reinforce the logic of consumer capitalism (and simultaneously, it must be noted, resist it). </p>

<p>To be human is to be situated already in our thinking and being within time; within <em>timelines</em>. The formation of personal identity, “biographical experience,” or “psychic life” is created (occurs) within chronological time and naratological unfolding, much like these sentences being written and read. The situatedness of human thinking by its very act contextualises itself. Narrative is not simply a progression of events, but also a story-teller and an audience to whom the story is told. But the nature of culture and personal identity formation operate in such a way that this discourse is occurring constantly and from many disparate positions. Historical narrative is told and conceptualized from within first the atomist position taking, then in its recounting is brought into the communal sphere of culture, where the natural functions of hermeneutic evolutions are corrupted and confounded by power relationships for cultural capital which can be gained through the manipulation of cultural dictates as a whole in a given direction. </p>

<p>The largest ramification of this is the creation of a <em>new type of person</em> being created by these emerging media technologies. Before 1944, there was <em>no such thing as a Teenager</em>. The entire categorical archetype was a creation of the media – which, from its inception has always been entirely under the control of government, and used to propagandise its own citizens and literally <em>create</em> their culture. The mid-1940&#39;s – much like the late 1980&#39;s – marks a rather incredible turning point for Western human culture in general, as this was when the Tavistock claws really tore into the flesh of human culture, creating the offerings of identity formation we witness today. In addition to generational categories whose sole purpose is to destabilise the family, we witness the introduction of <em>personality archetypes</em>, all cleverly designed to reinforce the culture being created in the manner we discussed earlier, in which metaphors that will naturally be adopted will be those that reinforce the paradigm itself, further frustrating any attempts to interpret the world through any other possible framework.  </p>

<p><strong>The Breakfast Club</strong></p>

<p>In the 1980&#39;s, a guy called <em>John Hughes</em> started making movies that subtly introduced relationships of pederasty <em>in an acceptable light</em>, and continued the trend started in the 1950&#39;s of sexualising children for family audiences. One of his larger successes in culture creation came in the form of a movie from 1985 called <em>The Breakfast Club</em>, in which (IMDb) <em>&quot;five high school students meet in Saturday detention and discover they have a lot more in common than they thought.&quot;</em> What was important about this movie, particularly, was the <em>archetypes</em> of the characters themselves; archetypes we have witnessed repeated <em>literally fucking ad nauseum</em> since. The jock, the princess, the brain, the weird kid, and the freak. </p>

<p>Now, it is not my interest to outright horrify you here, but if you look at the <em>culture</em> which surrounds you today, you will notice that every single positioned <em>talking head</em> falls into one of these categories. This is for a reason, and this is by design. And while I have been focusing on a narrative from the twentieth century, this is really little more than an extension of the idea of <em>surnames</em>, which were only introduced for taxation purposes, and were generally used to define the <em>type of work</em> you would do to benefit the state. This is why most surnames we have today refer to either some trade or physical characteristic genetically passed down and identifiable to tax collectors, or reference to a location where the family might be found, and taxes levied. </p>

<p>With the advent and proliferation of new media forms, we witness the emergence of a new <em>type of person</em> who <em>has no idea who s/he is</em>. Like Akira, this media has become ubiquitous in the lives of every citizen, and in most homes every chair faces the magic screen that is the largest propaganda arm of government. In so doing, it has wedged itself between <em>every living person in society</em>, and in between every relationship. The very understanding of the self has become entirely mediated by media to the degree that <em>people no longer form their own identities</em> in concert with others, but instead choose them, and try them on. Every single aspect of our culture is designed to reinforce this feedback loop, from fashion, to industrial design, to music, to cars, to laws, zoning and permissions given by the state. At every level of your interaction with your culture, you are expected to adhere to an appropriate archetype. </p>

<p>Further, these archetypes serve a purpose beyond just giving you a coke/pepsi selection to the uniform you choose to wear (all clothing is a uniform). These archetypes serve a very important function formatively upon the minds of people, while remaining <em>completely interchangeable at all times</em>. This is evident in all genre movies (movies, like music, are all entirely formulaic now, not a surprise considering where they really come from...); even within a <em>jock</em> movie, you will have these five archetypes represented <em>within the group of jocks</em> – it is an essential aspect of culture creation, to <em>always</em> have these predefined archetypes in some form as a means of influencing <em>position-taking</em>. </p>

<p>These archetypes function not only as <em>uniforms to try on</em> for the developing individual, as well as <em>identities to aspire to</em>, but as social conditioning and stratification tools and insinuated hierarchical relationships defined by the roles chosen. Through these <em>position-takings</em>, public sentiment can be defined and directed, and most importantly, discourse can be derailed at any time through division and conquer according to these categorical archetypes. As mentioned, these archetypes are dynamic and interchangeable, and what matters is not even so much which group one aspires to, but simply that they identify in some way with one of the archetypes offered, at least in part.  These archetypes are reinforced through memetic culture to become the basis of your social interactions with others, particularly with the simultaneous liberalisation of culture where you have to accept each person <em>for who they are</em> in spite of the fact that people just try to exceed one another competitively as to <em>who can be most archetypal</em> (as seen quite easily in street gangs and prison culture, led by the nose by the media). </p>

<p>These archetypes function as useful tools of division, where literally <em>any</em> discussion can be derailed along these <em>personality</em> lines and position-takings. <em>&quot;As a single mum with a daughter, I am offended by...&quot;</em> It is the primary role of the positioned <em>talking heads</em> to continually reinforce these points of division: to <em>frustrate discourse and communication about ideas</em>, and instead concentrate on these <em>entirely fabricated</em> categories we use to define ourselves in opposition to others, rather than in concert with them. As mentioned, this is also ubiquitous <em>across</em> archetypes, with the same divisions being found also within any social group or structure, a result of <em>life imitating art</em> (or propaganda working). </p>

<p>One reason this works so well is the illusion of choice offered at all times within such a construct. In reality these are simply useful categories from a social engineering perspective, and the weighted percentage of each category can be carefully crafted through manipulation of culture, as evidenced in rap music and gangster/prison culture, to create whatever social strata is desired by the creators of that culture. But central to all of this is not only <em>choice</em>, but <em>consent</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Consenting adults</strong></p>

<p>These sound like two very simple and straightforward words, and used together is likely a term that you arrived at this discussion with your own definition of, your own understanding. The true definition of these words – both legally and ontologically – is instead rather startling. The <em>law</em> we are really subject to, the law of piracy and ultimately of Rome, defines us all as <em>consenting adults</em> not for the reasons of definition you may think regarding the interactions between <em>two consenting adults</em>. We are all, in fact, <em>Homer Simpson</em>: a dolt through definition of our consent. We are the poisoned slave breeders, too stupid to recognise our positions of servitude let alone do anything about it. Instead, we <em>consent</em> to everything. We allow losers to lead us, and to rule over us. There are no <em>innocent bystanders</em> in this; only <em>consenting adults</em>. </p>

<p>Each and every member of our society is either a dolt, a sellout, or an admixture of the two (a <em>useful idiot</em> such as those who populate the ranks of most bureaucracies). In every sphere and specialisation within our society and its structures, the <em>&quot;experts&quot;</em> in charge are either incredibly stupid, absolutely corrupt, or a combination of both. </p>

<p>In dentistry we have the very large problem of fluoride. Even a few hours spent practicing google-fu on the topic of fluoride would have any right-thinking individual questioning the prevalence of it in our drinking water and a vast range of pharmacology. There is really not even any valid arguments from the &#39;official position&#39; side of the argument, which openly admits that fluoride is only beneficial to teeth in a very small developmental window, and even then only when applied topically (not ingested). So why do &#39;four out of five dentists recommend...&#39;? Dentists, being those invested with social capital as &#39;experts&#39; in their specialisation, you would think, would be among the most informed on the topic of fluoride in our society, and they tell us it is fine, drink the fucking water. And they are paid handsomely to do so. And after five or six years of college (with or without debt) and a manicured hand that feeds, who would be tempted to rock that luxury yacht?</p>

<p>Similar with doctors, who function not as healers, but as the point-of-sale merchants for corporate pharma. We see evidenced in such things as the DSM broadening definitions of official maladies to the point that suggests that everyone should in some way be medicated. While this obviously plays to the interests of big pharma, it is the <em>absolute responsibility</em> of those who have taken an oath to do no harm to police their own specialisation. But, again, who would rock that boat? When elevated to one of these positions of societal prominence by a structure, why would you personally undermine the foundations of that structure by raising pertinent questions?</p>

<p>And so it goes with lawyers and judges, each of whom quickly learns the corruption within our legal systems, and happily dons the priestly robes of that class to maintain the corrupt system, as beneficiaries. It is the responsibility of the individuals in these roles to do more than play the part assigned to them, but the system is maintained precisely by the acquiescence of each individual to accept their role in the litany of lies, rather than to speak out against or question that system and the roles they play within it. Our very democracy is proposed as the system which reflects and serves the will of the majority, and plainly such is not the case. Our democratic systems themselves have been constructed and designed in such a way as to prohibit the will of the people from influencing their own governance. And if the rabble get raucous? Some violence and lies will soon get them thanking their jailers and locking themselves back in their chosen cells.</p>

<p>And the system exists as it does precisely because we accept it as such. We allow laws to be passed which serve the interests of no <em>person</em> or <em>citizen</em> of the state. We allow the continuance of a system of selection rather than election of our so-called &#39;leaders&#39; who openly support the corporate person over the actual (cattle). We support this pyramid, each and every one of us. Even the laws of physics are taken to be variable since 91101, and for some reason many people just accept that. Time and again, complete fabrications have been the basis of virtually every change in human society: WMDs, Saddam, Muammar Al Qaddafi, Children Overboard... and that is not even mentioning any of the lies that have not been openly admitted to already, but have been uncovered nonetheless. </p>

<p>We allow this to happen. We not only let them lead us, we put on our own collars and hand them the lead. We do so by joining their conversations, rather than starting our own. Impossible physics are just that: impossible, and we should accept no person of learning who puts forward any explanations for anything which relies on impossible physics for their explanations. Nor should we accept the explanation of incompetence and stupidity always offered in place of admission of the true extent of corruption in all of these cultural and societal structures. &#39;Bad intelligence&#39; cannot be accepted as an explanation for carefully orchestrated deceptions. And if we are to accept that all of our selected leaders are in fact so incompetent and stupid as they are often shown to be to scapegoat the reality of the orchestration, then how in the fuck have these dregs of humanity made it into the positions of authority they have attained?</p>

<p>They have made it into those positions through <em>our consent</em>. We allow this to happen, and support the pyramid on top of us with every consensual rape we submit to daily. There are no innocent bystanders, we are each and every one guilty of our subservience to the systems that we know intuitively function only to enslave us. </p>

<p>So that is where we are now (well, part one anyway); part two will go into more specifics about how we are controlled through poisoning; semiotic and biological. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>deep, very well thought out, and contextualized. Kudos.</p>

<p>its gratifying to witness this time. that others are observing in this way, i feel better about  our current collextive works and tasks. OP are you familiar with the archetypal mind as outlined in the law of one? </p>

<p>I have found the study of archetypes to be extremely fruitful. in general terms. </p>

<p>I would imagine We are all doing our part to effect change. Thank you. those who are in the &quot;channel&quot; my deepest gratitude for the words and associations. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey OP, a lot of insightful and well thought out perspectives.  I recommend that you break it up into more parts (i.e. Posts) so that we can discuss the parts as they are presented.  Just my personal opinion.  Keep up the good work :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I skimmed this over admittedly but I agree with the gist of what I did see. It&#39;s disheartening for sure. We do not hold TPTB accountable, doubly so in America. We&#39;re too bogged down by technology; too distracted by fake media narratives pitting us all against one another because that takes our attention away from the real issues. We allow others to think for us because it&#39;s easier when we feel the squeeze from all the pressures of society.</p>

<p>Where is our equivalent to the Arab Spring? Why do we not take to the streets en masse and demand true reform? Why do we seem to care less and less each day? People have become far too complacent and comfortable with the status quo. They give us just enough crumbs and distractions to look the other way while those at the top take more and more. </p>

<p>People need to open their eyes and see no matter what side you subscribe too, we won&#39;t get ahead until we are united. Left and right may not share the exact same ideals but they do fuck us the same way. Put your fellow humans first. Start small and treat those around you with kindness, respect, and dignity, don&#39;t be afraid to think freely and discuss openly rather than fight and stick your fingers in your ears. It&#39;s not left vs right, black vs white, Christianity vs Islam; it&#39;s top vs bottom. And they need to start being held accountable. Time to break the status quo.</p>
