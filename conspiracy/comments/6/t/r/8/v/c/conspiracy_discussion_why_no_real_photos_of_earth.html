        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Honest questions.  No flat earth bs.  I believe they are hiding something big about space, this planet, something next level that tptb want to keep us away from, keeping us in the dark, dumbed, numbed to the soul.  We are the lost souls.  Why dont we have loads of pictures of earth from outer space? Entire frame full planet shots? Not the paintings or cgi enhanced composites. Why dont we have any modem day outer space views of earth? Again, the ones i can find are supposedly images placed together using various computers, etc, so TECHNICALLY they are composites and not a true image. Another question, Why cant i find any real photos of satellites in space?  Like look up and see how many satellites are supposedly in orbit, but yet we never see a view of any of them.  Photo challenge peeps.  I mean, shouldnt the folks in the international space station be able to spot space junk floating around in our atmosphere?  Small, but still viewable.  Their are tons of satellites up there.  Why not put any webcams, attached to them for space views?  Why not? Why not have drones flying around the moon by now? Why not have webcams on the moon by now?  We can send a rover to mars, but cant have like even one on our own moon, why not!? Lack of money and imagination is all i hear. Smells like bs to me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>NASA <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/from-a-million-miles-away-nasa-camera-shows-moon-crossing-face-of-earth">answered that question</a>.  It&#39;s because unlike the digital camera in your phone, which snaps the different color exposures near-instantaneously, DSCOVR takes them about 30 seconds apart.  (Yes, this is a &quot;composite,&quot; but in the same sense that basically every photo you&#39;ve ever seen in your life is a &quot;composite&quot; of masks for the three primary colors and black &amp; white.)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>EPIC’s “natural color” images of Earth are generated by combining three separate monochrome exposures taken by the camera in quick succession. EPIC takes a series of 10 images using different narrowband spectral filters -- from ultraviolet to near infrared -- to produce a variety of science products. The red, green and blue channel images are used in these color images.</p>

<p>Combining three images taken about 30 seconds apart as the moon moves produces a slight but noticeable camera artifact on the right side of the moon. Because the moon has moved in relation to the Earth between the time the first (red) and last (green) exposures were made, a thin green offset appears on the right side of the moon when the three exposures are combined. This natural lunar movement also produces a slight red and blue offset on the left side of the moon in these unaltered images.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Clouds are moving <em>extremely</em> slow from this scale. The highest wind speeds ever recorded are around a couple hundred miles an hour, and average global wind speed is around 20 mph.  The moon is moving at 2,300 mph.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>where is the refraction of sunlight around the edge</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m not sure what you expect to see.  Remember that the satellite&#39;s located at the Lagrange point directly between the sun and the earth, so it&#39;s perfectly backlit, centered on the exact middle of be planet.  You can definitely see that it&#39;s hazier and more defuse by the circumference, where the angle goes through more atmosphere.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Not sure what you mean by that </p>

<p>, what part of the planet even is that, I can&#39;t recognise any continental shapes</p>

<p>Pacific Ocean. That&#39;s Baja California going too right, Australia coming in bottom left</p>

<p>You&#39;ve seen a <a href="http://i.imgur.com/XBqQEGq.jpg">&quot;dolly zoom&quot;</a> before, where you zoom out while pulling closer to the subject.  You can see in the gif how objects in the background appear to shrink as you pull closer to the subject in the foreground. If you&#39;re orbiting the moon, the foreground object (moon) is about 10 miles away while the background object (earth) is about 250,000 miles away.  From L1, the foreground object is about 750,000 miles away and the background object is about 1,000,000 miles away.  The latter gives you a more accurate perspective -- in reality the moon is about a quarter the diameter of earth.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This just looks sloppy. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityIsUnrealistic">Reality is Unrealistic</a>.  You have no frame of reference for what things should look like from Lagrangian 1.  Relatively few spacecraft get further than a couple thousand miles from earth, only a fraction of those ever go beyond the moon&#39;s orbit, and most of those are heading out to other bodies.  Only a handful of craft have ever been parked at the Lagrangian points and none have been capable of taking true color photos like this.  It looks sloppy because it doesn&#39;t match up with what you <em>expect</em> this to look like, but none of the experiences forming that expectation were anything like sitting at Lagrangian 1 watching the moon transverse the earth.</p>

<p>It was your expectations that were wrong, not the photo </p>

<p>But why is that laughable?  What&#39;s your basis for thinking the moon <em>shouldn&#39;t</em> look like a burnt cookie from L1?  I&#39;m not being facetious here, I&#39;m trying to get you to be open minded about your preconceived notions.  </p>

<p>You&#39;ve never seen the far side of the moon, illuminated by full sunlight, from 932,000 miles away in space.  You&#39;ve only seen the near side of the moon, from the planet&#39;s surface, through an atmosphere, from 239,000 miles away.  You have no frame of reference for what this scene <em>should</em> look like, so your gut sense that it looks &quot;wrong&quot; isn&#39;t based in anything at all -- you have to question your instincts that aren&#39;t coming from anything within your personal experience. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think you get what &quot;photo&quot; means . . . . </p>

<p>Yeah, NASA didn&#39;t send up satellites with simply visible spectrum cameras like you have in your phone.  I mean, do you think NASA just straps a Nikon CoolPix onto a satellite and rockets it into space?  Wasting precious launch weight on a simple true-color camera would be ridiculously stupid.  They have more sophisticated equipment to measure a wide swath of wavelengths that are all captured and used for different purposes, including mixing into &quot;true color&quot; images for public consumption.</p>

<p>I mean, what do you think photography <em>is</em>?  A normal film camera uses film sensitive to three different primary colors -- when you make a photograph, mix four masks, one for each color and one for black &amp; white, and with the final image being a <strong>COMPOSITE</strong> of all four channels.  How do you think your eyes work?  Cones sensitive to particular colors are triggered by specific photons and then combined by your brain into a single image, alongside rods detecting light level.<br/>
(One could almost say your brain makes a composite).</p>

<p>A photo is just a photo -- photons hitting a light-sensitive receptor. It&#39;s not less of a photo because it&#39;s only capturing a particular wavelength, including those outside the visible spectrum.</p>

<p>What?  I&#39;m not sure what you&#39;re expecting to see.  It wouldn&#39;t be some bulge right at the equator. It&#39;s just that if you measure the earth&#39;s diameter across the Equatorial latitude, it&#39;s 26 miles longer than if you measure down the axis of rotation.</p>

<p>I also hadn&#39;t considered earlier that you difference in circumstance wouldn&#39;t be fully expressed from a point of view it unless you&#39;re looking at earth from a vantage point perpendicular to the axis of rotation and aligned with earth&#39;s center.  The earth&#39;s equator isn&#39;t aligned with the orbit of the moon -- there&#39;s about a 30 degree difference -- so no pictures from the Apollo missions (which would be taken from the orbital plane of the moon) would be perpendicular to the equator.</p>

<p>Also, why would NASA waste money on something like you said when they&#39;ve already measured the bulge (and the rest of the planet) far more accurately by pinging the surface with radar and measuring gravitational pull from low earth orbit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just measured the Apollo 17 picture of earth (not a composite), and this time I put guides on the left and top of the earth and starting at the intersection of guides drew a perfect circle of the earth so I could fill in the tiny sliver of terminator line/night on the right. My measurements:</p>

<p>2688 pixels wide, 2689 tall.</p>

<p>So I measured 1 pixel too tall, almost a perfect sphere. Where is this bulge of over 12 pixels? Where is it pear-shaped when the image is a perfect circle? The only image I measured to have this bulge is the 2012 VIIRS composite with a ridiculous 162 mile bulge.</p>

<p>Try the measurement in Photoshop yourself. Keep in my mind this is one of <em>very</em> few they claim are actual pictures and not made in MS Paint, or Photoshop or whatever software they use to fake the usual pictures of earth. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are no satellites that are that far away from Earth. Here&#39;s a <a href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/polopoly_fs/1.1269312.1367865691!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1020/image.jpg">photo</a> from the international space station. Nothing is far up enough to get a good photo of Earth. The farthest thing up is the GPS satellites, but they don&#39;t take photos. <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/thumbnails/image/3-as08-14-2383a.jpg">Here&#39;s a photo from the moon</a> It&#39;s a fairly famous photo. </p>

<p>The reason you don&#39;t see any photos of satellites in space is because no one thinks of taking a photo of them. Photos from the space station don&#39;t shot show them because they&#39;re insignificantly small. And it&#39;s really hard to see anything small in space unless it&#39;s being directly hit by lite. If it isn&#39;t being directly hit by light, it basically looks invisible. </p>

<p>As a comparison the STEREO satellites are not really contested in being legitimate or functional.

<p>Yet no live-feed or even a few second delay of the Earth from the same claimed orbit. The HDEV is terrible quality [1990s version of &quot;HD&quot;] and the DISCOVR image database is updated only the next day, clearly edited. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because you have to go far beyond orbit to get the whole planet in frame. We have plenty of photos of the earth from the moon missions. And I think I&#39;ve seen some from the Mars missions as well. I don&#39;t know where to go to find them but they were certainly in the news and documentaries at the time. </p>

<p>As for the satellites it&#39;s the opposite problem. They&#39;re usually about the size of a refrigerator. Maybe a semi truck. What do objects that size look like from a few miles away? A dot. Now put one in orbit. It&#39;s very tiny. Even with a telescope it&#39;s just a small blur. </p>

<p>You are right, I mixed up technical terms. Not a native speaker, sorry. </p>

<p>Can you explain why it cant extend several KM up?</p>

<p>Why would it? The boundary layer thickness is independent of the diameter of the ball: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary-layer_thickness">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary-layer_thickness</a></p>

<p>The air moves in the same direction as the planet, just <em>faster</em>. </p>

<p>TS was right when [s]he said &quot;Keep in mind there is still no real explanation for why the atmosphere supposedly rotates perfectly with the earth&quot;. There isn&#39;t. And there are even less explanations for its superrotation. </p>

You don&#39;t think its just a bit odd that not even ONE photo of satellites in our atmosphere exists?  People just saying &quot;why would we have them&quot; is an excuse. Or how no one has answers to anything else I pointed out.  </p>
