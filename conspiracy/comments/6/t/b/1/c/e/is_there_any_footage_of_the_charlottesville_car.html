<p>The key question is: did the driver panic? Was there a confrontation moments before with the driver? Was there any damage done to the vehicle before impact? </p>

<p>The only real footage of the car starts from driver side to the rear. We need anything from the front to the passenger side.</p>

We have no idea what happened before the choice was made to go ramming speed. Obviously the person recording the video was recording before the incident, so why the cut footage?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, it really doesn&#39;t.  This is the main video everyone has already seen, and doesn&#39;t begin until the suspect has accelerated. </p>

<p>We can&#39;t tell if anyone yelled out threats, or threw anything at the passenger side. The video literally starts at the moment of acceleration, which in itself is odd. Something made that person hit record at that moment (which would have happened seconds earlier), or they were already recording and that footage has been cut.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe the person started recording when a car got close to him? I mean come on, he wasn&#39;t really accelerating until just after the recording started (imo). </p>

<p>My issue is that people seems hellbent on finding an excuse when the issue is simple: the road when he started accelerating wasn&#39;t that busy, he could of reversed, he accelerated into a crowd of people. </p>

<p>If he was already surrounded by people, then I would get why extra footage is needed, but that isn&#39;t what happened.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve watched the video a few times now, and you can see people walking on either sides of the street, not banging on either of the cars that end up being rear-ended. So while I can&#39;t say with 100% certainty, it seems pretty clear people weren&#39;t fucking with the cars. Maybe this guy was different, no idea. But it seems a little far-fetched that a driver who is frightened by a group of people would choose to drive deeper into the crowd instead of reversing initially. /2¢</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Justification? You mean if perhaps this was accidental or unintentional? That would be nice, still terribly sad, but comforting in at least the tiniest of ways. However, my guess is it is simply another display of mankind&#39;s hatred and disregard for life. Seems farfetched to be an accident. Whether orchestrated by something bigger or a simpleminded fucks way of thinking he could make a difference. Another person filled with rage from a system whose function seems to breed these emotions. Do not confuse my statements as justifications or as vindicating. Free speech is allowed. That&#39;s freedom. 99.99/100 you won&#39;t change a garbage piece of Shit from thinking some outlandish bullshit their parents ingrained them with or for whatever fucking reason they came to the conclusion they did. Still, hate breeds hate. Violence brings violence. That&#39;s what happened. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The main video is likely a cut of someone already recording the protest, who then turned to the vehicle. Even if the vehicle was not in frame before the video starts, even audio from seconds beforehand can contain useful information. It is highly unlikely that the person recording just happened to hit the record button at that exact instant. There is likely footage that has been cut.</p>
