    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. We are so programmed to think we need money to get all the stuff we want. That&#39;s what we are really up against. Is our conditioned view that money is the key.</p>

<p>How would you suppose a society could function without it? Because if you think like this, then that means people with no money are dysfunctional and can&#39;t get the stuff they need. And that&#39;s a terrible part of our society when it&#39;s money that is obviously dysfunctional. And we are conditioned to accept it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a really difficult discussion IMO. Currency <em>is</em> a good alternative to a barter or a communal sharing system, because neither of those really work in a large modern society. Not to sound like a socialist, but if money was distributed in an equal and fair way that is determined by how much work you do, currency would work fine. As it is, money allows the rich to have too much power. Once you can earn profits without putting in any work (i.e owning a factory), it opens up a lot of potential for exploitation, and damages the societal value of money. I&#39;m in no way a communist, but the communist school of thought on alternatives to currency and post-currency society is really interesting. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea but I don&#39;t think we can used that system because it&#39;s stigmatized. We really need something new. Like you said the social imbalances need to be addressed to. I think that&#39;s just getting worst. Especially since we are having more people in this world, only a few having the wealth is very limiting for everyone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Stigma can be fought. Socialism is flawed, but as technology and automation progress, it will increasingly become a better system than capitalism. Socialism doesn&#39;t have a good track record, but in every failed socialist state there is one constant - a lack of resources. Whether this lack was brought on by poor authoritarian planning (Maoist china), through foreign intervention (a lot of Latin America) or just bad luck, depends on the individual socialist state. But as automation increases, no amount of poor planning can lead to a starving population because we will be able to produce much more food. I&#39;m not a socialist but it&#39;s pretty obvious: America has intervened in every socialist state and tried to bring about its downfall, because they are scared of socialism. And this fear isn&#39;t out of a love of their people, America is just scared of capitalism losing power, and they know socialism <em>can</em> work. That&#39;s why there is still so much anti-socialist propaganda today. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea, like certain words when you hear them or see them or speak them are charged. Usually they carry a charge like a positive or negative. The word Vice is up there with &quot; Sin&quot;. If you were to put Sin on a dollar then when people noticed it the relationship would be to avert it.  Like I&#39;m saying, this money has symbolism deep in our conscious that at one time held positive charge. Icons of forefathers, in God we trust, Roman society, God&#39;s , etc. All charged symbolism.</p>

<p>So yea, you would need the inscription to carry charges that are uncomfortable. See?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Then they will realize that the reality they are taught through the media is fabricated by those elitists pushing a luciferian agenda. They will also realize that Lucifer and Jesus may be real if the world is run by luciferians as he Bible warned. Most importantly they will have a heads up so they can be informed of what Christianity and luciferianism are and if the Christian God is real-which research will support-than they know that they need to avoid mortal sin to avoid hell. Their souls are the main thing to protect. They can avoid hell and accept Jesus as lord and savior and repent for sins and rebel unclean souruts( demons/devils/Lucifer.) if my research is correct, this is the most important thing they can do to protect themselves. This is a war between good and evil for their souls. Not just their money. The money is just a control and power thing that is used to force people to commit mortal sin by slowly pushing them to murder or suicide. Just legalizing abortion or forcing citizens to go to war is enough to lose your soul if you don&#39;t repent. If they realize the media is pushing people to be atheist and hate Christians then they have a chance of not blindly following that agenda. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you want a massive force multiplier on your effort:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Get a bunch of 5s, 10s, 20s, write them up, put them into a slot machine at a casino. Most won&#39;t take 1s, but if they do, that makes your job that much easier.</p></li>
<li><p>Cash out, get a ticket, take it to the change machine, which will give you &quot;clean&quot; money</p></li>
<li><p>This will probably be in hundreds, so see if you can break it down to smaller denominations (most casino ticket machines will do &quot;bill breaking&quot; for free)</p></li>
<li><p>Go to the bathroom (away from cameras), write up the new money.</p></li>
<li><p>Put the new money into the machine</p></li>
<li><p>Repeat steps 2-5 as desired</p></li>
<li><p>When you&#39;re done for the day, cash back out, and take home all the money you brought (and promptly write your messages all over it).</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Now, instead of putting a few bills into circulation each day (you should only mix one into each transaction, or it&#39;ll be obvious you wrote on the money), you can put hundreds of them into circulation for just an hour&#39;s work.</p>

<p>That would be a good thing to test out.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Even if only 1/3 of it goes back into circulation, you can basically create it as fast as you can feed it into a machine, withdraw it, and write on it. </p>

<p>If you get a stamp made up, it would be even faster. I imagine you could get over a thousand an hour done. Honestly, your views/hour of time investment would be absolutely insane with something like this.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s say you get 300 to stay in circulation. Average bill is going to change hands maybe 500 times before it is pulled from circulation (faster for 1s, slower for 100s, but number of transactions will be similar).  You&#39;re looking at the potential for ~150,000 views for an hour of work. </p>

<p>A stamp would be a great investment for the cause though and I guess if they operate dining/drinks at the venue they would need to use some of it for change</p>

<p>You don&#39;t have to play a single hand. Just put the money into the machine and instantly cash out. You can do this whole thing without losing a cent, minus any gratuities I suppose. </p>
