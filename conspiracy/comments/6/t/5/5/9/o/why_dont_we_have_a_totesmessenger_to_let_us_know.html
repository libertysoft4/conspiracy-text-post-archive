And it&#39;s so obvious that it kind of works, because all the shells freak out and start posting tons of comments about how a trump post is put into contest mode, like it has ANYTHING to do with the mod supporting Trump or not, it has to do with the fact that those are obviously targeted post to be manipulated and used against this sub.

    <div class="md"><p>Me neither. The idea itself isn&#39;t bad but the Troll Army uses that against them and just buries every post and all of the comments talking about how unfair the situation is.

<p>The fact of the matter is though, especially in the last couple months, a lot of what we are talking about here is seriously artificial intelligence and not just scripted Bots. We&#39;ve already read articles about how they&#39;re making their own languages that humans can&#39;t read and it&#39;s only going to get crazier so I&#39;m not really sure what the endgame is here ...</p>

<p>The topics that have been put into contest mode recently are my favorite ones to read if you want some truth about the situation. The actual real users of this sub which is always to be concerned with, benefit and thoroughly enjoy contest mode. If the cock suckers who are here for no other reason than to bitch and participate in topics that they don&#39;t like and make themselves look like fucking morons, who really cares this isn&#39;t their fucking sub!! </p>

<p>I object because the reality is that it kills participation.</p>

<p>I object because the above can mean it&#39;s used to kill certain posts as appears to have been the practice to date.</p>

<p>I object because of the potential for censorship (removing comments until only ones you like are immediately visible).</p>

<p>I object because of the potential for abuse by spamming top level comments for one POV to increase the chance of their visibility.</p>

<p>I&#39;d rather have comments sorted by &quot;New&quot; than contest mode and that&#39;s bad enough.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. </p>

<p>If I&#39;m being completely honest this sub may already be beyond any help but that would be a nice last ditch effort. Even then, it&#39;s just delaying the sinking of the Titanic here. </p>

<p>I hope all of the paid and non-paid she&#39;ll cocksuckers understand that while they have destroyed this sub, they did not change even one single fucking mind of someone who was awake. They&#39;re stupid, trivial, Elementary, uneducated, out-of-touch, comments do not affect those who are already awake. </p>

<p>The only success I will give to them is that they have destroyed any hope of people who are still in a deep Slumber coming to the sub and helping themselves to awake. It&#39;s a wrap on that lol they definitely did destroy the sub itself. But as we all know, we will all crop up somewhere else on the internet that will have free speech and access for a while before it to becomes invaded. All of the propaganda that is done across the entire media in all comment sections on all websites is literally a whole separate thing from trying to take down this sub. The tactics that are needed for those of us who are already awake are not even in their Arsenal or on their radar. Once you are awake, you can&#39;t be put back to sleep so I&#39;m not really sure what their game plan is but I doubt they have one for that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>u/TotesMessenger isn&#39;t banned just shadowbanned so only mods can see the comments. I dunno if there&#39;s an easy way for you to find the comments yourself without scrolling through page after page of that account&#39;s comments. They won&#39;t be on ceddit because they&#39;re removed too quick.</p>

<p>I have seen the mods give various reasons including preventing brigading from here.</p>

<p>But from my observations I believe it&#39;s so that they can overstate the extent of any brigading and use that as an excuse to remove a post or use contest mode. Maybe u/Sarah_Connor had words about this during the &quot;recess,&quot; I hope so. If the mods could update us on the admin response to their reports of brigading that would be good too, we are told it will be &quot;cleaned up in a few days&quot; each time. Are they even contacted? Because I am not seeing anything about their response.</p>

<p>These aren&#39;t coincidences or chance. There&#39;s a reason mods don&#39;t release the &quot;proof&quot; of brigading they have or enact any measures for reporting who is linking to here. </p>

<p>Ive been around for years and I remember when Totes was allowed on this sub. Back then it was always r/conspiratard. </p>

<p>Easier times for sure haha</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually it&#39;s more like the Troll Army is trying to turn our sub against the Donald sub and the only people coming here and causing a problem is the Troll Army. They are trying to make an enemy of the Donald with us because if we actually work together the power of that collaboration would make actual waves in the world. So how about we tell the truth instead of babbling on about a bunch of garbage. </p>

<p>When flytape invited TD here when they went private </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t recall u/flytape or any of the mods <em>inviting</em> them here specifically when they went private - unless I missed something, like him posting in t_d and telling them to come here or something.</p>

<p>I do remember the post that was made reminding any t_d people who would be spending more time in this sub than usual of <em>our</em> rules. </p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t consider that &quot;inviting&quot; anyone - considering they would&#39;ve spent more time here when their sub went private regardless of anyone making that post. There were obviously going to be discussions here about what was going on with their sub and any possible conspiracies involved.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Conspiracy is no place for the blind loyalty and subservience to the top seat of the us govt. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>r/conspiracy is a place to discuss <em>conspiracies</em>.</p>

<p>There is nothing in the rules stating you <em>have</em> to feel any sort of way about the US or any other country&#39;s leadership or government.</p>

<p>We&#39;ve had people here who would (and still do) defend <em>everything</em> Obama said and did, but if they wanna come here to talk about JFK, Aliens, UFOs, alternative history, whatever.. they&#39;re allowed to. So are Trump supporters.</p>

<p>I even see people getting tons of upvotes for saying bullshit like &quot;this sub and it&#39;s community are &#39;anti-government&#39;&quot;, which I never saw until Trump won and all of a sudden everyone&#39;s a damn anarchist pretending it has <em>anything</em> to do with the actual concept of government. Especially when less than a year ago they were riding Hillary or Bernie trains.</p>

<p>This sub is for conspiracies. Not just some conspiracies. Not just &quot;only if you don&#39;t support this person&quot; conspiracies. </p>

<p>And it&#39;s definitely not &quot;You&#39;re only allowed here if you actively question the sitting US President, only the sitting President, not past ones except maybe the Bush&#39;s and definitely not politicians who recently lost an election&quot; conspiracies.</p>
