        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This all started when I was listening to the rock band Tool, oddly enough. I started researching their music and found out that they hint quite often at the idea that hallucinogens allow you to other realms of reality and alien entities.</p>

<p>I started looking at their suggested readings, and found an author named Terence McKenna that claims to have made contact with an extra terrestrial mushroom that has found its way to earth. If this sounds crazy, you can read more about it here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MG5gFtZ3U8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MG5gFtZ3U8</a></p>

<p>After researching his theories, I found that it fits perfectly with the emerging science of quantum biology that suggests that consciousness is a property of the universe itself and creates solid matter, and not the other way around. You can learn more about this here: <a href="https://youtu.be/Mm6Mt9BoZ_M">https://youtu.be/Mm6Mt9BoZ_M</a></p>

<p>Interestingly enough, this led me to the study of sacred geometry, another type of suggested reading on Tools list, and found amazing theories that show that Sacred Geometry can describe advanced mathematics, and even mimic the creation story of the universe for all mainstream religions. I don&#39;t know much about this subject, but you can learn how this mimics the creation story here: <a href="https://youtu.be/FSmdSw9eEIA">https://youtu.be/FSmdSw9eEIA</a></p>

<p>After learning about this, I started to research out of body experiences from a couple books by Bob Frizzle, whom claims that there&#39;s an alien cover-up by the world governments, and that aliens are extra dimensional beings, just like everything else I&#39;ve learned. You can look up his books or hear an interview with him here: <a href="https://youtu.be/FmGuaVRi7-s">https://youtu.be/FmGuaVRi7-s</a>
At this point, I started doing some genuine UFO research, and found a common theme among abductee claims and military personnel that say that the grey alien&#39;s eyes are large night vision lenses, and underneath are very small human like eyes. I shrugged this off as unimportant.
Continuing down the list, I looked into Alistair Crowley, whom claims to have made contact with with a demon named &quot;Lam&quot;. This is where things become interesting....Alistair Crowley summoned Lam in a demonic ritual in the great pyramid of Giza, and here is a link to the story which shows a picture of the demon: 
<a href="https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/cienciareal/cienciareal07.htm">https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/cienciareal/cienciareal07.htm</a></p>

<p>Creepy as f*ck. In 1918, this man describes and draws a grey alien without the black lenses on his eyes. At this point, I turned my attention to crop circles, as I had no idea if they were all hoaxes or if some were genuine.
Here&#39;s a scientific lecture explaining how many crop circles are not man made, and have no logical explanation for their formation: <a href="https://youtu.be/8Rnb70rdjGQ">https://youtu.be/8Rnb70rdjGQ</a></p>

<p>After refuting my bias that crop circles were all man made, I started looking to see if any circles had any real messages. I found a video of a scientist that claims to have decrypted crop circle messages: <a href="https://youtu.be/gA1gF8FtyoI">https://youtu.be/gA1gF8FtyoI</a></p>

<p>While not all of his interpretations are credible, there are a couple messages in binary that are very clear: <a href="http://www.cropcircleconnector.com/articles/09052016/cj-binary16.jpg">http://www.cropcircleconnector.com/articles/09052016/cj-binary16.jpg</a></p>

<p>The curious thing about these specific crop circles is that they indicate that there are multiple extra terrestrials sending us messages, warning us of each other. Only one crop circle has had a signature on it, and that&#39;s the one that says Ea Enki. I decided to do some research on this ancient god.</p>

<p>After a lot of research, there&#39;s a common consensus that this entity is both the ancient god that created man from the Sumerian religion, and the god that Moses met on Mt Cyanide. Here&#39;s the proof of this: <a href="https://youtu.be/gLY-kREGwno">https://youtu.be/gLY-kREGwno</a></p>

<p>Very interesting! But since religion is not my thing, I cannot accept that this is a god, but rather a vengeful, jealous entity as the old testimate states.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the Revelation 12 prediction is apparently in progress, as it refers to an alignment of the stars, planets, and sun. You can read how this prophecy is being fulfilled here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSqPiR2EK2s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSqPiR2EK2s</a></p>

<p>What does this lead me to? The conclusion that we are going to be visited by multiple extra terrestrials trying to take control of us, very soon. Some will claim to be gods, and others will claim to be our friends. We probably cannot trust any of them if this comes to pass.</p>

<p>There are many theories online that suggest that either Christianity is correct and Jesus is returning after the Anti-Christ with the mark of the beast. I heard some clever ideas that the mark of the beast is the third eye, and that you make a triple 6 with your fingers when meditating by forming the &quot;A-OK&quot; hand gesture, and there was a lot of evidence that NASA uses this gesture constantly and that there is a large satanic conspiracy. </p>

<p>There are other beliefs like Scientology and Buddhism that state that we are trapped in a cycle on this plane and it&#39;s a trap, and only when we reach enlightenment will we be able to escape our physical bonds for eternity.</p>

<p>My bet, is that there are no Gods, the mushroom Terence McKenna talked to is correct, and we need to start funding DMT alien contact research. Comments?

    <div class="md"><p>Look up Lilith :). Also. YouTube the cern ritual ceremony that was he formal opening of the Large H Collider. Also look up the video symmetry by Cern. Then see where they built cern. It&#39;s Apollyon. Then realize that this space bending machine that can possibly open worm holes was built specifically over the city where the Greeks believe this evil dark thing is buried. The same city where in revelations the portal to a dark guy is opened. And this was the first year Cern attended the Bilderberg meetings. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. Yes I do. Because why not? Science / alchemy / witchcraft.. sorta all the same thing in a way. In fact, I find it MORE believable they would do a ceremony there BECAUSE they do science there. I bet you have no reasonable answer to explain what can be explained through particle physics. However, this is conspiracy so I do have to commend you on taking that ceremony a step further than I did in my rationality. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a giant campus with miles of tunnels, so the potential for some crazy shit is definitely there, but I never once saw anything that couldn&#39;t have also been in a Big Bang Theory episode (as painful as that is to admit). Coworkers were either an absolute delight, or kept entirely to themselves. It was a really nice place to work. It was similar to a college campus; they have a club for everything. I know I make it sound harmless, but if anything sinister going on, 99.99% of the employees were entirely unaware. Learned a lot. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t really know, we&#39;re going back almost 10 years now and I was entirely unaware or all the surrounding theories. My life was on an entirely different course back then.</p>

<p>Personally, I think that when you spend billions of dollars attempting to discover the end of the fiber that ties our reality together, one might carelessly pull the thread and begin the unraveling. The entire field is based on discovering the unknown unknowns, or the thought to be unknowns, so really, who knows? I&#39;m by no means an expert though, so I don&#39;t mean to support a potential confirmation bias. </p>

<p>If you&#39;re interested in the subject, check out Hyperspace by Michio Kaku. He does a great job of discussing a relatable subject and using it as an analogy to discuss some of the more complex facets of quantum mechanics. The best way to confirm or deny a theory is to build up that background knowledge! </p>

Man, you might want to be careful, the praying mantis-like arms make me think of posturing or indication of some kind of cerebral malfunction/seizure. Idk though, just me guessing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well you brought forth a lot of interesting information and intriguing ideas about it all. You summed it up rather abruptly which took away the credibility for some reason for me.</p>

<p>But I am familiar with Terrance McKenna and do believe we are all one and the same. You can literally get electrons that interact with your eye from stars billions of of trillions of light years away, as far as I&#39;m concerned those electrons or photons or whatever the hell it is that we see from stars is interactive with our bodies, we are connected even if just by a string . </p>

<p>More so I think we are here for a reason. Maybe it&#39;s to govern this domain and hopefully we were the best choice to hold this dimension for positive reasons . Sometimes I&#39;m scared we are just a methane and carbon monoxide and whatever other by products we create in bulk for the next inhabitants of earth. Hope not tho. What if the story of Jesus is trying to teach us that we, humans are the physical form of god, as Jesus was a human and died, and we too are humans and will die, and he died for our sins of which we did not know or see, perhaps the story is to fight against the old god or gods that will return and realize we are the god of this dimension and need to fight or protect ourselves with unity .</p>

<p>Honestly mostly high ramblings but, like literally any fucking thing is possible, humans coming about and doing all the things we do, all the chance happenings , meteor strikes , oxygen levels, water , gravity, distance from the sun, consciousness, thumbs , language, countries, planes, trains and spaceships, I mean the likelihood of these things going on in a completely random and chaotic universe is literally impossible, the chances are like less than I could even give a good metaphor for , its like .0000000000000000000xinfinite to <sup>-infinite</sup> , this shouldn&#39;t be going on, all are the most unlikely things to have happened in the universe . So I always keep in mind we are in a place where the most unlikely things are somehow likely to happen.</p>

<p>There is only so much you can glean from reading about psychedelics, at some point you just have to jump in and experience it. </p>

<p>You could spend your whole life reading about it and not even get the slightest understanding of it compared to experiencing it. The closest analogy I can think of is to study sex your whole life and never experience it.</p>
