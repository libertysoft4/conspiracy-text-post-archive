        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I am not an engineer or an architect, and neither are you. Neither are the zombies who continue to parrot the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuC_4mGTs98">U.S. Government&#39;s Officially Sponsored Conspiracy Theory</a>™. So, it makes a lot of sense for subversive forces to focus on the engineering aspect of their Official Conspiracy Theory™, since adding more lies to the shit swirl will only serve to further confuse and frustrate those who are still <em>on the fence.</em></p>

<p>So let&#39;s take a moment to remind each other about some of the much more obvious red flags that laymen can understand.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>&quot;To date, the U.S. government has not been able to determine the origin of the money used for the 9/11 attacks. Ultimately the question is of little practical significance.&quot; - <a href="https://www.9-11commission.gov/report/911Report_Ch5.htm">9/11 Commission</a></p></li>
<li><p>Out of 185,000 tons of evidence, all excluding 150 pieces were recycled and sold to China on discount. Additionally, those 150 pieces of evidence were chosen <em>after</em> they had already been picked through at Ground Zero and moved.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.corbettreport.com/911-suspects-dancing-israelis/">The Dancing Israeli&#39;s were released</a>, to later go on Israeli television to say: “And at that point we were taken for another round of questioning. This time related to us allegedly being members of Mossad. The fact of the matter is, we are coming from a country that experiences terror daily. <em>Our purpose was to document the event</em>.”</p></li>
<li><p>The presence of nano-thermite in dust samples taken from Ground Zero.</p></li>
<li><p>Why is there no mention of the <a href="https://youtu.be/D290n9pvUsE">car bomb that went off outside the State Department</a> or the <a href="http://historycommons.org/searchResults.jsp?articles=on&amp;amp;descriptions=on&amp;amp;dosearch=on&amp;amp;entities=on&amp;amp;events=on&amp;amp;projects=on&amp;amp;search=Go&amp;amp;searchtext=longboat+&amp;amp;timelines=on&amp;amp;titles=on&amp;amp;topics=on">assassination attempt on President Bush that morning</a>? There is a collective amnesia about these <strong>relatively</strong> minor events, and they&#39;re not going to be written into the history books.</p></li>
<li><p>Why was Cheney immediately ushered to an underground bunker while President Bush was left out in the open at a public school, during a public event? This is the creepiest question of them all.</p></li>
<li><p>Why were Cheney and Bush allowed to testify in secret, off the record, not under oath, behind closed doors, <em>and together?</em></p></li>
<li><p>Why did no one lose their job?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>What else have we got? There&#39;s too much for one man to recall all of it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve never heard about the car bomb, that&#39;s really interesting. I was doing some digging and I found a person on prison planet who says it was a hoax.</p>

<p><a href="http://forum.prisonplanet.com/index.php?topic=66908.0">http://forum.prisonplanet.com/index.php?topic=66908.0</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>This ‘car bomb’ hoax came from the original reports of the 9:31:39 AM missile strike (my thread) that created only ‘inside-the-building fires’ (Barbara Honegger’s famous paper). This ‘car bomb’ story was floating around in the news media, because other reports like this one (CNN Chief Correspondent Jamie McIntyre’s News Report) saying, according to his close-up inspection that, “there is no evidence of a plane having crashed anywhere near the Pentagon.” Donald Rumsfeld told Parade Magazine the next day (9/12) that the Pentagon was struck by a ‘missile’ (story from my Pentagon Thread here), which made more sense at the time over the complete lack of physical evidence for any crashed 100-Ton Jetliner (this is what really happened).   The Official DoD/Bush Administration Cover Story that AA77 crashed into the Pentagon is a complete fabrication based upon nothing but Loyal Bushie LIES. The car bomb story is just one of many fabrications to circulate through the Disinformation Media Machine during the 9/11 attacks.</p>

<p>TLDR: Bush was not involved until after the fact. The assassination attempt and the act of leaving him open and vulnerable in that school was a threat from the coup faction that took hold officially on 9/11. He was given the option to go along with the scheme or be murdered. He chose to go along.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It does not at all. I work in the industry. </p>

<p>I hope you aren&#39;t shorting shit or running straddles because this is common Series 7 shit.</p>

<p>Shorting is when you sell a position at X price on margin(current market) and then you need to pay it back later by replacing the shares. The goal is for it to drop in price and that&#39;s when you buy the shares to replace it.</p>

<p>If you own, let&#39;s say, AMD, that you bought at $10 and it&#39;s currently at $14 you can short it at $14 and you have to pay it back whenever. Now, you can use those shares you bought at $10 of course. OR you can wait for it to drop to $5 and buy it then to replace your borrowed shares. The $10 shares you own are just there as a stop loss. You&#39;re already guranteed to make $4 per share and buy having them bought at $10 you&#39;re protecting yourself if prices end up rising. You limit your downside.</p>

<p>So yeah, I understand how shorting works. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because you have the ability to make more money but with some risk.</p>

<p>If you short at $14 and it ranks to $4 per share you just made $10 per share.</p>

<p>If you bought the stock at $10 and sell at $14 you just made $4 per share. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know about you but I&#39;d prefer to make $10 per share vs $4 per share.</p>

<p>Owning the stock just protects you from having to buy it at a higher price in case your short is shit and the price actually goes up. If you short at $14 but own the stock since $10 and the price per share goes to $24 you don&#39;t take a $10 per share loss, you just take a $4 per share loss. It&#39;s a loss provention tactic if you short shares you own.</p>

<p>You very hardly ever want naked short. You&#39;re setting yourself up for unlimited loss potential.</p>

<p>If you short at $14 per share the MOST you can make is $14 per share (since the lowest it&#39;ll go is $0 (it&#39;ll probably be unlisted prior to this)) but your loss potential is UNLIMITED because it could theoretically rise to, well, any price. So by shorting with an owned position you cover yourself by limiting any loss potential.</p>

<p>These are just theoretical numbers of course and ignore annoying things like margin calls, collateral needed to actually get margin, etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s definitely not small account friendly and probably is not even worth the risk on small accounts. Indexs, positions paying dividends or providing growth are more fitting at that size. We work with $250k+ accts only and even then, 250k is too small to really put that work in consistently to provide growth. Finding income producing positions and making a smart retirement plan is by far the better route.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s known as Shorting Against the Box.</p>

<p>You do this when you believe that the shares will rebound and you want to continue holding the position long term.</p>

<p>In this case you wouldn&#39;t replace the borrow shares with your owned positions, you would buy them on the market at the lower price, your position isnjust protection and for long term holding still.</p>

<p>You would do this if you believe that the price is temporarily and will rebound.</p>

<p>So you buy at $10, short at $14, it drop to $4 and you replace those shares at a profit off the market you still own the shares and are betting the price will rebound in which case you still have your long term position.</p>

<p>Yes and it is you. Shorting a stock is borrowing it on margin and replacing it at a later date, which didn&#39;t happen to any signficant extent prior to 9/11. The suspicious trading involved derivative trades, specifically the unusually large option of purchases of put options on airline stocks. </p>

<p>However, I do admire your perseverance. Despite the fact that you have no idea what the youre talking about, you don&#39;t let it stop you from talking. </p>

<p>I doubt that is possible since you are obviously too fucktarded to understand derivatives. As I said before:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The risk in buying put options is limited to the price paid for the options.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is basic option theory and is not debatable. If you buy a put option, the only loss that you can incur is the cost of the contract. Options 101. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>What happens if that stock goes to zero genius? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Holy shit, you are braindead. If you hold a put option and the stock goes to 0, that is the best possible outcome and you realize your maximum profit. This is also the case if you shorted the stock, by borrowing it and then selling it. </p>

<p>That is correct, which is one reason why those who frontran 9/11 used options. The unusually put/call ratios on airline stocks were the red flags that indicated that fuckery was afoot. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the airline sector 8 out of 15 of the selected transactions can be traced back to the terrorist
attacks of 9/11. Companies like American Airlines, United Airlines, Boeing and to a lesser extent
Delta Air Lines and KLM seem to have been targets for informed trading activities in the period
leading up to the attacks. The number of new put options issued during that period is statistically
high and the total gains Gt realized by exercising these options amount to more than $16 million.
These findings support the evidence in Poteshman (2006) who also documents unusual activities in
the option market before the terrorist attacks. Appendix B discusses in details our detected option
informed trades before 9/11.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you suppose the fact that they&#39;re the only Muslim nation with nuclear weapons might possibly have something to do with keeping any US displeasure with them strictly low key and under wraps or with the CIA snuggling up with Pak Intelligence to run rogue mercenary fundies like ISIL for fun and profit at the same time, because that&#39;s the most obvious thing that I see about that unusual little love/hate affair.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I actually graduated with a civil engineering degree last year and work at a general contractor.</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/vMV8E_83NiI">The University of Alaska Fairbanks just finished their study on WTC 7 earlier this week.</a> They found that NIST left out key structural components (shear stud stiffeners, lateral support beams on the perimeter, and side plates on column 79). UAF came to the conclusion that fire did not cause the collapse of WTC 7 which is entirely contradicting the original NIST study. </p>

<p>There&#39;s some technical terminology in this presentation, but it&#39;s laid out in a way that is easily understood by the general public. UAF is currently modeling circumstances, including removing the central core, to figure out what caused the collapse.</p>

<li>Why had the US military defenses, particularly NORAD, failed to stop any of the four hijacked planes, particularly when the plane crashes were separated by nearly two hours?</li>
<li>What about the lack of response, both by the President, who sat in a public school in Florida after the second plane had struck, and his Secret Service detail, whose standard procedure is to grab the President and move him to safety, the morning of 9-11?</li>
<li>Why have the 9-11 emergency recordings and tapes, plus 500 interviews done of the Fire Department, right after 9-11, been withheld from the public?</li>
<li>How is that steroids in baseball is worthy of Congressional hearings, but when we have the largest structural collapse in US history and the largest loss of life since the Civil War, not one Congressional official wants to know how this happened?</li>
<li>Why was a potential suicide-pilot/conspirator who turned himself in nearly a year before 9-11, plus intelligence about hijacking American planes from fourteen nations, plus the Bush-requested Presidential Daily Briefing of August 6, ignored?</li>
<li>Why did the Justice Department, based on a FBI threat assessment, begin flying the Attorney General and other department officials by private charter jets, as reported by Dan Rather, CBS News, on July 26, 2001?</li>
<li>(As detailed by the London Times, Knight-Ridder newspapers, Newsweek, the New Yorker, and other mainstream media sources) Why was Osama bin Laden, Al Quaeda, and their Taliban supporters, allowed to escape first to Jalalabad, then to Tora Bora, and ultimately into Pakistan?</li>
<li>Why did the administration first block, then stall, then hamstring, and only then, stubbornly cooperate (if you can call it that) with an investigation?</li>
<li>Why did only about 30% of the questions provided by the Family Steering Committee get asked and answered by the 9-11 Commission? <em><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070705004203/http://action.downsizedc.org/background.php?cid=74">:: The Jersey Girls Deserve Answers</a></em></li>
