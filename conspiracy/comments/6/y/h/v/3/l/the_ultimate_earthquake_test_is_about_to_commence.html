<strong>September 6, 2017 @ 14:00 UTC
Major Spaceweather Event (X9.3 Flare) / CME</strong><em>(Updated)</em></p>

<p><strong>The largest solar flare of the current solar cycle 24 was just observed around region 2673. The massive event measuring X9.3 peaked at 12:02 UTC Wednesday. A Type II radio emission with an estimated velocity of 1969 km/s was recorded</strong>. A bright coronal mass ejection (CME) is visible in the latest STEREO Ahead imagery and will likely be directed our way. More to follow once Earth facing LASCO coronagraph imagery becomes available. Aurora sky watchers may be in for a treat later this week.</p>

<p><em>ALERT: Type II Radio Emission
Begin Time: 2017 Sep 06 1202 UTC
Estimated Velocity: 1969 km/s</em></p>

<p>Description: Type II emissions occur in association with eruptions on the sun and typically indicate a coronal mass ejection is associated with a flare event.</p>

<p>SUMMARY: 10cm Radio Burst
Begin Time: 2017 Sep 06 1154 UTC
Maximum Time: 2017 Sep 06 1156 UTC
End Time: 2017 Sep 06 1157 UTC
Duration: 3 minutes
Peak Flux: 12000 sfu</p>

<p>September 6, 2017 @ 09:25 UTC
X2.2 Flare! (Updated)
Region 2673 just produced a nice X2.2 solar flare at approximately 09:10 UTC (Sept 6). This is the first X-Class event to be detected since May 2015. The active region is still in a decent position for Earth directed eruptions. More updates will be provided should a coronal mass ejection (CME) be associated. More to follow.

<p><em>the X2 solar flare did not appear to generate a noteworthy solar flare.</em></p>

<p>I have taken the 1 min mean Bz Data from NASAs ACE (the DSCOVR data portal is relay cancer) and compared them to earthquakes. <a href="http://imgur.com/HP3ArCn">http://imgur.com/HP3ArCn</a>
Black points are earthquakes - Higher y-value -&gt; greater magnitude
The y-Value for Bz data-points is the intensity of your so called &quot;breach&quot;. I assume the intensity of a &quot;breach&quot; is |Bt - Bz|
The color shows the Bz value itself.
The values have some shitty scale for comparison.
The time frame is 01-01-17 to 08-28-17
There are really some intense earthquakes only days after a big &quot;breeches&quot; and high |Bz| values. Maybe there is a correlation. I didn&#39;t run any statistic tests, so my guess is so good as yours. And of course don&#39;t forget: &quot;Correlation does not imply causation.&quot;
At least this does not obviously contradict your theory.

<p>I had 2011 processed early. I am not giving a projected location this year. </p>

<p><strong>The projection is for a 8.0-9.5 magnitude quake.</strong></p>

<p>I&#39;ve  included all processed data showing the correlation between b&#39;s breaches and seismic events known to date. Most years showing a consistent relationship.</p>

<p>If you are good at statistical analysis  we could use your help. Please pm me. </p>

<p>So ya. </p>

<p><strong>I literally think 8.0 is easy this time around kids...</strong></p>

<p>It&#39;s coming. A week tops-

    <div class="md"><p>Does the sun facing impact area affect location? On a similiar note geomagnetic effects from flares/cmes have greater effect based on distance from equator. For instance the geomagnetic storms have alerts specifying 50 degrees off equator. Is there a correlation also attributed to Earthquakes?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have no idea if there&#39;s anything to your space weather hypothesis, although I&#39;ll be interested in seeing how successful your predictions are. But you might want to incorporate more geology into your analysis. Convergent plate boundaries, the only areas likely to experience M = 8.0-9.5 quakes, are a pressure release mechanism for plate subduction, with roughly periodic occurrence at the century scale. Really big quakes are therefore more likely to occur along convergent boundaries that have been building up pressure <em>without</em> release in the recent past at the century scale. </p>

<p>Induction isn&#39;t so effective when the geological mechanism itself requires delay longer than a human lifetime between events. Even seismologists have been running into this problem, basing predictions on historical data when in many cases, the period of the disaster far exceeds the time of observation. There are no guarantees, but I&#39;d be pretty surprised if the Japan Trench were to rupture again so soon after a 9.1 megathrust. That&#39;s a lot of pressure release. Other convergent boundaries in the area might be more vulnerable, though, like the Ryukyu trench to the south, which likewise hasn&#39;t produced a major megathrust quake in recent history, but geologically probably should at some point.</p>

<p>IF space weather is having some unrecognized effect on the timing of tectonic pressure release, certainly it must still be governed by whether there&#39;s significant pressure to release or not, right? Maybe if you can identify more vulnerable areas based on LACK of recent earthquakes despite favorable geological conditions, you can better predict when the solar flares are more dangerous, assuming you&#39;re on to something legit. Just a thought! (If there&#39;s any chance at all you could predict the timing of the Cascadia subduction zone megathrust that will sooner or later devastate the Pacific Northwest, that would be pretty amazing, because it&#39;s going to be rough whenever it happens...)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thats my initial thoughts. Devise probability algorithm of known seismology. Then use space weatgwr as a putch regulator. Which sets the pace of the assessment. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, you&#39;ve definitely got my attention. First 8+ of 2017 under 36 hours after your post. Ridiculous luck, or scientific breakthrough?</p>

<p>I&#39;d argue it demonstrates my point to an extent, too (even though that&#39;s less exciting! just wanted to point it out.) Check out the location of this earthquake <a href="https://earthquaketrack.com/p/mexico/biggest">compared to previously recorded earthquakes near Mexico</a>. This is a spot that hasn&#39;t released stress in awhile. Smaller scale than the Japan Trench example from last night -- smaller quake with necessarily more limited geographic extent of the thrust, vs. the massive rupture of the 2011 Tohoku quake. But the same principle applies. Places that are likely to experience megathrusts but haven&#39;t in awhile are ticking timebombs. Sumatra and the eastern coast of Japan along the Japan Trench are two of the safest earthquake zones in the Pacific Ring of Fire right now. Just thought that would be useful to work into your model. </p>

<p>(Incidentally, Cascadia scares the crap out of me because of the relative rarity of 6.0+-ish quakes since the ~9 in 1700. Those plates are LOCKED. I&#39;m pretty worried that with that amount of stress, it could be a pretty precarious situation down -- any disturbance might blow the whole thing without warning, I figure...)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi u/ParsingSol you made a prediction in your last one or two, poss. three posts here specifically regarding New Zealand.</p>

<p>What came of that prediction? Did it occur off the coast, deeper down or to a lesser degree than predicted or not at all?</p>

<p>Just asking as I live there/here/in NZ and didn&#39;t discern or recall anything from around the time you indicated and had been meaning to ask you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From <strong>Aug 21</strong>, the day of the Eclipse:</p>

<ul>
<li>it was <strong>30</strong> days until the Feast of Trumpets</li>
<li>it was <strong>33</strong> days until <strong>Revelation 12</strong> sign fulfilled on <strong>Sept. 23</strong> exactly</li>
<li>it was <strong>40</strong> days until the Day of Atonement</li>
</ul>

<p>The eclipse ended in the Atlantic where Harvey began</p>

<p>The massive solar flare/CME the other day that caused this 8.0 subduction zone quake is probably just the beginning of more to come since it&#39;s still so early</p>

<p>Yellowstone trembling&#39;s</p>

<p>Multiple hurricanes including one massive super one within one week</p>

<p>7 years from now another Solar eclipse goes across America forming an &quot;<strong>X</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>What is next I wonder ???</p>

<hr/>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>(Luke 21:25)</strong> - &quot;And there will be <strong>signs in sun and moon and stars</strong>, and on the earth distress of nations in perplexity because of the <strong>roaring of the sea and the waves</strong>&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>All just the beginning of birth pains. The end times show hasn&#39;t even begun to start yet. Biblical prophecy fulfillment is about to be continued to be fulfilled to it&#39;s finale, probably in less than 2 weeks =O)</p>

<p>Crazy times we live in. Truth is indeed stranger than fiction.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep. 
Sometimes I fail. Miserably. This is a good test to see full validity in a poc. All I can say is we dont have x9.3 flares with partially earth directed cme&#39;s everyday. So its cool to at least mention the idea they may affect our planets constant order of operations?</p>

<p>Honestly been hitting rough patches in and out for a bit there. Technically I am having a relatively good day yoday though. So hope it improves my accuracy. 
Jokes aside. This is an amazing event. Hopefuly we see a correlating quake. While its not conclusive proof. Its a hell of a way to prove im on to something. 
1 week. Probably gonna stop responding to comments soon. Really said all that I think I can until more updates take place. </p>

<p>How are you predicting location? Those places are known to get larger sized earthquakes. If we know there is a correlation between these solar flare events, couldn&#39;t anyone just watch for a large flare and predict an earthquake in these prone regions? It&#39;s a pretty big spread location wise.</p>

<p>They&#39;re looking at cold fronts compared to warm fronts, looking at where the fronts originated, looking at what historically weather patterns have done, they&#39;re looking at weather we&#39;re currently having and making predictions based on all of that. Modern meteorologists also use tons of computer driven models to predict the weather and more often than not, they&#39;re right. </p>

<p>Sometimes they&#39;re wrong and we get less rain than predicted, or it rains instead of snows, temperature can fluctuate within the range they give and change the weather slightly, storms can move a bit and take you out of their range. </p>

<p>But more often than not, they&#39;re correct. </p>

<p>What we&#39;re dealing with here, is someone who&#39;s constantly predicting things that don&#39;t happen most of the time, and even the times he&#39;s been &quot;right&quot;, he&#39;s still been off by a bunch. </p>

<p>His predictions aren&#39;t good or working, he&#39;s guessing based on a model that clearly isn&#39;t as accurate as he claims. </p>

<p>His only  real successes are earthquakes bellow 5.0 on highly energetic region. A user replied to one of his posts with random predictions and got an equivalent ratio of correct outcomes.</p>

<p>This is an xclass event. A 9.3 with an associated cme and earth bound componet. </p>

<p>Two entirely different things. This event dorectly following my initial theory. Which has fairly little to do woth themose posts and their direction. Time will tell in the end. 
All im asking is for a week. You have to live it anyways. So maybe consider that if a quake occurs it may not be as coincidental as seismologists want you to bekieve. Which opens the door to a new advanced earthquake &#39;prediction&#39; platform. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is not my words so I cant address your question. 
Please dont play word games and have a normal conversation. Yes I feel the bz breach signifys when a quake will occur. Yes m class activity with 780km/s wonds should show activity. No not 8.0 activity. That was an eclipse multiplier. The 6.3 we saw was what we should have been expecting. 
Im a human. I get excoted and over assess things at times. Its called an exageration. </p>

<p>Me claming an 8.0 this test to me is beong conservative. I expect an 8.3- 9.0+- this will be due to the x class activity. 
No eclipse or multiplier involved. </p>

<p>You&#39;re assuring us! By constantly predicting big earthquakes, you are bound to be a broken clock at least once in the future. Especially with big windows. </p>

<p>But, it will be correlative and not causitive, and there is a huge difference. So, to prove your self and your model, you need to be right about more details than a big earthquake. You&#39;re gonna have to call the area and the magnitude. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have done some smaller quakes when testing zones. </p>

<p>To me its much easier to pair large solar events to large seismic events. My impression is start big and work toward smaller events. That way we arent accounting for all seismic event scenarios. More effectively focusing on the direct solar influencing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Way off, and like I said, when the little boy keeps crying wolf, eventually there will be wolves. But that doesn&#39;t mean he caused the wolves to come or predicted they would come. He simply knew they came, so if he kept saying they would come, eventually he would look correct.</p>

<p>Anyway, in order to claim this, you need to prove it mathematically then repeat it. Maybe with smaller ones.</p>

<p>Because you reiterated Japan and Nepal, so you&#39;re still wrong and this is still not in any way proved. </p>

<p>People were trying to bet this guy $100 on his last post (where he was equally confidence and where nothing happened). ParsingSol didn&#39;t take it, but multiple users wanted to (bet he&#39;d be incorrect).</p>

<p>This bet isn&#39;t about being convinced or not, it&#39;s not no one wants to see ParsingSol or anyone else on here on Gone Wild.</p>

<p>(for those not staying tuned September 6, 2017 @ 14:00 UTC Major Spaceweather Event (X9.3 Flare) / CME(Updated)
The largest solar flare of the current solar cycle 24 was just observed around region 2673. The massive event measuring X9.3 peaked at 12:02 UTC Wednesday. A Type II radio emission with an estimated velocity of 1969 km/s was recorded. A bright coronal mass ejection (CME) is visible in the latest STEREO Ahead imagery and will likely be directed our way. More to follow once Earth facing LASCO coronagraph imagery becomes available. Aurora sky watchers may be in for a treat later this week.
ALERT: Type II Radio Emission Begin Time: 2017 Sep 06 1202 UTC Estimated Velocity: 1969 km/s
Description: Type II emissions occur in association with eruptions on the sun and typically indicate a coronal mass ejection is associated with a flare event.
SUMMARY: 10cm Radio Burst Begin Time: 2017 Sep 06 1154 UTC Maximum Time: 2017 Sep 06 1156 UTC End Time: 2017 Sep 06 1157 UTC Duration: 3 minutes Peak Flux: 12000 sfu
September 6, 2017 @ 09:25 UTC X2.2 Flare! (Updated) Region 2673 just produced a nice X2.2 solar flare at approximately 09:10 UTC (Sept 6). This is the first X-Class event to be detected since May 2015. The active region is still in a decent position for Earth directed eruptions. More updates will be provided should a coronal mass ejection (CME) be associated. More to follow. Image courtesy of SDO/AIA.
the X2 solar flare did not appear to generate a noteworthy solar flare.

I have taken the 1 min mean Bz Data from NASAs ACE (the DSCOVR data portal is relay cancer) and compared them to earthquakes. <a href="http://imgur.com/HP3ArCn">http://imgur.com/HP3ArCn</a> Black points are earthquakes - Higher y-value -&gt; greater magnitude The y-Value for Bz data-points is the intensity of your so called &quot;breach&quot;. I assume the intensity of a &quot;breach&quot; is |Bt - Bz| The color shows the Bz value itself. The values have some shitty scale for comparison. The time frame is 01-01-17 to 08-28-17 There are really some intense earthquakes only days after a big &quot;breeches&quot; and high |Bz| values. Maybe there is a correlation. I didn&#39;t run any statistic tests, so my guess is so good as yours. And of course don&#39;t forget: &quot;Correlation does not imply causation.&quot; At least this does not obviously contradict your theory. 2017, 2015-2016 2011
I had 2011 processed early. I am not giving a projected location this year.
The projection is for a 8.0-9.5 magnitude quake.
I&#39;ve included all processed data showing the correlation between b&#39;s breaches and seismic events known to date. Most years showing a consistent relationship.
If you are good at statistical analysis we could use your help. Please pm me.
So ya.
I literally think 8.0 is easy this time around kids...
It&#39;s coming. A week tops- So 7day warning;</p>

<p>You were 100% wrong and you have proven your theory is a bunch of bullshit. All you do is guess. Many commentators have shown how easy it is to guess the way you do. Pick an active zone - don&#39;t be too specific, wide time frame and something around 6.0 earthquake. </p>

<p>Many times those people were much better than you in those guesses. I really can&#39;t believe some people still buy your bullshit. I&#39;m speculating half the comments are your alt-accounts just so you can feel better about yourself.</p>

<p>Why do people keep saying that? Of course it matters. When all of those 4Chan posts about &quot;massive arrests starting tomorrow&quot; kept being wrong, people eventually stopped listening to them and posting them here. If something keeps being passed off as &quot;absolutely true this time, for real guys&quot; and keeps failing to deliver, why would anyone bother listening anymore. Like I&#39;ve said before, I liked these posts at first but until they actually start producing accurate results (more accurate than random guessing) I&#39;m really not sure why anyone keeps falling for them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a good case that ParsingSol has shown no correlation. The difference is the result isn&#39;t as consequential to me. Him being <em>wrong</em> is good too. Having organized and analyzed graphs can be beneficial by itself.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, 4chan posts about &quot;massive arrests starting tomorrow&quot; rely solely on the outcome. There is no back work that is beneficial, hence a lesser desire to read up on it.</p>

<p>Additionally, space is cool, CME are cool, flares are cool, earthquakes are cool, SECCHI and SOHO are cool. Quite simply just personal preference. </p>

<p>Politics isn&#39;t cool and I think many are tired of them.This is why I&#39;d rather read his likely wrong prediction(I am indeed skeptical of it).</p>

<p>Showing that a model is wrong is a very important part of science, and it&#39;s still respectable when you learn this. But my problem with him (I&#39;m not the guy you&#39;ve replied to) is that he doesn&#39;t have any set criteria for a failed hypothesis, not in terms of time window, area of effect or anything. And he doesn&#39;t seem to collect any data for his predictions versus reality either. </p>

<p>So he just keeps going without being able to conclusively and scientifically say whether his predictions have been accurate over time. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good points. ParsingSol did not actually provide any data for his 8.0-9.5 Earthquake prediction(my mentioned skepticism in my prior post). I assumed he was keeping data, but that is just an assumption.</p>

<p>I scoured his past posts and read the his <a href="https://www.scribd.com/mobile/document/335723937/Advanced-Seismic-Prediction-via-Solar-Wind-Velocity">Seismic Prediction essay</a>. I found posts attempting to design a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ParsingSol/comments/6sophi/first_step_towards_database_design/">database</a> for comparison and specific cases of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ParsingSol/comments/6keqkj/all_seismic_events_2013/">CME and earthquake overlap</a>. I was disappointed to not see any statistical analysis or any original data besides the case study of events.</p>

<p>He also does himself a disservice by exaggerating. He says he is progressing and I wouldn&#39;t dissuade him from posting these. I admired <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6yhv3l/the_ultimate_earthquake_test_is_about_to_commence/dmnmfig/">Th3_Admiral&#39;s approach</a> when he confronted ParingSol about being precise on the timetable and scale.</p>

<p>I would still not attack him over this and let those who enjoy this content to enjoy it in peace.</p>

<p>If you keep predicting things eventually you will get something somewhat right.

    <div class="md"><p>Once I saw the news about this flare I immediately looked up to see what your prediction was :). It&#39;s always a balance of hoping your right vs not wanting areas to be devastated by giant earthquakes. After the last big flare we didn&#39;t get a serious earthquake, but we did get two of the strongest tropical cyclones in recent memory. Do you think that solar flares could be affecting the weather just as much as seismic movement? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Even if there were to be an 8.0+ or higher, this still proves nothing you know that right? If it did mean something you should be able to go back to previous sun events like this one and link them to major earthquakes happening. Have you done that yet? Any historical data to back up this current claim? </p>

<p>If past sun events like this one don&#39;t have major earthquakes after them, then a major earthquake this time is more in line as a random event... a fluke... not related.</p>

<p>What ever the circumstances were for 3.11. I would lower then by 25%. Thats what I would suggest. If this test is poaitive prepare for that scenario. 
1 week of being prepared may seem significant now. However I hope this will be all for something. Meaning that my posts hold validity. So its not that I want to see anyone harmed or an event to occur. I merely feel that under these circumstances its unavoidable. So preparing to meet it stands a more effective option. (should this theory be found correct). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If this test goes well. Any chance you would wanna instruct me in the program your using to process data for 2012-2014. And 2016. </p>

<p>I will do the work. I just need to be told how :)</p>

<p>I am planning on stepping up as soon as I get my computer back. I thiught that would happen yesterday. But alas it will take another week. :(</p>

<p>All your help and consideration means a lot to me. I linked you in the thread to give your work credit. But I&#39;d like to truly say thank you sincerely for your participation. 
Your the real genius here. I just see a relationship we humans may be able to exploit. 
Technically. You could likely tell me more about that then me. But please base your answer on the outcome of this current test. 
It should be a good one. I think we both know that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can try to explain it to you, and give you the source i used. That is no problem. Send me a message when you get a computer.</p>

<p>If you cite someone, you should always give the whole picture. You should have included that i did not see correlation in other years. </p>

<p>Whatever happens in the next 7 days isn&#39;t a test for your model. </p>

<ul>
<li>Lets assume your model is right, and a 8.4 happens.<br/>
-&gt; We can&#39;t distinguish it  from guessing. A singe hit with a 3.99% positive outcome isn&#39;t really impressive. </li>
<li>Lets assume your model is mostly right, and nothing notable happens.<br/>

<li>Lets assume your model is wrong, and a 8.4 happens.

<p>So you really should not see something like this as a test. You have to assist many events like this. For that you need a formal model - not these incoherent posts -  and test it with data from the past.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. 
My understanding is the better I do at these general assessments. The more ability I have as a single user to impress others upon the world that the tasks worth exploring. 
Im rather optionless to move forward without dedicating my time to exploring as I do. These posts lead to the creation of my subreddit where we met afterall. </p>

<p>What I expect to happen and havibg said it before hand greatly impresses that the time we are taking is not wasted. While its very small steps ahead. To me its more important to be walking forward slowly then to be taking no steps at all. 
I just do this because it seems relevant and pure. I don&#39;t know a better thing to dedicate my free time too. 
Life is fickle, these times are hard. 
I merely like to help others, and hope someday to make a &#39;name for myself&#39;. 
Mainly wanting my daughter to be proud I achieved something in my life time. So I dedicate time into making the posts in hopes the time is well spent. So even though I agree its not 10o% proof. Its a step in the right direction. One of the few steps I can truly take (at my knowing)  which produces the results I wish to inherit. </p>

<p>I merely think this will work. Not on all seosmoc events. But a great deal of the worst ones. Which do correlate. To me thats a magnificent achievement in my lifetime. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>cme&#39;s and coronal hole streams with high intensity impacts are responsible for some of earths largest seismic events. Typically the winds key is extremely relevant provided above. However as mentioned in the comments. More often then not multiple events (cme&#39;s) are produced which makes the events less likely to follow a direct cause effect relationship. </p>

<p>Its as though the energy dissipates as continued activity pushes the event outside its normal routine. I think this happened my first test. Or second. We had nearly 12 hours late arrival. (With a mildly Lowered seismic event.) Yet it gives reasoning that the cause effect is susceptible to time expansion via the bz&#39;s active state. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>When you say high intensity impacts, what is doing the impacting and which body, the sun or earth?</p></li>
<li><p>I thought this was a theory and you were evaluating data to determine whether the evidence supports the theory, but your first statement indicates that you theory is proven fact. Is that the case?</p></li>
<li><p>You say that more CME&#39;s reduces the effect that you are studying (earthquakes in this case), that would seem to undermine the theory. If A causes B, then more A should lead to more B right? What are your thoughts on this?</p></li>
<li><p>If a CME = significant seismic event, what is the time frame that would support your theory (e.g. +/- 12 hours, 24 hours, 3 days, etc.) and what time frame would be seen as unrelated? </p></li>
<li><p>Given that seismic activity and earthquakes are occurring constantly is there a minimum magnitude for the expected earthquake that occurs after a CME?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Very interesting stuff, the idea that events on the sun exert an influence on earth&#39;s gravity (and therefore seismic activity) seems at least plausible. It would be interesting for us laymen to understand how much force a large CME sends to earth in a non technical way. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I give an initial assessment of wind speeds expected per somar intrusion. I literally assess / estimate: the wind speeds, strike of the cme. Proton density, and the quake which would follow such an event / breach. </p>

<p>Ive noticed that during some tests multiple cme&#39;s will occur. If the eq. Is not produced in the initial uptick it typically comes at the point a bz breach is active. I consider this a period that electrons are transfering through the flux system. During this period If more inteusions take place the bz can renain open hours or days. While seismic activity may occur. The main quakes appear to lose their expected intensity. Its as though they are weakened over time. 
Thus the expansion of time appears by my own personal observation appears to weaken these events. </p>

<p>I feel this is an important factor in my model and that if we continually monitor the legnth of events (seismic) and the height / intensity of plasma / geomagbetic storms. Conparing the two as a &#39;cause / effect&#39; relationship. Qe will have a better understanding of how the live data will shape the incoming quakes as past archives may suggest various locations and intensity. </p>

<p>I.e. If we measure 3 incoming m-flares with cmes between 2014-2015. Each triggers a specific quake (5.5 in italy). Then the next m flare. (could hit italy). </p>

<p>However measuring the exact time which takes place during the cause effect may give us a better understanding of when a quake like the one I assessed will come. </p>

<p>In my experience its the bz componet which closes allowing for a quake to occur. So if it remains open a week. Typically a 8.0 will reduce to a 5.0 (over / in that time). </p>

<p>My goal was always to image the above provided data with a pro analytics firm to see how many quajes followed. Measuring the time and intensity in hopes we could extract values which would lead to the creation of an advanced seismic detection system. 
Once we process 1997-2017 we will have 20 years of comparative data with thousands of potential data sets to run against the live feed. </p>

<p>At that point the live feed would be fed through the algorithm which would scan for data which compliments past imaging. If it sees similar data which compliments a known past event. It can warn an operator of the significanct comparison which may provide warning of an upcoming event. </p>

<p>Seemed like a really easy thing to design. I imagine if we had a probability mechanism added with eq frequencys via past events it would greatly expand the devices efficiency. </p>

<p>So its a two level system. Probability vs. Solar. Likely to assess many of earths greatest quakes in advance. Furthermore taking me (the emotional human operator) out of its assessment. As what I hope to see is likely not within the data to begin with. 
What I do is attempt to do this job. But 20 years of data is some potential 200 killiin events in its entirety. So I doubt I will ever be a fully useful service. In that respect. </p>

<p>There is just so much we do know, that we arent using to our advantage. :/</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ParsingSol/comments/6iztw3/solar_data_here/djb58ob/">Back here, you posted the basis of what you&#39;re looking for</a></p>

<p>and gave this screen shot as an example: <a href="http://imgur.com/a/S8eR9">http://imgur.com/a/S8eR9</a></p>

<p>And now, today we are seeing the current storm upgraded to a G4 class event, Bz/Bt opening up and the solar wind speed increasing. Todays data that I&#39;ve annotated for everyone: </p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/a/NUilr">http://imgur.com/a/NUilr</a></p>

<p>So, if you are right. This data arguably <em>perfectly</em> matches what you are looking for. </p>

<p>I do accept though that the theory is only that an event is significantly more likely but not guaranteed to occur. I also, as a disclaimer, disgree <em>entirely</em> with your method for determining location and in fact <em>most</em> of your theory of interaction as it is largely non-scientific (location is probability based I get that, but that&#39;s not explicitly useful). I do however like and agree with the underlying idea that solar events may trigger earthquakes - though I believe this is only due to placing additonal stress on already stressed areas increasing the likelihood of a rupture. Seismic events are ultimately caused by seismic stress between surfaces and ruptures can and do occur regardless of solar activity, and solar activity does not indicate a rupture <em>will</em> occur.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>See thats where I think the magic happens. Magnetic induction via particle absorbtion of the planetary flux tubes. &quot;Like a flower needs being polinated&quot; the magnetosphere likely needs electric charge. Weve recorded pulsations from cmes in flux tubes seeing the same pulsatins in the magnetic field lines that encompasses the magnetosphere. So high voltage absorbtion isnt out of the question. That plasma is made of photons and ions really.<br/>
Look at aurorea borealis. So why wouldn&#39;t system overloads cause shorts. Like earthquake lights and ruptures. But there is a process between these two events. Earthquakes and seismic data. So why not define a better system of assessment. </p>

<p>Wonder if related to the earthquake - if so most likely an emission causing interference with detection equipment. Maybe related to earthquake lights in the sky that can occur independent of electrical malfunction (e.g there are historical records of flashing in the sky during quakes that predates electricity)</p>

<p>It&#39;s interesting nonetheless </p>

    <div class="md"><p>From your very own link, re: earthquake lights, so you’re Smithsonian link is telling me the ion/magnetosphere interacts with rocks in the ground..? You don’t say.. ;)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Over the past few decades, a variety of hypothesis have been offered. Some have proposed that tectonic movement of rocks that include quartz could generate a pizoelectric field that produces flashes of light. Others have suggested that tectonic stress temporarily allows rocks to conduct electromagnetic energy, triggering changes in the magnetic charge of the ionosphere, the uppermost level of the atmosphere. But it&#39;s extremely hard to test either of these hypotheses, because earthquakes are so unpredictable, and the conditions are so difficult to replicate in a lab.</p>

<p>He&#39;s a redditor, mainly active to a specific subreddit, posting thoughts/theories he finds interest in. People en masse aren&#39;t dictating their lives on his work and he doesn&#39;t claim to be a professional or presenting flawless information. He saw the x9 and other variables he deemed relevant and made a prediction based on a system he believes in / is working on.</p>

<p>Who fucking cares if he didn&#39;t name the exact city and time and magnitude and damage done? He claimed an 8.0+ is coming within 7 days and it did.</p>

<p>If it bothers you so much, just piss off. Some people find what he&#39;s doing interesting and should that amount to nothing, so be it. It&#39;s their choice to be as engaged with it as they like.</p>

<p>If he was on television, broadcasted to millions, claiming all of this to be 100% accurate, I&#39;d be on your side but he&#39;s not. It&#39;s a hobby of his that may very well start up conversations and influence others to look into the correlation of solar activity and how it affects the earth.</p>

<p>Let him try and let us who enjoy watching him publicly do so, do so.</p>

Not even two weeks ago his later-failing prediction was described by him as one that would completely change his field. As others have stated, if he could apply his method to previous events of high solar activity and show any causality, maybe there would be legitimacy, but failure to do that and his repeated predictive failures makes for a more than skeptical view from me.</p>

<p>Which sort of morphed into this one predicting the largest quake of 2016-2017. It was supposed to follow some massive solar activity that was 100% guaranteed a sure sign of a really big upcoming quake. His 36 hour window passed with no major quakes at all. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s one for a 7.0+ quake in New Zealand that I don&#39;t think ever happened either.</p>

<p>These are just his three most recent predictions. You&#39;d have to dig a bit further to find one before last night&#39;s that was even close to accurate. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No he didn&#39;t. He&#39;s made a number of false predictions for sometime. Eventually he was going to get it &#39;right&#39;. </p>

<p>He predicted the wrong area, and gave a range of a large earthquake. </p>

<p>He hasn&#39;t used historic data to validate his theory. </p>

<p>Please understand this for what is it is; </p>

<p><strong>A fluke</strong></p>

<hr/>

<p>Misinformation like this post, dutchsinse etc claim to have abilities to predict these events, which people flock to because of how scary it can be. I understand that. I really do because I used to be like that before I realised how bullshit that was. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, it&#39;s fear mongering. It&#39;s causing constant concern and in the end, when nothing happens, it can create disbelief in the actual dangers of these events. </p>

<p>So again, he didn&#39;t call it, he got lucky. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, I see the comment post now. Thanks for explaining.</p>

<p>But look at the context, he&#39;s not saying &quot;It&#39;s going to be here!&quot;. Rather:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>but if you were to expect an 8.0-9.5 eq I&#39;d assess:
Japan, Nepal, Chile, New Zealand, Philippians, Tonga, Mexico city, or Turkey.
To me these are the most typical regions to display this Intensity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Basically, he&#39;s saying to just consider those locations...and turns out Mexico City is actually a hit.</p>

<p>By itself, the location data could be seen as a broad guess, but you have to factor in that he also called the magnitude and timing pretty darned well. </p>

<p>The.problem is he either has no, or refused to publish a, concrete model, nor has any data correlating his predictions to actual events. All i see is tenuous explanations as to why they dont occur (Time Dilation/Eclipse/etc), Vague grasps on location (Where either the locations cover virtually the whole ring of fire, or thousands of km away is &#39;accurate&#39;), and just a plain misunderstanding of the data he claims to interpret.</p>

<p>This is all masked behind excuses of not having enough money, or the technology to apparently form a basic verifiable model.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just honestly wondering, because I looked up this guy as soon as I saw the earthquake and he predicted it right again, could you take 10 predictions and get two earthquakes right within days even hours and correct magnitude to prove this guy is wrong? A broke clock is right twice a day but at what point is a person more right than broke clock twice a day? I never visit this somewhat awful sub but this is the second time this guy&#39;s been right in like six months and I think it&#39;s pretty incredible. And every time there are people acting like they could predict earthquakes if they had ten or fifteen quesses </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right and they&#39;re assuming it&#39;s just random but if I randomly guessed when an earthquake would be you really think I could guess magnitude and within hours/days of an earthquake? I passed this guy&#39;s posts months ago and his prediction was right on but of course he was wrong on the location, needs some work there. But you really think there&#39;s no correlation between solar events and his predictions at this point? I&#39;m guessing there&#39;s a third factor he&#39;s not aware of that makes his predictions seem off because he can&#39;t tell when the two combine to create an event but he appears to either be really good at guessing or on to something. I was wondering if he guesses so often that anyone could get it right or if he&#39;s on to a single factor that could create geological events like this one. Everyone just seems so sure he&#39;s wrong or right its hard to tell if it&#39;s random or not.  </p>

<p>If there is he has no idea what it is.</p>

<p>Just like when these sunspots appeared...I could have made a post saying that &quot;X-Class solar flares will hit earth in the next few days&quot; but it&#39;d be a shot in the dark. Say they didn&#39;t hit earth, ok, next time I wait for a sunspot to appear and keep calling it out again and again until something DOES happen. That&#39;s like this post with your &quot;bz&quot; and &quot;breach data&quot;, every time it gets higher you say an earthquake is going to happen and eventually keep going until it hits the target. Now that you found your shot, you are going to keep telling yourself &quot;Damn, I&#39;m right, there&#39;s something to this model!&quot; and when you fail your next one you are just gonna say &quot;Huh well it was right before, probably just needs some adjusting&quot; and continue on with your predictions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I at first thought this post had some legitimacy but then I got skeptical. I&#39;m not demeaning the work... any work is open to criticism via opinion, and like I stated to someone else&#39;s reply, without opposing facts or opinions; science would never get anywhere. Take physics for example, our current understanding of it is changing of it all the time because of people&#39;s view on how things work. </p>

<p>Also you can&#39;t even prove this model works off 1 prediction coming true based on the model... after many predictions preceded it. Any sort of experiment has to go through so much trial and error to have any conclusive data/evidence. I&#39;m just trying to say, you can&#39;t take something like this and call it &quot;proof&quot; after many failed predictions before this. I&#39;m not saying no there&#39;s nothing behind this guys prediction, but what I am saying is that this is %100 not proof and <em>could</em> just be a lucky guess.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lmfao people are actually impressed by this? Holy fuck. This guy makes many predictions in which 99% fail. He even guessed like 10 areas where this 8-9.5 earthquake will strike. And now it happens in Mexico and idiots think he&#39;s a genius or something? Lol. Now if he keeps calling them correctly then I&#39;ll be impressed. This is luck and not hard to do considering he makes predictions every day lol </p>

    <div class="md"><p>im looking at this, and it seems the model is mostly (or completely) a correlation between solar activity intensity and earthquake intensity. the reason OP couldn&#39;t predict location is that the model does not consider location in it&#39;s correlations. </p>

<p>Also, I don&#39;t buy OP&#39;s hypothesis about the cause. sorry, OP. I am still very impressed by how you found a correlation and produced a predictive model where nobody else was looking.</p>

<p>this post, along with the the earthquake lights confirmations, are going to lead to some very interesting breakthroughs and hypothesis confirmations.</p>

<p>my thoughts are all about the magnetosphere (and by extension, the magnetic core of the planet) interacting with the magnetic solar activity and basically shuddering the core so that plate faults with more stress are likely to slip. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey u/ParsingSol I would love your insight on the &quot;Earthquake Lights&quot; Phenomena. With the potential to connect CMEs with Earthquakes would this also explain events like this? <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Plumasatomicas/videos/1883331828594766/?hc_ref=ARR4kOKMIZM-s3yq92oGBxM66I3rnk-3ipQ9a04OP3NwfT87JVoPsFsFPLPo66DdMwc&amp;amp;pnref=story">warning facebook video link</a> </p>

<p>I 100% admit I don&#39;t fully understand the science in everything involved here but is it possible that as the CME connects with the earths Atmosphere (penetrating to a certain point?) it could cause these types of lights? We already know it&#39;ll impact the aurora borealis. </p>

<p>tl;dr between 1986 and 2008 the correlation between intense geomagnetic fields and intense earthquakes was 0.116 at max.  1 would be &quot;totally correlated with each other&quot; and 0 would be &quot;totally random&quot;, so the relationship between them is pretty darn close to totally random.</p>

<p>While I am supportive of anyone trying to better understand seismic risks, patterns and such, I am more passionate about fighting misinformation. There is no such thing as earthquake prediction. No agency in the world has been able to do it, even with millions of dollars in backing money. Scientific research projects looking into these relationships have come up with nothing substantial. </p>

<hr/>

<p>He&#39;s made a number of false predictions for sometime. Eventually he was going to get it &#39;right&#39;. </p>

<p>He predicted the wrong area, and gave a range of a large earthquake. </p>

<p>He hasn&#39;t used historic data to validate his theory. </p>

<p><strong>A fluke</strong></p>

<p>Misinformation like this post, dutchsinse etc claim to have abilities to predict these events, which people flock to because of how scary it can be. I understand that. I really do because I used to be like that before I realised how bullshit that was. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, it&#39;s fear mongering. It&#39;s causing constant concern and in the end, when nothing happens, it can create disbelief in the actual dangers of these events. </p>

<p>Calling out something for what it is and then providing source materials is a good way to back up what you are saying... But you haven&#39;t done that. You are simply a reddit username that gathered attention for reposting information from the internet. You don&#39;t actually provide any original content in any of your posts besides your personal opinion. </p>

<p>If you want to downplay something because you feel science has thoroughly studied, applied theories, that were then proven to be false and the scientific community agreed with said results, great! But I can&#39;t find any shred of that evidence currently. Otherwise you are no better than <a href="/u/ParsingSol">/u/ParsingSol</a> and actually you are worse for downplaying something you can&#39;t reference to as proven debunked form of prediction model for earthquakes.</p>

But we saw that from 2011 - 2014 their accuracy got better, probably due to better prediction models, historical data and more accurate tools to better predict the weather patterns that most likely produce tornados! Which is awesome. So in a matter of 4 years they took a system of prediction with an accuracy of around 30%(2007-2011) and increased it to about 70%(2011-2014)</p>

<p><a href="/u/parsingsol">/u/parsingsol</a> had another username before this current one, I can&#39;t remember what it was. But I think with the combination of the two accounts and if my memory is some what accurate, he is probably sitting around 20-30 predictions and 1 accurate! Which looks rough and I will agree with anyone who says so. But I&#39;m trying to keep in mind that this is a amateur trying to prove a theory with an amateur scientific method. So in terms of test data vs time its still a very immature test model. Which doesn&#39;t make his predictions accurate or right! Just makes it unclear until we can verify more test data over a longer period of time. </p>

<p>At least that is how I&#39;m approaching it. </p>

<p>Sure thing! Weather is a very big side passion of mine so I love digging into anything related to it! </p>

<p>For uparsingsol previous account for historical data, unfortunately I think we are a screwed for tracking. I don&#39;t know exactly what happened and I respected his privacy during our PM&#39;s while discussing his reasoning for wiping the account clean. Once I realized he had started a using a new account.  He mentioned their was personal risk involved if he kept using that account. (personal I think he might have been doxxed). If you read through his posts he isn&#39;t very good at articulating his sentences, he&#39;s just fucking amazing at crunching numbers. So I didn&#39;t want to press. But I can tell you that he hasn&#39;t been predicting for 5 years. His previous account was considerably old (maybe 3-4 years) but he didn&#39;t start <strong>publicly predicting</strong> till about a year +/- 6 months ago. I mentioned my 2-4 years in my previous comment since that is what he mentioned to me during our PM&#39;s. I&#39;m hoping he has that data recorded. Cause it could end up being pretty invaluable. </p>

<p>Also if you are interested in this and want to follow / research a little more into it: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTiL1q9YbrVam5nP2xzFTWQ">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTiL1q9YbrVam5nP2xzFTWQ</a></p>

<p>Take a look at that channel. If you google the channel name the guy has a website and a decently active forum of people discussing this very idea around planets/moons/sun and any other celestial activity and it&#39;s potential influence on earthly events. Pretty interesting shit. </p>

<p>Well, there&#39;s this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>All the data is publicly available, so I did some rather ghetto correlation analysis on historical earthquakes and solar wind info.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/icefoxen/quakes/">https://github.com/icefoxen/quakes/</a></p>

<p>tl;dr between 1986 and 2008 the correlation between intense geomagnetic fields and intense earthquakes was 0.116 at max. 1 would be &quot;totally correlated with each other&quot; and 0 would be &quot;totally random&quot;, so the relationship between them is pretty darn close to totally random.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, I see the comment post now. Thanks for explaining.</p>

<p>But look at the context, he&#39;s not saying &quot;It&#39;s going to be here!&quot;. Rather:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>but if you were to expect an 8.0-9.5 eq I&#39;d assess:
Japan, Nepal, Chile, New Zealand, Philippians, Tonga, Mexico city, or Turkey.
To me these are the most typical regions to display this Intensity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Basically, he&#39;s saying to just consider those locations...and turns out Mexico City is actually a hit.</p>

<p>By itself, the location data could be seen as a broad guess, but you have to factor in that he also called the magnitude and timing pretty darned well. </p>
