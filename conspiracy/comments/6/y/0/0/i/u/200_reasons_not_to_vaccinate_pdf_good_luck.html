<p>Dont trust authority especially when theyve been caught lying.</p>

<p>Vaccine producing companies can NOT BE HELD LIABLE AT ALL.</p>

<p>You should not be injecting things like mercury into a developing baby (logic says)</p>

<p>Also if vaccine was so good they would not try to make non vaxxers vax. What, why vaccinr yourself if you think you can still catch it from others.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can only sue after you try litigation. You can only sue if you decline the offer of settlement. If you decline the offer, you will never get another one. If you sue, the company&#39;s lawyers will stretch the timeline past your budget.</p>

<p>The bottom line remains, there is no liability for a company that creates a vaccine as a response to an emergency situation. For instance Merk cannot be sued for all of the harm it&#39;s Anthrax Vaccine caused, because Congress conveniently declared a state of emergency for Anthrax in 2001. This was an attempt to ramp up for war against Iraq, while it also made a small company owned by a senator tonnes of money, when the price of the vaccine went from 3 dollars to over a hundred, overnight.</p>

<p>This debate is about far more than people are willing to dig through. For the record I am pro-safe-vaccine. I am very against forced vaccinations, as companies and the government have a very bad track record of not using these sort of powers for the good of all, and rather using them to selectively target people for toxic exposure testing and other human guinea pig type stuff.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>You can only sue after you try litigation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s like saying, &quot;you can only sue after you try to sue.&quot; If you aren&#39;t familiar with what &quot;litigation&quot; means, you may not be fully informed as to how this works.</p>

<p>In fact, you&#39;re wrong. Holmes v. Merck shows how even a minimally competent lawyer can bring claims totally outside the VICP, not subject to its preclusion or separate requirements. The trial court in that case found that the plaintiffs brought state law claims that were not subject to the federal act at all, and the appellate court affirmed. No court has disagreed with this reasoning, as far as I&#39;m aware.</p>

<p>The idea that no one can sue vaccine makers is an anti-vax myth. Like a lot of anti-vax myths, it&#39;s <em>very</em> resistant to basic facts. The basic fact here is that parents can sue and have sued vaccine makers for damages allegedly caused by vaccines. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude, you are wrong. You have to go through the program first, and if the claim is denied by either party, then and only then can a lawsuit happen. This is because of laws that protect vaccine manufacturers from liability.</p>

<p>See, <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine_injury">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine_injury</a></p>

<p>&quot;The VICP uses a no-fault, streamlined system for litigating vaccine injury claims.[7] Claims that are denied can be pursued through civil lawsuits, though this is rare.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Every time this happens--I point out the basic fact, and an anti-vaxer chimes in with a misinformed &quot;Nuh uh! Actually...&quot;</p>

<p>Read. The. Case. Holmes v. Merck is an <em>example</em> of parents suing the pharma company, in which the court <em>explicitly stated</em> that the majority of their claims were not subject to the VICA. </p>

<p>The language you cited is pointing out that claims that the VICP denies can be pursued through civil suits, <em>not</em> that all civil suits have to be routed through the VICP. It is true that some civil claims must be so routed, but not all of them. Again, Holmes v. Merck not only explains this, it is an actual example of what you&#39;re saying can&#39;t happen.</p>

<p>I realize that you were told otherwise. I know that. The anti-vax blogs are not a trustworthy source of information about this, or other related subjects. </p>

<p>There are vaccines that are unsafe. Vaccines shouldn&#39;t be forced on people by principle.

<p>Actually there is a lot of good information out there. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is. Good information doesn&#39;t come from people online spreading anti-vax myths, though. If you aren&#39;t familiar with the law here, you aren&#39;t informed enough to discriminate between the good information and the bad. </p>

<p>My point here is to try to stop the spread of the bad information, that it&#39;s impossible to sue pharma or that pharma is immune from liability. It&#39;s tough, because whenever you try to tell people that, guys like you feel the need to jump up and spread more disinformation.</p>

<p>Equivocate between us all you like. Just please don&#39;t spread bullshit online. There&#39;s enough out there already.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you can quote the bullshit you suppose that I am spreading, I would be all ears. Unfortunately, you are misrepresenting what I said. I didnt once say you are wrong. I didnt once say nobody can sue. I claimed that people cannot sue until they go through VICS. I was wrong, but noy by much, because a lawsuit is still a very rare thing. So you don&#39;t even have much of a point and you are arguing againt what people say rather than what I say. Thats unfair to me, and it is intellectually dishonest.</p>

<p>So if you are quite done talking about talking, we can either actually talk about something, or just stop. It would be great though, if you would stop calling me names and invalidating my point.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are missing the point. I wasnt wrong that the litigation works that way. I was wrong that there was no other avenue for a lawsuit. You are really splitting hairs. Now do you want to have a debate or not? You seem to just want to sit on top of your single point. You have no argument do you?</p>

<p>You&#39;re also misusing the word &quot;litigation.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, so you don&#39;t want to debate any other point?</p>

<p>How about the one where Merk Pharma is currently embroiled in 2 lawsuits with 4 ex employees who allege they have documented evidence that Merk faked safety and efficacy data for over 20 years to retain patents?</p>

The only exception to someone needing to get vaccinated is those who are unable to do so due to a compromised immune system or some allergen concern etc.
Done, next question.</p>
