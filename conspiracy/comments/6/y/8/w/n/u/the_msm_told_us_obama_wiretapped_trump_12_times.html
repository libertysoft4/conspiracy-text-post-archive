        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The (now defunct) Heat Street, Nov 7 2016:
EXCLUSIVE: FBI ‘Granted FISA Warrant’ Covering Trump Camp’s Ties To Russia. Two separate sources with links to the counter-intelligence community have confirmed to Heat Street that the FBI sought, and was granted, a FISA court warrant in October, giving counter-intelligence permission to examine the activities of ‘american persons’ in Donald Trump’s campaign with ties to Russia.
If you are wondering who Heat Street is and why you should care, just know that the NYT <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/17/opinion/what-to-ask-about-russian-hacking.html">republished this information</a> in March: you know, the information that the Obama administration spied on Team Trump.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/10/fbi-chief-given-dossier-by-john-mccain-alleging-secret-trump-russia-contacts">The Guardian, Jan 11 2017:</a>
The Guardian has learned that the FBI applied for a warrant from the FISA court over the summer in order to monitor four members of the Trump team suspected of irregular contacts with Russian officials. The FISA court turned down the application, asking FBI counter-intelligence investigators to narrow its focus. According to one report, the FBI was finally granted a warrant in October, but that has not been confirmed, and it is not clear whether any warrant led to a full investigation.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/12/us/politics/nsa-gets-more-latitude-to-share-intercepted-communications.html">The NYT, Jan 12 2017:</a>
In its final days, the Obama administration has expanded the power of the NSA to share globally intercepted personal communications with the government’s 16 other intelligence agencies before applying privacy protections. The new rules significantly relax long-standing limits on what the NSA may do with the information gathered by its most powerful surveillance operations, which are largely unregulated by pindo wiretapping laws. These include collecting satellite transmissions, phone calls and emails that cross network switches abroad, and messages between people abroad that cross domestic network switches.
Note the timing of “in the final days of the Obama administration.” As I wrote at the Daily Wire in March, where I first published this list, this is the most important piece of the puzzle, because it explains how the media was getting all of its scoops via leaks via surveillance.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-38589427">BBC, Jan 17 2017:</a> Lawyers from the National Security Division in the DoJ then drew up an application. They took it to the secret FISA court. They wanted permission to intercept the electronic records from two Russian banks. Their first application, in June, was rejected outright by the judge. They returned with a more narrowly drawn order in July and were rejected again. Finally, before a new judge, the order was granted, on Oct 15, three weeks before election day. Neither Mr Trump nor his associates are named in the FISA order, which would only cover foreign citizens or foreign entities: in this case the Russian banks. But ultimately, the investigation is looking for transfers of money from Russia to America, each one, if proved, a felony offence. A lawyer outside the DoJ but familiar with the case told me that three of Mr Trump’s associates were the subject of the inquiry. “But it’s clear this is about Trump,” he said.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.dailywire.com/news/14756/12-pieces-proof-msm-knew-obama-spied-trump-and-john-nolte">McClatchy, Jan 18 2017:</a>
The agencies involved in the inquiry are the FBI, the CIA, the NSA, the DoJ, the Treasury Dept’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network and the ODNI, the sources said. … A key mission of the six-agency group has been to examine who financed the email hacks of the DNC + Podesta. WikiLeaks released the emails last summer and in October. The working group is scrutinizing the activities of a few Americans who were affiliated with Trump’s campaign or his business empire and of multiple individuals from Russia and other former Soviet nations. The BBC reported that the FBI had obtained a warrant on Oct.15&gt; from the FISA Court allowing investigators access to bank records and other documents about potential payments and money transfers related to Russia. One of McClatchy’s sources confirmed the report.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/19/us/politics/trump-russia-associates-investigation.html">The NYT, Jan 19 2017:</a>
WIRETAPPED DATA USED IN INQUIRY OF TRUMP AIDES … The FBI is leading the investigations, aided by the NSA, the CIA and the Treasury Dept’s financial crimes unit. The investigators have accelerated their efforts in recent weeks but have found no conclusive evidence of wrongdoing, the officials said. One official said intelligence reports based on some of the wiretapped communications had been provided to the White House.
Yes, that’s right, the Times used WIRETAP in its headline and in its story.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/national-security-adviser-flynn-discussed-sanctions-with-russian-ambassador-despite-denials-officials-say/2017/02/09/f85b29d6-ee11-11e6-b4ff-ac2cf509efe5_story.html">WaPo, Feb 9 2017:</a>
National security adviser Michael Flynn privately discussed pindo sanctions against Russia with that country’s ambassador to America during the month before Pres Trump took office, contrary to public assertions by Trump officials, current and former pindo boxtops said. Flynn’s communications with Sergei Kislyak were interpreted by some senior pindo boxtops as an inappropriate and potentially illegal signal to the Kremlin that it could expect a reprieve from sanctions that were being imposed by the Obama administration in late December to punish Russia for its alleged interference in the 2016 election.
“Flynn’s communications with Kislyak were interpreted.”</p>

<p><a href="http://money.cnn.com/2017/02/14/media/michael-flynn-investigative-journalism/">CNN, Feb 14 2017:</a>
The NYT quickly matched the story and said there was a transcript of the discussions.
This is CNN celebrating Flynn being taken down by a transcript of a phone call that the NYT reported on in a story that used the word “wiretap” under a headline that declared it a “wiretap.”</p>

<p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/02/10/us-official-confirms-trump-advisor-flynn-talked-sanctions-with-russian-ambassador-before-inauguration-nbc.html">NBC News, Feb 10 2017:</a>
A pindo intel boxtop briefed on the matter confirmed to NBC News that National Security Advisor Mike Flynn discussed sanctions with the Russian ambassador before Flynn took office… (He) said he was told there was no quid pro quo and that there has been no finding inside the government that Flynn did anything illegal.
Flynn spoke to Kislyak on Dec 29, the same day the sanctions were announced. NBC News was well aware of the fact that the Obama administration was listening in on Flynn’s calls. And as you will read below, so was AP, ABC and CBS.</p>

<p><a href="https://apnews.com/59644838458b43b8a81de720698a71f6/latest-trump-evaluating-flynn-russia-situation">AP, Feb 13 2017:</a>
Two people familiar with the situation say the Justice Dept warned the Trump administration about Michael Flynn’s contacts with Russia. One of the people says the Justice Dept told the administration there was a discrepancy between what the White House was saying publicly about Flynn’s contacts and the facts of what occurred.</p>

<p>ABC News, Feb 13 2017:
Embattled National Security Adviser Michael Flynn called Vice Pres Pence Friday to apologize for misleading him about a conversation with the Russian ambassador, according to a senior White House official.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/report-flynn-talked-with-russian-envoy-about-sanctions/">CBS News, Feb 10 2017:</a>
Investigators believe that Pres Trump’s national security adviser, Michael Flynn, privately discussed sanctions against Russia in a phone call with a Russian official, law enforcement sources told CBS News on Friday. Multiple sources told CBS News’ Jeff Pegues and Pat Milton that the conversation occurred before Mr Trump took office and, if true, could be a violation of protocol and could be viewed as a violation of the law.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think this issue is a perfect example of how a topic everyone could probably agree upon is being polarized.  I&#39;m not a fan of trump, but it&#39;s shocking the amount of people who don&#39;t think the Government was tapping Trump in some capacity.  I understand the fact that they are arguing Trump is wrong because it&#39;s not an old school wiretap, but to refuse to acknowledge he was probably monitored in some fashion in mind blowing.  The fact that they think the Government wasn&#39;t monitoring a presidential candidate seems ignorant to me, especially after all of the information we have learn over the last 3 decades.  </p>

The fucked up thing is, if you asked any of those people in that thread &quot;Do you think very phone call, text message, email or any other piece of electronic communication produced goes into the NSA.&quot; They would probably agree, but if you ask them about Trump tower, they will either act 1 of 3 ways.  Claim it never happened, make the point that Obama didn&#39;t give the order or that it wasn&#39;t a true &quot;Wiretap&quot; in the classical sense of a &quot;bug&quot;.

<p>I may be wrong about the total number.  I read hours of stuff a day for months and sometimes its hard to remember exactly where every detail comes from. </p>

<p>The bigger issue here is that they are collecting everything we do.  We also know from Snowden that they collect search and social media data: </p>

Do you want to live in a police state where the government just collects all our information under the guise of National Security and then goes through a court system with no oversight to use the information however they please?  </p>

<p>Surveillance is not the same as wiretapping, wiretapping someone is something SPECIFIC where a person is targeted for &#39;surveillance&#39;. It is also ILLEGAL for a President to do since Nixon tried that and Congress made laws against it.</p>

<p>Trump said that Obama wiretapped him, that&#39;s a giant lie no matter what the deflection is about &#39;both sides&#39;. If Trump wanted t be specific, he could have said that the Republican congress wiretapped him but then that doesn&#39;t go with the narrative. Let&#39;s not make excuses for every little lie that Trump spouts, encouraging him by giving him these little leeways is what makes him to do it more.</p>

<p>This is what I&#39;m talking about, it&#39;s the samething at this point.  Look like don&#39;t like Trump, I think he&#39;s a moron, a moron who used an old term, but the Government can listen into any of his conversation at anytime and I bet they did/have, whether it was illegal or not.  </p>

<p>Yes, feed into the polarization.  That&#39;s what this is all about imo.  It doesn&#39;t matter if it was Obama or not, they have had this capability for several decades and it&#39;s nothing new.  </p>

<p>And let&#39;s not act like the NSA can&#39;t use a smart house hold items to surveillance anyone.  I don&#39;t really care what Trump lied about, because it doesn&#39;t really matter, he lies all day long.

<p>Then there is nothing to debate, Trump lied blatantly and then his supporters pretended that he was talking about the NSA after the DOJ and FBI said no wiretapping happened. It&#39;s just gish-gallop, find an element of unrelated truth and pretend rest of the lie was a fact. </p>

<p>I agree he, lied blatantly, he does on a daily basis, I don&#39;t deny that, nor have I supported him... But that doesn&#39;t change the fact that I would agree with his supporters that the NSA was probably tapping his ass in all sorts of ways.

<p>Sure but again I want to point out that Trump wasn&#39;t claiming he was being surveilled by the NSA, he was accusing Obama of targeting him with an illegal wiretap. It&#39;s very important to keep this in mind to not let lies become normalized.</p>

<p>It&#39;s also important to recognized that at any point they can pull all of his surveillance if they like.  This story isn&#39;t normalizing Trump lying, even his supporters admit that, but it conditions people to think the Government doesn&#39;t surveil everyone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>True, it isn&#39;t but that&#39;s more semantics than anything practical. To me, the implication is that everything Trump did or said was logged, and if he actually did anything nefarious, Comey would have investigated him (which he admitted he didn&#39;t). So either Trump is a James Bond villain genius (which contradicts everything liberals have been saying about him) or he really didn&#39;t do anything all that nefarious with Russia, at least not any more than Hillary selling 20 percent of our uranium production to Russia after a massive Clinton Foundation donation.</p>

&quot;the episode underscores the special ethical challenges presented by the Clinton Foundation, headed by a former president who relied heavily on foreign cash to accumulate $250 million in assets even as his wife helped steer American foreign policy as secretary of state, presiding over decisions with the potential to benefit the foundation’s donors.&quot;</p>

<p>Not to mention your sitting president openly colluding with the Russia president. And it&#39;s can you read MY son, it&#39;s a reference to Trailer Park Boys you mustard tiger.</p>

<p>Oh please, if Clintons wanted to rake in money for favors, there are plenty of offshore accounts they can sue, why would they take in money into a charity with public audit?</p>

<p>You might want to look up what the word colluding means, if it was done openly then it wasn&#39;t colluding</p>

<p>The donation was by a Canadian from a Canadian company months before the take over and that guy has been donating prior to the deal. And it went to a publicly audited charity, which nobody can point out was used to funnel money to the Clintons even after asking multiple times for any proof.</p>

<p>I may be wrong about the total number.  I read hours of stuff a day for months and sometimes its hard to remember exactly where every detail comes from. </p>

<p>The bigger issue here is that they are collecting everything we do.  We also know from Snowden that they collect search and social media data: </p>

<p>200 mb connections are incredibly uncommon in the US and genuinely impossible over VPN.</p>

<p>Crowdstrike is in the pocket of Google and because of them are now worth over a billion (after the &quot;DNC hack&quot;, which had even less evidence than the Sony hack), who is influencing Clinton. They are clearly colluding, just like Bezos with the WaPo and Amazon.</p>

<p>&quot;Unlike the current and former intelligence eofficials anonymously quoted in stores about the Trump-Russia scandal, VIPS members actually have names&quot;</p>

<p>Where exactly did you get the idea VIPS was anonymous?</p>

<p>And Comey admitted that they only hired Crowdstrike after being denied access to the servers after multiple requests. </p>

<p>Why would they care if Republicans in the FBI saw their servers, Mueller is a Republican, if anything they should WANT them to see the servers to get rid of any doubt (if they weren&#39;t full of shit of course).  </p>
