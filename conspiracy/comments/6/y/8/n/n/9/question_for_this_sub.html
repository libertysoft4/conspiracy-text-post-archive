    <div class="md"><p>Well just recently fb had some AI that appeared to communicate with another AI in a way that a human wouldn&#39;t understand or decipher. That&#39;s just what they decided to report on. Who knows what they or anybody else hasn&#39;t reported. </p>

<p>AI could be a literal god before you or I die. Once we start letting a learning system flourish and expand how it sees fit who knows what could happen? That&#39;s why Musk and others want to make sure we have the proper rules set in place before we try to hatch a dragon. </p>

<p>Imagine what AI could do for traffic if we all had connected cars. It could potentially turn a logistical nightmare into a breezy ride home. Imagine if AI handled all the harvesting and processing on a farm to maybe bring higher yields at a lower cost. Imagine AI picking your kids up for school. It would change society but what would happen if it suddenly decided that serving primates wasn&#39;t the most constructive and beneficial way to spend its power? All this is just speculation but you get the idea. </p>

<p>You can&#39;t rule the crazy shit out so the best thing to do is prepare for it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My guess is that &#39;it&#39; will continue to brainwash the masses just as it is now. Only now the formula seems to have been effectively proven enough times in order for the &quot;handlers&quot; to kick it up a notch.  </p>

<p>IMHO most of this is done via media (Internet, TV, movies, gaming, etc.; ) and other invisible technology that we already know exists but will get you thrown into the looney bin if you openly discuss it. And now it seems via security breeches or voluntary sharing or just by combined efforts towards a common goal, the power is in the hands of many more than it was before. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Rare is the day when a billionaire who could potentially invest in and make bank in the field is actively promoting strict government regulation of that field, but such are the unknown hazards and unprecedented nature of AI development. Considering us going out of our way to create consciousnesses more intelligent and capable than our own is one thing-- couple this with automation, cybernetics, drones, how locked in everyone is to the increasingly-botted internet for basic information and social interaction, all the money up for grabs in all this. All part of an increasingly grim picture in which basic humanity and notions like empathy feel increasingly fossilized. Almost like science fiction writers have always been right, and we&#39;ve been right to fear their ideas.</p>

<p>It&#39;s called the posthuman condition. I advise us all to read up.</p>

But joking aside, I am not arguing one way or the other. I would love further confirmations of yours for the globe model. We can continue via pm if you wish. My main problems with the globe model concern what I perceive to be a very real fakery of space images which doesn&#39;t make sense given the number of satellites and cameras in orbit capable of taking full-disk images, the lack of demonstrable curvature whether on land or by plane (seeing stuff over-the-horizon), as well as thought experiments like the atmosphere rotating perfectly with the earth (and faster as you go higher up the air column).</p>

<p>Seems to me it is entirely possible to prove the Earth is round without relying on images from space at all.</p>
