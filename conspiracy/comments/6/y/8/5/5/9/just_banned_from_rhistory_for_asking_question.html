        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Here is my original post, &quot;Why do we ignore the international banking cartels (Rockefellers, Rothschilds) and the fact that they obviously fund both sides of almost every war? It seems like we always look to find the cause of tyranny and war, when in reality we&#39;ve been ignoring the real answer that sits right in our faces.
The most obvious piece of evidence is the sinking of the Lusitania. It was so blatantly an attempt to gain citizen support of sending troops to Europe. Before the Lusitania was sunk, virtually all Americans were opposed to joining the war. Afterwards millions volunteered.
<a href="http://www.threeworldwars.com/world-war-1/ww1.htm">http://www.threeworldwars.com/world-war-1/ww1.htm</a>&quot;</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t spread any rumors or agendas, I simply stated a fact followed by a question. I was banned within two minutes of posting this. Who knew the Rothschilds even controlled r/history?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, that is what they said in a message to which I replied, &quot;How exactly does my post violate rules 2 and 3? Rule two, in summary, prohibits posters from getting political and establishing any kind of &quot;agenda&quot; My post was about a piece of history, banks and banking families to be exact, not politics. Neither was piece trying to further any kind of agenda. I was simply trying wrap my head around the fact that there are events that unfolded in HISTORY, which have changed the world but are ignored entirely.
Rule three prohibits posters from posting about misunderstood or misrepresented history. Nothing is misunderstood on my part, I know the facts and I was inquiring the users of r/history to see if any could fathom why such historical facts would be taught no where. These facts are not taught in schools or universities anywhere. They have no representation at all. How can something be misrepresented if there is in fact no representation?&quot; </p>

<p>Still waiting on a response.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well your thesis was, basically, all wars are banker&#39;s wars but then you used the lusitania as proof of this, and pretty weakly. It&#39;s common knowledge the lusitania was used to garner support for the war, which you correctly pointed out, but you failed to link it at all to the bankers.</p>

<p>why not point out the American Industrialists supporting Hitler and then playing both sides as the conflict began in earnest? </p>

<p>Why not talk about the Crassus&#39; role in the first roman triumvirate? </p>

<p>Anyway, the fact that I even mentioned Rockefeller and Rothschild in a negative tone led to them banning me for &quot;anti-Semitic conspiracy theories&quot;.

    <div class="md"><p>Here is the wiki write-up on the origin and use of the Rothchild conspiracy theory.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Conspiracy theories
See also: <strong>List of conspiracy theories § Antisemitic conspiracy theories, and Antisemitic canard</strong> § Accusations of controlling the world financial system</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>These conspiracy theories about the Rothschild family are not based on evidence, but rather arise from anti-Semitic prejudice and various antisemitic canards.[84][85][86][87][88][89]</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s why they banned you. You are using buzzwords that have a history of anti-Semitic uses (whether you mean it that way or not) and have nearly no support among academic historians. That&#39;s an academic sub that has those rules precisely for your kind of post. That&#39;s not a personal affront, but just a description of who they are and how they roll. </p>

<p>The tone was also pretty combative.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why do we ignore the international banking cartels (Rockefellers, Rothschilds) and the fact that they obviously fund both sides of almost every war? It seems like we always look to find the cause of tyranny and war, when in reality we&#39;ve been ignoring the real answer that sits right in our faces. The most obvious piece of evidence is the sinking of the Lusitania. It was so blatantly an attempt to gain citizen support of sending troops to Europe. Before the Lusitania was sunk, virtually all Americans were opposed to joining the war. Afterwards millions volunteered. <a href="http://www.threeworldwars.com/world-war-1/ww1.htm">http://www.threeworldwars.com/world-war-1/ww1.htm</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>That suggests that historians were &quot;ignoring&quot; and missing an obvious answer &quot;right in our faces&quot;. In a sub designed for people that don&#39;t know the answer to ask academic historians (or enthusiasts) you came claiming to know and implying the academic subject they love is flawed and misleading. Seriously, what did you expect? Know your audience.</p>

<p>There have been wars that had to do with debts and money. And wars where tons of money was lost. You went into your question in 100% <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> mode and then asked a conspiracy subreddit why they didn&#39;t agree with you. Maybe because not everyone agrees with the theory you&#39;re pushing, and a lot of people who blame everythin on the Rothschilds come from some weird anti-Semitic position.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t posit your conclusion in your question.  Don&#39;t ask them to answer a non historical question.</p>

<p>Your question as framed is really &quot;Why do <em>we</em> ignore...&quot;  You are asking historians why they are ignoring something, not about it.  </p>

<p>Also you cite the Lusitiania but fail to link it to your thesis.  The Lusitania was propagandized, and we lied about her cargo and used it as an causus belli.  But none of those facts link it to banking cartels.     </p>

<p>Ethical historians approach history based on the documentary (which these days includes video, audio, etc, but used to be only books and letters) evidence.  Any conclusions drawn need to be directly supported.</p>

<p>If you want historians to answer your question you first have to ask what actual evidence exists.  Setting aside your question about why they are &quot;ignoring&quot; something, you need to restructure your question.</p>

<p>To get to the heart of your question, you seem to want a discussion of how international banking drives military conflict.  So you should structure your question something like this:</p>

<p>&quot;The wars of the 20th century were on an industrial scale never before seen in human history.  To what extent did commerce, international financial institutions and major industrial concerns drive the military build ups that contributed to the scale of the warfare in World War I and II?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There are numerous examples of groups profiting from and driving both sides of the major military conflicts of the last century.  For instance, <a href="http://greatwarproject.org/2015/07/20/a-clear-case-of-trading-with-the-enemy/">German and Allied forces traded military supplies with each other during the first World War, exchanging rubber for high-grade optics</a>.  And <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/nazis/readings/sinister.html">Switzerland profited during World War II acting as a middle-man for financial transactions with the Reich</a>.  Texaco essentially gave free oil to Franko during the Spanish Civil War, contributing to the fall of the Republican government.&quot;  </p>

<p>&quot;How widespread was the corporate abetting of military conflict in the last century and based on historical trends are corporations and financial concerns increasingly driving conflict today?&quot;   </p>
