<p>Have you considered the possibility that none of what we are told about Pat Tillman is true? I mean, if they would lie about even one element, why would you trust them on <em>any</em> part of the story?</p>

<p>The next logical step is to ask ourselves what we know about Tillman&#39;s death <em>apart</em> from what the media told us. The honest, unsettling answer? <strong>Nothing</strong>. We don&#39;t even know that he really died. Only the naive are unaware how often people fake their deaths: it can be done, and <em>easily</em>.</p>

<p>But this is not what people want. They want stories, even conspiratorial stories. They don&#39;t want to admit that, apart from the shadows on the wall, we know very little about not only Tillman but <em>all</em> the characters we only know through the media.</p>

<p>Imagine that level of <strong>power</strong>.</p>

<p>The other brick wall that I am all too familiar with is related to that small amount of knowledge that I do possess: I am not confident that that knowledge is what I think it is, and I&#39;m not sure if I acquired such information through personal life experience and formal/informal education and inherited genetics and human instinct, or.... if that content was chosen FOR me and assigned to be u/tangled_night_sleep&#39;s knowledge/memory bank. I haven&#39;t figured out a way to test these brick walls, but everyday I keep trying, I&#39;d like to tear them down a bit and see whats really going on there.</p>

<p>I agree, it is frustrating. I think this is precisely why so many people who are into alternative/conspiracy ideas latch onto patently absurd stories, because they prefer to believe something rather than nothing. Those of us with a more skeptical attitude must be honest with ourselves, and admit that we really don&#39;t know much about celebrities, the &#39;elite&#39;, or how their world operates.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The word logical to me means what the definition is. Being rational or reasonable.</p>

<p>So instead of Tilman actually getting whacked by our military you mention that maybe he didn&#39;t really die. The problem is there&#39;s no motive for the example you brought up.</p>

<p>Anything is possible but that doesn&#39;t mean I can&#39;t determine which theories seem the most rational out of all of them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From what I can tell regarding the Pat Tillman story it seems that</p>

<ul>
<li>Pat Tillman basically was either against the war or turned against it at some point</li>
<li>Fits the character of someone that would have problems with his unit (anti-war, atheist, intellectual)</li>
<li>His unit basically fragged him to shut him up and burned all his belongings and his journal to just get rid of as much information/evidence as possible</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, if we want to get into it deeper and if there was a higher level plot to do this, I can&#39;t speculate, it&#39;s certainly <em>possible</em> but who knows. </p>

<p>What we do know is that both the chain of command and government basically lied to mitigate the PR damage from this event of their poster boy solder potentially speaking out against the war and the immediate acknowledgment of him being killed by friendly fire.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think this is the bottom line:</p>

<p>&quot;Tillman had naively made contact with the CIA’s Noam Chomsky to discuss his plans to reveal what he knew about the lies of Bush, Cheney and Rumsfeld in the War on Terror. He was apparently also angry about the US Army’s support of the Afghan opium trade, started up by the army after the Taliban had eradicated it {nearly}one hundred percent during their four-year reign.&quot;</p>

<p>The fact that he confided in establishment gatekeeper/CIA lackey Noam Chomsky is significant.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just analysis by lots of people about him being a gatekeeper.<br/>
I think it&#39;s clear that he is.
From there it&#39;s pretty intuitive who he works for.</p>

<p>Here are just two examples of many--James Corbett and Barrie Zwicker.</p>

<p>James Corbett:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.corbettreport.com/episode-285-meet-noam-chomsky-academic-gatekeeper/">https://www.corbettreport.com/episode-285-meet-noam-chomsky-academic-gatekeeper/</a></p>

<p>But it&#39;s long.  So here’s my summary:</p>

<p>-The first 17 minutes he just talks about Chomsky&#39;s cred as a linguist, so you won&#39;t miss anything by forwarding to that point.
-After the 17 minute mark Corbett talks about classic lefty gatekeeper behavior in general.
-After that he evaluates Chomsky’s ill informed statements on JFK, 911, Federal Reserve.</p>

<p>-Around 47:32 Corbett calls Chomsky a gatekeeper.<br/>
He asks to what degree does Chomsky know what he’s talking about?<br/>
To what degree is he deliberately misleading people?
And to what degree is he misleading them in general?
He answers that we all have to answer those questions for ourselves.</p>

<p>-However, Corbett notes that Chomsky refuses to look into issues that would actually destabilize the political structure. </p>

<p>“He uses his verbosity and loquacity to talk around various subjects and to mumble and mutter and stutter on for 8 minutes 
in ways that completely fail to address the original question and in ways that no one seems to notice.”</p>

<p>It’s a key technique in his ability to deflect and avoid answering the question.  </p>

<p>“We can see Chomsky’s pronouncements for what they are.”</p>

<p>-Corbett concludes:</p>

<p>“While I can&#39;t know exactly what&#39;s in Chomsky&#39;s mind, I most certainly can make an informed and intelligent determination of the likely motives for his absolutely nonsensical statements about the crimes of 9-11. Chomsky is behaving like a classic &quot;gatekeeper&quot; of the &#39;left&#39;, like &quot;controlled opposition&quot;. All we&#39;re saying is: If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it&#39;s probably a duck!”</p>

<h2></h2>

<p>Barrie Zwicker:</p>

<p>&quot;A study of Chomsky&#39;s stands on particularly dreadful actions such as JFK&#39;s assassination, 9/11, and with regard to the roles of the CIA and FBI, shows Chomsky to be a de facto defender of the status quo&#39;s most egregious outrages and their covert agency engines. He conducts his de facto defence of the Empire he appears to oppose through applying the very propaganda methods against which he has warned, including use of the derogatory phrase &quot;conspiracy theorist,&quot; which in one context he has characterized as &quot;something people say when they don&#39;t want you to think about what&#39;s really going on.</p>

<p>His recommendation that people practice &quot;intellectual self-defence&quot; is well taken. But how many could dream the person warning you is one of the most perilous against whom you&#39;ll need to defend yourself? That he is the fire marshal who wires your house to burn down, the lifeguard who drowns you, the doctor with the disarming bedside manner who administers a fatal injection?</p>

<p>If Noam Chomsky did not exist, the diaboligarchy would have to invent him. To the New World Order he is worth 50 armoured division.&quot;
