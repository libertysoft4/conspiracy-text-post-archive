<p>Plastic is the tobacco of the 21st century. Problem is - you can stop smoking. You can&#39;t stop using plastic completely.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The first problem is a chemical group called phthlates. They’re used to make plastics soft and flexible, and as you might guess, they’re found in nearly all kinds of flexible plastics ranging from soda bottles to plastic bags. <strong>Phthlates are linked to delayed puberty, low testosterone, and feminine characteristics</strong> in various human and animal studies.</p>

<p>The second problem is a chemical called Bisphenol A or BPA. It’s also l<strong>inked to low testosterone, increased estrogen, delayed puberty, and feminine characteristics</strong> in various human and animal studies (also explained in more detail below).</p>

<p>The third problem is that a huge list of chemicals used in the manufacturing process of plastic products are labeled as xenoestrogens, meaning that <strong>they mimic the effects of exogenous estrogen (female hormone) in the body</strong>. This includes the phthlates and BPA that I mentioned above, and also: PCBs, Bisphenol S (BPS), dioxin, vinyl chloride, styrene, phenolix, epoxy resin, PMMA, PTFE, and many many others…</p>

<p><strong>These are in your bottles, in your tubes of toothpaste, in your cheese packaging, in your food containers, in your plastic cups, cutlery and bags.</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/1408163/">This Swedish study</a> had 196 boys as subjects. The researchers measured phthlate levels from their mothers when they were still pregnant, and once the kids were 21 months old, their “anogenital distance” – which is a pretty solid fysical measurement of testosterone – was measured, to see if the phthlates had effect on the hormonal health of these 196 subject boys. <strong>The results were clear, the more phthlates the mother had in her system during pregnancy, the shorter the anogenital distance in the baby (the shorter the distance the lower the testosterone).</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/09/bpa-testosterone-bisphenol-a-_n_3246042.html">This study</a> compared the men who worked at a chemical plant which manufactures BPA, to men who worked at a tap water factory. <strong>The results show that the men who worked in contact with BPA had significantly lower serum testosterone levels, and especially free testosterone levels,</strong> when compared to the tap water factory fellows.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960076010003572">this study</a>, the researches analyzed 18 different samples of bottled water. <strong>Eleven of the samples showed significant estrogenic response.</strong></p>

<h1>But does this affect your everyday plastic use?</h1>

<p>In <a href="http://content.usatoday.com/communities/greenhouse/post/2011/03/bpa-free-plastic-products-estrogen/1#.VFqiPvmsXw8">this study</a>, the researchers tested 445 common plastic products to see if there was any estrogenic activity in them. <strong>70% of the products induced significant estrogenic activity, and the number jumped to 95% when the products were altered to “real life” conditions</strong>, such as the microwave heat and putting them to dishwasher. Also note that many of the products in this study were labeled as BPA-free, yet they still induced estrogenic effects similar to BPA plastics.</p>

<p><strong>Why isn&#39;t any government actively fighting this?</strong> Why would they?</p>

<h1>Oh, and if that wasn&#39;t enough:</h1>

    <div class="md"><p>Dupont is it&#39;s own special kind of evil, but the original patent war for polyolefins was fought, and won, by Dow (vs ExxonMobil). I&#39;m reluctant to admit this, but I used to work directly for the men involved in this war. I left the company after multiple heated debates regarding the weaponization of a patent I helped develop (amongst many other issues I had with them). Feel free to AMA, but I&#39;m not naming names. I don&#39;t have insider info that could land people in prison, but I know the Dow/chem industry culture and how they think. They&#39;re ruthless and give zero fucks about humanity.</p>

I knee plastic was ubiquitous in modern life, but this was eye opening as to extent of plastic use.

<p>One thing to note is that research has shown that overexposure to pornography is making straight men more aroused when they think about / see penises, that&#39;s pretty crazy.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t have a link as I&#39;m at work and I don&#39;t want to set off the alarm bells by using those search terms, but that might play a part. </p>

<p>Sexual dimorphism is essential for successful sexual relationships, especially long-term i.e. intergenerational. This dimorphism is being eliminated i the western world, with girls being told to act like boys, and vice versa. </p>

<p>This is all part of the <a href="https://www.johnlebon.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/epsilon-agenda-thumb-revised-1-800x445.jpg">agenda</a> laid out by Huxley et al decades and decades ago. They even told us what they were doing in a book which many people today claim to have read!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure their plans are &#39;speeding up&#39; so much as it just <em>seems</em> that way to those of us who have begun taking notice of what is happening. Insofar as it is &#39;speeding up&#39;, note that &#39;critical theory&#39; (i.e. cultural marxism i.e. Talmudism) has been spread throughout western universities for decades, but only in the past decade or so have people with regular undergrad degrees been taught it as a matter of routine. Those who then go on to teach at high school are now passing this psychological poison on to their high school students, and we are seeing the fruits of that.</p>

<p>Ask yourself this: how long did it take miscegeneation to from illegal, to virtuous? A man who now says he will only date his own race is labeled &#39;racist&#39;. How long do you think it will be before &#39;cisgendered&#39; people are labeled homophobic if they refuse to date their own sex?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are a ton of videos on this subject on YouTube. Essentially a lot of it has to do with breaking up and destroying the family unit so to speak. It&#39;s apparently part of &quot;their agenda&quot; which deals with turning society into a giant cesspool. I guess this allows for an easier to manage/control, dumbed-down population which will be more obedient towards global governance. This isn&#39;t my theory, I&#39;m just paraphrasing various YouTube videos I&#39;ve seen in the past. It&#39;s the same thing with the entire transgender movement and how not it&#39;s just about everywhere you look. What at one time was something incredibly strange and bizarre has now become normalized and perhaps even &quot;cool&quot; to naive/confused youth. These are just very strange times we are living in and I don&#39;t see things getting better anytime soon. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I suppose it is a matter of perspective. The nuclear family is one that can easily be distracted by cliché dreams of a white picked fence in the suburbs. Focusing on raising their children, working, various entertainment and vacations. Perhaps on the weekend they go to Home Depot for various projects around the house. I&#39;m that sense that would be compliant. However, people that have achieved this kind of stability have a vested interest in keeping this lifestyle. If you take this model and extrapolate it into more rural areas you often find militias, etc. These are the kind of people that will hold resistance to future globalist plans. So it really works both ways. </p>

<p>Ideally citizens obey the law, get jobs, consume and if their income supports it, takes out a mortgage and pays that sweet interest to the bank, all while having something that takes up their time and attention from politics and governance and imbues them with a sense of commitment and something to lose so they&#39;re less inclined to monitor their government, make are fuss and are more likely to be unwilling to go out on a limb in response to developments that curtail their rights.</p>

<p>Marrying and having children is associated with lower levels of criminality, higher levels of steady employment and lower levels of long term unemployment, entails a high level of consumption, is correlated with a higher rate of home buying and kids take up time and energy and are a significant emotional and psychological investment/distraction and imbue their parents with a sense of responsibility.  Getting those kids fed is more important than taking part in political activity that might risk your job or land you in prison.</p>

People in countries with uncontaminated tapwater and who use plastics less frequently can be compared against people who use plastics and who live in countries with contaminated tapwater.

    <div class="md"><p>I always followed the belief that men are becoming more androgynous in appearance now because of women. Men &quot;Peacock&quot; to find a Woman, and I heard (as in I haven&#39;t actually researched it myself, heard it on the Joe Rogan Podcast actually) that it&#39;s been proven that hormonal birth control used by women makes women prefer a more feminine looking man. So men make themselves look more feminine to attract women (by playing the percentages). </p>

<p>Now obviously this isn&#39;t a conscious decision, but if all the girly men around you are getting laid more than you, you&#39;re probably gonna try looking more feminine. </p>

<p>As to trans and homosexuality, I don&#39;t know, but I thought I&#39;d add this thought line to add to the discussion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>On the other hand, people are hitting puberty earlier than ever. I&#39;m unsure about trans people, but homosexuality in men is linked to estrogen in the womb, although bisexuality in men is linked to testosterone. Essentially, there&#39;s definitely not a one to one correlation between hormones and sexual orientation, but it can contribute to this, so it&#39;s reasonable to think that hormones could also play a role in trans people.</p>

    <div class="md"><h1>What you can do:</h1>

<ul>
<li><strong>Do not ever, ever, ever microwave anything containing plastic.</strong></li>
<li>Switch to glass containers and glass bottles.</li>
<li>Do not put any warm / hot fluids or foods in plastic containers, bags or bottles.</li>
<li>Don&#39;t buy plastic water bottles, but drink tap water and pour it into glass bottles. <em>Yes, even water probably has estrogen in it due to it not being filtered out well, but do you really want a double dose?</em></li>
<li>Buy whole foods (like Amazon did ;)). Not only is this about a billion times healthier, cooking is fun, easy (with slow cookers), but it also saves money. Buying some veggies, throwing &#39;em into a rice cooker, going to work and coming back to a very healthy meal is great and quick.</li>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah that&#39;s true, but they do take very long relative to a microwave. And a microwave does tend to give food a wet, floppy texture. So you win some and lose some. But in today&#39;s society everyone is all about instant gratification, so it&#39;ll be hard to convince everyone to give up their microwaves.<br/>
In what sense do you mean oven/stove reheats better? Like texture or flavour, or what&#39;s in it?

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly what you said, the microwave produces a floppy wet food abomination. When using oven/stove, you can add just a little milk or water or butter and make the food taste like it was just freshly made(with limitations, of course). If I&#39;m reheating fried chicken, and I don&#39;t want it to be soggy, I just pan fry it again in a little butter and it gives all the crispy crunch that a microwave would prefer you forget about entirely. :)   </p>

<p>As of September 2016, a total of 57 studies have investigated the relationship between fluoride and human intelligence, and over 40 studies have investigated the relationship fluoride and learning/memory in animals. Of these investigations, 50 of the 57 human studies have found that elevated fluoride exposure is associated with reduced IQ, while 45 animal studies have found that fluoride exposure impairs the learning and/or memory capacity of animals. The human studies, which are based on IQ examinations of over 12,000 children, provide compelling evidence that fluoride exposure during the early years of life can damage a child’s developing brain.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To add to this:</p>

<p>-Use a stainless steel french press for coffee. </p>

<p>-Lifefactory makes great glass water bottles and baby bottles (that become sippy cups with a BPA free lid)</p>

<p>-Berkey water filters are great for getting all the nasty crap out of your drinking water (including fluoride) and since it&#39;s gravity fed is great for your water needs in case of an emergency.</p>

<p>-Avoid the plastic toys for babies and children. This one is driving me nuts because relatives keep buying my baby plastic garbage and I don&#39;t want to hurt their feelings but I don&#39;t want my kid gnawing on plastic. Under the Nile, PlanToys, and Smiling Tree Toys (etsy shop), are a fee places where you can get plastic free non-toxic toys and clothes for kids. </p>

<p>-Use silicone/stainless steel plates and kid sized silverware for little ones. Not good to have heated up plastics in the mouth all the time. </p>

<p>-Avoid canned goods unless they are explicitly BPA free especially tomato products as the acidity can leech the bpa into the food easier (buy tomato products in glass jars- Jovial and Bionaturae brands are great and organic too).</p>

<p>-Avoid polyester clothing as they are made from old water bottles. That fleece material is polyester so beware of that stuff. I had to toss a lot of gifted baby clothes because I didn&#39;t want my kid wearing that. Keep in mind when getting new carpet too.</p>

<p>While it&#39;s near impossible to avoid all plastic all the time, it&#39;s good to start with getting it out of your food prep and clothes first. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There isn&#39;t much you can do to change regulations. People have been working on that for decades with very little progress. However, what you could do is implement common sense behaviors to reduce the amount of toxins you consume. You also could spread information and educate your fellow Americans about these problems. Eliminating toxin exposure is impossible, but there are a lot of easy things you could do to reduce it. Using glass containers and filter your water using reverse osmosis or distillation are two examples. </p>

<p>These chemicals in plastic are only one toxicological issue we face today. There are over 80,000 industrial chemicals used in the United States, many of which are directly added to rivers and lakes by manufacturing facilities. They dump these chemicals at illegal levels, but rarely face fines. Water treatment plants cannot remove everything from water, which they obtain from those polluted lakes and rivers, and we only test for about 100 contaminants out of those 80,000. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know it&#39;s not for everyone, but if you haven&#39;t tried ecigs I&#39;d highly recommend making the switch...or at least giving it a try. I&#39;m not talking about blu, or those gas station disposable ones, but instead something like an ego pen or a box mod. I quit cold turkey with mine, and I know a few others who have done the same. Start with whatever nicotine and flavor that does the trick for you, then over time try to decrease nic strength. If you have any questions feel free to pm me...otherwise if ecigs aren&#39;t your thing, then ignore me and best of luck getting off the death sticks :) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I started using a patch and have a Cupti with 14MG nicotine for emergencies (after I eat I have to smoke <em>something</em>) and I quit cold turkey about 3 weeks ago.</p>

<p>It turns out it was harder to quit when I didn&#39;t have any cigarettes on me. I went to 7-11, bought a pack, and haven&#39;t smoked a single one since I opened it.</p>

<p>But yes, vapes are lame (yeah I said it) but a legitimate way to help quit smoking. I feel so much better after I quit. Everything smells better and tastes better.</p>

<p>Grats on quitting as well!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cost totally depends on your set up, how much juice you go through, what kind of tank you&#39;re using etc. You could get a device that lasts you for days or weeks before refilling/changing coils, and you could have one that goes through juice and coils in a day or two. A lot of people start with ego pens and eventually move to a box mod, but it&#39;s all up to you. Then you decide what type of tank you want - RDA, RTA etc. I&#39;d recommend checking out ecig.com for affordable devices, such as starter kits, and when I&#39;m done rambling here I&#39;ll link a few subreddits that you could look into. </p>

<p>People in the ecig community are generally very nice and helpful getting people started with a set up and off of cigs. Doesn&#39;t hurt to make a post and see what you&#39;re options are...or like I said, pm me and id be happy to help :) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I convinced a friend to try ecigs when he said they&#39;re expensive, and I added up what he spends on cigarettes and proved that he would basically only have to I spend 2 weeks of cigarette money on a top of the range one. </p>

<p>He now is one of &quot;those guys&quot;, makes his own coils, uses a drip tip, talks about the voltage and wattage and throat hit and such. Even though all that shit annoys the fuck out of me, it&#39;s better than knowing he&#39;s killing himself slowly every day, and he has more disposable income, which he spends on more mods, which makes him happy, so win-win. </p>

<p>Also can I suggest you look into making your own juice? If you can make a cake you can make your own juice. It&#39;s as simple as following a recipe. You just download an app (I use one called Liquix in the Play Store) and tell it what you have and what you want, and it tells you how much to put in. 4 basic ingredients, PG VG Nicotine and flavour. You tell the app what ratio of PG to VG (start 50/50 and work it out from there), what percentage nicotine and what percentage flavour (I go with 15% but depends on flavour). </p>

<p>Now I have 3 of the ingredients in a cupboard and buy a bottle of flavour concentrate once a month. 30ml costs me £10 and makes me 200ml of liquid which lasts both myself and my SO the month, so £1.25 each a week. Better than the £10 a day on cigarettes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Then put a qualifier up so people can help fill in blanks.</p>

<p>You&#39;re partially right, hemp is very very useful for oils, medicene, building, ropes, fibers, clothing, certain oils can be fuel in the right engine, and some plastics. What you&#39;re talking about with Ford was probably not entirely of hemp resin but hemp was substituted when possible, it is a good filler for things. It is used in cars today with a fiberglass (plastic) base and hemp filler.</p>

<p>Like engine oil for example, there&#39;s a lot of thickening fluids used and hemp would be a fantastic substitute! But not all plastics are replaceable with hemp by any means.</p>

<p>That&#39;s a goddamned lie, dream bigger than the shit they tell you is the upper limit. Singular men change the entire world all the time. All it takes is the willingness to seize opportunity, like accepting a dare to run for president, or spending 40 minutes making a post about how shitty plastic is for humans to consume. It really is honestly that easy, you&#39;ve just got to be willing to do it every single time the opportunity comes along, because you never know where it&#39;ll leave you at the end of it.</p>

But maybe that isnt killing us fast enough, so they are also making everyone gay. I mean why not, weather manipulation is a thing. Fb constantly doing social research, they have admitted it openely many times. A whole city water network is fucked and probably has been for some time, covered up because of lead poisoning. Back in the prehistiruc times, they simply cullednthe population, after all hiw many bankers have cancer? Oil magninetes, big pharma, all the rich people, they dont have cancer (ones that matter) roschilds. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This was a part of life that was known to older generations, plastic is evil. My father &gt;60 told me that his grandmother refused to use anything plastic and that the vast majority of household items (especially food) always came in glass. I&#39;ve always wondered if the rise in plastics has caused a rise in cancer rates, lower life standards, additional auto immune diseases etc. Glad I&#39;m not the only one who has thought to question this trend.  </p>

<p>I know other countries still use glass for drinks mostly, and have robust recycling programs that work. If someone could replicate that in the American market and make a solid profit, then we would actually have a conversation among the masses for change.

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Why isn&#39;t any government actively fighting this? Why would they?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Time to mesh the two different threads of &quot;reality&quot; that I see out there to illustrate the real insanity of the current environment...</p>

<p><a href="/r/psychology">/r/psychology</a> <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/psychology/comments/6ym2ok/how_shortterm_increases_in_testosterone_change/">posted</a> a n article how testosterone &quot;shifts the way men think, encouraging them to rely on quick, intuitive, and generally less accurate, judgements&quot; which made a claim:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Male testosterone levels gradually fall with age, and some older men use testosterone ‘replacement’ gels, often at the dose used in this study, or inject the hormone. “Western society has been experiencing an exogenous testosterone ‘shock’ over the past decade from a rapidly growing testosterone-replacement-therapy industry,” the researchers write, in a final note. “The possibility that this widely prescribed treatment has unknown deleterious influences on specific aspects of decision making should be investigated further and taken into account by users, physicians and policymakers.”</p>

<p>More work is now needed to explore the effects of testosterone supplements in older men (whose levels are lower to start with), as well as to better understand how testosterone levels fluctuate naturally in day to day life – and so the likely effects on cognition.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This claim is evidently that we&#39;re experiencing a &quot;testosterone shock&quot; due to an environmental <em>excess</em>.</p>

<p>However, as you correctly demonstrate, there is <em>huge evidence</em> for antagonists (like BPA and phytoestrogens) significantly <em>reducing</em> the overall available testosterone.  (Which is probably why the supplements are needed)  And this antagonist effect outweighs any contribution that the &quot;extra&quot; testosterone contributes to the environment.</p>

<p>Somehow, I suspect there is some form of disinformation that causes these psychologists to believe that testosterone is actually the &quot;problem&quot; and it is what needs to be reduced.  Flying in the face of the reality that testosterone is at very low and decreasing levels along with reproductive viability for males in general.</p>

<p>The fact is that both scenarios being true is literally impossible.  Either there is too little or too much testosterone in the environment.  It seems strongly evident that someone has been misrepresenting the truth.  My question, however, is &quot;why?&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Phenomenal post and great commentary throughout. All of the reasons they are covering us and the planet in plastics are valid (destroying nuclear family, population reduction, etc). I personally believe it&#39;s a combination of a desire to destroy the environment and to make us more dependent. How many Americans today can procure their own food?  How many can cultivate a garden, practice animal husbandry for a sustainable meat source, or hunt for that meat?  We as a species receive our sustenance primarily from our corporations and our government presented in plastic containers. We are like gerbils lining up to the food dispenser as it&#39;s filled by them. I grew up on a farm 40 years ago. At that time we were fairly self sufficient. Growing wheat, corn, and edible beans (black, navy, pinto). We had chickens, pigs, and cattle for feeding grain not marketable but also for our own and neighbors consumption. In the small town we lived near there was a mill, a butcher...pretty much everything we needed to be a self sustaining micro-economy. Today my brother runs the farm. He raises corn, soybeans, and some wheat. There is no livestock. The mill, the butcher, all of them have long been put out of business. Everything produced is trucked to major cities where it is processed, packaged, and sent somewhere else before eventually making it back. This small town is no more self sufficient than anywhere else. In another generation most of the knowledge handed down through generations on being self sufficient will be completely lost even by those that are closest to the Earth. The plan IMO, is to clinically separate us from anything natural. Make us all completely dependent on them for every facet of our life. They have succeeded. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is great reporting. But it&#39;s still not a conspiracy - it&#39;s a business model.</p>

<p>The only conspiracy might be if the plastic companies colluded to disguise the extent of the danger of plastics and plastic waste in the environment.</p>

<p>The very fact that substantial evidence of the dangers have been public knowledge for a long time tells me that this isn&#39;t a real conspiracy. It&#39;s a market and sociology problem. People consume plastic because its convenient and cheap. The market demands it. </p>

<p>Education and government imposed regulations (for instance, taxing the hell out of plastics) would solve the problem irrespective of any conspiracy to disguise the problem.</p>

<p>There is no escape.  We need more hemp.  But what&#39;s stopping any company from loading that up with chemicals too?</p>

<p>I do recall a documentary on Netflix about this topic.  Of course at this time I cannot think of the name.  So sorry, saw it about a year ago, please forgive me.  But towards the end it focused on a couple, probably in their 60&#39;s who were doing excellent at avoiding these chemicals.  They would wash and air out for a time their clothing, so that they wouldn&#39;t be absorbing the chemicals into their skin.  These people, before they made the lifestyle switch, had become very ill recurrently from these chemicals.  I don&#39;t know what made them more sensitive than the rest of the majority (or, people just aren&#39;t making that connection, who knows), but once they realized it was the chemicals and they changed their lifestyle, the illnesses stopped.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A few years ago, when we started to hear about BPA, I heard a story on NPR. A scientist/college prof who had helped develop thermal paper for cash register receipts was hearing about this and thought - hey we used BPA in the thermal paper we developed years ago, I wonder if they are still using that. So he sent a bunch of his students out to various stores to collect register receipts. Most of them tested positive for BPA. </p>

<p>I also learned, that unlike many other toxins, BPA is not measured in PPM (parts per million), but in Parts per TRILLION - very tiny amounts are toxic. And that level is hard to test for.</p>

<p>It also took a long time for bottled water companies to come around to this issue. The normal 5-gal bottles have BPA in them, and still widely used. Most of the BPA-free bottles are just another type of plastic. Glass 5-gal bottles are still around, but expensive.</p>

<p>This study you linked to in which you describe the estrogenic response as &quot;significant&quot; shows estrogenic compounds in the tens of picograms. A picogram is one trillionth of a gram, and these concentrations are hardly significant. I cant think of any compound on earth that has any measureable effect in the picogram concentration. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for posting this!  Zetatalk also confirms that PCBs are the hidden culprit behind the infertility crisis rocking the developed Western world.  Here in Canada, our government is using this fertility crisis as an excuse to import millions of Chinese and Indians as immigrants.  They are telling us that we are not having enough children, so we must import people from the Third World.  This makes me sick, and livid!!</p>
