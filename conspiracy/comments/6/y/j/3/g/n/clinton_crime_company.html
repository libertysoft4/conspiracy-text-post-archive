        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The Clintons are one of the most evil families in the United States and they are working with the British Crown, German noble families, and the Vatican. Hillary Clinton is the head of the Clinton crime family and she is ruthless and murderous. Both Hillary Clinton and Bill Clinton were educated at Yale University which is a college established by the British Crown. Bill Clinton was also Jesuit educated from Georgetown University. Hillary Rodham Clinton has English and Scottish ancestry. The Rodham family take their name from Rodheim Germany a small town in Hesse under the authority of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Mainz and later under the authority of the Eppstein noble family. Jeffrey Epstein is a wealthy financier and pedophile that was convicted of soliciting an underage girl for prostitution. Jeffrey Epstein is friends with Bill Clinton who he flew to Africa in his private jet. It has been reported that Bill Clinton has flown on Jeffrey Epstein&#39;s jet numerous times. Chelsea Clinton is on the board of directors for InterActiveCorp which is a internet media company with the billionaire Barry Diller as the Chairman. Barry Diller was married to Princess Diane von Furstenberg and her son Prince Alexander von Furstenberg is also on the board of directors of IAC with Chelsea Clinton. The Furstenberg family are a Roman Catholic German nobility closely connected with the Vatican. The Clintons have many suspicious and untimely deaths surrounding them and some estimate they have ordered the assassination of dozens. Some suspicious deaths are of James McDougal, Vince Foster, Ron Brown, and Kathy Ferguson as well as many more. The Clinton&#39;s have connections to the Vatican through Bill Clinton&#39;s education at Georgetown and also ties to Chicago where Hillary Clinton was originally from. I believe that many of the hits the Clinton family ordered were carried out by the Chicago Outfit. On top of their body list Bill Clinton authorized the US involvement in NATO&#39;s bombing of Yugoslavia which killed at least hundreds of civilians and displaced many more. The Clinton crime family are a highly destructive force on America and the world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Odin is the father god in Norse Mythology. The Vikings were a Scytho-Sarmatian tribe that originated from Northern India as the Valhikas and migrated up into Persia mixing in with the very different Urartian tribes and I believe they were called the Aorsi and later the Alanorsi creating the term Norse. The Urartians were like chameleons and blend into cultures and corrupt them. Valhalla is a literal place in the Himalayas which historians are covering up. Valhalla is an Indian word. The Alanorsi eventually mixed in with the Scandinavian tribes which were ancient Greco-Scythians often called Germanic. Runes were like engraved scriptures using symbols and used as a form of communications for those who could read them. </p>

<p>so the Urartians was an offshoot to the mystery Babylon/the Old Man of the Mountain?</p>

<p>this is where i am stuck atm, i believe Odin was a priest of the mystery schools. but i cant find anything on him really.</p>
