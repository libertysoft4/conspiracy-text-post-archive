    <div class="md"><p>You are fairly obvious with your ban baiting here, but I am going to help you out a bit by getting you started on your way to understanding astroturfing in social media.</p>

<p>There is plenty of evidence out there about astroturfing organizations. I have compiled a few links. There are a varied number of political groups, corporate entities and nation states conducting propaganda operations in social media, with the USA having the largest number of registered astroturfing organizations.</p>

<p>There is a lot of info on the astroturfing organizations Correct the Record, ShareBlue and Media Matters. Their official mission statements that are publicly available state their intent to use propaganda for the DNC on the web and on social media such as Reddit, Facebook and Twitter. This implies the use of social community opinion management software and other tools. </p>

<p>From the post:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So we know how popular Sanders and his positions are, yet politics is showing numbers that should not exist considering the raw data we&#39;re looking at. His ideals should still be the super majority it was prior to the DNC convention, yet it&#39;s not, not by a longshot. Single payer is getting shut down as well, an issue that only the staunchest of neoliberals would be against, yet it seems to be the prevailing view in politics. </p>

<p>From this Oxford research paper on astroturfing:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There is no doubt that individual social media users can spread hate speech, troll other users, or set up automated political communication campaigns. Unfortunately, this is also an organized phenomenon, with major governments and political parties dedicating significant resources towards the use of social media for public opinion manipulation.</p>

<p>... In many countries, political actors have no reported ability to field social media campaigns. In some countries, one or two known political actors occasionally use social media for political messaging, and in a few other countries there are multiple government agencies, political parties, or civil society groups organizing trolling and fake news campaigns.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He had the &quot;<em>mini</em> meltdown&quot; in the comment. As you can read by his words he wrote. Yeah it&#39;s interesting that account has never commented here before, but I don&#39;t disagree with him. If you make a shit joke and get downvoted for it don&#39;t blame brigaders, shills and bots. They do exist, but so do people.<br/>
What is curious though is how that account has slightly changed their posting habits recently and supposedly they&#39;ve been posting comments every hour for the last 20 hours... That might be worth keeping tabs on... BUT in this particular instance I think OP is overacting. </p>

<p>That&#39;s a bit of a mini meltdown. I think most people here would agree that there are shills and bots on reddit, but OP provides no new evidence that that is the case. Instead he has shown that he easily loses his cool. That&#39;s why people are skeptic towards OP.</p>

<p>If you want to talk about shills and bots on reddit I suggest you write a post on the subject with some material to back it up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, the subject is very fascinating. I&#39;d like to see an extensive post about shills and bot. I&#39;d love to read it if it contained some new material or if it was a compilation of older evidence and material in one single post. If that was the case we would have something to talk about. There would be something to base the discussion on.</p>

<p>Right now all OP is saying is &quot;There are bots and shills on reddit and I&#39;m being downvoted for my unpopular opinions&quot;. The commenters here have agreed that bots and shills are indeed a problem, but suggested that OP might have been downvoted because of his arrogance and wild temperament. There is nothing else to discuss since OP haven&#39;t provided anymore information.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything else to miss. I agree that there bots and shills on reddit. Do you have any interesting informaion on the subject that you would like to share?</p>

<p>Did you downvote me by the way? I find that a bit ironic and rude since you&#39;ve expressed concern of being unfairly downvoted yourself. I think I&#39;ve been polite.</p>

<p>You people are the ones with the holier than thou attitude.</p>

<p>Acting as if you have never gotten frustrated on reddit and made a stupid edit or two.</p>

<p>Or maybe you have never been gangdownvoted before by the reddit hordes. Not something to be proud of, it just means you are a sheep who always goes with the grain in every subject.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Everyone makes mistakes, everyone gets frustrated, and everyone has been massively downvoted on at least one occassion. not everyone refuses to accept when they are wrong, and proceeds to accuse everyone else of being simultaneously arrogant, delusional idiots, bots, and shills for not liking their comment.</p>

<p>If I get pissed at someone and make a comment insulting them then that&#39;s on me, and if I get downvoted for it I might be mad as well, but I&#39;m not going to insinuate that they are only downvoting me because they are bots, shills, or idiots who just don&#39;t get what I am saying. acting like that just shows a complete lack of self awareness.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s exactly what I said.<br/>
He&#39;s a threat to the status quo because in his incompetence he reveals the corruption of the entire system. The last thing the elite want us for the people to understand the nature of their oppression. Trump makes it easy for us to unite against the system.</p>

<p>Oh yeah, a republican candidate running for president as a member of the republican party, who&#39;s campaign was largely based on both espousing republican views and complaining about his democrat opponent, really &#39;shakes up&#39; the two party system.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>... I don&#39;t think you understand what I mean. But that&#39;s ok. I&#39;m just saying Trump invites dissent, and that we have an opportunity to unite against him and the system he represents.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>same shit happens here, just on a different level.</p>

<p>try talking about gyroscopes, and how they don&#39;t move.</p>

<p>consider a gyroscope, which maintains its position in space irrespective of outside movement.</p>

<p>then a gyroscope should move because the earth is moving, both spinning and moving in space.  yet it doesn&#39;t.  it remains stationary.</p>

<p>schills attacked me at once with aviation gyroscopes, which they claim have to adjust for the curve of the earth.  i say that is a blackbox that i can&#39;t investigate, and irrelevant to a stationary gyroscope on the ground, it should spin, if the earth were spinning, but is apparently not.</p>
