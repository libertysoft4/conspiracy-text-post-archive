        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Look at the comment section in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6xyjmv/illuminati_member_tells_all_about_pizzagate_mk/">this OP</a> that <a href="/u/LightBringerFlex">/u/LightBringerFlex</a> posted.  I&#39;m just...beside myself with the amount of vehement &quot;she&#39;s lying and only trying to sell a book&quot; comments In there.  It&#39;s like...seriously?  I understand that not everyone who claims they got raped actually got raped, and I understand that there are enough charlatans in this world at this point for people to be skeptical about certain claims, but, again, the vehemence of some of the comments immediately vilifying the speaker seem entirely imbalanced and very uncritical.</p>

<p>Kind of reeks of either intense shilldom or no-less-intense useful idiots.</p>

<p>EDIT:  This one user in particular (who I won&#39;t even bother naming, but who one can guess who it is by simply reading the trolling comments in this thread) is trolling and stalking and PMing constantly right now attempting to...to...hell, I don&#39;t know <em>what</em> they&#39;re trying to do...I guess bully?</p>

<p>It&#39;s pretty stupid on their part, but it&#39;s at least indicative of the very thing I&#39;m talking about in the OP.</p>

<p>Very weird and disturbing that people are actually like this and defend this kind of activity.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT 2</strong>:  Holy shit.  I just got banned from this sub! lol.  It states it&#39;s for &quot;repeated shill accusations&quot;, but I wonder if HALF the users in this thread have therefore been banned because <em>everybody&#39;s</em> been calling everybody a shill.</p>

<p>Uh...WTF is going on?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It can and <em>has</em> been proven already.  What is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_child_prostitution_ring_allegations">this</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtstlx96s8M">this?</a>  And that&#39;s just one example.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not that it can&#39;t be proven.  It&#39;s that after it gets proven, not only do the plebs simply keep their heads in the sand and don&#39;t want to see what&#39;s real, but the proof that&#39;s there is ultimately protected by an extremely powerful cadre of extremely evil beings - human and/or non-human.</p>

<p>I upvoted you, btw, so I&#39;m not fighting w/you here...but yeah.  This shit&#39;s been proven.  It&#39;s happening and it&#39;s epidemic.  Systematic pedophilia is very, very real, unfortunately.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s all of your posts in the last day:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6y0cp6/remember_when_investment_guru_hillary_clinton/dmkp4au/">I just came to respond with how spot on this was only to find you&#39;ve already got a downvote. This sub is being fucking hijacked.</a></p>

<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6y0cp6/remember_when_investment_guru_hillary_clinton/dmkddew/">Which is why I find it so odd that it&#39;s nearly impossible to have a contained conversation about one of them without people crying about why we aren&#39;t talking about the other. It&#39;s always the same people too.
-Hillary Post
&quot;I wonder what TD users are trying to hide now&quot;
-Trump Post
&quot;Haha, time&#39;s running up losers! I wonder what sorts of Hillary and Pizzagate posts will be spammed to bury this thread&quot;
They don&#39;t want civil discourse, regardless of the topic.</a></p>

<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6y0cp6/remember_when_investment_guru_hillary_clinton/dmkd8xn/">It actually is whataboutism, it&#39;s always used to deflect to Trump whenever Hillary is mentioned.</a></p>

<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6y0cp6/remember_when_investment_guru_hillary_clinton/dmkd73a/">Oh no, a Hillary post.
I&#39;m now blind to all other topics in the sub, why have you done this to me? I want to complain more about Trump but now that this post exists I cannot keep my eyes away from it!
I&#39;ve now completely forgotten the 5+ top posts on the sub that discussed Trump&#39;s horrible pardon decision, thanks guys.</a></p>

<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6y0cp6/remember_when_investment_guru_hillary_clinton/dmkd59v/">Did you assume that these totally organic users that piggyback off eachother&#39;s quick jabs at the subreddit whenever a Hillary thread is posted are here to do anything else?</a></p>

<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6xwq0r/clinton_email_what_i_did_do_was_have_a_personal/dmk6j49/">A bunch of users who regularly comment together dissenting anything that has to do with Hillary has come to let us know that it wasn&#39;t actually Hillary who sent the email.
Nothing to see here</a></p>

<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6xwq0r/clinton_email_what_i_did_do_was_have_a_personal/dmk6a8z/">I wouldn&#39;t be mad if you banned 80% of the users in this thread, interesting how they always comment in packs regarding anything Hillary related, especially when they are able to use it as a step up to dissent the sub, its users and moderators, it&#39;s pretty much a /r/TopMindsOfReddit thread when they decide to hop in with the fake voting.
Once again, another prime topic for discussion and this bullshit is at the top of the thread.</a></p>

<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6xtwhz/call_to_action_the_intelligence_authorization_act/dmjob8f/">The lack of self-awareness in these votes are pretty telling, this entire sub was being smeared with &quot;you believe in x therefore you must support Trump&quot; since before the election in order to devalue topics that were otherwise non related to Trump at all. Didn&#39;t work that direction, now when people suck-up to MSM and get called out for doing exactly that you&#39;re spinning it the other way.
Fact is, any &quot;debunking&quot; or &quot;professional jounalistic discussion&quot; of any of these topics are no more substantial in content than Stephen Colbert and Rachel Maddow&#39;s silly attempts to steer the masses away from inconvenient facts.</a></p>

<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6xtwhz/call_to_action_the_intelligence_authorization_act/dmjo7i7/">Didn&#39;t even have to check the history to see the correlation, we used to get brigaded, now we are getting straight up astroturfed. There&#39;s a slight distinction between the two, but an important one.</a></p>

<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6xtwhz/call_to_action_the_intelligence_authorization_act/dmjo4sx/">Spoiler - It wasn&#39;t, just a load of MSM telling you it was without touching base on any of the details, just like Pizzagate.
Well, it only took a couple weeks since the admins came and performed the cleansing but here were are in the new r/conspiracy, where the posts are astroturfed and substational discussion is derailed and buried.</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, people make some crazy jumps in logic to attack people who are remotely skeptical here.  They:</p>

<p>1)  Post about pedophilia.  Make sure to not back up any claims.  Maybe even post something that&#39;s easily disproved.  </p>

<p>2) Call anyone skeptical of the unverifiable or provably false claims a pedophile or a pedophile defender.  Don&#39;t address their questions.</p>

<p>Then they ask &quot;why are you even here?&quot; to people wondering about sources, authenticity, or veracity of claims.  Certain people would believe a lot less bullshit if their start point was disbelief and they had to be persuaded into believing.  Rather than immediate acceptance and belief of a theory/claim.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Come on...you never answered his REAL question...are you illiterate?</p>

<p>One thing that fascinates me is how these guys try to get under your skin by making things emotional, when obviously they have NO emotion.  If you want evidence for reptilians, there ya go.  Lack of actual compassion.  I wouldn&#39;t attack someone&#39;s LITERACY if they were struggling with a very real moral issue.  I fail to see how these are not rules violations; not that I am accusing, but I fail to see the value in those comments at all.  </p>

<p>The instant end for any discussion on here should be when the person you are responding to tells you what YOUR own state of mind is.  My brother does the SAME thing to me IRL very frequently, and it&#39;s taken a while to get rid of the &quot;killswitch&quot; in your mind that causes internal anguish from these bozos.  Maybe the lowest hanging fruit in terms of getting someone to have a hair trigger reaction.  It&#39;s Schaudenfraude, and I don&#39;t doubt that, maybe subconsciously at a minimum, some people get their kicks off doing it.  It&#39;s almost as scary as your main topic, but obv. way worse in scope.  </p>

That&#39;s why I butt in on these threads, because I understand the emotional attachment, and you cannot.

<p>Which is why you sound like an complete amateur in all your discussions of audio. After all, most professionals have to torrent shit and go on Reddit for advice. Lol.</p>

<p>So you&#39;re running a &quot;chord progression generator&quot; through a chord generator? Lol.</p>

<p>Gonna let it run and then cut it up? Lol, that make a so much sense.

<p>Una Corda is a Kontakt library. </p>

<p>Skinning as in I have the midi, and the skin is whatever actual sound I feel like using in the end. The actual sound is generally less important to me than that &quot;aha&quot; moment of getting a good hook or part down that dictates how the rest of the piece will go.</p>

<p>Sure. But now it&#39;s time for you to tell a tale. Are you a ProTools-y live recording guy, or an electronic music guy? I&#39;m always interested to hear peoples&#39; workflows especially if they&#39;re idiosyncratic. The typical ways to use stuff tends to bore me to death.</p>

<p>Then again, I pirated games back in the days of BBSes.  Not many, because any decent game was like 7 Zip files and took FOREVER.  Still...fun times.  I also was a kid and not making money off software.  There are shades and degrees of skulduggery I suppose.</p>

<p>How &#39;bout Jeremiah 23:18?  Note: I just flipped through my Bible and looked for circled words where I had placemarkers.  I circled that verse well over five months ago...interesting.  I even wrote &quot;tornadoes&quot; next to it.  Pretty cool.  Well, not really, but interesting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Perhaps her abuse at such a young age created her intelligence.</p>

<p>I have a theory that children that have had traumatic experiences develop at least in small part, photographic thinking.  The brain learns to create snapshots, if not seconds to minutes of moving images, as part of the psychosomatic experience.  And this type of pattern then repeats further as the brain develops through time.</p>

<p>While this does not mean they have a perfect memory, nor that they are 100% correct about everything they think or understand, it does provide a window in how some people are able to recall early memories.</p>

<p>And this can sometimes translate to having an increase in intelligence later in life due to being able to thoughtlessly remember information, but again, does not mean they are always correct in thinking.</p>

<p>As for whether the traumatic experience is worth the &quot;trade off&quot;, that depends entirely on the person, if the theory is true of course.</p>

But they will also in a primitive way retain the knowledge they gained from that life or death experience. Hence, PTSD. Hence repressed memories (for survival). Hence the reason trauma based mind control exists. </p>

<p>Have you been an animal (nonhuman animal)?  Can you tell me how an animal (nonhuman animal) thinks?  Can an animal&#39;s brain remember in what is commonly called photographic-memory?  I believe you would need to be a nonhuman animal to tell us definitively, so I&#39;m all ears/eyes to know this.</p>

<p>I am a human, and have had traumatic childhood experiences, so I very much can say why I believe the way I do about how some other humans develop photographic memories after traumatic childhood experiences.  Are you able to say the same?</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t watch the whole thing, but having a mind fragmented by trauma can cause a person to have SELECTIVELY very accurate memory, which is part of why MKUltra is even a thing. </p>

<p>A fragmented mind can focus very deeply and retain very deeply, kind of like ADHD/ADD. </p>

<p>Good drama mongering. Some posters stating the person in question is just trying to sell a book. Actually literally one poster is doing what you are accusing here multiple people off and was downvoted.</p>

<p>The flattering version of this is you being completely intellectually dishonest and trying to cause a scene like some extremist left feminist.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is literally <em>no</em> way to cause enough of a scene over the possibility of child molestation.  How the fuck do people like you think it&#39;s to ANY extent okay to <em>not</em> sound every alarm possible over serious allegations of child abuse?</p>

<p>The idea that you call someone who&#39;s actually concerned about abuse and molestation a &quot;drama queen&quot; beggars belief.  If you had a child and something horrible were happening to them, I don&#39;t see how you wouldn&#39;t want to sound every alarm possible - assuming for the moment that it wouldn&#39;t be you yourself who would be the one causing the abuse in the first place...which at this point, I&#39;m honestly not sure it wouldn&#39;t be.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see your position didn&#39;t shift one bit from triggered hysterical drama queen. When a case happened more than half a decade ago it&#39;s perfectly fine to not go overly emotional especially so if you aren&#39;t personally involved but maybe you are yourself a victim of abuse in that case my condolences. I don&#39;t know anything about the case at hand but having a different opinion on a very specific case doesn&#39;t constitute anything you allege but then again I am pretty sure you are either being intellectually dishonest or just not capable of spotting the difference.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You make a good point, unfortunately the shills have latched onto your comment to try and spur an organic opposition to OP&#39;s post.</p>

<p>It&#39;s true, you don&#39;t see anyone on this sub actually defending pedophilia. Instead you see dismissive comments that usually single out the OP and bully them into submission. It&#39;s pretty easy to spot.</p>

<p>For example; I&#39;ve been coming to this sub for a very long time and never once have I had the inclination to tell somebody how stupid they are because they believe in something that I don&#39;t. And we get a lot of stupid theories here. </p>

<p>The shills regularly distance themselves from the sub with phrases like &quot;they actually believe Topic A here&quot; and &quot;I would never fall for Topic B like the morons here do.&quot;.</p>

<p>As if anyone on Reddit honestly leaves their safety bubble to challenge their own ideas. These shills act like everyone stops in at this sub for a good laugh. That&#39;s how they believe or how they want us to believe that the internet works. </p>

<p>Like walking into a bar full of regulars and not noticing the two loud assholes in the corner that nobody knows. Shills are only here to wear on our constitution. How many waves of bullshit can you take before you break? They&#39;re not here to trick anyone, it&#39;s an endurance game. How many times can you walk into your regular bar and get called an asshole by strangers before you break their nose? </p>

<p>Anyway, I&#39;m rambling but your comment is poignant. Shills don&#39;t defend pedophilia, they mock the idea that any government agency could be involved in human trafficking...because it&#39;s true. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Serious fuckery.</p>

<p><a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is conservative, because conspiracy theorists are conservative, in general. You can&#39;t believe that 9/11 was an inside job, REALLY, and want the government to have more power, so mainstream liberalism is out.</p>

<p>We got Trump elected... the alternative media, including <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, and so honest and duplicitous liberals see us as a threat. We ARE a threat.</p>

<p>Count on a presence here for the foreseeable future, from those who fear us when we speak together. We killed the TPP, through Trump (as much of an ass as he is :)). We got vaccines into the conversation. They have to stop the bleeding, so they are attacking us. Some are ideologues and some are paid.</p>

<p>They stand out like a sore thumb, and as long as people know they are here, they are next to harmless. Actually, I&#39;ve been here for years now, and it has been really instructive to see this sub get actively attacked.</p>

<p>Suddenly, a post attacking Trump has 5000 upvotes. WOW. That is instructive.</p>

This sub, as someone else has already stated, is about questioning every thing and there ARE something things that do seem a bit strange to me when it comes to her story, such as being able to remember things from when she was two since it is very VERY unlikely she would be able to even if she has a high IQ. I can also see why people are miffed about her pushing her book in this since it makes things a bit more sketchy. Do I doubt she was a victim of abhorrent abuse? No. Am I saying anyone who is legitimately harassing her or being unnecessarily malicious are not assholes for being like that to her? No. People here SHOULD question things since that&#39;s a big part of what this sub is for. I don&#39;t mean to come off as rude, but I get the sense that OP is trying to stir things up more and cause a bit of drama.

Trying to downplay someone getting legitimately mad at anyone who comes across as defending pedophilia is greatly, greatly morally corrupt on your or anyone&#39;s part.</p>

<p>People who do things to the youth of our society are deplorable, there is no contesting that, but you seem to have misunderstood what I am trying to say. Yes, reports of sexual abuse should be taken VERY seriously but on the other hand accusations of sexual assault should be taken just as seriously.

<p>I don&#39;t disagree with that.  However, the fact that there is such a proven, ubiquitous epidemic of pedophilia on this planet means that accusations of child sexual assault should be taken VERY seriously and not knee-jerkingly vilified as so many have done in this OP.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I get the feeling many of the people questioning her validity merely feel there is a lack of evidence to her claims.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t get that feeling based on how far they&#39;re going with their &quot;questioning&quot;.  They&#39;re not merely questioning.  They&#39;re heavily attacking via a <em>lot</em> of ad hominems.  They&#39;re going quite a bit further than one needs to in simply &quot;questioning&quot; something.  They&#39;re not really questioning so much as attacking.  That&#39;s a different thing altogether.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>No worries.  Thanks for qualifying and explaining things further.  Appreciated.  Cheers,</p>

<p>This OP has nothing to do with any attempt at &quot;causing drama&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You literally created a thread to call out people who questioned a story you believe in, then have spent the entire thread attacking people and claiming that you&#39;re being victimized by a harassment campaign. That&#39;s the very <em>definition</em> of &quot;causing drama.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Remembering events from early on is not all that out of the ordinary</p>

<p>The vast majority of adults don&#39;t recall memories from earlier than 3 to 4 years old, and full memories don&#39;t typically become clear and common until nearing 5.</p>

<p>So yes, having vivid, detailed memories of being 2 years old <em>is</em> out of the ordinary.</p>

<p>But you know that already, as multiple people in this thread have tried to explain that to you already. You&#39;ve ignored them.</p>

<p>Productive discourse cannot be destroyed by a shill or any other group of actors in a public exchange, its murder is a participatory, mutual affair. </p>

<p>When someone comes at you with bullshit(be it shill or useful idiot, and it pretty much is impossible to tell the two apart; these domestic psyops are designed to recruit unpaid agents to unwittingly parrot and defend propaganda) the best way to shut it down completely is to use cold logic to point out factual inaccuracies, logical fallacies, anything you can demonstrate to be incorrect without having to resort <em>appeal to emotion</em> or <em>guilt by association</em>, for example.     </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are occasions when an individual - myself at times included in this categorization - at the specific moment of refutation, does not have or cannot recall the particular points that would effectively do away with an argument using cold logic.  This is not to say that logic would not be able to thoroughly do away with the argument in question.  it is to say that there are, again, times when an individual either doesn’t recall the specific refutation points that would do away with said argument, or said argument is being pushed by an individual who’s interest is not at all in logically debating in the first place.  They are instead intent only on being what is called in common internet parlance, the proverbial troll.  These types of personalities care not for an argument whether logical, well-thought-through or not.  That is why they’re trolls.</p>

<p>There are many of those here.</p>

<p>As such, and again, productive discourse is regularly enough not even part of the operating mode of conduct as it relates to many individuals who come on to shill certain particularly sensitive points or issues.  “Productive discourse” with these types is simply not possible on regular occasions.</p>

<p>If you are unable to support your arguments with facts and logic, both you and everyone on the community that you would have otherwise posted in would be better served if you educated yourself before posting.

<p>Productive discourse does not require two cooperative parties, if conducted in a public sphere. It is enough to relentlessly stick to the topic at hand in a civil and critical tone. Even if you don&#39;t convince the other party(and you very often won&#39;t) it is clear to undecided or questioning lurkers who follow the exchange that one party is arguing in good faith and the other is being intellectually dishonest. And even if no one else reads the exchange, there is great value in developing your own ability to critically evaluate information. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly, after a trip overseas I kinda always am skeptical about these sex traffic stories. Don&#39;t get it twisted, I am 100% against forcing anyone to have sex against their will, or fucking kids. Period. Full stop.</p>

<p>Having said that, I have spoken with a few bar girls. According to the media, all these women are sex slaves and being taken advantage of. I assure you most are not. Hell, my fiance is a former bar girl. As stupid as that may be (feel free to call me dumb) it is what it is.</p>

<p>I also know a few hookers. Trust me, the money they make has me wishing I was born with a vagina.</p>

<p>Now, some women are being trafficked. That&#39;s fucked up and it needs to stop. But most of the times these groups only hassle consenting adults to push a narrative cause there is big money in exploiting virtuous morons from their money.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the same thing with prostitution. People act like all hookers are poor women down on their luck who are being taken advantage of by evil men. Mea while most of these chicks make more money than all of us and willingly sell their ass cause it&#39;s easy money.</p>

<p>So yeah, I don&#39;t blame folks for being skeptical on this one. It&#39;s like those pedo laws designed to help children, but mostly lock up 18 year olds who happen to be dating a freshman. </p>

<p>Professionals can troubleshoot their own problems</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;re acting like troubleshooting can&#39;t be multitasked, like you can&#39;t somehow work on something while also leaving a question out there in order to see some feedback. It doesn&#39;t have to be a strictly linear process.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Its funny you start asking these noob broducer questions right after making your brand new account.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are no noob questions, everybody is always learning new things. I&#39;d rather be called a noob than maintain some lofty arrogance about something that&#39;s supposed to be creatively fulfilling and fun. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I mean, shit.... where did you go for advice 14 days ago. I mean, you totally don&#39;t have other Reddit accounts, after all.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I never claimed not to have other accounts. Don&#39;t really know what you&#39;re getting at.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sure you do. I own a multimedia production company after working at one of the biggest post-houses in Hollywood for years. A common thing I hear from clients is how the last company they tried to work with was slow, unfocused and unprofessional. On the off chance you actually work in this industry I guess now I know why people have such bad experiences. It&#39;s cause you losers are on Reddit 24/7 and wasting time on shit like sending random midi through cthulu.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sounds like you&#39;re mad people are making music? I don&#39;t really get your angle here at all.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>No need. As a trained, lifelong musician i can write my own arpeggios, lol. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So if you have a synth with an arpeggiator on it, you ignore it and play an arp at 1/32 by hand. Ha. That seems</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And if I ever need to do some horseshit like that I&#39;d use Logic&#39;s arp MIDI FX which is more full-featured than cthulu and can be easily stacked.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Eh, Logic seems to be lapped by Ableton in this department tbh. It&#39;s all personal preference and what you can work better in, though.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Waste of time.... unless, of course, your workload is exceptionally light. There&#39;s no impetus for being deliberate with your composition or for speed and efficiency in mom&#39;s basement.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;re acting as if one uses generative strategies than they are exclusively not composing anything in tandem. I wonder why you have this philosophy. There are many compositional modes out there and I try new things all the time.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hence my saying, &quot;your pirated kontakt libraries&quot;. Guess you missed that.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You said Komplete, which I bought, along with all my NI stuff.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As in you created a piece of jargon to make what you&#39;re doing sound more elaborate or interesting than it really is.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Skinning just means the sound, like how a UI is just a aesthetic skin. I didn&#39;t invent the term, and I wasn&#39;t using it to brag. I don&#39;t really think much of what softsynth sound I end up using as much as the compositional stage.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Lol, called it. Vaporwave producer. Makes sense cause most of you guys have a distain for EDM, since it takes a little more effort than &quot;reskinning&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t really like any vaporwave that came after those initial releases. I like classic Warp, Holly Herndon, Jlin, Reznor&#39;s scores, John Carpenter, and a billion rock bands like anyone else. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>My workflow wouldn&#39;t make sense to you since it involves all phases of multimedia production and because I contract with companies like Sony and ESPN and do in-house work.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Try me!</p>

<p>Why didn&#39;t you admit to it when I called it earlier in the conversation? I knew it. Thanks for admitting it here at least.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>The mere fact you think the only way to get an arp down in accurate 32nds is by hand kinda says it all, man. There are numerous ways to do this that don&#39;t involve using arpeggiators. Why dont you start a thread and ask edmproduction.</p>

<p>And yeah I&#39;m not about to spend anymore time on this convo explaining to you the workflow of multi format mixing in surround, you can read about it if you want.</p>
