<p>That is a lie. He died of Kidney failure in a hospital December 2001. The mainstream was told otherwise because the government wanted to get political points. Good for re-election, among other things. </p>

<p>Plenty. When some one wants to &quot;debunk&quot; a statement by a &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; people point to the main stream media as proof. But is this case that would mean that either the President lied or the New York Times lied. They can&#39;t <em>both</em> be correct. In either case, a trusted pillar of society lied. Did you not notice all of the statements made by George Bush Jr, Dick Chaney, Rumsfeld and others all claiming, repeatedly as nauseum, that Iraq had &quot;Weapons of Mass Destruction&quot;? Iraq had no such thing. The CIA, MOSSAD and FBI said as much. And Iraq still doesn&#39;t. But the government, and the <em>President</em> lied. Bold faced lied! So, if the government, including the President lied then (2002) then why should we trust Obama in2011?</p>

<p>Okay, so to be clear. You are addressing me and me specifically not these &quot;people&quot;  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>But is this case that would mean that either the President lied or the New York Times lied.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Haven&#39;t seen the article but the New York Times can / could simply be wrong, you are looking at the New York Times as though it is one single entity, this piece you are referring to likely was sourced from somewhere else and was a piece written by a single journalist within the NYT.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>They can&#39;t both be correct. In either case, a trusted pillar of society lied.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;d hardly call the New York Times a trusted pillar of society but I digress.  </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Okay so now we have switched from Osama Bin Laden and thus Afghanistan / Pakistan to Iraq, the justification for Iraq may be related to 9/11 but they are hardly one in the same. Afghanistan happened weeks after 9/11, Iraq happened years. I&#39;m not arguing that these entities don&#39;t lie, and they clearly lied in relation to Iraq. Also there is the distinct possibility that the intel was incorrect, the Iraqis were playing a game (not just with the Americans) of deliberate ambiguity.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>But the government, and the President lied. Bold faced lied! So, if the government, including the President lied then (2002) then why should we trust Obama in2011?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well its still to this day a bit inaccurate to call these actions &quot;Bold faced lies&quot; the reality of it is, neither of us know. A limited number of people actually know the full details of the level of knowledge the United States had in the lead up to the Iraq war, I like you am inclined to believe this level of knowledge was much more than being portrayed to the public but this is hardly a foregone conclusion. There is also the <em>small</em> point that these are two different presidents from two different competing parties. These people are out to hurt the United States this is basically indisputable OBL is either dead, or captured and presumed dead by his own there are no other options. Think logically for a minute here, if OBL had been dead for a decade this sort of thing would be quite easy to prove, this is the sort of thing that brings down a reelection campaign, even a presidency. My view has no basis in trusting these people, I just think its beyond ridiculous to establish your view in that OBL died a decade sooner than claimed because New York based news media ran with a story in the months after 9/11 that OBL had died especially with how common these sort of death claims are.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why use the actual guy when you can put a more cooperative asset in his place?  Can you imagine what the CIA or other black op intelligence organization would do to have one of their own successfully become the shotcaller in that terrorist network?  I wonder how many people close to the original OBL would they need to kill in order to fool the rest?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a zero percent chance that the official story is true.  Bin Laden was public enemy #1 and they kill him in the middle of the night, don&#39;t capture him or any of his associated for questioning, take no pictures (at least none shown publicly), and dump him in the water.  They paraded Saddam through the streets and hanged him, but Bin Laden just gets thrown away?  Then many of the members of that SEAL team die mysteriously in a chopper crash?  No way.</p>

<p>The trial of Bin Laden would have been the biggest TV even of our lifetime and an enormous PR boost for Obama, but they didn&#39;t want that?  Bin Laden just happened to be living within a few miles of Pakistan&#39;s largest air force base?  </p>
