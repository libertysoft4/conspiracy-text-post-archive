    <div class="md"><p>I disagree, because the actual elites are highly trained in various fields, while we are intentionally left in the dark. Calling someone an elite is not self destructive or self diminishing, it&#39;s being self aware, that there are (and will always be) people far more intelligent and more skilled people in the world than you are (you need to learn how to exploit their flaws, though). Read some Sun Tzu. Calling them demonic and super human, would be what you are saying. They are not, they just have knowledge, and knowledge is power.</p>

You start talking about elites or globalists and people understand a little and might latch on and decide to dig deeper.

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;ve went too deep m8. Back out and breath. lol.</p>

<p>a lot of people trust MSM (nearly all of the US population). Those people are indeed idiots for doing so, but nonetheless they remember and accept what they are told. Now take those people and use the same terms they were programmed to accept by MSM to tell the real actual truth. </p>

<p>This way these people agree with you because you&#39;re using their past experiences with MSM. MSM is literally backing you up and you won&#39;t scare off those people.  Once they get in deeper you can &quot;red pill them&quot;, start deprogramming them with harder to believe and deeper and more honest truth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>personally, i find it insulting and disgusting to breathe the same air with them. but, in a word, everything.  they are either born without empathy and are psychopats from the beginning or are born normal, but are influenced by the satanic/luciferian elements in that direction and they become sociopaths.  the outcome is the same, a real orvellian society where good is bad and bad is good, everything is upside down.  ruined lives left and right. have a look at the kakistocracy short video from james corbett for a deeper understanding, but please, please listen to the victims who are survivors of luciferian rites

<p>Christianity, Islam and Judaism have done far more damage to the world and its peoples than this Satanist bogeyman you&#39;re pushing. Again, as an atheist, I can&#39;t help but smile when people attack a minor, powerless religion/cult but refuse to go after the biggest paedophilia network in the history of the world, the Catholic Church.</p>
