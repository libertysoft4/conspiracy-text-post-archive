    <div class="md"><p>The trailer looked decent, if it had good reviews I would have seen it... except tom cruise is in it. </p>

<p>Narcos on Netflix has been great. It doesn&#39;t shy away from the fact that our DEA and especially CIA was fucking shit up, and the US politicians were clueless, and most of their policies and motives were just to look good to the American people, when in reality it just made South America worst off. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>About a month ago I was just living in Medellin, Bogota and Cali for six months.  I didn&#39;t research it much but I just got a general feeling for the place and I can definitely see the strong CIA connection there now.  For example, Whatsapp is by far and large the primary way that people communicate now to the point that I think that normal voice calls must be a small minority.  So Facebook bought Whatsapp and of course the CIA at the absolute least has deep hooks into Facebook and possibly even more depending on your view of it.  There is a suspicious pricing model there where text messages are absurdly expensive, even more than the normal price gouging and specific services like Whatsapp are given special data rates.  They have basically funneled everyone into a CIA asset that really circumvents any sort of local control.  Then next door is Ecuador using dollars and Venezuela with the CIA up in their business.  Now I don&#39;t subscribe to the idea that its all the CIA&#39;s fault since I think that Venezuela has done far more damage to itself with its stupid price fixing strategies than the CIA could ever have dreamed about from a distance.  But anyways, yep, CIA all up in that business.  Oh sure the Narcos series was quite good but they really seemed to downplay any CIA involvement to what like just some guy who happens to be in the important places at the right time.  I just think that it was so much more than that.  Also Escobar&#39;s brother saying that yes Escobar was directly dealing with the CIA for a time until whatever went wrong with the relationship.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was shaking my head when he was living in Sebastopol and talking about how great it was.  I just knew that he was living in an escapist hyper-liberal hippy bubble and that it wasn&#39;t the right medicine and that nothing good was going to come from it.  I know Sebastopol well enough and IMO he should have gone to a far Eastern post-Soviet society to get the right sort of medicine that he was desperately needing.  I think that actually a darker, stoic, more cynical and intellectual environment would have been just so much better for him than a fake bubbly jive talking enclave.  Then next thing you know he was I believe out in some desert and then spinning into deep depression and then offed himself.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t be fooled into thinking, however, that Scientology is good. They engage in brainwashing, threaten and intimidate whistleblowers, and have been accused of a number of murders.</p>

<p>This is essentially infighting by bad people, like when the CIA sent Edward Snowden to infiltrate the NSA and get them in trouble because they were spying on ousted CIA director David Petraeus.</p>

In it, and in the interview with Miscavige&#39;s father, they made it sound like Tom gets huge benefits and his personal slaves and a lot of authority, but Miscavige sits on the throne and pulls the strings, and his spot is unassailable because he made them a real religion in the eyes of govt. That was my impression. And I&#39;m not at all pretending to be on the up w Scientology but didn&#39;t Miscavige just &quot;find&quot; new documents for them, also? He has the ability to add and ratify new text, apparently. Pretty easy when you just make shit up, but still seems to point to him as the leader.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know of any good write ups. You have to just look at the timeline on it. Snowden jumped from CIA to NSA very soon after Petraeus went down. Petraeus was caught because they went digging on an unrelated warrant and &quot;found&quot; the information.</p>

<p>One pattern to look for in any case is when the police initiate some kind of investigation that goes nowhere, but they stumble across totally unrelated crimes. The majority of the time, it means they were doing something like illegally wiretapping the person and trying to bring the illegally collected information in without giving away the illegal tap.</p>

<p>A limited hang out would be if they got caught running a small amount of cocaine, and admitted to it, and said that it was limited to a small amount of agents and that those agents and their command would be duly fired/punished/etc, and that &quot;the CIA would never do that again&quot; (when, in reality, not only are they running 1000x times the amount of cocaine that they got caught with, as well as running a similarly enormous amount of heroin/fentanyl/methamphetamine).</p>

<p>I think nearly all movies are created with a deeper meaning as to discredit these events when they happen Irl. For example if this movie played out Irl and u were to tell someone about it, there first thought would be of this movie and say things like that only happen in movies. Is that considered as limited hangout? Thanks</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Possibly.</p>

<p>One thing gets me with that one though. Sure, Kubrick is famous. But if his film was really so damning that they were willing to kill him, and (at least some of) the people involved are extremely powerful people in Hollywood, well surely they could have used said power to prevent said movie from being released, could they not? </p>

<p>After killing him, they&#39;d just need to pause production &quot;due to his death&quot; (justifiable). Then months/years later, just say it didn&#39;t play well with test audiences, proceed to NOT release it on any media whatsoever, and nuke the original film. Problem solved. Sure there may be rumors of a &quot;lost kubrick flick&quot; or some such. Maybe even some short clips and/or still images &quot;leak out&quot;. But that&#39;s all.</p>

<p>I find it hard to believe that he was able to hide the plot from them. Details, sure. But they had to know it was about them. There were too many people involved for there not to be a leak. Why wait to see just how damning it was before defending yourself?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its amazing isnt it(well not really) how all the corruption is all out there for everyone to see. You dont even have to dig that far. In fact, toleration of corruption and criminal actions are just normalized. Its what we expect from government especially the federal government. Meanwhile, people get all upset about racial issues,gender,class issues anything that seperates us out instead of issues  that ALL people can coalesce under do something about like corruption in government, corrupt two party system,lose of rights, the CIA,DEA,FBI running drugs all over the americas  etc etc if they just cared to improve this country THOSE issues would be in the forefront  but people could care less about. Its sad and pathetic </p>

<p>My second thought is that it is absolutely ridiculous for any person to deny that the CIA runs drugs. And once you go down that rabbit hole, well, the whole narrative falls apart. Which is likely why most people continue denying - they like their world view just the way it is.</p>

<p>Other than Tom Cruise is starring in a movie that is literally about the CIA and it&#39;s drug running program? I think <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> will believe it&#39;s some kind of eye opener for &quot;the sheep&quot;. Other than that, it&#39;s just a movie that has been done before. What do all movies have in common? They&#39;re made to keep people interested for 90 minutes, and this one will probably do a decent job of making money. </p>

<p>It gives a good portrayal of how the corrupt destroy those that expose them. Those complicit in that smear campaign should be charged with accessory to murder, because it drove the man to suicide.</p>
