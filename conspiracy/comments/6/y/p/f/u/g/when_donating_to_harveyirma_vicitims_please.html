<p>keep this in mind, research who you are giving money to, and if you can look to send money and aid directly to the victims and not through third parties that piss most of it away paying their staff or running more &quot;please donate&quot; ads.</p>

<p>if you know of legitimate groups trying to help on the ground that are coordinating aid and not taking their own cut please share them here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As someone who lives in Houston and near affected areas, do not donate to anything but a specific local Houston food bank, or a family that you specifically know or have researched. I have no idea where these millions that celebrities have donated are going, but I doubt it is going to pay for the re-homing or repairs that are needed to the most affected, those that were ink sure renters or homeowners. Down here in Texas we take care of our own, and while I don&#39;t want to discourage people from helping, I also don&#39;t want to encourage another criminal influx of donate funds that go only to the salaries
Of those working the funds.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>last night someone asked who was safe to donate to, and to be honest, the only thing that i could come up with was to donate to the people directly somehow.</p>

<p>the BVI, st. martin/st. marteen, st. barts, the bahamas, will get substantial aid from their former colonial masters--UK, france, netherlands. they have a sort of remenant qausi colony relationship with them.</p>

<p>barbuda has only about 1600 people. there are 400,000 people in this sub, instead of $10 bucks to a 3rd party, we could all pick a person to send a $10 gift card too, and our combined effort could give each $2500.</p>

<p>it would be a great way to get the word out about how corrupt and predatory most aid charities are.</p>

<p>anywho, that&#39;s all i can come up with.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>exactly i gave money to the haiti quake and that debacle seriously pissed me off, knowing most of the money i gave went to pay some one sitting in an office not even in haiti really left a bad taste in my mouth.</p>

<p>i figure why not put our paranoia to good use and sniff out a list of  the charities that will actually help people, and then using the list we come up with push those to our friends and family instead of the corrupt ones that are going to pocket the money and fuck the people over.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Irma victim here. Just waiting to see how bad this will be and how much financial pain it will cause for myself, my family of 4, and my 5 animals.</p>

<p>If you are seriously concerned about donations helping people, I will post pictures of any devastation, estimated repair costs and so on. Then you can donate directly to a victim.</p>

<p>If I have no damage, I will be very happy to say so.</p>

<p>This storm hasn&#39;t even hit yet and there are a lot of changes that could happen. I dearly hope so, because we are currently in the crosshairs of this thing.</p>

<p>And, if it doesn&#39;t hit me or damage our lives, I&#39;ll be happy to suggest other ways to donate.</p>

<p>First and foremost is <a href="https://bigcatrescue.org/">Big Cat Rescue</a> in Tampa. They have rescued over 70 big cats and endangered animals and care for them every day 24/7. They are an outstanding group. In fact, send your money to them, not me, regardless of what happens.</p>

<p>Those animals have no clue what is going on in a hurricane but they still need food and care.</p>

<p>I usually donate to them vie Smile Amazon and a quarterly cash donation. Send them anything you can, if you love animals and are inclined to help them in this disaster.</p>
