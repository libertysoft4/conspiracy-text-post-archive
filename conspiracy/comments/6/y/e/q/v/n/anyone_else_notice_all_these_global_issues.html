    <div class="md"><p>How do you propose the eclipse caused the hurricanes? An eclipse it literally just the moon, on its orbit around earth, happen to align with the sun and the earth and cast a shadow on the earth. Next month the moon will pass between the sun and the earth again, but the shadow won&#39;t be cast on us. If you were to be on a spaceship you could fly intothe shadow and witness the eclipse again. </p>

<p>This happens again and again every month until something disturbs either the orbit of the moon or the earth, or the sun goes red giant. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hear ya man, I feel the need constantly to try to wake people up, but when I mention God or Jesus everyone freaks out... all of this stuff that&#39;s happening is biblical, with heavy emphasis on the word BIBLICAL!. I hate religion too, but not Jesus or God, their trying to help us. It&#39;s downright shameful how religion twists scripture forget religion people, their time is up , but you don&#39;t  need religion to be saved. </p>

<p>As for the September 23rd thing, I&#39;m not sure either but can&#39;t help but notice it&#39;s exactly as Johns vision In rev. 12, and I even saw recently that there is a patch of sky in the Virgo constellation that the powers that be have blacked out, every scope capable of seeing it has the same blacked out patch. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>THE part that gets me is people don&#39;t consider for one second the reason that they freak out is, conditioning. I used to do the same thing with one difference, I was a little jealous of those that believed. And then one day I got it and wish more people would. There is no way this is a &quot;Theory&quot; or a &quot;Big Bang&quot;. There is a God there has to be and the fact that I can&#39;t understand it exactly totally makes sense. I can&#39;t figure out who the top of the NWO pyramid is either but that doesn&#39;t mean they don&#39;t&#39; exist. And I&#39;m not trying to convince anyone of anything other than, it&#39;s a possibility. I know what I believe but I&#39;m not pushing that you know? Hell I have always said worship an ashtray if you want as long as you don&#39;t want to kill my family me or my friends I&#39;m good with it.

    <div class="md"><p>What if our species really has been inverted. Meaning, what if there was an agenda, all along, by whomever created mankind and whomever selfishly used our species for its own gain by bringing us into existence and creating our thought structures. What if, all along, Catholicism (prefix &#39;Cat&#39; has been said to refer to an Egyptian, feline goddess, as I heard through Max Spiers interviews) was actually the worship of a Luciferean god of sorts. What if our thoughts, intense, emotions, feelings really do create our reality -- I think we&#39;ve been kept from realizing that what we truly are is empty nothingness, which you can actually notice if you meditate to the point of literally seeing that you have never been who you <em>think</em> you are and that you are awareness/nothingness, and that <em>your entire understanding of who you are and what the world is is just a thought</em>, which isn&#39;t actually you yet the majority of humanity literally believes themselves to be their thoughts about themselves, rather than being their <em>present</em> selves -- and that people have been using this religions narrative as a means of channeling some wild cosmic events.

    <div class="md"><p>Seriously, it&#39;s not gonna be easy but Im fairly certain it is of the utmost importance, and urgency. Mainly to restore our relationship with our creator &amp; Jesus. Many people truly believe that God is a jerk or something, or aloof to our existence. Satan &amp; the other fallen have quite a chess board, they hate us and want us to fail, destroy, blame God etc. </p>

<p>God&#39;s love is evident by this magnificent planet, distinctively unique from all others, a home for his physical plane beings. Satan literally considers us parasites, his &amp; the other fallen&#39;&#39;s jealousy of what God gave us &#39;s what started this whole mess. We&#39;re down here on the lower planes having nothing but a whisper of intelligence, and I imagine they were up there floating around whatever area they were assigned, looking down at these &quot;new kids&quot; frolicking around in our naiive bliss. In our cosmic amusement park. And adhering to the golden rule, I put myself in they&#39;re shoes, and I honestly can understand that initial jealous hatred. After seeing the amusement park, and it&#39;s vast assortment of all things awesome (boobs, wine, sunsets,) to name a mere few, &amp; suddenly that gas giant outpost looked pretty grim. This is where it all went wrong...</p>

<p>Instead of the horrifically tragic &amp; destructive path Satan took to show his disaproval of all this. Why in the ever loving infinite universe didn&#39;t he just go to God with hs grievance? Hell he could of brought many more too as a display he&#39;s not alone in this feeling? This is God were talking about, and he&#39;s loving and generous, not a brutal dictator. So why not say &quot; hey, floating around the universe and doing highly advanced trigonometry to keep all this stuff in order is cool and all, but after seeing all that down there, especially those ladies, it&#39;s caused me to think &amp; feel differently. God loves to fulfill the desires of all his creation. He is literally a happy god, and I see no reason why he wouldn&#39;t have considered they&#39;re feeings, &amp; even saw to it the matter find a workable solution, for all parties involved. </p>

<p>But no, he said f you man I&#39;m outta here! I&#39;m going to earth to play sim city, im going to become my own god, &amp; even create a few just to fuck with people! I&#39;m gonna set up a complex system of religion &amp; government that trust me, will only cause unimaginable suffering. And I&#39;m gonna blame it all on you. End rant.</p>

<p>TLDR; So yeah that&#39;s basically how I sum up this unfortunate situation here, and to use that in a way that hopefully reaches some hearts before this is all over, to find and impliment all means necessary, and travel any distance to remind people what they already know deep down, that God is good, loving, and wants us to live. That we have cleverly been deceived to accept the opposite,  a lie. Crafted by a very smart, very angry spirit  creature on a cosmic chess board where we all lose. Just follow the words of Jesus in the bible, and pray to our heavenly father, and follow no man, for there is only one mediator between you and God, 1TI 2:4-6</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Struggling with my faith but I&#39;m with you 100%. Jesus Christ is the reason I won&#39;t off myself, miserable bastard fed up with life as I am. Job suffered through, I&#39;m probably not gonna get rich like him for serving God nor do I want to. That&#39;s a dumb point to being faithful, God&#39;s supposed to be a spiritual therapist, not a genie. Peace of mind is the gift from God I&#39;m looking for with my faith, material wealth will spoil me further into worsening mental illness.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You too are on the right track! Dude, dude,...you may have heard this before, but this time is way different, You/we are not alone!!! Everything you said is the same I think, I think about suicide every day, it&#39;s gotten to where I was planning every detail to lessen the familial burden, but I just can&#39;t do it &amp; let the bastard&#39;s win. No way, Im dealing with several serious &amp; severe traumas, I can&#39;t even keep up with them all anymore it&#39;s so overwhelming, and like you said, it is just like Job, my case is even so similar it&#39;s downright creepy. As of late on top of all the trauma, I have some crazy ass illness that is so evil, I have these sores all over my body, especially my face that will not heal, they just linger around, get worse, grow even uglier &amp; painful &amp; resemble a methhead in a zombie apocalypse movie.and what&#39;s worse is no dr. Knowing what it is or how to treat it so you take action to remove it yourself &amp; realize this is some truly evil plague cause when you try to remove it it bleeds profusely and generally gets worse, and leaves a scar and then I picture our friend Job, lying in the mud half naked, painful repulsive sores everywhere, no family, no money, no nothing, just msery. And along comes those &quot;friends&quot; those super fine apostles who instead of just helping a brother out with a few kind words they start finger pointing!! Surely you brought this on yourself they said they just add insult to injury and look for blame, making you feel even more alone &amp; hopeless. Which I&#39;m also going through right now. I&#39;ve done nothing but improve my life and self and never expected anything for it besides fellowship, brotherhood. I was crushed by the way this supposed only true religion (JW) treated me&amp; everyone &amp; I noticed even more very serious doctrinal problemz!Thankfully I see know that account was put there as a means of help for us. We should expect to be hated in this world, but I&#39;ve noticed it&#39;s far worse for people who are really spiritual. I think Satan sees us a valuable asset who could possibly accomplish much and singles them out for worse treatment. But please realize, Jesus himself sees us, and knows our terrible pain, but he doesn&#39;t point fingers or sugar coat it, he said this would happen, that it would be awful &amp; cause many to give up, but he also reminds us that it&#39;s very temporary, our loyalty &amp; suffering will be rewarded more than we can yet understand. Isaiah 41:10 is pretty comforting. Can&#39;t remember where it is but another reminds us &quot; happy are the poor, the afflicted etc..they will inherit the earth. But you also said the most important things, material wealth &amp; the likes will only drag us down, but peace of mind and a positive self image are priceless. Thank you for pointing out these important things, I pray you, me &amp; all who call on him in true Ness will remember these things daily, and protect us from the negative spirit of this dying world. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Amen. United we stand, divided we fall. Let us be the church the world desperately needs, because the mainstream ones are corrupted with puritan politics and the prosperity gospel and so much shit.</p>

<p>I&#39;m praying for my family. I&#39;m asking God, they&#39;re atheists, but they&#39;re Christians by virtue of having put up with me when I turned into a psychopathic retard on a cocktail of different medications. I know God gave me my loving family because no one would have been able to handle my meltdowns when I started going mental after puberty.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t evangelize, I don&#39;t tell people &quot;you need to be Christian&quot; because I&#39;m so put off from religion after my experiences with a Calvinist church. I&#39;m a universal reconciliationist, so if that&#39;s heresy and God is the God of Christian fundamentalism and not universal reconciliation, I&#39;d rather suffer in Hell with my family than spend eternity without them, knowing they&#39;re suffering eternal torment while my narcissistic deadbeat ass goes to Heaven, if I did in that case.</p>

<p>Most atheists I&#39;ve met are far more worthy of salvation and whose hearts are more genuinely Christian than a POS like me, that&#39;s why I&#39;m holding out for universal reconciliation. It literally doesn&#39;t make sense to me that they should deserve to suffer God&#39;s wrath when a lot of them have had to leave Christianity due to abusive religious upbringings with fundamentalists. Telling atheists they&#39;re going to hell for being atheists just seems like an affirmation of a petty cosmic tyrant that atheists just cannot believe in. I think God&#39;s better than that.</p>

<p>&quot;You were wrong. I exist, I love you, and though you left the faith, I deem your heart worthy of resurrection for the Kingdom of Heaven. May I please reveal myself to you?&quot;</p>

<p>That&#39;s the sort of God I believe in. Worst case scenario I can accept is oblivion for non-believers. At least then they wouldn&#39;t be suffering for eternity. They&#39;d just become nothing more than memories of Earthly life that I&#39;ll miss for literally eternity.</p>

<p>When one dies, don&#39;t go into the tunnel of light, turn your head 360 degrees and shine the light that you have in yourself. One doesn&#39;t need to be brought light when one already has light in themselves. As the old sunday school song goes, this little light of mine, I&#39;m gonna let it shine... I don&#39;t need Satan&#39;s &quot;light&quot; he ain&#39;t no lightbringer. Shines but doesn&#39;t illuminate. God is the answer, true love, willingness to sacrifice all for the sake of others with the expect of nothing in return, is an affirmation of Christian faith, regardless of stated creed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know about that day, I think the &quot;signs in the heavens&quot; are merely unquestionable mile markers, signalling us that change is at hand, or at the gate. Jesus said no man knows, not even him. But I agree, I look at that upcoming sign, read revelation 12, look at current events &amp; whew....speechless. it says &quot; then war broke out in heaven, and Jesus hurls Satan &amp; the others (a third of the stars) down here, &amp; what he says after that causes one to sigh, &quot; woe to the earth and those dwelling on it, for Satan is now here for a short amount of time, and he is very angry. It&#39;s a hard pill to swallow, only the complete suit of armor by faith in God wI&#39;ll help. And about the &quot; short time &quot; I wonder if it&#39;s 7 years? When there will be another total solar eclipse? This is all conjecture as revelation was meant to be jibberish until the apointed time, so I love discussions trying to find the truth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How do you propose the eclipse caused the hurricanes? An eclipse it literally just the moon, on its orbit around earth, happen to align with the sun and the earth and cast a shadow on the earth. Next month the moon will pass between the sun and the earth again, but the shadow won&#39;t be cast on us. If you were to be on a spaceship you could fly intothe shadow and witness the eclipse again. </p>

<p>This happens again and again every month until something disturbs either the orbit of the moon or the earth, or the sun goes red giant. </p>
