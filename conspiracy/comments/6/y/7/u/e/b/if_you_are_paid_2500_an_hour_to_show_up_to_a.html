<p>A Word To The Wise</p>

<p>“If you are paid $25.00 an hour to show up to a rally to “counter” the other party using physical force and violence, you are not a “counter protestor.” You are a mercenary.</p>

<p>There is no need for further debate on this. You were paid to attack someone you don’t know for reasons that you couldn’t care enough about to go there for free. You did your “job” and collected your check and your reimbursement of expenses. You’re a mercenary.</p>

<p>Not a Patriot. Not a Social Justice Warrior. Not a Defender of Freedom or Liberty. Not an upholder of Truth or Justice. None of those things you claim to be. You are a mercenary.</p>

<p>And mercenaries are not lawful combatants and deserve whatever comes their way at the hands of the people they are attacking.</p>

<p>You have no 1st Amendment rights when you’re a mercenary.</p>

<p>Doesn’t matter what side you’re on. Doesn’t matter what cause you’re showing up to disrupt. If you can’t express yourself peacefully through diplomatic means, then you better be prepared to meet your maker at the hands of someone who is only barely keeping their own violent tendencies at bay through a massive exercise of self-control.</p>

<p>I know it sounds romantic to attend these rallies and get crap started with the other side. And when you’re young and passionate, it’s really easy to get whipped up into a frenzy of raw emotions. There is a reason why young people are preferred when it comes to warfare. They are easy to manipulate and control and set off.</p>

<p>But I’m telling you all this right now. You’ve got no idea what road you are starting down. Romance and idealism wears off really fast when you’re laying in a pool of your own blood trying to stuff your intestines back into your torn abdomen.</p>

<p>I’ve been lucky enough to go forty-two years without having to put the skills I learned in the Marines to use. I continue to train and keep those skills up to date because I see the madness that is happening all across this country. I don’t train to attack others like you do. I train to defend others FROM you. I’m not alone either.</p>

<p>There are thousands of men and women in this country who have seen war and death and don’t want any more to do with it. They want to live in peace. They want to forget the things they’ve had to do in the service of their country. They want to raise their kids and have family BBQs and build tree houses and soap box derby cars and have tea parties.</p>

<p>They don’t want this crap that you’re selling.</p>

<p>You have the extremist left and the extremist right that are doing their best to get something started. To force us into a Civil War. Even in the 1860’s, the violence between the North and South was nowhere near what we see today. Nowhere. Even. Close.</p>

<p>And yet we still had a war of ideology that consumed hundreds of thousands of lives.</p>

<p>All you young and naive kids on both sides of this equation who think that having a Civil War will advance your agenda or restore your vision of what you think is America, just remember this… Those of us older generations aren’t having any of this crap. And if you jump off, you better be prepared to deal with US. We don’t care what color you’re wearing or what sign you’re holding if you come after us, our friends, our family, our co-workers, our neighbors, etc., WE will kill you.</p>

<p>So remember that when you’re thinking that it’s just Left vs Right, or Liberal vs Conservative, or Commie vs. Fascist. We are the variable you’re not considering.</p>

<p>That “Silent Majority” that you pretend does not exist is getting really sick and tired of your bullshit.</p>

<p>— Geoffrey B. Higginbotham Major General, USMC (Ret.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is there any real evidence or people coming out that they were paid $25 or whatever to take part in a riot or even a protest? I don&#39;t take craigslist adds as evidence btw. Most of the &quot;evidence&quot; that I have seen was either debunked or actual satire by antifa and other organisations.</p>

<p>This feels more like a strawman argument to make any protest against your point out to be illegitimate</p>

<p>Other point:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You have no 1st Amendment rights when you’re a mercenary.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why? Is there any law against mercenaries that I don&#39;t know? Are soldiers not also basically mercenaries (getting paid for violence).</p>

<p>No. As long as they&#39;re being peaceful, paid or not they absolutely are allowed to congregate, protest, etc.</p>

<p>The individual quoted is specifically talking about people paid to protest in a fashion NOT peaceful. So your second point is true, but not what is being discussed.</p>

<p>If we&#39;re not talking about a violent definition of &quot;attack&quot; then obviously you&#39;re correct. But the focus of the entire quote posted by OP is clearly about violence. So I don&#39;t even know why you&#39;re mentioning the peaceful protesters.</p>

<p>A mercenary is a person who takes part in an armed conflict, who is not a national or a party to the conflict, and is &quot;motivated to take part in the hostilities essentially by the desire for private gain and, in fact, is promised, by or on behalf of a party to the conflict, material compensation substantially in excess of that promised or paid to combatants of similar ranks and functions in the armed forces of that Party&quot;</p>

<p>That&#39;s the definition. Taken from above:</p>

</blockquote>

<p>This is literally clear as bloody day; the discussion is about people who are <em>paid</em> to use <em>physical force</em> and <em>violence</em>.</p>

<p>What you have difficulty with is the paid part. I can understand that, because I&#39;ve not personally seen concrete proof either. But it&#39;s a hypothetical discussion at the very least. <em>IF</em> you were paid to cause violence, <em>THEN</em> you are legally classified as a mercenary.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that&#39;s a tangential point.</p>

<p>The point is that people who think they&#39;re riding a gravy train, violently getting involved in a fight they&#39;re only interested in as a result of money, means that sprucing up the rhetoric with terms like &quot;counter protester&quot; is complete bullshit. They&#39;re literal criminals. And as you say, violence immediately negates 1st amendment rights. So violent protesters, or even legit protesters, who might yell and scream about the freedom of speech and expression of those getting violent, are entirely wrong.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To the edit, haha you too, don&#39;t look at my post history. I&#39;m not super popular on here being pretty liberal. It&#39;s not usually this nice but I do tend to respond only in kind.</p>

<p>I agree with all of your main post as well. i.e. ANTIFA as an idea is something I might support, but going around breaking shit because a campus hosts a speaker they don&#39;t like is self defeating. You can&#39;t fight fascism by not allowing dissent. It&#39;s like the definition of being a fascist. </p>

<p>I just think most of this discussion is moot as there really hasn&#39;t been proof they&#39;re being paid. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>ANTIFA&#39;s violence blows my mind in all the worst ways. The hypocrisy is so blatant that I don&#39;t even know where to start, or what the point would be in pointing it out.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not especially popular either XP I certainly don&#39;t discriminate based on political ideology. I probably fall on the liberal side of the spectrum generally, but I also appreciate some conservative views. That some seem to think one needs to pick a side eliminates the reality of a political spectrum and compresses everything into a binary: For or against. As much as I can fall victim to the all-or-none paradigm at times, it&#39;s nonsense.</p>

<p>Someone did post a bunch of info re: paid protesters here in the comments, though at a very brief glance it did not appear that they were paid specifically to commit violence, so much as ideally they would incite violence from their opposition. However, I imagine some did themselves commit violence, quite possibly a very small minority of these paid protesters, and so the message is addressing (potentially) a very small number of individuals.</p>

<p>The point may or may not be especially relevant as it stands, but generally it is correct by definition.</p>

<p>Good luck, friend. May we all find peace.</p>

<p>Has there been a study concerning this subject that shows what you&#39;re espousing to be true?  I don&#39;t doubt that it could be true, but I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve seen any evidence for it.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Agreed. Interestingly enough, you will see media groups from both ends of the political spectrum push the idea that the extremists on both ends represent the majority of both sides. That&#39;s one of the reasons that I believe the media is responsible for the division in this country.</p>

<p>I listen to quite a bit of conservative media and they do this regularly. I know that more left-leaning media does this as well. Even though people will complain that they are tired of liberal media painting anyone on the right as old, white, and racist, they will overgeneralize and misrepresent the majority of folks on the left without an ounce of self-awareness.</p>

<p>Sorry to go a bit off topic, but I needed to get that out. Have a good day!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not. My opinion is that when you have both sides complaining about paid agitators but neither one has any concrete evidence it&#39;s possible that it&#39;s not even happening. Both sides are triggered by this because it knocks the wind out of their sales. They both claim the other side is more violent to vindicate their own violence and they both claim the other side is placing paid agitators among their ranks because it&#39;s hard for people to accept that legit loonies commonly hold the similar extremist political views as the alt-right and the communists and are drawn to these movements. The end result is you have people on both sides of the aisle mostly fed up with poor governance harming the people of the United States but the only people voicing opinions on how to fix things are blaming their problems on other disadvantaged groups. The great majority of us in the US work significantly harder than we are paid for but we are taught that other impoverished groups in our country are the reason for our suffering. It&#39;s tough but we all need to look past skin color, religion, creed, and any other bullshit arbitrary reason to hate each other. We need to look for our similarities: we all want to be successful, raise families, grow as individuals but we fight over how it&#39;s to be done. We can all do better for ourselves and our neighbors by just giving a fuck. </p>

Has any one here actually taken Craigslists jobs before, especially an event job? 50% of the time they pay those out in cash, since it&#39;s a drop in the bucket for the people paying for whatever menial shit they need done.</p>

<p>Send an ad, get replies, delete said ad so if anyone took a screenshot it will be disputed and people won&#39;t consider it worth arguing. Then pay your employees in cash or &quot;travel reimbursement&quot; lol.</p>

<p>How hard is it to find people that watch way too much news and have a humanities degree, and who are angry about their circumstance and feel cheated? It isn&#39;t, they are bred all over the United States.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, aimed at the jobless ones who are suffering in their circumstance with no way to make their way to Berkeley and so on. It&#39;s aimed at anyone post college or in college, because instead of realizing the college institution jipped them out of their money, they are blaming the Koch brothers.</p>

<p>Paying them just helps pad numbers for the perception of a massive grassroots movement, because how do you argue against the will.of the people. I remember similar rhetoric with the tea party in early 2000. The real trouble makers are paid by someone more nefarious, whether part of the police or paid to create violence. </p>

<p>They aren&#39;t giving those guys that much responsibility in the groups besides being &#39;operation human shield&#39; for the &quot;By any Means Necessary&quot; and groups like that, they just want them to maybe smash a few windows and protect the ideologues.</p>

<p>Yes, if your numbers aren&#39;t what you expect, it makes sense to pay protestors. Perception is key in this silly media war right?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The receipt is for, mostly, the benefit of whomever would pay protesters. 1) for thier active participation, and 2) most importantly, for thier confidentiality.</p>

<p>So, say I wanna find 100 people to show up and protest Futurama seasons 1 through 5 being removed from Netflix. But, I want it to look organic, and totally not something that I orchestrated. If I&#39;m offering incentives for participating, then it is in my best interest to also insure that they don&#39;t undermine my messege by being paid.</p>

<p>If I give them cash, then they can take it and just go home. If I pay them after the demonstration, then they can go home and blog about this quick buck they just made and tell others how to do so.</p>

<p>To keep it quiet, there needs to be something agreed to, beyond a verbal agreement, if I want to keep my involvement a secret. If I pay them, and give them a form saying &quot;this is money for your participation, by accepting payment, you&#39;re agreeing to keep this a secret or else we demand our money back.&quot;  if I pay them and don&#39;t notify them of the expectation of secrecy, they&#39;ll sell thier story to literally anyone with an interest in exposing my involvement, undermining any affect of the demonstration, because why not?</p>

<p>Why not take 2 paydays instead of 1,with basically zero extra work?</p>

<p>So, without an agreement, none of the &quot;independent paid demonstrators&quot; theory makes any sense.</p>

<p>In the age of social media, it would have to be orchestrated by an agency in charge of a collective, none of any of the operating agents could have a social media presence that could be linked to one another at all, in anyway. Because the agency in charge of the individual actors would have all of thier names on file, whatever contracts they operate for, and a means to pay them. Connect 2 of the employees, and you can extrapolate that there are more of those kinds of paid demonstrators, and a little digging exposes my involvement, because I&#39;d have to pay the agency, as well as have verified agreement with them, or they could just take my money and have a pizza party.</p>

<p>Like Futurama is important to my interests, so I understand how helpful a big demonstration would be to make my point. But if I can&#39;t garner interest from people through excitement or passion, then there is only really intimidation or a paper trail means to get people to show up. And knowing it&#39;s my mission and my cause, I would not expect some agency to cover the costs of putting on an artificial demonstration just to make it look more real, because profit is how companies stay in business, and why would they trust me to pay them if I&#39;m willing to pay a bunch of people for misleading the public for my own interests. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can see that, but I also see a society with very vitriolic people and systems to search out those individuals are becoming easier to congregate (former protests, Facebook groups, and such). It&#39;s kinda like that joke how people who used to have sex with animals always felt alone and like freaks until they discovered internet chattrooms. It&#39;s also the reason it&#39;s easier to gather all the bigots in easy places and subreddits like the dreaded coontown.</p>

<p>However, it&#39;s much easier with the actual black bloc protesters and groups like By Any Means Necessary since they police their own and are hypervigilant to anyone filming them. They already act with secrecy and will block out anyone but their video of the event to frame it how they want, of course the conservative YouTubers do enjoy antagonizing but that seems like a two way street.</p>

<p>I&#39;d look more to those organizations and how they plan, and execute their protests, along with their messaging public and private, but I don&#39;t think I could fake it that hard to get in anyway to find out.</p>

<p>People with money have infiltrated protests and movements before and often in American history.</p>

<p>Now I don&#39;t want to pin this all on Soros and the like, because I think this is more multilateral involving paid actors in the Alt-Right, which I believe based on the lack of funding they receive from fans online, unless it&#39;s funded through Bitcoin, which most Hatreon users accept.</p>

<p>Of course there is also the aspect of cops infiltrating as Black Bloc to incite violence like happened in Canada around 2007-10 </p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/D5RaaM3-YYk">https://youtu.be/D5RaaM3-YYk</a></p>

<p>The amount of violence I&#39;ve seen doesn&#39;t seem natural compared to occupy wall street and other movements, this whole year just feels off to me. I don&#39;t believe Joe T. CollegeStudent is getting paid though, or the free speech side of the right either. It&#39;s the more nefarious sects of both groups that concern me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, I agree with most of you&#39;re overall point.... However</p>

<p>The data mining and hyper self policing of certain communities means that organizers wouldn&#39;t have to pay anyone to show up for a rally.</p>

<p>No one on the left would have to find someone to act like a Nazi at a protest, the world is teaming with them. No conservative group needs to find some liberals to go counter protest something, libs are happy to show up and meet like minded folks.</p>

<p>However, I agree forever adamently that movements and protests are manipulated to be more antagonistic and violent, but that it&#39;s a wholly orchestrated effort (in the US) based in organizations like the CIA. It&#39;s scarier than &quot;big money is operating vigilanti mobs&quot; because that would be a mess, especially in capitalism where everyone is trying to run with the bug dogs, you&#39;d have dim, entitled narcissistic ambitious types who fully misunderstood Machiavelli, figured they&#39;d give chess a shot and it&#39;d be practically funny. Litigation everywhere, if anyone got hurt or killed or a check bounced, thier families would sue and blow their cover and destroy the operation.</p>

<p>But, American government organizations have a long standing tradition of breaking up opposition groups and love subverting anything that costs the defense department money, including peace organizations and gatherings of the working poor that are suffering from malnutrition and watching thier kids get sicker and sicker from contaminated water.</p>

<p>See, you don&#39;t need to look too hard to find people with motivation to disrupt free speech. We pay them with taxes, and the money trail stops in the federal government. </p>

<p>Is there any real evidence or people coming out that they were paid $25 or whatever to take part in a riot or even a protest?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p>Have pasted a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6ubn6p/keep_your_eyes_open_vegas/dlsui4s/">previous comment</a> I made when one of those ads was posted here about Vegas/Charlottesville linked to Crowds on Demand. Difficult to verify the ads but Crowds on Demand is a legit company and their CEO that admits that they hire people for: &quot;PR stunts, politicians looking for supporters (or protesters against their opponents), interest groups and individuals.&#39;&quot; There&#39;s also the video evidence of DNC operatives admitting to planting &#39;paid agitators&#39; at events to cause trouble.</p>

<hr/>

<p>For those that missed it, similar was recently posted in relation to the Charlottesville attack on 4chan except <a href="https://archive.fo/gV3QX">the ad</a> said <a href="https://boards.4chan.org/pol/thread/137272319/imagine-my-shock">Charlotte, NC</a> not Charlottesville, VA. About 4 hours away by car/coach. However <a href="https://deplorablekel.com/2017/08/13/did-crowds-on-demand-bus-rioters-into-charlottesville-virginia/">people on Twitter</a> claim crowds of protesters were bused into Charlottesville. One user <a href="https://archive.fo/jjxb8">posted this</a> implying it it shows bussed-in Trump supporters but if they are paid protesters that changes things.</p>

<p>For what it is worth Crowds on Demand (CoD) does <a href="https://i.imgur.com/rh8mZxY.png">appear to be a legit company</a> though but that obviously doesn&#39;t mean these craiglist ads are. Adam Swart, who <a href="https://archive.fo/3IF4V">worked as a political organizer</a> in Jerry Brown’s successful election campaign for Democrat Governor of California in 2010, is the founder and CEO of CoD. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>metro.co.uk <a href="https://archive.fo/N3skq">source</a></p>

<p>We caught up with Adam Swart, the founder and CEO of Crowds On Demand - a business that pretty much does what it says on the tin.
Swart filled us in on his typical booking: &#39;We specialise in getting our clients lots of attention. &#39;The right kind of attention through crowd based action.&#39; Detailing his typical customers, Swart added: &#39;We work with companies conducting PR stunts, <strong>politicians looking for supporters (or protesters against their opponents), interest groups and individuals.&#39; Swart confirms US politicians have used his services</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not sure if relevant but there is a letter from him on the FCC&#39;s site on behalf of the National Association of African American-Owned Media (NAAAOM).</p>

<p>NAAAOM’s mission is &quot;to eliminate racial discrimination and secure the economic inclusion of truly 100% African American owned media through fair contracting and equal treatment practices.&quot;</p>

<p>Anyway, we already have proof that DNC operatives are prepared to send paid protesters and agent provocateurs to sabotage rallies and events by inciting violence. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Two top Democratic strategists have exited the presidential campaign after explosive undercover videos showed them discussing voter fraud and <strong>their roles in planting paid agitators at campaign events</strong> for Republican candidate Donald Trump.</p>

<p>Robert Creamer, founder of Democracy Advocates and the husband of Rep. Janice D. Schakowsky, Illinois Democrat, stepped down from the campaign Tuesday, a day after Scott Foval was fired from his post as national field director of Americans United for Change.</p>

<p>The first video shows Democratic strategists discussing how they hire agitators — including union members, homeless people and the mentally ill — to incite violence by provoking Trump supporters on camera at campaign stops.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://m.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/oct/18/undercover-video-shows-democrats-saying-they-hire-/">Source: Washington Times</a></p>

<p>DNC operative Scott Foval says in the video: &quot;When they’re outside the rally, the media will cover it no matter where it happens. <strong>They key is initiating the conflict</strong> by having leading conversations with people who are naturally psychotic.</p>

<p>&quot;I mean honestly, it is not hard to get some of these assholes to pop off. It’s a matter of showing up, to want to get into the rally, in a Planned Parenthood t-shirt. <strong>Or, Trump is a Nazi, you know. You can message to draw them out, and draw them to punch you</strong>.
&quot;</p>

<hr/>

<p>&quot;If you’re there and you’re protesting and you do these actions, you will be attacked at Trump rallies. That’s what we want&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We&#39;re starting anarchy here&quot;</p>

<p>But as a non-lawyer with access to the internet I am not sure that baiting someone to hitting you is inciting violence.

<p>Although that section you quoted should really have the definition of what a riot is, in the section called riots. Apparently just in the next section.</p>

<p>Nothing deceptive in those statements and plenty more like it made in the video. Video evidence that would be accepted in court.</p>

<p>Also, he wasn&#39;t prosecuted because the AG gave him immunity in exchange for the uncut footage. Footage that shows he deliberately misled or outright lied about the content several times. </p>

<p>So, why can&#39;t you answer the simple question. He was caught deceptively editing his videos to produce a different result than the uncut footage. He has refused to release the uncut footage. Why?</p>

<p>You think it was faked and somehow with editing those words were put into their mouths. </p>

<p>Why didn&#39;t the two individuals dispute the evidence? Why didn&#39;t they sue Project Veritas for defamation and loss of income? </p>

<p>Why didn&#39;t they sue their employer for wrongful dismissal? </p>

<p>Wait, maybe Russia was behind it. Maybe it forced Foval and Creamer to say those words while being secretly-recorded. Yes, that must be it.</p>

<p>Seriously; just admit it.  You hate freedom.  You <strong><em>want</em></strong> everyone to be a slave; locked in a 2x2 cubicle for goodness&#39; knows how many hours a day, and unable to do anything other than watch mindless propaganda and consume industrial waste masquerading as food for a few hours at night, before getting up to do the same thing the next day.</p>

<p>As for the &quot;they weren&#39;t all bad&quot; argument, if you mean they aren&#39;t all murderers, you&#39;re correct. But they&#39;re 100% pieces of shit to the last fucking one of them. Here&#39;s why:</p>

<p>They weren&#39;t chanting about General Lee, they were chanting &quot;Jews will not replace us&quot;. They weren&#39;t carrying signs that tried to cleverly explain their position, they were carrying torches and Nazi flags. And the ones who weren&#39;t, stood proudly shoulder to shoulder with those who were. So fuck all of them.</p>

<p>If it were a moderate protest, or about General Lee AT ALL, 1) the legitimate protesters would have made those people leave if they outnumbered them, or 2) if the neo-nazis and KKK outnumbered the legitimate protesters, <em>the legitimate protesters would have left,</em> not stood side by side with people with SS bolts on their neck doing Nazi salutes. Simple as that. So one more time, since it bears repeating: fuck those Nazi wannabe pieces of filth.</p>

<p>you chose to focus on the Jewish &quot;Nazi&quot; [sic] who ran into a crowd</p>

<p>The Charlottesville terrorist attack was the topic at hand, so yes, for the purpose of this discussion I focused on it. That doesn&#39;t  have any bearing on whether I condemn other terror attacks (I do condemn them).</p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen no evidence Fields is Jewish, and see no relevance in saying such a thing unless you&#39;re trying to disassociate him from the rest of the United the Right marchers. Blaming the Jews (or in this case, a purported Jew) is totally transparent.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>that was beating the shit out of his car</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I saw the whole video. He was up the street from the victims, nobody was attacking his car. Then he started to roll towards them, slowly at first, then accelerated hard. Yes, <em>as he was driving fast with the obvious intent to hit the victims,</em> people started hitting his car. And yes, <em>once he had hit them,</em> people continued to hit his car. Imagine that.</p>

<p>Your debating sucks, you present no evidence, it&#39;s just low effort bullshit aimed at the lowest common denominator. Bring a real argument, or don&#39;t bother.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Being a mercenary is a very specific term that doesn&#39;t apply to people being paid to protest.</p>

<p>Art 47. Mercenaries</p>

<ol>
<li>A mercenary shall not have the right to be a combatant or a prisoner of war.</li>
<li>A mercenary is any person who:
(a) is especially recruited locally or abroad in order to fight in an armed conflict;
(b) does, in fact, take a direct part in the hostilities;
(c) is motivated to take part in the hostilities essentially by the desire for private gain and, in fact, is promised, by or on behalf of a Party to the conflict, material compensation substantially in excess of that promised or paid to combatants of similar ranks and functions in the armed forces of that Party;
(d) is neither a national of a Party to the conflict nor a resident of territory controlled by a Party to the conflict;
(e) is not a member of the armed forces of a Party to the conflict; and
(f) has not been sent by a State which is not a Party to the conflict on official duty as a member of its armed forces.</li>
</ol>

<p>The point being is that to be a mercenary you specifically have to have no interest in the cause, be introduced by a non-state actor, and be involved in an ARMED CONFLICT. For this reason, people being paid to protest don&#39;t count.</p>

I&#39;m sorry but your ignorance is showing there.</p>

This &quot;General&quot; is a paper tiger. The Alt  right is all of a sudden realizing that peace-loving no longer means &quot;pacifist&quot; and they don&#39;t know how to respond but accuse those who have given up peaceful protests to avoid being kettled and arrested en masse while the Nazis HELP subdue them for their cop buddies. Civil war? It started a long time ago. It&#39;s just now that the anti fascists are done playing peacenick while the Nazis are allowed to roam the streets with assault rifles and brutalize at will.

<p>Some certainly do and there&#39;s nothing wrong with that. Considering that he&#39;s our president if even half of what has been reported is true then that would be a pretty big deal.

    <div class="md"><p>White nationalism is not a form of government, for one. For two, I never compared the two. Either option is evil. Communism does not redistribute the wealth because in a true communist society there is no wealth. How would there be anything to distribute when profit and property is outlawed? What incentive does one have to work hard and produce when one is guaranteed everything they need will be provided by the government? Fear of death? Yeah, maybe that would work except the ruling class may kill you regardless of your standing with the party just because. Mao and Stalin proved that point millions of times over. </p>

<p>The device you are browsing reddit on right now would not exist without capitalism. To each according to his need also means there is no reason to do anything beyond your societies basic requirements. Why would someone invest the time and money (well, not money because profit is outlawed) into creating new things when there is little to no reward for doing so?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Communism is an oppressive system just the same. It&#39;s the same centralization of authority to a state, which dictates how I must live my life, express myself, utilize my labour and resources and ultimately how my life may end. You may think they&#39;re the exact opposite of each other, but for the common man, it&#39;s all the just fascism to us in the end. Democracy isn&#39;t amazing, but it&#39;s certainly better. It&#39;s a more likely middle ground, though now it&#39;s being heavily manipulated by extremist parties throughout the western world as well. This is why we must recognize fascism in all forms, and work to avoid it overcoming us peacefully before we have to do it with force. </p>

<p>Mussolini was ultimately a communist, Stalin too. Everyone likes to point at Hitler too as &quot;fascist&quot; the fuck you think the &quot;National Socialist&quot; portion of his Nazi party meant? Not communist? It&#39;s all the same!</p>

The fact that it isn&#39;t happening would also explain why you don&#39;t see evidence of it.</p>

<p>I <em>do</em> believe that some of the protesters on both sides are FBI, or other investigative groups, but I just don&#39;t see the need for, or the evidence of, paid protesters. </p>

<p>We&#39;re an opinionated country and there are a lot of young people, both conservative and liberal, who are out of work. I just don&#39;t find it hard to believe that there are thousands of young people who are out there protesting of their own accord. </p>

<p>This is strictly anecdotal, but I have family members whose churches traveled to DC for the march for life, and I couple of dozen people in my population 500 town went for the women&#39;s march. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What if they don&#39;t get a check for it because they are salaried?  </p>

<p>I agree that a lot of it is organic, or simply people being manipulated without there awareness. Once you get all the people there, it only takes a few salaried spooks to turn things violent. </p>

<p>I wonder how often it is the spooks bringing the weapons to disperse to their manipulated minds. If they do it with explosives for frame jobs you think sticks and bats wouldn&#39;t be a stretch. </p>

<p>Thanks for the well thought out response. </p>

<p>The Left practically invented NGOs, as far as I&#39;m concerned.  Add to that, the amount of evidence I saw on 4chan that the JIDF are absolutely real.  I don&#39;t have any difficulty believing this whatsoever.  I&#39;m sure it happens, on both sides.  Occupy Wall Street repeatedly complained about the number of homeless and mentally ill people who the cops flooded them with.</p>

<p>No evidence there were paid protesters, that&#39;s the whole point. I could simply call the author a paid shill, but where&#39;s the evidence?</p>

<p>“If you are paid $25.00 an hour to show up to a rally to “counter” the other party using physical force and violence, you are not a “counter protestor.” You are a mercenary.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/6y71mv/if_you_are_paid_2500_an_hour_to_show_up_to_a/">https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/6y71mv/if_you_are_paid_2500_an_hour_to_show_up_to_a/</a></p>

<p>Honestly, I saw someone post a archived Craiglist ad that was posted &quot;1 minute ago&quot; as evidence that there&#39;s paid actors. Obviously they made the ad. Anyone can make any ad at anytime, so what&#39;s sad is that the entire argument is made up.. to be able to claim the right to be violent, in response to a true false flag.</p>

<p>Literally, this shit is absurd, and in both places, people eat it up. Willful ignorance at it&#39;s best.</p>

<p>Scott Foval, who was the national field director of Americans United for Change, a 501(c)(4), was filmed by Project Veritas stating  that they sent paid protestors, including mentally ill people, to disrupt Trump rallies. Foval was fired after the tape came out. AUC was a relatively small (between $1 and $10 million) organization that fought Bush then supported Obama. Its first president, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Woodhouse">Brad Woodhouse</a> was communications director of the DNC from 2009 to 2013 and was president of the infamous Correct the Record PAC in 2016.  <a href="http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php/Americans_United_for_Change">liberal source</a> <a href="https://capitalresearch.org/article/americans-united-for-change/">conservative source</a>. 
Although Americans United for Change was ostensibly inactive in the 2016 election and did not file any disclosures, it did receive about a million from <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/expends/vendor.php?year=2016&amp;amp;vendor=Americans+United+For+Change">reporting entities, including $500,000 from Pelosi.</a>. </p>

<p>So what does this mean? In decreasing order of confidence:</p>

<p>1)We know that politicians openly send staffers and volunteers to their opponents&#39; events to monitor or disrupt.  </p>

<p>2)It&#39;s virtually certain that they are also sending people covertly to monitor their opponents.   </p>

<p>3)It&#39;s highly likely that campaigns send people covertly to non-violently disrupt opponents&#39; events (e.g. shouting questions or insults).  </p>

<p>4)It&#39;s likely that Democrats provided support for the disruption of Trump rallies.  </p>

<p>5)It&#39;s likely that at least some of the Trump rally disruptions were planned by people paid by the DNC.</p>

<p>Where I think posts like OP&#39;s go wrong is when they extrapolate from Trump rallies to all protests. There&#39;s a decades long history of militant leftist activism with a long history of opposing and being opposed by Democrats as well as Republicans. The same groups (and some of the same people) who were fighting the right in Charlottesville were smashing Starbucks in Seattle back in 1999. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its whataboutism is that it is.  Its misleading the discussion away from O&#39;Keefe being caught as woefully misrepresenting people with his recordings and trying to change the narrative to &quot;Pretty much every video has an agenda&quot; which isn&#39;t the point. The point is that O&#39;Keefe has been caught lying and misrepresenting people in videos in the past and should not be taken as a creditable source.</p>

<p>Just like your post obviously have an agenda of blurring the discussion into one about how everyone edits their videos in an effort to make O&#39;Keefe&#39;s major infractions seem like something that everyone does.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Haha nice theory, Watson, but no, it&#39;s actually you who is obfuscating the facts. </p>

<p>Your own link states that the lawsuit he settled on was &quot;filed on the assertion that O&#39;Keefe broke a state law prohibiting the surreptitious recording of someone&#39;s voice and image.&quot; </p>

<p>The case was about secret recording, it has nothing to do about what was on the tape and thus nothing about misrepresenting people.</p>

<p>So now why are you lying? What&#39;s your agenda, Watson? </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>A report in 2010 by the office of the California attorney general said that O&#39;Keefe and Giles were given immunity from prosecution when they agreed to provide complete and unedited copies of videos made in Los Angeles, San Bernardino and National City.</p>

<p>ACORN employees &quot;may be able to bring a private suit against O&#39;Keefe and Giles for recording a confidential conversation,&quot; according to the report, completed while now-Gov. Jerry Brown was attorney general. Brown had been asked to investigate by then-Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger.</p>

<p>Among O&#39;Keefe&#39;s deceptions, the report said, was that in the videos he is shown wearing &quot;stereotypical 1970s pimp garb&quot; but that when he visited the ACORN offices, he was wearing a suit and tie.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Did you not read the whole thing?   </p>

<p>The only reason he wasn&#39;t prosecuted for the ACORN incident was because there was deal made.  </p>

<p>If you wanna read the AG of California&#39;s report on the whole incident its here.</p>

<p><a href="http://ag.ca.gov/cms_attachments/press/pdfs/n1888_acorn_report.pdf">http://ag.ca.gov/cms_attachments/press/pdfs/n1888_acorn_report.pdf</a></p>

<p>It has such comments as</p>

<blockquote>
<p>O’Keefe stated he was out to make a point and to damage ACORN and therefore did not act as a
journalist objectively reporting a story. The video releases were heavily edited to feature only
the worst or most inappropriate statements of the various ACORN employees and to omit some
of the most salient statements by O’Keefe and Giles. Each of the ACORN employees recorded
in California was a low level employee whose job was to help the needy individuals who walked in the door seeking assistance. Giles and O’Keefe lied to engender compassion, but then edited
their statements from the released videos. Would it have been best had each ACORN employee
simply refused to deal with the couple and shown them the door when their story came out? Of
course. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure, but listen to the recordings. There is no context that makes <a href="https://youtu.be/5IuJGHuIkzY?t=829">this</a> innocuous. It&#39;s clear he&#39;s talking about using a mentally ill or willing volunteer to disrupt something. Best case scenario, he&#39;s bullshitting.

    <div class="md"><p>I mean Scott Foval said himself that it was purely hypothetical they were asking him and he kept telling them it was illegal.</p>

<p><a href="http://isthmus.com/news/news/democratic-operative-scott-foval-says-sting-that-brought-him-down-was-a-fraud/">http://isthmus.com/news/news/democratic-operative-scott-foval-says-sting-that-brought-him-down-was-a-fraud/</a></p>

<p>And I can&#39;t listen to the complete recordings, because Veritas hasn&#39;t released anything unedited.  If it was so damning of a conversation why won&#39;t O&#39;Keefe just release the unedited footage and slam the door on people like me questioning him? Why does the footage you linked clip to the middle of a conversation about paying mentally ill people to do stuff?  Maybe the question was literally &quot;hey do you pay mentally ill people to help do shit.&quot; and he just answered in a way that seems suspect given the context of the other shit O&#39;Keefe clipped next to it.  </p>

<p>If O&#39;Keefe was really wanting to show journalism and not just push whatever he decided was his narrative in the video, he would be willing to release unedited footage.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My wife got a pair of paid union protesters arrested once.</p>

<p>It was a man and woman outside a drugstore open during a partial remodel. Apparently, the union had lost the bid for that work.</p>

<p>They were getting in between people and the door and telling them it was &quot;Not safe to go inside.&quot; It was clearly meant to be intimidating/threatening/scary.</p>

<p>As soon as they said that to my wife, she took it seriously. They started stammering about &quot;shoddy workmanship&quot; and &quot;non OSHA illegal labor.&quot;</p>

<p>My wife called the police.</p>

<p>When the police showed up they tried to weasel out of it, claimed they hadn&#39;t said that, etc.</p>

<p>The officer asked a few people exiting the store what was said to them, and upon confirming my wife&#39;s story, arrested the couple.</p>

<p>As they were being cuffed and stuffed, and the pickup they lived out of towed (the store did not allow it to remain in their parking lot), they started whining about how it wasn&#39;t their fault.</p>

<p>They said how they <em>needed</em> the $15/hour they were getting paid, and how they had driven 100 miles to get the job.</p>

<p>The officer pointed out that they should STFU, because they were implicating themselves for more charges. He said they were lucky, he had to cite the protesters they were replacing in the hospital, after they had gotten beaten badly pulling the same bullshit 3 days before.</p>

<p>I felt really bad for the couple, they were broke and desperate, too bad they chose to be paid thugs.</p>

<p>Gettysburg was as devastating and murderous a battle as Waterloo where once again numerous countries were involved. There&#39;s certainly no other &quot;civil wars&quot;, not the English Civil War, or French or American revolutions which were essentially civil conflicts, that even begin to be comparable with the numbers involved in the US Civil War.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually a series of wars, fought and lead by different groups under different leaders against the established order over a fifteen year period. </p>

<p>The periodic loss of power and inevitable fall of Chinese dynasties and the chaos that ensued before another one arose is really another topic in and of itself. </p>

<p>In addition to Mandarin and Cantonese there are over 500 different dialects of Chinese spoken, many of which are completely unintelligible to each other. On the flip side, they all use the same written but not spoken words for the ideographs they use to write and can communicate that way provided that they know how to write. Customs also vary greatly from place to place and they always have. </p>

<p>So it&#39;s a very different kind of a nation or country than most others in that regard and I&#39;m glad you brought it up because it gives me an opportunity to present this very interesting little vid about it&#39;s history. </p>

<p>It&#39;s author is more pessimistic than I am but the warning he gives is well worth watching...

    <div class="md"><p>In terms of combat deaths and casualties in battle I think the Civil War&#39;s numbers were actually much worse. </p>

<p>In terms of death due to starvation and exposure due to the Russian &quot;Scorched Earth&quot; tactics and fierce winter conditions Napoleon&#39;s armies were completely unprepared for, I think it&#39;s fair to say that those more than the few major battles Napoleon fought against the Russian army were what actually destroyed and decimated the large force that he invaded with.</p>

<p>I spent 33 years and four months in active military service and during that period I spent most of my time as a high class muscle man for Big Business, for Wall Street and the bankers. In short, I was a racketeer, a gangster for capitalism. I helped make Mexico and especially Tampico safe for American oil interests in 1914. I helped make Haiti and Cuba a decent place for the National City Bank boys to collect revenues in. I helped in the raping of half a dozen Central American republics for the benefit of Wall Street. I helped purify Nicaragua for the International Banking House of Brown Brothers in 1902–1912. I brought light to the Dominican Republic for the American sugar interests in 1916. I helped make Honduras right for the American fruit companies in 1903. In China in 1927 I helped see to it that Standard Oil went on its way unmolested. Looking back on it, I might have given Al Capone a few hints. The best he could do was to operate his racket in three districts. I operated on three continents.</p>
