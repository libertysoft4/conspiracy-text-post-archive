When high school girls have to accept women with penises in their locker rooms, it does impact those girls and their families.

<p>Can you provide sources for the above cases? I bet for every case you find that supports the above statements I can find at least 10 where the opposite is true. Where transgender teens are constantly bullied to the point of suicide. Cases of gay youth and suicide were quite high not too long ago. Transgender may be sensationalized by MSM but MSM is far from lived experiences of everyday teens struggling with the issues. </p>

<p>This isn&#39;t solely about left/right, democrats/republican politics in America. It is about creating forums where we as people can talk about these issues to arrive at some understanding for the lived experiences of others rather than sweep them under the rug out of fear and ignorance. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Those two things aren&#39;t equal opposites I&#39;m sorry to tell you. Getting bullied and changing your sex to compete with a different gender are not the same.

<p>But white privilege? Go be ANY of those things you mentioned in a non-white country. I&#39;m sorry but white people are the most accepting of all these liberal changes. I think for the most part white people are just done hearing about it. Go fucking do what you need to do and fuck off about it. There is no freer countries in the world than &quot;white&quot; countries. Period. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Did you know causation=correlation? What kind of silly bull is this. I&#39;m sure the fall of Rome had nothing to do with the increasing power of land owners outside of Rome acquiring more power under the increasingly widespread feudal system of production leading to a lessening dependence on Rome; or that increasing temperatures and more advanced farming methods led to a huge population boom in Northern Europe, which was unable to be sustained leading then to pillage (among other things) the southern lands. No I&#39;m sure Rome fell because the people worshiped one god instead of another god.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, not accepting someone is unacceptable. It&#39;s hypocritical but to me, it&#39;s preferable to allowing intolerance of things people can&#39;t change. I can&#39;t change what religion my parents were or the color of my skin, I can change not acting like an asshole to people who come from different backgrounds or don&#39;t believe the same things as me.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a difference between not liking gay people so you don&#39;t associate with them, and parading around with a sign that says &quot;God Hates Fags&quot;</p>

<p>Pointing out hypocrisy is &quot;frightened and triggered?&quot; Both sides are manipulated, but the liberal sockpuppets are a special sort of gullible. </p>
