<p>I don&#39;t know if there&#39;s a device as such, but I&#39;ve been looking into something called &quot;Optogenetics&quot; for the last couple of months and that allows false memories and visual and auditory hallucinations to be caused via light. From my understanding, light is fired into the brain and memory and visualisations can then be manipulated (and if anybody knows this science in more detail and can tell me how I&#39;m misinterpreting the research then please let me know </p>

<p>Regarding research papers, please see some I have linked below on the topic of &quot;optogenetics&quot;. I&#39;ve only linked to research papers or mainstream sources. Bearing in mind that there are no international laws or treatises on bioengineering there&#39;s no legal or ethical obligations for scientists developing this technology to adhere to. Also, the known papers are just what is in the public domain, it could very well be the case that private entities are much further along in their research.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/513681/memory-implants/">https://www.technologyreview.com/s/513681/memory-implants/</a></p>

<p>This article talks about memory implants. From the article (emphasis mine):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Berger and his research partners have yet to conduct human tests of their neural prostheses, but their experiments show how a silicon chip externally connected to rat and monkey brains by electrodes can process information just like actual neurons. <strong>“We’re not putting individual memories back into the brain,” he says. “We’re putting in the capacity to generate memories.”</strong> In an impressive experiment published last fall, Berger and his coworkers demonstrated that they could also help monkeys retrieve long-term memories from a part of the brain that stores them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It can be used to control the brain remotely via light and at the level of individual neurons:</p>

<p><a href="http://spectrum.ieee.org/biomedical/devices/injectable-optoelectronics-for-brain-control">http://spectrum.ieee.org/biomedical/devices/injectable-optoelectronics-for-brain-control</a></p>

<p>It can be used to create advanced visual images in the brain (emphasis mine)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Even when detectable sensations are elicited, reports differ regarding the content of the evoked sensation. <strong>In some studies, patients reported sensations of ‘complex forms’, such as faces or visual scenes from memory</strong> [10,19,29], while in other studies only simple form sensations, such as phosphenes or colour spots, were evoked [18,20,28] (figure 1a). The circuitry of visual areas further downstream may generally support more complex electrical activity patterns that cannot be readily induced by focal electrical stimulation. We discuss in §2b(i) how these differences in evoked percept might arise from anatomical and functional differences between primary and extrastriate visual cortex in both the human and non-human primate brain.</p>
</blockquote>

It seems like it can also manipulate/create auditory hallucinations <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v513/n7517/abs/nature13724.html">http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v513/n7517/abs/nature13724.html</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>These findings provide a synaptic and circuit basis for the motor-related corollary discharge hypothesized to facilitate hearing and auditory-guided behaviours.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not forgetting that scientists can already manipulate memories with it: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2003/dec/04/science.research1">https://www.theguardian.com/science/2003/dec/04/science.research1</a></p>

<p>Tying them all together is that this research is all in mainstream science publications and the Royal Society link above already shows they are experimenting with humans (I believe it was blind people in that case).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Was really young but what I remember was being pulled out of class one day. They took me to a building near the hospital where I met in a small office with a female doctor. She asked if me or my parents had ever had sex with anyone from far South America or had ever visited. My parents are Midwest bible thumpers and I was a virgin so there&#39;s no way it came from them.  To be honest she wouldn&#39;t tell me much and she told me not to tell my parents about it. I can&#39;t recall the name and never got any sort of paperwork regarding it, other than a appointment slip. It was never came up in my army blood tests again. Only when I donated to outside parties. I am STD free as are all my partners. But it&#39;s like a protein marker or something. </p>

<p>Other evidence of me contracting it in the army was all the tests done before recruitment. You have to pass drug tests and blood work, takes weeks. They would have caught it there, if it had been a pre existing condition. But it was caught 3-5 months later, after my basic training and in AIT by the Red Cross. They ran my blood and found it and reported it to the Army. </p>

<p>Seriously though, thanks for sharing.  I&#39;m under no illusions that the government has gotten less sketchy since the 60s and 70s in regards to stuff like this so no one should be too skeptical about your intuitions here.</p>

<p>It might be interesting to try and give blood again, see if they&#39;ll tell you what the marker is so you have a place to start your research.    </p>

They can remotely control brain activity with ELF&#39;s. I once saw a true report (a court case) of some ex military guys who got busted raping a woman using this weapon. They were suppose to be surveilling her, but would use the device on her and enter her house and do whatever they wanted and she would have no memory of it whatsoever. They only way she caught them is she kept noticing weird things, like things out of place or food left on the counter, etc. She set up a surveillance camera and caught them doing it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t have experience related too what you&#39;re talking about, but I&#39;ve read various accounts of things related too your experience. So I&#39;ll share anecdotally what could be true or possible. </p>

<p>You&#39;re a female, young, involved in the military, and worse you have a history of childhood sexual trauma. Involving one parent who molested you and another who blamed you for her spouses actions both parents have a relation to as you describe the bible belt, which could be a possible front for more nefarious activities within your psyche and memory. </p>

<p>Your situation is strange too say the least judging by what you describe and what limits ones imagination but you essentially have a memory of leaving an encaged environment into a bunker(deep underground military base) with many other women where you are all evaluated. None of this you actually remember or believe too be your own memory, and if it&#39;s not your memory it&#39;s of you and is an interpretation of your subconscious from your conscious. </p>

<p>In another comment you mention being pulled out of class which is similar too what&#39;s been reported on the GATE conspiracy involving kids in school being targeted and selected.</p>

<p>You carry a very odd genetic disposition or marker, and you&#39;ve been tested and sampled voluntarily. </p>

<p>I think the military has been done experimenting with people for quite some time now, and your experiences might be more telling of   greater trauma, but regardless trickery is afoot. </p>
