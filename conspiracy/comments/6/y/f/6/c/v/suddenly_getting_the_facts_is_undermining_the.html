<p>Rep. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the panel, said the pair of subpoenas were issued over his objections last month and are designed to &quot;undermine&quot; the claims about the Trump campaign and the Kremlin.</p>

<p>How could the truth undermine his claims unless he knows they are bogus?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How was a non-archive link of CNN allowed? Curious. I thought those were banned.</p>

<p>Anyways, I think OP left out this key detail</p>

<blockquote>
<p>House Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes lashed out at Attorney General Jeff Sessions last week in a letter where he threatened Sessions with a public grilling if he doesn&#39;t produce documents about the Russia dossier to the House intelligence committee.</p>

<p>In the letter, which was <strong>signed only by Nunes and no other members of the House intelligence committee</strong>, Nunes explained that he was extending the deadline for responding to the subpoenas to September 14. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Didn&#39;t Nunes recuse himself after he leaked classified material in broad daylight regarding the committee and now is under a house ethics investigation for that very act?</p>

<p>Also, I would love for Jeff Sessions to testify again in public. Let him tell the public about all of the conversations he had with Kislyak at the Mayflower that he can&#39;t recall. Also would love to hear him testify about his Chief of Staff&#39;s attempts to set up meetings with Kremlin officials.</p>

<p>The Senate Judiciary committee should be voting in the near future on releasing the 10 hr testimony from Glen Simpson. OP will be able to get all the truth he wants from that testimony.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><em>What did he leak?</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Nunes:</strong> So first, I recently confirmed that on numerous occasions, the intelligence community incidentally collected information about U.S. citizens involved in the Trump transition. Details about persons associated with the incoming administration, details with little apparent foreign intelligence value were widely disseminated in intelligence community reporting. Third, I have confirmed that additional names of Trump transition team members were unmasked. And forth and finally, I want to be clear, none of this surveillance was related to Russia, or the investigation of Russian activities, or of the Trump team. </p>

<p><strong>Reporter:</strong> And was the president also part of that incidental collection? </p>

<p><strong>Nunes:</strong> Yes … yes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nunes in broad daylight confirmed that the President of the United States had communications incidentally collected by FISA warrants. I don&#39;t see how that is not leaking classified intelligence. FISA communications are some of the most highly classified intel that the US has.</p>

<p>I also want to put out there that Carter Page, a member of the Trump Campaign&#39;s foreign policy team, was under a FISA warrant during the 2016 campaign because he was recruited as a foreign agent of Russia back in 2013. The FISA intel would have likely come from that warrant.</p>

<p>Yes. Unmasking does not have anything to do with declassifying information to the level that you can disclose to the public. Unless there was a change to the FISA law that I do not know about.</p>

<p>Section 402 requires the DNI to: (1) conduct a declassification review of each decision, order, or opinion issued by the FISA court or the FISA court of review that includes a significant construction or interpretation of any provision of law, including any novel or significant construction or interpretation of &quot;specific selection term&quot; as defined in this Act; and (2) make such decisions, orders, or opinions publicly available to the greatest extent practicable, subject to permissible redactions.</p>

<p>Only the DNI can declassify material from FISA and a public letter must be prepared by the AG. Devin Nunes produced none of these documents when he disclosed the information.</p>
