    <div class="md"><p>Make the case for him to not just be placed at #3 mod, why does he have to lose all his seniority. It would be <a href="/u/axolotl_peyotl">/u/axolotl_peyotl</a> who needs to have admin help because he does not have the sheer number of years <a href="/u/sarah_connor">/u/sarah_connor</a> has in this sub without any record of political fuckery when it comes to   this sub. His track record  <em>does not</em> speak for itself, as it should be for a mod.</p>

<p>I think that it is fair to just put him within 1 minute behind AP of mod seniority. The admins know this can easily be done at the DB level. Just a quiet announcement to the subreddit involved once it is done. Then, AATA can go off and save some other troubled place in the redditsphere.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the case has already been made, but I can explain it all again if you want. He removed ALL of the other moderators! That alone should be enough to lose all mod privileges, not just be placed in #3 spot. If nothing else, it would leave way too much room for more drama in the future if he decided to try removing lower mods again and had to be overridden by the #2 mod. </p>

<p>I agree that I don&#39;t think SC had any history of political fuckery up until this point, which makes this all the weirder. Why come out now and side with DronePuppet (who absolutely should have been removed) and Flytape (who was defending DronePuppet and his actions, and who is incredibly politically biased himself)? That seems like a really unusual side to throw his power behind and a really strange hill to die on. </p>

<p>What&#39;s your case for him being #3? Why not at the very bottom of the list if you insist on keeping him as a mod at all? Then he could still do his mod duties but wouldn&#39;t be able to fuck things up too badly if he wants to try another mutiny. </p>

<p>nothing wrong with just letting the younger guys gain some dirty hands experience inside the queue. then have some of the most senior mods focus on being an effective trainer and helper of the younger upcoming mods. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So it looks wrong? That&#39;s your argument? Well I think it <em>looks wrong</em> for someone who tried to overthrow the moderators in favor of two politically biased trolls to maintain any power in the sub at all. Maybe, MAYBE if things were handled better with some less biased and abusive mods remaining in control after the coup then I could see it.

    <div class="md"><p>I am just trying to be honest. I mean that is always what we say we want, correct? I am just being honest in the sense that SC has always been the top ranked mod here, for as long as I can remember. I would have to boot into my Windows 7 partition  to try to find a screenshot, before now, where SC was <em>NOT</em> the top moderator or right up there. Some of these mods have not even been close to posting the amount of time in this sub that <a href="/u/sarah_connor">/u/sarah_connor</a>  has been moderating here. Having him anywhere on the mod list other than back on the top 3 is just wrong. He should be the #3 mod here...easily, it is still a no-brainer.</p>

<p>SC agreed to do this multiple times and reneged or disappeared each time it actually came down to doing it.  The final time, he said he would agree if JCP was removed from the team.  JCP volunteered to step down, and then SC refused to voluntarily accept a lower position yet again - that&#39;s when the admins stepped in.</p>

<p>Is the AMA worth delving into?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hi u/sudo-tleilaxu. Read this, if you haven&#39;t already. It gives a fairly good overview of what happened over the past 30 days - first the removal of all mod positions, followed up by S_C decimating the mod team. Includes screen shots and links to conversations among the other mods as it all went down.</p>

<p>Full disclosure.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6xy9se/my_name_is_sarah_connor_ama_but_know_youre_fucked/dmkcy6t/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6xy9se/my_name_is_sarah_connor_ama_but_know_youre_fucked/dmkcy6t/</a></p>

<p>Let me know if you have questions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah.  Personally I had very little tolerance for SC&#39;s antics and wanted him and DronePuppet gone from the beginning, but a lot of the other mods were far more understanding than me and gave SC many opportunities to redeem himself.  Even I was in agreement that having SC on the team (just not as top mod) would have been fine.  I wish him well in life but he doesn&#39;t have anyone to blame but himself in this situation as far as I&#39;m concerned.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Could you maybe offer a bit more specifics about DronePuppet&#39;s alts then? The question was mostly ignored in the AMA. I see that there were four known accounts. Can you name them? I know of two (MAGABolt and WarmBacon) but what were the others? And what was his actual justification for it and why were some mods okay with it? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As far as the accounts, I don&#39;t remember the last couple.  I think <a href="/u/Amos_Quito">/u/Amos_Quito</a> might have screenshots saved.  Sorry but I hope you understand that this was about a month ago when this happened and we get dozens if not hundreds of messages per day, I would be scrolling down modmail for the next hour probably.  He also never gave us a full list of his alts though, we only know of the ones we called him out for and yes MAGA + WarmBacon were two of these.  Another one was BuildTheWalle.</p>

<p>He didn&#39;t have a justification for it really.  He offered some half-baked explanation about how he was using them as part of some &quot;experiment&quot; to find political trolls/shills or something - it really made very little sense and he was clearly being defensive and sketchy about it.  It took him almost a week after being accused before he admitted to using the alts at all and then when he did he gave barely any specifics and then totally shut down.  He also claimed that he was working on a &quot;report&quot; where he would reveal his findings, but of course that never happened and hasn&#39;t happened.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know why some mods were okay with it or didn&#39;t immediately call to have him removed from the mod team.  I was one of the more vocal mods because in my opinion it was a blatant abuse of mod powers and I thought he should be removed ASAP.  Some others agreed with me, some defending DP, some were indifferent or wanted to give him a chance to explain his side of things.  I suspect that this might have had something to do with all of the SC drama just because the timing of it was so suspicious, it all seemed to start when we caught DP using the alts.  That&#39;s just speculation on my part though, I have no proof the situations were related.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you! I guess that pretty much answers most of what I was wondering. As much as I&#39;d like a list of all the mods who were okay with this, I know that wouldn&#39;t be appropriate. It just seems like this should have been an issue where everyone was against it, but that&#39;s obviously not the case. And the fact that there are still users who are surprised to learn that MAGABolt = DronePuppet means this might have been buried amongst all of the other drama. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Only one of the mods actually argued in DP&#39;s defense, and he is no longer with the team.  Most of the others either kept silent, were apathetic/indifferent, or basically just said that DP deserved a chance to explain himself and things like that.  Misguided in my opinion considering that he literally was caught using alts to troll his own sub and bait users so he could ban them, but not totally indefensible.</p>

<p>I agree.  That really should be the big take away from all of this as it was (in my opinion) the catalyst for everything.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you read through the various accounts of this drama, SC was giving <em>plenty</em> of time and <em>plenty</em> of warnings to simply demote himself on the team.</p>

<p>Since he had unilaterally neutered the mod team on two different occasions (which prompted admin action) we felt that he was too much of a loose cannon to have at the top of the team.</p>

<p>Naturally, as you rightfully are pointing out, SC has ridiculous seniority here and we absolutely still wanted him on the team. </p>

<p>However, I don&#39;t think it was ever his intention to step down.</p>

<p>After the last drama when he actually removed the mods, we gave him 3 days to step down (but be remodded!)...instead of accepting he wrote several rule-breaking comments (almost seemed on purpose to elicit a response from us).</p>

<p>I removed one particularly egregious comment of his that was attacking a legit user for shilling and working at Eglin air force base.</p>

<p>It was the kind of comment that would earn any other user a warning and potentially a temp ban...again it was so dumb (and uncharacteristic) of SC that I feel like he did it on purpose (after seeing what happened next).</p>

<p>I simply removed his comment, and pleaded with him via modmail to <em>stop</em> attacking users and breaking the rules.</p>

<p>At this point, he announced that because this comment was removed, he was refusing to step down.</p>

<p>Again, I&#39;m not sure how a veteran <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> could <em>possibly</em> think that accusing folks of working at Eglin would be even <em>remotely</em> productive under the circumstances.</p>

<p>The only explanations I can think of are that SC is unstable or SC deliberately baited us to remove his comment so he could use it as an excuse to not step down.</p>

<p>So, put yourself in our position: we had a rogue top mod that was making dangerous unilateral decisions that was rousing the concern of the admins; we voted (in good faith) to simply demote this mod (which he had personally offered months earlier); the mod ignored our vote and made <em>another</em> dangerous decision; we voted <em>again</em> to simply demote the mod; the mod ignored it again and proceeded to unnecessarily rack up several rule violations, meanwhile claiming he wouldn&#39;t be stepping down after all.</p>

<p>It was a volatile and dangerous situation.</p>

<p>All SC had to do was step down voluntarily, get remodded, and <em>much</em> of this drama would&#39;ve been avoided.</p>

<p>He didn&#39;t and it wasnt, and here we are.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, I <em>do</em> respect SC and appreciate his time and dedication to this sub.</p>

<p>However, I hope you consider what I&#39;ve told you here. The <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> mods have enough on our plate as it is, and the last thing we need is to consistently have to fear what a potentially unstable senior mod might do in the spur of the moment.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What do you want to know?</p>

<p>One of the mods discovered that DronePuppet had been secretly making a bunch of accounts approved submitters without them ever asking for it in mod mail or anything.  We started investigating and discovered that these accounts all had similar posting patterns, discussed similar things in a similar tone (lots of political propaganda and trolling/baiting other users), and many of the accounts were no older than a month or two.  We started to suspect that they were DronePuppet&#39;s alts, so we confronted him about it.  He was a ghost for about a week, never responded, and then finally did respond and admitted that they were his alts.  His explanation for why he had them or what he was using them for was barely coherent and he was clearly hostile/defensive at being called out.  He kept saying he was going to produce a &quot;report&quot; of the findings of his &quot;experiment&quot;, but of course no report was ever produced.  He also admitted that he was using the alts to bait users into rule breaking so he could then ban them - a clear abuse of mod powers.  So yeah, that should be the big takeaway from all of this and he certainly needed to go.</p>

<p>Shortly after all of this came to light, SC removed our permissions for the first time.  Personally, I think confronting DP about his alts was the catalyst for everything else that happened but I have no hard proof of that and doubt any will be forthcoming.  Just a gut feeling based on the timing and the way things went down.</p>

<p>How many people use this sub regularly (5+ days per week), consider it an important place for discussion, and care about the moderator dramas?</p>

<p>I would be surprised if this place has even 300 regular users as defined above. It seems to me that most people use this place for light entertainment, and don&#39;t really care.</p>

<p>Kind of like society more broadly. Few people <em>really</em> care.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The politics of this place operate very similarly to the politics of any group of people. A few at the top argue over the deck-chairs, a few in the vicinity argue for a spot on the deck, and the rest simply go about their business, paying attention to whatever amuses them at that moment in time.</p>

<p>Many complain but few care enough to do anything productive or constructive. </p>

If he wanted to still be on the mod team he was given every opportunity as far as I can see, and then burnt that bridge in style.</p>

<p>I&#39;m just sad to see previously valued contributors like yourself getting drawn into worthless mod drama personally. </p>
