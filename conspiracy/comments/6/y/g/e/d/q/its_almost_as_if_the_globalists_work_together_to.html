    <div class="md"><p>Because actual marxism is a relatively coherent ideology that is incompatible with &#39;their&#39; interests. They don&#39;t want us thinking like that.<br/>
And then Cultural marxism is a made up thing that has no meaning. what is it? identity politics? is there an economic policy?<br/>
You&#39;re suggesting that past socialist governments have been brutal and authoritarian. Many marxists would agree.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Personally, I don&#39;t love the term &quot;cultural marxism,&quot; either. Its better to focus on the sorts of policies that they seem to support, in my opinion. This includes mass immigration, globalization, identity politics and censorship in the name of feelings, among others. I actually think these policies are perfectly in line with their interests, especially if they are complicit in the attempt at forming a one world government. I think that Communism is the perfect vehicle for that implementation, but, as usual, I don&#39;t think it would turn out like most supporters of Communism would hope that it would.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sometimes it seems as if everyone here just cannot frame a &quot;default explanation&quot;. Or maybe you do and you just skip over the work of explaining why that default would explain what you are talking about.</p>

<p>The &quot;default explanation&quot; is NOT that globalists take over corporations. </p>

<p>It is that the owners and key managers of large corporations often come from similar backgrounds (like Harvard Business School), and their work requires them to interact with each other and many high-placed non-corporate key players (politicians and non-profiteers), and eventually all these players naturally tend to think and talk and act in similar ways. </p>

<p>Now your job as conspiracy theorist is to show how this &quot;default explanation&quot; - simple, straightforward, logical - cannot be the case.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think your explanation necessarily precludes the OP&#39;s. What you said can be true, and they can also cooperate in anti-competitive ways in order to benefit themselves to the highest possible degree. That would include globalist policies, cheap labor, etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s right. The two versions don&#39;t preclude each other.</p>

<p>But one is clearly a conspiracy, and belongs here. The other one is just some branch of sociology - how do humans naturally behave in given social settings.</p>

<p>I&#39;m just asking everybody to focus on a real conspiracy. Take 9-11. There is a &quot;default explanation&quot; for that phenomenon, but we don&#39;t even have to try to disprove it by now. It&#39;s just a ridiculous claim (by our government) on its face.</p>

<p>I cannot consider the &quot;default explanation&quot; of extreme corporatism, with its many faults, as a ridiculous claim.</p>

<p>Not sure what my other options are...</p>

<p>Just to give some additional context in this dialog, permit me to include a rather long snippet from a post I wrote recently on Postmodernism:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We can all, left and right, see that the end-point of industrialization and computerization is a world in which all the classic economic problems get solved. Who will benefit from that?
The left wants that near-future stage to benefit absolutely everyone in the world. That would mean necessarily breaking down the divisions between the technocratically gifted populations (like white euro males, but also other demographics), and everyone else (like poor brown-skinned people who recently got running water). So their strategy appears to be operating on many levels. Lots of propaganda aimed at leveling the perceptions about the different types of people to make them feel equal; actually encouraging large scale migration so that each country has a mix of people and cannot be homogeneous; large scale infusions of first world capital into the third world areas (by carbon exchange for one thing); efforts to unify economic interchange to facilitate eventual blurring and removal of national boundaries. All these actions are being pushed in postmodern ways.
What does the right want to do? Well I think that&#39;s pretty much up in the air. Mostly, I think the right wants to twist postmodernism into a sort of &quot;magic&quot; that retains the ancient roots of our species&#39; unique abilities. A certain amount of inequality is likely built in to that vision.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Socialism is a wide range of economic and political ideologies. What you&#39;re doing here is equating socialism with Marxism-Leninism, which is a <em>specific ideological implementation</em> of socialism, which for <em>very specific reasons</em> advocated its implementation via a single party revolutionary vanguard and the collectivization of the means of production under a centralized state bureaucracy. </p>

<p>Try opening up a book for once or at the very fucking least the wiki on anarcho-syndicalism and <em>try</em> to tell me how they are even remotely the same fucking thing beyond their support for social ownership of capital. I&#39;m expecting either no response if you have half a brain, or a deluge of fallacious bullshit indicating a complete lack of understanding. </p>

<p>Yeah. Socialism is the democratic control of resources and workplaces by those using them, and AFAIK that has never existed on a national scale.</p>

<p>Fairness ain&#39;t that subjective. Most people agree having some people born into hardship while others are born into lavish luxury and not required to work is pretty unfair.</p>

<p>Yes, the pattern is that dictatorships that use marxist rhetoric are not necessarily socialist. I mean is <strong>D</strong>PRK democratic just because it claims to be?</p>

<p>The funny thing is, &quot;libertarians&quot; have traditionally been socialists and anarchists. I suggest looking into the history of those terms if you wanna be less rampagingly ignorant</p>

<p>That&#39;s not socialism, that&#39;s how liberal democracy works dingus. Name one politician in a liberal capitalist country who didn&#39;t make promises.</p>

<p>how is voluntarily taking a job slavery?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Prisoners and slaves don&#39;t volunteer; wage laborers have no alternative and thus work involuntarily. If the earth was managed as the collective wealth of all mankind and we were all entitled to use it equally, this wouldn&#39;t be a problem. But instead, a ruling class owns all of the resources necessary to sustain life and demand we labor for them to survive.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>how can imperialism be capitalism when it is decided upon by the mafia in DC and halls of power?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because those are the people in power in the capitalist system, and that&#39;s what they&#39;ve been doing for all of modern history.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>i guess you are my problem. I pay taxes to provide you a safety net and to prevent you from being destitute. so you do affect me.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And that safety net is antagonistic and threadbare, it just doesn&#39;t work. Whoop-de-doo, I can get free college tuition. Can I get an affordable place to live, or adequate medical care? Fuck no</p>

<p>Your taxes go to government cronies and blowing up muslims, building society is an afterthought for most of our rulers.</p>

<p>No, I feel I have the right to use unused things, be that vacant land or abandoned material goods. I also think society would be more cohesive and less-resource starved if we recognized that we&#39;re all in this together and shared produce as a matter of course.</p>

<p>Yes, it is. The broken US government is the throne from which capitalism rules the world. Scandinavians aren&#39;t being assholes because they let the US handle that for them, and their rulers aren&#39;t dumb enough to forget the whole &quot;ayy don&#39;t let the proles starve or they&#39;ll eat you&quot; part of liberalism.</p>

<p>That <em>is</em> a voluntary job, but my skills are a little more technical. I&#39;d be more use building electrical systems for buildings, and I&#39;d have a much easier time of that in a cooperative rather than competitive economy. There&#39;s times I just have to sit around all day because the client I&#39;m working for is trying to trump us on the the bill, and my small firm cannot afford pursuing every petty little legal pursuit, especially against a bigger fish with a team of lawyers.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>And is no way to make a living. What you are describing is a way for teenagers to get beer money, not for an adult to sustain themselves. You can&#39;t just start a company and escape poverty or we&#39;d have all done exactly that and the issue would be moot.</p>

<p>Because the framework is not the root cause of the issues! Because the NWO wants us to abandon it! Because it is all the US citizen has going for them these days. Because the framework is the most liberty friendly thing aside from Anarchy, and people will never go for that in mass.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The NWO is happy sidestepping the constitution, why go through the PR hassle with the conservatives when they&#39;ve already shot the thing full of holes anyway?</p>

<p>And the average person is going to have to accept anarchy, because large inexorable market forces are going to collide with technological/political/climate change more and more, and sooner or later large, fractured bureaucracies like the US will shatter. At that point, average people will be faced with the choice between ruling themselves, and being ruled by gangs and/or state remnants. I think they&#39;ll choose anarchy.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>No, resources have nothing to do with wage labor abstractly. It is about employment for pay.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But the reason it&#39;s the sole option is enclosure, the destruction of traditional agrarian life. The overurbanization and atomization of the individual that caused have destroyed society, diluting the very notion of community and replacing the real, extended family with the fragile atomic one. Working land in cooperative, cohesive communities is a common pipedream roun where I&#39;m from.</p>

<p>That&#39;s what 75%+ of this sub thinks. The communist conspiracy has been around for decades. Who says the world is ruled by communism?</p>

<p>There is no &quot;communist conspiracy&quot;, that&#39;s just lingering red scare nonsense. Communists have never projected a genuine international intelligence/military force because they all disagreed too much and got swallowed up by the soviets or americans whenever they actually achieved something.</p>

<p>And you just said the NWO is communist</p>

<p>It was used on a blanket assault on anticapitalists or pretty much anyone else who disagreed with the state.</p>

<p>Great question. I think they want more... like US sovereignty out of the window all together or somehow a one world government out of Jerusalem or London. It seems they economically (and foreign policy) own us already, so anything more they want might be for religious/occult reasons. I have heard &quot;salvation through sin&quot; and &quot;turn the world evil&quot; a bunch, but I don&#39;t know why they need a one world government for that.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Agreed, it seems we are headed for a USD collapse at some point and it could get ugly.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>So they will choose a ruling local miltia/gang rather than state remnants? That sounds kinda reasonable actually.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s not the sole option, just the popular option. Here&#39;s the agrarian lifestyle happily inside of our constitutional republic and other governments too: <a href="http://wwoof.net/">http://wwoof.net/</a></p>

<p>Yes this is true and sad, but I fail to see how the economic concept of capitalism is at fault.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There is no &quot;communist conspiracy&quot;, that&#39;s just lingering red scare nonsense.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The only conspiracy, the Rothschild or London/Rome/DC NWO conspiracy, is widely believed to be pushing communism as a means to establish the NWO. They have to take down US sovereignty to get there. If you believe in the NWO then I can find some sources about NWO and communism.</p>

<p>Why replace DC with london? Sounds like more hassle than it&#39;s worth.</p>

<p>Please. Abrahamic spirituality is a political fairytale meant to keep serfs in line. If that brand of dark magic worked, we&#39;d have warlock&#39;s shops on every street corner.</p>

<p>They will form a militia to repel the gangs and state remnants, and hopefully win enough to form a greater, voluntarily federated society along local democratic lines</p>

<p>wwoof is a friendly fuedalism sim vacation, not a way to rebuild sustainable agrarian communities.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Enclosure forced the vast majority of people into cities and turned the agrarian communities that had previously been the bedrock of society into slave plantations. The harsh, cramped reality of city life encouraged people to plan and look out for smaller family groups, often cut off from the rest of the family by economic migration. The only communal institution that survived the transition to capitalism was the most fucked up and autocratic one, the church.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The only conspiracy, the Rothschild or London/Rome/DC NWO conspiracy, is widely believed to be pushing communism as a means to establish the NWO.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then why push the exact opposite of communism on the world while crushing and slandering any attempts at it for roughly a century?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They have to take down US sovereignty to get there. If you believe in the NWO then I can find some sources about NWO and communism.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why does the NWO have to destroy it&#39;s own seat of power? America is the hegemon ruling the neoliberal order that governs pretty much the whole world outside a few rival power blocs and wacky outliers like Cuba and North Korea.</p>

<p>Yeah maybe you&#39;re right. Maybe it&#39;s more like communists pushing NWO.</p>

<p>So you don&#39;t want a voluntary job but you will go chop trees for timber if they&#39;re public?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That <em>is</em> a voluntary job, but my skills are a little more technical. I&#39;d be more use building electrical systems for buildings, and I&#39;d have a much easier time of that in a cooperative rather than competitive economy. There&#39;s times I just have to sit around all day because the client I&#39;m working for is trying to trump us on the the bill, and my small firm cannot afford pursuing every petty little legal pursuit, especially against a bigger fish with a team of lawyers.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You can start a sole proprietorship for $0 and a few hundred bucks to the city to work in certain industries. For example washing cars in people&#39;s driveways has essentially zero startup costs.</p>

<p>And is no way to make a living. What you are describing is a way for teenagers to get beer money, not for an adult to sustain themselves. You can&#39;t just start a company and escape poverty or we&#39;d have all done exactly that and the issue would be moot.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Please do, reading about that place and looking into it&#39;s philosophical roots while working at one of the corporate hellholes soon set to employ most of us swung me around from &quot;anarcho&quot; capitalist to real anarchist.</p>
