    <div class="md"><p>So they summon hurricanes (how? magic?) to get CNN to run that story and keep the government occupied with it? Because if they didn&#39;t, news would run a story about the cabal instead, and government would find them out? I don&#39;t think the federal investigators like the FBI are any more tied up due to Harvey than they are usually. Seems more like FEMA etc would be busier than normal, but it&#39;s not like they&#39;re the ones doing criminal investigations.</p>

<p>Source? <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Allen">Hurricane Allen</a> had higher windspeeds than Irene and that was in 1980. Irma is in a four-way tie for second place with all the others having happened in the past 100 years.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Harvey">Harvey was only a category 4 hurricane</a>. What about it makes it a &quot;once in a 1000 year hurricane&quot;?</p>

<p>Believe me I&#39;m glad I&#39;m nowhere near either of them, but this isn&#39;t a shockingly unusual thing to have happen.</p>

<p>&quot;There are some reports, for example, that some countries have been trying to construct something like an Ebola Virus, and that would be a very dangerous phenomenon, to say the least. Alvin Toffler has written about this in terms of some scientists in their laboratories trying to devise certain types of pathogens that would be ethnic specific so that they could just eliminate certain ethnic groups and races; and others are designing some sort of engineering, some sort of insects that can destroy specific crops. Others are engaging even in an eco- type of terrorism whereby they can alter the climate, set off earthquakes, volcanoes remotely through the use of electromagnetic waves. &quot;</p>
