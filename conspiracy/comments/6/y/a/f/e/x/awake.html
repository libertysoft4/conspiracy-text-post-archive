I am super paranoid and trust no one outside my circles.  how do i know im not blindly following some narrative and not know it? i watch only chosen tv shows and movies and am not regularly being hypnotized by the boob tube.  that doesnt mean im free n clear.  sometimes i feel like being involved and interested in this sub is a narrative in and of itself.  so, how do i REALLY know if im AWAKE?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>its just so hard to know any thruth when all of my time is spent researching the sources.  there is too much info on any subject to pick out the truths from the half thruths from the lies.  i feel like everyone talks about waking up like a light switch goes off and you finally see the big picture but for me all i see is a bunch of greedy fucks at the top doing thier damndest to stay there and continue to keep making money at the expense of the people.  where aliens, antarctica, war, weather manipulation, god, etc fit in i have no fucking clue.  i feel like i can feel what is wrong all around but i cant clearly see it.  its that whole &quot;gut feeling&quot; thing that everyone is so quick to dismiss but what if that feeling of &quot;something is wrong&quot; is the universe or what ever you want to call it telling us all that we need to do something.  idk just feeling really confused and flooded with info lately and guess i needed to rant haha.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>i just wish i could assemble a consilodated site where everything that has been proven true can go.  i feel like we are wasting time individually seeking the truth when we can help each other build upon knowledge.  there is just too much trust to be had by whoever would assemble this archive that we could never have it lol were all paranoid, i think, naturally.  so how can we ever get past this circular track of sharing info.  we need an official spot, an official voice, by the people for the people.  i wish we could march as a nation to the white house lawn and demand every piece of info on everything with no bs redactions just the ficking tuth for once!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes it&#39;s really quite alot and we humans are preprogrammed to reject it as being crazy. It even explains that in there aswell.. But I do believe there is disinfo in there especially the later parts with the so called reptilian shape shifting.. I don&#39;t buy that at all.. And some other parts to. And I&#39;m sure a site like this couldn&#39;t exist if it weren&#39;t mixing real truth with disinfo </p>

    <div class="md"><p>the thing for me is how its written.  it puts forth all of these crazy idea and tries to make you feel stupid for not believing it.  it uses the very ego it talks about not needing to make tou believe.  it says oh your stupid cuz tour programmed and if you dont believe this your stupid cuz of tour programming.  that basically calls out your ego to say &quot;no im mot stupid&quot; and this makes stupid people just eat it up.  i dont know if im explaining correctly but its hard to put these words down this early in the a.m. lol</p>

    <div class="md"><p>this to me takes away from the facts.  there is too much emotion instead of just presenting me with the info and letting me think it over.  he can make all the same points without attacking the reader.  in fact im sure most people who arent as open minded stopped reading because of all the insults being hurled.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes you&#39;re right about that. Unfortunately I&#39;ve not found a ad free site with this type of pure truth ever in 15 years of being into this stuff, and this site has it all in one place. This site therefore removes alot of troublesome legwork for the reader at the time cost of an obnoxious tone towards said reader. That said I urge everyone to do the legwork anyway, but that might take years to gather information from different times and different parts of the Web in order to paint a full picture of the truth. I&#39;ve done just that and no page to my knowledge breaks it all down like truthism. Even though I personally would have presented it differently. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>thats where im at now.  starting to verify some of this stuff.  im no religous expert or cosmologist but i feel i can at least find things that dont match up.  my biggest question tho is if this is all true, how does this site creator know? where did the concept of square suns come from? if the answer is to be kind to each other and ignore the reptilians it doesnt matter if this is all fake anyway.  thats wat gets me, kust believe, be kind and ignore them.  just seems too easy and too somple of a solution to such a deep and complex issue.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There isn&#39;t any way to verify any of this. It&#39;s about faith, really. What rings true to you. Reading all of the texts on xeeattwelve back in 2008 put me on a spiritual ride that hasn&#39;t ended since, and everything I&#39;ve read after it from Mandela effect to pleiadian channeling to HighLevelInsider, to anonymous, to transhumanism, pedogate, and pretty much everything has been successful in painting a picture that leads me to firm belief what the truth is. Again it&#39;s about faith and there is no way of verifying its true by any sort of quantifiable evidence. This is all metaphysical stuff and esoteric in nature. At the very core, it&#39;s spiritual. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It will take alot of time to be able to trace back to who wrote what and what lead people to making certain connections. There isn&#39;t any simple answer. Noone can give you an answer you&#39;re gonna have to find it yourself. I know that&#39;s not what you want to hear but the only way you&#39;ll ever get that eureka feeling is from you yourself doing alot of studying. Maybe in 10 years you will also be able to go back to truthism and think &quot;man, this really is everything&quot;. Or, not. You&#39;re gonna have to start somewhere though so start with what strikes you as most fascinating then devote a few weeks to research just that, then move on. This is the only way you&#39;ll find answers </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I completely understand. I&#39;m just saying that for me, doing this for almost 20 years, well i really begun when 911 happened - everything I&#39;ve learned, I have found that truthism condenses it all into one place. I realise that starting with truthism might not be a good idea but at the very least you can use it as a blueprint and then go and do research of everything you find even remotely interesting. From there you can then make up your mind what you think the truth is. Make a checklist and tick one thing off at a time. Regarding what the answer to all of this is, or what the point to it is, I don&#39;t know. And I don&#39;t really care either to be honest. I&#39;m not looking for any solutions, all I want is the truth. And seing what type of person you are I would strongly recommend you doing all of the legwork yourself. It&#39;s gonna take alot of book reading and text reading but it&#39;s gonna be worth it. And you&#39;re gonna have to sift thru alot of bullshit to get there, but you strike me as the type of person who needs to do this in order to believe anything. So that&#39;s what I recommend. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>thats what i mean.  how do i know what the truth is on any given topic when there are articles and sources stating two completely different things? it happens all the time then it comes down to a debate about sources but unless your very intimate with all of the info its so easy to get sodetracked or follow the wrong thing.<br/>
Also you say that &quot;real conspiracies&quot; are posted and that the conspiritors receal themselves.  HOW DO YOU KNOW?   When someone just disagrees with something all a sudden they are evil shills.  But the truth is there is so little we KNOW that it makes seeking more knowledge that much harder because the msm and the like bury it in a mountain of dis info and propaganda.  so really what is a sure fire way to know the info you recieve is legit? how can i know that a conspiracy im reading about was ever a conspiracy in the first place? does it not make sense for people who are in on it to flood the area with false narratives? some people can argue anything and have proofs but still be wrong.  so again, how can we streamline info that is true whilst simultaneously squashing lies? and we cant just identify what is tuth and what isnt we would need to share how thise conclusions were made so people can see the transparancy.  but sonce there is no such process its all fuckery</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are still differences in the parties but the people who took control of the Democratic Party in the late 80s and early 90s did bring them closer on some issues. </p>

<p>And there are differences between a conservative government and a liberal or democratic socialist government. </p>

<p>However conservatives have controlled the narrative and dialog in this nation since the Nixon administration and to an extreme level since the 1980s. That followed by a real push for very deliberate confusion about the definition and use of the words, liberal conservative and the addition into the political dialog of the word progressive.  It would take a book to untangle the destruction of the political discussion in our nation especially for anyone under 30. 
No one knows what any of the words and phrases mean from one generation to the next. </p>

<p>and so is Donald Trump  an avowed extreme conservative advocate of an oppressive oligarch controlled police state.</p>

<p>Turn inward, and try out meditation.  Literally just sitting with as blank a mind as possible.  Maybe the interweb has a better explanation of &quot;how&quot; but sitting silent for 20-30 minutes is basically it.  Find truths that are not narrative based.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>thats where im at now.  starting to verify some of this stuff.  im no religous expert or cosmologist but i feel i can at least find things that dont match up.  my biggest question tho is if this is all true, how does this site creator know? where did the concept of square suns come from? if the answer is to be kind to each other and ignore the reptilians it doesnt matter if this is all fake anyway.  thats wat gets me, kust believe, be kind and ignore them.  just seems too easy and too somple of a solution to such a deep and complex issue.</p>
