<p>So for the past year or so I was convinced I was depressed. College-student who switched majors 3 times, kind of enjoying what I&#39;m doing now, but still not a &quot;spark&quot;. Anywayy...</p>

<p>How do you people deal with this society? I&#39;m currently going down the drain, school, relationships, happiness, bank account, everything. I&#39;m convinced it&#39;s not depression because I&#39;m not sad, I&#39;m just unmotivated. I feel like all I have to look forward to is 10 years of paying off debt, 45 years in the work force working for some scumbag so I can [hopefully] fund a retirement one day; one of which I&#39;ll probably be too old and crippled to even enjoy.</p>

<p>I just can&#39;t seem to get my head right. Everytime I get my ass to work, or go to school I can&#39;t help but think everything I&#39;m doing is a waste of this miracle we call life. I mean shit, TRILLIONS OF FUCKING GALAXIES and I&#39;m sitting in a classroom learning shit, or sitting at work getting treated like dirt for $9 which isn&#39;t even remotely enough to pay for my expenses. </p>

<p>How do you get yourself to ignore the fact that every single one of us is wasting this gift of life?</p>

<p>Edit:  wow this blew up, at least I know I&#39;m not the only one! I still get my shit done but it gets harder everyday! </p>

<p>Here&#39;s what I&#39;m listening to see if it helps yall!~ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMuzFQTpjDE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMuzFQTpjDE</a> ~</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly! I always ask that question: &quot;where have all our heroes gone&quot;?!? We have none! Everything is corrupted, we had a May Day march here in Portland today and it was canceled because the anarchists took it over and they shut it down. </p>

<p>The way society is makes me want to be less and less a part of it. Where&#39;s everyone&#39;s awareness? I feel like everyone is taking crazy pills, and us select few are immune to them...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>36 I think trying to figure this shit out. I used to be a lot more motivated 8 years ago but now I see all the bullshit in front of me and am stepping high. I try to get my adrenaline cranked up on weekends but they just fly fucking by and I feel a little wore out and miss it bad on Mondays. Hell Mondays at 2AM I lay awake dreading what I gotta do. It really isn&#39;t the job but it&#39;s looking down at it from 30,000 feet on my back in my bed that is crushing. </p>

<p>It is because we are all woke as fuck but still cornered somehow looking for a way over the wet paint. I might just gotta stomp through that shit and look back way on down the road. </p>

<p>I often wonder if I can change the whole spectrum of our collective feelings just by making that brave jump for us all/myself. </p>

<p>If I didn&#39;t have an 9 year old it would be a lot easier of decision for sure. </p>
