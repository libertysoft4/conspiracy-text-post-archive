<p>Epstein also sexually trafficked the then-minor Jane Doe, making her available for sex to politically-connected and financially-powerful people.

    <div class="md"><p>Do you have a source for this? I&#39;m trying to find a court filing I&#39;ve read previously that mentioned Donald Trump but from what I can recall, Trump was never implicated as being part of it... He was mentioned in the filing as being present at Maralago when Epstein and Derschowitz were with the young girls and that he banned from Epstein from coming back after he tried to make a move on one of Trump&#39;s friends. It was also mentioned that Trump had several numbers listed in Epstein&#39;s blackbook and for these reasons, the Plaintiff&#39;s attorneys believed he should be called as a witness to testify, but they never made any allegations implicating Trump in the acts themselves. I&#39;ve also seen a filing from last year claiming that Trump and Epstein had both raped minors but that was voluntarily withdrawn/dismissed in September 2016. The only evidence that was presented as proof for these claims were 2 affidavits from the alleged victims. Not saying they&#39;re not telling the truth, but if the only thing they have as proof is the affidavits of victims, there&#39;s not much grounds to prove their claims. </p>

<p>Let me be clear though, I&#39;m not dismissing the possibility of Trump actually being involved in this, but it&#39;s going to take a little bit more evidence to convince me that he was. The seriousness of the allegations and the timing that of the filings against Trump seem as if they could have been politically motivated, but again, I&#39;m not saying that they&#39;re entirely fabricated or unlikely. We just need more proof to make a real determination </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Since this was a lawsuit against the US Government in 2014, I am wondering if OP has researched what the latest update was on the case. Has anyone been convicted or was it thrown out for lack of evidence or something </p>

    <p class="byline text-muted mb-0"><a href="javascript:;" class="score"><span class="badge badge-secondary">n/a</span></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/okokok7654.html">okokok7654</a> 2017-05-02</p>
    <div class="md"><p>I just looked at the case on PACER&#39;s website and the last thing that was filed was in September 2016, and it was an Order Granting Petitioner&#39;s Motion to Temporarily Seal Reply in Support of Motion to Compel... The order says that the Reply to the Motion to Compel should be placed under seal until any further order of the court. There are no scheduled hearings, but from what I can tell, the case is still open and waiting a response/decision from the judge. I could be misinterpreting this order but that&#39;s what I gathered from it. </p>

<p>The case isn&#39;t trying to determine whether someone should be convicted, and unfortunately I can&#39;t afford to view or download all of the documents from the case (it costs 10 cents per page just to view each filing and there&#39;s thousands of pages), but this case was initiated by Jane Doe #1 and Jane Doe #2 in 2008 because they believed their rights were not protected under the CVRA (Crime Victims Rights Acts). Attorneys in the first filing claimed that the first to JDoe&#39;s weren&#39;t contacted about the plea deal, etc. That&#39;s why its against the US Government. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Since everyone seems to be missing the forest for the trees, here is the real question:</p>

<p>What are the odds that a pedo-blackmail billionaire has a relationship with the 2 presidential nominee ticket winners of 2016, over 15 years before the election, but does not have any relationship with any other primary candidate?</p>

<p>Myopic researchers will focus on Trump or Clinton or Epstein.  It doesn&#39;t matter if sex happened.  There&#39;s already a blackmail leverage &quot;grey zone&quot; established by the fact of any relationship with a pedophile (even if Epstein is not accurately or technically a pedophile).</p>

<p>So the real question is:  What are the odds?  If the odds are too coincidental, then was Epstein a planned blackmail operation to control an election or a president (or more)?  15 years in advance?  By whom?  Is there simply a state-sponsor?  But if it was only a state-sponsor, then how far in advance are elections fixed, and how widely known would that have to be?</p>

<p>Reddit intel agent infiltrators will tell us it&#39;s only a coincidence:  &quot;Epstein hangs out with powerful people.  Trump &amp; Clinton were powerful.  Sanders, Cruz, Rubio, Webb, Carson were not powerful&quot;.  And the Bushes are &quot;just too clean&quot;.  How convenient.</p>

<p>Epstein smacks of an intelligence operation.  So the important details are not inside the Epstein-Trump-Clinton relationship.  The important details are external.  Who is Epstein?  What relationships does he have with intelligence agencies?  Does Epstein have a handler?  Does Epstein have relationships with others who have ties to intelligence agencies?  Is it not a single agency behind Epstein?  Is it a <a href="http://www.historycommons.org/entity.jsp?entity=safari_club_1">Safari Club</a>?  Why would the CIA family Bush be &quot;just too clean&quot; or &quot;just not right for 2016&quot; to be having a relationship with Epstein?  What ties does Epstein have to Mossad?  Will there be a Russian tie to blame it all on Putin?  If not, why not?  What would that tell us?</p>
