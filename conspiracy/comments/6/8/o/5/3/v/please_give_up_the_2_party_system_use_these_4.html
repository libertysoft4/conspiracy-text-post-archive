    <div class="md"><p>No, you are historically correct. Republicans often talk about medicare, but not so much since obamacare became a hot topic that encompasses it. It is easier to go after that since it affects more people.</p>

<p>The important part to remember though, is that these parties only pay lip service to these issues, and don&#39;t actually want to fix them. They want people to be dependant on them for these issues, and fixing them rarely works to that end. </p>

<p>For instance democrats will raise welfare entitlement rather than try to get people less dependent on welfare. This give voters the idea they care about the issue, but really they are just making voters dependant on them for future welfare entitlements.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes it does matter. Its cause and effect. Theres a reason things happen. In your fantasy world where people just become poor for no reason at all, maybe all poor are the same. Theres a large portion of our country that is abusing welfare systems and has no desire to be productive members of society. Hell I can show you proof just meet some old highschool shit heads I know.  There is a difference.</p>

<p>Opportunity is out there but it takes motivation to seek. Alot of people dont want to seek it. Alot of people simply dont want to work. Go volunteer at a homeless shelter then come back and tell me about your opinion again.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, it is. I love that your post is angry and has no substance. It was discussed in the Federalist papers by James Madison, but he later abandoned that philosophy and joined with Jefferson to form an opposition party.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/willard-sterne-randall/founding-fathers-political-parties_b_1843593.html">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/willard-sterne-randall/founding-fathers-political-parties_b_1843593.html</a></p>

<p>John Adams said:</p>

<p>There is nothing which I dread so much as a division of the republic into two great parties, each arranged under its leader, and concerting measures in opposition to each other. This, in my humble apprehension, is to be dreaded as the greatest political evil under our Constitution.</p>

<p>George Washington agreed, saying in his farewell presidential speech:</p>

<p>The alternate domination of one faction over another, sharpened by the spirit of revenge, natural to party dissension, which in different ages and countries has perpetrated the most horrid enormities, is itself a frightful despotism. But this leads at length to a more formal and permanent despotism. The disorders and miseries, which result, gradually incline the minds of men to seek security and repose in the absolute power of an individual; and sooner or later the chief of some prevailing faction, more able or more fortunate than his competitors, turns this disposition to the purposes of his own elevation, on the ruins of Public Liberty</p>

<p>Without looking forward to an extremity of this kind, (which nevertheless ought not to be entirely out of sight,) the common and continual mischiefs of the spirit of party are sufficient to make it the interest and duty of a wise people to discourage and restrain it.</p>

<p>It serves always to distract the Public Councils, and enfeeble the Public Administration. It agitates the Community with ill-founded jealousies and false alarms; kindles the animosity of one part against another, foments occasionally riot and insurrection. It opens the door to foreign influence and corruption, which find a facilitated access to the government itself through the channels of party passions. Thus the policy and the will of one country are subjected to the policy and will of another.</p>

<p>There is an opinion, that parties in free countries are useful checks upon the administration of the Government, and serve to keep alive the spirit of Liberty. This within certain limits is probably true; and in Governments of a Monarchical cast, Patriotism may look with indulgence, if not with favor, upon the spirit of party. But in those of the popular character, in Governments purely elective, it is a spirit not to be encouraged. From their natural tendency, it is certain there will always be enough of that spirit for every salutary purpose. And, there being constant danger of excess, the effort ought to be, by force of public opinion, to mitigate and assuage it. A fire not to be quenched, it demands a uniform vigilance to prevent its bursting into a flame, lest, instead of warming, it should consume.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Read Federalist 10, among others. Instead of spending time trying to reinforce what you think you know, learn something. Again, this is a subject written of extensively in the Federalist Papers, the anti-Federalist Papers, and the secret minutes of the Constitutional Convention.</p>

<p>The proposition is that the two party system is a byproduct of our political system.</p>

<p>Your counter proposition is that it is not.</p>

<p>My counter proposition is read the writings of the Founding Fathers who wrote all about faction and how our system of government would lead to a two party system. </p>

<p>Your counter proposition is to post quotes from the Founding Fathers that prove how our system of government would lead to faction and a two party system? <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2011/07/the-founding-fathers-tried-to-warn-us-about-the-threat-from-a-two-party-system.html">This</a> is where you got those quotes. The headline reads, &quot;The Founding Fathers Tried to Warn Us About the Threat From a Two-Party System.&quot; So, why are you using those quotes to tell me <em>I</em> am wrong?</p>

<p>If you actually had a hint of intellect or had actually read the quotes you just posted, if you had any context with which to understand any of these things, then you would understand why the quotes you just posted prove my point. If you had actually read the writings of the Founding Fathers you would understand all of this. Instead you did a Google search and copied and pasted the first things that you could find, stupidly believing they supported your argument, when in fact they support mine. Instead of trying to reinforce your worldview, try learning.</p>

<p>&quot;By a faction, I understand a number of citizens, whether amounting to a majority or a minority of the whole, who are united and actuated by some common impulse of passion, or of interest, adversed to the rights of other citizens, or to the permanent and aggregate interests of the community.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The latent causes of faction are thus sown in the nature of man; and we see them everywhere brought into different degrees of activity, according to the different circumstances of civil society. A zeal for different opinions concerning religion, concerning government, and many other points, as well of speculation as of practice; an attachment to different leaders ambitiously contending for pre-eminence and power; or to persons of other descriptions whose fortunes have been interesting to the human passions, have, in turn, divided mankind into parties, inflamed them with mutual animosity, and rendered them much more disposed to vex and oppress each other than to co-operate for their common good. So strong is this propensity of mankind to fall into mutual animosities, that where no substantial occasion presents itself, the most frivolous and fanciful distinctions have been sufficient to kindle their unfriendly passions and excite their most violent conflicts. But the most common and durable source of factions has been the various and unequal distribution of property. <strong>Those who hold and those who are without property have ever formed distinct interests in society.</strong> Those who are creditors, and those who are debtors, fall under a like discrimination. <strong>A landed interest, a manufacturing interest, a mercantile interest, a moneyed interest, with many lesser interests, grow up of necessity in civilized nations, and divide them into different classes, actuated by different sentiments and views.</strong> The regulation of these various and interfering interests forms the principal task of modern legislation, and involves the spirit of party and faction in the necessary and ordinary operations of the government.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<strong>If a faction consists of less than a majority, relief is supplied by the republican principle, which enables the majority to defeat its sinister views by regular vote. It may clog the administration, it may convulse the society; but it will be unable to execute and mask its violence under the forms of the Constitution. When a majority is included in a faction, the form of popular government, on the other hand, enables it to sacrifice to its ruling passion or interest both the public good and the rights of other citizens.</strong> To secure the public good and private rights against the danger of such a faction, and at the same time to preserve the spirit and the form of popular government, is then the great object to which our inquiries are directed. Let me add that it is the great desideratum by which this form of government can be rescued from the opprobrium under which it has so long labored, and be recommended to the esteem and adoption of mankind.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;By what means is this object attainable? Evidently by one of two only. Either the existence of the same passion or interest in a majority at the same time must be prevented, or the majority, having such coexistent passion or interest, must be rendered, by their number and local situation, unable to concert and carry into effect schemes of oppression. If the impulse and the opportunity be suffered to coincide, we well know that neither moral nor religious motives can be relied on as an adequate control. They are not found to be such on the injustice and violence of individuals, and lose their efficacy in proportion to the number combined together, that is, in proportion as their efficacy becomes needful.</p>

<p>The president can&#39;t actually do that. Congress has to pass legislation to do that.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Again, sounds suspiciously like the Democrats. As much as he could, spending the political capital he had available, Obama pulled the federal government back from imposing on states that wanted to decriminalize. Then again, it wasn&#39;t always up to his decision. Just look at what happened when DC tried to decriminalize.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There&#39;s about 4 actually progressive democrats.. they aren&#39;t doing shit.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What do you expect them to do? There is a process by which votes are counted for legislation. The Republicans have already voted on DC&#39;s marijuana policy. It&#39;s not exactly difficult to guess where they would vote in regards to federal law.</p>

<p>All we have to do is start early. Our backup plan can be the democrats, but don&#39;t donate or volunteer for the Democratic Party who will waste 2+ years of your life when they cheat you.</p>

<p>The reason Stein didn&#39;t get into the debates is because we wasted our time with Bernie through the Democratic Party. Let&#39;s not make that mistake again. And if Democrats really fear Trump as much as they say they do they will join us to defeat him.</p>

<p>I know. We didn&#39;t have to have Trump if Democrats actually held their party, candidates, and leadership accountable. Instead DWS was not held accountable at all. She was literally praised and offered a job by Clinton directly after stepping down <a href="https://www.hillaryclinton.com/briefing/statements/2016/07/24/hillary-clinton-statement-on-the-resignation-of-democratic-national-committee-chair-debbie-wasserman-schultz/">https://www.hillaryclinton.com/briefing/statements/2016/07/24/hillary-clinton-statement-on-the-resignation-of-democratic-national-committee-chair-debbie-wasserman-schultz/</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Screw that noise, I&#39;ve already founded and begun funding a PAC to oust Republicans - who I consider to be basically the Devil - the Democratic party presents the most likely option for that. Attempting to divert likely Democratic voters to third parties is the sort of insanity only someone who wants the Republican party to thrive would advocate - which is, also why I&#39;m thinking I&#39;ll start a &quot;Republicans should vote Libertarian!&quot; Super PAC, while I&#39;m at it. I&#39;ve got ideas for campaigns designed to drive likely voters into the Democratic fold, drive Republican diehards third party, and discourage Democratic voters from considering third party candidates. Hell, I&#39;ve already begun spending <em>against</em> the Green Party.</p>

<p>We&#39;ll get viable third parties once one of the major parties is toast - for a time, at least, until one supplants the faded major party - and I choose the Republicans to go the way of the dodo, personally. Our political system is a two party system, though, at its core.</p>
