        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>First lets start with Robbie Parker. Father of Emily Parker who died at Sandy Hook according to official reports. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVbwG8_qloA">Here</a> Robbie Parker can be seen displaying some rather odd behavior before a press conference shortly following the events of Sandy Hook. He is seen laughing and smiling, seemingly unaware that the cameras are already rolling. He also mumbles something fairly inaudible but some believe he says &quot;I feel terrible supporting this&quot;. </p>

<p>He then takes a brief moment to (what it appears to look like) &quot;get into character&quot;, before beginning to discuss the horrific details of his daughters death. In my opinion, it also seems as though he is trying not to smile during his time on camera. </p>

<p>Whether or not Sandy Hook was a hoax, Robbie Parker&#39;s behavior following the murder of his daughter is definitely odd.</p>

<p>Below are four articles from the Newtown Bee and  that shine light on the state of the Sandy Hook Elementary School building in years prior to the attack. </p>

<p><a href="https://newtownbee.com/school-air-quality-upgrades-may-cost-29-5-million/">This</a> article from 2002, states that the Consulting Engineering Services recommended to the school district that SHES be “worked on in 2010 over a nine-month period” to upgrade and renovate its heating and ventilation system at a cost of $4.5 million.</p>

<p><a href="https://newtownbee.com/the-spirit-of-young-bob-johnson-and-chris-chemero-in-cleaning-up-edmond-town-hall-is-exactly-what-the-newtown-beautification-committee-and-richard-f-howe-are-looking-for-during-cleanup-week-april-21/">This</a> article from 2004 states that Newtown Public Building Committee told their Board of Education that “there were serious problems with the Sandy Hook elementary school roof.” </p>

<p><a href="https://newtownbee.com/44619/">This</a> article sheds light on the fact that Sandy Hook may have been contaminated with asbestos. Only to be confirmed by the article below. </p>

<p><a href="https://newtownbee.com/widespread-haz-mat-presence-would-have-hampered-sandy-hook-renovations/">This</a> article confirms that Sandy Hook was indeed infested with asbestos. Newtown’s Public Building and Site Commission Chairman Robert Mitchell issued a report to justify the <strong>already-approved</strong> demolition. He said that “had the town decided to reoccupy the school on Dickinson Drive, it would have faced a daunting and possibly insurmountable challenge regarding the presence of hazardous materials” because the school was contaminated by not just asbestos, but also PCBs under the flooring and in the foundations and footings.</p>

<p><a href="http://schoolconstructionnews.com/2013/10/15/newton-voters-approve-49-million-sandy-hook-project/">Here</a> we can see that Newtown received a 49.2 million dollar grant from the state to rebuild the school.</p>

<p>The above articles support the claim that Sandy Hook closed in 2008. This claim has been made by multiple Newtown residents. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrHD-mELhcs#t=50m00s">Here</a> you can hear Dan Bidondi talk more about this.</p>

<p>If you check the internet activity for the official Sandy Hook Elementary School website (<a href="http://newtown.k12.ct.us/%7Esh">http://newtown.k12.ct.us/~sh</a>),
(Which has since been taken down and replaced with a new one), you will notice that there was virtually no internet activity between 2008-2012. Using the Wayback Machine we can trace the internet activity: <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://newtown.k12.ct.us/%7Esh">http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://newtown.k12.ct.us/~sh</a></p>

<p>As you can see the activity spikes again after the shooting. This obviously further supports the argument that the school was closed. </p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJm96s-Dxyw">this</a> video you can briefly see a picture of Sandy Hook victim Noah Pozner in the background of a news report in Pakistan on a massacre of 152 people by the Taliban in 2014. Eyebrow raising to say the least. Weren&#39;t we told that Noah Pozner died in 2012 from 11 gunshot wounds? <a href="https://www.thestar.com/opinion/editorialopinion/2013/01/22/mallick_why_newtown_victim_noah_pozner_had_an_open_coffin.html">One of which literally blew off his entire jaw?</a></p>

<p>Lenny Pozner, father of Noah Pozner, also happens to be the <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/honrlegalfund">HONR network owner.</a> An organization which specializes in getting videos and information removed from the internet.</p>

<p>I will post more later, but I have to go to work for now. There is plenty more to share regarding crisis actors, blatant lies and changes in story, money changing hands, legislation passed, and much much more.</p>

<p>Let me stop you right here crazy brah. The massacre in Pakistan took place in Peshawar. It&#39;s in a province that is dominantly made up of Pashtun people. Their ethnic origin is dubious, but most suspect they are a germanic people. <a href="http://i84.servimg.com/u/f84/11/44/76/87/afghan10.jpg">This means many of them have blond or brown hair, white skin, and even blue eyes. like this:</a></p>

<p>So this is less a conspiracy theory, and more your ignorance on the matter, where you thought all &quot;brown people&quot; look like aladdin or some god damned white bullshit stereotype.</p>
