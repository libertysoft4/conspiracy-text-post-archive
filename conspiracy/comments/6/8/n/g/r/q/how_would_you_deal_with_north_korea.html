<p>We have to modernize our Cyber Warfare Capabilities and continue to cause damage to their systems. </p>

<p>Secondly, China can no longer be a supplier of goods to North Korea, point blank. China cannot dump the US dollar although they own 1 trillion of our debt, because they would collapse their biggest consumer. If China wants to continue economic growth they must comply for our demands of alienating the rogue state completely.</p>

<p>Leaving 2 choices for North Korea, they dump their Nuclear program or start a conventional war.</p>

<p>Yes, South Korea is at risk but the logistics of preparation by North Korea would be noticeable and the Pacific Fleet can devastate them in minutes.</p>

<p>Strangle China, and you forcr North Korea to either comply or starve. People revolt when face with starvation, look at Venezuela. It is at the brink of complete civil war. </p>

<p>So your plan is to try and blackmail a nuclear power with the &quot;threat&quot; that if they shit on our currency catastrophically, it will cause lesser harm to them?  You realize China has been pushing jato SEA and South/Central America for the purpose of defusing that, right?  If the US dollar crashed AND we lost our major supplier for cheap consumer tech there would be people frothing in the streets (more than they are now).</p>

Hell, half of the human rights violations claims in NK are exacerbated by the fact that their ability to trade has been cut to effectively nil.</p>

<p>I find it hilarious that half of the people here go on and on about &quot;globalists&quot;, yet people will also advocate for the US doing what it does worst: go into a foreign nation, act like police, and leave the country completely fucked afterwards.

    <div class="md"><p>That leads us to muddy waters though, Russia has been very adamant that ABM systems by the US have shifted the paradigm of Mutual Destruction and are a coy by the US to render Russia nuclear power obsolete. Just paraphrasing, but such a scenario of more systems in the Korean peninsula coupled with NATO pushing closer to Russian borders might likely trigger an aggressive Russian response. </p>

<p>Russia has publicly stated that the US is looking to encircle them and they have fantastic intelligence capabilities so if we continue to use North Korea as a means to set up and activate a defense shield around Russia, they will fire I believe. </p>
