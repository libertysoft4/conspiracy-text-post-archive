Now I already know I&#39;m gonna get a lot of hate, downvotes and r/shittyconspiracy blah blah blah for this post so bring it. This is just a thought, and personally I haven&#39;t decided what side of the fence I&#39;m on with the Mandella Effect even though it&#39;s kinda creepy.

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. </p>

<p>The human brain is a recorder. We assess information and absorb it in this stage of development. The theory of the multiverse is only a theory and a widely argued one at that. </p>

<p>The kid recites information he was told and the adult in the video coerces specific channels of information each tine the childs mind is sidetracked. This is a long term system of abuse on the child. </p>

<p>The size of infinity is not measurable, therefore his definition is irrelevant.  Its hypothetical arguments proposed by the leading names in physics. Yet these are not in any way unknown or revolutionary concepts. </p>

<p>This is the work of a rather smart adult male encouraging and influencing a young child to see &#39;differences&#39; in two realitys that are one in the same. Information is stored in matter. So if our universe &#39;ended&#39; the matter does not transition. It dies too. </p>

<p>This is why you can not recover a harddrive once its been damaged. </p>

<p>Noting also cern is only a haldron collider. They are soecifically farming antimatter with the devices. As there are 13 of them by my last count. You only need 1 if the basis of reasoning was to simply &#39;test the big bang&#39; via atomic bombardments of atom on atom near light speed collisions. </p>

<p>Its the discovery and collection of exotic and rare elements which keeps the government interested in their building more and more (larger) colliders. </p>

<p>Note also antimatter engines were designed years ago and our aspirations for long diatance space travel are humanity&#39;s next truly unknown frontier. </p>

<p>Are you out to lunch? Do you think Einstein was inventing his (flawed) theories when he was a kid? No, he was an old man who had time to make it through academia. Theories invented before academia are absolutely useless as anyone who goes through that drivel will soon realize there is far more overhead conforming to the community than deriving original work, hence anything created before entering the community would not be aware of how to write a paper that actually means anything or can convince anyone of a single thing. </p>

<p>If people want to watch the videos, and the parents genuinely feel like they have a kid they don&#39;t understand and perhaps the world at large could benefit from, are you shocked they are taking a video of it? </p>

<p>Based on what you just said here: </p>

<blockquote>

<p>It sounds like you understand FAR less about infinities than this 13-year old. Do you even know who George Cantor is? Comparing infinities to each other is a long-studied mathematical practice and you think... it doesn&#39;t exist? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What I think is your one of the kids parents- or just as well equal to their failed interpretations of what makes a genius.</p>

<p>Einstein was a mathmatical genius using his skillset to explore the very algebra expressions utilized to discover patents. He already mastered basic mathematical expressions at an early age. So he was far more capable if expressing his work then you give him credit for. </p>

<p>You undersell actual work ethic to promote a  child who has no grasp on basic calculus- So its obvious your either being intentually naive and sadistic or simply are just that. </p>

<p>I am well aware about the practical use of infinity. (as well as the symbol for its use); Ive just never seen it regurgitated by a minor thats suffering from child abuse live on youtube. </p>

<p>You have no explaination for your actions. This is called &#39;damage control&#39; or &#39;brain damage&#39;. Citing physicists as though your aware makes me feel you personally nurture this childs development. Its appauling-</p>

<p>I know einstein was a genius because its proven that his theories were his own. </p>

<p>This is a child pre programmed to recite exotic principals in a dangerous manner-</p>

<p>There is no telling how severely affected he will become as his &#39;genius&#39; is picked apart revealing a sad mislead child whose parents filled his head with wild ideas and delusions of grandeur-</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Einstein was not an obvious genius from an early age, he got good marks generally but was not producing <strong>anything</strong> approaching meaningful work until he was 21 at least. This kid still has 8 years to go before he is where Einstein was just starting. His 4 famous papers came when he was 26, so this kid is just half the age Einstein was. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Was he a bad student? He started school at 6½ and, according to an Albert Einstein Archives biography, his early teachers did not find him especially talented even though  he got high marks. He hated the strict protocols  followed by teachers and rote learning demanded of students, which explains his disdain for school, which he carried with him when, at age 9½, he entered the Luitpold Gymnasium, a competitive school. He liked some subjects better than others but progressed through school, again earning high marks. By age 11, he was reading college physics books, and at 13 he decided that Kant was his favorite author after reading the “Critique of Pure Reason.” He was clearly brilliant to anybody paying attention.</p>

<p>Did he flunk math? He did fine in math, but he did flunk the entrance exam to the Zurich Polytechnic when he first took it — when he was about 1 1/2 years away from graduating high school, at age 16, and hadn’t had a lot of French, the language in which the exam was given. He did fine on the math section but failed the language, botany and zoology sections, according to history.com. A 1984 New York Times story says that the essay Einstein wrote for this exam was “full of errors” but pointed to his later interests.</p>

<p>You under sell actual work ethic to promote a child who has no grasp on basic calculus- So its obvious your either being intentually naive, and sadistic; or simply &#39;are just that&#39;. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why doesn&#39;t he understand basic calculus?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I am well aware about the practical use of infinity. (as well as the symbol for its use); I&#39;ve just never seen it intently regurgitated by a minor thats suffering from child abuse live on youtube. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The practical use of <strong>infinities</strong>, not infinity. There are many varying grades of infinity, which is what you seem to be failing to grasp. Not all infinities are equal and they can be compared by their ordinality and cardinality. I hope you are familiar with set theory at least? Also, when writing infinity, the squiggle could be seen as an obvious shortcut to a whole figure-8, I do the same with my own writing (simplify symbols/greek letters). </p>

<blockquote>
<p>You have no explaination for your actions. This is called &#39;damage control&#39; or &#39;brain damage&#39;. Citing physicists as though your aware makes me feel you personally nurture this childs development. Its appauling-</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Dude, I don&#39;t believe the kid is legitimately a super-genius or going to change the world or even that what he is saying in the video is correct. I&#39;m just saying that all you&#39;ve done so far is label his parents as abusive for filming his (interesting and culturally relevant) explanations for Youtube. Hell, do you think his parents even know what he is talking about? If you listen to what the dad is asking him, his questions clearly don&#39;t comprehend or follow the subject matter at all. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I know einstein was a genius because its proven that his theories were his own- </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lmfao, relativity had been floating around since 1895, it just wasn&#39;t clearly defined. He did all his work on the backs of Poincare, Lorentz, Planck, and Hilbert, among others. His 1905 paper had no citations, but was clearly built off of Poincare&#39;s 1902 La science et l&#39;hypothèse. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1990/03/27/science/did-einstein-s-wife-contribute-to-his-theories.html">His own wife contributed quite a bit as well</a>. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a child pre programmed to recite exotic principals or responses, in an otherwise destructive and dangerous manner- (in relationship to his future)-</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I mean all information is just repeated and jumbled versions of stuff we learned somewhere else. Why is this nefarious?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There is no telling how severely affected he will become as his &#39;genius&#39; is picked apart revealing a sad mislead child whose parents filled his head with wild ideas and delusions of grandeur-</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not gonna disagree with you here, really. But that&#39;s just because of the &quot;genius&quot; label, not because I think it is somehow worse to make Youtube videos of it or have his parents be interested in his thoughts. </p>

<p>The father barely understands the Mandela effect, how do you think he understands how the weight of an electron would be tied to what universe formation we are in right now? Do you think he understands that tuning meta-parameters is equivalent to switching universes in a higher dimension? Do you think he understands the flatness problem and how this is relevant to our self-regulating universe? The father doesn&#39;t even understand his comparison of infinities, let alone what the kid is really trying to explain. </p>

<p>Yeah I&#39;m arguing because you&#39;re painting ignorant parents who clearly don&#39;t know what they&#39;re doing as nefarious, scheming devils planting false ideas in the mind of a child while somehow acting exactly as a person who doesn&#39;t understand what they are witnessing would. </p>

<p>These parents don&#39;t understand a damn thing their kid is saying, hence they go &quot;Geeze maybe someone on the Internet would know about this&quot; and post it on Youtube, and instead your magical theory is they invented all these theories, planted them in his mind and made him repeat them, and somehow play dumb about the whole thing?</p>

<p>It would be different if the kid reached the age of majority. Or even minority.

    <div class="md"><p>I fully understand the lines and concepts of the &#39;mandella effect&#39;. Yet its more easily said as differences in communications and lost wisdom via talking heads. </p>

<p>Add in intentional misinformation and imbellishment and there you have two seperate realitys sharing the same experiences. I.e. jan sees a car heading at her at a high rate of speed. Jon is the driver. They both explain the circumstances of the reality they witness from their own personal viewpoints. </p>

<p>Yet this is the same reality-</p>

<p>Hence information is stored in your brains matter. 
It is not impervious to being destroyed when the information is lost. This is why the barrier of life and death seperates humans from our field of existence-</p>

<p>Note we have 13 colliders now. Not much a conspiracy to assume that they have an ulterior use when they publically announce finding rare particles within their underground matrix&#39;s. 
Again 1 or 2 would be expected. When you see double digits it makes you have to makes one question their true intent..  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It really depends on the chamber design. </p>

<p>We have nitroglycerin by example and use processes to make the material mobile. So I see no complication in the worlds leading scientific bodies coming to a relevant solution. We already create antimatter fragments. They don&#39;t seem to destroy the colliders thenselves. </p>

<p>So there seems to be a logic fallocy within your own admission. Being the world as it is. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What I think is your one of the kids parents- or just as well equal to their failed interpretations of what makes a genius.</p>

<p>Einstein was a mathmatical genius using his skillset to explore the very algebra expressions utilized to discover patents. He already mastered basic mathematical expressions at an early age. So he was far more capable if expressing his work then you give him credit for. </p>

<p>You undersell actual work ethic to promote a  child who has no grasp on basic calculus- So its obvious your either being intentually naive and sadistic or simply are just that. </p>

<p>I am well aware about the practical use of infinity. (as well as the symbol for its use); Ive just never seen it regurgitated by a minor thats suffering from child abuse live on youtube. </p>

<p>You have no explaination for your actions. This is called &#39;damage control&#39; or &#39;brain damage&#39;. Citing physicists as though your aware makes me feel you personally nurture this childs development. Its appauling-</p>

<p>I know einstein was a genius because its proven that his theories were his own. </p>

<p>This is a child pre programmed to recite exotic principals in a dangerous manner-</p>

<p>There is no telling how severely affected he will become as his &#39;genius&#39; is picked apart revealing a sad mislead child whose parents filled his head with wild ideas and delusions of grandeur-</p>
