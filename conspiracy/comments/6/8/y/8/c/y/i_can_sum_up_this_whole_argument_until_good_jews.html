    <div class="md"><p>The Kazars were smart when they converted to Judaism. Centuries later, it still works to obfuscate their bullshit. Imagine how glorious life would be if they had just been butchered by the Ottomans? Not only would so many horrible things not have happened, but we wouldn&#39;t need to read stupid fucking posts like this one from people who are quite clueless as to the history behind anything they are talking about.</p>

<p>Amusingly, these people want to blame <em>all</em> Jews for the sins of a minority who aren&#39;t even really Jewish, while simultaneously they argue that they should not be held responsible for the sins of white slave holders in the past because they shouldn&#39;t be held accountable for the sins of a minority that they just happen to be ethnically similar to. </p>

It&#39;s just asking each group to understand that their behavior as a whole is unacceptable, yet we do not blame any one member, and that if they do not fix it themselves, there will be consequences, mainly in the form of all of society seeing you as a negative entity and all of the woes that come from that.

    <div class="md"><p>Until humans admit that all of us are good and band in different situations they we are all fucked. And humans are never going to admit that because humans are cowards who don&#39;t have the strength to look at life honestly and see that all of us exist at the expense of others and none of us are innocent. Blaming any other ethnic group for your own problems is the most pathetic and unworthy act a human can take.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry man. I think we are all unworthy sometimes. I honestly do, and that is just my point.</p>

<p>Man, I fucking hate Israel. I love Jews and I have greatly enjoyed the friendship of many Israelis, but I think Israel is bullshit. It&#39;s an apartheid state.</p>

<p>But before you are ready to condemn all the Jews who don&#39;t put themselves out there to denounce Israel, you should winder how much of your day you spend apologizing for the genocide of Native Americans, or Slavery in Africa. You know, all of us are dirty. Humans are fucking predators, and the law of the jungle is how the world really works.</p>

<p>And Hitler tried to exterminate the Jews. He tried to make a world with them. So they are kind of freaked out by that and for good reason. The crimes against the Palestinians have not happened in a vacuum and if you want to demand that Jews stop other Jews then we all need to immediately stop the people in out sects that are hurting people.</p>

<p>Well, I&#39;m a white American, so I guess I&#39;m supposed to stop the Police from abusing inner city black people. I know it happens. I&#39;m not sure how to stop it, but I want to. You know, that&#39;s how most Jews I know feel about Palestine. Not all, but most.</p>

<p>Never forget that a tiny small number of people - rich power elites - run the whole show. Not Jews. They are just people.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Honestly, none, but it&#39;s acknowledged to the point of massive societal guilt shared by those who did not commit those crimes, which is a good thing, and needs to be done for more Great Crimes, especially current ones.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t spend a lot of my time apologizing for past crimes that are already acknowledged, but I do spend quite a lot doing all I can to work against the crimes that are currently being committed by my very own country, largely by my race, by those who practice the religion of my nation, and a lot of the time by my gender. </p>

<p>It&#39;s asked of me, every single day (Dear White People, for one), and I think it&#39;s actually done good things for all the bad that it&#39;s caused. If we could just take that same &quot;I will do better and will make sure my brothers do as well&quot; attitude, and really make it fair (i.e., everyone do the same), which was the spirit that we were asked to do it in, then it could really change things. </p>

<p>It&#39;s like you said, we&#39;re all shitty sometimes, so let&#39;s really start holding each other accountable in the same way that we already do for people like (probably) you and me; it&#39;s shocking to me, sometimes, to see how many people who are the sole target of society&#39;s criticism stand against the same being done fairly to all. Surely there&#39;s a name for the behavior in some psychiatric journal or some such, like a Stockholm syndrome, but where you stand up for your position as the only one allowed to be picked on. It&#39;s beautiful, in a way, and very stoic, to willingly take on all the weight of a society&#39;s ire, but it needs to be seen for what it is if we&#39;re going to make progress. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think we disagree,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I know it happens. I&#39;m not sure how to stop it, but I want to.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>because that means you&#39;re a good person in my book. Just saying it, and maybe saying it often and keeping it close to your heart. That&#39;s not so bad, right? Just asking that to be done by every group?</p>
