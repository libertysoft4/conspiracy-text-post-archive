<p>“At some time or another pet food companies realized there was a cheap source of meat available… Dog Meat, and it could be purchased cheaply from animal shelters and the dog pound. These were places where dogs were euthanized weekly and there was always a need to dispose of the bodies. Nobody said anything and there were no laws preventing such from happening. However what started to tip the scales was that the veterinarians who performed the euthanasias at the animal shelters started noticing it was taking more and more drugs to put these animals to sleep. They realized that somehow pets in animal shelters were building up an immunity to the medications used to end their lives.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>No pet lover in their right mind would ever wish to feed their dog or cat ground up dog and cat.  But that is exactly what is happening.  Deep within the EPA document ‘Emissions Factors and Policy Applications Center, Chapter 9: Food and Agricultural Industries, Section 9.5 Introduction to Animal &amp; Meat Products Preparation’ is the section 9.5.3 Meat Rendering Plants.  The truth is crystal clear.</p>

<p>“Meat rendering plants process animal by-product materials for the production of tallow, grease, and high-protein meat and bone meal.  Plants that operate in conjunction with animal slaughterhouses or poultry processing plants are called integrated rendering plants.  Plants that collect their raw materials from a variety of offsite sources are called independent rendering plants.  Independent plants obtain animal by-product materials, including grease, blood, feathers, offal, and entire animal carcasses, from the following sources:  butcher shops, supermarkets, restaurants, fast-food chains, poultry processors, slaughterhouses, farms, ranches, feedlots, and <strong>animal shelters</strong>.”  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand your point, fully. The issue here, however, is not that pets are being used for animal feed, per se,  but that animals should never be fed diseased members of their own species. Prion diseases affect many species, prions are not destroyed in the rendering process, and there is evidence that prions can cross species despite previous beliefs of the scientific community.</p>

<p>Animal prion diseases include scrapie of sheep and goats, bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) or mad cow disease, transmissible mink encephalopathy, feline spongiform encephalopathy, exotic ungulate spongiform encephalopathy, chronic wasting disease of cervids and spongiform encephalopathy of primates.</p>

<p>Prions transmitted to housecats by feeding them​ dead housecats can be transmitted into mountain lions when they come into rural areas for a snack, for example.</p>

<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077598/">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077598/</a><br/>
Roger Ebert going over the top with praise:<br/>
&#39;&#39;They form the truth at the center of Errol Morris&#39; 1978 documentary, which is surrounded by layer upon layer of comedy, pathos, irony, and human nature. I have seen this film perhaps 30 times, and am still not anywhere near the bottom of it: All I know is, it&#39;s about a lot more than pet cemeteries.&#39;&#39;<br/>

    <div class="md"><p>I remember back in the 90&#39;s that a certain highend brand was  using any downed animals as protein base in their pet food.</p>

<p>It was found out after a series of pet deaths, both cat and dog, and something about cow feed too if I remember right. Basically your animals were eating sick cows, poultry, or pig, as well as pets that were euthanized. This apparently was spreading several diseases and drugs, I think it was called one of the causes prion disease &quot;Mad cow&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Basically animal cannibalism. Aside from being disgusting, it&#39;s also unhealthy.</p>

<p>I think this is how some diseases get started and spread around. One sick dog gets euthanized and  the dogs that eat the food made from it can (in the right circumstances) catch it&#39;s diseases.</p>

<p>One example? Prions. Those are the things that cause mad cow disease. Not sure if there&#39;s a dog equivalent. But stuff like this is the reason why you don&#39;t feed animals food made out of the same animals.</p>

<p>Uhm... What? You appear to be one if those folks that is confused about the definition of conspiracy.  </p>

<p>People on this sub discussing this issue, or 9/11, or wretched things that politicians do but try to hide... None of that can be labeled &quot;conspiracy&quot;.</p>

<p>As it says in the sidebar:</p>

<p>Conspiracy - a secret plan by a group to do something unlawful or harmful</p>

<pre><code>Theory - a supposition or a system of ideas intended to explain something

Conspiracy Theory - a hypothesis that some covert but influential organization is responsible for a circumstance or event
</code></pre>

<p>You might think that this is a dumb <em>conspiracy theory</em>,  but it is pretty obvious that the FDA knows that pentobarbital is making its way not only into pet food supplies, but into human food supplies, and THAT is the conspiracy. </p>
