        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This post is not going to be necessarily deep or complex. It is just going to be about some thoughts that deeply trouble me as I start the work week. Sometimes I feel like I do not recognize the world I live in - of course, these are only generalizations.</p>

<p>*People are exhausted but have no choice but to keep working and working more. Work for the sake of work is valued in our society. The other day I saw the cashier at Wal-Mart with the energy drink, and I felt for her. Rest and relaxation are becoming more of a rarity.</p>

<p><a href="http://abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=93604">http://abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=93604</a></p>

<p>*Good is only valued if it can be showed off on social media. Good has to be tied to a profit, or a celebrity, or a selfie. Do not forget that you should never feed the homeless on the streets though.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2014/10/22/357846415/more-cities-are-making-it-illegal-to-hand-out-food-to-the-homeless">http://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2014/10/22/357846415/more-cities-are-making-it-illegal-to-hand-out-food-to-the-homeless</a></p>

<p><em>We are more &quot;connected&quot; than ever right? We can access others&#39; lives at anytime, but the human element is missing. Social media often creates envy and jealousy, not love and friendship. Every time I post about this, I get comments on how it is just a tool, and it is how we use it. However, I have to say that it is not only a tool when Facebook admits to purposely manipulating its users. It is not a tool for a 14 year old, waiting for 300 &quot;likes&quot; on the latest selfie. The problem is that balance of social media is not promoted, and now everything is connected to social media. There are countless studies on the negative aspects, yet they are mostly ignored. It is not *only</em> a tool when we are the tools.</p>

<p>*We spend endless amounts of money to go to college and get a degree, only to end up jobless and drowning in debt. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/larryalton/2016/12/22/millennials-are-struggling-to-get-jobs-heres-why-and-what-to-do-about-it/">https://www.forbes.com/sites/larryalton/2016/12/22/millennials-are-struggling-to-get-jobs-heres-why-and-what-to-do-about-it/</a></p>

<p>*We are giving our youth the full power of adults before they even understand and know how to handle that power. From choosing their genders to getting phones in the 2nd grade, our kids are being treated as if they are...well...not children. Do our children have their childhoods anymore? Do they play outside? Or are they glued to their phone as soon as they get home from school? I am throwing a lot in here, but as somebody who works with children, I do not envy this upcoming generation.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jul/27/children-spend-only-half-the-time-playing-outside-as-their-parents-did">https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jul/27/children-spend-only-half-the-time-playing-outside-as-their-parents-did</a></p>

<p>*Our food makes us sick, and even when people DO have health insurance, it is still terrifying for most to go to the hospital, even in an emergency. There is no denying that food is more processed than ever, and there is no denying that our health care system in America is a joke. This is NOT a conspiracy, really. </p>

<p>People may have food, but that does not mean they have nutrition.</p>

<p>Let us not forget for those who live healthily and do all the &quot;right&quot; things, cancer rates (among other diseases) are on the rise.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2014/02/04/health/who-world-cancer-report/">http://www.cnn.com/2014/02/04/health/who-world-cancer-report/</a></p>

<p>*Our education system is a disaster. I have written much about this all over Reddit, so it is hard to summarize everything here. Let&#39;s just say that poor schools are punished for poor performance, and their funding is cut. Wealthy schools are given more money for good performance. If there is any sign that our schools are failing, it cannot be more clear than the treatment of teachers. Underpaid, burnt out, and villainized, more and more teachers are leaving the profession:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/teachers-crisis-education-leaving-profession-jobs-market-droves-who-would-be-one-a7591821.html">http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/teachers-crisis-education-leaving-profession-jobs-market-droves-who-would-be-one-a7591821.html</a></p>

<p>The issues in education are endless, but do not worry, because the testing corporations are still making their money!</p>

<p>*We hear all about love and breaking boundaries and barriers today, but doesn&#39;t it feel superficial? It is so easy to preach about love, kindness, and compassion for others, but our actions always speak louder than our words.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/artificial-maturity/201403/why-empathy-is-declining-among-students-and-what-we-can-do">https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/artificial-maturity/201403/why-empathy-is-declining-among-students-and-what-we-can-do</a></p>

<p>*People can call me old-fashioned or too &quot;conservative&quot; but what are our morals and values today? Who are our role models in increasingly broken homes? All I ever here is &quot;do what you want as long as it makes you happy&quot; but is this really the right way?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/183467/majority-say-moral-values-getting-worse.aspx">http://www.gallup.com/poll/183467/majority-say-moral-values-getting-worse.aspx</a></p>

<p>*Materialism, consumerism, and greed. What do people live for? Is there time to think about the existential questions of life, or is it more important to make sure our social media presence reflects how &quot;happy&quot; we are...Is there any depth in our daily lives? Or do we live through mindless celebrities? One of my favorite books is called &quot;The Unbearable Lightness of Being&quot;, and I feel the title is quite fitting for this world. The constant stress to &quot;keep up&quot;, and the illusion of the American Dream...are what we live for?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2854440/There-no-American-Dream-one-professor-believes-national-ethos-illusion-country-no-higher-rate-social-mobility-medieval-England.html">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2854440/There-no-American-Dream-one-professor-believes-national-ethos-illusion-country-no-higher-rate-social-mobility-medieval-England.html</a></p>

<p>*Speaking of books, nobody really reads anymore. I am not talking about reading celebrity gossip websites. I am talking about reading that requires discipline.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/09/07/the-long-steady-decline-of-literary-reading/">https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/09/07/the-long-steady-decline-of-literary-reading/</a></p>

<p>What do you feel the consequences will be?</p>

<p>*There is an emphasis on youth and beauty, but the wisdom of the elderly is denied. More and more have become obsessed with &quot;living forever&quot;, a theme prevalant in pop culture. Transhumanism is no longer science fiction. Yet, technology is good for the sake of technology right? The ethics issues behind incressing use of technology are simply ignored.</p>

<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/26/the-ethics-of-transhumanism/">https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/26/the-ethics-of-transhumanism/</a></p>

<p>*Mental illness and suicide are on the rise. Yet people have to hide their true feelings from the world. It is almost impossible to get &quot;good&quot; mental health care that is not atrociously expensive, even with &quot;good&quot; health insurance. More and more are suffering silenty with anxiety and depression. Mental illness and suicide are on the rise among Americans. But do not worry - one of your friends just posted a status about how great their life is on Facebook!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.techtimes.com/articles/205140/20170418/mental-illness-and-suicide-on-the-rise-amid-americans-study.htm">http://www.techtimes.com/articles/205140/20170418/mental-illness-and-suicide-on-the-rise-amid-americans-study.htm</a></p>

<p>I can keep going. As I get ready for work, these thoughts just bombarded me. Many may say I am ignoring the &quot;good&quot; in the world, or that I am being too serious. I disagree. I feel our society chooses to ignore the &quot;bad&quot;, and until a person is directly affected by something I mentioned in this post (or something I did not have time to mention), empathy for others is nonexistent. </p>

<p>Solace comes for me in the beauty of nature (which is continually being destroyed), the power of words (even if people are increasingly apathetic), and my relationships with others (though I find them harder to maintain as people, at least to me, are increasingly self-absorbed).</p>

<p>The world feels upside down today, but I am going to work now, and I have to tell my students that they will be okay. (Non-intended rhyme).</p>

<p>What are your thoughts?</p>

<p>Edit: I did not expect this to blow up. J am replying to as many people as possible because it means a lot for people to read and comment. Even if you do not think anybody will read or care what you have to say, I will.</p>

<p>Whoever gave me the gold, I wish I knew who it was. Thank you!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Isn&#39;t crazy that this issue is just swept under the rug?</p>

<p>People who have mental illness have to feel shame and do not get the proper care and attention they need. For many, suicide seems like the most viable option.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Chomsky once stated that the true metric for how great a society is can be found in how they treat their dis-enfranchised. The mentally ill, homeless, veterans, etc.; by this metric it is hard to call America &quot;great&quot;.</p>

<p>There is a book called &quot;Hagakure&quot; (my copy is being lent to a friend currently so I&#39;ll have to paraphrase) that states that virtuous ideas and concepts <em>must</em> be whispered into the ears of the young.

<p>People separate themselves from the homeless, mentally ill, etc...thinking they are not &quot;like them&quot;. But I think we are all closer to the &quot;brink&quot; of suffering than we fully realize.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Our society elevates people who objectively are morally corrupt and possibly mentally ill. Narcissists run companies and hold positions of power. We admire and respect the ruthless businessperson who tramples on everyone else on the way up and is then lauded as the epitome of success. Then we wonder why society is falling apart at the seams everywhere else.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lots of mentally ill and homeless just want to be left alone. They don&#39;t want to be part of this shit society with its shit customs and manners and hypocrisy. So please don&#39;t say the solution is to build institutions to force these people into so they can be &#39;recuperated&#39; by the same sort of people they abandoned society and &#39;reason&#39; to avoid. Don&#39;t require people to go through a thousand programs and sign a thousand forms and interviews and bullshit to get free stuff, or they just go without completely. Got more vacant homes than homeless people. How does that work?</p>

<p>There is a book called &quot;Hagakure&quot; (my copy is being lent to a friend currently so I&#39;ll have to paraphrase) that states that virtuous ideas and concepts must be whispered into the ears of the young.

<p>It&#39;s still done. For example, it&#39;s done by advertisers who target children, so that they can instill narratives of consumerism into them, while they&#39;re impressionable and formulating their place in the world. </p>

<p>And your thread is a good one, our world as it stands is pointless. We don&#39;t have any earthly goals but war and money. More realize this now than in the past century for sure.

    <div class="md"><p>What is mental illness really, though? Many who are &quot;diagnosed&quot; with something as a result of tough times to me that is just called life. I was diagnosed in 93/94 with ADHD and given no lie 11 then 7 dexadrine pills a DAY. I have a tested IQ(I know these tests are bs) of 150. My brain processes thoughts and decisions lightning fast and very few can keep pace with me mentally. Apparently this means I have a mental illness rather than just a brain that processes things very quickly.  Why is this a bad thing, other than the fact I recognize and call people out on their bullshit  as soon as I detect it quickly in conversation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do tend to agree with you that many of these more commonly seen &quot;disorders&quot; are over-diagnosed. I don&#39;t claim to know why this is, beyond ofc kick backs and greed, plus an ever-widening list of symptoms in the DSM, but here&#39;s the thing that I feel like a lot of people seem to overlook, or not understand: these things only become a &quot;disorder&quot; when it begins to affect your life in ways that you cannot handle or deal with, when it becomes much too much for you, something you cannot get a grip on no matter how hard you try and it&#39;s causing you to despair. If a person has all the symptoms of a certain non-severe/acute mental illness but is not bothered by them and is completely comfortable living their life then there is no need to treat them... For example, with your ADHD: if you&#39;d been unable to complete your schooling, no matter how hard you try and this becomes distressing to you. This is the key. A good doctor and/or psych would explain the difference to you, and yes, I realize &quot;good&quot; doctors are hella rare these days... realize too, though, that your doctor is often used to working with patients who WANT a quick fix, they WANT medication for minor, almost nonexistent issues, they are unwilling to put in the work... when you are used to working with that every day, yes, sometimes assumptions are made which shouldn&#39;t be. </p>

<p>A &quot;good&quot; doctor really is a wonderful thing... it took me 30 years to find one but now that I have one, I can honestly say that it was turned my life upside down, in a very good way. She is amazing. I never even realized that doctors like this actually existed but now that I&#39;ve found her(by a serendipidous accident of sorts) I cannot imagine seeing anyone else.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry for the delayed response to your very detailed and thought out post.  With my ADHD I quit my meds against everyone&#39;s wishes at 24 because I felt like a zombie. And again they still wanted me on 4-5 dexadrine a day at that time which was nuts. I graduated with a 3.5 GPA even though I literally never studied, had a successful military then state corrections career (until being Injured on the job in both) so I don&#39;t feel like my ADHD has ever held me back in life. The unique perspective I gain from life is worth the struggles I&#39;ve faced IMO.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>(SPOILERS)
In the film Cpt. Jack Sparrow has been &quot;banished/died&quot; and moved to a realm that is considered to be &quot;beyond this worlds end.&quot;</p>

<p>This real looks like a completely white desert with no trees, structures or otherwise like the sahara desert IRL (only that the larger stones/pebbels are white crabs). </p>

<p>The Pirate crew of the portagonists plans to rescue Sparrow. They get maps and sail towards the world end, where they are literally turning their pirate ship upside down in the water and sink to the ground. Then they are &quot;Teleported&quot; to the realm where Sparrow is. </p>

<p>What is noticeable that two (undead) pirate crewmates tie themselves to the ship-masts to be standing straight while the human pirates are upside down. I think the freemasonic hollywood wants to symbolize the inversal of life the death (upside down)
White the &quot;worlds end&quot; is lifes end itself.</p>

Just a 3rd perspective more or less to my feelings but it was &quot;manadatory&quot; for me to take medicine. Went with a co-pay system. Therapist cost me $20 for an hour session that was weekly. Cool. </p>

<p>However to get my prescription meant I had to sit down with an entirely different Doctor for 10 minutes and that 10 minutes cost me $200 on top of $40 for the pills. Fucking cash cowing the mentally ill was one of the worst things I&#39;ve personally witnessed. A lot of the people who came in and out weren&#39;t bad off and only needed some advice like me. </p>

<p>Thankfully I&#39;ve always been anti pill and my goal was to get off them as quick as possible unlike the ones who are totally convinced they can&#39;t feel good without the meds.

I remember at the end of the dream though...something happens. 
Either a global currency reset, or something causes the government and the banks to forgive all student loan debt, and offer debt forgiveness to others.</p>

<p>Maybe we finally have a call to audit the Fed, or audit the Military. Didn&#39;t the Pentagon misplace 6.8 trillion dollars? That&#39;s tax money. We should demand a refund.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wonder if heroin is a more concerntrated form of opioid. You know like smoking the plant marajuana is less potent than the synthetic one?

    <div class="md"><p>It is. Opium(natural plant form) itself is pretty addictive on its own, contains a mix of opiates like morphine, codeine, thebaine, etc. But they acetylate the morphine and makes it way more potent and more addictive. Kinda like how coca leaves are a nice pick me up and used culturally, but with the right chem and process, becomes addictive cocaine.</p>

The problem is that in our world, being a realist, cynic or pessimist are one in the same because of all the things OP mentioned. This is why so many people choose to ignore the true world we live in and indulge in social media and bullshit, even though it&#39;s hardly any healthier in the long run. It&#39;s disgusting that we literally have to choose to sacrifice our mental wellbeing just to be engaged in our society. Those two things should complement each other. </p>

That&#39;s how to make the world a better place and the best way to evoke the changes we all seek.  Sorry you went to so much trouble to make this and I am sure my comment will be downvoted to hell because misery loves company, but everyone who is on the service-to-others quantum timeline is really going to be okay.  If you let the illusions of a shitty world get you down, the &quot;powers that shouldn&#39;t be&quot; have won.  Those who only work with service-to-self frequencies will go to another hellish duality timeline.  It really is going to be all right.</p>

<p>Maybe I can discuss larger conspiracies with people so we start to learn we are not alone.</p>

<p>Maybe we can unite for good causes.</p>

And when they do, the gov will stamp down on them so hard they&#39;ll decide it really isn&#39;t that bad after all. </p>

I&#39;ve had people tell me they&#39;ve felt that their whole lives and the show keeps on going.  </p>

<p>I also have a smidgen of hope that the people in the military wouldn&#39;t turn on the people they&#39;re supposed to be protecting (yes we all know that the military hasn&#39;t been being used for that).  I just feel like most military people also know it&#39;s all just BS, and if they had an order to mow down civilians, its either kill em or court martial right?

    <div class="md"><p>June 2017. Speech by a prolific leftist. Agent provocateur lines up the shot and takes them out. &quot;Protests&quot; ensue. Buildings and business burnt by &quot;anti-fa&quot; types across the U.S. Nationalists (Trumpers) ally together and civil war breaks out in major cities across the U.S. </p>

<p>Situation deteriorates, National Guard is attacked and overwhelmed. Infighting begins within the U.S. military as ideology is questioned. U.S. requests U.N. presence. Chinese, Russian, and European troops land on American soil. Factions emerge, and seeing weakness, China captures Hawaii and attacks the west coast. Lines are muddled and total war spreads across the entire contiguous U.S. Canada watches on, with poutine and gravy in their laps... for now. </p>

<p>Nothing wrong with snacking either!  I myself snack a lot, but it&#39;s healthy snacking - a few celery sticks, carrots, and some peanuts, or a banana with homemade peanut butter, maybe a fruit smoothie with fresh local fruit every now and then.  If you&#39;re on a diet, or trying to gain muscle, snacking is great.  Smaller meals are better, especially if you exercise a lot.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Coconut water is great, but too much of it during competition can cause bloating and an upset stomach.  I mix it in with water and the orange juice i make and some salt.  Works great.  Usually the formula is a few oranges (I use 3 or 4 because I like a really fruity taste), probably half a small bottle of coconut water, and the rest water, with some ice cubes too to keep it cold or from getting too hot.  A pinch of salt and a little bit of lemon juice (sometimes i add lime juice too) and it works just fine.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>True! I was diagnosed with an autoimmune disease related to eye muscles (i know, weird. My own body attacks my own EYE muscles), I was so sick I had to quit med school because I was failing my subjects cos I couldn&#39;t study well (doctors put me in depressants to decrease brain fx whilst increasing my prednisone or corticosteroid to HELP inflammation= increase cortisol= increase stress). </p>

<p>I eventually became bed- ridden. I was so sick of being sick so I researched on alternative ways to control my autoimmune disease and guys, after 9 years I am off any meds! </p>

<p>It was when I started eating well and exercising properly and, not to mention removing toxic people and thoughts, that my body helped itself heal as well so yes, I do believe diet and exercise helps! But society tells us otherwise. </p>

<p>Sorry for the long post. I just want to share how eating well and exercsing reallg helped in controlling my disease. :)</p>

Refined sugars, wheat, most dairy, and processed foods are pretty much devoid of nutrients and just starve the body.  Organic means a lot less exposure to herbicides.

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I may have some fruit in the AM, coffee with cream. But mostly I skip breakfast. For lunch I will have a huge salad, lettuce, spinach, kale, peppers, onions, carrots. I may have some rolled up lunch meat and cheese (no bread) if Idon&#39;t have a lot of salad.</p>

<p>Dinner is meat, steak, chicken, fish (all types) and cooked veggies. I eat around 1 pm and 6:30 pm. ISince this diet began, I do not snack and I&#39;m usually never hungry.</p>

<p>I drink a ton of water, if I go to a bar, it&#39;s vodka club with limes.. easily the most boring part, but oh well.</p>

<p>I try to have less than a gram of sugar a day and can usually achieve this. Look , if I&#39;m at a b-day party and cake is served, I&#39;m not going to be a jerk, but I try to make it a smaller peice.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reddit is passive in terms of its marketing, they dont directly market to your inbox, emails, etc. Because of the anonymity it doesnt allow for them to gather specific demographics about people, unless they willingly submit. There are tons of chat boards, AIM type devices, Web Pages and Meet Ups that allow people to discuss these things privately. Meetup.com is pretty cool that allows people to create meet ups for specific topics. I went to a Nick Redfern meet/greet/discussion that was pretty cool, and it was local, in turn putting me in contact with many like minded people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its not ad hominem or false analogy. You have clearly pointed to your belief and disdain for the manipulative mechanism of SM, then walked that back with the use it in a balanced way arguement. Which are opposite sides of the same argument. You want social media, but know its manipulating you. You wont admit that you have taking both points of an argument to suit your own desires and not the factual information you presented. Henceforth, the 12 year old with a stove. You know its dangerous, but out of sheer unwillingness to walk away, you will keep touching the hot stove and then complaining that it burned you. If you want to keep throwing surface level debate logical fallacies, you wont win. Its a typical liberal move to spout off a bunch of log fallacies to try to back someone down, but that wont work with me, especially when you moved your own goal post. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think there is a plenty of other ways to communicate information. Both Passively or directly. Social Media communicates directly what it wants too, in order to manipulate. There are plenty of ways to pass info. The entire purpose of social media is to manipulate for profit. If thats is the core of its purpose its much easier to use a passive method to communicate instead of forcing something you personally enjoy into fitting a specific desire of a group of people.</p>

<p><em>We are more &quot;connected&quot; than ever right? We can access others&#39; lives at anytime, but the human element is missing. Social media often creates envy and jealousy, not love and friendship. Every time I post about this, I get comments on how it is just a tool, and it is how we use it. However, I have to say that it is not only a tool when Facebook admits to purposely manipulating its users. It is not a tool for a 14 year old, waiting for 300 &quot;likes&quot; on the latest selfie. The problem is that balance of social media is not promoted, and now everything is connected to social media. There are countless studies on the negative aspects, yet they are mostly ignored. It is not *only a tool when we are the tools.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>You are literally posting your <em>&quot;thoughts&quot;</em> about social media on a social media website...I hope others didn&#39;t miss out on this humorous level of irony.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Stop with this nonsense. Ways of obtaining information didn&#39;t stop progressing after books were created. Reading books for the sake of it is not something that deserves adulation in any way especially if all someone reads is fiction.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Regurgitating things you&#39;ve heard or seen other people say as your own thoughts is intellectually lazy. I wish people would self-moderate their urges to share every low effort epiphany they find online.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here is a recent Reddit post on this very topic.  &quot;The more time a young adult uses social media, the more likely they are to feel socially isolated. Study suggests use of social media doesn’t present a panacea to reduce perceived social isolation. Past studies have shown that social isolation is associated with an increased risk for mortality.&quot;
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/5y00cv/the_more_time_a_young_adult_uses_social_media_the/">https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/5y00cv/the_more_time_a_young_adult_uses_social_media_the/</a> </p>

<p>Reddit is the only &quot;social media&quot; that I use or even have an account with.   Truthfully, I do believe I feel more socially isolated, as the post title puts it, in the time since I have used Reddit.  I cannot imagine if I also had facebook, twitter, snapchat, and a myriad of other social media apps on my phone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My only real complaint is the food one. You only get over processed foods if that is what you buy. You can still buy fruit, veggies, meat and fiber and be fine dietary wise.  All the processed shit comes from eating fast food or buying prepackaged items.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll be real here. I&#39;m a pretty big dude, you know I&#39;m fat. I use to buy all prepared processed stuff, cuz I thought it was cheap and easy.</p>

<p>In the past idk like 4 months I&#39;ve completely changed my diet. I buy fruits, vegetables, meat, some grains and other odds and ends. My bull has gone down, substantially. I spend about 200 a month now, 50 a week or so. I was spending more before because 6 frozen dinners at 5 a pop is much more money then 11 dollars for 6 chicken breasts ot the 8 dollars I spend for 6 turkey cutlets for my lunch. For 20 dollars though I know have all my protein for the week. The other 30 is getting fruit which i agree gets expensive, and vegetables which are pretty cheap. </p>

<p>Healthy food isn&#39;t hard to make or prepare it only is if you choose to do it that way. I felt the same way before I said fuck it and started doing everything myself. I will admit though I have a tool for cooking that cuts my cooking time of meats on half which is a godsend. I have an electric grill that cooks both sides of meat at the same time. But otherwise it would still only be like 20 minutes from start to finish to cook  your meat. Most of the other stuff is eaten raw after being washed off, or just a simple bake for 20 mins with some salt and pepper thrown on.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not on top Chef so my food is kept super simple  the most complex stuff I make is either my fancy fried rice or stir fry which are both fairly simple to do.</p>

<p>If it sounds like I&#39;m down playing food deserts or talking down to you, I&#39;m not and I&#39;m not trying to sound that way. As food deserts are a very real thing that fuck over large chunks of the population that live in cities and other times in rural areas. I mean it&#39;s a real problem when it makes news in the city of Chicago and surrounding subarb that 2 new jewels and also a whole food are going to be opening in the city, it really showcases the problem.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah the sugar addiction is def real. And so is emotional eating. These two things cause real problems that don&#39;t get addressed.

    <div class="md"><p>Not true at all.  Healthy food is cheaper than fast food, but you have to prepare it yourself.  </p>

<p>Even if you go to the most expensive grocery stores such as Whole Foods, healthy food is much cheaper.  Produce is cheap.  You&#39;re just choosing to eat more processed stuff.  Farmer&#39;s markets are even cheaper.  And if you have a family member who isn&#39;t working, they can get a job pretty easily at a place like WF where family members get a 30% discount on all products.  </p>

<p>I cut out processed sugar a few weeks ago, and it&#39;s been going well.  Granted, I&#39;ll break the diet exactly 3 times a year (to eat a homemade cake, made on my, my brother, and my father&#39;s birthdays), but other than that I&#39;ve been only getting sugar from fruit.  I&#39;m already gluten-free (celiac&#39;s disease), so cutting out more crap from what I eat isn&#39;t hard.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with a lot of things you&#39;ve said.</p>

<p>I think what it boils down to is personal responsibility.  Each of us have to make decisions that affect us and our families and friends.</p>

<p>Take food, for example.  My family has been gardening since the 1930s.  While we don&#39;t get all of our food from our gardens, we do get fresh vegetables and fruit during the season, and grow enough to put up for the winter and early spring.  If we have surplus, we share it with neighbors and friends.  Otherwise, we belong to a local food co-operative.  Once a month, an 18 wheeler from Erewhon shows up at someone&#39;s garage and we spend a happy few hours dividing up 50lb bags of beans and rice, cutting up wheels of cheddar cheese, and distributing boxes of dried fruits and vegetables.  It&#39;s fun for the adults, and the kids learn about taking inventory, purchasing and cooking from an early age.  We only eat vegetables, fruit, cheese, eggs (from our own chickens), dairy, whole wheat bread (that my wife bakes), and once in a while, locally raised beef or pork as a treat.  We&#39;re not vegetarians, we&#39;re just frugal.  The kids drink milk, apple cider we make ourselves, or water.  We do go out to eat once in a while, and yes we splurge on something yummy.</p>

<p>Regarding cell phones and other devices, we don&#39;t allow our children to have their own cell phones or other devices until they are old enough to pay for them on their own.  We don&#39;t give them allowances, but we do pay them for work they do that are above and beyond daily chores that every child has such as splitting wood for the stoves, turning over the garden by hand, etc.</p>

<p>About reading.  I read between 2-3 books a week.  It&#39;s down a lot since I was younger when I read 4-5 books a week.  I&#39;m reading all of Graham Hancock&#39;s books and following up on the references in them.  I recently read a biography of John Lennon which was fantastic.  I still love to read.  There&#39;s nothing better than curling up with a good book and a cup of tea for a few hours.  I do watch movies on Netflix once in a while, but I threw my tv set out in 1999 and don&#39;t miss it one bit.</p>

<p>About materialism and greed.  I&#39;ve been frugal most of my life and even more so now that I&#39;m old.  Frugality just means being more present in life.  I don&#39;t have any credit cards.  If I really need something, I save up for it and pay cash (or buy a prepaid card).   don&#39;t care one spit about what my neighbors or friends are buying, I don&#39;t give a shit about fashion or clothes.  I like mine to be comfortable and sturdy, last a long time.  I like clothes that I can go canoeing in if that makes sense.  My cars are paid for and well maintained.  My house is paid for and cared for.  My only expense other than utilities is taxes and insurance.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>By what he did for me. I&#39;m in my 30&#39;s, he healed my pain I had in my life, nothing has worked before accepting him. Once I took that step and fully believed he died for us, because that is how much he loves us, all those cliche Christian phrases you hear all made complete sense. There is not really one thing that I can point out to make you understand, its a sum total of things I have learned and felt. One tho, I love conspiracies been interested in them for 10 plus years, and once you keep digging and digging, you will find that there really is a bigger picture going on, and ultimately everything is trying to get your focus away from Jesus. What I have noticed is ultimately what we are seeing is God and lucifer are battling for our souls. I know it sounds crazy, but what you experience by accepting Jesus is absolutely amazing! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a Machine Head song, <em>Imaginal Cells</em>, in the song they have voice overs from a book called <em>The Biology of Belief and Spontaneous Evolution</em>. The content of the book and song definitely confirmed a bias for me so I don&#39;t take it very seriously at all, but the words spoke to me on a &quot;spiritual level&quot; and gave me a positive outlook despite all of the chaos and the overall gloomy feel of the beginning of the song and voice over. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s the authors site: <a href="https://www.brucelipton.com/books/spontaneous-evolution">https://www.brucelipton.com/books/spontaneous-evolution</a></p>

<p>I believe this is a copy of the audio: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJpsb0krC_4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJpsb0krC_4</a></p>

<p>So basically the content as I interpreted it basically says we&#39;re due for a time of social upheaval as society clashes with the new ideas being put out there by the younger generations, there will be a rise of mental illness and suicide, as there normally is noted during times of strife and turmoil, and there will be a rise of other symptoms of change and strife, war, increased poverty, and so on. However there also will be a rise of new ideas as the younger generations take the reins of leadership and the overall progress of man.</p>

<p>Now these times won&#39;t be easy because as you can see the more conservative of us aren&#39;t giving in without a fight, but to the authors they are dinosaurs railing against the march of progress, they are stuck in the old ways of thinking and if they don&#39;t get out of the way societies progression will grind them underneath. </p>

<p>I am far more progressive than anything else politically, but a lot of my leanings are more centrist, like my stances on the 2nd amendment and war. But I keep my eyes are always down the road while still using the past as lessons to learn from them for the future. So this spoke to me and I agree with the observations and the overall hypothesis, it definitely made me feel like a bias was confirmed for myself.</p>

No matter how dark the world around you is, keep letting your light shine and do the best you can to open the eyes of those around you. Set the best example you can for everyone you cross paths with.

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with a lot of your post, but there are some upsides in this upside-down world.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There is no denying that food is more processed than ever</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would say one solace here is that we also have a lot more choice in avoiding these processed food than we did 10-20 years ago. There has been a huge consumer push away from processed foods as it came known how awful they are for you. So while there are so many processed foods on the market, consumers do have the choice to not buy them in addition to a wider variety and access to fresh foods. We need the education in place to move people away from these foods, but at least now the options are out there. Additionally, while food deserts still exist throughout the US, luckily there has been a shrinking trend it how far people have to travel to access fresh foods. Which I think lack of access was a big reason a lot of people weren&#39;t eating fresh foods.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>More and more have become obsessed with &quot;living forever&quot;, a theme prevalant in pop culture.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The concept of eternal youth isn&#39;t a new trend. The fountain of youth tale goes back to the 5th century BC and there have been several tales over millennium of eternal youth in addition to idolizing youth and beauty. I don&#39;t think on it&#39;s own it is a horrible trend, but what terrifies me about it is that we a now getting very close to making it a reality with scientific advances. It then comes to question how much strain will we put on an already overpopulated earth if are birth and death rates are not similar. Additionally, the ability for the older generations to be able to work way past standard retirement age also creates job shortages already strained by automation for the younger generations. We are already seeing some of this occur today, and a lot of it isn&#39;t because the older generation feels healthy enough to work, it&#39;s because they do not have enough of a security net to retire, so they work out of necessity instead of desire. </p>

<p>Also within all of this ties the worry of wealthy vs. poor. If there are these scientific advancements, they will be extremely expensive either at first or forever depending on the technology. With this comes the question of do only the wealthy deserve new grown organs, genome alterations, guaranteed cancer treatments, etc., just because they can afford them? We of course see this occurring today with health care, but what happens when it is life span or life altering? Money seems to cure a lot of issues within the system, it can buy you water once there are fresh water shortages, it can buy you food once there are fresh food shortages, it can buy you a new heart once your current one wears out. Which all of this feeds into the worry of automation, where those that are on top of it and own it will only become wealthier if something isn&#39;t done now to prevent it. I hope we can sort it out, but like you said we never will if you do not get corporate interests out of our political system.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Build homes or apartment complexes, on government land, create a resource center where they could learn job skills or get their GED if they don&#39;t have it. There are a whole bunch of resources we just allow them to waste. We could start asking Uber or Lyft to ask for donations of canned food once a week. They both serve millions of customers daily combined. I&#39;d think that would solve some issues about hunger. I&#39;ve tried to reach out to Uber about the idea, but they haven&#39;t put forth anything yet. All we have to do is use our brains and figure out ways to fix societies issues.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>*Mental illness and suicide are on the rise. Yet people have to hide their true feelings from the world. It is almost impossible to get &quot;good&quot; mental health care that is not atrociously expensive, even with &quot;good&quot; health insurance. More and more are suffering silently with anxiety and depression. Mental illness and suicide are on the rise among Americans. But do not worry - one of your friends just posted a status about how great their life is on Facebook!</p>

<p>It&#39;s hard to trust mental health providers and pharmaceutical companies even.  Our health care system is profit driven, so patients are at best, a second priority to profit margins and shareholders.  </p>

<p>Look at Mylan.  If you went to a car lot and found a car with a 4000% markup, you would expect that to be a pretty good fucking car, right?   But it&#39;s not.  It functions the same as all the other cars.  It looks like all the other cars.  You&#39;d walk right off the lot, right?  Of course you would, because only a fool pays 4000% more for a product that does the same as the other 9 identical products on the market.  </p>

<p>But, with Mylan, it&#39;s not just the over-priced car being made available next to all the other cars - that alone is audacious enough.  In some states, it&#39;s the only car on the market.  In some cases, Mylan was in a position to sue if you DIDN&#39;T buy their product.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like being told &quot;You have to buy a Ford.&quot;  </p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p>&quot;Because they invented the Model T and the process by which all other cars are produced.  They put more into research and development of the Ford, so they need to charge more per car to recoup their investment.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, that makes perfect sense.  How much is this Ford?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It&#39;s 1.4 million dollars.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Are you shitting me?  I can&#39;t afford that!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Sure you can. Your car insurance is going to cover 80%&quot;</p>

<p>Until &quot;health care consumers&quot; - those are people, by the way.  The media doesn&#39;t even call people people in these situations.  Until people stop paying for overpriced care - including hospitalization, prescriptions, etc - things will not change.  The health care industry has no motivation to change because we keep overpaying them like they are doing us a real service.</p>

<p>And they aren&#39;t.  They are lying to you and billing you to do it.  </p>

<p>*I know what&#39;s NOT going to happen.</p>

<p>Everyone realizing their political bullshit is not a team sport. That we all are stressing every day for mostly the same reasons. That we as a collective conscience should stop being angry idiots fighting for a side, blinded by common sense that is right in front of them.</p>

<p>That somehow this huge gap between radical view points in the grand scheme of life is so obviously detremental​ and easily avoidable if everyone that claimed to be a &#39;good person&#39; just let some compassion in for their fellow man. I&#39;m not a preacher or some hippy. I just have no idea why people can&#39;t have a rational adult discussion with one another while avoiding seriously harmful personal attacks on another&#39;s​ character like it doesn&#39;t affect them. The term &#39;troll&#39; is so fucking dumb yet is engrained in society now. It basically means it&#39;s ok to trigger people and be an asshole. To create hated for someone you don&#39;t have a fucking clue about. Everyone acts like they are the good guy and in the same sentence they add in that OTHER people are *insert terrible deeply personal accusation about a person because they read a sentence and it&#39;s different from what they believe in so of course they are wrong&#39;.</p>

<p>So the future will just be more divide more hate more of the things everyone preaches they are against while they are doing the same. fucking. thing. As a whole, the society of developed countries at least could be coming together and proving how much we have evolved. But instead, everyone is letting the politics they claim to dispise rule freedom of individual thought. The past couple years have made me go from a happy goofy guy, to a cynical depressed hermit. I just look at Facebook for 2 seconds and want to vomit. Even people that are &#39;red pilled free thinkers&#39; have alot of bias toward anything that makes them have to engage in good rebuttals to their discussion. It&#39;s just people staunchly kicking their feet and yelling at a brick wall while nothing is accomplished. </p>

<p>So that&#39;s the biggest downfall in my opinion. It&#39;s all of us, it&#39;s the absolute disappearance of heartfelt compassion that allows good debates between us &#39;regular&#39; people that live out all the shittiness that happens in some statistic you see on a spreadsheet. Out of a discussion with both sides trying to understand comes rational thinking, connection and maybe common ground that would spread and be a thing that could stop this fucking soapbox self promoting &#39;gotta get more acceptence in a mouse click!&#39; culture that is a cesspool. </p>

<p>All of us. And I am right there with you guys are just small examples of a system that has infected every inch of society. So fuck it. Stay hateful and watch the world be destroyed by fucking normal people that I bet alot of us would think they are insane but turned out untouchable because they accumulated a man-made product that says &#39;even though I&#39;m a frail 70 year old you could probably kill by patting on the back to hard, somehow people are still so disillusioned they just let me do my thing.. oh sometimes they blog about how I&#39;m Satan but it&#39;s not like anything would happen besides a little ad revenue for them.&#39;</p>

<p>OH LOOK AT THIS BUTTHURT LIBTARD THAT WANTS PEACE! 
OH LOOK AT THIS ALT RIGHT CONSPIRACY NUT THAT THINKS <em>IM</em> THE PROBLEM!</p>

<p>Just shut the fuck up already.</p>

<p>TL;DR - I&#39;ve lost my mind mostly lurking while everyone yells over each other about how the world&#39;s turning to shit when they don&#39;t realize they are a major reason why shit is the way it is.*</p>

<p>It is funny people are attacking me, calling me liberal? If anything, I do not really care about the label. It is so...stupid.</p>

<p>Second, people are arguing with me about this crap. To me, if people cannot even see these fundamental issues, Im not sure what else we can do.</p>

<p>Thank you for your rant because it is much better than I could express myself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know this sub is not a fan of Marx, but the later-Marxists talked about this as well: Unchecked capitalism ends up commodifying EVERYTHING in the search for exchange value. Art, music, cultural features, things that are intangible are transformed into units of commodity. </p>

<p>Take our personal metadata for example, now even THAT is being commodified. Things like our demographic data, our personal search histories (which reflect our thoughts or lifestyles to an extent), those are increasingly commodified to be bought and sold by the people with interest in doing so. Soon, technology will advance even further and our own biometric data might be as well with RFID implants! </p>

<p>And eventually, consciousness itself may be if we become a society of VR-junkies. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Canadian here - the OP&#39;s post is more relevant to Canada than ever!! We are more overworked than ever. The cubicle nation is alive and well here. People have less time to themselves and spend more and more time at work away from family and friends. The Canadian Dollar has crashed, real estate is border line unaffordable, jobs are being lost at a rapid rate. Canada has more consumer debt than America. Kids today are spending way more time online than any previous generation, being raised by social media, pushing off traditional human relationships. Canada was sold out to the major banks and corporations long ago. The problem with most Canadians is that they think they are better of than our American neighbors. </p>

All Western nations are being changed into poor countries with no majority populations but rather nothing but minority populations with no voting power and no commonality.

    <div class="md"><p>I think about these things a lot, maybe it&#39;s because I recently crossed the big 3-0 and feel emptier than ever. Why do we go to work? Does anyone seriously ponder &#39;why we work&#39;? Is waking up early, and rushing through traffic to to the office day in and day out healthy? Is banging out <a href="https://youtu.be/jsLUidiYm0w">TPS Reports</a> the most important thing in your life? No sane person can survive for years on end in a passive aggressive corporate environment - so why do we do it? This kind of lifestyle is literally killing us. Don&#39;t get me wrong - I&#39;m not advocating laziness. What I&#39;m saying is spending a lifetime in a job you hate isn&#39;t doing your health any favors. Once trapped inside the corporate world you start to lose: your ambition, energy, curiosity (is anyone here forced to conform?), creativity, and overall zest for life! I don&#39;t have the answers, but for the first time in my life I&#39;m starting to wake up to theses issues we see all around us....</p>

<p>Consider the popularity of the cinema, the wireless, the football pools and guessing competitions, all devices for soothing fractious infants, no seed of purpose in them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When I discovered the idea that the world was not a globe, from youtube videos, it was almost an instant acceptance for me. I never really put much stock in space, space flight, astronauts, and all that other NASA jazz. The way the information was presented for me it just made sense, logic and reason are key tools as well, on top of that everything that NASA has ever presented is nothing more than drawings/CGI and of course it is a government agency and we know they have a tendency to lie. The NASA mind game is brilliant in my opinion, it&#39;s like the red-headed step child who just wants to go to space and save humanity, but really it&#39;s just another sham. The lack of visual evidence for the shape of our earth is surprisingly absent especially considering the fact that we are supposedly at the top of our game as far as technology is concerned. Seems like it would be simple to put a gopro camera on a rocket and just blast it into space with a live feed. Yet, it is no where too be seen.</p>

<p>Plus, I know the game that our controllers are playing and want to keep slaves as slaves. If the cows figure out how to get out of the pen then all the profits run away as well. Cows are easy to keep locked in, all you have to do is secure the fence line. Humans are not so simple since we can just jump a fence. So what do you do to keep beings that know how to reason locked in? You take away their ability to reason and take away their hope. If we live on a ball floating in space in the middle of nowhere and this is it, taxes and death, then you have successfully enslaved an entire populous. It is in our nature to explore, and when you take the ability to discover out of the hands of the individual and place it in the hands of the story tellers then you are in full control of their destiny.</p>

<p>I am still trying to figure out how we got here, I think the Greeks are the perpetrators of our current calamity. Plato&#39;s cave is very telling, especially given the fact that Plato had slaves. So why would he just imagine the idea of putting people in caves instead of just putting people in caves.</p>

<p>Not even sure if that answers the question, I tend to ramble because I can&#39;t help but see all the connections.</p>

<p>It&#39;s all about your soul, and I&#39;m not even religious.</p>

At the same time, our corporate overlords are giving us cheap products because planned obsolescence is the new standard. Most of us break something and throw it away and buy a new one.

    <div class="md"><p>Amazing post OP! I was reading through some of your past posts as well, and can completely empathize with your statements. I&#39;m also a teacher, and having to put myself in a good mood for the sake of the students is always challenging. It leaves me feeling like I should be honest, but at the same time, I can&#39;t allow myself to make them feel frightened or upset because of the state of affairs worldwide. :/</p>

<p>The question of &quot;what do people live for&quot;, has been one for the history books! Personally, I believe in fate, destiny, opportunity, and karma all existing within our world at the same time. Each individual is wholly connected with one another, yet, we have the ability to ignore that and focus on our own selves, for our own sake. I believe that our own abilities in being able to chose what reality is &quot;true&quot; for us, makes it so things like mental illness (depression, anxiety, ect.) can manifest itself in novel ways. There&#39;s a great article on this - <a href="http://www.esotericscience.org/article16a.htm">http://www.esotericscience.org/article16a.htm</a></p>

<p>&quot;Put simply: destiny is opportunity and fate is karma. We are in control of our destiny but have no control over our fate. Destiny cannot be forced on us; if we are forced then it is our fate. Destiny gives us an opportunity to turn a situation to our advantage and accomplish something great through our own efforts. It is designed to give us the best opportunities for the development of our consciousness, but it is only an outline – not an exact script. It doesn&#39;t detract from our free-will in any way, because we decide exactly how we want to act in any situation.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I tripped balls with this on my mind once and was told by who claimed to be Mother Nature that we are in a time of turmoil because we are basically in labour as a species; giving birth to new way of experiencing. A perspective that would be born from our thoughts, technology. Everything alive on earth is the same consciousness and it&#39;s the will of this collective to do ANYTHING to evolve</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just posted something extremely similar with a new twist. Maybe we can start a movement. </p>

<p>My paper focused on the fact that all of our jobs are useless and probably serve only to produce income for the rich. </p>

<p>For example, chairs produced for workers to sit on to work at call centers using phones purchased from companies, which all use legal documents and paperwork, and there are paper companies, legal companies to keep these companies in check, car companies so the workers can drive, using oil from oil companies who have power to shut down any counter arguments against them. </p>

<p>We should steal money from this companies to fund better things. Chairs don&#39;t need to be made by humans. Use 3D printers. Take the money from chair companies away because at this point they are a detriment to society, with their production wasting away resources and intoxicating the planet and destroying the lives of uncountable future generations, stealing their free will. Since we can prove this, this means these companies aren&#39;t entitled to the free will that harms others. </p>

<p>Vegan food should be free since vegan food is required to feed meat. Meat can cost to reduce demand and reduce environmental issues. </p>

<p>But yeah go read mine, I&#39;ll stop there so I don&#39;t go on too long. </p>

The blockchain is coming to mainstream. It will change the way we interact in the internet. Just take a look at steemit.com. There is no central entity on this social network. It&#39;s more like the community as whole that brings up the discussions about stuff that they want to see. Like a big group project<sup>^</sup></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ugh, man, OP, you hit it all on the head...I&#39;ve been so disparaged lately, literally just crying from the state of the world around me. Just looking up in the sky everyday reminds me how little control I have over my life, as chemtrails litter my blue sky like a fucking checker board. I feel like a tiny ant, just here to consume, work, consume, work, get sick, buy treatments, consume, die, ala &quot;They Live&quot;. I could say so much more, but just thanks for posting, I don&#39;t feel so alone</p>

    <div class="md"><p>get off facebook, it is compromised. if you are still on facebook in 2017 it is probably because you deserve it. improve yourself and stop being dependent upon awful people.</p>

<p>that really is just the key. poisonous, toxic people run off of the esteem of others. stop &quot;liking&quot; sowers of discord. if you are a sower of discord yourself, stop it. if you improve yourself and the people you like turn negative towards you, remove them from your life, they are crabs in a barrel trying to hold you down.</p>

<p>people are afraid to be lonely but cavorting with fools is a wretched existence more base than the loneliest life.</p>

<p>it really is as simple as this: stop putting negative energy out into the world, stop giving positive energy to people who are negative, form positive relationships with good people and the results will astound you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Late but thanks for bringing this up.</p>

<p>I spend a lot of time chasing down these questions. What I&#39;ve primarily ended up at for the moment, as a trigger for many of these issues, is the advent and use of group psychology (only worsened by media and consumerism pressures through the cognitive science revolution).</p>

<p>The early work on crowd psychology &quot;legitimized&quot; that crowds are irrational and should be guided through manipulation of the subconscious (which could be argued - look at the fall of civilizations prior). Many who seek power could easily stop here and gain a lot of capability to mold public opinion; after two or three centuries of this, the narrative of &quot;society&quot; is one that clashes with what individuals know and hold true. Placed in this contrast, we find ourselves, well, upside down.</p>

<p>Theoretically, this power mixed with means of capital allows the &quot;deep state&quot; to manage the narrative of society through managing exposure of information, controlling it through commercial pressures, showing a society that will further depend on that narrative.</p>

<p>I started getting into this stuff with Jung and then Freud, which backed up what I read from Foucault, Chomsky and Zinn. But I didn&#39;t really get it until I looked at Edward Bernays and Le Bon, who spell out crowd psychology - and a narrative of &quot;control is good for people,&quot; which tbh I can&#39;t say it isn&#39;t on some level.</p>

<p>Maybe that all can show more understanding of why things are as they are. I would be more specific to each point and this relation but I am typing on my phone.</p>

I don&#39;t think society should dictate what you can and can&#39;t wear, and whether you need to be feminine or masculine or anything.  Be who you wanna be! </p>

Sociopaths is another word for the &quot;top&quot; people in this category, AKA the very people this sub rails against.

<p>Okay, so any time you make a bigoted statement it&#39;s &quot;hyperbole&quot; I&#39;m sure.  It was a <em>very</em> strange thing to say considering the extensive history of bestiality being compared to same-sex marriage.  I guess all of those bigots were also just being hyperbolic.

    <div class="md"><p>I would say almost all of these problems stem from a major lack of a relationship with G-d.  TV shows and many internet sites just ridicule religion as some archaic thing rather than allowing people to think about the Creator-creation relationship.  TV shows (at least sitcoms I used to watch) often make fun of the people that believe in G-d. </p>

<p>It paints this black and white view of spirituality. Buy in reality we are spiritual beings temporarily in physical bodies in finite world...with an infinite Creator.</p>

<p>There are some very helpful guidelines for all people who chose this path, and the path is paved by the Creator himself.  I feel like most of us a re playing a very complicated game without reading the instructions at all because so many are brainwashed into thinking that the game doesn&#39;t have a designer.</p>

<p>The people have a lot of potential and while there are many people choosing the dark path, the moral path is still available to all, and over the last few years, people definitely have been waking up and switching paths.

<blockquote>
<p>People are exhausted but have no choice but to keep working and working more</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Without strong spirituality, this leads to darkness.  Even with strong spirituality, the weakening of the body can become too much to overcome.  Work, for many people, is not fulfilling either, which adds to the poisonous mix.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Work for the sake of work is valued in our society.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The mainstream media pushes for this as well.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The other day I saw the cashier at Wal-Mart with the energy drink, and I felt for her. Rest and relaxation are becoming more of a rarity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What is also sad is that the cashier is probably not aware how bad energy drinks are for you and/or the cashier simply does not care.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>*Good is only valued if it can be showed off on social media. Good has to be tied to a profit, or a celebrity, or a selfie. Do not forget that you should never feed the homeless on the streets though.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Matthew 6:5</p>

<p>&quot;When you pray, you are not to be like the hypocrites; for they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and on the street corners so that they may be seen by men. Truly I say to you, they have their reward in full.&quot;</p>

<p>Luke 14:13-14</p>

<p>&quot;But when you give a feast, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, the blind, and you will be blessed, because they cannot repay you. For you will be repaid at the resurrection of the just.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Every time I post about this, I get comments on how it is just a tool, and it is how we use it. However, I have to say that it is not only a tool when Facebook admits to purposely manipulating its users.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Some people do not realize the negative effects that social media has on them.  In society, using social media is encouraged a lot more than it is discouraged.  The importance of a human being is being judged by his or her popularity on social media.</p>

<p>Great point about Facebook manipulating their users in the context of that argument.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>*We spend endless amounts of money to go to college and get a degree, only to end up jobless and drowning in debt.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As many of you all know, this is a critical problem facing this generation.  u/polkadotgirl has another outstanding post about how kids are not being prepared for some of the harsh realities of adulthood.  For many, the focus in college is not on education but on having fun and social life.  They can end up with a degree that does not get you into many jobs.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do our children have their childhoods anymore?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Great question.  Imagining a 2nd grader being on the phone all the time is concerning.  Habits stick with us more when they start early in our lives.  Now think about how attached you are to your phone and imagine if you were even more attached to it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>People may have food, but that does not mean they have nutrition.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>People may have healthcare but that does not mean their health is truly cared for when they are prescribed with harmful Big Pharma drugs.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Let&#39;s just say that poor schools are punished for poor performance, and their funding is cut. Wealthy schools are given more money for good performance.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Seems like more than a coincidence that this ends up making poor people depend on the government more.  This system is flawed given the simple example of a school doing poorly due of lack of funding.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The issues in education are endless, but do not worry, because the testing corporations are still making their money!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What a shocker.  The change in the education system enabled corporations to profit more.  I am glad you pointed this out.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is so easy to preach about love, kindness, and compassion for others, but our actions always speak louder than our words.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To preach about that is politically correct, though, so you have to say it even if you don&#39;t do it in practice.  :P</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Who are our role models in increasingly broken homes?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>People in media.  Celebrities, musicians, atheletes, etc.  It used to more commonly be mom, dad, family, and spiritual leader(s).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>All I ever here is &quot;do what you want as long as it makes you happy&quot; but is this really the right way?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If it does not hurt anyone else then it is ok.  Otherwise, I would hope people could come up with a simple scenario to realize the flaws in that ideology.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Materialism, consumerism, and greed. What do people live for? Is there time to think about the existential questions of life?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Worldly things.  Things that do not come with us when we pass on.</p>

<p>The lack of time coupled with the highs of not working and lows of working is one of the main reasons existential questions are not asked.  Or they are answered by emptiness and people have enough of that in their lives already so they try not to think about it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What do you feel the consequences will be?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Shorter attention spans for one.  Some things require a lot of prolonged focus to learn so learning those types of things will be a concern.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The wisdom of the elderly is denied.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is sad because the elderly have wisdom in areas where the new generation will be weak.  They are written off because they may not be tech savvy.  It is important to know how things have changed over a long period of time as well as the knowledge gained from it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>More and more are suffering silenty with anxiety and depression. Mental illness and suicide are on the rise among Americans. But do not worry - one of your friends just posted a status about how great their life is on Facebook!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is profound.  Not only do they feel they need to hide the problem due to social pressure, they are also bombarded with people trying to show off how great their life is.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I feel our society chooses to ignore the &quot;bad&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I agree that most of society does.  Many think, &quot;what can I do about it&quot; as well, which, in turn, causes them to not worry about it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Solace comes for me in the beauty of nature (which is continually being destroyed), the power of words (even if people are increasingly apathetic), and my relationships with others (though I find them harder to maintain as people, at least to me, are increasingly self-absorbed).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I find solace in all of these things as well. I agree with your points in parentheses and find the contrast of the two very profound.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The world feels upside down today, but I am going to work now, and I have to tell my students that they will be okay.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sometimes when I try to come up with a closing sentence, it ends up rhyming for me too.  :)  Not only does this rhyme, but it really hit me emotionally bringing everything you mentioned together and applying it to your teacher/student relationship.</p>

<p>As always, I appreciate you sharing a part of your mind and spirit with us.  :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d add one thing: to the bit about connecting to others on social media. This is the thing, we are not connecting to others, not other humans, but our devices instead. Why people generally have a difficult time making this connection/realizing this, I do not know... it seems just so obvious to me.</p>

<p>And yes, the bit about the charities, the selfies, the &quot;bragging&quot; on social media, etc... You&#39;ve already touched on it well, there&#39;s not much left to say other than it drives me nuts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agreed so much with your post. I have watched our culture devolve through the use of technology. It has become ridiculous. Even in the past 2 years I have seen more of the neighborhood children stay inside and play video games. It is so sad. we have to disconnect and unplug for our sanitizes sake. Because of technology we work longer  and earn less than ever. People just accept it. It baffles me. 
I hate Facebook always have. It&#39;s shallow and the platform is ugly and visually unappealing. I have never understood the appeal to the masses. </p>

<p>School loans: when you buy a house you must prove that you can afford it. With school loans there is no such requirement. Students are being forced to buy an education without the slightest idea if they can afford it. Who goes into debt without an income? It is the equivalent to a loan shark. The schools are complicit they are enslaving our workforce and no matter how much you make your take home income will always be just so. It&#39;s a racket. The best thing I ever did was go cash and forget about the fico score. The control that the credit industry has on us is enslavement. </p>

<p>The education system is a mess and teachers are not only underpaid but also held in low esteem. BUT I also blame teachers. They choose not to change the system from within. They simply follow orders accept whatever nonsense the administration orders and instead of enlisting the voices of the parents and the children to demand change, no the majority of teachers are complicit and sheeple. I have come to the conclusion that sheeple are dangerous. I used to be a teacher and loved it. when common core took over I was shocked at how many teachers supported it. So many teachers are letting themselves get replaced by robots through their free use of technology. It&#39;s insanity. The world is upside down. The mentally ill psychopaths are running it. The population is enslaved yet they think they are free. We accept lies and corruption from our politicians whe. We should be literally knocking on their doors demanding they keep their committments. Yet we the public must come to work every day on time if we get sick we get fired and lose out health insurance. Yikes! 
Is it me or has anyone noticed that the culture has grown meaner lately. When I was younger if someone would get fired we would collect money for that person. Nowadays the coworkers make fun of the fired or laid off person. It&#39;s so strange to me where did this mean spirit come from?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For some reason they view parents as an annoyance instead of partners. I hear so much complaining about the administration taking away nap time from kindergarten for example, and parents complaining but no one works together. It&#39;s an us against them mentality. Teachers have a lot of influence, but for some reason they don&#39;t use it. They are underpaid and unappreciated but they need to enlist the parents to demand better. Why don&#39;t they? . I remeber when homeschoolers were the weirdos now I see it as admirable. </p>

Works great.  Usually the formula is a few oranges (I use 3 or 4 because I like a really fruity taste), probably half a small bottle of coconut water, and the rest water, with some ice cubes too to keep it cold or from getting too hot.  A pinch of salt and a little bit of lemon juice (sometimes i add lime juice too) and it works just fine.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s still done. For example, it&#39;s done by advertisers who target children, so that they can instill narratives of consumerism into them, while they&#39;re impressionable and formulating their place in the world. </p>

It&#39;s a distraction to keep everyone busy while they prepare some sort of world changing announcement. Either we&#39;ve achieved world peace through technology and diplomacy, or Aliens are real. Free energy becomes a thing for the whole planet? The Egyptian Gods were real and they&#39;re back? I can&#39;t remember it&#39;s fuzzy.</p>

<p>(none of these felt like dreams...they felt more like my self was inside my body further along in time, riding as an observer. like everything was real, rather than surreal)</p>

It seems reasonable enough that any time you&#39;re spending on your device(s) is time you&#39;re spending WITH YOUR DEVICE and it&#39;s &quot;information&quot;. It&#39;s impersonal, it lacks in human contact, connection, etc. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry for the delayed response to your very detailed and thought out post.  With my ADHD I quit my meds against everyone&#39;s wishes at 24 because I felt like a zombie. And again they still wanted me on 4-5 dexadrine a day at that time which was nuts. I graduated with a 3.5 GPA even though I literally never studied, had a successful military then state corrections career (until being Injured on the job in both) so I don&#39;t feel like my ADHD has ever held me back in life. The unique perspective I gain from life is worth the struggles I&#39;ve faced IMO.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are a lot of people that don&#39;t try to develop that relationship with G-d, so the &quot;face/countenance&quot; of G-d is turned away, just as a father will turn away from his son after the son disobeys the moral rules that strengthen the foundation of the entire household.  </p>

<p>The people have a lot of potential and while there are many people choosing the dark path, the moral path is still available to all, and over the last few years, people definitely have been waking up and switching paths.  It isn&#39;t something that happens overnight, but it is one of our main purposes for existence.</p>

<p>There is always hope.  The message and the Truth will spread.  Those with hope and dedication must take the torch and enlighten the path.  </p>

<p>I&#39;ve never personally used it, but I think asknoah.com is probably a good place for people that want the purest form of an instruction manual for life and happiness.</p>
