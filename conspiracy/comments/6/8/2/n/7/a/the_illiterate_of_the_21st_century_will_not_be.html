    <div class="md"><p>Um, sometemes parts of meteors reentry, but most of them burn up in the atmosphere just like a man made object would. And then they crash at high speed because reentry does not slow you down that much, especially not down to a speed where it possible to deploy a chute.</p>

<p>But the most impossible thing with reentry is that they claim that a capsule shaped like Apollo would be able to be stable entering the atmosphere at 30000 km/h. I just cannot happen. Imagine a Apollo capsule shout out over a lake at high speed. What happens when the capsule touches the water? Same thing would happen if you try enter the atmosphere from the vaccum of space at 30000 kmph</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Some parts enter, some don&#39;t</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, it ablates. That&#39;s a crude way to describe an ablative heat shield. A man-made ablative shield is also engineered to not break up on reentry, unlike say a meteor.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They crash at high speeds because reentry doesn&#39;t slow you down that much</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Or rather, they don&#39;t slow down a big rock because the meteor is dense all the way through and has an irregular shape. A capsule, shuttle or any man-made object designed to reenter is:</p>

<ol>
<li>Probably pressurized (though it doesn&#39;t have to be</li>
<li>Probably light (compared to a big rock)</li>
</ol>

<p>So they slow down much more rapidly. Also you will have to source that.</p>

<p>Water does not have the properties of air, and a lake that is, what, 50 meter deep, is not a good analogy for the atmosphere.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I beg to differ. I think comparing hitting a waterbody at high speed on earth is a pretty reasonable analogy to what would happen if you tried to enter the atmosphere from an earth parking orbit in which you need to have a speed at about 30000 kph to stay in orbit. And even if the effect would be slightly softer you still would enter a violent spin. Something shaped like the Apollo capsule is not stable, but then again nothing can be stable in near vacuum, and one side of the ship would come in contact with the upper atmosphere first sending the ship into a irrecoverable tumble. Rudder or corrective rockets would not help at that hight, not that the Apollo capsules had any.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>It isn&#39;t. For one, air is a gas, and water is a liquid. The cohesion between the molecules miles apart. Both air and liquid flows around the body, but while a plane CAN go supersonic, a submarine can&#39;t.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the atmospheric density increases slowly from approximately 0 atm. to 1 atm. over a distance of about 120 km. This is completely different from hitting a liquid waterbody, which would have a very limited amount of density. It would be like hitting a brick wall, vs hitting an ever increasing amount of oxygen molecules and whatever other gasses.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You would still enter a violent spin.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can easily make a capsule stable in the air stream. Concentrate the mass up front, and make it so that any &quot;delta-thrust&quot; applied in one direction is countered by another. It&#39;s aerodynamically stable by the book.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Apollo capsule isn&#39;t stable</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We are again assuming you own a replica and have run several reentry tests?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>One side would come into contact and send it into a tumble</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No it would not. It could be very close to tipping, but the center of mass being further forwards would push the capsule back into position. The airstream around it would not allow it to ever enter a tumble, because of the principles of aerodynamics. Sure, it can in theory become completely irrecoverable, just like an airplane CAN stall. But you would have to start the tumble high up on purpose, and if luck is on your side, you can still recover. See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soyuz_5#Mission_highlights">this</a> story how a Soyuz capsule which entered the wrong way, managed to flip around because the unintended parts broke off and the aerodynamic characteristics made it stable.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Nothing can be stable in a near vacuum.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not aerodynamically, no, but you have RCS for that exact purpose.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Rudder or corrective rockets would not help at that height</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What height? Upper atmosphere and vaccuum, RCS did the job fine. This is not so important when your reentry is more or less ballistic (Apollo wasn&#39;t, it was a skip reentry), and more important on fixed wing like the Shuttle. Later on, the RCS would be used for rotation around the Y-axis, and offset mass controlled the rate of reentry.</p>

I don&#39;t find that plausible. Look at the two persons that made an parachute jump from extreme height. Both got into an irrecoverable spin and skilled parachute jumpers are very good at cancelling spin.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And regarding comparing to enter water at high speed I agree water has very different density but I still think it&#39;s a valid thought experiment considering the insane speed you have in earth orbit. There&#39;s no way anything could re-entry without starting to spin violently.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve looked at the Lunar Landings and manned space travel extensively and my conclusion is that it&#39;s all lies. It not a few pieces of anomalies. It&#39;s a truckload from every angle you look at it. Here&#39;s some gems regarding re-entry:

<p>Of course I base myself on the NASA story. You try to counter NASA, so I will have to back them up with the information they present. But this is also basic aerodynamics. Center of Mass in front of Center of Lift always applies when some lift and drag are generated, and reentry does just that.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Yes it did: <a href="https://history.nasa.gov/afj/aoh/aoh-v1-2-05-rcs.pdf">Page 2</a></p>

<p>I think this the essence of the different views we have on this. NASA and it&#39;s backers will of course never give you any reason to question the Moon Landings or manned space travel the same way as a church will not give you reason to doubt the existence of their God.</p>

<p>But if you would be able to look at the numerous criticisms of NASAs own material you would find that it just doesn&#39;t add up. Not in one or a few ways, but in almost every conceivable way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nice. Only tackling that and nothing else. Part of me wanted to add that just to see if you&#39;d react.</p>

<p>I have read the &quot;criticism&quot; before, and I have looked at the &quot;not-criticism&quot; (footage from NASA I guess), and the story still holds. I calculated the delta-v budget by hand, and it made sense. I&#39;ve looked at the various shadows, VA belts and what have you, and the explanations still made sense. What else do you want me to do? Read yet more stuff?</p>

<p>But lecture me on how NASA somehow fucks up in every conceivable way.</p>

<p>No I won&#39;t and it wouldn&#39;t change anything. If investigating space travel and discussing it with people has tought me one thing it that our core beliefs, for example that NASA and the government would never get away with lying about this, cannot be changed by facts with most people. And you have all the facts you need already at Aulis at r/moonhoax and several other places.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cool, and I don&#39;t mean to preach meat eating either. But if there&#39;s one thing I&#39;ve learned from looking into nutrition, it&#39;s that animal fat is essential to us and that we should avoid grains and sugar. So vegan  with lots of butter is pretty much the ideal diet :)</p>

<p>There is some research into blood types and diets and I believe there are a couple blood types who have a near impossible time with a vegan diet. Take this all with a grain of salt and educate yourselves.</p>
