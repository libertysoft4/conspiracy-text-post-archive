        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Alright. I already know what you all are gonna say. Im stupid for believing earth is flat. But how am i stupid? or an idiot? or whatever yall gonna call me. you believe what the scientists tell you. Im starting to think Hitler was onto something, &quot;Make the lie big, make it simple, keep saying it, and eventually everyone will believe&quot;. 
1. &quot;make the lie big&quot; - the earth is actually a sphere and we are not in the center
2. &quot;make it simple&quot; - almost everyone will say that Gravity is proof, that it pulls everything towards the center. Also, there is proof that Nasa has pictures of the earth where clouds are EXACTLY the same and just in a different place, kind of like copy and pasting, or they made clouds in a program and pasted it in the picture. When asked for proof that earth is round, many people say &quot;Well if earth is flat, why dont we fall off&quot;. That is not an answer. 
3. keep on saying it - everyone is taught in school that earth is spherical, therefore we are raised to believe soemthing that we have for a fact never saw with our own eyes. </p>

<p>alright, so im gonna talk about gravity first. Gravity is believed to be pulling everything downward, toward the center. but what if it only pulls things down. that would explain why things go down, as they would be the same motion on both theories. You might say that it does not make sense, but think how does gravity make sense ? how is there this force that magically appears once something is big enough. Why does gravity exist. how is there this force between EVERYTHING in the universe. it does not make sense at all. Once you can prove that it is 100% gravity, and there is no chance, not even a (1 x 10<sup>-1000000000000000)</sup> % chance that it could be soemthing, i will believe the earth is a sphere. 
Second, very very few people have been to Antarctica. &quot;Why dont you fall off the edge if earth is flat. So what the perimeter of earth, is a giant ice wall. and alaska or the north part of the globe is actually just the perimeter of earth. <a href="https://www.theflatearthsociety.org/forum/index.php?topic=60894.0">https://www.theflatearthsociety.org/forum/index.php?topic=60894.0</a> (link for a better explanation 
Third, we could POSSIBLY be living in a geocentric universe. We could actually be in the center. If we were in the center, then that must mean someone put us here, God. The bible even states Job 38:14 &quot;The earth takes shape like clay under a seal; its features stand out like those of a garment.&quot;. this says that earth is the shape of clay ( think of molding clay) under a SEAL ( a seal is a ring that has a circle for its mainpart, like where a diamond would go, but its a flat circle). So if you were to take the ring, and press down with it onto clay, it will make circle have a &quot;border-like&quot; diameter. This supports my consideration that earth is flat and surrounded by a border, alsaka or the north , or the ice wall i was talking about. So this verse, as wel as many other verses, states that earth is flat, as it is compared to clay under a seal (ring). also, revelation 20-7-9 talks about Satan and the people battling it out on &quot;the breadth of the earth&quot;. Breadth translated to greek is &quot;platos&quot; which means width, or overall just FLAT. so satan will rise to the width if the earth and battle. 
I also have some support that will make you think that the bible could possibly be real. 
(this next part im about to type doesnt relate to earth being flat, just backs up my claim that the bible could be real). 
Alright so have you ever heard of the four horsemen of the apocalypse? There is a Red, White, Black, and &quot;pale&quot; horsemen. Why are three horsemen colors and one is &quot;pale&quot;. Pale in greek translates to &quot;chloros&quot; which means green, or pale. when translating from greek to english, they thought it must be a Pale Horse because they never saw a green horse. Well it actually should say the Green Horse, which is the rider of death. It says the the Green Horse has authority of one quarter of the earth. Well now you know that its the Green Horse. Islam&#39;s sacred color is green. And islam accounts for about 25% of the population (about 23% actually, but its not gonna be perfect). Do you think that this is just a coincidence? really? The bible also states that they will kill with swords, as does ISIS does alot of killings with beheadings or slicing the throat. 
This is just my belief that the bible is true. like how is soemthing like this a coincidence. please explain. </p>

<p>Another bible verse that supports me is Psalm 19:4-6   it says that the sun moves in a circuit, or revolution, A CIRCLE PEOPLE!!!!! And what if the sun isnt as bright as we think? what if it only covers only a seperate part of the circle of earth at once. Also there are photos where it appears to be clouds behind the sun, as there would be if earths flat. simply just look it up. or go to the flat earth society website. </p>

<p>What if we really do live on a flat earth, and heaven is above us and hell is below us. what if we live in a &quot;dome&quot; and there might not be anything out there. regular citizens dont have any proof that earth isnt flat. They have resources they think they can trust, they have the government that could be lying to us, and all the sources they want, but they never actually saw the earth as a sphere. It could all be fake, it could all be true. but we will never know unless we for ourselves, every single person, goes into space ourselves. and just think, you know how easy it is to photoshop? to create fake &quot;live&quot; broadcasts? or even photos of planets or the moon. </p>

<p>Ill make an edit if i think of any other supporting evidence i have, because its 530am and my brain is friend. 
ALL I AM ASKING IS DONT JUDGE ME OR OTHER PEOPLE FOR TAKING THIS INTO CONSIDERATION. REALLY DO THINK ABOUT IT AND IF YOU WANT, RESEARCH IT. theres really good youtube vids. whatever doubts you have, look it up and there will be an explanation. 
If you have any questions or wanna discuss anything about this message me. this really is a good topic to talk about. </p>

<p>I might have confused the Alaska / north claims with Antartica. </p>

<p>AS I SAID BEFORE. DONT START SAYING IM ANOTHER PERSON TRYING TO CONTRADICT SCIENCE. no , im just really amazed that a whole society believes this. And everything i am saying that supports this theory is just stuff i saw in videos. i just wonder iff it could actually be possible. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The opposite is also true. Polaris, the southern star, is visible in Sydney and not NY. </p>

<p>Actually Polaris being seen in the same spot from Australia, Southern Africa, and South America doesn&#39;t work with the flat Earth map. According to them directly South from each of those places is a totally different point in space separated by thousands of miles. Polaris cannot exist in the Flat Earth model. </p>

<p>Firstly, if you do believe it and this isn&#39;t part of the psy-op to discredit this sub: starting off with &quot;I think Hitler was on to something&quot; is never a way to open discussion with any one. Regardless of what your beliefs are on Hitler, which there are interesting accounts and stories, I don&#39;t personally believe either side and think the truth lies in the middle, you immediately will activate a rejection because of cognitive dissonance. </p>

<p>Secondly Hitler never said that one of his generals did.</p>

<p>All this stuff confuses me, and I believe that the truth is probably somewhere in the middle with everything in life. But with NASA and space, no matter what they tell us, it&#39;s so we somehow don&#39;t figure out there&#39;s a high orbit military base up there. That I feel sure of. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>lol no. some people say that it is about the same distance away as the moon, and it is smaller than we think. all we can do is believe what NASA and other space programs release. look at the pictures of earth taken from outer space. the continents are different sizes in proportion to the size of the earth, and a NASA worker even said it is photoshopped, and he adds color to the sea and he erases the clouds then puts them back in. </p>

<p>Do you believe in God? If you do, you were probably raised believing there is a God. And say someone comes up to you and says there is no God, here is my evidence. Yet you still deny there is not God, so you believe there is a God. That is what is happening here. your only supporting evidence os that, quote on quote, &quot;Flat eathers are fucking idiots that deny the evidence that doesnt suit them&quot;. So therefore your saying no G/god is real. Dont be a dick just because people have their own opinion. people like you are the real assholes. foh</p>

<p>that the elites didnt make up this</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So the &quot;elites&quot; started 300 BC when they mathematically showed a heliocentric universe and a spherical Earth, mind you, centuries before Christianity even existed?</p>

<p>I just have to ask what the precise goal of these &quot;elites&quot; are.  And I assume &quot;elites&quot; is code for &quot;nerds who do math and other weird things&quot;.  I mean, I&#39;m all for follow the money, but there was mostly not a lot of money and power in challenging religious superstition that the moon is made of cheese and the oceans spill out into the ether.</p>

<p>So what&#39;s the motivation of this group of, apparently millions of people to claim something that, apparently, also works enough that any country with a basic space program can utilize it successfully?  I mean, any country with ballistic missile technology seems to waste an awful lot of money using a spherical earth to strategic murdering one another.  Because that&#39;s all that&#39;s left after some fairly easily understood math can be drawn out by Iron Age astrologers is for flat earth believers to show how they&#39;re wrong.</p>

<p>Also, the moon doesn&#39;t cover the Sun entirely, you still have a corona, which is why you see that nice ring around it, and it blinds you when you stare at it.  If it covered it you wouldn&#39;t even see a sun.  It mostly covers it, which means it&#39;s imperfect, i.e. not magical, so it&#39;s just a nice coincidence, if it was magical it would be perfect.  But what it does do is show the sun is further away than the moon, which means to support the sun being close argument, you have to support the moon being close as well.</p>

<p>And since we&#39;re speaking of moons and gravity, how does the flat earth handle tides?  They occur very predictably world wide in sync with the moon, which apparently orbits a sphere, and drags the oceans around with it.</p>

<p>The gravitational attraction of the moon causes the oceans to bulge out in the direction of the moon. Another bulge occurs on the opposite side, since the Earth is also being pulled toward the moon (and away from the water on the far side). ... Since the earth is rotating while this is happening, two tides occur each day.</p>

<p>How does a flat earth handle tides, the moon, and the measurable increases and decreases in the tides as supported by a spherical planet.</p>

<p>Also, I gave detailed instructions on how to prove the Earth is a sphere.  I have yet to see any argument, scientific or &quot;made-up-nonsense that would discount it, not without making up more assertions such as &quot;the sun is like 5&#39; away, that&#39;s why shadows look different&quot;, which would require some degree of proof on the flat side.</p>

<p>Nothing you have posted is evidence of a flat earth.</p>

<p>You disregard everything the &quot;scientists&quot; say, as if they&#39;re a giant, multi million member cult hell bent on convincing you that the earth is round (because... ?????), yet you will gladly accept the ramblings of a few brain-dead, basement dwelling youtubers as fact, even though they contradict all modern science </p>

<p>I will continue to judge people like you, because you all demonstrate that you are incapable of thinking rationally. You all say &quot;do research, do some experiments&quot;. Sitting on your ass watching batshit insane youtube videos is not research, and not one of you has actually done any experiments, as if you had, you would have discovered the earth is not flat (and no, pointing your iPhone camera at the horizon is not an experiment. </p>

The planets revolve around the sun, and the solar system revolves around a larger axis, a 26,000 year trip around the galaxy.</p>

<p>Why does the railroad have to compensate for the curvature of the Earth? They lay track according to the local geography. If they can lay a straight track they do.

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;One surveyor, Mr. T. Westwood, wrote into the January, 1896 “Earth Review” magazine stating that, “In leveling, I work from Ordinance marks, or canal levels, to get the height above sea level.  The puzzle to me used to be, that over several miles each level was and is treated throughout its whole length as the same level from end to end; not the least allowance being made for curvature.  One of the civil engineers in this district, after some amount of argument on each side as to the reason why no allowance for curvature was made, said he did not believe anybody would know the shape of the earth in this life.” &quot;</p>

<p>The definition of &quot;level&quot; is a line perpendicular to gravity. As gravity always points to the center of mass, on a sphere gravity will not be pointing in the same direction. This means a &quot;level line&quot; on earth will not be a straight line, but will follow the curvature of the earth.</p>

<p>If that line is always the same distance from the center of earth, it will be the same level line, even though it circles the planet.</p>

<p>This surveyor you talk about may not understand that simple concept, but that doesn&#39;t mean it is not true.</p>

<p>Water is always going to find it&#39;s own balance against gravity and maintain a particular level across its surface. The water simply curves right along with the planet.</p>

<p>Gravity is believed to be pulling everything downward, toward the center. but what if it only pulls things down. that would explain why things go down, as they would be the same motion on both theories. You might say that it does not make sense, but think how does gravity make sense ? how is there this force that magically appears once something is big enough. Why does gravity exist. how is there this force between EVERYTHING in the universe. it does not make sense at all.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, gravity is just the name given to &quot;curved space-time&quot;. Every mass, no matter how small, curves space-time. This curvature is what we perceive as a &quot;force&quot; pulling us toward the center of a mass.</p>

<p>A way to think of it is to imagine a thin, very stretchy, rubber sheet with different sized ball bearings on it. A ball bearing the size of a bowling ball will stretch the rubber sheet downwards creating a conical indentation. If you place a small ball bearing the size of a marble on the edge of that indentation, that ball bearing will fall down into the indentation towards the larger one. It will look like the larger ball bearing is pulling the smaller one down, but in reality they are both &quot;falling&quot; into the indentation.</p>

<p>That&#39;s how science explains gravity. There is no &quot;force&quot; between the two ball bearings, they are both &quot;falling&quot; into curvatures in space-time created by the presence of their mass.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Once you can prove that it is 100% gravity, and there is no chance, not even a (1 x 10-1000000000000000) % chance that it could be soemthing, i will believe the earth is a sphere.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ll turn that around on you... how about you try to describe any other mechanism for what we call gravity? There is no doubt at all that what we call gravity exists. So what is <em>your</em> explanation for it?</p>

<p>If you can&#39;t explain it without referring to magic, then we&#39;ll just have to assume that the current theory is correct.</p>

<p>And what if it&#39;s not? You have zero evidence for the existence of this ice wall, and I have plenty of evidence that it doesn&#39;t exist. No one has ever claimed to have seen the ice wall you&#39;re talking about. There are no images of it. Nothing. Even if I accept the possibility that the evidence I have is faked, that still does not provide evidence for your theory.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Nope. When the church was murdering people for claiming the earth was not the center of the universe, it commissioned its own scientists to prove the &quot;geocentric universe&quot;. They failed. Why? Because everything we observe around us contradicts the theory.</p>

<p>Well, I&#39;ll give you that... Science says the sun does move in a circle... around the Milky Way galaxy. We move around the sun, the sun moves around the galaxy, the galaxy moves through intergalactic space. That&#39;s the universe as explained by science.

<p>Not only that, there is the problem of gravity. Gravity ALWAYS pulls towards the center of mass of an object. Doesn&#39;t matter what the shape is. It ALWAYS pulls towards the center. This is backed by a TON of experimental evidence and math. </p>

<p>If the Earth were a disc, gravity would still pull towards the center. Which means, if you were to walk out to the edge of the disc, gravity would be pulling you <em>sideways, along the ground</em>. The further south you went, the harder gravity would pull sideways. Anything near the North Pole (including Greenland, Canada, and Russia) would be tens of thousands of feet underwater because the same rules would apply to seawater. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In your model the sun would always be visible or if you don&#39;t think that is true for whatever reason you must concede it would change size noticeably as it moved relative to your position on the flat surface. Might I suggest you visit a public astronomy observatory to examine this conspiracy up close, perhaps you will meet people who are in on it and are actively lying to you about the shape of the solar system for their paymasters the spherical earth scammers who stand to profit and gain from this immense lie.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>lmao i got general education in high school , as i am still in high school. but that does not have anything to do with how intelligent i am. I am simply giving information that i gathered and seeing what other people think. i am not living my life by it. i honestly believe the earth is a sphere. but you never know. a whole society believes this , as well as Kyrie Irving. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>yet the belief of earth being flat goes way back before any had a clue or evidence that earth is spherical. lmao come one man, try harder to counter this argument rather than trying to be a smart ass and end up looking like a dumbass. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My explanation for a flat earth is that there is no gravity, but it is simply just a thing called DENSITY. If thats so hard for you to take into consideration, why was it so easy for you to believe Gravity is real, yet there is no way to prove it exists. there is no way to prove that it is DENSITY also, unless we go see for ourselves what earth looks like and stop listening to what NASA, who had an employee say they photoshop images of earth, tell you. </p>
