    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know why I&#39;m posting in this sub, but screw it:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>No software to support it </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s had several iterations of software released and the final software is estimated to arrive around November.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Runs slower and turns slower than the old f-16 planes</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Only in unrealistic circumstances where the F-16 is essentially stripped clean. Besides that, combat today isn&#39;t about who has the more agile plane, it&#39;s primarily about detecting and being able to engage your enemy with missiles (that can turn far tighter than any fighter) while denying your enemy that opportunity; this has been a very clear and worldwide trend for the past 50 years - the base concepts of avoiding dogfights and instead ambushing enemy aircraft has even been the fighter ace&#39;s most effective tactic since WW1.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Cannot fly in rain or harsh sunlight</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Rubbish, they&#39;ve even flown on/off of aircraft carriers while in the rain and the main base of F-35 operations is in Arizona.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Heavier and can be easily outmaneuvered by F-16 planes</p>
</blockquote>

<p>See #2.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Flies blind and relies on satellite to guide itself</p>
</blockquote>

<p>About as far from the truth as possible - the F-35 has a wider and more powerful set of sensors than any other fighter out there.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Has &quot;stealth&quot; which is easily counterable by chinese and russian radars</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Stealth isn&#39;t binary and the radars you&#39;re talking about can&#39;t be used to provide missile locks.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Leaks oil and bursts in flame</p>
</blockquote>

<p>All planes leak oil (and the F-35 uses far fewer hydraulics than previous jets; it powers self-contained systems with electricity rather than aircraft-wide hydraulic loops) and it&#39;s had a better safety record than pretty much any fighter in service - it&#39;s had one aircraft lost in 11 years of flying; the F-16 you were talking about had about 140 crashes in its first 11 years.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Has a helmet that allows it to see 360 degrees, but it&#39;s so heavy that the pilot cannot see the rearside properly</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Pilots just had to learn to change their habits / technique; the issue also had nothing to do with weight, but rather the size of the seat headrest. There was an ejection risk associated with helmet weight (where pilots that weighed &lt;136lb were physiologically susceptible to breaking their necks during parachute opening, after ejection), but they&#39;ve already brought out a version of the helmet that&#39;s even lighter than peer helmets like the JHMCS.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Underpowered</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It has the most powerful engine ever put into a fighter; it accelerates as fast as an F-22 at subsonic speeds and has a thrust-to-weight ratio that beats other jets like the Super Hornet.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Has jamming systems that makes it easily noticable</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Jamming systems are largely for when you&#39;ve already been noticed; they&#39;re only turned on when the pilot wants them to be.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>it costs over 1.5 trillion dollars to develop</p>
</blockquote>

<p>$55 billion; $1.5 trillion is a wishy-washy estimate that includes R&amp;D, production of 2457 aircraft through to 2038 and their maintenance, fuel, spare parts, contractor services, etc through to the year 2070, with all of these costs including inflation. Per-plane it&#39;s cheaper than most western fighters on the market; it&#39;s half the price of an F-22.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And we will be using it as our only aerial superpower in world war iii since Lockheed Martin has decided to use it to replace 90% of us aircraft!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lockheed doesn&#39;t choose what planes it replaces and it&#39;s not replacing 90% of aircraft; there&#39;ll still be hundreds of F/A-18s, F-15s and F-22s around until around 2040, as well as hundreds of F-16s for the next ~15 years. European nations will also still continue to use the Typhoon, Rafale, Gripen, etc alongside the F-35.</p>

<p>it&#39;s primarily about detecting and being able to engage your enemy with missiles (that can turn far tighter than any fighter) while denying your enemy that opportunity;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How do you detect the enemy without turning on a radar? How do you remain &quot;invisible&quot; while blasting radar all over the place?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the base concepts of avoiding dogfights and instead ambushing enemy aircraft has even been the fighter ace&#39;s most effective tactic since WW1.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bullshit. When the F-4 Phantom II was first built, no provision was made for a gun, because the air force said the same thing. It was all going to be long range missile fights. Then they got to Vietnam and F-4s were dropping like flies because they couldn&#39;t dogfight the Vietnamese jets and their missiles were nowhere near as effective in combat as they had been in training. Then the F-4 got a gun.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy_Strike_Fighter_Tactics_Instructor_program#Genesis">&quot;Topgun&quot;</a> was was established specifically because Vietnam exposed the US&#39; weakness when it came to dogfighting.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Stealth isn&#39;t binary and the radars you&#39;re talking about can&#39;t be used to provide missile locks.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They don&#39;t need to. Stealth only works by reducing radar cross section. If you know where an aircraft is, you can fire an active homing missile in the general direction and rely on the missile&#39;s radar to acquire and track the target once it gets within striking distance.</p>

<p>The poor maneuverability of the F-35 makes such attacks more likely to be successful.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>it&#39;s had one aircraft lost in 11 years of flying; the F-16 you were talking about had about 140 crashes in its first 11 years</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How many F-35&#39;s have actually been flying in that 11 years?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It has the most powerful engine ever put into a fighter; it accelerates as fast as an F-22 at subsonic speeds and has a thrust-to-weight ratio that beats other jets like the Super Hornet.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The max takeoff weight of an F-16 is 42,300 lb while its dry thrust is 17,155 lbf. The max takeoff weight of the F-35 is 70,000 lb while its dry thrust is 28,000 lbf.</p>

<p>The F-35 is heavier than an F-16 when <em>empty</em> - 49,540 lb - than the F-16 at max takeoff weight.</p>

<p>This means the F-16 has a thrust to weight ratio of 1.24 with 50% internal fuel, while the F-35 has a thrust to weight ratio of 1.07 with 50% fuel.</p>

<p>The F-35 needs a much more powerful engine just to get its fat ass off the ground.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Jamming systems are largely for when you&#39;ve already been noticed; they&#39;re only turned on when the pilot wants them to be.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can hide or you can fight. You can&#39;t do both. As soon as an F-35 enters into an air engagement, its stealth goes out the window.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>You can use LPI radar modes; it&#39;s unlikely to work against something like a PAK-FA, but against MiG-29s, Su-27s, Su-30s, etc it allows you to use your radar to see them without them detecting you.</p></li>
<li><p>The F-35 has passive radar, as well as IRSTs. Combined with MADL and the sensors on other F-35s you can triangulate enemy positions in 3D space.</p></li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
<p>When the F-4 Phantom II</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I literally have a macro for this:</p>

<p>When F-4&#39;s were getting shot out of the sky, the US Navy and USAF took 2 different approaches.</p>

<p>The USAF added guns to their F-4s, at the expense of a smaller radar dish.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.pacificaviationmuseum.org/pearl-harbor-blog/the-f-4c-phantom-ii">The US Navy didn&#39;t bother adding a gun to their F-4s</a>, <a href="http://www.sandiegomagazine.com/San-Diego-Magazine/October-2009/Top-Gun-40-Years-of-Higher-Learning/">but instead implemented a training program which focused on the maintenance of missiles and their implementation in combat. The end result of that was Topgun.</a> </p>

<p>For the USAF, their kill-to-loss ratio actually decreased over time.</p>

<p>For the Navy, their kill-to-loss ratio skyrocketed from 2:1 to 13:1.</p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/ZX54d7U.png">And even for those kills that the USAF Phantoms did achieve, the majority were still performed via air-to-air missiles.</a></p>

<hr/>

<p>Even besides that, what relevance does this have? When I talk about WW1, etc aces not getting into dogfights, I&#39;m talking about them not trying to out-turn the enemy. The great aces like Oswald Boelcke, Edward Mannock, Erich Hartmann, Gerd Barkhorn, Richard Bong and Tommy McGuire all used ambush / &#39;boom and zoom&#39; tactics of getting up high, spotting an enemy, diving at them (ideally from the sun to stay hidden), engaging them with guns, then swooping back up to see if they killed them and to deny the enemy the chance to fight back. </p>

<p>Getting into a merge and trying to outmanoeuvre your enemy just makes you fish in a barrel for any other enemy in the sky (of which there are generally quite a few).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>you can fire an active homing missile in the general direction</p>
</blockquote>

<p>F-15s with their large APG-63s have struggled to lock onto F-22s while in dogfighting range; how well do you think a little 10-20cm wide X-band dish on a missile will perform?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The poor maneuverability of the F-35</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/2016/08/operational-assessment-of-the-f-35a-argues-for-full-program-procurement-and-concurrent-development-process">F-35 pilots prefer it in most types of dogfight over their previous jets.</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>How many F-35&#39;s have actually been flying in that 11 years?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There&#39;s more than 220 flying today.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The F-35 is heavier when empty - 49,540 lb - than the F-16 at max takeoff weight.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The F-35A is 29,000lb when empty, not 49,540lb. Its engine also produces about double that of an F-16&#39;s and the F-35 often has less drag due to everything being internal.</p>

<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-GD717U83eQY/VOpbs8ImHAI/AAAAAAAADGQ/3o1qFz3y47c/s1600/F-16-DI-132.jpg">This is what an F-16C with a drag index (DI; a unitless number used in flight manuals to figure out performance) of 132 looks like.</a> <a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-AiHCYrgVCrI/VOpjeRjjssI/AAAAAAAADGw/3f_hDDIhdvs/s1600/F-35A-beats-all-but-lightest-and-slickest-F-16Cs.jpg">This is how the F-35A stacks up against the F-16C with a DI of just 100.</a></p>

<p>Another thing you&#39;re not factoring in too is the range / fuel discrepancy - an F-35A with 50% fuel flies roughly twice as far as an F-16C with 50% fuel; a more reasonable comparison would be 25% vs 50%, etc, in which case the F-35 still has a lower T:W, but only barely, and in comparison to a jet that&#39;s renowned for being a rocket with wings.</p>

<p>Also, I&#39;m not sure why you&#39;re comparing dry thrust; if you&#39;re trying to accelerate, particularly in combat, you&#39;re almost certainly using afterburner.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You can hide or you can fight. You can&#39;t do both. </p>

<p>The F-22 and F-35&#39;s performance at things like Red Flag, Northern Edge (and for the Raptor, IRL with intercepts of Iranian F-4s, etc) would like a word with you.</p>

As an addition to the above, it&#39;s nothing more than propaganda.  I&#39;ve had the pleasure of meeting many of the F-35&#39;s pilots, including the first squadron to receive it. The pilots have been very open about the fighter jet, their opinions of it, its capability, and the obvious and blatant use of shit talking in regards to its development and application. Essentially its all a tactic. They want people to think it&#39;s crap. Or rather, they want &quot;others&quot; to think it&#39;s crap. If you go back and research other technological / military projects, you&#39;ll find that its a tactic that&#39;s been played out time, and time again. Everything you hear is absolute horseshit. But again, this is just through the experience of meeting and being able to talk with these pilots. Take it for what you will. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>No software to support it</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Frankly I don&#39;t even know what this means so I don&#39;t know how to address it. Sounds like something you made up.</p>

<p>Its software is written and developed. The most up-to-date block of software is looking to launch in a few months, while the current batch of deployable aircraft use the previous block.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Runs slower </p>
</blockquote>

<p>its <em>top speed</em> is less than that of an f-16.</p>

<p>but that&#39;s irrelevant because f-16s don&#39;t fly at their top speed with weapons. </p>

<p>The f-35 on the other hand, can.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and turns slower than the old f-16 planes</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Its agility at speeds where dogfights happen is better than that of f16s.</p>

<p>But that&#39;s not really its role, so it&#39;s sort of irrelevant.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Cannot fly in rain or harsh sunlight</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wrong.</p>

<p>Absolutely and completely wrong.</p>

<p>Just do the tiniest bit of research.</p>

<p>F-35s were prohibited to fly in dangerous weather during testing phases, and this changed as the testing portions were complete. They were never &quot;incapable&quot; of flying during these periods. The restriction on testing during thunderstorms was lifted in 2015. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Heavier</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Irrelevant.</p>

<p>It also has greater thrust:weight ratio <em>with</em> larger fuel capacity. Also a higher flight ceiling.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>can be easily outmaneuvered by F-16 planes</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Incorrect.</p>

<p>In all regards it&#39;s roughly on par with f-16, and better at some important areas.</p>

<p>But high-energy dogfighting is a thing of the past, and not the F35s role. That&#39;s a lie repeated by fanboys and armchair morons who play too many videogames.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Flies blind and relies on satellite to guide itself</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t even know what this means or what the criticism is</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Has &quot;stealth&quot; which is easily counterable by chinese and russian radars</p>
</blockquote>

<p>According to?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Leaks oil and bursts in flame</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Uh.</p>

<p>No.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Has a helmet that allows it to see 360 degrees, but it&#39;s so heavy that the pilot cannot see the rearside properly</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not an issue.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Underpowered</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Actually it&#39;s not.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Has jamming systems that makes it easily noticable</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wut</p>

<p>Just wut</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And we will be using it as our only aerial superpower in world war iii since Lockheed Martin has decided to use it to replace 90% of us aircraft!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nah.</p>
