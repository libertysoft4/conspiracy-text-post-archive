        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This is just a random thought- but what if the legalization of marijuana is to make the public more passive when big things happen?</p>

<p>Noone as far as I know of has died from it, but it was illegal and demonized legally for a long time by the government. 
The side effects include- lack of motivation, bad memory, tiredness, and hunger - leading to binge eating - alcohol also makes people more passive, but drunks get in fights and argue, while stoners just fall asleep.</p>

<p>Despite being illegal, in mainstream media it was always there- movies like Cheech &amp; Chong, Half Baked showed the dopy lovable stoners, and rappers like Cypress Hill and Snoop Dogg made it seem bad ass.</p>

<p>Still, being illegal the channels to getting it were the same as any other drug, making it taboo still. although a lot still use it, for the more straight laced members of the community it was &#39;tried once at a party&#39; if at all since they had no way of sourcing it, or if they did it was mostly a &#39;treat&#39; and done discreetly.
And there are other similar substances but none with the hype that been built, enough that a political party can use the substance as their platform.</p>

<p>Now, on the brink of a market and dollar collapse, and World War 3, and if you believe the conspiracy- a New World Order to arise from the wreckage - Canada and most of the US are legalizing a substance that will make the public more docile... rebellious enough to be interesting to the public like alcohol, but with few health concerns and soon to be socially acceptable. The public becomes more passive, without much effort.</p>

<p>Yes there are some medical uses, but this was not known when marijuana was banned, and saying it does now makes it more attractive to more of the voting population. Medical uses for marijuana in the human body were not generally known when it was banned. And not marijuana yet but note how many drugs are overprescribed, even Tylenol3 has codeine- an opiate.
What if it was part of the NWO agenda all along?</p>

<p>As a second what if- Along with this, a few parties including Facebook and Elon Musk are bringing out technology to integrate our minds with the internet, so the effect will be that instead of memorizing things, it will just go without saying to &quot;just google it&quot; as we do already, but now mostly if we cant remember something or are looking up something new- making the internet part of our minds basically is scary in that the internet can be censored and moulded to the desired agenda by those in charge. </p>

<p>I would argue that in spite of more readily available information, the public is getting dumber in general - notice the 2 main candidates in the last us election, both ridiculous. And now protesters blatantly protesting Against freedom of speech and for censorship (opposite of the 60s)... begging to be more controlled and regulated.... and people are mad at Julian Assange, Edward Snowden and Wikileaks, who only show actual info they have, not opinions, wikileaks shows raw real data- the emails about Hillary were real. Yet the whistleblowers are successfully demonized to the public eye.</p>

<p>Think about it, who would benefit from this most?
You have a docile public who wants to be censored and controlled, not have to think for themselves, and unable to defend themselves against tyranny. The NWO end up being the good guys in the public eye, people begged them for it, like the patriot act- it won&#39;t be force-fed to the public, the public will vote for it...</p>

<p>These are just random thoughts, I may be way off and some of the above are extreme examples to make a point- for example, I&#39;m not saying all stoners are lazy, the same as not all alcoholics are violent, just either ends of the spectrum. If you you go to a night club, say there are 200 people and you might see 20 or so who are very drunk and maybe a fight- think of that in percentages and think how big the population is, now apply that rationale to the other substance and it&#39;s effects.
I&#39;m not arguing against legalization or anything like that, this is a comment in possible motives behind it and the hype.</p>

<p>Just think about it...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I honestly don&#39;t know one smoker that is an apathetic, do-nothing, think-nothing sort. the effects seem to be the opposite of stifling creative and critical thinking - if anything it enhances a broader view of reality and i think that is one reason the establishment has historically been against it. Of course if the genetics of the plant were tweaked so that the effects manifested differently - the establishment just might find a use for it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not everyone that smokes weed is lazy, but you must know some that are, even if they aren&#39;t your friends. Not everyone who drinks is an alcoholic or binge drinker. Think of it in percentages, and the substance becoming easily accessible with all of the major things going on- why now, and why all the decades of hype for this particular substance?</p>

<p>Kava has been used for a long time as well somewhat similarly, but there is not the hype, so few have or will try it.</p>

<p>Aside from all of the money keeping weed illegal generates, the establishment also hates it because it stimulates your pineal glad. Optimism, awareness, and humanism might develop. Or even worse: we&#39;ll all feel the weight of the yoke at the same time and shrug it off. </p>

<p>Weed doesn&#39;t make you docile and controllable, I mean I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve ever smoked, kind of looks like no, but it really seems you&#39;ve got no clue about Marijuana, let alone Medical marijuana </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Marijuana has 2 basic species- Indica and Sativa. The primary compunds are thc and cbd, thc being the psychoactive one.<br/>
Indica is more lazy/sleepy/hungry &quot;couchlock&quot;, Sativa is more cerebral. Both contain both thc and cbd though in different percentages, this will also vary by strain. Extracts are also available of pure thc or cbd.</p>

<p>My point is that it is another distraction from what is going on, and why the years hype and then turn over when big things are happening?</p>

<p>It does have a dulling effect, even as I said in above posts, if only a small percentage get this effect regularly, given how large the population is, it makes a difference.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t agree with your theory, but mainly because weed tends to broaden your mind and way of thinking, and opens discussions instead of stifling them. I do believe an agenda may still be at play, however. My theory is that once a majority of states have legal recreational marijuana and the majority of smokers get used to buying it from legal shops, they will alter how the marijuana is grown to make it poisonous - just like our food and water supplies. Eventually, the weed that is legal and we&#39;re allowed to smoke won&#39;t be much like weed at all. These recreational shops will replace medicinal ones (medical shops are already closing it seems), and eventually big pharma will profit off of a synthetic form of medicinal marijuana in pill form.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You need a wider circle of stoner friends. lol  Seriously, those side effects you mention are incorrect stereotypes.  I&#39;m a daily user and I am more clear headed and function at a higher level than I do without.  Those stereotypes are based predominantly on teen to mid 20s use, a period of life many are considered lazy with or without weed.  It&#39;s also corrected many medical issues I was experiencing in middle age, for the record.</p>

<p>That said, I agree they are legalizing for a reason. I think softening the blow of what&#39;s coming may be one but more than that, I believe they understand they&#39;ve lost the war on marijuana. How best to regain control than making the people believe they&#39;re giving in to their demands for easy access while creating laws that limit growing and selling of cannabis that will have the shit taxed out of it?  When all is said and done, they&#39;ve got control of who grows it and who sells it.  The college kid who grows a plant and shares with his buddies on the weekends are going to become the new villains because, again, you can&#39;t control what you don&#39;t own.</p>

<p>I may be happy they&#39;re at least not trying to keep up the lies about marijuana anymore but I&#39;m by no means stupid enough to believe they&#39;ve finally had an epiphany, of sorts.  That&#39;s just not how this country works.</p>

<p>Making it bad &quot;rebellious&quot; and building hype and then making it &quot;good&quot; and easily available when everyone knows about it at a time you want people to be more passive could be useful...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely. Agree with everything you say there.  I was a Just Say No graduate of the 80s, at the height of Reagan&#39;s war on drugs. I didn&#39;t start using mj until my 40s but I realized quickly the propaganda was just that. For me, it made me ponder what else they lied about but many others decided to test their tales with harder drugs. Too many of those cases didn&#39;t end well.</p>

<p>Now the tides are turning but not because, as you say, they wanted to but had/need to do so.  I&#39;ve got bets no more states will legalize because we&#39;ll see the end of the federal ban before the end of this year.</p>

<p>a lot of these college protest types smoke weed and think they&#39;re &#39;woke&#39; but the vast majority aren&#39;t people of action, of leadership, and of true thought. </p>
