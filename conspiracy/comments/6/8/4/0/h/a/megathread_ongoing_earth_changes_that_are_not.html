<p>&quot;Blessed are the meek:
for they shall inherit the earth..&quot;</p>

<p>Matthew 5:5.</p>

<p>It&#39;s 04/28. I&#39;m having another run at it against the downvote armada.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve also posted in - <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ConspiracyII/">https://www.reddit.com/r/ConspiracyII/</a></p>

<p>I believe if you want to it the &quot;old way,&quot; then go there.</p>

<p>I was proud to see all of the independent research that went on preceding to 04/26, if it did nothing more than mobilize industrious minds towards a common goal then so be it. I thought about it if we had the same sort of pre-coverage of the 9/11 operations that happened on the day maybe a light could have been shined on the whole thing. Do not be discouraged by the evident suppression of critical thought that is penetrating this sub.</p>

<p>Have you looked up at the sky lately? A global search is on - </p>

<p>I will go out on a limb and state I personally believe the sunrise/sunsets i&#39;ve witnessed with my own eyes are irregular with a more intense red glow than usual. I don&#39;t know what this means, I just know that it is different than I am used to. I have always remained perceptive of what&#39;s going on in the sky and I just can&#39;t shake the feeling.</p>

<p>What will happen on September 23, 2017?</p>

<p>What is going on with Syria? I think we are all being distracted. The response letter from Vladimir Putin -</p>

<p>(<a href="http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/54241">http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/54241</a>)</p>

<p>Still sticks to its guns with references to international law and UN related rhetoric.

<p>Is it a psy-op? Are we experiencing yet another well planned distraction.. (as insane as that sounds, and as insane as N.Korea really seems)</p>

<p>The map of the UN is..interesting -</p>

<p>It is an equidistant azimuthal projection. Which is a highly accurate map and one that I believe an accurate geometrical map.  One of Mercators early maps supposedly copied from older geometric maps is beautiful and extremely accurate.. it makes the earth look hollow? - <a href="https://www.wdl.org/en/item/6766/view/1/1/">https://www.wdl.org/en/item/6766/view/1/1/</a>. It is a beautiful map.</p>

<p>You may notice Antarctica in that map, and the azimuth projection.</p>

<p>I value interviews with people who have &quot;lived it,&quot; and take heed to what, and how they say things. I believe Mr.Byrd is being sincere in his talk of &quot;land beyond the South Pole, larger than North America.&quot; This is one of the ultimate truths, what lies beyond the South Pole.</p>

<p>Was the United States of America the victim of a coup many moons again that installed a pseudo government in power via Washington? There are 2 United States, one formed in 1787, the collection of the several sovereign states of the union, and another separate and different one formed in 1871, which only controls the District of Columbia and it’s territories.</p>

<p>I will continue to post until I feel there is a change of &quot;pace,&quot; and everything slows down... but I don&#39;t feel like that&#39;s going to happen anytime soon. I don&#39;t feel that I am the only one who has suddenly become &quot;awake,&quot; at something not being quite right at the moment in the world, whether it being a local change I can see or a global change as detailed below.</p>

<p>Please check my older threads for information from end of November 2016 onward.. I have run out of characters because there is just so much shit going on.</p>

<p>Apologies if you have read most of this already.. but just check on the recent updates at the bottom to see that whatever is going on is a global phenomenon and not something to turn your nose up at... and it&#39;s not stopping.</p>

<p>First.. read this - <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170113094903/https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2016/10/13/executive-order-coordinating-efforts-prepare-nation-space-weather-events">https://web.archive.org/web/20170113094903/https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2016/10/13/executive-order-coordinating-efforts-prepare-nation-space-weather-events</a></p>

<p>Regardless what you think, this Order is worded very seriously and encompasses a huge amount of resources in only a short release. It was released rather quickly and;</p>

<p>&quot;But the order bypassed the North American Electric Reliability Corp. (NERC), the interstate grid security monitor, which has been developing solar storm protections for the grid since 2012.</p>

<p>&quot;It was a surprise to us,&quot; said Gerry Cauley, NERC president and CEO.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxaM7BWb4Lw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxaM7BWb4Lw</a></p>

<p>What is the Schumann Resonance? Why is it increasing?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.drjoedispenza.com/blog/consciousness/what-does-the-spike-in-the-schumann-resonance-mean/">http://www.drjoedispenza.com/blog/consciousness/what-does-the-spike-in-the-schumann-resonance-mean/</a></p>

<p>&quot;On January 31, 2017, for the first time in recorded history, the Schumann resonance reached frequencies of 36+ Hz. It was considered an anomaly when in 2014 this frequency rose from its usual 7.83 Hz to somewhere in the 15-25 Hz levels—so a jump from 7.83 Hz to 36+ Hz is a big deal. That’s more than a five-fold increase in resonant frequency levels. What does this mean to us as inhabitants of Mother Earth? According to neuroscience, frequency recordings of 36+ Hz in the human brain are more associated with a stressed nervous system than a relaxed and healthy one.&quot;</p>

<p>Information on the &quot;Earth Wobble,&quot;.. or pole shift etc. Whatever you want to call it.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.wizaurad.com/axis-drift.html">http://www.wizaurad.com/axis-drift.html</a></p>

<p>We are wobbling on our axis, which will obviously have consequences on the earth.. if you notice in that plot diagram that the latter half of 2016 looks much more.. extreme. The Earth Wobbling is natural my only correlation in this is that where the graph gets more extreme is where I feel the world has started to respond at a similar pace.</p>

<p>Why is this happening? I don&#39;t know. So many different things at once, so many theories and facts to digest and dispute.. so much fake information, shit sources!</p>

<p>The URL is unfortunate but the links are solid and the information can be checked.</p>

<p>For Earth Changes (weather,seismic,volcanic) I started posting around November.. because November is when I started to become &quot;awake,&quot; that there is something not quite right with our planet at the moment and it is behaving abnormally.</p>

<p>Why do I say this? Most articles state that scientists are &quot;perplexed,&quot; or &quot;puzzled,&quot; at things that are happening.</p>

<p>FYI - All information is from watchers.news, an invaluable resource which is unopinionated and deals in facts. They reference various local institutions.. obviously depending on what the earth change is.</p>

<p>(I have cut content from older posts, please see those for additional information)</p>

<p>OKAY...</p>

<p>STILL WITH ME?</p>

<p>Going to pre-face December with some quick facts about Earthquakes.. because most of you will be saying &quot;volcanoes and earthquakes happen all the time.&quot; and you&#39;d be RIGHT! they do..</p>

<p>but; There have been 257 earthquakes over magnitude 5 and many more very close to this number. Just to put this into perspective on average there is an estimated 3.6 earthquakes of a magnitude of 5-5.9 a day, in the last 9 days there have been an average of 24.8 nearly 7 times what is usual. It is estimated there is a 6-6.9 magnitude earthquake every 3 days, we have had 2.6 a day for the last 9 days. Lastly for the big earthquakes of magnitude 7-7.9 you usually get 1 every 25 days (estimate) there have been an average of 1 a day for the last 9 days. (Stats from End of Dec.)</p>

<p>This is also referencing a cosmic energy wave, which is also being attributed (mostly on youtube unfortunately.. but nothing [mainstream] is talking about this) a helium gas cloud which we have entered bringing in higher H3,H4 into our atmosphere.
does anybody know what a brown dwarf star is made of????? (HELIUM)</p>

<p>Yes it is.  Which makes me wonder why you post things like this as if they are major events &quot;April 18th - Geomagnetic storms reaching G1 level expected&quot; when we both know that a G1 is a very minor event.</p>

<p>For those reading please see <a href="http://www.swpc.noaa.gov/noaa-scales-explanation">http://www.swpc.noaa.gov/noaa-scales-explanation</a> and check the scales for yourself.</p>

<p>FYI a G1 storm happens, on average, once every 2.36 days or ~1700 times per 11 year solar cycle.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How can you say this? Its an excellent post detailing WHY he&#39;s been feeling the way he has. What I take away regardless of your bias (why do you have bias on critical thinking in the first place?) You live in a fucking bubble, you should never make snap judgements about a person&#39;s character, insulating by saying mentally ill? Fucking really? Do you just use that phrase that liberally without knowing what the fuck it entails? </p>

<p>This is the opposite of what you are claiming. He said in the beginning he has been feeling this way and instead of sitting back and being content with that realization he did his research to try and find the reason why he has been feeling this way. You think life is as simple as what YOU think? Do you understand you provided absolutely nothing besides sounding like an arrogant rediculously stupid egomaniac? You enjoy that? If you disagree then move the fuck along. Don&#39;t discredit a great post OP clearly put alot of effort in because you are miserable. WHY do you have to add negativity to a subject that has absolutely no need for it? If its cause you think your right then think it in your head and stop insulting your fellow man. Nothing new would ever come about if people were as closed minded as you. Trying to shut down a detailed observation of one person&#39;s account of an obviously odd time for all of us is just so stupid. And you are garbage for doing so. </p>

<p>Stop being edgy by trying to derail a subject with personal insults. Do us all a favor a just disconnect your internet and sit with your own thoughts cause clearly you have it all figured out. </p>

<p>God I do not get why so many people say things like this. Mentally ill? REALLY? You actually believe that? I enjoyed reading this and then I see your shitty ass comment and it made me go right back to just hating people like you. If you do this in real life everyone must hate the fuck of you. You and your club of people of try and trigger others cause you are so fucking numb to anything beyond being a dick need to create an island where you all can just argue over each other for no reason. I got one for you, ya sound like a narcissist and I think that is a real mental illness.</p>

<p>People like you are what&#39;s fucking wrong with society. You are nothing. This comment only enforces negativity. Be original and try to step outside whatever view you hold so deaar.</p>

<p>Sorry OP. Great post, I&#39;m just the end of my rope with online soapbox champions that do nothing but assume they know the person that is clearly a good person. They need to go. </p>

<p>Would seem we are just in the turning point again and would suggest the tilt will start to settle down again. Seems also the wavelength is about 20 years.</p>

<p>Here is the same data that in OPs post, but from 1975: <a href="http://i.imgur.com/O2idk8p.png">http://i.imgur.com/O2idk8p.png</a> See we have been much more off tilt earlier and the center of the rotation seems to switch places.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting post, I like things like this and am glad to see the sub going back to it.</p>

<p>That being said, have you considered the possibility that things seem so doom and gloom because you have access to information that simply hasn&#39;t been available in the past, and that it&#39;s easy to take a bunch of minor, unrelated events and correlate them when you&#39;re looking for that result to begin with? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The attention on Antarctica here lately piques my attention as well, as a very casual conspiracy fan. </p>

<p>And I do know the feeling you mean. I won&#39;t put a timeline on it but every since I was very young I&#39;ve had this feeling of waiting on something just around the corner, something global. It&#39;s only gotten stronger. </p>

<p>It&#39;s actually so strong that I&#39;ve pretty much abandoned the ideas of ambition and material wealth and have lived the last several years with the goal to simply be content and happy. I&#39;ve never been able to shake the thought that anything I build for myself is just going to be taken. </p>

<p>I say this as someone who rolls my eyes at a lot of conspiracy stuff and who considers it a guilty pleasure. Even some of your comments make me cringe a bit, no offense intended. But I can&#39;t say I don&#39;t feel the same something deep in my gut. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just a note about the Bible and the constellations. Applying Biblical meaning to the constellations is dangerous, because the books of the Bible gain all of their authenticity by supposedly having being written in a certain area. If you move them to a point after Ptolemy outlined the constellations in Almagest, you&#39;re moving the writing of the Bible away from the timeline that it has to be written in to maintain authority.</p>

It doesn&#39;t matter if it&#39;s been happening for a million years. This is now, we have an infastructure that is fragile and almost everything we do relies on electricity. Wake up!</p>

<p>No I think it is backed up by actual data and scientific thought.  Your posts, on the other hand, are random listings of everything you think will scare people.</p>

<p>From my other post to you which you are ignoring for some <em>Strange</em> reason.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You are out of tune with the Earth. Wake up brother before it&#39;s too late. Listen to the words you speak, I feel you&#39;ve been typing with your eyes closed. </p>

<p>Then show statistical evidence that things are going a specific way.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is r/conspiracy</p>

<p>Yes it is.  Which makes me wonder why you post things like this as if they are major events &quot;April 18th - Geomagnetic storms reaching G1 level expected&quot; when we both know that a G1 is a very minor event.</p>

<p>For those reading please see <a href="http://www.swpc.noaa.gov/noaa-scales-explanation">http://www.swpc.noaa.gov/noaa-scales-explanation</a> and check the scales for yourself.</p>
