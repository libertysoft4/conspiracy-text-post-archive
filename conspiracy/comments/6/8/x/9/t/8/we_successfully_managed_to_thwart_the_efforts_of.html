        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The shareblue/CTR minions have familiarized themselves with our culture, and have stumbled upon something that has proven to be a useful new tool in their arsenal.</p>

<p>As you all know, part of controlled opposition (or commonly known as &quot;shills&quot;), is branding a particular community with a negative stigma. They attempt to infiltrate, and portray the forum or group as Racist, sexist, extremist, ect. </p>

<p>If that community has critical, and thought provoking discussion happening, it becomes a target. Obviously, r/conspiracy has been a target, ESPECIALLY since the Pizzagate story broke out.</p>

<p>Now, they know that there is a &quot;subculture&quot; within the conspiracy community that has an obsession and an unhealthy fixation on the influence of the Jewish/Zionist faction within the NWO...</p>

<p>They are attempting to exploit that community, (which, in all fairness, can be pretty radical, condescending, and outlandish at times, hurting our image), and rally them to the forefront. </p>

<p>This is being done to:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Cause division within the community</p></li>
<li><p>Most importantly, give them dirt and ammo against us to label is as a &quot;<strong>hate group</strong>&quot;</p></li>
</ol>

<p>If we get a reputation as &quot;anti Semitic&quot; or &quot;anti Jewish&quot;, This will effectively tarnish our image and our appeal, and we won&#39;t be able to reach the masses. </p>

<p>This is the way I see things happening unfortunately. Please, try to use control on the language you use, and be aware that we are ALWAYS under the microscope. I will agree that our self image is incredibly important in this critical time, and it should be preserved at all costs.</p>

<p>Pointing the finger at one ethnic or religious group and saying,</p>

<p><em>&quot;they are 100% responsible for this! They are inherently bad! If we got rid of them, everything would be fixed!&quot;</em></p>

<p>Is clearly a ridiculous way of seeing things, and for the good of our cause, shouldn&#39;t be promoted on this forum. </p>

<p>Just my 2c...</p>

<p>Peace and love my brothers. </p>

<p>Also, <strong>SPEAK UP.</strong> We need to drown out bad shitty shill comments with good, legitimate comments from real users like you. If someone says something stupid and makes us look bad, tell them. Let them know.</p>

<p>Contrarily, if you agree with a users good submission, upvote them and tell them. Add them as a friend, check out their post history. Send them a PM or something and let them know you liked what they had to say. Let&#39;s build each other up and motivate/encourage one another. Not to sound all fruity, but they can&#39;t touch us if we unite. </p>

<p>Your creating a misconception that i&#39;m trying to censor what people say. Not true. I agree that the Israel lobby is a powerful force within the establishment. But this ridiculous Anti Jewish extremism that we&#39;re seeing, you can&#39;t honestly condone that can you? A moderator who legitimately cared about the image of this discussion forum would see this shit as a problem.</p>

<p>Bullshit. You guys shit on pizzagate posts and remove pizzagate stuff for ticky tack reasons like &quot;Photoshop&quot;...Or whatever. You&#39;ll make something up. (Not all of the mods, but there are a few of you who do this).</p>

<p>Conspiracy theorists are already having a super hard time being taken seriously. We don&#39;t need outlandish crap like this polluting the sub. It just makes us look terrible, and we should be trying to establish our culture/community as a legitimate social/political force in society. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If things get ugly and wonky here, crying Shareblue every time will not help. This place has gone through some pretty obvious phases, I think the stream of neo-nazi &quot;red pilling&quot; is just /pol users trying to recruit and get their narratives out into popular places. Jewish Conspiracy is like their religion, and they&#39;re obsessed with Reddit (hating it), and probably trying to get a foothold here simultaneously. </p>

<p>Trying to research almost any conspiracy topic online will lead you into this shit eventually, since &quot;the Jews are behind everything bad.&quot; It&#39;s obviously bullshit and makes any legit critique of the Israeli state near impossible, but that&#39;s kinda part of their game. Best to downvote, blast the post in a comment, and move on. This place is a mess either way. </p>
