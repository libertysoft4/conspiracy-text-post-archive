They don&#39;t even have to carefully execute their lies to further their agenda, they know the story they tell will be what&#39;s written in textbooks. They now see that even if hundreds of millions of people believe that their government cold bloodily murdered a beloved young, American father and President and purposefully executed 3000+ innocent American civilians and brought America down to its knees that nothing will be done about it. They can sleep at night because we can sleep at night knowing of this shadow government entity. Why would they have and morale respect for a group of people who sit back and watch this before their eyes. We have failed as Americans and as Patriots, we sat back and watched and now we will forever pay. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Whoa. Youre taking me way too literal. Im not getting deep down in a study or a factual report i put together. At all. Im stating people i know in my age group 35-45 .. and many who own homes and cars and have a net worth of 7 figures actually believe the 9/11 govt report. I merely spoke of my own personal experience. With friends/family.  Youre talking public schools/indoctrination etc. apples to oranges</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Isn&#39;t it more likely that &quot;believe the gov&#39;t report&quot; isn&#39;t exactly true, but rather, believe &quot;the common myth&quot; as told through culture?</p>

<p>Like, there&#39;s a reason why the &quot;truth&quot; camp often knows waaaaay more about the event because they&#39;ve actually spent an hour looking into it, whereas the vast, vast majority haven&#39;t even spent that long looking into it, because they&#39;ve never even HEARD the suggestion that it wasn&#39;t the regular &quot;Al qaeda sent hijackers in planes to take down the towers.&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s not necessarily that everyone who believes is a moron - it&#39;s that they&#39;ve never even once fathomed that the story they&#39;ve been told isn&#39;t the right one.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very true.</p>

<p>I experienced the most astonishing thing about a month ago. I was showing my friends a certain doc about 9/11, getting as many people to watch it as possible, and this one friend was doing everything he could to avoid watching it, all while telling me he couldn&#39;t wait to watch it. </p>

<p>One night, drunk at a party, I told him I would stop trying to push the doc/ theories on him/ people. He said, &quot;I think that&#39;s a really good idea. I really don&#39;t know if I could take it knowing that my government did that to our own people.&quot;</p>

<p>I was shocked. Everything kind of clicked for me there. I felt so insanely bad for people like them, openly admitting that it all may be true, but he wasn&#39;t about to spend a second considering it because of the implications that would follow. It&#39;s honestly tragic, in my opinion. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>All sorts of variations on the theme, of course, when it comes to the details; but it boils down to nineteen religious fanatics perpetrating all the events of that day by themselves. That the destruction of the buildings was caused by other means than the actions of these nineteen men is something they can&#39;t and won&#39;t tolerate, because takes away one of the most important myths in the atheist version of religion, that religion destroyed the World Trade Center and that&#39;s why they are morally (sic) compelled to be jerks about religion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wouldn&#39;t care, except that they&#39;re always boasting about how scientific they are. &quot;Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence!&quot; Yet when it comes to the claim that three skyscrapers crushed themselves into powder accordion-style without explosives, literally no physical evidence at all is required.</p>

<p>Not even that, it&#39;s worse. They aren&#39;t even aware of that situation, and simply expect the scientific establishment who loves them so much to do all their thinking for them.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t mean every atheist, of course, just that really annoying r/atheism type. I can&#39;t really forgive most of the rest, either, though, who do nothing about it.</p>

If you&#39;re asking online then the people who are likely to reply to that are the ones who agree with you. And I seriously doubt youve gone up top hundreds of people individually and asked them what they think of 9/11. Honestly if some random guy came up to me and did that I&#39;d say I&#39;d agree with whatever he says just to get him to leave me alone. </p>

<p>And I seriously doubt youve gone up top hundreds of people individually and asked them what they think of 9/11. Honestly if some random guy came up to me and did that I&#39;d say I&#39;d agree with whatever he says just to get him to leave me alone.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ve been researching 9/11 since about a year after it happened.  To be quite honest I have probably talked to over a thousand people about it.  People have grown very skeptical of our government in general.  Far too many lies have been told in the age of the internet to be forgotten.  I am even noticing Trump supporters beginning to see past the bullshit, and that&#39;s kind of a shock because I thought it would have taken at least another year or so.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would be a bit cautious about statistics like this. I&#39;m not sure how the survey actually posed the question but believing the truth may be hidden from us covers a wide range of scenarios- for example, believing in a controlled demolition/nanothermite charges on the twin towers would be listed in the same category as &#39;the intelligence agencies fucked up and intentionally covered up evidence of their incompetence&#39;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>IMO the whole truth of 9/11 isn&#39;t necessarily important. The thing I prefer to focus on is that even if you buy the main story the blame for it lies squarely on the CIA.</p>

<p>The backed these guys with logistics, recruitment, money, training and weapons. Those assets where then used directly against US citizens in devastating acts of terrorism, and also on battlefields across multiple continents. </p>

<p>That&#39;s not even really debatable, nor is it conspiracy. People tend to agree with it because that&#39;s the main story. The CIA is responsible for 9/11. </p>

<p>Then I point out that, even after 9/11 and an ongoing war in Afghanistan, US intelligence <em>continued</em> to fund the exact same people and their affiliated groups in North Africa and the ME. Even while the US was officially at war with those same groups. </p>

<p>And finally I place emphasis on the point that all of the above is <strong>the absolute best case scenario</strong>. The best case scenario is that the CIA is responsible for thousands of US civilian deaths and thousands more military deaths and they have displayed no intention to stop engaging in those activities nor any real remorse. </p>

<p>At which point; does demolishing a building or a false flag really seem so insane?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly that&#39;s a really good question. And one I ask myself quite regularly if you want me to be honest. </p>

<p>My best answer is that I&#39;ve done my best to spread awareness. It&#39;s not much, but it is something. If you looked at my Facebook profile from the perspective of someone who is blissfully unaware of all the insane fucked up shit that is happening, I would look like a nutjob. I&#39;ve posted videos about Pizzagate, I&#39;ve posted about 9/11, Vaccines, GMOs, Chemtrails, Aliens, Bilderburg, the Illluminati, Skull and Bones and the Bohemian Grove. I&#39;ve been called a tin foil nut on several occasions. Been mocked, laughed at, blocked and deleted. So at least I am trying. </p>

<p>Also I try to further educate myself on these matters every single day. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Guys, we should stop making up conspiracies about JFK dying. It was very clearly a robbery that went wrong. There was no ulterior motive in his tragic death. You should stop questioning the narrative. His family is very upset by the people that keep harassing them over his death. There is no evidence that JFK was involved in any political associations that could result in someone wanting him killed. It&#39;s preposterous to even consider that and doing so makes you a perverted child molester.</p>

<p>And speaking of child molesters, I&#39;m very saddened by all the accusations being lobbed against my dearly departed friend Jimmy Saville. He was a sweet gentle soul who would never hurt a fly, much less sexually abuse children. My other dearly departed friends Margaret Thatcher and Pope John Paul II can confirm that not only was Saville a saint, but that it is completely ludicrous to suspect that any child abuse occurred under the watchful eyes of Britannia and the Vatican. To say otherwise is slander and I will sue your fucking pants off if you continue to question my facts.</p>
