<p>That same year. Teddy Roosevelt wrote “Behind the ostensible government sits enthroned an invisible government, owing no allegiance and acknowledging no responsibility to the people. To destroy this invisible government, to dissolve the unholy alliance between corrupt business and corrupt politics is the first task of the statesmanship of the day.”</p>

<p>There are many more examples of US presidents making these types of statements. JFK&#39;s <em>The President and the Press</em> comes to mind. </p>

<p>Who are they talking about? International bankers? Organized crime networks that have infiltrated government? </p>

<p>Suddenly the old Bill Hicks bit about being elected president seems more like truth than humor:</p>

<p>Would it?</p>

<p>The (thoroughly Jewish) magazine <em>FORWARD</em> might disagree, Here&#39;s their headine:</p>

<p><a href="http://forward.com/culture/325447/the-man-behind-the-fed/"><strong>The Jewish Story Behind the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank</strong></a></p>

<p>By Roger Lowenstein November 29, 2015</p>

<p>The <em>FORWARD</em> does NOT dodge the Jewish issue at all.</p>

<p>Far from being &quot;embarrassed&quot; by the Jewish Origins (and dominance) of the Federal Reserve, they display it as a Crown Jewel in Jewish achievement.</p>

<p>Hell, they even go so far as to imply that &quot;The Fed&quot; has had a POSITIVE effect on the USA.</p>

<p>Why so many Jews behave as if it is a &quot;dirty secret&quot; is a puzzler, to be sure.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I think Kushner went to see Bibi to ask for help in the Russia investigation. Kushner is just like Trump. They both live beyond their means by borrowing more money than they can pay back. Kushner borrowed billions of easy dollars from Russian banks, and he is hoping Bibi will pull a few strings and get him off the hook when the truth comes out.</p>

<p>Bibi may have agreed to &quot;take care of it&quot; for Kushner, and in turn the Trump administration will let Israel build all the settlements they want to. &quot;The Art of the Deal&quot;.</p>

<p>The theory that I think holds the most water, after all these rabbit holes is the theory of the Tri-Sovereign States (City of London, District of Columbia, The Vatican). </p>

<p>DC is the military wing of it, hence why our military dominates. City of London is the Banking, and the Vatican is the Religious. All are Roman Corporations, controlled by ancient bloodlines via the Black Nobility. Dating back to Egypt, Babylon, and Sumeria.</p>

<p>There is more to the theory, in the ancient age, but I rather not write a wall of text.</p>

<p>Ponder this as we go into the 4th of July, if you are a US citizen. Did we actually win our freedom from the Crown? The treaty of Paris may say otherwise....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here is a post I made with lots of info (text/video): <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/695cz9/the_two_bloodlines_of_cain_and_abel_the/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/695cz9/the_two_bloodlines_of_cain_and_abel_the/</a> as kind of an introduction into the theory. Also, I highly suggest watching the documentary: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZYB_IOqeOE">Ring of Power.</a>. It&#39;s a long documentary, but I highly recommend. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I imagine they&#39;re referring to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashkenazi_Jews">Ashkenazi</a>, who trace their Hebrew/Jewish ancestry through those who settled along the Rhine roughly one thousand years ago. Two-three hundred years ago, they moved steadily eastward, and settled in their current communities. As noted in the wikipedia article, Hebrew has not historically been their first preferred language (evidently this has caused friction with the Sephardi, or Spanish/Iberian Jewish community), as they speak <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yiddish">Yiddish</a>, a Judeo-Germanic hybrid language with some Slavic and Romance roots.</p>

<p>tl;dr Ashkenazi made up 92% of the total Jewish population til Great War part 2, they&#39;re not <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mizrahi_Jews">Mizrahi</a> (or Middle Eastern) but then again neither are the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sephardi_Jews">Sephardic</a> community. Who the fuck knows what <a href="/u/anonymoushero1">/u/anonymoushero1</a> is going on about, Theodor Herzl made things very confusing though so I don&#39;t blame them.</p>

<p>I have become convinced that the Judeo-Christian God is first and foremost the God(dess?(!)) of Doubt.</p>

<p>Richard&#39;s theory about who shot Kennedy is correct, but his information about the Nazis is fantastic. </p>

<p>Fun fact about American financing of the Nazi party: one of the banks in Manhattan that was shut down for Nazi financing under the Trading with the Enemies in Wartime Act was Union Banking Corporation. Its managing director at the time: Prescott Bush. George H. W.&#39;s father and George W&#39;s grandfather. </p>

<p>Prescott was not charged with any crime, of course. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The very word “secrecy” is repugnant in a free and open society; and we are as a people inherently and historically opposed to secret societies, to secret oaths and to secret proceedings. We decided long ago that the dangers of excessive and unwarranted concealment of pertinent facts far outweighed the dangers which are cited to justify it. Even today, there is little value in opposing the threat of a closed society by imitating its arbitrary restrictions. Even today, there is little value in insuring the survival of our nation if our traditions do not survive with it. And there is very grave danger that an announced need for increased security will be seized upon by those anxious to expand its meaning to the very limits of official censorship and concealment. That I do not intend to permit to the extent that it is in my control. … For we are opposed around the world by a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy that relies primarily on covert means for expanding its sphere of influence–on infiltration instead of invasion, on subversion instead of elections, on intimidation instead of free choice, on guerrillas by night instead of armies by day. It is a system which has conscripted vast human and material resources into the building of a tightly knit, highly efficient machine that combines military, diplomatic, intelligence, economic, scientific and political operations. Its preparations are concealed, not published. Its mistakes are buried, not headlined. Its dissenters are silenced, not praised. No expenditure is questioned, no rumor is printed, no secret is revealed.&quot; - JFK</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, it&#39;s obvious he&#39;s not. You know how he&#39;s not talking about the USSR? </p>

<ul>
<li>Because calling communism a monolithic conspiracy makes absolutely no sense.</li>
<li>Because he said around the world, meaning every place on earth. </li>
<li>Because saying the USSR (or any country for that matter) is using covert means to expand its influence is literally like saying water is wet. Unless you consider JFK an idiot when it comes to speeches I&#39;d say there&#39;s more to what he&#39;s saying.</li>
<li>Because no one in their right mind would ever refer to the Red Army as &quot;guerrillas by night&quot; rather than &quot;armies by day&quot;</li>
<li>It should be obvious that he&#39;s <strong>not</strong> talking about a country or a political theory (Communism) by the wording he is using. He&#39;s talking about something that controls countries like the USSR.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>“Whoever controls the volume of money in our country is absolute master of all industry and commerce...and when you realize that the entire system is very easily controlled, one way or another, by a few powerful men at the top, you will not have to be told how periods of inflation and depression originate.” ~ James A. Garfield</p>

<p>&quot;From the days of Sparticus, Wieskhopf, Karl Marx, Trotsky, Rosa Luxemberg, and Emma Goldman, this world conspiracy has been steadily growing. This conspiracy played a definite recognizable role in the tragedy of the French revolution. It has been the mainspring of every subversive movement during the 19th century. And now at last this band of extraordinary personalities from the underworld of the great cities of Europe and America have gripped the Russian people by the hair of their head and have become the undisputed masters of that enormous empire.&quot; ~ Winston Churchill, stated to the London Press, in 1922</p>

<p>&quot;For a long time I felt that FDR had developed many thoughts and ideas that were his own to benefit this country, the United States. But, he didn&#39;t. Most of his thoughts, his political ammunition, as it were, were carefully manufactured for him in advanced by the Council on Foreign Relations -- One World Money group. Brilliantly, with great gusto, like a fine piece of artillery, he exploded that prepared &quot;ammunition&quot; in the middle of an unsuspecting target, the American people, and thus paid off and returned his internationalist political support.</p>

<p>The UN is but a long--range, international banking apparatus clearly set up for financial and economic profit by a small group of powerful One--World revolutionaries, hungry for profit and power.</p>

<p>The depression was the calculated &#39;shearing&#39; of the public by the World Money powers, triggered by the planned sudden shortage of supply of call money in the New York money market....The One World Government leaders and their ever close bankers have now acquired full control of the money and credit machinery of the U.S. via the creation of the privately owned Federal Reserve Bank.&quot; ~ Curtis Dall, FDR&#39;s son-in-law as quoted in his book, My Exploited Father-in-Law</p>

<p>&quot;The powers of financial capitalism had another far reaching aim, nothing less than to create a world system of financial control in private hands able to dominate the political system of each country and the economy of the world as a whole. This system was to be controlled in a feudalist fashion by the central banks of the world acting in concert, by secret agreements, arrived at in frequent private meetings and conferences. The apex of the system was the Bank for International Settlements in Basle, Switzerland, a private bank owned and controlled by the worlds&#39; central banks which were themselves private corporations. The growth of financial capitalism made possible a centralization of world economic control and use of this power for the direct benefit of financiers and the indirect injury of all other economic groups.&quot; ~ Carroll Quigley</p>

<p>So yes, in this speech it&#39;s pretty clear that he&#39;s talking about the Soviets. He&#39;s harping about guerrillas and covert operations and secrecy because that&#39;s what the Cold War is all about. Remember that the domino theory is still valid at this time and the red menace is looming at every corner of the world. You don&#39;t know who&#39;s a commie and who isn&#39;t, it&#39;s basically a worldwide conspiracy, even your neighbour can be a Communist.</p>

<p>Your other quotes form a different picture but this speech doesn&#39;t.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First we should talk about about the fact that the people who control the money supply siphon unimaginable amounts of wealth back into their own hands while &quot;producing&quot; literally nothing. Especially these days when they can just press a few key strokes to create loans from nothing -lazy bums probably don&#39;t even write actual paper ledgers any more.</p>

<p>After that fact is addressed we can talk about whether or not taxation is theft. The way it works now though, it literally is because a big chunk of your taxes goes to paying down the interest on govt debt that was loaned to them out of thin air - and socialists seem to think cutting off their own leg is worth it if it means some rich guy has to cut off a fingertip.</p>

<p>And, again, none of that is an endorsement of the mainstream so-called &quot;free market&quot; Right wing: pro-bankster, pro-corporate welfare, pro-mil ind complex, etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why make a conspiracy out of that? Yes there are obvious problems with the political and economic system in the USA and pretty much everywhere else.
But instead of acknowledging that simple truth and looking for practical ways to change it and work to make things better you draw up this vast global conspiracy that is too deep rooted and powerful to ever do anything else but complain about it on the internet and patting each other on the back for it.</p>

<p>If you think truly you have found something that is truly wrong with the world the next step should be to look at how you can take steps to make things better. And that involves breaking things down and looking for a place to start. If you treat this huge injustice you see as some kind of ambiguous far away concept that is like wanting to become a singer and then instead of starting to practice just talking about how difficult it would be to manage your career as a world star using that as an excuse to not practice at all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Did this make it to r/all? Do you not understand that a group understanding of the scope of a problem is required ?  How else would one delegate responsibility in an efficiently suitable way to satisfy the requirements of said problem if the scope wasn&#39;t well defined via interaction?  Perhaps the non existent problem will graciously hand out flyers informing everyone of all the evil shit they have done and are continuing to do.  Then we won&#39;t have to talk.  Then maybe people would know what the fuck they are supposed to do.  Get this, that is unity.  Lean not on your own understanding.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A group understanding of a problem would be a great start to tackling a lot of problems but that is certainly not what people in this sub are doing. You cannot seriously think that a sub like this is actually raising awareness for real tangible problems. All you are doing is perpetuating a world view that makes it easy to ignore those real tangible problems and instead create these bizarre caricatures of them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are posting on a thread that says our leaders are scared of some unknown problem.   At least comment regarding the subject.  Everyone here knows that their part in a functioning society is smaller and less exciting than bringing down the bad guys, but I see no reason why we can&#39;t have conversations in our down-time where we discuss bigger supposed issues. Maybe someone who can make a bigger impact at the higher levels might stumble upon some information that makes their job easier.  You never know!</p>

<p>The real conspiracy is that there are no conspiracies - other than what people make up off the top of their heads. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>IMO it&#39;s mostly because those trappings automatically gaslight any conversation about the ruling elite. To a normal person it doesn&#39;t matter if you&#39;re 100% factually correct, you sound insane when you start talking about satanic rituals, pedophiles etc and they tune you out. </p>

<p>I think those things are also great distractions. They&#39;re the classic moral panics, they evoke far more of an emotional response than a logical one, and they dominate discussion. Throw a pedophile in your organization, John Podesta for example, and then throw him under the bus when you face scrutiny for something less titillating than kid fucking. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Satanic rituals could easily still be possible. You have to understand that a small group of people with psychopathic tendencies could easily still have some occult systems as a form of practice.  Even if you feel that the metaphysical aspect of these practices isn&#39;t real, the only thing that matters is that they believe it&#39;s real (even though my personal opinion is that the metaphysical aspect to these rituals holds a lot of truth to it and is closer to reality than people might think) .</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It think it is sad that so many people in this sub seem to be living in this thought prison because of their worldview. You are using these conspiracies as an excuse to not have to seriously confront yourself with real actually solvable problems. But solving real problems that exists in our world takes more effort than creating theories about how all of those problems are caused by things so far out of your control you might as well do nothing.</p>

<p>If you have this realisation that things in your life and by extension in society or the world in general are going wrong then the next step is to analyse it from the top down until you reach a level where you as an individual can start making a change. What most of the theories are doing is only creating more steps between you as an individual and the change you want to make in the world. They make it easier to justify not changing your own behaviour.</p>

<p>Imagine there is an election that is decided by one vote but you didn&#39;t vote for your party but you didn&#39;t vote because you had this theory that the vote is rigged by the opposing party anyways. </p>

<p>Or imagine you are looking for a job and you don&#39;t get any interviews but instead of changing your resume or looking for ways to make your applications stand out you tell yourself that they are somehow discriminating against you based on this theory you have.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Or how about open discussions on boards that people frequent in their own time is not an indicator of anything other than an open discussion. Speaking about the problems of this world starts at examining the entire problem.  Until you know the whole picture you should ask questions, seek clarity, and shut the fuck up.</p>

<p>Seriously, projecting your emotional response to an opinion piece onto others is something you should do to your mother.  Yes, change starts locally, but a collective understanding of the problem is required! So please, spare us, and let a conversation take place.  And go get a real job.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Woodrow Wilson said this is 1913--the same year he signed the Federal Reserve Act into law, enslaving us all.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wilson&#39;s speeches were collected in 1913, but he was saying this in 1910 to 1912. If you read the quote <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=MW8SAAAAIAAJ&amp;amp;pg=PA13&amp;amp;dq=%22Since+I+entered%22">in context</a>, he&#39;s talking about monopolies and other entrenched businesses preventing new competitors from entering markets.</p>

<p>By the way, you should find out how the Federal Reserve actually works. Saying that it is &quot;enslaving us all&quot; is ridiculous propaganda.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That same year. Teddy Roosevelt wrote “Behind the ostensible government sits enthroned an invisible government, owing no allegiance and acknowledging no responsibility to the people. To destroy this invisible government, to dissolve the unholy alliance between corrupt business and corrupt politics is the first task of the statesmanship of the day.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is from the <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=pwaIAAAAMAAJ&amp;amp;pg=PA304&amp;amp;dq=%22Behind+the+ostensible+government%22">1912 Progressive Party platform. </a>. It&#39;s talking about &quot;the unholy alliance between corrupt business and corrupt politics,&quot; that is, big business buying influence.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are many more examples of US presidents making these types of statements. JFK&#39;s <em>The President and the Press</em> comes to mind.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>JFK was talking about the international communist menace. He was saying to the press, <em>we hate secrets but sometimes they&#39;re necessary. Don&#39;t forget who the real enemy is. They don&#39;t play by any rules and don&#39;t have to answer to anybody.</em> JFK asked the newspapers to censor themselves on national security questions since we were not in a declared war.</p>

Meaning, if someone really knew the finite details about <em>insert any major conspiracy of the 20th-21st century</em> that person would be ostracized beyond belief, until that person retracted their statements. So if this person speaks up, what makes TBTB not create a strategy to immediately discredit him/her. Blackmailing in essence to me is the key why plain as day &quot;conspiracies&quot; have actual traction to some but never gain mainstream traction over the fear of being either blackmailed or have your name slandered and drug through the mud.

    <div class="md"><p>This is what&#39;s so hard for me to understand, and the only remaining place for me that feels inclined to critique people&#39;s worldview as being &quot;conspiratorial.&quot;</p>

<p>I can only understand the world in terms of empiricism and incentive.  I can understand &quot;pizzagate&quot; type situations because the incentive is clear.  You want power, you set up a system of blackmail.  I can even understand things like George Soros because he&#39;s a Jew and evolution acting on a parasite tribe for long enough and you have a people able to act in their group interest at all times seemingly in concert without ever having spoken about it in most cases.</p>

<p>But this Illuminati, Rothchild sicko shit with the satanism and the Moloch and the Eyes Wide Shut Parties.  It just does not compute.    Without adopting some metaphysical worldview based on demons and evil instead of nature and incentive it just makes no sense for me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay. I do want to discuss this with you guys, but right now I have a throbbing headache. Here is what I posted 7 days ago,and I think I was &quot;on the money&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I think Kushner went to see Bibi to ask for help in the Russia investigation. Kushner is just like Trump. They both live beyond their means by borrowing more money than they can pay back. Kushner borrowed billions of easy dollars from Russian banks, and he is hoping Bibi will pull a few strings and get him off the hook when the truth comes out.</p>

<p>Bibi may have agreed to &quot;take care of it&quot; for Kushner, and in turn the Trump administration will let Israel build all the settlements they want to. &quot;The Art of the Deal&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But he explicitly talks about &quot;military, diplomatic, intelligence, economic, scientific and political operation&quot; those are operations that only a state can perform.</p>

<p>Also, he says that &quot;it&quot; conducts the cold war: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Its preparations are concealed, not published. Its mistakes are buried, not headlined. Its dissenters are silenced, not praised. No expenditure is questioned, no rumor is printed, no secret is revealed. It conducts the Cold War, in short, with a war-time discipline no democracy would ever hope or wish to match.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So yes, in this speech it&#39;s pretty clear that he&#39;s talking about the Soviets. He&#39;s harping about guerrillas and covert operations and secrecy because that&#39;s what the Cold War is all about. Remember that the domino theory is still valid at this time and the red menace is looming at every corner of the world. You don&#39;t know who&#39;s a commie and who isn&#39;t, it&#39;s basically a worldwide conspiracy, even your neighbour can be a Communist.</p>

<p>Your other quotes form a different picture but this speech doesn&#39;t.</p>
