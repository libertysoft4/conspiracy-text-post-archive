        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>TLDR: An unmarked Blackhawk helicopter flew over me three times in three different towns during a span of 8 days. </p>

<p>I am both cringing and laughing at the irony of writing a post about black helicopters. For those who don&#39;t know, the term &quot;black helicopter conspiracy theorist&quot; is synonymous with calling someone a &quot;tinfoil hatter&quot; in order to discredit them and label them crazy. </p>

<p>But all jokes aside, a black unmarked helicopter has flown over me on three separate occasions this past week, all in different locations. It/they were all flying fairly low so I&#39;ve been able to get a good look, and they looked like Blackhawks or one of its many variations. I live in Connecticut, over an hour away from Sikorsky (manufacturer of Blackhawks), but in 26 years of living in CT–including multiple years spent in a city much closer to that area–I have never seen or experienced anything like this before.  </p>

<p>The first was last Tuesday (June 20) while I was loading groceries into my car in the parking lot of my town&#39;s Stop and Shop; it was around 8:30 or 8:40 PM. It was right around sunset and still pretty light out. As it flew over my boyfriend and I, a spotlight turned on then turned it off after it passed us. Naturally I immediately thought it was strange to see what was clearly a military helicopter flying low over a grocery store parking lot of all places, but I didn&#39;t dwell on it.</p>

<p>Then on Monday (June 26) my friend and I were at my parent&#39;s lake house (about 20 min away from first sighting), and we were laying on the dock when it flew toward us over the lake and passed over, again with the spot light even though it was at 1:45 in the afternoon. </p>

<p>The most recent I was alone. It was yesterday evening (Wednesday June 28) around 7:30 PM. I had just dropped my boyfriend off at work (45 min from first sighting, 60+ from the second) and was driving home. My music was pretty loud and I didn&#39;t hear it coming, so I jumped a little when I looked up and saw it directly above my line of sight through the winshield, just barely over the tree line and situated perfectly horizontally between each side of the road which was was just thick forest all around.</p>

<p>Maybe it&#39;s just a coincidence, but I am a little creeped out that I just happened to be in three separate towns on three different occasions and in a position to see them all pass directly over me. Especially especially because I live in the middle of nowhere and a sighting like that was extremely out of place and uncharacteristic for the area I live in. Sikorsky delivers tons of aircraft throughout the world and I have never seen one (at least not one that was unmarked and noticeably out of place) let alone three times in a week. The whole thing just feels bizarre to me as I&#39;m writing it out. </p>

<p>For the past year I have been doing extensive investigating/research for an article I&#39;m going to write, and it is government/military related, but I haven&#39;t even started writing it yet, and it seems ridiculously far fetched and paranoid to think that it&#39;s somehow related.</p>

<p>It is especially creepy because last year I had a nightmare that I walked outside of my house to find the sky filled with military bombers and helicopters shooting and bombing everything.</p>

<p>Has anyone else seen anything like this going on where they live, or experienced a similar situation? I don&#39;t consider myself to be paranoid, just highly vigilant and observant of my surroundings and when things aren&#39;t the norm. I am also well aware of what our Gov&#39;t. is capable of and what it HAS done to its own people in the past, so if that makes me paranoid then so be it. I haven&#39;t found any mention of planned training exercises and as far as I know there has been no mention of it in the local news or newspaper.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I went to college in a relatively remote city about an hour out of Kansas City. About this time of year, federal agents and black helis would show up. They were, for the most part at least, looking for marijuana crops hidden in the middle of cornfields. Given Session&#39;s attitude towards marijuana, perhaps the program has stepped up and now includes your region in its operations. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a trip once you realize what&#39;s happening. It&#39;s been my experience they turn up the heat in correlation to what you&#39;re involved in, including just researching, and/or what you&#39;re discovering. </p>

<p>I&#39;m on the ground floor of a two-story condo building and they often get close enough to make everything inside vibrate and/or rattle. My personal fave is when they come in cloaked when I&#39;m outside and they just appear at full volume right overhead. A close second is when I get up to go look outside and it goes totally silent when I open the door. For extra credit, they&#39;ve shown up here and at a friend&#39;s house when we were on the phone discussing their nonsense. </p>

<p>You&#39;re not being paranoid. The intent is to distract and/or get you to stop what you&#39;re doing. Next time it happens, smile and wave at them and then continue on with what you&#39;re doing. You&#39;ll probably begin hearing clicks when you&#39;re talking on the phone next. If that happens, acknowledge it and keep talking. They&#39;re harmless dicks, so don&#39;t let them get to you. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just feel like that would be an extremely excessive (not to mention expensive) thing to do all just to trying and spook me, no? If this actually were the case then there are so many cheaper, easier, more effective, and more covert ways of spooking someone. I mean there&#39;s got to be another reason for them to be in the area - that is the most logical explaination. The part that gets me is that I just happened to be situated in a place to see them three times ...what is the probability that this would happen? Especially taking into consideration the type of helicopter and the fact that if you are going by the &quot;official&quot; accounts they are used very minimally within the US, and those that are always have markings and/or a registration number</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hold up your camera phone and start taking pictures/video as soon as you see them, for as long as they are in sight. If you can catch a tail number, very useful info.  If they see you doing it, more power to ya. It means that you are aware of their activity and they know you cannot be intimidated.</p>

<p>Have you tried looking up live data on the flight aware website?  Supposedly it tracks the live location of every aircraft in the air.  Probably not tracking all militarily sensitive aircraft (for instance, Air Force One).  It would be interesting to know if it is listed or even visible on there.  You should be able to just punch up the live map and look at your location and see all the aircraft around you, even without knowing their tail numbers. This would allow you to look it up and cross reference and find out who is the registered owner. I know this works for private fixed wing aircraft. Never tried it for helicopters or government owned.</p>

<p>FYI the CIA and DEA have a number of aircraft that fly around for surveillance and intel purposes.  They are usually Cessnas and other small fixed wing planes with special cameras and recording gear and probably radio receivers and Stingrays. They tend to fly in circles for hours.  They are usually registered to fake holding companies, such as ABC Research in Fairfax VA or something obvious like that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow...The day before I saw the helicopter for the first time (it was a Sunday) i pointed out to my boyfriend that there was a small plane that went back and forth twice over my house within a few hours, then twice over my parents house later that day when I was there... I couldn&#39;t tell if there was a camera but it was dark gray with lighter gray wings that were very long (for the size of the body) and straight. One also went over my house as I was typing my original post.... now I&#39;m def going to be keeping better track</p>

<p>I also tried to take pictures the second time I saw the helicopter but for some reason it was really hard to see it through the camera - on my screen it looked tiny even though it it obviously was enormous </p>

<p>And thank you for telling me about that website, I was trying to find something like that!!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK, I did a little tiny amount of research since I typed that.</p>

<p>There are two websites you should bookmark: flightradar24.com and flightaware.com.  They apparently are supposed to track all aircraft with certain types of transponders, but they do not get all the airplanes period. Only the ones with a newer type of transponder called ADS-B. They are not required until 2020, they are optional at this point. Most commercial aircraft have them but most private aircraft do not.  Also they have to be at an altitude sufficient for a tracking tower to see them line-of-sight in order to show up on the live map. If they are flying &quot;below the radar&quot; so to speak, they may show up intermittently or not at all.</p>

<p>If you look at the live maps, you will find an occasional helicopter thrown in there about 1% of the time. They are not common. I managed to find a NYPD police helicopter circling over Harlem just a few minutes ago, and I saw a few unidentified fixed wing aircraft with weird tail numbers that were probably military jets flying over the west coast, so we know at least some government aircraft show up there.</p>

<p>Once you find your helicopter that is over your house, if you click on it, it will show you what the tail number and type of aircraft (make/model) and it will show you its tracked flight path and where it originated. Usually updates once a minute.</p>

<p>Helicopters usually do not file flight plans? Didn&#39;t know this. That means you can&#39;t look up the history of the tail number and find out where it was flying a week ago. You can do that with most fixed wing if they are filing flight plans.  If anyone knows more, please chime in. I&#39;m new at this.</p>

They hardly ever list a flight plan for their helicopters. They have several helos (two were up while I was looking) but the last filed flight plan was in January. So either they are missing info on those websites or they don&#39;t do flight plans.  I don&#39;t know enough about aviation to make a claim one way or the other.</p>

<p>That is the aviation geek who can be rightfully credited with discovering the FBI&#39;s little secret domestic airforce of approx 114 spy Cessnas mounted with NSA DRTBOX and BADDECISION and probably NRO sensor too which circle 114 of the biggest US cities 24/7 Monday-Friday since at least 7 years ago.</p>

<p>FBI is bulk recording all WiFi and tracking all cell phones in all homes across entire cities.</p>

<p>It&#39;s related to the NSA program SKYNET and MASTERSHAKE and SECONDDATE and COTRAVELLER which were leaked by Snowden.</p>

<p>Basically flying planes to scoop up everyone&#39;s comms.</p>

<p>May you live in Interesting Times.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Excuse me it&#39;s not stupid to be vigilant. Many whistleblowers were not &quot;paranoid&quot; enough. We all know what happened to Seth rich. Or Julian assanges lawyer. The list is endless. Think two steps ahead and be difficult to read. FBI anon planted false leads for plausible deniability. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s just consider how many investigators durning the Franklin investigation died. The biggest mistake anyone can make is to keep their guard down and downplay the risks. I am no security expert. But if I were you I would be making it difficult for whoever is tracking me to not know where you stand. Your wifi network is probably been hacked, at minimum. 
It&#39;s better to be safe than sorry. I know when I was following pizzagate investigation, when it first was discovered. I was visited by an odd person who knocked on my door and asked me if I was afraid of public speaking. I was like what do you want? She said I am just talking to people because public speaking is scary don&#39;t you agree? I said sure gotta go! 
It was only afterwards that I realized I was maybe, key word maybe being warned. I am not even an investigator. I have terrible computer skills and never would have thought I was a target. So better be safe than sorry. Stay vigilant!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I live in a rural area, our county airport takes off over my house and I&#39;ve lived in that area for most of my life.</p>

<p>There have been more helicopters coming and going from that airport for the last year than there has in my entire time living there. I can&#39;t see them because of trees but I often hear what sounds like helicopter blades and jet turbines - from the same craft I imagine, the sounds seem to come from the same source.</p>

<p>Last month ISIS released a 42 minute movie showcasing their factory where they manufacture MANPADs. They boast that their MANPADs are better than the American&#39;s.</p>

<p>If you keep seeing Black Helos, perhaps it would be wise to acquire the ISIS movie for study to reverse engineer how to manufacture your own MANPAD.</p>

<p>A Blackhawk doesn&#39;t stand a chance versus a cloned SA7 MANPAD which can hit a ceiling range of 30,000ft.
Hell, you might even be able to down an MQ-9 Reaper on a cloudy day.</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t feel like you&#39;re being too paranoid. I&#39;ve seen the helicopters here in Chicago too, this week as well. I try not to put much thought into it as I have no illegal criminal activity going on. I pretty much just skim this forum and YouTube watching videos. Nothing that&#39;s a threat.</p>

<p>However,  I have had some weird technology issues. I&#39;ve had zero problems with my iphone but have suspected it&#39;s been tapped. I did a tap test by simply waiting until I got to a 2% battery Mark and saying the names of what I thought they were listening for. Sure enough my phone went dead but I was able to carry on my conversation for another 27 minutes. I&#39;ve tried this multiple times and it hasn&#39;t failed. About a month ago my iPhone&#39;s cellular service stopped working I could use the wifi but couldn&#39;t actually make or accept calls. The bill was paid I took it to my provider and they sent it to be repaired it came back that or couldn&#39;t be repaired. My friends in IT and ran some reset on his phone what he found was a third party software was running on my phone essentially recording and backing up my messages. </p>

<p>I feel as if I&#39;m under surveillance  mostly since I started hanging out with a group of people. I think they&#39;re just trying to figure out my role since they&#39;ve had an investigation pending. I&#39;m really just friends with them through association and have my knowledge of anything  that would be suspicious. I&#39;m not doing any criminal or illegal so I brush if all aside. super fucking creepy man.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK guys I really think something weird is going on in my town. I could be wrong of course but I wanted to post this somewhere now in case they are gearing up for an &quot;active shooter&quot; or &quot;terrorist&quot; drill that in the worst case scenario goes live... besides the helicopters and low flying small planes my town has become flooded with out of state cars the past few days and they all follow each other down the street. It is a big travel weekend obviously but 98% of them are American made typical &quot;fed&quot; vehicles: chevy and ford SUVS, pickup trucks, with New York and Massachusetts plates. Even the people look extremely out of place here. My town is definitely not a tourist destination and the fireworks aren&#39;t even until next weekend, so there are no events or concerts planned for this weekend. The street a block down from me is completely lined with these cars along with a huge black trailer and I have seen an unmarked white van type thing with cages over the only small windows on its back doors driving around the past few days. Like I said could be nothing but I just felt that I had to post it because I have a nagging feeling about it </p>
