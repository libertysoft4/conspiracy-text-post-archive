<p>My theory is that religion is used to control the masses regardless of which story is used as a basis for that belief. </p>

<p>Asking why I find anything wrong with a book someone wrote is irrelevant to the question you asked and only shows that you aren&#39;t really here for input from another. You just want to throw your religion in people&#39;s faces.</p>

Maybe OP could have elaborated more on their specific beliefs, and how they relate to a conspiracy. But, maybe we can engage OP further and ask them more thought-provoking questions. Not by calling them out on what we percieve them as.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A few days back this same OP came in here and I fully explained that I had only just started to explore the Bible, etc. and it was sad or odd to me that having explained myself that way, Bible verses were being <em>demanded</em> of me. Yeah - now how does that work? </p>

<p>So, I had indeed been looking into Jericho (long way around...I read the Books of Enoch and that is some heavy duty stuff and the conspiracy angle is, why are those <em>writings</em> not good enough for the Bible etc...) so here others were commenting that G_d is a genocidal maniac and OP did nothing to defend G_d or the Bible at all! </p>

<p>So here I am, very new or ignorant to the Bible and it leads me to believe this person isn&#39;t equipped or educated enough to defend, refute or discuss and is still demanding that myself or others just <em>blindly follow</em> or spit back Bible verses to satisfy OP that we can <em>hear</em>?</p>

<p>Now I imagine this person would shit bricks trying to stand up against a radicalized zealot (pick your religion!) and is promoting(?) or cheering to see Damascus fall even if it means hundreds of Christians, Muslims or just innocents die in the process - it boggles the mind.</p>

<p>If the words are <em>Of</em> G_d and <em>From</em> G_d then shouldn&#39;t a person proselytizing be able to stand and discuss and debate? Very confusing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The act of loving a Holy God is not a control mechanism, but rather the way the Bible gets people to believe and love the Holy God. &quot; If you don&#39;t repent, and turn to God, you will be condemned to a fiery Hell.&quot; </p>

<p>That&#39;s how it is a control mechanism. Fear of going to Hell.</p>

<p>People have the free will to choose if they want everlasting life, or eternal death, but that does not mean they will be condemned to hell for all eternity, if they choose death.  If a personality chooses death, they will be destroyed eternally, and will no longer be involved with the progression career of ascending mortals.</p>

<p>But being destroyed isn&#39;t from fear or control, if the personality chooses it.</p>

<p>Just like you not having answers about Jericho - as to why G_d is cast as a mass, genocidal murderer of babies, women etc. but you did not defend or even discuss why G_d ordered the <em>complete slaughter even down to the animals</em> - my guess is you do not know the answer or you&#39;re afraid to defend the Words of G_d?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The gospel has been edited, to keep people in fear.  </p>

<p>Why should we fear our father in heaven? He is a loving and merciful father, and has forgiven us, even before we have thought to ask for forgiveness.</p>

<p>Our Father does not want us to believe because of fear, but rather believe because we truly want and desire to be with him.  </p>

<p>I believe in Jesus and our Father in heaven, but I also think that the Bible has been edited to control through fear.</p>
