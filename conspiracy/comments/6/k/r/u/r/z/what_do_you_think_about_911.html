    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think anyone who watches WTC7 come down can honestly say they don&#39;t have some misgivings. They then cling to any official explanation in order not to confront the appalling truth.</p>

<p>On the day itself, I watched the thing unfold but didn&#39;t see the towers collapse. I was in another room and my wife came in to tell me that &quot;they are saying the towers are gonna collapse&quot; and I said &quot;no way. It&#39;s not possible...&quot; And then they did fall down. I said the bombers must have put explosives in the buildings. </p>

<p>I didn&#39;t think much about it until maybe 6 months later when I caught a BBC documentary made by the well-respected Horizon team. I watched this and they came out with the pancake theory of the collapse and I sort of accepted that. Hey it&#39;s the BBC! Practically the word of god here in the UK...</p>

<p>It wasn&#39;t until maybe 3 years later that I heard about WTC7 and that was a major wake-up call for me. The fact that even today some people don&#39;t know about tower 7 is a red flag in itself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In 6 years of war we took massive technological leaps. To the point that in 1945 we were using basic computers to allow electric guns on the B-29 to compensate for airspeed, lead, gravity, temperature and humidity, and even control multiple guns from a single control. We had fine tuned nuclear technology, radar, and beginning the spade work for more complicated computers. 24 years later following a massive post war boom and development, we more than had the technology to get man on the moon, and we did so several times afterwards until 1972. I think you underestimate the technology we had available to us, and grossly overestimate the technology required .</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, you&#39;re right about the temperature. Didn&#39;t know that. But here&#39;s some info:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are three ways heat can transfer and only two are possible on the Moon. The first is radiation, both directly from the Sun and from the Sun’s reflection on the surface. The astronauts’ spacesuits were designed to reflect almost 90% of the light that reaches it, so very little heat would have transferred to the astronauts.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The second is by conduction from the direct contact their feet had with the surface. This is also an ineffective process as regolith on the lunar surface doesn’t conduct heat well and the astronauts’ boots were insulated, slowing down conduction even further. This shows that even though huge temperature variations occur on the Moon, lunar astronauts were never actually exposed to them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>History tells us conspiracy theories are bollocks, from JFK, Moon landings, to 9/11, they rely on fabrications, half truths, anecdotal evidence and cherry picking, ignoring all evidence that contradicts them, to fool people into believing lies, buy their book/DVD&#39;s/donate money, and turn a profit from peoples ignorance. In regards to 9/11, every single conspiracy theory has been thoroughly debunked. All you have to do is google what ever the claim is and read the rebuttals. </p>

<p>Aside from that, apply common sense.. why would a government risk treason and death penalty so they can stage an attack, blame Arabs from every country except the one you want to invade, and risk exposure for the rest of your lives by any of the hundreds/thousands of people that would have had to be involved to pull it off? Common sense destroys all conspiracy theories.</p>

<p>1993 attacked the World Trade Center killing 6. 
1995 Bojinka plot, although disrupted, would have taken down 10 airliners going between Asia and the US and could have killed over 4000 people. It was planned by the same guy who masterminded 9/11 - Khalid Sheik Mohammed.
1996 attacked Khobar Towers killing 19, including US Servicemen.
1998 attacked both US embassies in Tanzania, and Kenya killing more than 200.
2000 attacked the USS Cole killing 17 US servicemen.
2001 9/11 attacks, killing 300,
2002 Bali bombing, 200 killed.
2004 Madrid train station bombing, 192 killed.

The message being that 911 was an inside job.  You&#39;ll either hit a wall of ignorance or a conterted effort tha5 it would be an impossible task to arrange for.</p>

<p>What you may see is controlled opposition under the cover/guise.of ignrance and or true believers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nothing, just explosions. The planes were added in CGI over many different takes. The volume of material edited to show planes makes it seem very convincing, but just like the &#39;credible non-CIA eyewitness&#39; who says &#39;oh yeah I saw it all, the building collapsed mostly due to structural failure because the fires were so intense&#39;, the handheld footage with edited planes was all filmed by CIA plants. All pilots asked agree that the flights supposedly performed by the airplanes are impossible. And the hijackers were absolutely terrible pilots. There were no planes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>more often than not i would agree with you, but regarding 9/11, why would they risk treason and death penalty? lol?</p>

<p>you can get them to write bush a parking ticket let alone trial him for this</p>

<p>once you&#39;re in a position to control who gets treason charges, you do not fear them your self</p>

<p>and i do too like the <em>incompetent over malice</em> saying but in this case, circumstantial evidence is so huge it would be quite a coincidence if none of that was connected. and by quite, i mean astronomical.</p>
