    <div class="md"><p>What war? The civil/second revolutionary war in America. It&#39;s gonna be for the weak and the ones who can&#39;t fend for themselves. I suggest you get supplies now and find a safe location to get to once shtf. Most likely your safe in Texas or a southern states. If civil war/revolutionary war breaks out they have a better chance of making their own country&#39;s. I&#39;ll be in Texas. Stock up on food, gold/silver, ammo, and etc and good luck</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Satanists believe &quot;Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law.&quot;</p>

<p>When the rule of [man&#39;s] law is suspended, people who do not adhere to the laws of God will indeed devolve into barbarians.</p>

<p>Those who worship God and obey His commands think frequently of the Hereafter, but those who do not expect a Day of Judgement and the Afterlife only fear imprisonment in this world; the only thing keeping unbelieving people from committing crimes is the legal system. When &quot;do what you want&quot; becomes the only law, many people will steal, rape and murder without fear of any consequences.</p>

<p>This is the idea behind The Purge films. Watch this brief trailer for The Purge: Election Year:</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/N8zd8JnHkfw">https://youtu.be/N8zd8JnHkfw</a></p>

<p>&quot;...celebrate the purge that <em>trumps</em> them all.&quot;</p>

<p>Also note that it is &quot;TV Spot 33&quot;, of all numbers.</p>

<p>The collapse of America would inevitably lead to global instability. Out of chaos, the occult elite hope to bring about a global government with a single leader; Christians call him the Antichrist, and Muslims call him ad-Dajjal (&quot;The Deceiver&quot;).</p>

<p>Those who believe in God and anticipate a Day when they will be told about the deeds they used to do ultimately have nothing on this Earth to fear. The ones who will panic and kill each other for resources like savages will be those who disbelieve.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Conflating satanism with thelema is about as intellectually dishonest as supporting Hobbes&#39; theory of man&#39;s natural state.</p>

<p>Open any book on anthropology and you&#39;ll find evidence that it&#39;s civilization, not nature, that makes men&#39;s lives nasty, brutish, and short.</p>

<p>Read any Thelemic text and you&#39;ll find that love is the law. The law of Thelema is &quot;Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law. Love is the law, love under will.&quot;</p>

<p>I dunno much about satanism, but generally accusations are lofted carelessly at anyone certain theists dislike. The Church of Satan is a bunch of self-assured atheists, so while I can see the similarities to Thelema, any accusations of devil worship seem unfactual.</p>

<p>Your assertions are full of shit and so are you. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Before converting to Islam, I was an Agnostic who was really into Marilyn Manson. I read extensively about Satanism. Whether these people are claiming to worship the self, Satan, some other &quot;deity&quot; or even multiple deities, at the end, they are worshipping Satan. They are doing his bidding. The jinn whisper evil thoughts into the hearts of human beings, and they serve Satan. When one acts on these thoughts, they are submitting to Satan. I don&#39;t bother to differentiate between all of these fantasy belief systems—they are all influenced by Satan, the trickster who seeks to deceive men. You will come to know.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What I mean by that is that after reading about all of the many religions during the decade that I identified as an Agnostic, I realized that, regardless of the differences between the names of the deities, all of these religious groups have been tricked into submitting to Satan. The Quran (&quot;Recitation&quot;) confirms this.</p>

<p>Chapter 4, &quot;The Women&quot;: verse 76</p>

<p><a href="https://quran.com/4/76">https://quran.com/4/76</a></p>

<p>&quot;Those who believe fight in the cause of Allah, and those who disbelieve fight in the cause of Taghut [rebellion, idolatry, limit crossing, boundary overstepping]. So fight against the allies of Satan. Indeed, the plot of Satan has ever been weak.&quot;</p>

<p>In the Quran, Allah (&quot;the Deity&quot;) tells us the story of the Prophet Abraham, upon whom there is peace. His father was a polytheist, worshipping multiple stone statues. Abraham, upon whom there is peace, told him not to worship Satan.</p>

<p>Chapter 19, &quot;Maryam&quot;: verses 41-48</p>

<p><a href="https://quran.com/19/41-48">https://quran.com/19/41-48</a></p>

<p>&quot;And mention in the Book [the story of] Abraham. Indeed, he was a man of truth and a prophet.</p>

<p>&quot;[Mention] when he said to his father, &#39;O my father, why do you worship that which does not hear and does not see and will not benefit you at all?</p>

<p>&quot;&#39;O my father, indeed there has come to me of knowledge that which has not come to you, so follow me; I will guide you to an even path.</p>

<p>&quot;&#39;<strong>O my father, do not worship Satan.</strong> Indeed Satan has ever been, to the Most Merciful, disobedient.</p>

<p>&quot;&#39;O my father, indeed I fear that there will touch you a punishment from the Most Merciful so you would be to Satan a companion [in Hellfire].&#39;</p>

<p>&quot;[His father] said, &#39;Have you no desire for my gods, O Abraham? If you do not desist, I will surely stone you, so avoid me a prolonged time.&#39;</p>

<p>&quot;[Abraham] said, &#39;Peace will be upon you. I will ask forgiveness for you of my Lord. Indeed, He is ever gracious to me.</p>

<p>&quot;And <strong>I will leave you and those you invoke other than Allah and will invoke my Lord</strong>. I expect that I will not be in invocation to my Lord unhappy.&#39;</p>

<p>These are but two examples.</p>

<p>Anything other than the three monotheistic, Abrahamic religions is Satan worship. I will no longer spend my time in this temporary, material world seeking to fully understand other nonsensical, mystical &quot;religions&quot; now that the truth has come to me from my Lord—the God of the Prophet Abraham, upon whom there is peace. I dabbled in everything, but now the truth is clear.</p>

<p>But, as the Quran also states, &quot;There is no compulsion [acceptance of] the religion. The right course has become clear from the wrong.&quot; </p>

<p><a href="https://quran.com/2/256">https://quran.com/2/256</a></p>

<p>We all have free will. Do with it what you will, even if that means following &quot;the left-hand path&quot;, but know that there are consequences, in this life and the next, for disbelief in and disobedience of your Creator.</p>

<p><a href="https://quran.com/38/71-88">https://quran.com/38/71-88</a></p>

<p>&quot;[So mention] when your Lord said to the angels, &#39;Indeed, I am going to create a human being from clay.</p>

<p>&quot;So when I have proportioned him and breathed into him of My [created] soul, then fall down to him in prostration.&#39;</p>

<p>&quot;So the angels prostrated - all of them entirely.</p>

<p>&quot;Except Iblees; he was arrogant and became among the disbelievers.</p>

<p>&quot;[ Allah ] said, &#39;O Iblees, what prevented you from prostrating to that which I created with My hands? Were you arrogant [then], or were you [already] among the haughty?&#39;</p>

<p>&quot;He said, &#39;I am better than him. You created me from fire and created him from clay.&#39;</p>

<p>&quot;[ Allah ] said, &#39;Then get out of Paradise, for indeed, you are expelled.</p>

<p>And indeed, upon you is My curse until the Day of Recompense.&#39;</p>

<p>&quot;He said, &#39;My Lord, then reprieve me until the Day they are resurrected.&#39;</p>

<p>&quot;[ Allah ] said, &#39;So indeed, you are of those reprieved</p>

<p>Until the Day of the time well-known.&#39;</p>

<p>&quot;[Iblees] said, &#39;By your might, I will surely mislead them all</p>

<p>Except, among them, Your chosen servants.&#39;</p>

<p>&quot;[ Allah ] said, &#39;The truth [is My oath], and the truth I say -</p>

<p>&quot;&#39;[That] I will surely fill Hell with you and those of them that follow you all together.&#39;</p>

<p>&quot;Say, [O Muhammad], &#39;I do not ask you for the Qur&#39;an any payment, and I am not of the pretentious</p>

<p>&quot;&#39;It is but a reminder to the worlds.</p>

<p>&quot;&#39;And you will surely know [the truth of] its information after a time.&#39;&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://quran.com/38/71-88">https://quran.com/38/71-88</a></p>

<p>&quot;[So mention] when your Lord said to the angels, &#39;Indeed, I am going to create a human being from clay.</p>

<p>&quot;So when I have proportioned him and breathed into him of My [created] soul, then fall down to him in prostration.&#39;</p>

<p>&quot;So the angels prostrated - all of them entirely.</p>

<p>&quot;Except Iblees; he was arrogant and became among the disbelievers.</p>

<p>&quot;[ Allah ] said, &#39;O Iblees, what prevented you from prostrating to that which I created with My hands? Were you arrogant [then], or were you [already] among the haughty?&#39;</p>

<p>&quot;He said, &#39;I am better than him. You created me from fire and created him from clay.&#39;</p>

<p>&quot;[ Allah ] said, &#39;Then get out of Paradise, for indeed, you are expelled.</p>

<p>And indeed, upon you is My curse until the Day of Recompense.&#39;</p>

<p>&quot;He said, &#39;My Lord, then reprieve me until the Day they are resurrected.&#39;</p>

<p>&quot;[ Allah ] said, &#39;So indeed, you are of those reprieved</p>

<p>Until the Day of the time well-known.&#39;</p>

<p>&quot;[Iblees] said, &#39;By your might, I will surely mislead them all</p>

<p>Except, among them, Your chosen servants.&#39;</p>

<p>&quot;[ Allah ] said, &#39;The truth [is My oath], and the truth I say -</p>

<p>&quot;&#39;[That] I will surely fill Hell with you and those of them that follow you all together.&#39;</p>

<p>&quot;Say, [O Muhammad], &#39;I do not ask you for the Qur&#39;an any payment, and I am not of the pretentious</p>

<p>&quot;&#39;It is but a reminder to the worlds.</p>

<p>&quot;&#39;And you will surely know [the truth of] its information after a time.&#39;&quot;</p>
