<p>And no.  Once again.  Did you have internet when it was created or did it roll out to you?  </p>

<p>Do you pay for it as a service?  </p>

<p>Is your information collected?</p>

<p>You claim it is saving us but it was given TO us.  The internet itself is a catch 22.  They developed it to speed up profit gain but risk connectivity of the worker class.  Now they use it to bide time by spreading misinformation and breeding useful idiots that don&#39;t think critically about the very thing that is being used to train them.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>ok yeah..i&#39;m drinking so i&#39;m probably not in my best form.  although some might argue otherwise.</p>

<p>the internet is literally a road for information to flow on.  look up on how it&#39;s designed.  but even if you don&#39;t do that, know this - all signals vibrate.  those vibrations can be picked up by external listeners, as they are <em>broadcasts</em>.  </p>

<p>roads are good.  where you have shitty roads (slow or narrow) you have poverty.  roads are arteries of information, ultimately.  absent the bandwidth, information isn&#39;t exchanged and common benefits aren&#39;t realized.  there&#39;s a direct correlation between road quality and wealth (excluding those areas where the elite congregate in part because the roads are shite).  it makes sense.  the less you exchange the less you learn.  </p>

<p>The pure coincidence of cern creating the internet gives me a bad feeling that I&#39;m onto at least something with my line of thinking despite the seeming innocence and naturalness of the internet.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a tool to the elite and like freedom of speech they cannot stop us from saying anything, but they can now collect it and use it.</p>

<p>I&#39;d love the internet to be idealistic but almost every other topic where money is to be made is subverted.  I think it&#39;s time we question the validity of what we&#39;re banking on so much.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>anyone can post anything and seem like an authority on anything.  that is simply not true. in this phase of tech dev.  its safe to say... the internet is comprimised. largely by greed and mismanagement. everyone wants money for nothing. flip side is the functional uses and benefits outweigh the asshattery of the Military Industrial Complex.  Office for Information Awareness.... lol. still cant figure out what to do with all that data. why dont you get some more harddrives. that always kinda works. where do you think big marketing gets their &quot;real&quot; demographic data from? Government selling back to businesses with fronted companies providing &#39;media awareness&#39;.  wheeeee. its all a big cluster hump.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That euphoria is the magic of technology winning over an entire generation.  </p>

<p>My point was that could have been what they were selling it as while the real purposes remained nefarious.  </p>

<p>I know it&#39;s kind of a strawman example but look at how the law is set up to make us think it protects us but it really creates new polls for the wealthy criminals and sets up a form of taxation on the lower classes that get caught up.  </p>
