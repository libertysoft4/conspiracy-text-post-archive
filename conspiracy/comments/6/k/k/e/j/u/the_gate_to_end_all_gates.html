<p>Search: Stratfor clinton foundation furniture pizza cheese walnuts wedding books dog pillows (possibly beer?) (and probably a lot more code, just look for repeating patterns that seem out of place)</p>

<p>cards = access to CP/children/women/etc. -&gt; blackmail
furniture = arms
wedding = assassination?
dog = ?
books = ?
The other code words you know.</p>

<p>This is what FBIAnon was talking about. We know HRC struck deals with foreign governments for favors. According to FBIAnon, these favors included intel, guns, and people. He said to look out for cards. They&#39;re credit cards, with which you can donate to the foundation in return for the &quot;favors&quot;. It happened, and probably still happens on a massive scale. We can&#39;t let them get away with this.</p>

<p>Edit: Look for more in the Wikileaks files, it&#39;s all there, believe me. Think tip of the iceberg. Think big picture. This is what FBIAnon was talking about, this has the potential to bring down many powerful people in many countries, as well as some governments as a whole, I imagine. Go watch black mirror, especially season 3, episode 3. Look for the card lists stratfort made, make backups, just in case. You&#39;ll find many email addresses, but remember - they&#39;re just people.</p>

<p>Edit2: I have to go to work now, after a sleepless night. Hope to be back soon. Be good. Believe. Peace.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well fuck me, but unless I see the headline &quot;U.S. government sells child sex slaves and illegal arms with help of intelligence agencies and military&quot; I don&#39;t think this story is quite dead yet. Remember FBIAnon. He wanted us to find it and spread it, because they couldn&#39;t due to immense political and internal pressure. If enough people called their congressman, the news, their mom and their mail man about this, then they can act. They need all eyes on this an dpublic pressure to reach critical mass. Wouldn&#39;t this be perfect for independence day? We know the FBI has enough intel to bring the whole circus down. I think it&#39;s time we helped them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve noticed weird internet/PC slowdowns during the last few weeks. Sometimes my upload speed is virtually non-existent. My brand new phone now has an interference noise most of the time that it didn&#39;t have before.

    <div class="md"><p>Fine, go digging in the files yourself then. I&#39;m saying it ends there. I&#39;m saying this is the key to finding the files that actually matter and how to read them. FBIAnon always said, all we needed was in the files, but that it would be coded. Now we know the code and where exactly to look. If you want sth. new, go look at Austin&#39;s Pizza&#39;s link to stratfor. Look at Ahold. This is the real rabbit hole and it goes <em>deep</em>. I know it&#39;s not aliens, only people. Real people, real children. Hell, I&#39;m not even American, but we should all be mad about this, because this network is so vast even I couldn&#39;t believe it at first.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Have you read everything that FBIAnon said? Studied it carefully? If not, do so, then look at the files again and start digging for more. Imagine a network so massive it boggles the mind. Like that scene in the Wire, when the FBI agent can&#39;t find the drugs in the shipping container until he realizes it&#39;s all drugs. Think in terms of a network that would put Gustavo Fring&#39;s one to shame. We know the symbols they like to use. We know they have they&#39;re people in all the places that matter. How do move product in these kinds of quantities? You make it seem legit. Search the stratfor leaks with the filters I&#39;ve mentioned. You&#39;ll see it.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve noticed weird internet/PC slowdowns during the last few weeks. Sometimes my upload speed is virtually non-existent. My brand new phone now has an interference noise most of the time that it didn&#39;t have before. Often messages sent via FB/Whatsapp take upwards of ten minutes to reach my friends, although I can see we&#39;re both online and internet is working normally. I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s a fact, but it&#39;s quite probable assuming these people are actually doing their jobs. </p>
