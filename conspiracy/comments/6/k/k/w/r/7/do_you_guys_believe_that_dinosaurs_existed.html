<p>Add to that the merchandising of dinosaurs to children specifically and it just feels force fed and fishy.  </p>

<p>In all of science, the bullshitometer is pretty high when it comes to dinosaurs.</p>

<p>People can laugh all they want.  It&#39;s just a sign that they haven&#39;t calmly looked into reasons to contradict their own beliefs.  If they had, they&#39;d understand the argument and help the person to reason because they understand the journey.  </p>

<p>that doesn&#39;t make any sense. what are you trying to say?</p>

<p>the sciences are a traditional part of academics and have a history of being knowledge for the sake of knowledge. if you disagree with that premise then what knowledge is sacred then? are all academics part of a conspiracy to control people? are all scientists in on it? i was kind of joking with you because that&#39;s the only reaction i can have to someone claiming the sciences are false because people make a living through them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think that&#39;s obvious at all. It certainly wasn&#39;t obvious for Darwin who was already independently wealthy, or Einstein who never profited from his ideas to the extent others did. Jay Gould and the other modern biologists make a living but they&#39;re not worshiped and they&#39;re not rich. Name me the ten most influential biologists of the last 100 years. Exactly. I&#39;ve heard those arguments before, from Christian fundamentalists actually, and it&#39;s a preposterous hypothesis. The science is built on the shoulders of others and is carried and improved upon by the nameless, un-monied masses; not by the rich and famous, or powerful and unscrupulous. it&#39;s not religion because it&#39;s not dogma. The entire point of science is to test hypotheses, old and new. If something becomes canon, it&#39;s because theories have passed rigorous tests, but you know this already. I don&#39;t even know why I&#39;d bother with someone&#39;s ideas that somehow all peer reviews, etc, are part of a mass, global conspiracy. </p>

<p>Over thousands of millions of students through the generations? It would have to be such a powerful ideology that it would have to <em>virtually</em> be true, which is exactly what science claims to be in the first place.</p>

<p>What&#39;s hardest for me is, so you had evolution plus a multitude of years and got the Jurassic periods (not entirely sure what you&#39;d call it) and then you had a great extinction, and then it all restarted? Why didn&#39;t we see the rise of dinosaurs again? Why did evolution take a different turn of events..granted I don&#39;t know much on evolution and generally just spit ball ideas before speaking so please be gentle.</p>

<p>Even further than that you&#39;d need an International Agency to pull off something like that. Dinosaur fossils are found all over the world, it&#39;d be practically impossible to create this a few hundred years ago and keep it going until today all across the world. </p>

<p>Evolution is random. It&#39;s not just nature trying to get from point A to point B. It&#39;s possible that whatever made them go extinct just made it impossible for them to ever come back. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Even among my most hardcore religious friends, dinosaurs are a fact. </p>

<p>My one friend&#39;s parents believe that the world is only 10000 years old tops, that humans once lived to be 300 years old before the flood and that dinosaurs and humans lived together until they started getting to bloodthirsty, at which point God smote them all. </p>

<p>I can personally believe a few dinos managed to survive whatever cataclysm killed their kind and would eventually spawn stories of dragons in Asia and medieval Europe. I&#39;m not even going to say that there aren&#39;t a few rare stragglers hiding some place man has yet to conquer, but until we find some definitive proof of it, I refuse to believe Adam was playing the role of Fred Flintstone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do what 19th century geologists did. Find a river cut - a place where a river has deeply eroded the earth. At the surface you will find bones of creatures that live on the planet today. Move deeper down the cut (back in time). The bones you find will be of creatures that do not live on our planet today. As you go deeper, the evolution of different species is revealed.  Usually, but not always, a species becomes more complex as it evolves.  Then, something happens in it&#39;s environment and poof, all gone.</p>

<p>This is not difficult to do yourself, some occult science or a rich man&#39;s trick.  The obvious answer is evolution and the extinction of millions of species.</p>
