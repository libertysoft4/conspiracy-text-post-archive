<p>I believe their software could easily be re-conditioned to use in an advanced seismic prediction model (for what its worth), simply by making the level of Solar intensity (to viable crime severity), and the city wide location sectors, to a 344 segmented latitude / longitude grid on earth. </p>

<p>Taking these initial data points in comparison to the bz componet and the solar wind feeds sequenced events. We may be able to define a measurable algorithm of events which extract the data sets necessary to locate a potential seismic event on earth upto five days in advance. </p>

<p>I hope to find a correlation such as this one: THE NEPAL EARTHQUAKE AND SPACE WEATHER: High above Earth, more than 60 km above sea level, there is a layer of our planet&#39;s atmosphere called &quot;the ionosphere.&quot; It is where UV radiation from the sun strips electrons away from the atoms of normal air, creating a zone of charged gas that envelopes the globe.</p>

<p>The ionosphere is very sensitive to solar storms. Turns out, it can be sensitive to earthquakes, too. NASA is reporting that the magnitude 7.8 earthquake in Nepal on April 25th created waves of energy that penetrated the ionosphere and disturbed the distribution of electrons. Note the wave pattern, circled, in the upper panel of this ionospheric electron density plot:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.spaceweather.com/images2015/02may15/nepal_strip.gif">1</a>, <a href="http://www.spaceweather.com/images2015/02may15/nepal_strip.gif">2</a></p>

<p><em>Basically, these are waves of electron density rippling from a point in the ionosphere above the epicenter of the quake. The waves were measured by a science-quality GPS receiver in Lhasa, Tibet. It took about 21 minutes for the waves to travel 400 miles between the epicenter and the GPS receiving station.</em></p>

<p>The bottom panel of the plot is a &quot;dynamic spectrum.&quot; Note the hot spots outlined in black. They show that the ionosphere was ringing with periods of ~2 and ~8 minutes. Presumably, these &quot;tones&quot; are related to atmospheric pressure waves billowing up from the trembling Earth below.</p>

<p>The ionosphere is the stage upon which much of space weather plays out. Auroras, meteors, and noctilucent clouds all occur there. The &quot;Ionosphere Natural Hazards Team&quot; at JPL studies how Earth itself affects this stage via earthquakes, volcanoes and tsunamis. You can read their report about the Nepal earthquake...</p>

<p>I&#39;m not familiar with it.  It&#39;s a SaaS of some sort.  Anywhere you can run node.js or open a browser instance is where you can run javascript.  Bluemix is able to run node, so it would work.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi</p>

<p>Throwaway here.</p>

<p>I study space weather (post-grad level). I don&#39;t think what you are attempting is going to work for multiple reasons. </p>

<p>First problem: the mechanism you&#39;ve proposed for CMEs or the solar wind to affect plate tectonics doesn&#39;t make any sense. How is it that the solar wind, with pressures of  a few nP in the atmosphere is going to affect plate tectonics to a point that they move? Even if you assume that they only &#39;trigger&#39; earthquakes (as in, release stored potential energy as opposed to moving the earth), you haven&#39;t explained how what you are proposing makes sense.</p>

<p>Second thing: Earthquakes happen all the time. Geomagnetic storms and sub-storms happen all the time. It&#39;s quite likely that you will make a connection between two such events that are entirely meaningless.</p>

<p>Third: I think you are confusing &#39;tectonics --&gt; ionospheric changes&#39; with &#39;ionospheric changes --&gt; tectonics&#39;. If I wave my hand, I can put out a candle across a room. If someone else puts out a candle across a room, it doesn&#39;t mean that my hand is going to move.</p>

<p>Finally, even if there was some link between the ionosphere causing earthquakes, and you were able to prove this somehow, you would still have an extremely difficult problem with predicting space weather. As you pointed out in your post, a CME may not even hit the Earth. If it does hit the Earth, its Bz may be northward directed, and it will be less geoeffective... this is a common problem with space weather, and many scientists&#39; whole job is dedicated to solving this problem empirically with machine learning (kind of like what you are trying with space weather --&gt; earthquakes).</p>

<p>If you can solve this (which an entire field is dedicated to), you will be lauded, and probably make some money.</p>

<p>Anywho, good luck with your work.</p>
