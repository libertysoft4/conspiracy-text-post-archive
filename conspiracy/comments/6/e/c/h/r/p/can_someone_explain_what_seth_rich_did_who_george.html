    <div class="md"><p>Seth Rich was a DNC data analyst who found some dirty dealings within the campaign. He sought to get the word out about this corruption by contacting wikileaks who then released the emails. Seth was subsequently murdered, while the DNC tried to spin the release of emails as a Russian hacking. There&#39;s no investigation into Seth&#39;s murder, so we don&#39;t know for sure he did it, but it seems pretty obvious that the DNC had him offed for leaking. George Webb seems to have found out who killed him, but again we don&#39;t know for sure. But again, it&#39;s all pretty obvious what has happened and that the DNC is scrambling to cover their asses. </p>

<p>I think that about sums it up. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes the US Attorney’s office for the District of Columbia is currently investigating the Seth Rich case.</p>

<p>Steven Wasserman, is the Assistant US Attorney for DC.. Debbie Wasserman Schultz&#39;s brother.  (Debbie Wasserman Schultz’s of course was the Head of the DNC when Seth Rich was murdered).  So, you can be sure that investigation will be impartial.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve used this sub for years, and all of a sudden i&#39;m being downvoted by people like you because i don&#39;t see the benefit in a circlejerk of half truths and you&#39;re acting like it&#39;s my job to do this sort of thing.</p>

<p>Why? Why are you and your buddies so intent on never discussing the facts, or acting like facts are oppressive and stop free thinking for things that benefit you? There&#39;s an actual conspiracy going on here that half this sub is ignoring, and it&#39;s that people who are likely to be critical thinkers have suddenly stopped employing it at all and are now targeting those that do in an attempt to make any discussion here entirely pointless.</p>

<p>Who has convinced half this sub that they need to verify EVERYTHING anti-trump and never question anything pro-trump and why are you guys doing it with such fervor? Do you even know you&#39;re doing it?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The unbiased series of events is Seth was murdered on his way home one night. He was shit two times in the back, and did not die right away, instead he lasted some time in the hospital before passing on. </p>

<p>The police determined that it was likely a botched robbery based on a torn wrist strap to Seth&#39;s watch and a string of robberies in the area. </p>

<p>Due to the timing of Seth&#39;s murder some people have theorized that he was the DNC leaker, however that has yet to be verified with clear evidence and all of the &quot;evidence&quot; currently available is circumstantial. Things working against this theory are several fake pieces of evidence that have been pushed forward and later debunked, and much of the narrative coming from 4chan anons.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>DNC and Podesta emails revealing the shady dealings of the Democratic party were leaked or hacked and were published by wikileaks. The democrats wanted to shift the focus from the content of the emails to where they came from, accusing Russia. The Seth Rich story brings back the focus away from Russia.</p>

<p>Careful not to spread misinformation, nobody knows who killed Seth Rich, or who gave the order to do... yet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re trying to ostracize the people who care that the discussions we have are using sourced information, or when something is speculation that it is labeled as such, not stated to be fact and then for the hive mind to down vote anyone who asks for the source or corrects a lie.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve used this sub for years, and all of a sudden i&#39;m being downvoted by people like you because i don&#39;t see the benefit in a circlejerk of half truths and you&#39;re acting like it&#39;s my job to do this sort of thing.</p>

<p>Why? Why are you and your buddies so intent on never discussing the facts, or acting like facts are oppressive and stop free thinking for things that benefit you? There&#39;s an actual conspiracy going on here that half this sub is ignoring, and it&#39;s that people who are likely to be critical thinkers have suddenly stopped employing it at all and are now targeting those that do in an attempt to make any discussion here entirely pointless.</p>

<p>Who has convinced half this sub that they need to verify EVERYTHING anti-trump and never question anything pro-trump and why are you guys doing it with such fervor? Do you even know you&#39;re doing it?</p>
