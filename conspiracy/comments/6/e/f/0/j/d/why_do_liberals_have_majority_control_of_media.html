It won&#39;t be marketed as a cost saver but that will be the result of it.

<p>So for her, those things were so unbelievable and unfathomable.  For me, shows like Timeless (time travel change history for/against TPTB) or Stargate (portal to other worlds created by ancient race) etc could come out in full disclosure and I&#39;d be like &#39;damn, thought it was&#39;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is such a funny concept.  Here&#39;s the flaw in that perception:</p>

<p>1) since mid-90s (Telecommunications Act), the wall between the profit-averse &quot;news&quot; divisions and the profit-driven entertainment divisions has been removed.</p>

<p>2) that means that over the last 30 years, the &quot;news&quot; has served a single master: profit</p>

<p>3) add in the five transnationals that now largely own everything you read, see and hear</p>

<p>4) on the boards of the transnational corporate parents are people with a financial stake in the industries the &quot;news&quot; media should be keeping its eyes on</p>

<p>5) those two phenomena combine to pull off the miracle the financial elite has been praying for since the First Amendment was enshrined in the Constitution:  to smother freedom of the press.</p>

<p>Liberals wish they had majority control of the media.  Democrats too.  (not the same thing in my mind)  The idiology that has a chokehold on the media is <strong>greed</strong> and the particular brand of greed you find in the elite classes.  </p>

<p>Ftfy.  If the &quot;historical documents&quot; are like the ones in Galaxy Quest, I&#39;m in.

    <div class="md"><p>You can selectively parse bits from &quot;historical documents&quot; to build a fairytale around whatever villain you fancy but while you&#39;re railing against the Termites <em>real</em> villains are purchasing your democracy as cheaply as a beat-up pair of work gloves right before your very eyes - no parsing necessary.  You want to ignore them because they don&#39;t fit the ethnic/cultural/religious type you want to blame, that&#39;s on you.  What&#39;s happening <em>right now</em> has been escalating for decades <em>in plain sight</em> - you just have to open your eyes instead of trying to shoehorn the painfully obvious ills of our current cultural/political/economic landscape into some Rube Goldbergian timeline that starts with Zionists.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not &quot;blaming&quot; anyone. I pointed out that a well documented book laid out the historical facts demonstrating how it began in the 30&#39;s and has evolved into what it is today.   If the finger points to the  Zionists rather than the Cossacks or the Catholics or even the Haitians, that&#39;s where it points.  </p>

<p>I resent that you accuse me of having ethic/cultural/religious motivations, why can&#39;t it ever just be what it is... history pointing to someone YOU&#39;D rather it didn&#39;t point to?  I see what&#39;s occurring today.  I see the dual citizenship politicians, the billions in aid, the Palestinian conflict.  </p>

<p>Maybe if you actually read the book.... found discrepancies in it.... rather than accuse me of a fairy tale.     </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If there wasn&#39;t an entirely sound, highly visible foundation for understanding the direct hand a small number of corporate elites and families have had on the current rot in our entire cultural/political/economic structure, facilitated by &quot;conservative&quot; SCOTUS Justices extra-Constitutionally legislating from the bench, I might turn to a book like that in desperation.  There&#39;s no shortage of unacknowledged conspiracies that have had and continue to have a profoundly negative impact on us and our world, and I&#39;ve been down the Zionists rabbit hole once already and found it lacking.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll read it carefully, Thanks for the info.  But a question... what makes it feasible that a lot of connected CEOS, elites and others have collaborated to do as you say but makes it seem not possible for an organized and cohesive group like the Zionists not to?   Plotting the long game seems like it would need a bond that over rides  the natural competitiveness (greed)  that the elites would have for each other.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not that it&#39;s not possible, but one thing that has come through loud and clear throughout my life, bearing out in all the relevant conversations I&#39;ve had, people I&#39;ve met, books I&#39;ve read or places I&#39;ve worked, is that virtually anything is possible if you throw enough money at it and underneath the perceived agenda of any efficient and effective campaign, movements, conspiracy or war is a <em>real</em> agenda, which is a more powerful motivator and facilitator than any ideology, belief, group or any other organizing factor - and that&#39;s greed.  So, #1, you have to have a lot of money to invest, or the resources and/or power to get your hands on it; and #2, there has to be a mechanism in place or waiting at the other end for generating, increasing or monopolizing profits.  That&#39;s my litmus test.  If in that book there&#39;s evidence that a Zionist conspiracy yielded what I just described as powerfully and comprehensively as the corporate and financial elite has in the US and abroad, then you might be on to something. Otherwise, it&#39;s a dead end.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As a matter of fact, it did specifically mention the Zionist plan to infiltrate the highest ranks of government and industry.  This was back in the 30&#39;s and 40&#39;s.  I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a coincidence that many media leaders, Wall Street bankers, Federal government officials are Jewsih while admitting not all Jews are Zionists. I think the organization was used for forming a Jewish homeland in the 40&#39;s and evolved into a plan for a &quot;Greater Israel&quot; currently and eventual world governance in the near future.  I think the Paris deal Trump just canceled was part of this globalist plan.      </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can&#39;t have it both ways - the globalist plan is a cancer but if you look at some of the biggest funders and pushers of globalism lie they ain&#39;t Zionists (unless the sovereign corporate nation of Exxon-Mobil and Monsanto-Bayer are masterminded by Zionists, which, last I checked, they weren&#39;t).  Would it make sense for Zionists to entrust the fate of their plan to whatever the Zionist version of infidel is?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, truth has a liberal bias. And which news do you think they control?</p>

<p>I follow about 600 TV stations on twitter (US stations) and a you find many of them belong to a handful of companies - and corporations are the ones conservatives want to control the US. </p>

<p>Is it your ideal that if anyone criticizes the current president it makes them liberal? What does that make rush, hannity, fox, etc (and you do know most all talk radio is run by RW&#39;ers, right?).</p>

<p>So tell me which media out of them all in the US? NYT/WaPo/NBC? 3 maybe that lean left compared to hundreds (and not to mention radio and newspapers that lean right).</p>

<p>There is a myth that media is leftists - it is propaganda from the right to cover their ass without addressing the facts.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Fox News averaged 1.72 million total day viewers, with 359,000 of those falling in the key adults 25-54 demo. CNN finished second with 826,000 total day viewers and 266,000 viewers in the demo. MSNBC came in third with 781,000 total day viewers and 185,000 viewers in the demo. Yet despite finishing third, MSNBC definitely has reason to celebrate. The network grew its viewership by 55 percent in total day viewers and 40 percent in the key demo compared to quarter one of 2016</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Those numbers are a fucking joke when you consider there are 340 million people in the USA.</p>

<p>Alex jones has 2million subscribers to his youtube channel alone.</p>

<p>I heard a joke, I think it was on the Joe Rogan &gt; Alex Jones podcast, where Alex says no one is watching the mainstream news. The only place you&#39;ll find it on a tv is in nursing homes. That&#39;s their audience.</p>
