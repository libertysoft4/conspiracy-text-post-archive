<p>Well your intent would be ambiguous if that was all you wrote.  But you also wrote &quot;Why should we believe you?&quot;, before that.  This colours your statements with a validity smell and an expectation that OP needs to fulfill your questions, and that otherwise there&#39;s no reason OP should be posting.  That&#39;s how it reads anyway.  I&#39;m sure you can try to spin your intent some other way, so please carry on trying.</p>

<p>You chose the term &quot;conform&quot; (implying an order), not I.  So you&#39;re strawmanning here, injecting terms that the other party didn&#39;t use and then accusing them of using those terms.  Hahahaha.  Hilarious.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s clear you asked for further explanation that, if absent, would necessitate you not caring about the subject.  So, applying your rationale to your own comments - why should we care whether about your standards were met?  What&#39;s the point of posting about your standards in a public forum, absent further explanation?  </p>

<p>The best part of this exchange is the demonstration that you&#39;re incapable of seeing your own hypocrisy.      </p>

<p>100% paranoid schizophrenia doesn&#39;t exist, people never delude themselves into believing things are happening that aren&#39;t, and it&#39;s a widespread practice for people to invest massive amounts of time and money just to harass random people on the internet for &quot;reasons&quot;.</p>

<p>No one is denying the possibility of orchestrated harassment, but not every person who claims they are being &quot;gang stalked&quot; is actually experiencing this sort of harassment. It&#39;s much more likely there is another explanation.</p>
