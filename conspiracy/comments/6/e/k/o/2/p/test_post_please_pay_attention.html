<p>I, OR OTHERS WHO POST SIMILAR IDEAS or questions about the formentioned, will be downvoted into distant memory or propelled into 15 minutes of fame, seemingly on a whim, or, in my most recent opinion, thrust upon a discedited or flimsy excuse, trivialized by an artificially inflated top comment  or chain of misdirection which almost always is a Subversion. In either case to be dumped into the sea of silence.</p>

<p>What can we (or I, or us, or you) do differently to catch the attention of the near half-million subscribers in this sub, or the attention of the near half-million shadow subs, so as to help them ALL realize we are one in the same and being blinded by small, temporary, seemingly big at the moment but competly trivial distracions? Certainly there are auto-up and auto-downs happening, but if we cannot get an actual discussion and/or debunking of things to add or remove to the list above, we have been reduced to the whims of keywords and auto actions of (people) accounts which are not even actually here. </p>

<p>SO, my question is, which way does the wind blow and will we, the USERS of this sub, lean with or against the wind which wishes to scatter us into itself?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This post is about the law of averages and the willingness of the real life people to speak up, out, or inward about these topics. We commonly discuss these &#39;common topics&#39; which you have so eloquently pointed out in my obviously long list of common topics. I am trying to help the community break apart from amd rise above the pack which has taken us over and, discuss on a deeper level these and other issues. Does tha make me or my ideas wrong? There is NOTHING average about the list which I have presented, except your response to it.</p>

<p>I have a simple multi-part question for you, do you want to help, do you want to dissect, do you want to help advance this community and the discussions we should be having on a daily basis or do you want to solidify yourself as one who is only wiling to pass over the most obvious for that which makes you most comfortable? </p>

I appreciate your encouragement but we need your input and expertise, broad or narrow as it may be, to bring to light that which others may not, cannot, or are not willing to accept. We truly need each other and the others, however they may feel, need us.

    <div class="md"><p>You can&#39;t catch anyone&#39;s attention unless they are first willing to look.</p>

<p>If they are willing to look, then they probably already know much of what you speak of, or at least are willing to look if you are willing to explain.</p>

<p>My advice is simply to do your best to educate individuals where you see an opportunity to do so. Reaching one person is far more effective than trying to break through a wall of lemmings.</p>

If you are unwilling to even consider the possibility of the powers that be collaberating on ways to increase and maintain those powers, then you&#39;re already balls deep in the &quot;catnip&quot;. Enjoy the Bliss of ignorance. When your children are without essential freedoms, feel free to blame yourself and others like you. Open your eyes. Take a look for yourself. Form your truth intelligently based on what&#39;s going on around you and who benefits. Or continue to formulate one-line criticisms of those who are concerned with the state of things country.

At least I  cared enough to read it but I&#39;m not a kid in the basement of my parents home with time to spare.   Grow up and learn to laugh a little.

<p>The shill bombardment won&#39;t make the pizzagate or seth rich stuff go away, atleast for me.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been here since post-DNC nomination, im not a real member of this sub, more like CTR-cranked-up-to-11-on-r/politics put me here.</p>

<p>Seen&#39;t things while Ive been here, but I have just one question</p>

<p>Why did the former president meet with james alefantis, a pizza parlour owner?</p>

<p>The co-ordination that goes forth everyday to try and destroy this conspiracy is like nothing i&#39;ve seen, anchors and pundits doing a pile on. (coming from someone who believes theres shill efforts to establish racism/anti-semitism as part of the conspiracy theorists mindset - That we&#39;re just a bunch of Nazis)</p>

<p>Being against the wholesale destruction of middleast means your literally hitler, absolute insanity.</p>

<p>I just dont know what to believe anymore, perhaps assange before he went MIA when his net was cut, so pizzagate and seth rich</p>
