        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>JRR Tolkien, along with CS Lewis and others, was a member of a society of writers known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inklings">Inklings</a>. They wrote books that exposed Satanism and control by the elites through metaphors, with the Lord of the Rings and Chronicles as the most prominent examples.</p>

<p>The Two Towers  represent the two pillars of Freemasonry, as does the All-Seeing Eye of Sauron on the top. They also may represent the French and English Grand Lodges that competed for many centuries for dominance.</p>

<p>The Ring of Power represents dark occultism. Its only real power is to make the wearer invisible (symbols to hide one&#39;s intentions from the public) but it makes one visible to the Ring Wraiths (other dark occultists). </p>

<p>Using the Ring corrupts the wearer, and none have been able to completely destroy dark occultism. Isildur&#39;s name means &quot;devoted to the moon&quot; a reference to ISIS worship. His failure to destroy the ring could refer to the failure of the Israelites to destroy the dark occultists in Babylon (or many other historical events).</p>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Silmarillion">Silmarillion</a> is an expansion of the lore and contains many hidden truths. It refers to an ancient Island kingdom (Atlantis) that was destroyed when they failed to kill the leader of the evil forces, and he slowly corrupted them, until their island was destroyed, and they fled to the ends of Middle Earth.</p>

<p>A few years ago, a previously lost <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p7jFcnnE4U">recording</a> of JRR Tolkien was recovered. In it, he explains how the Lord of the Rings is actually a metaphor for the evil people ruling the world; there are followers of the evil wizards, and the good people of the world (hobbits) need to work together to defeat them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I would add that Saturn is Nimrod. Ive been researching the Mystery Babylon and Saturn worship for a bit now, and I believe that Saturn is representative of Nimrod. It is possible that since Uranus is a Titan, perhaps Nimrod&#39;s father Cush was also a giant, maybe how Melkor is a giant compared to Sauron?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s unlikely that Cush was a Nephilim. Noah&#39;s 3 sons were brought onto the Ark because they weren&#39;t a product of the Nephilim. So it would have to be basically the 1st generation of offspring off the ark (Ham then Cush) corrupted.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a possibility, however. And it would explain why Nimrod instituted Mystery Babylon.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well we know that the sons of Cain were destroyed but what about the daughters of Cain? Maybe the curse of Ham is that he mated with a daughter of Cain, maybe his mother. Nimrod marries his mother, which I think is part of the reason why royalty does too, to maintain a high amount of Nephilim DNA, some claim this is annunaki. </p>

<p>I was about to explain things until I came across this. You can confirm basic archaeological facts are accurate, even if you think some details are wrong. This is an insane statement.</p>

<p>Your faith is in intellectual pride, and I do not engage with anyone so prideful they believe it is beneath them to even consider other people&#39;s ideas, while blindly accepting outrageous claims from their own side.</p>

<p>You&#39;re making fun of me for being illogical and you start your post trying to prove a negative?</p>

<p>There&#39;s multiple 1st century sources referring to Nazareth. Who told you this?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>No great mass of people who spent forty years in the desert.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you believe the regular Egyptology timeline. Check out Graham Hancock, it&#39;s all bullshit.</p>

<p>If you put the events where the Bible actually puts them, not the re-framed dates based on Egyptology, there&#39;s tons of evidence, including the destruction of Jericho, with a completely destroyed wall, exactly where the Bible puts it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>No contemporary reports of miracles or Jesus</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There&#39;s the whole New Testament, which is composed of multiple authors from different cultures. </p>

<p>If your response is &quot;anything considered a sacred book won&#39;t also be considered as a historical document&quot; then don&#39;t bother responding, because you&#39;re not serious.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The current leading edge of research points to the creation of the Christian faith in the first instance, as a rebellion control device that comes from Rome. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Are you defending Jesus myth theory? Google it, there isn&#39;t a single scholar that holds that position, anywhere.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Glad to see in a sub dedicated to rational questioning of all sources that you have pulled the wool over your own eyes. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Glad to see your arguments are based on arrogance, not facts. Common problem among atheists, they substitute pride for critical thinking. </p>

<p>It&#39;s the main reason they are laughed at and not taken seriously by most of the planet. We can all see it, and you can&#39;t.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Challenging the years of intellectual dishonesty that you have subjected yourself to may well be the bitterest red pill to swallow. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;re so much smarter than the dumb Christians who rely on silly empiricism and evidence. It&#39;s all so easy, just circlejerk with other atheists about how much smarter you are than the &quot;profane&quot; religious people!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Certainly not trolling. It seems that the make believe world view with which you have saturated your judgement is preventing you from considering the possibility that the whole cosmogonic scheme is the biggest conspiracy of all. One which you are willing to sacrifice logic to. </p>

<p>As with most Christians you&#39;re probably cherry picking the parts of the bible that suit your agenda and support your ideas and ideals - you&#39;re most likely not truly following the word of the book because it&#39;s a mass of contradictions, a mess of philosophies that read like a palimpsest of a developing ideology and an ideology is all it is. Not a genuine set of records of an historical individual. </p>

<p>Consider Saul. His moment of revelation - temporary blindness, disassociative voices, hypnogogic visions and temporary paralysis all read like a description of a seizure. </p>

<p>Where are the contemporary reports outside of the bible? All of the reports are written outside of the eyewitness period. Josephus has been added to after his death to lend credibility to the early church. We know that it isn&#39;t Josephus writing as it isn&#39;t structured in the same way as his other writings. </p>

<p>The council of Nicea conducted the most obvious manipulation of texts - gone are the accounts of Jesus killing children, and the equality of women. It&#39;s been edited to suit the agenda of the church and the men who ran it. </p>

<p>Up next: morality is possible without an imaginary friend to celebrate your actions after your death. </p>

<p>overarching pride. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I know that you mean this as an insult as pride in the mythology of your religion is a &quot;sin&quot;, but telling someone who sees through the ecumenical devices and orchestrated suppression of people who are not questioning of the &quot;faith&quot; and the people who run it for their own power and money, doesn&#39;t actually carry any weight as an insult. </p>

<p>Your reply is also notable for the lack of any evidence of the existence of god to merely a handful of powerless personal slights. I would go so far as to point out the pride you have in your faith that means you can accept the obviously impossible without question. You are proud of not challenging the status quo of the religious institutions because it might have an effect on the post-mortem reward for living your life with restrictions imposed by a succession of men desperate for power and money. That&#39;s really something to be proud of, eh? </p>

<p>If you are not challenging your church about the vast sums of money they extort from their followers, hoard and invest in the stock market for profit, while the teachings in the bible point to getting the money out of the churches and into actually helping people who need help without reference to the need to believe, then you are merely an instrument of financial support to the enormously rich churches. </p>

<p>Challenge the authority of the church and the people who run it. It will make you more Christ like. I you won&#39;t, because you&#39;re cowed by being dazzled by the promise of heaven and terrified by being damned into hell. Both of which are substantially lacking in evidence of existing. </p>

<p>Be like your christ figure and fight the inequality, misery and suffering that the church enables, perpetuates and survives on. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think you will though. You don&#39;t have the capacity to. </p>

<p>Wrong. Proof you don&#39;t think for yourself, and are merely repeating memes you heard.</p>

<p>Why would I give you any? It would drive you further into your overweening pride that you know something when you know less than nothing.</p>

<p>Implying all Christians are greedy. More memes you heard from others.</p>

<p>What are you talking about? Pride is &quot;the sin of sins&quot; according to St Augustine of Hippo - it&#39;s a major component of the faith. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Why would I give you any? It would drive you further into your overweening pride that you know something when you know less than nothing.</p>

<p>So, there&#39;s no proof just embarrassingly weak insults. Got it. </p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>

<p>Implying all Christians are greedy. More memes you heard from others.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s amazing, but nowhere in that did I state &quot;all&quot;, but to deny the wealth of the institutions of religion is plain old lying, which is a sin, according to the bible. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s consider the value of religion in America, for example... The religious industry, and it is an industry, is worth $378B a year - but that is just the religious institutions. That&#39;s all tax free. When the broader picture of industries which are faith based is taken in to consideration, the figure is roughly $1T. One trillion. Literally enough to resolve 99.999% of social problems in the US alone, but that&#39;s primarily being used to line the pockets of people involved in the scam. That&#39;s terribly sad. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>How much of your money do you give away?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s not really your business to inquire, however, as a percentage of my income probably 15 - 20%. It&#39;s distributed amongst a range of charities which don&#39;t force the faith on the needy. </p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>You won&#39;t, because you&#39;re cowed by being dazzled by the promise of heaven and terrified by being damned into hell.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You don&#39;t even understand the BASIC teachings of Christianity. I know 5 year olds that are less ignorant.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is that your rebuttal? Lorksalordy that&#39;s weak. Really, really insipid. Vapid even. Try again. </p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Both of which are substantially lacking in evidence of existing. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You are not an empiricist. You are a fideist. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>And you are a fantasist. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>And I&#39;d wager money you had to look up both of those words.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh look, you&#39;re wrong again. I certainly don&#39;t think that faith is independent of reason. </p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>You don&#39;t have the capacity to. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You spent 20 minutes projecting memes you heard from others. Could have saved that time and just typed &quot;Brains!&quot; because you&#39;re an unthinking, unconscious zombie who will believe ANYTHING you are told if it appeals to your intellectual pride. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sorry, is that where you finish? With a childish insult. How weak. Nothing actually positive, just impotent ranting. </p>

<p>Where&#39;s the rest of your rebuttal? Why have you chosen to cherry pick these bits? It&#39;s almost as if cherry picking is a way of life for you. </p>

<p>I think it&#39;s probably best for you to get back to your make believe escapist fantasy rather than challenge the institutions of religion that are clearly corrupt, clearly run for the ego and personal power of the people running them. </p>

<p>That&#39;s because Hobbits, above all other races, lack the desire for power. Frodo especially, that&#39;s why he was able to resist the power of the ring relatively easily.</p>

<p>&quot;Found in a French museum with an inscribed attribution on the frame saying it was by Lewis Carroll and of Lorina Liddell, it shows an “uneasy” pubescent model in her teenage years.</p>

<p>Expert analysis shows it was taken around the time Carroll was seeing the Liddells, using the same processes he is known to have used in photography.</p>

<p>Comparison with other photographs of Lorina are said to show “certain similarities”, though the truth about the picture cannot be proved for certain more than a century after the author’s death.</p>

<p>Prof Hugh Haughton, one of the contributors to the programme, said the photograph – if it was taken by Carroll – was a “shocking image”, with the author’s relationship with the Liddell girls known to have a “huge intensity” which would be “pretty strange now”.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Aslan was like Jesus; basically.  ANyway, look up CS Lewis books The Screwtape Letters (about a lessor demons attempt to &quot;possess&quot; a man) and the book Mere Christianity. Amazing books.  The love of his life and he were finally married when they were both older, and they only got to spend a few short years together before she passed away from cancer.  He almost lost his faith from it and wrote about his sorrow,questioning his faith and God.  Its very raw, real and human and I love that he never gave up on God.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because it&#39;s not an allegory to Jesus. The only thing they have in common is their resurrection. Gandalf is the equivalent to an angel, more literally a servant of a specific God in the pantheon (Manwe).</p>

<p>The reason he was sent back was because Saruman failed in his task as the leader of the Wizards and became corrupted by the ring, so Gandalf took over his title of the white wizard because he was the only one to stay true to his cause.</p>

<p>I find it interesting that there are 5 towers: Cirith Until, Orthanac, Minas Tirith, Minas Morgul and Barad-Dur. I think it was always kind of up in the air which towers were &quot;The Two Towers&quot;- the movies assumed Orthanac (Saruman) and Barad-Dur (Sauron). </p>

Another theory I&#39;ve found says it might have been Cirith Ungol and Orthanac as both had people (Frodo in IV, Saruman in III) stranded at the top of them at the end of books 3 and 4 within the book.

    <div class="md"><p>Very interesting theory! I just want to add a point to the discussion: It was Peter Jackson who created the now - iconic visual of the Eye of Sauron on the top of Barad-dûr. I remember reading somewhere (I&#39;ll try and fish out the interview and post a source) that he needed something to be a physical representation of Sauron throughout the films. Before the trilogy, Barad-dûr was just a fortress. The &#39;eye&#39; was just in the minds of the various characters who became influenced by the ring. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, the physical eye of Sauron was simply a physical representation of Sauron. He didn&#39;t have a physical form at the time, but that doesn&#39;t translate well to a movie. (In my opinion, this was a brilliant way to represent it.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It seems like you haven&#39;t actually read LOTR.</p>

<p>First off, the Ring has much more power than just invisibility. If anyone wears it who knows how to use it, it would enable them to conquer the world. That&#39;s why they make Frodo carry it, because he can&#39;t unlock it&#39;s true potential.</p>

<p>Second, the island kingdom (Numenor) was not destroyed because they failed to kill Sauron. The armies of Numenor came to fight him, but Sauron surrendered after seeing their might. They take him prisoner to their island and over the years he convinces them to invade what is essentially heaven. So their island is destroyed by a divine reprisal. </p>

<p>Finally, if we&#39;re discussing LOTR symbolism, I think two very important subjects are the rings and the wizards, because they play a massive role in the story. The rings are powerful artifacts Sauron gave out to many races as gifts, but he tricked them and crafted the One Ring which acted as a sort of master control and bent them to his will.  The five wizards are basically angels (called Maiar) sent by God (called Manwe) to help the mortal races fight Sauron. Saruman is eventually corrupted by power and forms an alliance with Sauron, and only Gandalf fulfills his duty of battling Sauron head on. So what do you guys think those represent?</p>

<p>Radagast the Brown is only seen in the Hobbit films. He&#39;s the guy with the bunny sled and bird-shit on his face.</p>

<p>The two blue wizards are mentioned in the first Hobbit movie, in the rainy scene soon after the group leaves the Shire. Gandalf says to Bilbo that he forgets the two blue wizards names. This is a joke because Tolkien never came up with a definitive version of their names, and each revision of his works has new names for them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is awesome. I&#39;ve always thought there was a hidden message behind Tolkien&#39;s saga, and I have always tried to make parrallels with the real world.</p>

<p>I thought that the hobbits, elves, dwarves could be the goyim (with the LOTR races being the main religious groups in real life, or different ethnic groups, such as the caucasians, the Africans, the eastern Asians etc). The orcs would be you know who, the nazgul would be the zionists, mordor would be that small state in middle-east, isengard would be washington. Sauron would be the BIS. The ring would be international finance, or the power to print fiat currencies.</p>

<p><a href="https://s29.postimg.org/4wgmtpg47/picture.png">The Balrog in Moria could be Rockfeller</a>. They quite look alike, so that&#39;s an easy one. Unless it&#39;s his mate Soros.</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t figured where would be mount doom yet, and who Mr Fraudo is. Maybe he&#39;s not around yet.</p>

<p>I admit I&#39;m probably a little off here. And I don&#39;t know well enough about the details of the saga to make all the parrallels.</p>
