        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hey Guys</p>

<p>I wrote this for holofractal but believe you may enjoy it as well. Nassim Haramein has expanded on John Wheeler, Max Planck, Einsten, and Bucky Fuller to unify physics - simply and beautifully.</p>

<p>I am going to attempt show the major differences between our current standard model and the fractal holographic theory to my understanding. </p>

<p>Nassim seamlessly blends <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop_quantum_gravity">Loop Quantum Gravity</a>, String Theories <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holographic_principle">Holographic Principle</a>, and the math surrounding <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.6562">Planck Stars</a> - all in an intuitive, logical package - with zero hidden parameters or free variables. </p>

<p>There are two main aspects of this theory. The quantum vacuum geometry based on work in Synergetics from B Fuller, consisting of a infinite/fractal tetrahedral array &amp; what is known as the vector equilibrium (cubeoctahedron) - and an isotropic, omnidirectional lattice of overlapping/interwoven planck spheres (PSU) . I know thats a large word salad, but its honestly all very simple and intuitive.</p>

<p>Basically, imagine a 3d flower of life packing of spheres as the actual fluid-medium of space. The lines that run from the centers of the spheres to the other centers are the geometry that dictate interaction, i.e. a length between two spheres is one &#39;side&#39; of a tetrahedron. </p>

<p>The geometry governs the interaction of these spheres - they are two sides of the same coin. The geometry is essentially the force lines and equilibrium lines in this lattice.</p>

<p>These spheres are of the planck length diameter and planck mass energy/density, constants which lie at the basis of quantum theory - fundamental quantizations of the electromagnetic field. I will refer to these as PSUs (planck spherical units). The vacuum geometry allows for us to have a quantum vacuum that is full of energy but that is essentially at a ground state so that this energy is unperceived. When the vacuum becomes &#39;active&#39; - we see as particles/matter. </p>

<p>The problem with mainstream physics is that it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_energy">ignores this vacuum energy</a> (because nothing works when it is included). When you try and calculate how much energy of vacuum fluctuations would be in a cm<sup>3</sup> of space, you get 10<sup>93</sup> grams (planck density). This is absurdly high - so high, it has been called the worst prediction of physics - the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_catastrophe">vacuum catastrophe</a>. </p>

<p>This nearly infinite vacuum energy is renormalized in QFT, simply subtracting it from the equations to make them work. </p>

<p>What Nassim does is start with these PSUs as the basis for a space lattice (so that space is granular in woven loops, Loop Quantum Gravity) that stretches in all directions. No &#39;empty&#39; space - just unperceivable vacuum. </p>

<p>When he attempted to calculate how these quantized bits could give mass to the matter that we see around us, he unlocked or revealed a hidden property of the Universe, it is holographic.</p>

<p>If you add up the fluctuations that fit in a nucleon of an atom, in the proton, you get 10<sup>55</sup> grams. This is the mass of all protons - the mass of the observable Universe, dubbed the &#39;holographic gravitational mass.&#39; </p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/holofractal/comments/2uzqhe/eli5_holographic_mass_quantum_weirdness_rest_mass/">ELI5 - Holographic mass, planck wormhole lattice, quantum weirdness</a></p>

<p>If you apply the well-known but theoretical holographic principle to the proton (that is, the surface area of the proton can fully represent the volume information) by simply dividing the surface PSUs by volume PSUs and multiplying by 2 * the planck mass, you get the rest mass of the proton, 1.602×10<sup>-24</sup> grams. <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2+*+%284.7116551*10%5E40+*+planck+mass%29+%2F+1.2804*10%5E60">Here it is on wolfram alpha</a> You can apply these holographic equations to any black hole to go from it&#39;s volume-&gt;mass, or reversed. </p>

<p>A major piece of evidence for Nassim is the fact that if you start with the currently accepted standard proton mass and work the holographic equations backwards, you yield a proton charge radius that was just deduced via the most accurate proton charge radius experiment to date <a href="http://resonance.is/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Addendum-to-Quantum-Gravity-and-the-Holographic-Mass.pdf">source</a>. This charge radius is &#39;stumping&#39; the standard model, being some 4% off of predictions. </p>

<p>The reason why we only perceive the rest mass of the proton outside of it&#39;s surface is because of the holographic network - instantaneous information transfer of the majority of the protons massenergy through planck sized wormholes connecting each protons surface. The amount of PSUs in the volume (~10<sup>60)</sup> that don&#39;t have instant access to a surface PSU (to the holographic network) (10<sup>40)</sup> is (~10<sup>-20),</sup> which multiplied by 2* the planck mass just so happen to equal the rest mass of the proton. </p>

<td><strong>Space/Field</strong></td>
<td>Nassims theory utilizes a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superfluidity">superfluid</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superconductivity">superconducting</a> lattice of spherical PSU&#39;s stretching in all directions. An omnidirectional 3d flower of life lattice. This is an aether. Matter arises from this field through co-spinning PSU&#39;s, giving them relativistic mass compared to the surrounding field.  Each PSU is a tiny black hole. It&#39;s a self contained gravitational/electromagnetic packet first introduced by John Wheeler - a &#39;geon&#39;. The vacuum is full of energy, however the geometry of the vacuum allows equilibrium - the cube octahedron or vector equilibrium - which yields no force vectors in any direction at rest - it&#39;s a ground state.</td>
<td>The vacuum of space is empty, all matter was created instantly in a single moment. Quantum virtual particles can pop into and out of existence here. Note these quantum virtual particles can now be understood as plank spheres becoming coherent for a small amount of time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Mass</strong></td>
<td>Nassims theory shows that it is the spin of space that allows mass to arise. <a href="https://gfycat.com/RewardingDifferentBear">Crude visualization of a proton planck ball out of a planck lattice</a> Everything is a harmonic oscillator, that looks like a dual torus of implosion and expansion. Not a solid sphere, but a resulting sphere from <a href="http://vacuumsingularity.files.wordpress.com/2010/07/u4bubble.gif?w=450">this</a> Matter is space, spinning and curling. This dual torus results from an extremely basic change to Einstein&#39;s equations, adding in spin and torsion to the field equations by using a modified Kerr-Newman metric that can be read about in <a href="http://hiup.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/scalinglaw_paper.pdf">A Universal Scaling Law for Organized Matter</a>. This is where the generalized holographic solution equations come in. The proton&#39;s <strong>source of mass</strong> is because there are a higher amount of volume PSUs than surface PSUs, and the surface PSUs are terminations of planck schwarzchild wormholes (Einstein-Rosen bridge) to other protons  - leaving ~10<sup>-20</sup> of the volume PSUs to give mass that can be perceived outside the event horizon. <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/holofractal/comments/2mlyeu/depiction_of_the_holographic_mass/">See here for more</a> and <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/holofractal/comments/2rvuor/how_the_planck_instantaneous_wormholes_work_for/">here for more on holographic mass vs standard mass, and the wormhole network</a></td>
<td>Unknown. We think that the elusive higgs field brings mass to particles, but we have yet to nail it down.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Black holes</strong></td>
<td>Einstein&#39;s field equation solutions that were found, were solved with the Schwartzchild solution. This solution showed that everything in space was part of a singularity curve that would eventually coallesce into infinity. In Nassims theory, almost every self-sustained system is either a black hole or a virtual black hole. However, these black holes are not the traditional spacetime tunnel to a singularity, they are an implosion/explosion towards (due to a dual-torus dynamic that can be seen in the gif above) a single PSUs that is not spinning relative to the PSUs around it, a true vacuum. This makes them stable, and from outside the event horizon could be a star (the white hole or radiation outwards), or a proton.</td>
<td>Mainstream has no real explanation for the structure of black holes, we&#39;re waiting for quantum gravity. Hm.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Dark Energy &amp; Cosmological Constant</strong></td>
<td>In Nassims theory, dark energy is easily explained. &#39;Dark energy&#39; causes the expansion we see in the Universe. If you simply take a 10<sup>55g</sup> proton, and blow it up to the size of our Universe, you end up with the exact energy density of the cosmological constant (10<sup>-29</sup> g/cm<sup>3</sup> ). This implicates that perhaps our Universe started as a proton in a high density other Universe, and popped out, causing massive expansion due to the pressure difference.</td>
<td>Unknown. We place an X in our equations equivalent to the fluctuations we see previously. Starting to be linked to the vacuum fluctuations of space.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Gravity</strong></td>
<td>In Nassims theory, gravitation has been literally linked to geometry of space. The geometric collapse of the space (the isotropic vector matrix + jitterbugging) allows this toroidal flow inwards. <a href="https://gfycat.com/UntimelyThunderousIsabellinewheatear">GIF - geometric collapse</a></td>
<td>Unknown.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Strong Force/Quantum Gravity</strong></td>
<td>In Nassims theory, the strong force is simply another facet of gravitation at the quantum scale, due to the black hole proton. Nassim has incorporated torque, or spin, into Einsteins field equations. Simply put, the two forces of the gravitational attraction and the electrodynamic repulsion are balanced in a multi-proton system. E.g. two black hole protons &#39;orbiting&#39; are completely balanced. Further, nuclear emission rates are characteristic of the time it takes for one orbital of two entities, as is the strong force interaction period. This can be read about in the Schwarzchild Proton <a href="http://hiup.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/AIP_CP_SProton_Haramein.pdf">paper</a>. Even more compelling is the fact that the 10<sup>14</sup> gram relativistic mass would fall off exactly as the Yukawa potential of the strong nuclear force - yielding extremely close to the rest mass further than a single planck length away. Massive Black holes have already been <a href="http://www.space.com/24936-supermassive-black-hole-spin-quasar.html">shown to spin extremely close to the speed of light</a></td>
<td>Unknown. This is where most of Quantum Physics and decades of work on unsolved Quantum Chromodynamics arises from, attempting to explain how such energetic particles like protons could stick together. So again - we came up with a force, mediated by &#39;gluons&#39; with the exact force to satisfy this.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Entanglement</strong></td>
<td>The vacuum of space is a superfluid, superconducting light lattice. This allows instant harmonic communication between all particles - via Schwarzchild Wormholes, a wheeler wormhole network. Since all protons are connected through Einstein-Rosen bridges, we can literally think of all protons as touching. Entanglement is a shadow of this holographic network. The premise that entanglement is cause by wormholes is an old one that&#39;s recently gotten more attention, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ER%3DEPR">EP=EPR</a>.</td>
<td>Unkown - spooky action at a distance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Light</strong></td>
<td>Because there is already an isotropic PSU lattice of self contained gravitational/em packet <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geon_%28physics%29">geons</a> stretching in all directions, light is an excitation of this field.  This explains where the limit of the speed of light comes from, as well as why light doesn&#39;t have to &#39;speed up&#39; to C. Light is not moving through vacuum, light is vacuum fluctuating. This explains the particle/wave duality - and allows for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilot_wave">Pilot Wave</a> interpretation of QM. This also explains why when you cool something to 0k, it becomes superconducting. This is because the lattice is already superconducting and superfluid. If you resonate with this planck lattice correctly, you get macro-quantum effects. You get to access the Schwarzchild wormhole network connecting all protons and other quantum phenomenon.</td>
<td>Although we have the famous equation e=mc<sup>2,</sup> these terms are almost meaningless. We don&#39;t know why C is C, and both mass and energy are undefined terms. Nassim derives all of these in his equations naturally, which can be seen <a href="http://imgur.com/a/z2Nz4">here</a></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Sacred Geometry/Phi Fibonacci/Flower of Life</strong></td>
<td>This is called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometrodynamics">geometrodynamics</a> the attempt to describe all physical phenomenon in terms of geometry. The PSUs are packed in a 3d flower of life, which is the holographic interference pattern of the universe. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGGvwkrDZNA">first fractal iteration of the vacuum geometry lattice is a 64 tetrahedron matrix, in which the flower of life and metatrons cube can be extracted.</a>. The sphere packing is called omni-triangulated geodesic spheres by Bucky Fuller. The platonic solids and molecular bonding angles are most likely due to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZPtBwMLwAI">12 points of tension that arise in the proton.</a> Here is a depiction of the 64 TH M, with sphere packing, and the famous <a href="http://i.ytimg.com/vi/B7v7s1weUW8/maxresdefault.jpg">temple of Osiris flower of life</a> is an <a href="http://vacuumsingularity.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/holo-flower-2.jpg?w=425&amp;h=398">exact match</a>.

<td>Bunk, silly woo.  Pattern recognition</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Consciousness</strong></td>
<td>This is getting into speculation, but this planck lattice makes up everything, and it is a hyper-instantaneous-information network that is in feedback and feedforward loop with itself due to the dual torus. It is most likely that consciousness arises from the feedback-feedforward loop from the quantum vacuum&lt;--&gt;physical reality.</td>
<td>A magical property of the brain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Life</strong></td>
<td>Since the universe contains a holographic storage medium, the Universe now has a mechanism to preserve novelty/complexification, or what can be called syntropy/negentropy. The current state of the Universe&#39;s information is available in all matter. It is much like biological evolution, but across time and space for all matter. What is more prevalent has more &#39;resonance&#39; in the holographic mass.

The Standard Model, however, relies on the fewest number of assumptions to describe the world around us, though. But &quot;Wavefunction collapse&quot; is pretty laughable - I don&#39;t think the real phenomenon wavefunction collapse was intended to describe, in any way resembles wavefunction collapse. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just like General Relativity faced countless criticisms before gravitational lensing could be observed, this theory will face significant opposition until it predicts demonstrable physical phenomena - as compelling as it is, a valid hypothesis has yet to be produced. Not on board with the ARK crystals until a peer reviewed study is complete (please link one if I&#39;m not up to date). Mainstream science certainly has its flaws, but the scientific method cannot be understated. </p>

This is absurdly high - so high, it has been called the worst prediction of physics - the vacuum catastrophe.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not completely sold on this account of vacuum energy in physics. 
Even very recently there was a paper published suggesting that the the argument leading to the worst prediction in physics is not accurate and that the gravitational effect of colossally huge vacuum energy is not also huge:</p>

<p><a href="https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.95.103504">https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.95.103504</a></p>

<p>It remains to be seen where that line of research goes from here but I think it is fair to say that the gravitational effect of vacuum energy is an open problem, to the extent where it&#39;s not clear whether it&#39;s a problem of physics or difficulty of calculation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The paper puts forth what Nassim has been saying for years (and it also uses the huge vacuum energy value) - namely, that harmonic oscillators / vacuum fluctuations are both expanding and contracting in phase.</p>

<p>Also, the vacuum energy comes out of the most basic tenents of Quantum Field Theory.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Quantum field theory states that all fundamental fields, such as the electromagnetic field, must be quantized at each and every point in space[citation needed]. A field in physics may be envisioned as if space were filled with interconnected vibrating balls and springs, and the strength of the field were like the displacement of a ball from its rest position. The second quantization of quantum field theory requires that each such ball-spring combination be quantized, that is, that the strength of the field be quantized at each point in space. Canonically, if the field at each point in space is a simple harmonic oscillator, its quantization places a quantum harmonic oscillator at each point. </p>

<p>The quantization of a simple harmonic oscillator requires the lowest possible energy, or zero-point energy of such an oscillator to be:</p>

<p>Summing over all possible oscillators at all points in space gives an infinite quantity.</p>
