<p>Yeah except that&#39;s not what you did at all. You gave &quot;constructive criticism&quot; saying the OP should post a summary of the videos and asked which one is relevant.</p>

<p>When someone responded and gave you the information, you linked to a mocking image about the information.</p>

<p>Sorry that you think concern trolling (&#39;constructive criticism,&#39; lol) and then mocking a sincere response is the same thing as &quot;asking about details.&quot;</p>

<p>You linked to an image, mocking the connections made. You offered zero rebuttal, and instead just dismissed it. Which, again, is something you do often on this sub.</p>

<p>At least own what you do instead of pretending you&#39;re just some truth-seeker. The gap between what you claim you&#39;re doing and what people can plainly see you doing is huge.</p>

<p>What, specifically, do you find so mock-worthy about the information provided here. If you&#39;re going to demand a level of sophistication from other people, you could at least make the effort yourself instead of just dismissals and mockery.</p>

<p>How about someone provide some actual proof that Seth Rich was killed by the DNC. </p>

<p>Did anybody every provide proof of Pizzagate to Hillary Clinton or Podesta? Nope. Just a bunch of random youtube, 4chan, voat posts attempting too.</p>

<p>Same thing with this Seth Rich fiasco. I&#39;m not the one who has to demand a level of sophistication because as I said, I remain skeptical about the whole thing. Until someone shows me something otherwise which could change my opinion. </p>

<p>I agree that Seth Rich was murdered. I agree the Awan brothers are real and had access to Democratic computers. I&#39;m not dismissing individual facts. I am simply not agreeing with and remain skeptical of the theory that the DNC had Rich killed. </p>

<p>How about you refute the claims in the video you watched? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Tell me how Alpha Jollah set up the murder? The guy in the video just says &quot;Alpha Jollah is the one who set up the murder of Seth Rich&quot;</p>

<p>He then goes on to say that Pakistani&#39;s set up Jollah. </p>

<p>How is he coming to these conclusions?</p>

<p>Where is the proof that Jollah hired two MS-13 guys?</p>

<p>He says &quot;again, I&#39;ve got lots of foot-prints&quot; (connections) But he doesn&#39;t list any.</p>

<p>Then he goes on the say that Jollah is Boko-haram or Al-Qaeda. </p>

<p>he doesn&#39;t even know anything about this guy. He didn&#39;t even know which one Jollah was in the picture (as he admits).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well that&#39;s a pretty disingenuous summary of the video. </p>

<p>This is exactly why I don&#39;t understand you being a mod of this sub. It&#39;s a conspiracy sub. By its very nature there are often times when assumptions must be made based on the best information available.</p>

<p>Webb doesn&#39;t have me fully convinced, but he&#39;s provided a long chain of information and analysis leading up to this. You&#39;re free to disagree with it, but watching one video and then saying <em>wow he doesn&#39;t have definitive proof of the conspiracy this is so ridiculous!</em> really misses the point of this sub.</p>

<p>Again, feel free to disagree with particular connections he made, but the lack of definitive proof is why the story is in <strong>this</strong> sub and not on a news sub at the moment.</p>

<p>Which is what motivated my original question. If you think that a lack of total proof is grounds for mocking users and different conspiracy theories, why do you want to be a mod on this sub?</p>

<p>This argument within the video has 0 factual information and going back to my original point of even commenting in here, the submission had 0 context to go along with this post/video. </p>

<p>This type of b.s. is exactly why I asked my question in the first place. If you need to reframe everything I say in order to &quot;refute&quot; it, why bother?</p>

<p>This sub exists for issues in this world that do not have definitive proof (for a whole host of reasons). </p>

Out of all the crazy things posted here, a mod here trying to call this post fake is suspicious. And by nature of this sub, it&#39;s smart for us to be suspicious of our mods. He is entitled to be skeptical of your post, but he is not immune to us being skeptical of his intentions. I would think a mod of a sub like this would encourage users to be skeptical of any mod who posts polarizing opinions. It&#39;s only fair for that to go both ways.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Skepticism is quite simply &quot;doubt&quot; and consists of refusing to make-up your mind or to commit one way or the other until more is known and quite possibly not even then because the actual answer may in fact lay somewhere else altogether which is another possibility that any skeptic worth being called one always takes into consideration. </p>

<p>&quot;Disbelief&quot;, however, isn&#39;t. It is an obvious commitment to a contradictory position because that is &quot;believed&quot; in the same sense and manner as what it opposes is, instead.</p>

<p>If you were an honest skeptic you could accept and admit that what&#39;s under discussion is within the realm of possibility but unlikely from your perspective without more definitive proof. </p>

<p>You do not need to dismiss or discount it, and if you were actually as skeptical as you claim, you wouldn&#39;t, but rather await any further and more convincing developments.</p>

<p>I&#39;d agree and I wish that&#39;s what was happening. Instead, there&#39;s a tendency for &quot;skeptics&quot; to just summarily dismiss and mock the claims and then demand absolute proof of the claims when pushed back.</p>

<p>Which is a standard that, by the very nature of this sub, is almost always impossible.</p>

<p>Case in point is what I responded to here, when a user asked for context, it was provided, and then they linked to a mocking image in response.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Back when he was running for president in 2008, Barack Obama insisted that medical marijuana was an issue best left to state and local governments. <strong>&quot;I&#39;m not going to be using Justice Department resources to try to circumvent state laws on this issue,&quot; he vowed</strong>, promising an end to the Bush administration&#39;s high-profile raids on providers of medical pot, which is legal in 16 states and the District of Columbia.</p>

<p>But over the past year, the Obama administration has quietly unleashed a multi­agency crackdown on medical cannabis that goes far beyond anything undertaken by George W. Bush. The feds are busting growers who operate in full compliance with state laws, vowing to seize the property of anyone who dares to even rent to legal pot dispensaries, and threatening to imprison state employees responsible for regulating medical marijuana. With more than 100 raids on pot dispensaries during his first three years, Obama is now on pace to exceed Bush&#39;s record for medical-marijuana busts. &quot;There&#39;s no question that Obama&#39;s the worst president on medical marijuana,&quot; says Rob Kampia, executive director of the Marijuana Policy Project. &quot;He&#39;s gone from first to worst.&quot;</p>

<p>Obama had countless opportunities to do something about cannabis, yet it&#39;s still a schedule 1 drug. Even hemp is still illegal to grow (WTF?). And the USA still leads all other nations in prison population. Obama is either really fucking stupid, incompetent, or he actually <em>wants</em> Americans to rot their lives away in prison.</p>

<p>Yes.  Congress has still not changed its classification.</p>

<p>The DEA did raids while he was president. Those raids dropped off in his second term.</p>

<p>It varies from state to state, but since 2014 in some locations and for certain purposes, yes.</p>

<p>Yes, it should be banned because the title is misleading. There is precisely zero evidence or proof in those videos. Just some rambling about used cars and CIA connection without any evidence. This is blatantly using Seth&#39;s death to promote his right-wing agenda.</p>

<p>George Web is sick. He doesn&#39;t care about Seth or the wishes of the people that actually knew him best, his parents. pleaded with us to stop using their son&#39;s death for political gain? If you cared about him, you wouldn&#39;t piss all over his body and parade it around the Internet to make your team look better. How shameful.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is masterful disinfo.  He moves so quickly and makes enormous leaps, but he&#39;s dropping so many names and dates you get lured into thinking that it&#39;s proof.</p>

<p>He says that his evidence that it&#39;s this guy is that Russian Intelligence was warning authorities about Jahlah. He then makes the (somewhat logical) connection that because he was released directly after being busted for the car theft ring in november- he must be an FBI informant.  I have no idea where he came up with an MS13 AQ connection for this guy, or where he came up with KimDotcom being an FBI informant who ratted out Rich to the FBI.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t tell if this guy is schizophrenic or doing professional disinfo.  He makes a few good connections and calls attention to interesting characters (there&#39;s evidence that there are politically affiliated characters illegally exporting luxury vehicles, laundering campaign finance funds, and probably financing terror), but then he very quickly draws huge conclusions that are based on loosely connected bits of information.  It really prays on beliefs and the schizophrenic nature of a lot of conspiracy theorists.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well said.</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s important to question the narrative. Trumps right wing propaganda narrative is so painfully obvious. Find a point to attack so you&#39;re not defending when the whole IC is saying &quot;yeah he&#39;s fucked.&quot;</p>

<p>I do not understand why the only narrative that&#39;s not ok to question is Trumps to his supporters. They are questioning WaPo, neocons,  NYT,  neo cons, dems,  liberals,  even fox news at times... But never the one fed you them by the Trump propaganda machine.</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s Bush&#39;s no child left behind bullshit,  forcing memorization for tests over critical thinking. They <em>need</em> to be told how to think. I think they really do want a dictator. Makes it easier to know how to feel as they lack that skill set</p>

<p>Rote memorization has always been part of that misguided approach to education.  If you haven&#39;t looked into it, check out the Skull and Bones Society&#39;s role in education as documented by Charlotte Iserbyt (senior policy advisor on education under the reagan administration) and Antony C Sutton (Hoover institution Economics Scholar).  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDyDtYy2I0M">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDyDtYy2I0M</a></p>

<p>I&#39;ve noticed this recently, too. People are so overwhelmed with (dis) information that is too difficult to parse and is constantly being refuted, that it&#39;s become necessary to people to just stand strong on their beliefs and it&#39;s driving emotions. I suspect that it&#39;s just an aspect of tribalism and mass- psychology that&#39;s being used against us.</p>

<p>It&#39;s certainly been exploited by the group leading the &quot;deplorables&quot;, who on reddit used the same meme and circlejerk strategies that we&#39;ve seen successfully employed by other social activist identity groups on here.  But remember that what you are seeing there is a vocal minority which is deliberately taking up more space than they represent, to appear much larger than they are.</p>

<p>&quot;4d chess&quot;.  The Trump supporters see him as combatting the enemy, so they aren&#39;t worried about vetting the validity of his propaganda.  I think the core supporters you&#39;re seeing are &quot;reactive&quot; in that they&#39;re goaded into reacting AGAINST what they see as an existential threat.  </p>

<p>That&#39;s happening on &quot;both sides&quot; of the political dichotomy right now, though it&#39;s traditionally been a term reserved for &quot;conservatives&quot;.  I&#39;m seeing the dualistic bating being pushed very hard by the media right now and the divide is growing more and more between what the two sides believe.  Belief no longer just refers to values, but to FACTS and what is objectively true.  Pick a side or rot.  That&#39;s the postmodernist political sphere we&#39;re currently dwelling in.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>a lot of people say that conspiracy theorists are just trying to make sense of a complicated world.  we see patterns that aren&#39;t there (apophenia) because it would be too scary to realize that the world is just chaos.</p>

<p>that&#39;s true to an extent- it&#39;s human nature to categorize systems.  but patterns are real.  we all draw different determinations from those patterns.  Most of us think the JFK assassination was a conspiracy.  Some of us are very specific about the details of that conspiracy.  Some of us probably think it was moonbeavers who killed kennedy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i didn&#39;t realize that watching youtube videos took &quot;effort&quot;...</p>

<p>but i watched enough of his early eric braverman videos in consecutive order to be absolutely confident that this is either disinformation or he is mentally ill.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s one of his early visualization videos which is clearly marketed to paranoid schizophrenics (&quot;targeted individuals&quot; who believe they are being &quot;gangstalked&quot; by government agents).  It uses all the right buzzwords, but is extremely convoluted while trying to appear linear and logical- <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gUtyL0OW5GM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gUtyL0OW5GM</a>.  </p>

<p>If I had schizophrenia, I suspect this would all be very convincing.  His method of pointing to what are basically word clouds while verbalizing loose connections and very high level conclusions is a very effective technique for convincing people of associations based on feeling.  It FEELS similar to someone like corbet, whose analytical technique is more rational and linear, but borrows from the more scattershot approach that alex jones takes.  But alex jones is making the connections ad hoc and has this very big concept of &quot;they&quot;, whereas webb is making planned presentations with a very unique format and associating very specific groups and individuals, which is a bit unsettling.</p>

<p>It seems that Webb has proved that the Awan brothers were running car dealerships in the US.

I&#39;m assuming they wouldn&#39;t want some random staffer driving around in a stolen car.</p>

<p>Am I lost because I haven&#39;t watched all of Webb&#39;s other videos?</p>

<p>Also, in his latest video (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWt84hwNZMQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWt84hwNZMQ</a>) he mentions Michael Posillico getting ISI (Awan brothers) into the United States, which is also what <a href="/u/moderndaytj">/u/moderndaytj</a> said a few days ago.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, ignoring that Blackwater was founded and named &quot;Blackwater&quot; in 1997 and that they are a private company with no reason to hide such a thing anyways (they could have called themselves Oil Warriors if they wanted), I can see those guys being coy enough to name themselves after what could earn them more money.  Regardless, I can&#39;t see any logical reason any espionage group would so blatantly out themselves that civilians on the internet could look at the name of the company and see CIA in it.  The excuse of needing to let other groups know who they are does not make sense to me.  </p>

<p>If that was actually the case, that they would need to let other groups know who they were and what they were doing, they would use actual freaking code that only these agencies know, and any time one agency has a suspicion that a company is acting weird they would run their code and see it is the CIA doing something and they&#39;d move on.  </p>

<p>What I suspect actually happens is one agency might see something suspicious and then they will go and, you know, ask the other agencies if they have any resources there.  The reason I believe this to be the case is because putting CIA or whatever in their name means whatever other agency has to notice that to leave them alone.  So if the other agency doesn&#39;t notice for whatever reason they are fucked.  It just seems like such a weird and inefficient, possibly even dangerous, way of letting another agency know you are there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a really great and valid question.</p>

<p>In order to recognize the pattern you need to do a lot of research before it starts to click. But, I think I can break it down for you.</p>

<p>Teenagers drawing pentagrams on things, rebelling against whatever... it happens all over the place. Consider this at one end of the spectrum of effort.</p>

<p>What you have to stop and think about are when adults are making intentional Satanic connections and patterns systematically and going through a lot of effort to do it. (I use Satanic loosely, btw, you can alternatively use &quot;occult&quot; but that doesn&#39;t capture the menace behind it).</p>

<p>For example Odin and Baphomet are very intentionally painted the same way.</p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/eKSG6HL.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/eKSG6HL.jpg</a></p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/BHfVrz2.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/BHfVrz2.jpg</a></p>

<p>Another example where people went to a lot of trouble is the Bohemian Grove owl.</p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/5ncLCPl.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/5ncLCPl.jpg</a></p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/esDIY11.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/esDIY11.jpg</a></p>

<p>Epstein went to a lot of trouble to recreate the owl.</p>

<p><a href="https://aamichael666.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/6-jeffrey-epstein-orgy-island-temple-and-owl.jpg?w=330&amp;amp;h=202">https://aamichael666.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/6-jeffrey-epstein-orgy-island-temple-and-owl.jpg?w=330&amp;amp;h=202</a></p>

<p>It seems a clear reference that could go all the way back to Horus. And this is where people get stopped up. We can all go to the Luxor and get Ancient Egyptian looking crap. It seems unbelievable to most people that a cult going all the way back is secretly controlling the world.</p>

<p>There is more to it, than that. Again, watch the effort of adults who systematically project patterns of Satanic references.</p>

<p>It is a form of wordless communication and signaling to other similarly aligned groups.</p>

<p>I am confident there is evidence to suggest a way to express this problem is to think of the people in charge as &quot;The Infiltrators.&quot;</p>

<p>War is theater. Politics is theater. Power is exchanged through infiltration and the figureheads merely pawns for those who, at any given time and place, are the best at infiltrating. This is a very simple concept for people and it has been employed throughout history.</p>

<p>I am asking you to believe that the the Infiltrators have infiltrated other infiltrators, who all have a history of believing in &quot;secret knowledge&quot; that they can employ to control others.</p>

<p>This is why most people dismiss what is going on. You actually have to take some time to get your head around it. It takes cognitive effort because the logical conclusion of infiltrating behavior is that there are multiple groups who have created multiple groups for the specific purpose of infiltrating political organizations, religions... any group with the ability to move people to action.</p>

<p>The Infiltrators go way back, but the Infiltration Movement that concerns everyone right now began with the Wednesday Psychology Group and Sigmund Freud.</p>

<p>Have a quick peak at some of this evidence that I am presenting you. Suspend your judgment for a minute and pretend like a teacher in a university class. Because this is a history lesson that is out in the open, is easily traced and merely employs textbook psychological principles to control the masses.</p>

<p>I&#39;m going to start with a study by the Tavistock Institute of Human Relations in cooperation with the US Air Force.</p>

<p>&quot;Some principles of mass persuasion: selected findings of research on the sale of United States war bonds.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12336576">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12336576</a></p>

<p>Since the creation of Tavistock, they have been studying how to better mass persuade people. They work with our government and many other governments. On their own site, they call it &quot;change consultancy&quot; and reorganize police departments, hospitals and schools. It is an international effort.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.tavinstitute.org/projects/change-consultancy-tavistock-we-have-a-problem/">http://www.tavinstitute.org/projects/change-consultancy-tavistock-we-have-a-problem/</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>…. help us to raise the level of strategic leadership competence among our second tier senior leaders, so that they can step up and take the business/organisation to it’s next level of development in the next 5-7 years. We have surveyed the talent of the 2nd tier, and as the executive board, we have found them to be highly skilled operationally but deficient in strategic thinking.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, I don&#39;t want you to get too tied up with just Tavistock. They aren&#39;t the only game in town. They are just the best example to work with, since they&#39;ve been around so long.</p>

<p>Tavistock studied Social Dreaming. </p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_dreaming">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_dreaming</a></p>

<p>Learning to host a social dreaming matrix...</p>

<p><a href="http://www.tavinstitute.org/projects/learning-to-host-a-social-dreaming-matrix/">http://www.tavinstitute.org/projects/learning-to-host-a-social-dreaming-matrix/</a></p>

<p>So, what has happened here is that Tavistock has taken a religious experience and gone on to replicate it in a slightly different context. Joseph Smith, founder of the Mormon Church, utilized social dreaming to get his followers to &quot;see&quot; angels and golden plates in their &quot;mind&#39;s eye.&quot; (I won&#39;t get into his ties to the Masons, but the symbology is also found in early LDS church history.</p>

<p>Tavistock took all these religious movements and attempted to replicate the profound religious experiences in different contexts. They created the Children of God cult, which used &quot;free love&quot; and young boys and girls to &quot;flirt to convert,&quot; essentially. River Phoenix came from this cult.</p>

<p>They also created the &quot;Process Church of the Final Judgment&quot; who infiltrated Scientology and co-opted the Manson cult after his arrest.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t find it lickity split, but you can see Manson becomes careful with his words and even says he doesn&#39;t want to offend, &quot;the Masons or other groups.&quot; He was talking about the Process Church.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5QR14hIdjc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5QR14hIdjc</a></p>

<p>Cults are the best at mind control. Heaven&#39;s Gate proves that cult members will go so far as to kill themselves.</p>

<p>So, beyond the &quot;Mass Persuasion&quot; using &quot;Media Assets&quot; you have people on the ground being controlled by cults where The Infiltrators are calling the shots, unbeknownst to cult members.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060508185756/http://mtracy9.tripod.com/cia_instructions.htm">https://web.archive.org/web/20060508185756/http://mtracy9.tripod.com/cia_instructions.htm</a></p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Mockingbird">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Mockingbird</a></p>

<p>So, the Infiltrators are in control of your political groups, your religions, your tv, your radio and your government. Again, Elections are just theater. War is just theater.</p>

<p>You have entities like the Air Force doing studies upon the people, the economy and these secret actors are, likely, infiltrated and have massive secret powers.</p>

<p>They are conducted unethical human experimentation.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unethical_human_experimentation_in_the_United_States">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unethical_human_experimentation_in_the_United_States</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Several significant operational techniques were developed in this theater, including extensive research into sexual blackmail, surveillance technology, and the possible use of mind-altering drugs in field operations.</p>

<p>Several of the children who Cameron experimented on were sexually abused, in at least one case by several men. One of the children was filmed numerous times performing sexual acts with high-ranking federal government officials, in a scheme set up by Cameron and other MKULTRA researchers, to blackmail the officials to ensure further funding for the experiments.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, you see, there are techniques that have been studied and have been employed and are being employed to gain complete control over people and populations.</p>

<p>On the &quot;scientific&quot; front, they call it &quot;systems psychodynamics.&quot; It is based on Wilfred Bion&#39;s &quot;basic assumption&quot; theories. In short, whenever the news is messing with or confirming your basic assumptions, it is a tool of policy change or a tool of maintaining the status quo.</p>

<p>You are being sold &quot;authoritarianism&quot; at every level. From the news you watch and read, to the games you play, to the music you listen to.</p>

<p>Beyond &quot;systems psychodynamics&quot; at work, the occult practices... the secret knowledge... has also been employed against the populace and we know because of MK Ultra.</p>

<p>The scary part about all of this is that black magic, while it doesn&#39;t work the way you were raised to believe, it does, in fact work.</p>

<p>People who believe in black magic do bad things. That is a real world consequence. Even people who dabble in it, who just want to check it out, have to do bad things to get involved.</p>

<p>So, these secret occult practices were studied and employed in the infiltration game. Like with scopolamine. This substance basically robs you of free will and can prevent you from remembering the things you did while under &quot;mind control.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2143584/Scopolamine-Powerful-drug-growing-forests-Colombia-ELIMINATES-free-will.html">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2143584/Scopolamine-Powerful-drug-growing-forests-Colombia-ELIMINATES-free-will.html</a></p>

<p>You can buy it on Alibaba.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.alibaba.com/showroom/scopolamine-powder.html">https://www.alibaba.com/showroom/scopolamine-powder.html</a></p>

<p>People empty out their ATMs or participate in their own rape, then can&#39;t remember anything. If used right. If used wrong, it will kill you. </p>

<p>Remember the story of Socrates? Perhaps it has been secret knowledge since that story was written that scopolamine kills the voice of reason and it has been an apt metaphor reminder to history that people&#39;s free will are actively being robbed by those in charge.</p>

<p>It gets worse, though.</p>

<p>Secret powders, double speak, secret symbols... systems psychodynamics... they work and you are falling for it because they are employing concrete psychological principles or scientific principles to work on your mind. Black magic does work. It just isn&#39;t magic. It is breaking the law and ethical boundaries and controlling the minds of as many people as possible to make them slaves.</p>

<p>The Infiltrators know this and the more &quot;Black Magic&quot; gets normalized, the more effect it can operate right under everyone&#39;s nose.</p>

<p>With voluminous evidence, it is clear the CIA has been participating in the drug trade at the highest levels. Meanwhile, the movies and news are showing you that violent cartel members are in charge. The cartels are pawns. But, putting it in your face and showing you that it ends at an Escobar or an El Chapo, means people will ignore the CIA&#39;s involvement because &quot;they aren&#39;t the real bad guys.&quot; (They are.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, before I get back to my day to day, I&#39;ll tell you what it all, potentially, adds up to. (I ran out of text in the first post.) This second post involves some conjecture, but I feel I have come across real worlds examples of what I am presenting. It is what the patterns and symbols &quot;all over the place&quot; are putting out there, I believe.</p>

<p>One occult religious practice was torture. Ritualized abuse. I suspect Tavistock participated based on their archivists &quot;War Time Studies&quot; comments and have seen writing indicating that Goebbels also experimented in torture/trauma based mind control... meaning Operation Paperclip scientists were likely aware.</p>

<p>You take a child, you treat them kind during the day, but at night you wake them up and torture them with masks on in every conceivable way. Under the pretext of &quot;witches&quot; or &quot;alien abductions&quot; or what have you, the victim is already immediately going to look crazy. So, whether the practitioners believe in it or not, the ritual aspect works specifically to compromise the victim&#39;s credibility.</p>

<p>It is worse than that, though. A side effect of this is multiple personality disorder, or dissociative personality disorder. Prolonged abuse and the most horrific abuse splits a person&#39;s personality into many parts, where one doesn&#39;t remember what happens to the other. It&#39;s a defense mechanism. An established psychological principal that human stumbled on long before the could comprehend the field of psychology.</p>

<p>That&#39;s what makes it so crazy sounding. But, when asked, Charles Manson gives you the answer to the real secret. The Many Faced God.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2oZWpqtNi4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2oZWpqtNi4</a></p>

<p>The Many Faced God/Moloch (The Great King)/Baphomet is the personification of this psychological defense mechanism people have and it sometimes results in an eidetic memory.</p>

<p>While most people become broken and useless after persistent torture, a few can stop operate out in the world, revolving back and forth between personalities, where one may not know what the others are doing.</p>

<p>The occult patterns are a reference to this, but they morph and take on so many forms. </p>

<p>One answer to the original question is we see this because this practice is old and it is a practice of infiltration and co-opting religions.</p>

<p>Nothing new, the Pharoahs allowed their people to have their gods, too. But the Pharoah reigned supreme.</p>

<p>The people who have infiltrated religions preserve the religion merely as preserving another face of Moloch.</p>

<p>The Process Church is a good example.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Process_Church_of_The_Final_Judgment">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Process_Church_of_The_Final_Judgment</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Process believes that, to varying degrees, these &quot;God-patterns&quot; exist within everyone. The main doctrine of The Process is the unity of Christ and Satan, who exist as opposites. Jehovah and Lucifer exist as opposites and when Christ and Satan are united, this will unite Jehovah and Lucifer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>MK Ultra is exactly experimentation into all of this and everything &quot;mass persuasion&quot; and &quot;mind control.&quot;</p>

<p>The goal is for a more &quot;suggestible&quot; population every day, with several layers of controlled opposition over the &quot;umbrella&quot; of ideas presented by mainstream media and pushed on the Internet.</p>

<p>Chemicals. Black Magic. Psychology.</p>

<p>It is all being used and the population allows it because of a variety of ideas and influences that combine together.</p>

<p>Moloch/Manchurian/Many Faced candidates that make it through make perfect politicians who may not even know they, themselves, secretly worship Moloch. It is controlled MPD/Dissociative Disorder.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, people like Aldous Huxley put forth &quot;Brave New World&quot; where happy slaves are achieved through chemicals... &quot;Soma&quot; Prozac. His ideas were inspired by the Opium War, if I recall.</p>

<p>Orwell&#39;s notion is to spread slavery through technology and surveillance. Increasing the influence of a few upon the many.</p>

<p>The truth combines all of these things and that is why is it right in everyone&#39;s faces.</p>

<p>None of this is new. We&#39;ve had Crusades and Inquisitions and Holocausts.</p>

<p>Still, these ideas are advancing in understanding and technique everyday and the world is not keeping up, in a lot of ways.</p>

<p>Still, there is always potential for change.</p>

<p>The problem we have right now is simple, and it exists whether you agree with what I posit about the Many Faced God.</p>

<p>Government transparency. Everything should be reviewable after a number of years, so that we can go back and see what happened and fix it. 25 years. 50 years. Whatever. As a population, the people can only make good decisions for themselves if they are informed.</p>

<p>If everyone stopped arguing and focused on this one issue, it would create a long term solution for the entire world.</p>

<p>As it stands now, the Infiltrators are organized crime and they have infiltrated every large group of people you identify with in order to further divisiveness and evade any kind of accountability.</p>

<p>Controlled opposition may sometimes tell the truth. Controlled opposition may seemingly agree with you, but anyone promoting war and slavery are promoting economic agendas and are actively working against the benefit of the People.</p>

<p>Ultimately, it would be great if I were wrong. But organized child abuse happens and politicians participate and nobody is doing anything about it. Nobody. No matter how fever pitch the debate reaches, we have never seen anyone of any real influence jailed for corruption. Only small fish.</p>

<p>It is proven that the establishment has covered up child abuse, that it is an international problem and the reason it exists is far worse than people just getting their rocks off. The reason it is exists is because it serves a political and economic purpose where programs have been employed to employ &quot;mind control&quot; and &quot;mass persuasion.&quot;</p>

<p>Either way, we have to take a stand against Infiltrators and transparency of government is the only way to expose them.</p>

<p>Their own theology promotes volition and transcending unto free will, being capable of anything and achieving great power. Their beliefs are crap.</p>

<p>Infiltrating is a chickenshit way of taking power and these chickenshits need to be exposed and held accountable.</p>

<p>It isn&#39;t powerful. It is cowardly. It is Unconstitutional. It doesn&#39;t belong in our country and we would do well to drive it from the world.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would just like to note that as someone who has watched and read up on SRA and MKULTRA for the last 15 years, I have come to the conclusion that it is for the most part BS. Yes MKULTRA existed, and no there is no great evidence that it was involved with SRA or trauma based mind control. The same sources are always cited and debunked.</p>

<p>Regarding the &quot;Infiltrators&quot;, and the &quot;occult&quot;. I&#39;ve also looked into this for a really long time and come to the conclusion that it&#39;s a gross oversimplification of geo-politics, economics, and religion. </p>

<p>I just want to offer this contrary opinion and suggest people research it for themselves while keeping in mind what a primary, and secondary source is, while also understanding how to properly separate the truth from the noise. No I&#39;m not a paid shill or whatever it is being called at the moment. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bishop Pace, of the LDS church, interviewed children every week for a year and a half across multiple states. How do you explain they all have the same stories? How do you explain the Dutroux Affair? The Finders Case? The evidence list in the Norwegian politicians scandal?</p>

<p>SRA does not have to be widespread. It could just be another infiltrated group that requires extra secrecy.</p>

<p>There are plenty of run of the mill pedophiles who operate in the same circuit, using the same networks. We know child torture happens. We know ritual abuse happens. It is in video in every part of the world.</p>

<p>There are also cannibals. Ever visit zambianmeat.com?</p>

<p>These small groups certainly exist and these things certainly exist in human nature and human history.</p>

<p>With the greatest potential for creating infiltration ever, it seems naive to think that most organizations aren&#39;t infiltrated once they reach a certain level of influence.</p>

<p>Operation Mockingbird is a great example. CIA Instructions to Media Assets are a great example. The Media just makes more groups to be infiltrated.</p>

<p>Occult groups would, likely then also be infiltrated.</p>

<p>Espionage goes back as far as the beginning of human civilization, at least. </p>

<p>There is no reason to believe that the Infiltrators are in control, that they utilize the Tavistock researched &quot;Matrix of Power&quot; strategy, where they overcome hierarchical structures by planting people in a matrix across the organization and there is more to cults than black magic.</p>

<p>It is just a sliver of espionage an infiltration as a whole.</p>

<p>By and large, the protected political pedophilia, like in the Pentagon case, demonstrates clearly that there is a matrix in place that is specifically designed to protect people for political reasons.</p>

<p>It&#39;s forensic interruption and entities like the &quot;False Memory Syndrome Foundation&quot; are a perfect example.</p>

<p>By planting the FBI honeypot sites on the deep web, they are in the perfect place to catch people on co-opt these networks. We already know this happens. They are letting the big fish go in exchange for political influence.</p>

<p>So, while you may disagree to the extent of what MK Ultra or SRA happened or happens, I provided some really solid sources about how mass persuasion techniques work. </p>

<p>To deny that espionage and counterintelligence haven&#39;t been playing this game since Sun Tzu, is to deny what has happened throughout the history of espionage.</p>

<p>Conradus&#39; Cryptographia Denudata was a book written in latin, in the 1700s regarding cryptography. It was never published, only hand written by students who copied the text.</p>

<p>The secret of Greek Fire is lost to history. So is George Washington&#39;s invisible ink.</p>

<p>Secrets are kept by employing these techniques and history has needed these techniques for thousands of years.</p>

<p>To deny the Infiltrators aren&#39;t the ones who are most likely to be in power is to deny the second oldest profession.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So what do we do then there&#39;s obviously more people than just yourself who know and realize these things and can put them together in such a way where is isn&#39;t conspiracy or coincidence and is concrete, what can we do to help change this status quo? Obviously not everyone who attains wealth and power falls into this category of evil and must see these things as well, are they doing anything or care enough to try and do anything? What hope do we have? Obviously this subject and knowledge is becoming more common to the lay person, will that alone help? It&#39;s all discouraging for someone like myself, young, educated, with the world ahead of me but it&#39;s hard not to be discouraged and to just say fuck it and do what I can to ensure my personal security and then check out. It all feels so daunting and that no matter what I do what I become what I attain, nothing will change. Those gears will grind and there&#39;s nothing we can do to stop it, you know?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I&#39;m glad you somebody understood it.  I thought it was about as well written as the wiki page on social dreaming. Which is annoying, as I&#39;ve had a slight interest in the Tavistock institute since all those years ago when I learned (from experience) that you couldn&#39;t write the words in a GLP post without getting banned or at the very least the words being replaced with somethinf else.  Anyone else remember that?</p>

<p>Also, I have a feeling that it would all tie in with my thoughts on a particular grafitti artist. </p>

<p>My understanding is that the widespread occult symbology is the symbology of infiltration and that each religion is infiltrated by the worshipers of the Many Faced God that believes each religion is just another face.</p>

<p>Worshippers of Odin would have been no different in that they are an ideology that will be targeted for infiltration.</p>

<p>Follow this link after reading my last comment about psychedelics causing you to think reality is &quot;one.&quot; Seems innocuous. Just a church right? Well. If youve taken a psychedelic you would look at it as &quot;one&quot; continuous object. Instead of seeing walls, glass, place to sit and listen to the preacher you would something entirely different. You would immediately notice the eyes, the head and actually where the preacher sits it appears to be the mouth. A snakes head if you see it as one and do not focus on its individual parts. That is what they do &quot;throw it in your face&quot; but this stuff takes time to read and really grasp. Hence why it is called &quot;esoteric&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Have you read anything by Alister Crowley? Advertising with symbols, numbers, acronyms is how the sigil gains &quot;power.&quot;</p>

<p>There are many ways to make a sigil but here is one:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Write out your desire or manifestation.
&quot;I want to rule the world&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>Remove any vowels and repeating constanants.
&quot;WNTRLHD&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>Now start writing out those letters in various combinations -- some big, some small, letters inside letters, extending off letters, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Continue to refine this until you have something abstract and in your opinion &quot;magical&quot; looking.</p></li>
<li><p>Now comes the &quot;fun&quot; part. Lots of ways to imbue your sigil with power but a fairly common one is to masturbate to the idea/manifestation with the sigil infront of you and imagining it in your head.</p></li>
<li><p>Now go show the world your sigil, and the more people that &quot;believe&quot; in it, wear it on their t-shirt, put it on their cars, etc. means the outcome is more likely to manifest itself for you.</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>Piggybacking off of this comment, there is a guy named RoundSaturnsEye on Youtube. R$E. He goes to great lengths to explore occultist symbolism as someone who escaped from it.</p>

<p>There was a slew of smear and character assassination campaigns against him, but the fact remains that if you start from the beginning, it&#39;s really weird ahit, but you won&#39;t be able to stop seeing the symbolism all around us and what it comes from.</p>

<p>Take for instance covering one eye with the generally regarded &quot;A-okay&quot; symbol, the Eye of Horus. Skull and Crossbones. Specific kinds of imagery portrayed with the same script and mildly differing visuals.</p>

<p>That&#39;s just branding and art. Then he starts getting into real-world businesses and people. Then into the occult religious ties the symbolism has.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wrote this in another thread... you might like it:</p>

<hr/>

<p>OK, Ill assume you&#39;re seriously asking for that;</p>

<hr/>

<p>It is widely known that online-sentiment-manipulation is of great interest to all structures of power. &quot;<strong><em>Knowledge is power</em></strong>&quot; as the adage goes is true. TRUE Knowledge is the utmost power.... as it allows for one to make the correct decision if they have the absolute most information possible to them from all angles regarding an particular topic.</p>

<p>With citizens/individuals/people, knowledge of the true workings/structure/intentions/sentiments/policies/actions (lets just refer to all of that plus more as DNA) of governments, corporations, institutions, nations, societies, communities and individuals allows them to make different decisions than they would had they all the information on the DNA of the entity they are evaluating an action due to (a vote, opinion, task, support, denouncement etc... all of those we will just call actions)</p>

<p>So actions, the best course of action, is determined by having as full an understanding of the DNA of the external/opposing entity.</p>

<p>This has always been true. When governments use the term &quot;<strong><em>Winning hearts and minds</em></strong>&quot; --- this translates to &quot;<strong><em>Controlling the Emotions (hearts) and thoughts (minds)</em></strong>&quot; of a given population.</p>

<p>They gain control over H&amp;M through a myriad of ways - overt, covert, mass-scale, nuanced suggestion (deep deep topic, but we will keep it high level - and we will generically refer to the total control space as PR. Watch these two Documentaries later, but watch them twice. [Self]() &amp; [HR]() -- HR will blow your mind...</p>

<p>OK, so the above has always been true - its the nature of how sentient humans protag/antag for self interest at scale and on an individual level.... </p>

<p>so:</p>

<p>With that foundation, we have entered the &quot;<em>information age</em>&quot; -- Why is that important? Well, because prior to this age, controlling the flow of information between two endpoints or many or all endpoints was far easier (deep reasonings why, but lets just say it was easy to hide/obfuscate/fabricate an entity&#39;s DNA from another, thus stunting knowledge thus limiting another&#39;s power).</p>

<p>Now that information is as fluid as it is - veiling one&#39;s true DNA from another is more difficult. (aside: in ancient mystery schools, religions etc.. they oft equate water==thought. Thoughts are as fluid as water, thoughts flow... I can go into depth on that one in another post if you like later).</p>

<p>Now, as the mind gains more knowledge, thus more power, its a self-perpetuating motivation and desire <em>(we can do another aside on the nature of desire later too)</em> </p>

<p>With the advent of the internet and the infra we have built on top of it, you can look at something like twitter as a global sentiment litmus for certain things, the internet is in its infancy, we think its this massive powerful thing, and it is, but its still an infant. Seeing an infant start to crawl is a momentous event, then they walk, then they run, then they learn to speak, then they think! then they LIVE their own path....</p>

<p>The internet is still an infant who just learned to Walk.</p>

<p>ok, now to the actual question:</p>

<p>People inherently are averse to lies/manipulation/exploitation/evil in general... </p>

<p>But those are the tools that HumanKind has wielded for eons to hold power, and again <strong><em>knowledge</em></strong> IS power - so if those are the tools used by the systems of Civilization to control power, then <strong><em>that</em></strong> is their DNA --- having an understanding of the nature of that DNA by the entities a system is trying to control depletes/destroys/diminishes the power that system has of that other entity&#39;s H&amp;M needed to be developed; enter online-sentiment-manipulation, based on the DNA that they only know: lies, deceit, deception, etc....</p>

<p>So -- Eglin AFB, and many many other organizations and governments are evolving  the tools and PR machine used to manipulation the H&amp;M of populations, but recall that humans are innately averse to lies and deceit etc... so they have to use these new tactics, which obviously we are all now aware of, astroturfing, sliding, shilling, etc... etc... so that the sentiment-manipulation is done so such that the narrative desired by one entity <strong><em>appears</em></strong> to be coming from the <em>peer group</em> of the people being manipulated, as the under-educated mind who lacks critical thinking sills and a historic-memory of past negative actions of the manipulator will tend to go with that group-think....</p>

<p>Thats what eglin and others and all the IC pretty much are doing.</p>

<p>Then we layer in cyber war and conventional war-for-distraction-profit-population control, and the conversation gets even more interesting.</p>

<p>(I have to get off the train now - ill come back and edit spelling and add links to the docs later today.)</p>

<p>Hope this helps though....</p>

<p>The same problem that surrounded the assassination of JFK who understood the very real and ever-present dangers of a nuclear war in taking any hard-line positions and tempting fate with proxy wars rather than reaching some form of reasonable compromise and accommodation with any supposed enemies that had no more to gain from such a potentially devastating war than the US did, or exacerbating relations with them in a full-blown proxy war like Vietnam where the US even went so far as to actively participate in and fight a war that the vast majority Vietnamese people themselves wanted no part of and were unwilling to genuinely fight for themselves. And the list of such wars and events simply goes on and on in a world that no nation even comes close to the US in terms of making it as dangerous, unpredictable, and unstable as it is with hundreds of billions of dollars being spent on doing just that instead of using them to do just the opposite.</p>

<p>And I&#39;ll just add to your excellent observations about the JFK coup, that the government made a point of executing him in broad daylight as a display of their power and a warning to others who might stand in their way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>His answer reminded me of BCCI (Bank of Credit and Commerce International):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Investigators in the US and the UK revealed that BCCI had been &quot;set up deliberately to avoid centralized regulatory review, and operated extensively in bank secrecy jurisdictions. Its affairs were extraordinarily complex. Its officers were sophisticated international bankers whose apparent objective was to keep their affairs secret, to commit fraud on a massive scale, and to avoid detection.&quot;</p>

<p>In addition to violations of lending laws, BCCI was also accused of opening accounts or laundering money for figures such as Saddam Hussein, Manuel Noriega, Hussain Mohammad Ershad and Samuel Doe,[11] and for criminal organizations such as the Medellin Cartel and Abu Nidal.[12] Police and intelligence experts nicknamed B.C.C.I. the &quot;Bank of Crooks and Criminals&quot; for its penchant for catering to customers who dealt in arms, drugs and hot money.[13]</p>

<p>William von Raab, a former U.S. Commissioner of Customs, also told the Kerry Committee that the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency held &quot;several&quot; accounts at BCCI. According to a 1991 article in Time magazine, the National Security Council also had accounts at BCCI, which were used for a variety of covert operations, including transfers of money and weapons for Iran-Contra.</p>

<p>Learn some tradecraft before you try to pull a stunt like starting a &quot;citizen&#39;s protection force.&quot; You can&#39;t even tell the difference between COINTELPRO and someone who is trying to keep you safe.

    <div class="md"><p>Yes that is my impression of the man too.</p>

<p>Seems like you&#39;d need to watch his entire YouTube channel consisting of what, thousands of videos, just to get an idea what the guy is talking about. Nobody has time for that shit, and I think it&#39;s by design he hasn&#39;t given us a summary of his findings, or even a summary of what the fuck he&#39;s talking about. Just a bunch of videos like &quot;DAY 213.3&quot; with slim context. </p>

<p>If I was going to intentionally make my YouTube channel/my messages hard for people to understand, I&#39;d do them exactly like George Webb has. </p>

<p>Where is the video explaining the story in the OP even? I want to see where he &quot;figures out&quot; the Seth Rich killer. Pretty fucking bold statement if you ask me, I&#39;m sure he put it out there and made it easy to find, right?</p>

<p>Nah.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a shame you were downvoted for this, as it&#39;s totally valid.  I said the same in a different comment.

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly - that&#39;s my fear. That this guy has set up his YouTube channel in such a way that idiot conspiracy nuts are literally the only ones who give him the time of day.

<p>This is the most significant problem.  It&#39;s so much like pizzagate, it&#39;s unreal.  Had people been <strong>a lot</strong> more critical, and not burned out all the rational thinkers with completely irrational bullshit, something may have panned out.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve said it a few times since this sub fractured into two halves, there&#39;s a movement, largely by the pro-trump crowd but not entirely one sided, in which people are trying to suppress actual sources and information in favor of circlejerking, or creating an echo-chamber.</p>

<p>People are so set on their current story being proved right that they&#39;re literally happy to take a handful of comments by people who happen to agree with them as fact, and will ignore anyone proving that original post wrong with platitudes like &quot;MSM can&#39;t be trusted&quot;, &quot;a shill would say that&quot;, etc.</p>

<p>I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s an attempt to make this subreddit even less believable, that someone somewhere decided this type of discussion has the potential to be harmful to them so they opted to start a movement in which facts are supressed and emotion comes out on top so that no one takes us seriously when we land on something real and big.</p>

<p>At no point until 7 months ago was i ever downvoted on this subreddit for providing sources, or asking for a source, since then it happens a majority of the time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure, without a doubt.  All claims should be looked at independently. 
 But it&#39;s not outlandish for people to make the Seth Rich/pro-Trump connection, as <em>much</em> of the narrative regarding Seth Rich <em>is</em> pro-Trump.

<p>The leap of assuming that because two gangsters died that they must be connected. And assuming that they would contract out covert work like this to a couple amateur gangbangers who would snitch in an instant to cut their sentence if caught. </p>

<p>The leap that a car dealership is used to provide covert vehicles when a dealership would require tons of paperwork and make the cars easily traced back to them. Even if they bought it with cash any identifiable information could easily be traced to them from the original owner. If they&#39;re stripping all that information then why bother having a fake car dealership, just buy beaters on Craigslist. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s my theory: Georgie here is trying to get in on that Alex Jones cash cow.</p>

<p>I like Georige. In fact, I have a crush on him (not really) but I&#39;ve become a little dubious of him. I mean, if Seth supposedly got killed for leaking info, how is George (who is extremely visible) allowed to live to talk? (same with Alex Jones).
One has to be careful who they trust. Or at minimum, consider the source and the questionable agenda.</p>

With 10 uploads a day, it&#39;s tough to go back and glean useful information from these videos if you&#39;re coming in new to this. He should do weekly recaps of important information or something. </p>

<p>Also doesn&#39;t it seem odd he&#39;s broadcasting exactly where he is in these videos? Seems like an easy person to make a hit on... but maybe that&#39;s his intention and the obsessive documentation protects him because if he&#39;s killed it only adds credibility to what he&#39;s saying and we&#39;ll know exactly where he was killed? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I noticed that once he moved away from just filming his screen, and started showing his face, he&#39;d always make a point to show where he was. He&#39;d have his satnav on while driving, and draw attention to the fact that we now knew exactly where he was, point out landmarks and name locations, etc. (Even before he started to do more on-foot location-based investigations.) I think it&#39;s actually a more effective form of protection than keeping identities, locations and destinations secret. </p>

<p>I agree that he makes it near impossible to pick up the series part way through. And to those who just began watching lately, and missed all the groundwork he laid out earlier, he&#39;s just going to seem nuts. Especially since he&#39;s understandably gone into the rambling, no filter, infodump mode of someone who&#39;s not sure if these will be their last moments. Earlier, he is calm and considered, explaining concepts well, etc. But those videos have kind of gotten buried.</p>

<p>I bet he found the last pieces of the puzzle a couple days ago. I say this because thats when there started to be 4000+ users logged on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> all day.

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, I&#39;ll bite, whatever.</p>

<p>As someone who comes into this sub maybe once a week to see what&#39;s up, threads like this are incredibly unsatisfying and, in my opinion, do more to harm the validity of the claims than to cement them as fact.</p>

<p>When someone says &quot;Can someone summarize this for me?&quot; and the best response is a link to a 14 minute video of someone pointing at his computer screen with a bunch of seemingly unrelated things, it all just comes across as noise.</p>

<p>Honestly, if this guy is as close to finding the truth as people seem to think he is, there is nothing stopping him, or one of his supporters, from distilling all of the evidence into a super-concentrated executive summary video that ties it all together in a minute or two, nothing more.</p>

<p>Then, if that theory holds water, people can delve into the finer details to see whether or not it makes sense and can withstand scrutiny.</p>

<p>As it currently stands, it&#39;s kind of like throwing the ocean at people and claiming &quot;Oh, there&#39;s a giant squid in there, you just have to find it!&quot; Yeah, when you&#39;re trying to prove something with as much resistance as this has against it, that methodology is not going to work.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>I think it&#39;s Bush&#39;s no child left behind bullshit, forcing memorization for tests over critical thinking. They need to be told how to think. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Rote memorization has always been part of that misguided approach to education.  If you haven&#39;t looked into it, check out the Skull and Bones Society&#39;s role in education as documented by Charlotte Iserbyt (senior policy advisor on education under the reagan administration) and Antony C Sutton (Hoover institution Economics Scholar).  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDyDtYy2I0M">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDyDtYy2I0M</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>I think they really do want a dictator. Makes it easier to know how to feel as they lack that skill set</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ve noticed this recently, too. People are so overwhelmed with (dis) information that is too difficult to parse and is constantly being refuted, that it&#39;s become necessary to people to just stand strong on their beliefs and it&#39;s driving emotions. I suspect that it&#39;s just an aspect of tribalism and mass- psychology that&#39;s being used against us.</p>

<p>It&#39;s certainly been exploited by the group leading the &quot;deplorables&quot;, who on reddit used the same meme and circlejerk strategies that we&#39;ve seen successfully employed by other social activist identity groups on here.  But remember that what you are seeing there is a vocal minority which is deliberately taking up more space than they represent, to appear much larger than they are.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I do not understand why the only narrative that&#39;s not ok to question is Trumps to his supporters. They are questioning WaPo, neocons, NYT, neo cons, dems, liberals, even fox news at times... But never the one fed to them by the Trump propaganda machine.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&quot;4d chess&quot;.  The Trump supporters see him as combatting the enemy, so they aren&#39;t worried about vetting the validity of his propaganda.  I think the core supporters you&#39;re seeing are &quot;reactive&quot; in that they&#39;re goaded into reacting AGAINST what they see as an existential threat.  </p>

<p>That&#39;s happening on &quot;both sides&quot; of the political dichotomy right now, though it&#39;s traditionally been a term reserved for &quot;conservatives&quot;.  I&#39;m seeing the dualistic bating being pushed very hard by the media right now and the divide is growing more and more between what the two sides believe.  Belief no longer just refers to values, but to FACTS and what is objectively true.  Pick a side or rot.  That&#39;s the postmodernist political sphere we&#39;re currently dwelling in.</p>

I&#39;m not sure what your slapdash diagnosis is supposed to mean, but I have known people who have paranoid schizophrenia and people who have schitzo-affective disorder, and that&#39;s not what&#39;s going on at all.
