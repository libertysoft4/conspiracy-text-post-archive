I&#39;m not against Trunp or for Hillery. I&#39;m am, however, against shills, brigading, and other vote manipulation, and it&#39;s pretty obvious that it is going on here.</p>

<p>One more post to kill! Let&#39;s see if the intentional typos prevent this one from getting caught by whatever kind of bot is catching these.</p>

<p><em>edit</em></p>

<p>It took less than a minute for someone to downvote this. Posts like this are being intentionally silenced. If you don&#39;t believe me, just check controversial and new, and see for yourself.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re reading this and you don&#39;t usually take the time to vote, you should upvote. Presumably they are winning because most people don&#39;t vote, while they are literally on the lookout for posts and comments to downvote and silence.</p>

<p><em>edit2</em></p>

<p>Presumably this one is intentionally being let through to illustrate that there isn&#39;t actually a problem.</p>

<p>Really though, <strong>check controversial and new for yourself</strong>. And then, look at the bottom of the comments in all of the posts around here, and take a look at which comments are consistently in the negatives and yet have no responses. The narrative is being manipulated.</p>

<p><em>edit</em></p>

<p>Better yet, try it yourself. Make a post and include a few key terms and see how long it takes for it to be downvoted. I bet it&#39;s less than a minute. Presumably there&#39;s some kind of bot watching for new submissions with certain keywords. Why anyone would care enough to do this is beyond me, but I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if it&#39;s moreso bored trolls than anything else.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re not gonna get proof of a  Trump Russia connection from any of us because we aren&#39;t the ones investigating him. I wasn&#39;t there when Kushner met with Russian bankers. I wasn&#39;t on the phone when Flynn talked to the Russians about sanctions. I have no idea what Manafort was up to. None of us do. I really don&#39;t see the point in chanting over and over that the Russia connection is made up. If it&#39;s not true, we&#39;ll see at the end of the investigation. </p>

<p>Is it possible that all these Trump cronies that he was forced to fire w were up to some shady deal with Russia? Fuck yeah its possible. Two head cronies fired. His attorney general recused himself after lying to Congress. Then Trump fires the guy investigating him because he won&#39;t back off. I&#39;ve got no fuckin clue why anybody could look at all this shit and say &quot;Yeah so what&#39;s your point?&quot;</p>

<p>This is a conspiracy sub. This stuff should definitely set off alarm bells. But there are tons of Trump supporters here so they don&#39;tcare about anything bad for Trump. Even if Trump was caught red handed making a deal with Russians and got impeached, they would think it&#39;d all a ruse and the deep state is overthrowing him because he&#39;s just too edgy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not even saying that the Russia shit isn&#39;t true. I just want them to release all the information because from what I&#39;ve seen around here the evidence amounts to stuff like &quot;wikileaks doesn&#39;t leak enough Russia stuff so they must work for Russia cuz Russia benefits.&quot; it&#39;s probably all true, I just want to see the proof instead of hearing about it from anonymous sources. I know the CIA often lies and propagandizes so I just wish someone would catch Trump on tape while he&#39;s selling us out to other countries. The government is feuding and its fascinating to watch, it&#39;s just hard for me to be sure about what&#39;s really happening.</p>

<p>They acted like reporting on the Clinton email server and evidence deletion was pointless propaganda from russia but mishandling intelligence and then covering it up is a huge deal, just look at Trump. With Clinton we had proof of misconduct and I was told to ignore it all because it doesnt matter. With this there is no proof and I&#39;m told it&#39;s really important and he needs to be impeached for it immediately. The way all of this stuff is talked about makes me doubt it probably more than I should. I just want to figure out what is propaganda and what&#39;s real but I&#39;m just not clever enough</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What news are you watching? Yeah CNN and MNBC are going to have people on that talk about this a lot and some will mention impeachment if he was obstructing justice. But fox won&#39;t tell you that. During the Clinton thing, it was the opposite. Fox talked all day every day about how big a deal Clinton&#39;s server was. And how she should go to jail. </p>

<p>Hillary server took a year to investigate. This one might take that long too. It&#39;s not like the FBI gives us updates. They tell us when it&#39;s over. </p>

<p>If the media made all this shit up then why would Trump fire 2 guys because of their Russia connection? Why did he fire Comey? He could have fired Comey right away but he waited until now. Why? Trump has never backed down because the media jumped on him. Never. So why buckle and fire two of his main guys? It&#39;s definitely weird man and there is a clear possibility that something is up. We don&#39;t know yet. We should all be patient and see what happens. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My friends are mostly liberals and in the past I&#39;ve gravitated towards msnbc. I have no idea what fox news is talking about but yeah I could see how they would be pounding away about the email server. I mostly just know my friends, Bernie Sanders, Gary Johnson, and Clinton herself telling me to ignore the email thing and how comey was a bad guy for doing political investigations. Obama saying the election could never be hacked and people talking about election riggung were just trying to divide America based on hate. Nobody I know is a Trump supporter, but I know tons of Democrats so I get more pissed about my friends acting unreasonably than I do the actual guys in power. I just thought everyone already knows Trump is awful but some of my friends think whatever war hawk candidate would be amazing. I want Trump to lose next election but I just hope we get some good people running because being better than Trump isn&#39;t the same as being good.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I&#39;m in the same boat dude. I&#39;m not friends with a ton of conservatives but I enjoy a nice debate. I used to participate in r/politics often but now it&#39;s such a heavy circle jerk that it&#39;s just a group of parrots squawking at each other. That why I like. oming here. There&#39;s usually a good debate. Hillary sucked balls for sure. No swag what so ever. But I still think the policies of the Democrats are looking out for people like me. I want to keep my healthcare. I&#39;m a musician so I don&#39;t have a regular job. If my healthcare goes away, I have to get another job. And tax cuts for the rich again? Again? Give me a break. They are doing fine. That&#39;s why I vote Democrat personally. </p>

<p>There is a lot of ridiculous outrage over anything Trump says. I don&#39;t give a shit about what he does unless it directly effects me. But right now I&#39;m embarrassed as an American with our allies. I played a private party tonight and everyone there was Muslim. Some business people. They all worry about leaving the country because they aren&#39;t sure if they are allowed back.  There&#39;s just a lot of hate going around because Trump soemohow made it cool to be a dick to people. That&#39;s what I really don&#39;t like. I wish we could all just chill out. </p>

<p>I think it&#39;s possible trump and Kushner have big business connections in Russia and this alliance was for money. We don&#39;t know yet. But I&#39;m just gonna wait to see what the FBI says.</p>

<p>What they really do is coordinate on which posts to promote, use their bots to push those posts up, and quickly fill them with comments to establish narrative dominance. I think they also coordinate on which subjects to derail as well, and do that as the opportunity presents itself. </p>

<p>Doesn&#39;t even need to be an army. I bet like 10 people with the right resources could completely derail the sub. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This whole &quot;bot/shill/brigading&quot; thing has got to stop. most posts i see accusing others of being one of these evil things is itself an account that looks like it was specifically created for anonymity and for the post in question.</p>

<p>OP, its possible you are a throwaway account, i would say most likely even. however, you could easily be called a shill, a bot, a brigader by the most common definitions of these terms in this context based on your own post history (or more specifically the lack thereof).</p>

<p>these tactics of calling people who disagree with you a shill, a bot, whatever is a dehumanizing tactic. its meant to divide and cut off the possibility of compromise. its also meant to permit people to stand by while terrible things are done to others. the nazis, among many, were masters of this subject.</p>

<p>so as a lurker, or purely observer, i have started to comment on this particular subject to point out the fallacies of these arguments, to point out the hypocrisy of these arguments. but most importantly, to highlight the effect this has on us as a community. </p>
