<p>That Russia should</p>

<blockquote>
<p>introduce geopolitical disorder into internal American activity, encouraging all kinds of separatism and ethnic, social and racial conflicts, actively supporting all dissident movements – extremist, racist, and sectarian groups, thus destabilizing internal political processes in the U.S. It would also make sense simultaneously to support isolationist tendencies in American politics.&quot;</p>

<p>Both parties are against this, and it is increasingly pitting them against their constituents.  The democrats pushed through a health care act written by the insurance companies, and scrapped the public option completely when they controlled the house and the senate. </p>

<p>It was Clinton who passed welfare reform in the 90&#39;s. </p>

<p>There is a civil war in the democratic party right now between the progressive wing and the corporatists who control it.  Because, right now, both parties are neo-liberal. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

<p>He shares an ideology with many democrats and conservatives. Neo-conservative in foreign policy, and neo-liberal in economic. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>And while he was a let down in many ways it has been the continued fight for change that is under discussion here.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We need to do an empirical analysis not a partisan one. And when you do an empirical analysis it becomes clear that there has been a bipartisan effort that pushes through policies that are pro-corporate, and pro-war. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Conservatives want to roll us back to the 1700&#39;s and fight progression. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Statements like this don&#39;t really help.   Conservatism in this country is poorly defined just as liberal, and is a part of identity politics.  What appears to have happened is that liberalism, as in classic liberalism,  co-opted that term.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They push their religion and &#39;patriotism&#39;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There was a movement in the Republican party to court and pander to the Evangelicals, but while it was initially successful it splintered the party.  However, there are theocratic tendencies in this country that court the government. But, again they have bipartisan membership and support.  Check out the C-street book. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not a victim. I&#39;ve talked to plenty of liberals and seen plenty of people share the sentiment in person and online, &quot;if you voted for/support Trump in any way you are a _______ And I don&#39;t want to be friends with you.&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s literally this exact social climate that caused people to vote for Trump. The virtue signalling left is allowed to project its ills onto the rest of society, and ordinary people get demonized en masse for going even slightly against the grain. </p>

<p>We can also talk about how the conservatives are evil douchebags if you would rather have a pleasant conversation from this point forward, just so you know. I just happen to think the liberals are also douchebags.</p>

<p>I understand where you&#39;re coming from but I think you need to be more careful with the way you phrase things.

    <div class="md"><p>I can totally understand and respect that. I think that, unfortunately, both sides latch onto MSM programming. It gets those who are already liberal to adopt the language and talking points, and it gets those who are already conservative to feel targeted (even when it&#39;s only a media talking point and it never catches on in actual society).</p>

<p>You&#39;re absolutely right, it&#39;s divide and conquer at its finest. I&#39;ll try to do a better job at framing my argument​ in the future; thank you for the feedback.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The book was not written by Russian Generals. It was written by Dugin, who is a crackpot, and taken seriously by a small number on the extreme right.  Moreover, it did not advocate anything you just wrote, except for mentioning it in the following context.</p>

<p>Here is the beginning of the paragraph.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>At the global level, the construction of the planetary New Empire will be dominated by the USA, whose undermining (up to the complete destruction of this geopolitical construction) will be implemented systematically and uncompromisingly by all the participants of the New Empire.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Dugin is fantasizing about a creation of a New Empire where Eurasia plays a central part.  He states South America can be realigned through Spain, a participant of the New Empire, etc. The realignment of central and south america can be also helped, at this future time by supporting opposition forces in the States:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Eurasian project assumes in this respect the Eurasian expansion to South and Central America with a view to withdrawing it from the control of the North (here the Spanish factor can be used as a traditional alternative to the Anglo-Saxon one), as well as provoking all kinds of instability and separatism within the borders of the USA It is possible to rely on the political forces of African-American racists).</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>The book was co-authored by General Nikolai Klokotov of the General Staff Academy.[1] Colonel General Leonid Ivashov, head of the International Department of the Russian Ministry of Defence, apparently advised in the project.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ll own forgetting to mention Dugin but he wasn&#39;t the only author. Beyond that, the last 20 years of history falls right in line with most of the geopolitical goals the book promotes. One of the main ones being spreading anti-Americanism.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Yes he was. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Beyond that, the last 20 years of history falls right in line with most of the geopolitical goals the book promotes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is not true. Dugin himself wrote a book Putin Vs. Putin. There Dugin offers the following critique:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Labour No. 1: He has not fully completed the
first six points.</p>

<p>Labour No. 2: He has not finally made up his
mind concerning relations with the United States.</p>

<p>Labour No. 3: He has not understood the deadend nature of using the radical-liberal paradigm
in economics.</p>

<p>Labour No. 4: He has not implemented a
rotation of the political elite. The old political
apparatus is still working according to the
previous model and its seeming technical
efficiency conceals its fundamental inadequacy.</p>

<p>Labour No. 5: He has not gathered an efficient
team of his own that he could call upon for
assistance in the process of further reform.</p>

<p>Labour No. 6: He has not yet tackled in earnest
the strengthening of the Eurasian ideology as the
basis of Russia’s place in the world of the future.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Further on in the book:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>All the steps he
took in the Eurasian direction — the
strengthening of relations with the Asian states,
the integration processes within EurAsEC, the
partnership with Europe, and so on can be
regarded as successful. The concessions he made
to the US were failures.</p>

<p>And that is when the Putin formula,
‘liberalism + nationalism’, was born. Its real
author is unknown to me: among its alleged
authors are Boris Berezovsky, Gleb Pavlovsky,
Vladislav Surkov, and so on. This position was
situated strictly between the liberal elite and the
nationally- and socially-inclined masses.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Further down:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The setback occurred in the wake of9/11. The US
offered Russia, almost as an ultimatum, a loyalty
test, and Putin did not resolve to answer it in a
strictly Eurasian fashion. His Eurasian tendencies
weakened, which led to the establishment of
Western military bases in the CIS and Georgia, a
deterioration in relations with Lukashenko,[103]
and so forth. Putin’s advisor Sergei
Yastrzhembsky[104] then directly opposed
Eurasianism. All of the above significantly
weakened the integrity and credibility of Putin’s
initial formula and reduced the patriotic potential
of his political status</p>

<p>This was
manifested by the reduction of the Eurasian
potential in foreign policy (a shift towards the
West, yielding to the pressure of the US, and the
slowing down of the integration process in the
CIS); in the relative connivance to the new wave
ofrebellions among some national leaders; and in
the absence of an explicit and consistent patriotic
ideology in the media, education and culture.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Dugin is highly critical throughout of Putin&#39;s liberal leanings. For him liberalism is failing and in order to save itself it will push for a confrontation with Russia.  Dugin wants a seat at the table for sure, but he does not have one!</p>

<p>In Europe:</p>

<ul>
<li>Germany should be offered the de facto political dominance over most Protestant and Catholic states located within Central and Eastern Europe. Kaliningrad oblast could be given back to Germany. The book uses the term &quot;Moscow-Berlin axis&quot;.[1]</li>
<li>France should be encouraged to form a &quot;Franco-German bloc&quot; with Germany. Both countries have a &quot;firm anti-Atlanticist tradition&quot;.[1]</li>
<li>The United Kingdom should be cut off from Europe.[1]
Finland should be absorbed into Russia. Southern Finland will be combined with the Republic of Karelia and northern Finland will be &quot;donated to Murmansk Oblast&quot;.[1]
Estonia should be given to Germany&#39;s sphere of influence.[1]</li>
<li>Latvia and Lithuania should be given a &quot;special status&quot; in the Eurasian-Russian sphere.[1]</li>
<li>Poland should be granted a &quot;special status&quot; in the Eurasian sphere.[1]</li>
<li>Romania, Macedonia, &quot;Serbian Bosnia&quot; and Greece – &quot;orthodox collectivist East&quot; – will unite with &quot;Moscow the Third Rome&quot; and reject the &quot;rational-individualistic West&quot;.[1]</li>
<li>Ukraine should be annexed by Russia because &quot;Ukraine as a state has no geopolitical meaning, no particular cultural import or universal significance, no geographic uniqueness, no ethnic exclusiveness, its certain territorial ambitions represents an enormous danger for all of Eurasia and, without resolving the Ukrainian problem, it is in general senseless to speak about continental politics&quot;. Ukraine should not be allowed to remain independent, unless it is cordon sanitaire, which would be inadmissible.[1]</li>

<p>This doesn&#39;t describe Russia over the last 20 years?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The book does advocate realignment with Berlin, I will let the readers judge how seriously that is being pursued. </p>

<p>The book outlines that France is an atlanticist power, but that there a political tendency looking for strenghtening continental ties, so it does judge that German-French connection is best for continental integration. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The United Kingdom should be cut off from Europe.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The book does not advocate this.  What it advocates is that nationalist movements should be supported, like the Scottish and the Irish, so that the United Kingdom can be dissolved and ethnic units made. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Finland should be absorbed into Russia</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is false the book explicitly advocates the creation of a Scandinavian unit.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>2) Around Prussia begins the process of strategic association of the Baltic states into a single unit. The unit consists of Norway, Sweden, Germany, Estonia, Finland, Karelia, Denmark may, Netherlands. Special status is delegated to Poland, Lithuania and Latvia. Mandatory condition for a way out of all the countries of NATO and the establishment of the Baltic Sea demilitarized zone. In the long term strategic control goes to Moscow and BC &quot;neutral&quot; in Europe, ie the Eurasian defense complex.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This has nothing to do with Russian policy in the last 20 years.</p>

<p>Ukraine should not be annexed, rather Dugin calls for the dissolution of the unit along ethnic lines, etc. </p>

<p>If you are interested in a good analysis of Russian behavior check out John Mearsheimer&#39;s lectures on geopolitcs and Ukraine. </p>

<p>As far as I can find, this seems to come from the Hoover institutions which does not offer any evidence for the claim.</p>

<p>The book itself lists Dugin as the author, and he has the rights over the title:</p>
