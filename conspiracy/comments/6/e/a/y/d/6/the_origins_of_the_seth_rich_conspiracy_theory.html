        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>For a while now I&#39;ve felt like the Seth Rich &quot;conspiracy&quot; was nothing more than baseless propaganda being used in a disinformation campaign to take the focus off of the current FBI investigation into Russia&#39;s attempts to influence our election on Trump&#39;s behalf.  </p>

<p>After absorbing a lot of information (and disinformation), one question kept coming back to me over and over. Where did the Seth Rich conspiracy originate? And more importantly, are there any links to the original source and the current narrative?   </p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen a lot of people make a lot of claims in terms of where this all started, so I decided to do my own research and this is what I&#39;ve found.  </p>

<ul>
<li>July 10th 2016 - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Seth_Rich">Seth Rich is murdered.</a><br/></li>
<li>July 13th 2016 - <a href="http://archive.is/RxXMb">The first published article</a> tying Seth Rich&#39;s murder to the DNC is released from whatdoesitmean.com. The article claims Rich thought he was on his way to meet with the FBI about the Clinton Foundation when he was gunned down by a hit squad. The source used for the entire article was a report from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Intelligence_Service_(Russia)">Russia&#39;s Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR)</a>. </li>
</ul>

<p>From the article.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>A somber Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) report circulating in the Kremlin today says that a top American Democratic Party staffer preparing to testify against Hillary Clinton was assassinated this past Sunday during a secret meeting in Washington D.C. he believed he was having with Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agents, but who turned out, instead, to be a “hit team”—and who, in turn, were captured yesterday after a running gun battle with US federal police forces just blocks from the White House. [Note: Some words and/or phrases appearing in quotes are English language approximations of Russian words/phrases having no exact counterpart.] </p>
</blockquote>

<p>More on SVR.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Unlike the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB), the SVR is responsible for intelligence and espionage activities outside the Russian Federation.</strong> It works in cooperation with the Russian Main Intelligence Agency (Russian: Гла́вное разве́дывательное управле́ние, tr. Glavnoye razvedyvatel&#39;noye upravleniye; IPA: [ˈglavnəjə rɐzˈvʲɛdɨvətʲɪlʲnəjə ʊprɐˈvlʲenʲɪjə]) (GRU), which reportedly deployed six times as many spies in foreign countries as the SVR in 1997.[2] </p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you read the entire article, you can see it was tailored to include all of the popular Clinton conspiracy buzzwords that were being pushed at the time. Clinton Foundation, Pay to Play, Slush Fund, Child Sex, etc. </p>

<p>Now let&#39;s look at how this narrative has evolved.  </p>

<ul>
<li>May 24th 2017 - We see a <a href="http://archive.is/lndTb">new article</a> from whatdoesitmean.com also citing a Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) report &quot;circulating in the Kremlin&quot;. </li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Another intriguing Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) report circulating in the Kremlin today detailing the surging “Deep State” war against President Donald Trump states that the Seth Rich “trap” gambit, which destroyed former FBI Director James Comey, appears ready to be sprung in its entirety—and whose effects once sprung will be the complete destruction of the US mainstream propaganda media and its leftist Democratic Party masters.  [Note: Some words and/or phrases appearing in quotes in this report are English language approximations of Russian words/phrases having no exact counterpart.]<br/>
According to this report, Seth Rich was the Deputy Director Data for Voter Protection/Expansion who had helped develop a computer program for the Democratic National Committee (DNC) allowing people to type in their address and get a map to their polling place, but as a supporter of Bernie Sanders became appalled over Hillary Clinton’s “rigging the system” allowing her to become the Democratic Party nominee for president, thus causing him to release tens-of-thousands of secret DNC documents and emails to Wikileaks.<br/>
With Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman John Podesta having previously warned, on 22 February 2015, that “I’m definitely for making an example of a suspected leaker whether or not we have any real basis for it”, this report continues, the SVR became “alarmed/highly concerned” when, during early July 2016, intercepted signals traffic in the United States “suggested/leaned towards” that Seth Rich’s life might be in danger—and that SVR Director Mikhail Fradkov authorized an emergency contact between his agency and the US State Department to reveal the details of—but, and shockingly, when Russian diplomats presented the SVR findings to US authorities, on 7 July, they were immediately expelled from the United States—and as we had detailed in our 13 July 2016 report titled “Assassination Of Top US Democratic Party Official Leads To FBI Capture Of Clinton “Hit Team”.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Notice the change in narrative dropping all mention of the Clinton Foundation and slush funds and switching to the current &quot;Rich was a disgruntled Bernie bro that leaked the DNC emails&quot; narrative du jour complete with Podesta email quote.   </p>

<p>Various propagandists are now co-opting this narrative. If you look at the latest round of George Webb videos being posted it seems like his &quot;219 days&quot; of &quot;investigation&quot; is pretty much based on the new article I posted from whatdoesitmean.com, which cites a <strong>new SVR report</strong>.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Three days later, on 10 July, this report grimly notes, Seth Rich was assassinated with his believed to be assassins captured by US federal police forces after a running gun battle two days later on 12 July—and who were named in their original charging documents as 19-year-old Keyante Edwards, 18-year-old Alpha Jalloh and 20-year-old Keith Jones—all three of whom have completely disappeared from all US record searches of those charged with and/or convicted of crimes.<br/>
Of the most important of these three believed to be assassins of Seth Rich, this report says, is Alpha Jalloh, whom though identified in his Washington D.C charging document as being 18-years-old, the SVR had previously identified, in 2015, as being 26-years-old and a “high level fence and shipper” belonging to an international car theft criminal organization operating in New York City and New Jersey.<br/>
In fact, this report continues, it was through the SVR’s electronic surveillance of Alpha Jalloh that concerns were first raised about Seth Rich when in early July, 2016, this international criminal, who had been “suspiciously” released after his 2015 arrest, and believed to be an FBI informant, was discovered to be in direct contact with both Hillary Clinton’s New York City campaign office and the DNC office in Washington D.C..</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;ll notice the article above pre-dates Webb&#39;s &quot;<a href="http://archive.is/7Hbz6">219 days</a>&quot; video by 6 days. </p>

<p>Now, the question I&#39;m left with is who is Sorcha Faal and where are these SVR &quot;reports&quot; coming from? As of now, I have yet to find any official source for the SVR reports. I have been able to track down the following information about &quot;Sorcha Faal&quot;. </p>

<p>The website whatdoesitmean.com is using a private registrar so no owner information is available.  </p>

<p><a href="http://archive.is/veETn">Here is a post</a> from abovetopsecret.com with information suggesting Sorcha Faal is David Booth, an author who&#39;s written several conspiracy-related books.  </p>

<p>Interestingly enough, &quot;Sorcha Faal&quot; seems to be an anagram for &quot;As of Rachal&quot;. David Booth&#39;s daughter&#39;s name is Rachal. Feel free to run down the Rachal Booth rabbit hole, I&#39;m currently doing so myself.</p>

<p><a href="http://archive.is/6I6s6">More info</a> on the Sorcha Faal / David Booth connection.</p>

<p>I will come back and update this post as I find new information about Sorcha Faal / David Booth and these SVR reports that seem to be steering the Seth Rich narrative.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most human beings over the age of ... oh, I dunno, 12? 10? ... will invent the story for themselves the moment that they realize that WikiLeaks&#39; story is a threat to the DNC and that Seth Rich might have been the source of that story. Your claim to have traced that thought back to its internet wide OP is absurd, the amount of effort that you&#39;ve invested in trying to substantiate an absurd claim makes me distrust your motives for making it, the method that you are using to inveigle your absurd claim into r/conspiracy is familiar, and ... here&#39;s the big one ... your claim is not even relevant to the story because it cannot help to discover whether Seth Rich was or was not murdered in an effort to suppress the WikiLeaks.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not trying to substantiate any claims, I&#39;m just trying to track down where the Seth Rich conspiracy came from and I think I&#39;ve been fairly successful. You can doubt my motives all you want, the actual information I&#39;ve presented here is accurate.  </p>

<p>Who introduced the Seth Rich conspiracy and who continues to push this fake news is very relevant to the story.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>it cannot help to discover whether Seth Rich was or was not murdered in an effort to suppress WikiLeaks  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>He wasn&#39;t, that&#39;s already been established. In order to make that leap you need evidence, and there is no evidence that Rich leaked the DNC emails.  </p>

<p>I have no idea. What I do know is whoever produced those SVR reports not only introduced the whole conspiracy, but they also continue to control the narrative we see today. </p>

<p>That is pretty much the conclusion I&#39;ve come to on my own. For some strange reason, whatdoesitmean.com seems to get these SVR reports before anyone else, and these reports seem to provide the narrative (first) that all the other propagandists are following. Maybe whatdoesitmean.com is some kind of disinfo clearing house to make sure everyone sticks to the same narrative? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is really interesting if true.  Looking through the news, the Seth Rich conspiracies don&#39;t seem to be in the US media until the second week of August.  The first article I could find was in Snopes and it sites the whatdoesitmean post on July 15th: <a href="http://www.snopes.com/seth-conrad-rich/">http://www.snopes.com/seth-conrad-rich/</a></p>

<p>Wikileaks didn&#39;t start talking about Seth Rich until about August 9th or so, so after the DNC emails are released.</p>

<p>Really interesting the way the story morphed as time went on.  Within two days of his murder, people want to tie it to Clinton so make up a story about election fraud or some unknown case against Clinton.  After Wikileaks gets the DNC emails, of course the story changes.  If Wiki really got the emails from Seth, why weren&#39;t they on this story sooner?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the work here. I&#39;ve been meaning to do something similar re: the birth and spread of Pizzagate, but the swirl of /pol makes it tough. As if the Russian embassy in London wasn&#39;t enough of a tip that this is at its core a disinfo campaign, SVR being the source of this thing&#39;s birth is just about as much confirmation of origin as necessary. Also leads me to re-believe in the possibility that Russian intelligence in the US (get ready for it pedes) was behind Seth&#39;s murder before turning around and instantly claiming no, it was zee Clintons/DNC. Well played boys. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sounds about right. At this point I&#39;m thinking that Pizzagate was <em>shudder</em> cooked up by whoever purchased Podesta&#39;s stuff from whoever phished him (probably some Russian pro who got really lucky, or an American one). Three months with his emails before beginning to strategically deploy them two hours after Trump&#39;s pussy tape was released. Three months in order to make something big out of the contents. Pizzagate, complete with bogus/sourceless &quot;secret codes,&quot; fabricated evidence, misleading instagram pics and the like, was the final propaganda campaign of the election, unleashed just before (coincidentally or not) Comey&#39;s letter to congress got the mass Clinton criminality wave up and running again.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>And allows for the most potent reasonable doubt point of contention yet designed, as far as fighting against the hacking attribution claims. &quot;If Rich was the leaker the whole Russia narrative is destroyed! And the collusion narrative! And look, he was killed right after!&quot; Just waaaay too easy. </p>

<p>I&#39;m thinking, if all it takes to convince millions of Americans to believe a range of counter-conspiracies is killing one random DNC staffer who worked on tech stuff, that&#39;s a no-brainer for a spy agency recently suspected to conduct plenty of political killings, to say nothing of the KGB legacy. And assuming Russia was behind the extensive DNC hack, they would know exactly who to target. (their fuller attribution-pushback plan likely being the &quot;CIA can make anything look like a Russian hack&quot; concepts interpreted from the Vault 7 releases, which I&#39;m willing to believe they also knew about if they didn&#39;t attain them themselves, but once they were handed to Wikileaks). </p>

<p>Clearly Assange&#39;s &#39;interest&#39; in the &#39;case&#39; aligns with the Kremlin&#39;s interests... to sow confusion and distrust in the US population.</p>

<p>I mean, it&#39;s not <em>by accident</em> that Assange used the US diplomatic cables to benefit the Kremlin and its allies by, for example, delivering cables listing the names of pro-Democracy activists to the government of Belarus. </p>

<p>Or, you know, Assange hosting a talk show on Russian state-run news where he gave very soft-ball interviews to the likes of Hezbollah.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not quite sure how people can continue to say that Julian Assange is not allied with the Kremlin.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been trying to track down the original SVR reports but no luck so far. According to whatdoesitmean.com, they were originally in Russian (makes sense) so tracking down the originals might be tough. I have found lots of mentions and quotes from the SVR reports in comment sections on various right-wing news sites around the web.</p>

<p>What I do know is whatdoesitmean.com seems to always get these SVR reports first, which means either they are being written by the owner of whatdoesitmean.com, or he/she is the primary source of distribution for the person producing them.</p>

The deliberate anonymity/ID obfuscation of the author does stand out in an era where such sites feature scribes proud to sell themselves as public figures, with the notable exception (deliberate and also fishy) of Zerohedge. All look-up attempts can&#39;t get past privacy settings the URL has employed. A good deal of trouble to hide one&#39;s identity.

<p><strong>Whatdoesitmean.com reports: Prime Minister Hasina testified to the FBI and the US Justice Department, this report explains, that in 2011 then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called her office demanding that Muhammad Yunus be restored to his role as chairman of the Bangladesh’s most famous microcredit bank, Grameen Bank—but who had been paid between $100,000 and $250,000 to the Clinton Global Initiative, with Yunus himself personally giving between $25,000 and $50,000 to the Clinton Foundation website too.</strong>  </p>

<p>Read the full article, I&#39;d bet dollars to donuts this new &quot;angle&quot; is going to start being pushed hard by all the &quot;usual suspects&quot; in the next few days.

    <div class="md"><p>Every story on whatdoesitmean.com says that it is from Russian sources. Every story on whatdoesitmean.com is fake.</p>

<p>The author of whatdoesitmean.com <em>purposely</em> gives you plenty of clues that the stories are fake, if you pay the slightest bit of attention.</p>

<p>Take a look at <a href="http://www.whatdoesitmean.com/index2071.htm">the Seth Rich story on whatdoesitmean.com</a>, which follows the same template as other stories there. The first sentence on the page is &quot;World&#39;s Largest English Language News Service with Over 500 Articles Updated Daily&quot;, whis is obviously false. The story is credited to &quot;Sorcha Faal&quot;. More on this later.</p>

<p>The first sentence of the story includes the phrase &quot;report circulating in the Kremlin today&quot;. This signals to the reader that what follows is bullshit. The author includes that phrase on purpose to make it clear that it&#39;s fake. It&#39;s especially helpful when the stories are posted on other web sites, sometimes without the &quot;Sorcha Faal&quot; byline.</p>

<p>After the story, the web page includes this paragraph:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[Many governments and their intelligence services actively campaign against the information found in these reports so as not to alarm their citizens about the many catastrophic Earth changes and events to come, a stance that the <a href="http://www.whatdoesitmean.com/index7381.htm">Sisters of Sorcha Faal</a> strongly disagree with in believing that it is every human beings right to know the truth. Due to our missions conflicts with that of those governments, the responses of their ‘agents’ has been a <a href="https://theintercept.com/2014/02/24/jtrig-manipulation/">longstanding misinformation/misdirection campaign designed to discredit us, and others like us,</a> that is exampled in numerous places, including <a href="http://www.whatdoesitmean.com/indexsf33778855.htm">HERE</a>.]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The links show (1) &quot;Sorcha Faal&quot; is a fake name of an imaginary 2,600 year-old order of &quot;Sisters&quot;, (2) you are being manipulated by propaganda, and (3) a copy of the now-deleted Wikipedia page stating &quot;Sorcha Faal is the pseudonym of a self-described conspiracy theory author. Faal combines current news events with storytelling techniques, focusing on an anti-United States government, anti-war movement viewpoint opposing censorship in the U.S. and mass surveillance in the U.S.&quot;</p>

<p>The author of whatdoesitmean.com included that in case you missed all the other clues that this is fake.</p>
