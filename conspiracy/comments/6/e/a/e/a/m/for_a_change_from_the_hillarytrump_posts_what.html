    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>CO2 is not a problem. It doesn&#39;t change temperatures</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Totally FALSE. Educate yourself: </p>

<p>Although CO2 makes up only 0.04 percent of the atmosphere, that small number says nothing about its significance in climate dynamics. Even at that low concentration, CO2 absorbs infrared radiation and acts as a greenhouse gas, as physicist John Tyndall demonstrated in 1859. The chemist Svante Arrhenius went further in 1896 by estimating the impact of CO2 on the climate; after painstaking hand calculations he concluded that doubling its concentration might cause almost 6 degrees Celsius of warming—an answer not much out of line with recent, far more rigorous computations.
Contrary to the contrarians, human activity is by far the largest contributor to the observed increase in atmospheric CO2. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, anthropogenic CO2 amounts to about 30 billion tons annually—more than 130 times as much as volcanoes produce. True, 95 percent of the releases of CO2 to the atmosphere are natural, but natural processes such as plant growth and absorption into the oceans pull the gas back out of the atmosphere and almost precisely offset them, leaving the human additions as a net surplus. Moreover, several sets of experimental measurements, including analyses of the shifting ratio of carbon isotopes in the air, further confirm that fossil-fuel burning and deforestation are the primary reasons that CO2 levels have risen 35 percent since 1832, from 284 parts per million (ppm) to 388 ppm—a remarkable jump to the highest levels seen in millions of years.
Contrarians frequently object that water vapor, not CO2, is the most abundant and powerful greenhouse gas; they insist that climate scientists routinely leave it out of their models. The latter is simply untrue: from Arrhenius on, climatologists have incorporated water vapor into their models. In fact, water vapor is why rising CO2 has such a big effect on climate. CO2 absorbs some wavelengths of infrared that water does not so it independently adds heat to the atmosphere. As the temperature rises, more water vapor enters the atmosphere and multiplies CO2&#39;s greenhouse effect; the IPCC notes that water vapor (pdf) may “approximately double the increase in the greenhouse effect due to the added CO2 alone.”
Nevertheless, within this dynamic, the CO2 remains the main driver (what climatologists call a &quot;forcing&quot;) of the greenhouse effect. As NASA climatologist Gavin Schmidt has explained, water vapor enters and leaves the atmosphere much more quickly than CO2, and tends to preserve a fairly constant level of relative humidity, which caps off its greenhouse effect. Climatologists therefore categorize water vapor as a feedback rather than a forcing factor. (Contrarians who don&#39;t see water vapor in climate models are looking for it in the wrong place.)
Because of CO2&#39;s inescapable greenhouse effect, contrarians holding out for a natural explanation for current global warming need to explain why, in their scenarios, CO2 is not compounding the problem.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t really doubt climate change, but feel that its effects have been over exaggerated for political gain. Have you watched any of Corbett&#39;s videos on the topic? He points out deliberate doctoring of the data, bullying people whose results don&#39;t align with &quot;mainstream&quot; views, etc. I can link it to you if you wish.</p>

<p>My problem is the increasing amount of cherry picking among mainstream scientists. This issue is especially prevalent in the Pharmaceutical industry where researchers cherry pick positive results and throw out less desirable results. Science is a wonderful system but it has been dominated by corporate influence and plain old hubris. </p>

The planet is warming but the claims made by the global-warming-catastrophe crowd are not supported by the science.  </p>

<p>The first &#39;wiff&#39; is that they picked +2.0 C° as the critical threshold.<br/>
When does anything in science end up a round number?<br/>
And what is it&#39;s tolerance? It&#39;s not +2.0 C° +/- 0.<br/>
Digging into this you learn that warming due to CO2 is logarithmic and in the geological past the CO2 concentration was 4,000 ~ 5,000 and the planet was a Gaia. The narrative counters that the Sun was younger and fainter then but that leads to the Faint Young Sun Paradox. If I have to pick two winners out of the three-way contest then I pick geology and physics over climatology.  </p>

<p>This leads you to the question, what is the ideal CO2 concentration?<br/>
The first science-backed answer is that plants thrive with higher CO2 concentrations up to about 1,200 ppm. So that&#39;s the first target that makes any sense.  </p>

<p>The sea is rising at a nearly perfectly linear rate (R²=0.98) of 3.4mm/yr +/- 0.4mm. It will take something preposterous like 4,000 years for the sea to wash over Manhattan.<br/>
There is a lot of concern about ice-melt from Greenland rapidly rising the sea yet with the melt surge there we didn&#39;t see a corresponding change in the rate of sea-rise.  </p>

<p>Climatology is the only field where models are given more credence than direct observations. All the major models over-predicted warming for the past couple of decades. All of the dooms-day predictions were predicated on an exponential increase of CO2 concentration and it&#39;s actually growing at slightly more than a linear rate.  </p>

<p>Funding is politicized so they can&#39;t ask for funds to study anything contrary to the narrative. e.g. The Australian Outback is greening and the only reason we know is because an astronaut took a picture of it.  </p>

<p>The left, in this case specifically Cultural Marxist, are fanning the flames-of and trying to ride the coattails of the global-warming-catastrophe-hysteria to advance their global agenda. It does not matter to them if it true or not; all that matters is people are made anxious enough it to capitulate more rights to their centralized authority (and in this case it means the establishment of a global government).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the 2 degree thing is for the politicians. its a target to keep below rather than an exact point where everything will suddenly go up in flames. 
They are not worried about the ice melt from greenland effecting the sea level as much as they are worried about it affecting the north Atlantic current. Although I would be interested to hear any theories you have on that.
Im not sure what the greening of the australian outback has to do with it. It had a lot of rain in 2010-11 so more plants grew. Lots of places are increasing their forest cover including most of europe, china and parts of america. Plants grow better with more heat and more co2. the places that are losing forests are the poorer countries where they have no options but to cut the trees down to make a living.  </p>

<p>As long as the oil money is still flowing and the masses are idiots, free energy can continue to be suppressed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It all has to do with money.  The people profiting off fossil fuels have so much influence in government and politics, they can do anything they want.  Their opposition is limited by what they allow.  Certain patents are automatically denied.  Solar panels are only about 20% efficient but a few tweaks could result in 200% efficiency.  Also since this is a conspiracy subreddit... The NWO is the goal of certain people(GLOBAL warming).  These people will do anything and everything to keep free energy suppressed. Imagine a world without ugly powerlines, smog, gas pumps, power outages, highways...  It is what we were supposed to have but the wants of a few outweighed the needs of the many. 
More conspiracy: Global warming is how the mark of the beast will be introduced.  </p>
