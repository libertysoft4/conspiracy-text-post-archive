    <div class="md"><p>And all of this <strong>&quot;If you disagree you&#39;re instantly labeled a shill!&quot;</strong> talk. </p>

<p>I just want to touch upon this really quickly - I&#39;s not a valid defense excuse anymore. It never was. </p>

<p>Before this past election, this subreddit WAS able to have civil discourse and people could have different opinions. No one was called a shill because it was <strong>organic</strong>. Ever since this past election and the PROOF of shill accounts, it has become nearly impossible to differentiate between organic differences and &quot;I was paid to say this&quot; differences. </p>

<p>So, you can thank the people who want to control online discussion for causing everyone to call each other shills - because that&#39;s what Reddit is filled with now. </p>

<p>If not, he&#39;s a very talented and convincing actor, much like Alex Jones, keeps his cool when he needs to, knows how to garner support and trust from &quot;every-folk&quot;. Sociopath or not, that takes talent.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>all you have to do is start taking notes on the various facts he drops, in particular any names. put those names on a list, and learn the wikipedia page, etc of each person. once you know the background on each person, you don&#39;t need a guy like George Webb to tell you what to think, because it becomes self-evident by your own background knowledge of the people involved </p>

<p>? what is #0p6d #0p4c #0p64s ?</p>

<p>. #0p6dCP operation 6 degrees, named after 6 degrees of separation. </p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_degrees_of_separation">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_degrees_of_separation</a></p>

<p>mission is to make a long list of names, assume that a social network exists, and discover all the connections between each person on the social network, and to find the paths of fewest jumps to get from one node to another, (in the case of a distributed network), or each node to the top, in the case of a hierarchical network (such as President of the United States and the Executive branch) </p>

<p>perhaps make a new folder on your desktop for each name, and add info such as their photo, screen shot of their wikipedia page, screen shots of reddit comments, screen shots of blogs, youtube videos, etc. to your folder </p>

<p>spelled #0p6dCP prefix, root, suffix</p>

<p>prefix: starts with hashtag zero p for &quot;Op&quot; or &quot;Operation&quot; or &quot;Opposition&quot; etc </p>

<p>(pound sign &quot;#&quot; and/or leading zero &quot;0&quot; helps float this 0p to the top by alphabetical sort) </p>

<p>root: 6d is 6 degrees</p>

<p>suffix: CP is Child Prostitution/ Child Pornography </p>

<h1>0p4cCp Operation 4 colors, named after 4 color theorem</h1>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_color_theorem">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_color_theorem</a></p>

<p>mission of Operation 4 colors is to tag each name from Operation 6 Degrees with the <em>best keywords</em>, and the <em>best number</em> of keywords. problem: how many hashtags is the best number of hashtags? too few, can&#39;t find anything anywhere, too many, will find everything everywhere. </p>

<p>my personal opinion is that the best number of hashtags is somewhere between 4 and 7, for each of &quot;who, what, where, why, why, how&quot;</p>

<p>. #0p64sCP Operation 64 Squares named after a chess board</p>

<p>mission of Operation 64 Squares is to arrange photographs of all of the faces of the names from Operation 6 Degrees and Operation 4 Colors onto a chess board, starting with the President-Kingpin in the Top Left corner, and VP next box to the right, etc. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So called &quot;Left&quot; and &quot;Right&quot; seem to use different ways for propaganda as they also target groups which are wired differently from a psychological perspective.</p>

<p>The observation that the so called &quot;Left&quot; operates a lot with personal attacks, innuendo, PC and social/psychological ostracism looks quite accurate to me because a lot of the <em>stupid</em> &quot;Left&quot; seem to have a narcissist disorder and see themselves as &quot;better&quot; and more intelligent/enlightened human beings.</p>

<p>The so called &quot;Right&quot; seems to work differently and tries to use the base instincts(greed, fear, tribalism, ...) or cultural program(religion, culture) of people or make the opposite to feel weak by ignoring them. They also use more direct threats.</p>

<p>About Bernie Sanders, he obviously targeted the more intellectual/rational Left side who needed to be convinced by an argument (at least on the surface). But then again Bernie Sander&#39;s &quot;Elder Statement&quot; act was never really convincing to me either as he completely lacked the leader personality to succeed. He has a weak personality IMHO and he is surely smart enough to know his limitations so I consider his whole run phoney. The end was quite revealing.</p>

<p>I&#39;m pretty sure there are a lot people out there who looked into this complex far more deeper than the few mins I spent on writing this:-)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s silly the way they talk about stuff on the news. And the issues they choose from the BIGger issues and they always seem to direct u in different direction so you think about something else.To keep your focus away from the main subject? I know I can&#39;t be the only one that feels that way when watching any news..? or listening even? Js..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re absolutely right.  Sensationalism, misdirection, a skewed focus on violence and the negative.  These are the tools that the mainstream media use to simultaneously create a climate of fear and to keep people averting their eyes from the big picture.  I mean how often on the news do we hear about a community that came together today to solve a problem or better each other?  Those kinds of things happen every day.  But the focus is on almost nothing other than death and violence:  war and terrorism abroad, domestic terrorism and police brutality in the country, rape and murder in the communities.  This kind of skewed narrative has real power to shape and program people if they keep letting themselves be infected by it (watching TV).  The human spirit is never given the chance to be empowered by what we see on the news.  The mainstream media is the <em>real</em> Fake News. </p>

<p>&quot;Just look at us. Everything is backwards, everything is upside down. Doctors destroy health, lawyers destroy justice, psychiatrists destroy minds, scientists destroy truth, major media destroys information, religions destroy spirituality and governments destroy freedom.&quot;</p>

With Seth they&#39;re happy to admit he was murdered, not robbed, yet they don&#39;t take the next obvious step, why was he murdered and who benefited. Same with the emails, it was all about who leaked and why, but nobody wants to talk about the content of the emails and what they mean. Everybody follow this distraction over here, do not look at the elephant in the room</p>

<p>A month or two ago he moved onto the Awan brothers and I feel he&#39;s the one that got the D.C. Police to start investigating them because before Webb started discussing them nothing was happening and that&#39;s why they fled to Pakistan. </p>

<p>Cernovich was the one who broke the &quot;Susan Rice was the official in the Obama Administration who ordered the unmasking of US Persons identified in foreign intelligence&quot; story, that the NYT and WaPo had been sitting on for weeks without publishing. He actually does have sources inside the Administration who feed him news from time to time.</p>

<p>Full disclosure: I like Cernovich.</p>

<p>Can&#39;t speak to Roger Stone or George Webb, although my impression of Webb from his videos leads me to believe he&#39;s full of shit. Roger Stone...eh. I tend to believe Infowars is a &quot;poison the well&quot; operation and that Alex Jones is a psyop, but who would listen? He has only the amount of credibility required to distract people open to conspiracy theories.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t fucking buy it. </p>

<p>If this guy was as intelligent as some here seem to think he is, if his work is really as important as people are saying, he&#39;d be capable of putting out a &lt;1hr. long video summarizing his findings. Instead, I guess we need to parse through hundreds upon hundreds of videos to figure this dude out, with quite a few of the videos being absolute irrelevant trash (from my own research.)</p>

<p>I&#39;ve tried to watch George Webb because people cite him as being at the forefront of the Seth Rich thing. But every time I turn him on I get the feeling I&#39;m wasting my time....every single video seems like it needs way more context to understand and I shouldn&#39;t have to watch this motherfucker&#39;s entire YouTube videography just to understand what he&#39;s saying. </p>

<p>Fuck that.</p>

<p>What? This is not true at all. Webb has been doing this for literally 219 days. I&#39;m pretty sure it started with the news that Eric Braverman was missing and I <strong>definitely</strong> saw posts here discussing his early investigations in that area. I was here in this sub 220 days ago, but were you? The new account you&#39;re using is only 15 days old. </p>

<p>But yeah, George Webb has been all over the alternative media, too, for example, he did an hour long show with Tim Black on his progressive news YouTube channel. I&#39;ve known about him after hearing about him on Reddit early in his investigation, but I didn&#39;t pay much attention to Webb myself until I saw that interview. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is interesting. When he first started posting videos about Dyncorp human trafficking and organ harvesting from Haiti to Syria, which seemed to evolve out of pizzagate connections to CGI, I thought that what he posted was genuine evidence, government documents, and even mainstream news reports. He seemed to be making a good effort and doing good journalism, even referring to Seymore Hirsch a lot. So I didn&#39;t see any reason to doubt him, but I did start to have this lingering suspicious in the back of my mind that he was in some way connected to Mossad. </p>

<p>I haven&#39;t watched any of his recent stuff, but just what you said seems to confirm that even more. But that would actually be a good thing if it&#39;s true. It would mean people on the inside of these powerful organizations are working to stop corruption and make the organizations better, like they should be. So if that&#39;s the case, even if he does have ties to Mossad, it isn&#39;t a reason to disregard his work. </p>

<p>Just pop two bullets in the back of the head in a place where you own the coroner, and have it ruled a suicide like a normal assassination.  </p>

<p>Why log into a twitter account and write a tweet from him?<br/>

<p>The working theory is that Braverman is not expendable like Rich. It&#39;s probable that his brother is Israeli intelligence, and for all we know there&#39;s a deadman switch out there that could unleash all of the dirt on the Clinton foundation--he did go to the Russian consulate and try to escape, after all... this is in addition to trying to drop off the info with Wikileaks members who end up dying in this timeframe. </p>

<p>So, Webb speculates that he&#39;s in Israel right now--alive, but on a short leash. As to why Google is involved, they&#39;re practically an intelligence wing unto themselves. It would not surprise me for them to help the Clintons and do a solid on this one. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m here all of the time and I am critical of conspiracies.  </p>

<p>Mostly I am critical because I know that when I go to and start to talk about this stuff that people will have questions for me.  So I try to find all of the weaknesses in the story before I go telling it to other people.  </p>

<p>If I were to just respond to the guys at work with &quot;you are always denying what I&#39;m telling you&quot; and pouted my lips, I&#39;d get laughed at.  </p>

<p>Asking the questions, demanding better answers creates a system where the truth becomes bolder and bolder.  It becomes tempered over time.  </p>

<p>So do not drive away the deniers.  This sub needs them in order to make sure that the holes in our investigations are explored.</p>

Just watching one video won&#39;t get you anywhere he&#39;s been doing this for 219 days, so of course watching one video is going to seem confusing and like he&#39;s rambling but he&#39;s been building for weeks to this one day. Also I&#39;m not calling anyone shills or saying it&#39;s disinfo. I&#39;m simply saying look at what he&#39;s saying and talk about that not say that he&#39;s some schizo rambling on.

<p>All of the people you&#39;ve mentioned have had criticisms levied against them for quite a while, but when they make themselves more visible those attacks become more visible.  Webb has stayed off of the radar of most people, at least compared to KDC and JA, and the general lack of attention means detractors were fewer in number.  But with this more recent claim by Webb, visibility has gone up and therefore you&#39;ll see more people unsure of whether or not they&#39;re untrustworthy.</p>

Do you expect complete support for that? I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s necessarily true in this instance, but here on r/conspiracy people upvote click bait bullshit to the front page all the time. I don&#39;t doubt that their are some nefarious things going on, but the second there&#39;s any dissent to the ideas on this sub people immediately start calling out shills and share blue like no one has any legitimate reasons to question something. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just don&#39;t understand how certain users are closed off to the thought of looking him and what he says.  Now I can understand the sentiment, but it goes completely against the investigative nature of theorizing criminal conspiracies. We have much to lose by blindly following Webb. We lose nothing by questioning things and figuring out if he&#39;s a good guy. If however he&#39;s wrong and we go with it, at best it&#39;ll be used to discredit investigators, and <strong>at worst</strong>, he&#39;ll lead us off into a direction that obstructs justice from being served for the murderer of Seth Rich.</p>

<p>OP&#39;s post was written poorly, and he brought up two relatively low significance points(that I&#39;m not hearing often), while making no mention of specific research related criticism, with just massive one being mentioned. Like he belives his <em>admitted</em> ties to Mossad shouldn&#39;t be questioned because it&#39;s something only a shill would do. At the moment Geroge Webb is in the same league as Alex Jones for me. Some truths (say 80% to 90% true) mixed in with deviations (10% to 20%) and character quirks where it most matters. Even the chans are in agreement that Webb should be taken with a grain of salt. I enjoyed this measured post that was on the frontpage: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6e825u/george_webb_has_figure_out_who_killed_seth_rich/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6e825u/george_webb_has_figure_out_who_killed_seth_rich/</a></p>

When people asked for this information, they were told to go and watch his videos, starting at 219.1. When people noted that he was making logical leaps, they were told to go and watch his earlier videos. </p>

<p>It&#39;s been several hours since I was on that thread, but I&#39;ve yet to see a clearly written out thesis with supporting evidence. Sure, some people are trying to discredit him just to take heat off of the DNC and associated actors. I get that. </p>

<p>But some of us are looking to see what it is he&#39;s actually claiming and what evidence he has to back it up. I know <a href="/r/truthleaks">/r/truthleaks</a> was doing some summarization and outlining of his points, but is there a writeup with links that explains his thinking behind these latest claims?</p>

<p>still skeptical. Nothing personal. I dont trust anybody.</p>

<p>either way hes a talented and intelligent guy.</p>

<p>If hes honestly a self funded investigator with connections like he claims, all this free time, no work hours lol, hasn&#39;t been assassinated yet, then he is a brilliant investigator and deserves my respect for awakening the masss. I would love to believe this.</p>

<p>If not, he&#39;s a very talented and convincing actor, much like Alex Jones, keeps his cool when he needs to, knows how to garner support and trust from &quot;every-folk&quot;. Sociopath or not, that takes talent.</p>

<p>I Would NOT just yet take his word as the gospel. stay skeptical of him too.</p>

<p>There was a time when I thought AJ was the most real human being ever. now I know better. I grew up and I learned.</p>

<p>He&#39;s a member of intelligence, yo.</p>

<p>I feel like I&#39;m a broken record with this, but it&#39;s news that just came out and casts a whole different light on who he is. </p>

<p>At this point I find it more interesting to assess <em>why</em> this information is being dispersed to the public, since I don&#39;t doubt Webb&#39;s veracity based on my own research into organ harvesting rings, the people he cites and associates himself with (Sibel Edmonds, for example), and what I&#39;ve studied about the Clinton family through Wikileaks and elsewhere. I get it if others aren&#39;t there with him, but it&#39;s a judgment call I&#39;m personally comfortable with making. </p>

Again, these are people obviously, obviously speaking in code. If they weren&#39;t talking about pedophilia, then what was it, and was it likely not something similarly repugnant?</p>

Even going as far as filing complaints to the NZ police when Comey arrived in NZ to try to have have him held accountable by New Zealand law for his unlawful behaviour against Kim and mega etc (lol fat chance right? but still funny and I give him credit for taking the time to do it formally)</p>

<p>What this means to me anyway is that this guy is at least capable of rambling about things he has no idea about as if they are factual and 100% real</p>

<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong, I want justice for Seth rich but I&#39;m not sure about this guy being credible for the movement.. Happy to be proven wrong as like I say, I haven&#39;t seen much of his stuff.</p>

<p>Sethrich.info is nice though. </p>

I&#39;m beginning to think the media will start siding with Trump if that&#39;s what it takes to sweep this under the rug. Some social media platforms have already ran some pro trump fluff pieces which is a vast departure from all the vitriol. The Russian narrative is evaporating. It&#39;s all misdirection to get us to close up shop and stop snooping around looking for clues.

    <div class="md"><p>It appears that most of what Webb &#39;discovered&#39; has been online since 13 July 2016, written 3 days after Rich was killed, and over 1 month before Assange revealed Seth Rich in the Netherlands interview.
 <a href="http://www.whatdoesitmean.com/index2071.htm">http://www.whatdoesitmean.com/index2071.htm</a></p>

<p>What is really weird is that most stories on this site are completely crazy, and every story is prefaced by &quot;A somber Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) report circulating in the Kremlin today ...&quot; or some variant with &quot;the Russian Foreign Ministry etc.&quot;  </p>

<p>Since every story comes from an unknown Russian report of one sort or another, most of them are bordering on crazy, why does this post appear to connect all the dots?   The key point here is that contrary to the public reports from not only the Washington Post, but also RT, the Russian Foreign Ministry, the Kremlin site, that a tit-for-tat expulsion of two Russian diplomats from the US, and two US diplomats being sent back from Moscow, at or around the 6-7 July 2016, being the fallout from a bizarre incident outside the US embassy in Moscow a month earlier on June 6, that the expulsion of the two Russians from DC was connected to Seth Rich.</p>

<p>The story says that Russian intelligence was monitoring traffic around the DNC and they detected a surge of activity between Seth Rich, the DNC and the Clinton Foundation, and they quickly realised  that Seth Rich was possibly being targeted for a hit.   It says that permission was obtained from the highest level to break cover and inform the State Department of the activity, and that Rich may be in danger.   But after doing so, the agents were surprised that the State Department simply expelled them from the US, saying that not to worry, the US will take care of it.  This then triggered the Russians to expel two US diplomats, one reportedly being the agent involved in the June 6 incident outside the Embassy in Moscow.</p>

<p>I have scoured the Russian web using Yandex looking at blogs, news sites and there was not even chatter about this unreported version of events.   The first time the Russian web even mentions Seth Rich was after Assange spoke in early August.</p>

<p>Its possible that someone invented this extra connection between the Russian diplomats, a secret report, and a warning to the State Department.   Everything else, including the DC shootout allegedly involving Aloah Jarroh on July 9, checks out.</p>

<p>So is Webb secretly behind the website?   Where is the evidence for the supposed warning to the State Department, as the reason for the diplomats&#39; expulsion.   Any why on a site that regularly predicts the end of the world, every other week?</p>

<p>I admit, I have no fucking clue.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re absolutely right.  Sensationalism, misdirection, a skewed focus on violence and the negative.  These are the tools that the mainstream media use to simultaneously create a climate of fear and to keep people averting their eyes from the big picture.  I mean how often on the news do we hear about a community that came together today to solve a problem or better each other?  Those kinds of things happen every day.  But the focus is on almost nothing other than death and violence:  war and terrorism abroad, domestic terrorism and police brutality in the country, rape and murder in the communities.  This kind of skewed narrative has real power to shape and program people if they keep letting themselves be infected by it (watching TV).  The human spirit is never given the chance to be empowered by what we see on the news.  The mainstream media is the <em>real</em> Fake News. </p>

<p>&quot;Just look at us. Everything is backwards, everything is upside down. Doctors destroy health, lawyers destroy justice, psychiatrists destroy minds, scientists destroy truth, major media destroys information, religions destroy spirituality and governments destroy freedom.&quot;</p>
