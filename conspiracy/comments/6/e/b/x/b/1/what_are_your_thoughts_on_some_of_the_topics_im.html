        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I don&#39;t have enough time to research theories as much as I would like. I just got around to watching JFK to 911, a LONG but GREAT watch. So I figured I would recruit some of your opinions/links on the following subjects.  </p>

<p>This <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/no-there-wasnt-an-advanced-civilization-12-000-years-ago/">Scientific American article</a> on Gram Hancock got my attention today. The title of the article seems to be arguing with some audience, but who? The only place I&#39;ve ever seen Hancock mentioned is here and Joe Rogan. I still haven&#39;t watched that JRE podcast yet though.</p>

<p>I check the news about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RF_resonant_cavity_thruster">EM Drive</a> every day, doesn&#39;t seem to yield much. Shouldn&#39;t this be on the conspiracy theory radar, as it points to the possibility of zero point energy and/or the government keeping tech from the public? I would link the latest news articles but they just repeat the same buzz words.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KIC_8462852">Tabby&#39;s Star.</a> I&#39;d like to find aliens, but with all this project blue beam talk lately it got me thinking, wouldn&#39;t this seem like a great alien discovery. It is only proved by the measurements of light dimming from telescopes you can&#39;t operate/inspect/verify and when it&#39;s proven there&#39;s no telling when they will get here. Infinite suspense/cooperation, they could get here today or 10,000 years from now. </p>

<p>Thanks for any constructive input.      </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is an interesting debate. Here&#39;s a <a href="https://grahamhancock.com/hancockg17/">recent article</a> from Graham. </p>

<p>In my opinion 12,000 years is a long ass time, but science is cocky enough to describe in exact details 13.7 billion years ago, so its whoever you want to believe really. My mind changes every time I read an opinion on the topic. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Control of Scientific American by some very big very conservative money has turned it into particularly virulent and political motivated propaganda.  And that happened at least 15 years ago and it went from a magazine my parents subscribed to one I once subscribed to I cancelled 10 years ago.  To political in a nasty way, promoting the ideas held dear by wealthy oligarchs about class distinctions based on race and class.  Along with some cleverly disguised anti-climate change and other issues.  </p>

<p>This dismissal of the idea that we had an earlier civilization is just another of the kind of unscientific articles that magazine now publishes.</p>
