        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>TLDR: George Webb has identified the Awan brothers and another Pakistani individual as responsible for the Seth Rich murder. Where he stops short is establishing the connection of the Awan Brotherhood to Mossad/Israeli Intelligence. 
Proof: <a href="https://archive.is/Srm6O">An article posted to a Pakistani Defence forum in <strong>2015</strong> showing the Awan&#39;s being investigated as Mossad agents</a></p>

<p>Why would Webb stop there? Is it perhaps because he has stated in the past that some of his sources are inside the Israeli intelligence community? Is it because he&#39;s joked in the past that he&#39;s on Mossad&#39;s side since he&#39;s Jewish? </p>

<hr/>

<p>First, the interview with Fbianon on May 16, 2017 posted on the Victurus Libertas site. The credibility of this site, as well as their independent communication channel within Fbianon outside of 4chan is established by <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_David_Steele">Robert David Steele</a>, a well respected ex-CIA operative who also communicates information to the author of this site. The Fbianon on the VL site correctly identified the source of the laptop hijacking intelligence back to Israel, before the news broke on the MSM. This guy is the real deal.</p>

<p>TOM asked:  The news is exploding that Trump shared intel with Russians from an “ally” in the middle east and the ally is very upset. This is in regards to an Isis plot regarding airplanes and laptops.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A:  The “ally” not being named is Israel, and they are mad as hell at Trump.  Israel is furious because they got caught with their pants down. Lets get to the point. Isis was created by Israel and the US to weaken Iran and topple Assad. Billions in profits at stake. Israel has developed the technology to remote control airlines via laptops. A false flag was being prepared. Trump discussed it with Russian officials,exposing the “plot” McMaster pitched, and now all hell has broken loose. Trump did a wonderful thing in my opinion.  We do not need anymore Isis false flags.<br/>
If Isis is eradicated, it will decrease CIA and DOD budgets, limit the amount of “support” Israel receives, and cause disruptions in the grand scheme to build a massive pipeline through Syria and ultimately cause the downfall of Iran and Russia. This is why “Isis” is being kept alive by the NWO. This is why such “bold” and “frightening” plots must be continually fed to the people. To justify larger budgets, and bigger hegemony.
Russia is actually our only hope, along with Trump, that this diabolical system can be broken, shattered, as JFK once said, into a thousand pieces and scattered to the wind.
The technology to remotely control and crash commercial airliners was developed by Unit 8200, the Israeli cyber command. Does any thinking person actually believe rag tag militants would have the know how and resources to develop this technology? Give me a break. While we are at it, you may want to see how close the Russian MetroJet 9268 was to Unit 8200 when it went down. Tensions between Israel and Russia continue to grow by the day. Putin knows every trick in the Israeli arsenal and he just happens to be a much better chess player than Netanyahu.</p>

<p>DONNA asked: Is there a statute of limitations on the Benghazi issue or the email issues involving HRC? If so, what is it?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A:  If immunity has been breeched, and this is a matter for legal minds,then technically, immunity can be withdrawn. Say Ms Mill’s lied, or Huma was granted immunity. Immunity is predicated on full and credible disclosure.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr/>

<p>GILLIAN asked: Is the FBI investigating the Awan brothers Democratic spy ring being laid out so masterfully by George Webb?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A:  I am unable to comment on this matter.</p>

<hr/>
</blockquote>

<p>CAROLINE asked: Was there more to Obama’s month-long trip to Tahiti than just a ‘vacation’? As there were rumors of drug trafficking and/or other corrupt negotiations.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A:  There will come a time when the acts of the former president will be under review, but the time is not now.  It is believed that a reopening and broadened investigation into both the Clinton Foundation and HRC may lead to multiple “smoking guns”. Things are fluid now with Comey gone and McCabe putting out fires daily.</p>

<hr/>
</blockquote>

<p>MICHELLE asked: How does FBI rank and file feel about Comey’s firing?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A:  In public, mixed feelings;  but privately, many of us are pleased. The rank and file feel like trained fight dogs waking up to the sound of gunfire and realizing they are muzzled. The agency has been politically weaponized.
Most of us know how hard the agency worked to dismantle the Hoover era political tradecraft and to see it alive and well is disheartening. If we were given a mandate to investigate DC in its entirety, you could see 70% of your politicians being indicted.The Rank and File want nothing more than to see Americans witness that nobody, no matter how powerful, is above the law. I felt Comey was a good guy, but now feel he was compromised and did a disservice to the nation on July 5th 2016.</p>

<hr/>
</blockquote>

<p>ANON asked: Has anything happened inside the FBI since Comey’s firing involving talks of knowing Comey’s involvement with the Clintons?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A:  Yes. There may be news regarding McCabe within months, if not sooner.  </p>

<hr/>
</blockquote>

<p>LAWNA asked: Is the FBI working on the mystery surrounding the deaths and disappearances of holistic health care professionals?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A:  We are aware of them. However, we have not been given a green light to move forward. This has everything to do with Obama era policies, but it’s a good question and the feeling among some of us is that we would not be surprised if there are connections between these deaths and disappearances and a concerted effort by the reigning health elites.  Understand that during the Obama era, we were instructed to avoid investigating anything that would harm his circle. Obama’s circle or Hillary’s circle to be exact.
I am no expert in the matter, but I understand close to 70 people in the holistic or alternative medical profession have ended up with strange and unexplained deaths or have vanished completely, under strange circumstances.It seems many of the deaths seem connected to either FDA or Big Pharma. I would personally be interested in data grazing this one.</p>

<hr/>
</blockquote>

<p>SHIFT FREQUENCY asked: How dangerous is Comey’s firing for Clinton?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A:  Very dangerous.  But, few are thinking it through. The real danger is if she is given partial immunity. if HRC is facing serious prison time, and she can reduce her sentence by playing ball, we expect this will be the most profound thing Trump can do to drain the swamp. HRC has the goods on Schumer, and McCain, Graham, Blumenthal, and so much more. Imagine the most powerful mafia Don snitching on 30 years of tangled and corrupt relationships. Then triple the effect. HRC could effectively put 200 people currently in power behind bars.  This may be Trump’s chess move, however he needs to get rid of Kushner right away. As I indicated, Kushner is playing in an occult sandbox and there are recordings of this HRC is fully aware.  It could get ugly.</p>

<p>GILLIAN asked: Which of the dominoes involved in the Clinton Foundation – pay-to-play, pedophile, drug-running, gun running, human trafficking, organ harvesting, money laundering (etc.) network is most likely to be the first to fall, if any at all?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A:  All of the above, plus, the Israeli lobby, when fully exposed, with show how the alphabets have been compromised by a foreign nation. I believe Steele indicated that our “truest ally” is actually our national extortionist, and it’s true.  Imagine the public’s reaction when they find 80% of our senators and congressmen are on the take, allowing espionage, extortion and pedophilia to become the norm. We have a saying around here. If something dirty comes up regarding a politician, we refer to it as “New Babylon“.</p>

<hr/>
</blockquote>

<p>Angie asksed:  Is anyone in the FBI concerned about or planning for a financial downfall?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A:  We expect some bubbles to burst in fall, as they usually do. But lets paint a picture of how the year may play out. Trump has done a good job getting the cattle market into China, but now you will see chicken from China in our supermarkets. Lets hope it has less lead than the toys from China.
On trade, we will see better deals. Trump has the business head to negotiate tougher deals, and its about time. However, the real unemployment rate is still very high, and not at all what the BLS says it is.  Labor participation is a danger, and housing is in a new bubble. 10% of our bridges and roads are in horrific shape, and the last 16 years has left America tattered. Nobody knows when black swans arrive, but they always do.<br/>
Perhaps the next crash will be a bond dislocation, like 1929-1941, or perhaps it will be today’s bogeyman, the trillions in derivatives waiting to implode. My guess is that it may be related to middle east issues. Right now, Saudis Israelis and Qutari’s want that pipeline built so they can crush Russia’s spine, weaken Iran and ultimately run Syria, much like we ran Iran until 1979. These are dangerous waters.<br/>
Russia has been in Syria since the late 1940’s, Assad is the rightful ruler of Syria. CIA and Israeli clandestine services created Isis. Saudis and Qutari’s funded it, Turkey brokered oil deals. The American people shake their head when told Iran is the biggest terrorist nation. That’s a false narrative. Saudi’s and Israeli’s are in cahoots together and many Americans are becoming aware of the charade and wonder why the media plays them day and night.</p>

<hr/>
</blockquote>

<p>James asked:  What is the main concern (meaning what is the biggest case) going on inside the FBI at this time?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A:  Israel. We are truly in danger of becoming the United States of Israel.  They own 80% of our politicians. They have infiltrated our media, our tech companies, our banking systems.  The average Jew in Israel or America is not a problem, they are regular people. But, the ones who either serve Zionism, or work on the so called “Greater Israel” manifest destiny pose a serious risk, both foreign and nationally.
If we can move forward with a full investigation into the CF, Wiener, and HRC, it will eventually lead to exposing the vast reach of the Israeli lobby. The best thing we can do as a nation is to continue to bring this stuff into the light. That’s why platforms like /Pol/ on 4chan, and so called “truth” channels provide the people with some kernel of truth.
Back in July, I tried to let people know that their mandate for taking back the nation had to begin with a citizen’s investigation into the CF.  Now, please investigate Israel, from Mossad, to AIPAC, to a huge and complex web of financial connections between Israel and our elected leaders. I promise you that you will find a slew of information if you look closely. And what you find will make you question how we can consider Israel or Saudi Arabia as allies.</p>

<p>Anon2 asked:  What about Seth Rich and his murder?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A:  Expect a flood of new info regarding this.<strong>It was a sloppy hit, and can lead directly to 3 senators, and John Brennan calling in a favor from some of his Mossad buddies.</strong> This I have heard from more than one source. There is a leaker within the DC police, and fireworks will come soon enough. Seth Rich passed on over 44k emails to Wikileaks. Why do you think the CIA is calling for JA’s head? Because they must silence any investigation into Rich’s  execution. Start with Schumer and McCain and see where the breadcrumbs lead.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have a somewhat high level of credibility on the T_D sub since I am the one who found Seth Rich&#39;s social media accounts and gmail address- people sometimes send me items to research and post because they know I can get them visibility. I posted this information there and it was rapidly rising for about 8 minutes and then boom, vanished. This has never happened to me before.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agree -  see my post history.  I have been following George Webb for since day 56.

    <div class="md"><p>Not at all discounting the work he has done, the scope of it is staggering and well laid out. But there&#39;s just one massive connection missing, and WHY does he stop just short of exploring the link between Awan and Israel? Everyone has their own motivations for getting to the bottom of this murder, what is his?</p>

<p>The thing that woke me up was seeing the massive MSM overreaction to Trump &quot;leaking intelligence to Russia about laptops that could hack planes.&quot; Most of us were thinking - so what??? If ISIS has that capability, ALL our allies that are fighting ISIS should know this. Fbianon&#39;s revelations above made it click for me.</p>

<p>You are so right.. political dalliances are bullshit right now. I see us as two sides- people who love America/western values and want to preserve what it was founded on, and people who want to destroy it.</p>
