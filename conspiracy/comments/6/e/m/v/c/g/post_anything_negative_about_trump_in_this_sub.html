<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TrumpInvestigation/wiki/doc">https://www.reddit.com/r/TrumpInvestigation/wiki/doc</a></p>

<p>You&#39;ve been appealed to,  quite purposefully,  by the Trump propaganda machine. Political advisors have seen the potential in tapping anti-establishment and conspiracy theory types for political gain. They&#39;ve made the movement mainstream, and gave them a voice in Donald Trump.</p>

<p>Although I&#39;m quite certain DJT has no interest in pursuing any of the &quot;lock her up&quot; rhetoric he spouts off. He understands the value in mainstreaming this type of voter,  something never done before. Ingenious, by him and his advisors really.</p>

<p>The government is no longer telling you not to look at the man behind the curtain. They&#39;re pointing to a curtain across the room,  lifting it up to show the ankles and saying investigate this man! </p>

<p>And everyone is doing what they ask because they feel enfranchised by a man that seemingly listens to them.</p>

<p>Trump can lock her up,  get any classified info on Seth Rich,  and on wire tapping,  and he knows what narratives he pushes. But he refuses to act,  not out of malice,  but out of any actual conviction or belief in the bullshit his administration pushes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why can&#39;t we discuss both like adults tho? I agree Seth rich was murdered by a humans and I don&#39;t know why, neither do you, and let&#39;s find out. I also think we should legitimately look at curropt actions by Trump and associates. Doesn&#39;t have to be a mute point because there isn&#39;t a smoking gun yet. Last I checked of there was solid evidence in the Seth rich investigation someone would be arrested. Either way I think both can be real issues. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why narrow it down to the dnc? Why not just say government officials are behind the Seth Rich case? I&#39;m sure this type of thing happens all of the time by both parties..... just like all of the other horrible things that have come up recently. By pinning it all to one party not only is ignorant but also dangerous. If any one party was guilty why wouldn&#39;t the other call it out? Maybe because it&#39;s just business as usual? </p>

<p>TLDR:. The dossier talks about a 19.5% oil deal.  A 19.5% oil deal went down with some very shady elements involved.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What I find funny is that no one gets uppity when you don&#39;t believe in Bigfoot, but if it is a partisan political conspiracy, it is an imperative that everyone believes RIGHT NOW and if you don&#39;t it is justification for the most petty types of attacks.
That is what makes this all the more suspicious. They are PERSONALLY insulting people for not wholeheartedly believing what ever articles they post, or even have a lingering doubt about their sources.
It all degenerates into whataboutisms and ad hominems.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump fans have been here all along. They&#39;re regulars here. It&#39;s unfortunate that they&#39;re partisan fools who want to cover up criticisms of our horrible president, but that doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re bots or shills or anything else. Were you here last year throughout the election? We&#39;ve NEVER been free of the Trump fans, I think they&#39;ve always had a  slight majority here. In fact, the only new thing around here is the heavy pro-Democrat vote manipulation and astroturfing. We had some Clinton shills during the election, but it was never like it is today. I&#39;ve been downvoted just for saying &quot;Clinton is corrupt&quot;. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you just going to ignore that the other 4 subpoenas that went out were for Russia connections?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The House Intelligence Committee on Wednesday issued seven new subpoenas in its investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.</p>

<p>Four of the subpoenas are related directly to Russian meddling, which is also also the subject of probes from the Senate Intelligence Committee and FBI.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s to bad people focus on the piss part of the dossier to try and discredit it, rather than focus on the things like Rosneft deal that matches up perfectly to unknown people(s).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This looks like a good breakdown of it all.  Don&#39;t get me wrong, it&#39;s not 100% verified, but many aspects of it are.</p>

<p><a href="https://thesternfacts.com/trump-russia-dossier-decoded-yes-there-really-was-a-massive-oil-deal-e33370349b67">https://thesternfacts.com/trump-russia-dossier-decoded-yes-there-really-was-a-massive-oil-deal-e33370349b67</a></p>

<p>TLDR:. The dossier talks about a 19.5% oil deal.  A 19.5% oil deal went down with some very shady elements involved.</p>

<p>People love to say she should be in jail, but I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever seen which law(s) she actually broke.  Can you link to something?</p>
