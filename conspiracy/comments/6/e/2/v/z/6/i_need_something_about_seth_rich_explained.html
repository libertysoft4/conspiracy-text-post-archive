<p>They had mentioned &quot;fake news&quot; and &quot;conspiracy theories&quot; in it and they also mentioned how they wait everyday for a phone call on who killed their son. </p>

<p>I am a parent and i just cant comprehend why they are against the idea that their son might of been a leaker? Why does it seem so offensive to them? Shouldnt their main priority be to find out why their son was killed and who did it? The whole thing just doesnt add up to me. If i were in his parents shoes i would be thankful and happy that other people are digging into my childs murder. </p>

<p>To me this has nothing to do with the right, left, etc. I think all parties are corrupt. </p>

<p>Seth Rich was a lifelong democrat that by all accounts was very passionate about his political beliefs. Knowing this as a parent, and having to watch a bunch of right-wing shitheads turn your son&#39;s murder into a baseless partisan attack against the very political party that your son held so dear must fill his parents with a sense of disgust that I doubt many of us could imagine.   </p>

<p>You&#39;re right, and most of them seem to naively believe it was Russia who supplied the leaks, despite a <a href="https://fighting15th.com/2017/05/15/russian-hackers/">dearth of evidence and numerous contradictions</a> with that narrative as well as the fact that the only evidence to date presented to the public regarding any sort of leaks with Russian involvement relate exclusively to Guccifer 2.0 and there are <a href="http://g-2.space/">numerous issues with the assertion that he is Russian in origin</a>.

    <div class="md"><p>Asserting that it&#39;s primarily a right-wing conspiracy theory results in there being only an arbitrary distinction in your statement between right wingers and those &quot;gullible enough to fall for their propaganda&quot; and is ignorant as well of the fact that the theory originated on the non-partisan DNCLeaks sub. It wasn&#39;t a strawman and saying it is doesn&#39;t make it so nor does it change the intent of your original statement to denigrate those who believe in it. You&#39;re propagating the idea that it&#39;s a right-wing theory and if you disagree on that point you&#39;re either an idiot or being intentionally disingenuous with your posts. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>What does this have to do with Russia</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because the entire media narrative focuses on the poorly supported assertion that it was Russia, not an insider,  which supplied the leaks to Wikileaks. Read my previous post. I said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Seth <strong><em>or another insider</em></strong> was the source of the DNCLeaks </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is one of these three options which were the source of the leaks. Russia as the source is poorly supported, there&#39;s no evidence of any kind of an alternate insider to Seth, and Wikileaks and Assange&#39;s numerous references to Seth Rich add credence to the idea that it was him. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>people are making up blatant lies </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You seem awfully certain that what corporate media is telling you is true is actually true. Maybe Seth wasn&#39;t the source, but you&#39;re <em>awfully sure</em> when you really have no reason to be. But go ahead and keep denigrating those who entertain the possibility, continue believing we&#39;re all being misled by Sean Hannity and his ilk when the Seth Rich theory predates all involvement of the right and &#39;alt-right&#39;. </p>

<p>References to Seth Rich =/= evidence Seth Rich was the leaker.  </p>

<p>I have no reason to believe he was the source. There is no evidence he had any kind of access to get the emails to begin with, no less any evidence of him leaking them. Every claim of real evidence has been debunked or walked back from the source. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s the actual timeline of the conspiracy.  </p>

<p>The first mention of it was a tweet trying to <a href="https://twitter.com/relombardo3/status/752697104003264514">tie the Rich murder with the DNC lawsuit</a>. That was posted less than 24 hours after the murder (with zero evidence btw). Two days later (July 13th) we see the right-wing media pushing their own version of the Seth Rich conspiracy via <a href="http://archive.is/RxXMb#selection-243.0-255.7">WhatDoesItMean.com</a> who ran a story claiming Rich was on his way to meet with the FBI about the Clinton Foundation when he was gunned down by a Clinton hit squad. <strong>Pretty telling that the first actual Seth Rich article pushing a conspiracy literally came from the Kremlin.</strong> </p>

<p>As to your post, no, authorities investigating it is NOT THE SAME as random vigilantes.

The (former) National Security advisor quits after appearing on the Kremlin-funded propaganda network, lies about working with the Russian ambassador, and visits the Russian military intelligence agency. Oh, and Trump&#39;s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, tries to set up a secret &quot;back-channel&quot; communication with the Kremlin- <em>before</em> Trump even wins the election.</p>

<p>For someone who supposedly isn&#39;t working with the Russians, Trump certainly seems to be working with the Russians.</p>

<p>By the way, installing a secret backchannel isn&#39;t diplomacy- it&#39;s hiding communications you don&#39;t want anyone else to see. It&#39;s funny how a conspiracy subreddit is suddenly fine with that sort of thing. Apparently you don&#39;t trust the government... until you do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean, wasn&#39;t that the entire point of hiring Rod Wheeler to investigate Seth Rich&#39;s murder? A real investigator looking into their son&#39;s murder? No sooner then Wheeler reports that Seth Rich was in contact with Wikileaks, and that DC Metro failed to thoroughly investigate the murder case then Brad Bauman stepped in as the spokesman for the Rich family. The same Brad Bauman with ties as a PR crisis manager for the DNC and ties to David Brock of CTR/Share blue notoriety.</p>

<p>For all we know, any statement made on the behalf of the Rich family at this point has been put in their mouths by the same people who are desperate to make this entire investigation go away. Rather than pitching in for the reward (over $500k now), helping investigators find the culprits who murdered their own employee and simultaneously exonerating themselves by helping to find the murderer(s) of Seth Rich, we instead see a steady stream of denials with appeals to decency. If the Rich family truly wanted to put the entire matter to rest, and was satisifed with the lack of answers from DC Metro, why hire Wheeler in the first place?</p>

<p>Is the family supposed to be grateful? And are they not supposed to deal with the fact that this guy put a shitstorm on their hands, and are being harassed?

<p>Speculation:</p>

<p>-FBI knows and sources did confirm to Wheeler that contact had been made.

<p>George Webb says the same thing. Explains the fingerprints on Seth Rich are the same as all previous Clinton victims like Vince Foster.

The good thing about this is you can analyze something from, say, 30 years ago and use that same analysis to something of suspicion today to get a lot of answers and leads.</p>
