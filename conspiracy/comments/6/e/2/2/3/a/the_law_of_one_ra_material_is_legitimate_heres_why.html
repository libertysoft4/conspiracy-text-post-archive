        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>If you&#39;ve heard of the <a href="http://lawofone.info">Law of One</a> you may have overlooked it because - well, it sounds nuts. A set of channelings from the 1980&#39;s from an extraterrestrial intelligence?</p>

<p>However in light of unified physics [i.e. <a href="/r/holofractal">/r/holofractal</a>, a holographic universe] things that seemed impossible or paranormal simply become supra-normal and physically possible.</p>

<p>One of those things is channeling or &#39;the muse&#39; or accessing non-local information. This is possible obviously because the electromagnetic information of the whole system is available at every point.</p>

<p>IMO, there are some explanations/claims in the material that simply seem downright too complex to have come up on a whim.</p>

<p>There is a passage wherein the questioners are asking about the great pyramid - talking about using the pyramid as a temple for initiation. Due to the pyramids configuration, it concentrates energy in certain areas.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>4.2 <em>Questioner:</em> Does the shape of the pyramid have effect upon the initiation?</p>

<p><em>Ra:</em> I am Ra. As we began the last session question, you have already recorded in your individual memory complex the first use of the shape having to do with the body complex initiation. The initiation of spirit was a more carefully designed type of initiation as regards the time/space ratios about which the entity to be initiated found itself.</p>

<p>If you will picture with me the side of the so-called pyramid shape and mentally imagine this triangle cut into four equal triangles, you will find the intersection of the triangle, which is at the first level on each of the four sides, forms a diamond in a plane which is horizontal. The middle of this plane is the appropriate place for the intersection of the energies streaming from the infinite dimensions and the mind/body/spirit complexes of various interwoven energy fields. Thus it was designed that the one to be initiated would, by mind, be able to perceive and then channel this, shall we say, gateway to intelligent infinity. This, then, was the second point of designing this specific shape.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now if you are anything like me you&#39;d simply take one side of the pyramid, divide it into triangles, and get your &#39;diamond&#39; which slices through the midlevel of the pyramid.</p>

<p>Like <a href="http://www.fractal-explorer.com/pictures/sierpinskiTri/SierpinskiTri1.jpg">this</a></p>

<p>Is there a diamond if each of the sides look like this? Kind of. It&#39;s more like a square slicing through the middle of the pyramid.</p>

<p>However, we need to solve the riddle a bit differently.</p>

<p>Ra gives us a subtle hint:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you will picture <em>with me</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>So - ra is a higher dimensional being outside of space and time. If we were to picture with him, we would see all sides of the great pyramid at once.</p>

<p>When you do this, and do the same solution - you get <a href="http://i.imgur.com/Acwn53v.gifv">this</a></p>

<p>The overlap and intersection of the triangles form a literal <em>diamond</em> inside of the pyramid. There is no better word that more easily conveys this information.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the crazy part. This diamond absolutely perfectly frames the Queen&#39;s Chamber.</p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/iGuL9OZ.png">Like this</a></p>

<p>This is the most satisfactory reasoning for the placement of the Queen&#39;s Chamber I&#39;ve personally ever seen.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure how you would go about forging this in the 80&#39;s, but Carla Rueckert [the channel] and her associates would have needed either some very hidden occult knowledge and simply plugged non
chalantly it into the Ra Material, which is 1/10,000th of the information contained in the material, or they were legitimately accessing some sort of non-local information whether it be an extraterrestrial intelligence or a sort of akashic record. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that this is legitimate, however, neither you nor anyone else can prove that these entities like Ra aren&#39;t malevolent. There&#39;s good reason to believe that these entities are byproducts of the Saturn matrix system itself and will lie about anything in any way so that you&#39;ll want to stay inside the matrix of your own free will.</p>

<p>&quot;There&#39;s a frequency change coming, things will get better.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You just have to raise your vibration.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Earth will ascend soon.&quot;</p>

<p>I&#39;ve listened to MANY channelers over the years and the messages are the same while the voices sound very similar: strange accent which is kinda pompous but in a veiled way, and very vague about what actions to take.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve dabbled in the occult and have set up several magic circles. I know how to speak with the goetia demonic entities (but they won&#39;t speak to me) and I don&#39;t see how channeling would contact something different other than demonic entities. This has nothing to do with religion by the way so don&#39;t take the word &quot;demon&quot; as Christian terminology. You can call them djinn, archonic forces or whatever you wish. They&#39;re not friendly aliens though IMO.</p>

<p>This idea that we are alone and the most advanced people in the universe - in its nigh infinite size - is ridiculous. You cannot prove that these beings are malevolent.

<p>They have not told us to give into fear. Nor have they told us to trust in them. You oversimplified their message to vilify them. They didn&#39;t say that they will save anyone, nor did they ask anyone to be complacent. They did the opposite. </p>

<p>Then explain why the elite and secret societies worship spiritual entities rather than aliens? Moloch, Baal, Lucifer, etc. They aren&#39;t being called or described as aliens. The New Age interpretation of what&#39;s going on is relatively recent and centered around galactic civilizations, space wars and alien councils trying to help planet earth. It just doesn&#39;t add up tbh. I understand neither view is entirely provable.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Well, I don&#39;t believe in outer space so I also don&#39;t believe in an infinite universe. It&#39;s only the cult of scientism that has pushed the idea that we&#39;re utterly alone in a universe which exploded from nothing and is so large that we can&#39;t comprehend it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You&#39;re just making faulty assumptions, such as assuming all channeled beings are one and the same or from the same groups. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not really. I&#39;ve been working on this for several years. If they were here to help they would have already, but we&#39;re still under the control of genocidal psychopaths. They also can&#39;t speak about Jesus Christ directly except to briefly mention he&#39;s just another ascended master, or that he&#39;s &quot;Master Jesus&quot;. It seems as though they deliberately avoid the topic and saying his name altogether.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do not know why they decide to do that, though if you look at gnostic teachings, these rituals are more about acquiring energy and manifestation than summonings. The deities themselves may also be alien elites of old, depending on whether or not you believe in the idea of ET&#39;s helping ancient civilizations. </p>

<p>Your second point is your belief. I won&#39;t argue against it or try to change your mind, but if you do operate on that assumption, then my point of view - from your point of view - can never be correct. </p>

<p>Its not up to them to help us; we must help ourselves. They have made that clear. They simply pushed us in the right direction by introducing/re-introducing (considering these are prevalent in gnostic Christianity and Buddhism and even Hinduism) positively-oriented gnostic concepts. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t see why that third concept is relevant. They don&#39;t need to hold Christ at an exalted position, making him a borderline deity. I am quite sure that he never intended to be viewed as the Son of God. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>I didn&#39;t say he had to be exalted. It&#39;s their issue of avoiding the topic and being unable to say &quot;Jesus Christ&quot; that concerns me. They can only say Jesus <em>the</em> Christ, but usually it&#39;s just Master Jesus. It matters for obvious reasons. How people and belief systems view the status of Jesus Christ and what he did is important. If they say he didn&#39;t exist and his story is just a myth that would be more acceptable than saying he did exist and was just part of an alien council.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Christ may refer to the Chrism (if I recall correctly, in Gnostic belief, this is the Sacred Secretion) itself. Jesus may have been his true name and Christ may refer to his consciousness.</p>

<p>I can never be sure of this. As for the alien council. Yeah its a trippy concept, but I suspect they mean that he was a starseed, who in his past life was on the Council. </p>

<p>Lots of evidence for demons, from exorcisms to &quot;sleep paralysis&quot; to &quot;schizophrenia&quot; (both are real medical conditions that are also used to describe demonic attacks).</p>

<p>Sleep paralysis isn&#39;t demonic in nature, so idk where you got that from. You can actually induce it by learning lucid dreaming IIRC. </p>

<p>Of course demons and aliens (well specific races) can be considered one and the same. </p>

<p>All matter is consciousness. It is a manifestation brought forth by consciousness and is a part of it. This consciousness is the Source or God, as you would call it. It is a part of us and everything in the universe and we are a part of it. All is One. One is All. </p>

<p>I know Bill Cooper (RIP). Project Bluebeam is certainly a concern. However, one man does not have all of the answers. The elite don&#39;t plan one step ahead, nor do their plans have one singular goal. They often try and kill as many birds with one stone as possible. With the advent of knowledge of Project Bluebeam, people have been using it to discredit ET based conspiracies far too often for me to think of it as coincidental, especially the more positively oriented ones such as the Law of One or Corey Goode&#39;s stuff. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Like I said, different groups, different ideas. Its like human existence. Many people are Podestas/Clintons/Rothschilds, others are more like Christs/Buddhas. Most are somewhere in between, though more towards positive polarity as opposed to negative polarities. </p>

<p>A Reptilian with orders to ensnare children won&#39;t be the same as a Blue Avian with orders to spread messages of self-love and service-to-others. You&#39;re assuming they are all negatively oriented; this is not the case. Like human societies, the societies of aliens differ and since these are separated by galaxies and solar systems, the differences are more pronounced. </p>

<p>Its demonic from your view. And indeed, they could be negative entities as opposed to a figment of your imagination. However, they could be extraterrestrial in origin, not necessarily from a dimension known as Hell. Moreover, sleep paralysis is related directly to lucid dreaming. <a href="https://www.nylon.com/articles/sleep-paralysis-lucid-dreaming">https://www.nylon.com/articles/sleep-paralysis-lucid-dreaming</a></p>

<p>I doubt it is demonic in origin. </p>

<p>I agree that this is legitimate, however, neither you nor anyone else can prove that these entities like Ra aren&#39;t malevolent. There&#39;s good reason to believe that these entities are byproducts of the Saturn matrix system itself and will lie about anything in any way so that you&#39;ll want to stay inside the matrix of your own free will.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This entity doesn&#39;t lie enough to make me think it&#39;s a Saturn matrix entity (demon). And it makes too many mistakes for me to consider it a true entity of the light (Holy angel).</p>

<p>For those reasons, I think it&#39;s made up by a well-meaning person who is trying to share the truth.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I know how to speak with the goetia demonic entities (but they won&#39;t speak to me) and I don&#39;t see how channeling would contact something different other than demonic entities.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is a major risk that the right hand path takes.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This has nothing to do with religion by the way so don&#39;t take the word &quot;demon&quot; as Christian terminology. You can call them djinn, archonic forces or whatever you wish.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Different cultures use different terms, but humanity has always known about evil entities like this. The problem is the mythology that has been created in some &quot;Christian&quot; circles about demons.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They&#39;re not friendly aliens though IMO.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Agree. It&#39;s possible some of these spiritual beings might use a craft (Ezekiel&#39;s vision), but I&#39;m much more inclined to think these are just apparitions of a spirit being.</p>
