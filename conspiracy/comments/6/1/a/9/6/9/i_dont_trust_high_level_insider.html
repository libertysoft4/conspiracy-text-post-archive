<p>One thing that got me was this: &quot;We let your politicians run drugs and have orgies with children because they have a functioning methodology of governance and you don&#39;t.&quot; </p>

<p>The pronoun &quot;we&quot; give me a strong impression the HLI sees himself/herself as special and distinct, &quot;you&quot; and &quot;your&quot; diffuses responsibility of HLI, and &quot;they&quot; turns politicians into the &quot;other&quot; and a common enemy, siding us with HLI. </p>

<p>Oh, and HLI&#39;s group sees trafficking and child rape as essential functioning methodology. </p>

<p>Sounds like CIA goatfuck. </p>

<p>Alot of the juicy stuff seems like it is meant to captivate, rather than educate. The space-elevator, for example, is distracting. Saying 9/11 is an inside job is so wide-spread a belief that HLI deserves no credit for it, but people see that and become captivated by a feeling of affirmed shared knowledge with a higher authority. </p>

<p>Thoughts? </p>

<p>The one that really gets me is: &quot;no aliens.&quot; And that&#39;s it. No more on the subject. </p>

<p>Why is that? There are projects that could push double-digit GDP growth, but we choose not to do them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The space elevator is a cool idea, I totally agree. It would be great to build one of these. What I find suspicious is that the space elevator is the type of thing few layman understand, but most laymen find amazing. The idea is awe-inspiring. It&#39;s like sleight-of-hand. We are all very impressed. Just my two cents. </p>

<p>In the grand scheme of the universe, I find it impossible to believe there are not other life forms. Perhaps HLI meant &quot;no aliens&quot; have visited earth yet, in the typical way we have imagined it. All the current theories are wrong, etc. </p>

<p>The Edgar Mitchell/Podesta emails have some interesting mentions. </p>

<p>The pyramids being arranged in the shape of constellations in space, I think, is very interesting. There seems to be something about the Pleiades.</p>

<p>&quot;No aliens&quot; seems like too swift a dismissal. </p>

<p>My point is that the cool stuff might be real but it might also be a limited-hangout. </p>

<p><em>This sort of question (even posed much moderately than the opening) will only illicit blank stares from the masses. They have no idea how to do better than what they are given, so no impetus to challenge the regime even though they are dissatisfied with it.</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Legalize all the drugs. Delete the social welfare system and replace it with basic income. Host a conference for Abrahamic religions. Build nuclear power plants like they have in France, but all over the world and Antarctica. Global mass transit, especially in America to reduce numbers of cars. Create ocean sanctuaries to replenish wildlife. Study the trash island In the pacific and work on ways to eliminate it. Develop oceanic permaculture and terrestrial food forests. End the use of fungicides and pesticides to save the bees. Reduce monoculture in favor of permaculture. Introduce gardening into the education system. Introduce car-repair and maintenance into education, expecially America. </p>

<p>And of course, build a space elevator. </p>

<p>Yes, but he also explains that the regime is incompetent and has no better ideas how to keep the dollar afloat, for example. He does not approve of it, as far as I recall.</p>

<p>The space-elevator is definitely a very cool idea. There is nothing wrong with that but it seems cherry-picked for its cool-factor, like sleight-of-hand. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You make a lot of good points on this thread so I give you credit for that. And I think you&#39;re one of the few who has read every word. I will give HLI more consideration.</p>

<p>I like that HLI has a positive, almost utopian message. This is what I think makes it slightly suspicious, like we should all relax and ignore the bad stuff. That&#39;s what I mean by limited-hangout related to the space elevator. The elevator itself is not the hangout; it is part of the utopia HLI wants us to imagine. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I read through every single one of his threads - i don&#39;t ever recall him putting any degree of justification to the human trafficking or pederasty - if you can point it out where you saw that, I would like to read that.  I don&#39;t think he was justifying it; I think he was answering a question and confirming that this level of blackmail exists.</p>

<p>And in terms of aliens: there hasn&#39;t ever been any evidence shared with the public to determine that we have ever been in contact by/with aliens.  It makes logical sense that there is ET life - but it wouldn&#39;t shock me to find out if there hasn&#39;t been contact yet.</p>

<p>If I was going to pick out some more shocking things he has said, i would mention his claim that Obama is Osama, or his claim that we should only really be eating once per day, for example.</p>

<p>Feel free to check the threads for yourself. If I remember well, High Level Insider responded this, when asked about his group &quot;Three&quot; and about their goals:</p>

<p><em>We are splinter group of the mystery schools that is about 3000 years old.</em></p>

<p><em>The big picture is, very roughly, that consciousness was loss in catastrophic events in the past. Evidence of civilization remained, consciousness was regained, people realized that it existed before and was lost. Mystery schools form to try to protect against that happening again but are eventually corrupted by ideas like the need for masters and slaves, therefore justifying an effort to keep most people unenlightened, unconscious, downtrodden. We&#39;re a splinter group opposed to that and seek the highest elevation of each individual.</em></p>

<p><a href="https://archive.4plebs.org/pol/thread/115167267/#q115172800">Because</a>:</p>

<p><em>Trump isn&#39;t the real threat to the deep state. We are.</em></p>

<p><em>To the extent that Trump aligns himself with doing good, he can&#39;t be stopped. If he gives himself over to the past, he will be the agent of his own demise.</em></p>

<p><em>The way society is set up right now, it doesn&#39;t function without the deep state. The fact that your supermarkets are stocked is dependent on massive drug running and a variety of other things that manage the global currency system and so on. Trump can&#39;t root out corruption without starving the people UNLESS he shifts to seeing the bigger picture and embarks on systemic reform.</em></p>

<p><em>That is why big ticket items like the space elevator are absolutely necessary and any discussion significantly removed from this sort of scope is pointless. You can shift the drug/petrodollar regime to a solar power regime seamlessly and then proceed to shut down all the nonsense that was integral to the old order.</em></p>

<p><em>Anything short of big thinking like this won&#39;t work and is pointless.</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>A most enjoyable and measured response. I was trying to rankle the OP. I think consciousness arose about the first time we ran for our lives. My dog has it, 15 toys and he knows each of their names. He&#39;s got deep agendas, thinking all the time. So, though I appreciate it, I don&#39;t have any clue as to how any of this will benefit anyone. It&#39;s not like we&#39;re going to link to a broken thread of mind and have it flood back in like some kind of knowledge orgasm from our long dead ancestor.</p>

<p>Anyway, I think <em>we&#39;re still waiting to arrive at consciousness</em>. Proof? You&#39;re soaking in it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think we need to be more precise concerning the expression <em>consciousness</em>. IMO it should not be confused with the ability to remember, e.g. such as your dog remembering the names of the toys (plants and microbes have memory as well, for example). Rather, let&#39;s define consciousness as an ability to contemplate your own thoughts and be aware of them, and again, some might argue that plants are conscious as well :-)

    <div class="md"><p>I understood his conscious parts as &quot;civilisation conscious&quot; which defines the level of civilisation and that depends how much we as a race work together. A Dark Age would be a breakdown of conscious from that perspective.</p>

<p>We know about the minor Dark Age after the fall of the Roman Empire, we know about the one around 1200BC related the Mediterranean/near east civilisations but we have only assumptions about the huge one from the &quot;delugian civilisation&quot; to Sumer.</p>

<p>This view makes perfect sense to me and might even be one reason for the globalist agenda from a philosophical and civilisation building perspective. We only really see the economical and culture destroying aspect of it and the one I strongly disagree with.</p>
