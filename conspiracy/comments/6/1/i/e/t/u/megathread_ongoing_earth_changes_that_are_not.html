<p>Have you looked up at the sky lately?</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUvBPqGa_lg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUvBPqGa_lg</a></p>

<p>(bravo on the PG protests; what were the numbers like? hard to find anything online..says 50 people on washington post..)</p>

<p><a href="http://havacuppahemlock1.blogspot.co.uk/2013/07/destruction-of-america-constitution.html">http://havacuppahemlock1.blogspot.co.uk/2013/07/destruction-of-america-constitution.html</a></p>

<p>Will Trump challenge United States, Incorporated?</p>

<p>I will continue to post until I feel there is a change of &quot;pace,&quot; and everything slows down... but I don&#39;t feel like that&#39;s going to happen anytime soon. I don&#39;t feel that I am the only one who has suddenly become &quot;awake,&quot; at something not being quite right at the moment in the world, whether it being a local change I can see or a global change as detailed below.</p>

<p>Please check my older threads for information from end of November 2016 onward.. I have run out of characters because there is just so much shit going on.</p>

<p>Apologies if you have read most of this already.. but just check on the recent updates at the bottom to see that whatever is going on is a global phenomenon and not something to turn your nose up at... and it&#39;s not stopping.</p>

<p>First.. read this - <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170113094903/https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2016/10/13/executive-order-coordinating-efforts-prepare-nation-space-weather-events">https://web.archive.org/web/20170113094903/https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2016/10/13/executive-order-coordinating-efforts-prepare-nation-space-weather-events</a></p>

<p>Regardless what you think, this Order is worded very seriously and encompasses a huge amount of resources in only a short release. It was released rather quickly and;</p>

<p>&quot;But the order bypassed the North American Electric Reliability Corp. (NERC), the interstate grid security monitor, which has been developing solar storm protections for the grid since 2012.</p>

<p>&quot;It was a surprise to us,&quot; said Gerry Cauley, NERC president and CEO.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxaM7BWb4Lw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxaM7BWb4Lw</a></p>

<p>What is the Schumann Resonance? Why is it increasing?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.drjoedispenza.com/blog/consciousness/what-does-the-spike-in-the-schumann-resonance-mean/">http://www.drjoedispenza.com/blog/consciousness/what-does-the-spike-in-the-schumann-resonance-mean/</a></p>

<p>&quot;On January 31, 2017, for the first time in recorded history, the Schumann resonance reached frequencies of 36+ Hz. It was considered an anomaly when in 2014 this frequency rose from its usual 7.83 Hz to somewhere in the 15-25 Hz levels—so a jump from 7.83 Hz to 36+ Hz is a big deal. That’s more than a five-fold increase in resonant frequency levels. What does this mean to us as inhabitants of Mother Earth? According to neuroscience, frequency recordings of 36+ Hz in the human brain are more associated with a stressed nervous system than a relaxed and healthy one.&quot;</p>

<p>Information on the &quot;Earth Wobble,&quot;.. or pole shift etc. Whatever you want to call it.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.wizaurad.com/axis-drift.html">http://www.wizaurad.com/axis-drift.html</a></p>

<p>We are wobbling on our axis, which will obviously have consequences on the earth.. if you notice in that plot diagram that the latter half of 2016 looks much more.. extreme. The Earth Wobbling is natural my only correlation in this is that where the graph gets more extreme is where I feel the world has started to respond at a similar pace.</p>

<p>Why is this happening? I don&#39;t know. So many different things at once, so many theories and facts to digest and dispute.. so much fake information, shit sources!</p>

<p>For Earth Changes (weather,seismic,volcanic) I started posting around November.. because November is when I started to become &quot;awake,&quot; that there is something not quite right with our planet at the moment and it is behaving abnormally.</p>

<p>Why do I say this? Most articles state that scientists are &quot;perplexed,&quot; or &quot;puzzled,&quot; at things that are happening.</p>

<p>FYI - All information is from watchers.news, an invaluable resource which is unopinionated and deals in facts. They reference various local institutions.. obviously depending on what the earth change is.</p>

<p>(I have cut content from older posts, please see those for additional information)</p>

<p>OKAY...</p>

<p>STILL WITH ME?</p>

<p>Going to pre-face December with some quick facts about Earthquakes.. because most of you will be saying &quot;volcanoes and earthquakes happen all the time.&quot; and you&#39;d be RIGHT! they do..</p>

<p>but; There have been 257 earthquakes over magnitude 5 and many more very close to this number. Just to put this into perspective on average there is an estimated 3.6 earthquakes of a magnitude of 5-5.9 a day, in the last 9 days there have been an average of 24.8 nearly 7 times what is usual. It is estimated there is a 6-6.9 magnitude earthquake every 3 days, we have had 2.6 a day for the last 9 days. Lastly for the big earthquakes of magnitude 7-7.9 you usually get 1 every 25 days (estimate) there have been an average of 1 a day for the last 9 days. (Stats from End of Dec.)</p>

<p>This is also referencing a cosmic energy wave, which is also being attributed (mostly on youtube unfortunately.. but nothing [mainstream] is talking about this) a helium gas cloud which we have entered bringing in higher H3,H4 into our atmosphere.
does anybody know what a brown dwarf star is made of????? (HELIUM)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It will likely be a time unlike any other ever faced by mankind, a time of proverbial hell on Earth.  I suspect that if Yellowstone were to pop off, it would not be the only cataclysmic event to rain on our parade.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Guess it&#39;s time to start making my disaster plans... I already have food storage and potable water. I need to get some more .22lr, some filtration systems or respirators, and track down some more surplus ACH helmets and plate carriers. Stock up on batteries for my menagerie of radios, get them set to the same frequency, and get my HAM license. </p>

<p>Something is bound to happen soon. We&#39;re also approaching near the deadline of the Yellowstone caldera. Shit is gonna hit the fan, for sure. Any idea on how to make ballistic plates?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have some experience with preparations for calamities, but in my final analysis, I concluded that I did not want to become a nomad living in a state of nature having to rely heavily upon my baser animalistic qualities.  I have provisions, but I won&#39;t submerge myself in a subterranean structure or flee - I&#39;ll live, fight and die in my home.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t want to either, but you can only store so many supplies and so much water. I keep enough stored for 3 months, at a gallon a day. At some point if you can&#39;t become self sufficient and find a renewable source of food and water, you&#39;re likely screwed. </p>

<p>Having an air filtration system and body armor means it&#39;s that much safer for you to go outside. And I&#39;m also a bit of a Halo nerd who wants a set of working ODST armor, to be fair. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for putting up a thread about this. I&#39;ve been noticing something not right about mother earth and the stars since about September 2016. Something is unsettling in the air, the calm before the storm. I&#39;ve done lots research in all different directions and I truly think something is about to happen. We know the poles are at their limits for flipping. The animals of the sea are going crazy. Volcanoes are cooking up, even inactive ones. There&#39;s a huge increase in censorship on space meter readings and on sky maps ect, huge increase in stratosphere aerosol injection, so much that we had constant fog here for 3 weeks In UK. I think what we&#39;re looking at is potentially the conspiracy of all conspiracies. Pedogate is 100% true, but is being used as a distraction with politics,false flags,wiretapping and the whole anti-muslim agenda being pushed right now. People are seeing 2 sun&#39;s. Extra moons and planets everywhere around the world, nasa mention finding new planets linked to ours after denying it from theorists. I think the reset button for earth may of been pushed</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You replied to my chemtrail post recently with some good information you had researched into &quot;Reconnaissance Ventures Limited,&quot; performing SAI near you.</p>

<p>I &quot;woke up,&quot; a similar time and if you notice that is when I started to make these posts. I really enjoy my life at the moment and if what I am believing will happen does come to pass.. so be it. It may be that moment of rapture/revelation discussed at the end of the Bible where we all becomes believers again. The world is purposefully not ready for what is coming and people like you and I will have front row seats (for however long) to the greatest show you&#39;ve ever seen.</p>

<p>&quot;Blessed are the meek:
for they shall inherit the earth.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think your right here brother. I&#39;m still not sure when but like you I&#39;m the happiest I&#39;ve ever been, the only thing is crave now is more knowledge about everything. No amount of money/drugs/tv/food can fill that craving. Ive always worked in the healthcare sector so I&#39;ve been making sure that I&#39;m spreading love and light to everyone I see, I think it may be our roles to keep people calm when the worse does come, when I say that I don&#39;t mean like leaders or generals kind of way, rather just keeping carm and spreading them waves of peaceful high energy, assuring people it&#39;s all much part of a bigger plan for mankind.  Still having a go at meditation and trying to project outside of the box but been receiving alot of information that I didn&#39;t know previously that I now understand better than topics which I had studied so that&#39;s helping a little with believing some theories into what we can&#39;t see.</p>
