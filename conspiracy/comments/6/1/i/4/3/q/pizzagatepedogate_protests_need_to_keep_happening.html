        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">283</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2017-03-25 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/Winter_Folger.html">Winter_Folger</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I saw a post earlier that said that the Pizzagate/Pedogate protests need to continue for months on end, and I wholeheartedly agree. Think about it, there are shills on this subreddit. There are shills on just about every subreddit imaginable. Whether it&#39;s a Shareblue shill, Russian shill, or even a Taco Bell shill. All across the board, Reddit can agree that there are shills.</p>

<p>It is pretty apparent to me that there is an active brigade against Pedogate. R/Pizzagate got shut down for crying out loud. Sure, you can say that there were aspects of a &quot;witchhunt&quot; and that some personal information may have been posted by people that didn&#39;t know better, but there is still one fact that we must acknowledge; the shills.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s think for a second. What kind of pizza shop owner has the power to have shills at his disposal. Another question: Why and how is James Alefantis so powerful? Yes, I am aware that all evidence regarding Pizzagate is only circumstantial, and that researchers are just &quot;connecting dots that don&#39;t exist&quot;, but at what point do we all agree that Pizzagate is a little weird? We truly must protest to get the officials to pursue an investigation. I saw this mentioned in a Tweet, and it&#39;s pretty damn true, something along the lines of &quot;The FBI can find Tom Brady&#39;s jersey in Mexico, but they can&#39;t find the Missing DC Girls?&quot;.</p>

<p>There are too many dots that have been connected. There are crooked cops everywhere we look. You have to compare these protests to the idea of Pizzagate/Pedogate in general. People are going to walk by and laugh, they&#39;ll walk by again and wonder, then they&#39;ll research, then they&#39;ll probably be on our side. The problem is, people don&#39;t want to believe that our beloved politicians are pedophiles. If you&#39;re pretty deep into conspiracy theories, you know how deep this rabbit hole goes. &quot;Normies&quot; don&#39;t want to literally have their whole reality changed. We oftentimes look down on people that are &quot;stuck in the matrix&quot;, but you have to realize that they&#39;ve fallen victim to a false reality. </p>

<p>My point is, we smelled shit, and we think it&#39;s coming from the dog house; Washington D.C./Langley, VA (CIA HQ). The government has committed sins that I would truly consider to be abominable. MKUltra; using mind control on <strong>UNWITTING</strong> United States citizens, that&#39;s really all I have to mention. MKUltra, is enough to get every citizen thinking about the intentions of the US government. There&#39;s a whole Wikipedia article on Human Rights Violations committed by the CIA; it&#39;s like 20 pages long. </p>

<p>Is it really that absurd to imagine that the government/ABC agencies could be trafficking children/organ harvesting. There&#39;s a lot of money involved, just like in the drug war. The government has sold drugs themselves. The people that start wars. The people that centralized the banks? What is the government hiding from us?</p>

<p>All I&#39;ve got to say is that the the correlation between the use of &quot;Fake News&quot; and &quot;Pizzagate&quot; is honestly uncanny. Pizzagate is where the term &quot;Fake News&quot; came from, similar to how the term &quot;Conspiracy Theorist&quot; was birthed from the suspicions around John F. Kennedy&#39;s murder. I truly think they&#39;re scared. We have to keep letting our presence be known. We have to raise the heat. We need to get the whistle blowers out of the hole. I think we found something that something we weren&#39;t supposed to find. </p>

<p>If people at a Pizzagate protests point to demons, aliens, inter-dimensional-beings, gremlins, I can only conclude one thing; there is someone behind the curtain, and it is evil itself. How far have we come, to the point where we literally think our politicians might be, and very well could be demons, fallen angels, aliens, reptilians, etc. </p>

<p>I think the veil is finally being lifted. The rose-tinted goggles are coming off, as are the gloves. The people are waking up. My final question: If John Podesta is so sure there nothing malicious is going on, how about you go on air and explain your emails? It&#39;s not that hard. </p>

<p>Just saying. </p>

<p>Thanks for reading.</p>

This is David Seaman&#39;s video, he is one of the first journalists to start reporting on pizzagate. Since then Youtube has demonitized his videos and many major news outlets have punlicly denounced him.</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/6SQiQzd__XA">https://youtu.be/6SQiQzd__XA</a>
Idk what hes talking about at the end because I just watched this today. but this is what happened to one of the only members of a major news outlet to report, to my knowledge.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m skeptical on Pizzagate (could be a psy-op) but I&#39;m maintaining an open mind simply due to the fact that other things like this have been exposed in the past from the elite establishment across the world, often times with heavy pushback and denial in the beginning of investigations. It&#39;s not impossible something like this could be happening, and there is certainly a lot of circumstantial evidence presented in the community findings. There&#39;s no actual hard proof...yet. It hasnt been proven fact or fiction in any way. The fact no formal investigation has even been made into this being a possibility is what really drives it home for me. MSM is so furiously attacking this as &quot;fake news&quot; that it&#39;s only adding fuel to the conspiracy fire IMO. I&#39;m hoping there will be more facts and info to come soon so this can be put to bed as either fact or fiction once and for all.</p>

<p>Investigations are frequently launched by circumstantial evidence to gather more and hard evidence.</p>

I completely agree with you especially in the sense that the individuals thay are unwilling to open their eyes or unknowing that their eyes are closed are the victims.

    <div class="md"><p>Pizzagate is too witch-hunty in my opinion. You&#39;re literally naming tons of people as pedophiles. That is an extremely damaging claim to make against a person or persons. What if Comet pizza was actually completely legitimate, Alefantis was actually innocent, but because of crazy rumors, the business loses so much business they have to close. You just put several employees out of work, and ruined a man&#39;s business. Not only that, but what if the guy that had gone in there with guns had actually killed someone? You people promoting pizzagate would have literally been tangentially responsible for someone&#39;s death.  </p>

<p>If you all are so gung-ho about saving the children then why don&#39;t all of you believers pool your resources and I don&#39;t know, hire a D.C. private investigator to look into the matter? </p>

<p>What if Comet Pizza is actually completely illegitimate, Alefantis is actually guilty, and because of crazy rumors, hundreds, if not thousands of children are no longer being sexually abused.</p>

<p>Well we asked the officials to investigate, but they wouldn&#39;t. Maybe that&#39;s because D.C. police chief is Peter Newsham is best buddies with James Alefantis. </p>

<p>You have to realize that WE are the private investigators. A network of people that see through the lies. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m skeptical on Pizzagate (could be a psy-op) but I&#39;m maintaining an open mind simply due to the fact that other things like this have been exposed in the past from the elite establishment across the world, often times with heavy pushback and denial in the beginning of investigations. It&#39;s not impossible something like this could be happening, and there is certainly a lot of circumstantial evidence presented in the community findings. There&#39;s no actual hard proof...yet. It hasnt been proven fact or fiction in any way. The fact no formal investigation has even been made into this being a possibility is what really drives it home for me. MSM is so furiously attacking this as &quot;fake news&quot; that it&#39;s only adding fuel to the conspiracy fire IMO. I&#39;m hoping there will be more facts and info to come soon so this can be put to bed as either fact or fiction once and for all.</p>

<p>Investigations are frequently launched by circumstantial evidence to gather more and hard evidence.</p>

He didn&#39;t, he hit the motherboard, after firing a bullet at a door handle to try to open it. Said bullet penetrated the door, and lodged into the computer in the office which turned out to be an ordinary office and not a secret torture chamber entrance. And ok they moved the camera or something? Still not that strange in my opinion. Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, of which I haven&#39;t seen anything beyond wild speculation and conjecture. </p>
