        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The flow of disinformation, contradicting stories, bad energy, fights on message boards, people just flat out putting each other down is off the charts. I&#39;ve reached a point where I went from being a full blown participant in comment board conversations, to just posting articles and then ditching, letting people thumb them up or down or bicker among themselves. I do have one group of friends online for the last 9 years who I can debate seriously with without any emotional reaction to shit, but I&#39;m watching the boards here, on Facebook, etc turning into war zones, even people supposedly on the same side, just ridicule and be so mean to each other.</p>

<p>What&#39;s the point of that? Every one of us is going off of second hand information. Unless we&#39;ve been at the meetings or a fly on the wall, none of us know the truth, we only know what we&#39;ve been told.</p>

<p>Anyway, I love to research and I love sharing info, but sometimes if you don&#39;t step back you start going batshit.</p>

<p>But sometimes you just gotta step back and regroup your thoughts</p>
</blockquote>

<p>yes and no. </p>

<p>what you actually need to do is clear your thoughts, clear your mind. meditation. prayer. moment of silence. </p>

<p>focus on breathing, focus on heartbeat. </p>

<p>let your mind become inwardwardly aware of itself and your body and bodily functions. let your involuntary functions become voluntary. in other words, take mental control of your body and body functions, and synchronize your mind and body as one, and try to silence and settle both into a meditative, trance-like, zen-like state of mind and body </p>

<p>if your mind is restless, give it a mundane task to perform, such as counting from 1 to 10, or reciting alphabet. these mundane tasks busy the mind and take the mind of other thoughts, even as these tasks are stimulating the mind in very old, basic patterns of thoughts that are deeply etched in your mind from the earliest age, the &quot;root&quot; of all your symbolic understandings, before it was tainted and laden with political and historical baggage</p>

<p>after you do these counting or alphabet reciting, concentrate and reduce your minds attention to a smaller and smaller loop, like count to 4 over and over 1-2-3-4-1-2-3-4 etc (as a drummer might do in a song), then reduce further and count to 2 like 1-2-1-2-1-2 over and over,  then reduce and count to 1 like 1-1-1-1-1-1... thats your moment of zen</p>

<p>it was observed by his assistant that Rev Sun Myung Moon had the ability to focus his attention to a single point, and that seemed to impress the assistant enough to emphasize this fact during a documentary about Rev Moon (Of Moonies Cult infamy) Emperor of the Universe Google Videos not Youtube, very obscure and hard to find  </p>

<p>i think everyone has the ability to focus their attention to a single point, but they do not know how or do not practice enough.</p>

<p>once you settle your mind, fill your mind with high-vibrational thoughts (good vibes) by thinking of nice words like love, peace, joy, happiness, life, etc </p>

<p>and perhaps the most important Word, the Word of God as described in John 1:1</p>

<p><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/1-1.htm">http://biblehub.com/john/1-1.htm</a></p>

<p>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.</p>

We are being propagandized harder than the public in any Latin American country going through a coup.

<p>You are living in an echo chamber created by very powerful algorithms created by and for you. So is the person sitting next to you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is so very important for people to understand.</p>

<p>Especially those who think being &quot;spied on&quot; doesn&#39;t matter.</p>

<p>Everyone&#39;s interpretation of their existence is subjective, but now that experience can be manipulated through the power of suggestion, 24 hours a day. Everything you think, do or say is logged, and thoughts can be isolated like the cancers they are. New ideas can be placed, new convos started, and everyone can be either divided or united--not by force, but by ads, spotify playlists, commercials, google results, etc.</p>

<p>Your life is one big, targeted ad. Not to buy anything, but to buy INTO something.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been a conspiracy THEORIST for my entire thinking, adult life. I emphasize theory, because that was always the point. Anyone could say aliens built the pyramids, but it took a real sage to tell you they were from Planet X, wanted our gold, and would be back in 2080.</p>

<p>Consider the &quot;Russian&quot; story that&#39;s circulating right now. It&#39;s terrible conspiracy theory fodder, because: what&#39;s the THEORY? Russia interfered with our elections to:____<strong><em>. And the preceding administration knows this and is withholding the information because:</em></strong>____<strong><em>. And the hundreds of holdover government employees (who have leaked everything else) haven&#39;t leaked a single piece of damning information showing collusion because:</em></strong>____<strong><em>. And if they have (or don&#39;t have) this information, they obtained it by:</em></strong>______<strong><em>. And if every American is under government surveillance, the incoming administration WASN&#39;T under surveillance because:</em></strong>____________.</p>

<p>The best conspiracy out there right now is that Trump really does kick ass, and draining the swamp is tough work.</p>

<p>But considering the internet got him in office, it&#39;s not hard to see why these very same forums are being weaponized against him to divide and conquer his supporters.</p>

<p>I care not, he&#39;s a conspiracy theorists president. I&#39;ll gladly take the downvotes, and any criticism that comes with it, for my alleged naivete. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>While you&#39;re right to be skeptical of the Russian conspiracy theories until any hard evidence is presented, your questions have pretty obvious answers. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Russia interfered with our elections to:_______. </p>

<p>Help elect candidates that would be favorable to Russian interests, e.g. easing sanctions, reducing American interference in Syria, weakening NATO. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>And the preceding administration knows this and is withholding the information because:__________. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Presumably because exposing the source might compromise it (say if it were a spy, a compromised web server, a wiretap, etc). No one really knows though, so we&#39;re right to be skeptical. </p>

<p>And the hundreds of holdover government employees (who have leaked everything else) haven&#39;t leaked a single piece of damning information showing collusion because:__________. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>If there were any collusion, you would obviously do it through intermediaries, involve only trusted parties, leave no email/paper trail, etc.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And if they have (or don&#39;t have) this information, they obtained it by:____________. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Assumably some classified intelligence gathering. See above. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>And if every American is under government surveillance, the incoming administration WASN&#39;T under surveillance because:_______________.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Trump claimed he was being targeted by the Obama Administration which there&#39;s no evidence for. Now you&#39;re arguing that &quot;technically we&#39;re all under surveillance&quot;? You&#39;re just moving the goalposts.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t really buy the Russian collusion either--election interference seems plausible--but it&#39;s weird to see conspiracy theorists apply a level of scrutiny that most of their pet theories wouldn&#39;t withstand. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>yeah, they get the codes to shut down our defenses if trump sells us out, which he totally would do, maybe not knowingly</p>

<p>that&#39;s the thing with all these meetings prior to and after the election, what arrangements are they making?   I&#39;d be suspicious about any foreign meetings like that, but russia?  When he does business over there?  Supersketchy </p>

<p>I think though what they really want is an american civil war where we dissolve like the soviet union did for what putin probably sees as a point of ego, he wants to see both have to reform not that the american system is just more resilient etc.  </p>

<p>So why not use our openness and stupidity when it comes to foreign bribery to just exacerbate all the tension points using manipulations of new media ie meta site networks (news aggregators with no publicly stated journalistic staff reposting in echo chambers on reddit with team of thousands precisely trolling to get the next big police standoff rolling.  </p>

<p>Then once ferguson is on fire permanently and large areas of the big cities are in total disorder, there is concern over the nuclear missile arsenal.  </p>

<p>those are 2 scenarios where this leads to actual invasion, strategically trump is a complete disaster, overthrowing decades of the actual good part of america&#39;s spying.  </p>

<p>putin is an autocrat and is just as evil as hitler, if not more because he is more calculating, capable and media savy.  </p>

<p>china and russia could definitely take over or split the united states, especially with israel&#39;s help and a traitor president.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel the opposite. I have never been more optimistic and full of life than in 2017. When I was first red pilled 20 years ago I considered the fight against the Illuminati to be a futile effort. The creation of the New World Order was a foregone conclusion that could not be stopped. It was part of a divine plan that would lead to the coming of the anti-Christ and Armageddon. The plan was thousands of years in the making so it was man&#39;s fate to be destroyed like Atlantis was destroyed. </p>

<p>For me 9/11 was the low point because it seemed nothing could be done to wake people up. I pretty much resigned myself to believing that the dark timeline would triumph and the Illuminati would destroy humanity to usher in the age of demons. However, it didn&#39;t unfold that way. </p>

<p>Many planned false flags have been prevented due to pro-active conspiracy theory. The community has exploded in size in recent years. I couldn&#39;t be happier with the number of free thinking souls that now seem to be everywhere. I went from being a lone voice crying out in the wilderness to now being drowned out by a tsunami of the awakened. I am fine with that. It is better this way because it means humanity is winning this fight.</p>

<p>Be of good cheer. Victory over the Illuminati and the new world order is at hand.</p>

<p>Those are classic shill tactics to derail discussions, spread defeatism, divide communities and demotivate people. Remember, shills are the confirmation that you are on the right path. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>People enjoy talking about and unearthing real conspiracies. Instead, this place has been overrun by political attacks and made up conspiracies. There&#39;s a very obvious political agenda behind pumping up bullshit conspiracies (e.g., Pizzagate -- oh no here come the downvotes!) and it takes the wind out of all other conspiracies.</p>

<p>It&#39;s because of r/the_donald and 4chan trying to play &quot;Ender&#39;s Game&quot; with this channel (and reddit in general).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Perhaps a r/PoliticalConspiracies subreddit could cut back on all the shitty shotty politics blasted on this one? </p>

<p>Idk, it gets really annoying and every once in a while I&#39;ll see something that catches my interests, but it turns out to be clickbait more often that not. </p>

<p>I feel like people on this subreddit confuse Conspiracies with every day fucked up shit that gets brought to light. </p>

<p>What&#39;s the conspiracy tho? Just because someone does or says something you don&#39;t like doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re involved in a conspiracy. </p>

<p>Shady shit happens everyday simply because people are shady/ shitty. There is no conspiracy there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Naturally, people who are &quot;into conspiracies&quot; are aware of their own lack of knowledge about the true nature of things.  There&#39;s a certain humility that comes along with this.  In the last 6 months, many people have become part of the conspiracy world (myself included), but they only bought into it because of a particular conspiracy, with a predetermined idea of what the conspiracy was.  </p>

<p>When information challenges that, cognitive dissonance occurs, and they reject it. They aren&#39;t looking at conspiracies as &quot;seeking the truth&quot;, they are simply believing in a conspiracy and participating in the forum because of that, which creates a lot of hostility towards anything that challenges them.</p>

<p>That&#39;s my guess.</p>
