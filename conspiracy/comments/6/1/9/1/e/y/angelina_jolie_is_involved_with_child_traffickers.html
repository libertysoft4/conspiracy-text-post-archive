        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>All of Angelina&#39;s adoptions have proved to been handled through some pretty shady people. She has used every means to get the children adopted by her through false information and other people. </p>

<p><strong>Maddox Adoption</strong></p>

<p>At the time of Maddox&#39;s adoption, the US had imposed tougher restrictions on adopting children from Cambodia due to trafficking fears. 
 In 2003, Angelina Jolie adopts her first child Maddox while still married to Billy Bob. 
In this article she says : Jolie insisted she went to &#39;great lengths to ensure Maddox did not have a living birth-mother in Cambodia&#39; and that she would &#39;never rob a mother of her child.&#39;
In March 2017 A man come forward and says that she used fake info on the adoption to push it through
<a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4329138/Angelina-Jolie-adopted-son-fake-papers.html">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4329138/Angelina-Jolie-adopted-son-fake-papers.html</a> 2017<br/>
The article also mention that the woman who was the adoption agent for her case was later arrested for falsifying information on adoptions. 
After the adoption : the ins suspended adoptions from Cambodia because of fraud and baby stealing happening in that country. 
Maddox’s adoption was brokered by a crooked agent who was later jailed in the U.S. for visa fraud and money laundering involving more than 800 adoptions. Many of the orphans parents were still alive also.
Children’s rights groups investigating Galindo said they believed Maddox’s destitute mother sold her son for $100.

<p><strong>Zahara Adoption</strong></p>

<p>Jolie adopted Ethiopian-born Zahara in 2005.
At the time of her adoption, everyone thought her biological mother, Mentewab Dawit Lebiso, had passed away.
<a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-496176/Why-did-adoption-agency-tell-Angelina-Jolie-I-died-AIDS-gave-baby.html">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-496176/Why-did-adoption-agency-tell-Angelina-Jolie-I-died-AIDS-gave-baby.html</a> </p>

<p>Two years later, in 2007, Lebiso came forward to say she was actually alive. It was too late to get her child back as the adoption was &quot;legal and irrevocable.&quot;
Has been trying for years to be able to just talk to her daughter on the phone and has also said jolie was a good mom to her daughter and does not want to take her back. Just to get to know her.
Angelina has never even acknowledged her publicly or commented on it. Pretty funny considering she has previously stated : and that she would &#39;never rob a mother of her child.&#39; And again information had been falsified on documents.

<p><strong>Pax Adoption</strong></p>

<p>Pax, who had the birth name Pham Quang Sang, was born to Pham Thu Dung, according to IMDb. It is alleged there that Thu Dung was a heroin addict who fled the hospital after Pax’s birth. Pax reportedly had a liver problem which led to a higher hospital bill than Thu Dung could afford. The bill was for £15.<br/>
Pax Jolie-Pitt’s birth mother, Pham Thu Dung, was not dead, but only in prison. She will soon be released and possibly wants her son returned to her.

<p><strong>Problems for Shiloh’s Dual Citizenship</strong></p>

<p>Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie chose for Shiloh to be born in Namibia so she could enjoy dual citizenship. Now Namibian laws are changing and should newly-proposed amendments pass, Shiloh would lose her Namibian citizenship, as All Africa explains. “According to the proposed amendments, all those granted citizenship by birth when their parents did not have permanent residence in the country will lose that status.”

    <div class="md"><p>That woman is Evil. Carried blood around her neck in a vial. Made out with her brother on stage. Had her breasts removed as a &quot;precaution&quot; to cancer. Got some distinguished medal from the queen. Worked to turn a wicked witch into a tragic heroine (with Disney&#39;s help). </p>

<p>I&#39;m suspicious of any celeb that adopts from overseas. Figuring they&#39;re trying to balance their karma from killing a few to moved up the satanic food chain. Charlize Theron as well. Who, along with Adele (who gets weirder by the day), dresses up their little boy like a girl (just like Will and Jada Smith did for their kid).</p>

<p>It&#39;s all a fucking shit show horror show. None of these people should be elevated; they&#39;re merely stars of the clown show. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>a) The queen is evil</p>

<p>b) Promoting cutting off your sexual reproductive organs is part of the <em>evil</em> agenda to de-humanize people and trivialize what makes us as humans unique and beautiful. A sort of religious view that humans are beautifully unique because of our consciousness, so if you&#39;re not religious I don&#39;t think we&#39;ll come to any understanding here. There&#39;s a lot of background knowledge to this one that isn&#39;t exactly well known so I will be fine agreeing to disagree on this one. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m all for trans rights and all that but the way Charlize parades that poor kid around in princess outfits really fucking disturbs me.  She&#39;s humiliating that kid. Something is not right there.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen it with other lesser known Hollywood moms. It&#39;s like a new form of Munchhausen by proxy - forcing a gender identity crisis onto a kid not even 10 years old and basking in the resultant attention. It&#39;s becoming more common.</p>

<p>Charlize Theron is Evil, though I suspect it comes from a long, horrible childhood. Why do you think she was attracted to the Aileen Wuornos story so much? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean, I&#39;m not convinced that dressing a kid up in clothes and appear in photos that might later be upsetting to them is a great idea, but, are you suggesting that you didn&#39;t know that you were a boy (or a girl, old what your gender is) when you where three? I knew I was a girl when I was three. </p>

<p>In my (uninformed) opinion, if a parent thinks their three-year-old might be trans, the sensible thing to do would be to just keep things gender-nuetral until they got old enough to take the lead. </p>

<p>Supposedly her and Brad are both bisexual but as a bisexual guy, most of us don&#39;t see it as relevant vs &quot;in the closet&quot; etc.  Like her when asked or Bowie in 2006, it&#39;s a matter of not lying but not making that be the only thing we are known for.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pff. Adoptions are messy. Ask any adoptive parent. </p>

<p>To begin with, it would be one thing if she was <em>not</em> led to believe the bioparents had passed away, but, that&#39;s what she was told.</p>

<p>Second, tearing a 2-year-old kid away from the only family they&#39;ve ever known is traumatic under any circumstances, let alone circumstances in which the kid has to go live in a place that is far less stable and resourced than the one she lives in. </p>

<p>And on <em>that</em> note: how do Jolie and Pitt know that the people <em>claiming</em> to be birth parents really <em>are</em>, in fact, birth parents? Presumably, a blood test would clear up any confusion.</p>

<p>But, even in the case that these are the birth parents, how do we know they aren&#39;t just trying to extort money out or Jolie and Pitt? </p>

<p>I mean, it&#39;s like a win-win, for these people. Either they can ask for money to go away, or, assuming they manage to get the kids back, they&#39;re in a great position to ask for tons of money to take care of them. And they&#39;d probably get it, too! I mean, if you had to send one of your kids to live in an underdeveloped country and you had the means, wouldn&#39;t you do everything you could to protect them?</p>

<p>But, even putting all that aside and assuming for the sake of argument that any of these people actually gives a shit about the kids they gave birth to, you still can&#39;t fault Jolie. Even this hit-piece trash post admits that she spoke to the woman on the phone. That means she <em>does</em> care about doing the right thing. </p>

<p>So, you can fuck right off with your bullshit. </p>

<p>Oh, and, btw: could you be more of a right-wing shill?</p>

<p>Jolie is literally a 90s Hollywood star. There is no rational reason people would still be carrying on about her unless, oh, wait...</p>
