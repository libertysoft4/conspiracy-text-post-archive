    <div class="md"><p>Omg this thread is ridiculous. All the pizzagate threads are. You have to be completely lacking in any sort of critical thinking skills to not notice how fucking stupid this shit sounds. Here&#39;s a newsflash for you, there&#39;s a really small fringe group of people who believe there is anything to &quot;pizzagate&quot; and to everyone else it sounds completely idiotic. Seriously, this is shapeshifting lizard people levels of ridiculous. So when people come in here and say &quot;wow, this is really stupid&quot; it isn&#39;t because they are being paid. No one is paying anyone to try and cover up &quot;pizzagate&quot;. There&#39;s no need anyway, because even when presented with all the supposed evidence and smoking guns, the average person with at least one foot in reality will think this is completely ridiculous. How on Earth you look at any of those images and think they are sexual in nature... Like holy shit really? Do you also think that about the Coppertone kid? Or the child actors in TV ads? There is nothing sexual about those images. A band with the word &quot;sex&quot; in it played at 10pm once? Omfg call the police! Have you never been to a place that hosts small/local bands before? Jesus. You people take all these random, meaningless things and make absurd connections that aren&#39;t really there and come up with this ridiculously stupid conspiracy theory and then accuse people who say it&#39;s fucking nonsense of being paid shills. I for one know I&#39;m not being paid, I&#39;m just a preschool teacher browsing through reddit in my pajamas on a Sunday morning. The comments in this thread sound completely delusional and I think all of you should probably get off the internet before you lose all touch with reality. Go outside. Talk to other humans, in person. And for fucks sake work on your critical thinking skills.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pizzagate consists of a few random, meaningless things like paintings that most people in their right minds would never interpret as being sexual in nature. The ones with kids in bathing suits? To me they look like just kids who are miserable in gym glass. There is nothing remotely sexual about those images. You pizzagate people assign this hidden meaning to it and to all the other things you claim to be &quot;evidence&quot; because you are looking only for things that confirm what you already believe. That&#39;s why you only talk to the people who share and reinforce your beliefs, and you call everyone else shills or sheep or brainwashed because you automatically reject anything that doesn&#39;t support your story. That is not how critical thinking fucking works. You don&#39;t really care about what&#39;s true, you care about believing what you already believe. When you compile all the &quot;evidence&quot;, until you provide this wild story that assumes all sorts of ridiculous things, it says absolutely nothing. Critical thinking also includes the ability to recognize that if you have to fill in that many blanks in order to explain something then your hypothesis is more than likely bullshit. If you never allow your views to be challenged, then you&#39;re not a critical thinker. Point blank.</p>

<p>And, yeah, you pizzagate people ARE a fringe group, you just don&#39;t think you are because you surround yourselves only with each other. Look how many people showed up to that protest. No one is paying people to &quot;hide&quot; pizzagate because 1) there is nothing to hide in the first place and 2) the vast majority of people, when presented with your &quot;evidence&quot;, don&#39;t leave thinking there&#39;s a secret pedophile ring, they think you&#39;re all off your damn rockers. It isn&#39;t some great effort by the powers that be to suppress &quot;Pizzagate&quot; that is convincing people it&#39;s not true; it is the sheer and utter stupidity of your story. Seriously, for your own good get off the conspiracy websites and forums and actually read things that challenge your views. Talk to people who have different beliefs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m skeptical on Pizzagate (could be a psy-op) but I&#39;m maintaining an open mind simply due to the fact that other things like this have been exposed in the past from the elite establishment across the world, often times with heavy pushback and denial in the beginning of investigations. It&#39;s not impossible something like this could be happening, and there is certainly a lot of circumstantial evidence presented in the community findings. There&#39;s no actual hard proof...yet. It hasnt been proven fact or fiction in any way. The fact no formal investigation has even been made into this being a possibility is what really drives it home for me. MSM is so furiously attacking this as &quot;fake news&quot; that it&#39;s only adding fuel to the conspiracy fire IMO. I&#39;m hoping there will be more facts and info to come soon so this can be put to bed as either fact or fiction once and for all.</p>

<p>Investigations are frequently launched by circumstantial evidence to gather more and hard evidence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Circumstancial evidence? What circumstancial evidence? That WordPress site is ridiculous. There is no evidence of anything. That blog with the kids and the pool appears to be your average mommy blog. Sometimes when people talk about swimming pools, they are just talking about swimming pools. Or handkerchiefs. Or fucking pizza. Finding secret  codes and symbols in ordinary, meaningless things and becoming convinced they spell out the truth about some big secret message isn&#39;t &quot;evidence&quot;, it&#39;s schizophrenia. Literally that is what schizophrenic people do. I guarantee you could go to just about any restaurant or corporate chain and find all sorts of images in their logos/websites/etc that vaguely resemble those pedophile secret symbols. It doesn&#39;t mean shit. This is all so unbelievably delusional. Omg.</p>

<p>Nah, must be scared. </p>

<p>In regards to your link, they&#39;ve gone and expanded Pizzagate to including any and all pedo incidents worldwide - Which is moronic. It&#39;d be like accusing your neighbour of being a murderer without facts, then saying that people get murdered every day, therefore you should be treated seriously. </p>

<p>Pizzagate is the only one to inspire an orchestrated censorship campaign [8] and obvious collusion between the mainstream media, Google, Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, and YouTube [9]. The cover-up proves conspiracy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Flat Earthers claim the same. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Comet Ping Pong website revealed a hidden, password-protected “members only” directory that housed enormous encrypted zip files and provided users with options for uploading and downloading [42]. While certainly a unique feature for a pizza website, such setups are standard operating procedure for child pornography distribution.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Do they know what&#39;s in the zip files? </p>

<p>Looks like it doesn&#39;t matter, pedo&#39;s share zip files so thats OBVIOSLY all the proof you need /s</p>

<p>That&#39;s all these &#39;proofs&#39; are - Here&#39;s something the accused has done, here&#39;s something pedo&#39;s do, lets try build a bridge from our imagination to connect the two while ignoring any remotely sane alternatives. </p>

<p>Someone asking me to stop refuting, now that&#39;s unusual. And suspicious -_-</p>

<p>Isn&#39;t... That the point of combating something?</p>

<p>Why would you combat it if you DO believe in it? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m skeptical on Pizzagate (could be a psy-op) but I&#39;m maintaining an open mind simply due to the fact that other things like this have been exposed in the past from the elite establishment across the world, often times with heavy pushback and denial in the beginning of investigations. It&#39;s not impossible something like this could be happening, and there is certainly a lot of circumstantial evidence presented in the community findings. There&#39;s no actual hard proof...yet. It hasnt been proven fact or fiction in any way. The fact no formal investigation has even been made into this being a possibility is what really drives it home for me. MSM is so furiously attacking this as &quot;fake news&quot; that it&#39;s only adding fuel to the conspiracy fire IMO. I&#39;m hoping there will be more facts and info to come soon so this can be put to bed as either fact or fiction once and for all.</p>

<p>Investigations are frequently launched by circumstantial evidence to gather more and hard evidence.</p>

<p>Because &#39;kids&#39; is a pretty broad range. </p>

<p>so your first premise there is false, you have stretched the truth to say one story, then when the stretched facts are exposed you cling on to the previous conclusion.</p>

<p>This is not logic, this is being emotionally invested in a particular story and giving &quot;facts&quot; and arguments that support that theory leeway and throwing up unnecessary resistance to facts and arguments that oppose it.</p>

<p>Pedogate has been seen world wide.</p>

<p>Millions of people have seen this picture.</p>

<p>Not one person has come forward and said they know her.</p>

<p>We have a clear picture of her We can assume she is from the Washington area and yet no one knows who she is.</p>

<p>No parents,no family,No teachers,no doctors,no friends,no friends parents none has come out and said &quot;oh that&#39;s so and so,she&#39;s in my class,my daughters friend,she&#39;s my patient,she&#39;s fine ,stop harassing her&quot; not a peep.</p>

<p>Where is she ?</p>

<p>Who is she?</p>

<p>Is she safe?</p>

<p>Is she alive?</p>

<p>Pizzaboy claims its his goddaughter. If this is true it would be easy to prove and go along way to clearing his name,Far easier than manipulation of the failing legacy media and censorship of the world wide web.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m skeptical on Pizzagate (could be a psy-op) but I&#39;m maintaining an open mind simply due to the fact that other things like this have been exposed in the past from the elite establishment across the world, often times with heavy pushback and denial in the beginning of investigations. It&#39;s not impossible something like this could be happening, and there is certainly a lot of circumstantial evidence presented in the community findings. There&#39;s no actual hard proof...yet. It hasnt been proven fact or fiction in any way. The fact no formal investigation has even been made into this being a possibility is what really drives it home for me. MSM is so furiously attacking this as &quot;fake news&quot; that it&#39;s only adding fuel to the conspiracy fire IMO. I&#39;m hoping there will be more facts and info to come soon so this can be put to bed as either fact or fiction once and for all.</p>

<p>Investigations are frequently launched by circumstantial evidence to gather more and hard evidence.</p>

<p>most of these people aren&#39;t going to have pictures of the kid, and if they&#39;re reasonable adults they&#39;ll know better than to give details about somebody else&#39;s  kid o the internet.  At least two of those categories would in fact be fired <em>immediately and without recourse</em> if they were found to do so.</p>

<p>its really not that big, you&#39;ve got a distorted view cause the vote bots on here and t_d upvote the shit outta pizzagate stories, but most people don&#39;t know shit about it.  Yeah its been on the news, how many people under the age of 70 you know who watch tv news on the regular?  particularly just off the tv, as opposed to clips that get shared on fb or something.

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s possible this is all coming from Russia, who wants to destabilize all powers and alliances keeping Russia from reforming it&#39;s former Empire. Russia has decades of intelligence analysis on America and knows how much we care about our kids <em>and</em> how paranoid we get about Satanism and Pedophiles. </p>

<p>If I were working for Russian intelligence, I would be actively working to stir up demoralizing, damaging stories against the politician who support NATO so as to help the politician who is friendly to Russia.</p>

<p>This is not a judgement of whether or not the story is valid. I&#39;m afraid it may be.</p>

Right now though, I&#39;m mostly just here to check up a bit on the whole thing.  I can&#39;t help but find it strange though, that you use the line &quot;Yet hear we are, talking about it,&quot; to try and make a point.  You r using an insult to knock down people who are still here working through it, because they must be idiots, because this thing is so dead, right?  Did you miss the &quot;we&quot; in your insult?  If these people here are soooo stupid to be here, because this thing is so dead it&#39;s useless, what the fuck are you doing here in this &quot;we?&quot; Do you think your superior intellect will save these people from themselves when nothing else has so far or are you just here to slam people?

More than likely it&#39;s mostly shills on both sides fighting against each other with regular people just getting caught up in it.</p>

<p>As for shills in general, I doubt they have teams that target one specific thing(like Pizzagate or the Trump Dossier) but instead push a general agenda that benefits their side while weakening the other side.</p>

<p>I advocate it because they apparently like the policy. After all, it&#39;s their fault it is our policy. I hate it, but if they like it they should be fine with the search. Hope you&#39;re ok with that answer.</p>

<p>mobs are basically by definition blood hungry, the eusocial beast we humans form together like an ugly pancake voltron is clumsy and  violent and prone to screaming rage.</p>

<p>and there plenty of reason for pizzagate&#39;s targets to fear the mob <em>is</em> blood hungry, a man already went into comet ping pong with a <em>gun</em>.  So thats score one for &quot;pizzagate believing nuts may show up and shoot you&quot; while &quot;pizzagate believers are reasonable people and the facts are indisputable&quot; is still sitting at zero. </p>

<p>and pedophiles are, rightly, vilified and reviled, being accused of being one is a smear and a stink that cannot be easily washed off no matter how baseless the accusation.</p>

<p>people like to think that they are heroes.  they also want to perform horrible atrocities, but they want to be justified and heroic in doing them.  Killing pedophiles is a fantasy which neatly satisfies these requirements  For this reason the pizzagate story has no doubt captured the hopes and dreams of a number of wannabe violent sociopaths.  And people who <em>like</em> a story become invested in believing in it, and once that happens no evidence that contradicts that story will ever to change their mind.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s really no need to make it a partisan issue.  Not this.  The two parties are very often running controlled opposition games to create false choices and ensure nothing <em>really</em> changes for the people at the top.  This might well be one of the status quo elements they were protecting with their false choice games.  In any case, it doesn&#39;t need to be partisan, because it inherently persuades people in a contrapartisan way.  Expose Republicans doing this shit and the internet will turn against them hard, too.  Expose <em>anyone</em> doing this shit and the internet will turn against them.  James Alefantis&#39; Instagram would be a persuasive marvel against anyone.  Having a creepy pedo subculture presence on social media is political kryptonite.</p>

<p>Do you think it&#39;s practical and plausible for Russian agents to plant all those weird IG posts, put a pedo symbol in a restaurant logo, incept the Podestas to buy twisted quasi-pedophillic art, then leak emails containing code talk that brings it all together???</p>

<p>That&#39;s just stupid. A more plausible explanation is that a string of rich person eccentricities and sinister-seeming language in leaked emails caused conspiracy theorists to draw fantastic conclusions about the people involved.

<p>highlighted the things i consider to be huge assumptions, the interpretation of which drastically alters perception of ht whole business, though i&#39;d like to see a source from before the pizzagate copypasta that shows blue triangles to actually be pedo symbols in the first place.</p>

<p>heres a theory, russian propaganda agents leaked (some evidence suggests altered as well) podesta&#39;s emails.  Deciding they weren&#39;t incriminating enough to smear the democrats with, as was desirable since they were trying to prop up donnie dumbshit, they made up a highly incriminating interpretation of some office jokes about pizza.  Which was probably code for weed come to think about it, i always buy mine by the &quot;slice&quot; or 1/8th.  This disinformation was fortified with images of some creepy looking art podesta bought and some unverified and extremely circumstantial and tenuous links to random child disappearances.  This whole business was compiled into an easily spread meme image and disseminated anonymously through 4chan.</p>

<p>4chan, being the sort of place people go and post cp, has a large population of users who are in deep denial about their own disgusting urges or why they&#39;re surfing /b, and this population latched onto to this story cause it has everything their fevered imaginations most secretly fantasize about: people in positions of power abusing kids with impunity.  So it caught and it spread.</p>

<p>Compare that with the difficulty that would be involved in <em>actually</em> running an elite pedo ring, you just can&#39;t reliably hire that many sociopaths and pedos, and keeping it quiet on top of that?  And not to mention sociopaths will turn on you <em>before</em> the first opportunity, and pedos are basically by definition in a position of weakness and vulnerability which is highly exploitable. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know most of the people here have their minds made up already, and tend to downvote dissenting opinion, but I&#39;ll give you my thoughts on this regardless.</p>

<p>First, it&#39;s quite clear that Jones was threatened by a lawsuit.  They&#39;ve more or less openly said that this was done for legal reasons. </p>

<p>He&#39;s rich as hell. He can afford to suffer a frivolous lawsuit as long as he wins.  But he&#39;s not trying.  That means that Alex Jones has come to the conclusion that &quot;belief in pizzagate&quot; is not something you can defend in court.</p>

<p>Not just that you couldn&#39;t prove it in court, but that you couldn&#39;t defend belief in it.</p>

<p>So now one of the most prominent voices defending the Pizzagate conspiracy still does not believe that it is defensible enough to actually risk anything for it.</p>

<p>That&#39;s not proof of anything.  But it did validate my interpretation of the evidence, which came to the same conclusion.</p>

<p>I think that this whole thing started out as a smear campaign with elements of moral panic from gullible people.  </p>

<p>And I&#39;m not the only person who believes that.  You&#39;re going to see vehement opposition from people who are politically aligned with the people being smeared, because they feel these attacks are baseless and politically motivated.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>​&gt; Not just that you couldn&#39;t <em>prove</em> it in court, but that you couldn&#39;t defend <em>belief</em> in it.</p>

<p>That&#39;s an excellent point. Journalists have a significant amount of privilege when it comes to defamation, as long their statements were made in good faith and without &quot;actual malice.&quot; This even applies if their statements are later proven to be false.</p>

<p>Also worth noting that a retraction can be used as an affirmative defense against a defamation claim. Probably wouldn&#39;t be enough to get him off the hook entirely, but might help mitigate the damage in the event he lost.​​</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I suppose I see what you are getting at. You think Russia just needed to plant the seed by aiding the leaks to begin with and then let things snowball from there? I admit this is a possibility, but will remain skeptical for the time being. I will have a very hard time buying into the DNC/MSM&#39;s narrative, which you are pushing. What I said earlier stands. I don&#39;t care who leaked if the implications are factual and allow the public to be more informed of the possibilities of the inner workings of our government. I do believe the truth will set us free regardless of who is telling it, as long as it is the truth. :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not everyone is. But when the exact same statements come up over &amp; over you can tell it&#39;s like reading from a script.</p>

<p>My favorite is &quot;there&#39;s no evidence&quot;... except the Podesta emails, the Alefantis IG, the weird symbols in Besta &amp; related restaurants, missing children, the catholic church&#39;s proven track record of molesting kids... there is evidence. But then these &quot;Redditors&quot; say it&#39;s not real evidence. Okay so they&#39;re choosing to ignore all the evidence presented <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GZFHLAcG8A">by Ben Swann</a> in a clean-cut format. If this has enough evidence for someone from MSM to cover it then there is at least some evidence. When people call this a baseless conspiracy with no evidence it&#39;s highly suspicious IMO.</p>

<p>If you&#39;ve seen the evidence and don&#39;t believe it amounts to much, fair enough.</p>

<p>But the two talking points that constantly get parroted are &quot;there&#39;s <strong>no</strong> evidence&quot;, implying literally no evidence exists when some does, and the classic &quot;the IG photos were just a joke&quot;. </p>

<p>When I see those comments <em>repeatedly</em> in the same thread by random users it&#39;s astroturfing. The more you read the same arguments ad nauseam you&#39;ll start to notice. Not to mention posters who use blanket insults against this sub(why are they here?).</p>

<p>Bottom line: no they&#39;re not all shills and it&#39;s not because they disagree. It&#39;s the specific way they disagree, almost like pre-written talking points, that makes certain threads seem incredibly shady.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nonsense. Pizzagate developed organically from conclusions drawn from real life things. Weird instagram posts, twisted art and performances, code talk in emails, a pedo symbol in a pizza logo--you literally can&#39;t make this shit up. </p>

<p>The only &quot;the Russians did it&quot; argument you could possibly make here is that after Pizzagate took off, they hired shills/turfers to keep it alive, but honestly I don&#39;t think something as sensational as this really needs help to stay alive. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>anyone who deligimitizes all their opposition as paid without refuting their points obviously is standing on very shaky ground and is merely deflecting. The entire premise of the conspiracy from a logical non emotional viewpoint is ridiculous so of course initially people are going to attack it as absurd, half the proponents of it think it is actual satanists doing everything, of course nobody is going to take it seriously the only satanists around are edgy atheists getting a rise out of fundies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not entirely true.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_of_Set">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_of_Set</a> ; &quot;The Temple of Set is an occult initiatory order founded in 1975. A new religious movement and form of Western esotericism, the Temple espouses a religion known as Setianism, whose practitioners are called Setians. This is sometimes identified as a form of Satanism, although this term is not often embraced by Setians and is contested by some academics.</p>

<p>The Temple was established in the United States in 1975 by Michael Aquino, an American political scientist, military officer, and a high-ranking member of Anton LaVey&#39;s Church of Satan. Dissatisfied with the direction in which LaVey was taking the Church, Aquino resigned and – according to his own claim – embarked on a ritual to invoke Satan, who revealed to him a sacred text called The Book of Coming Forth by Night. According to Aquino, in this work Satan revealed his true name to be Set, which had been the name used by his followers in ancient Egypt. Aquino was joined in establishing the Temple by a number of other dissatisfied members of LaVey&#39;s Church, and soon various Setian groups were established across the United States.&quot; ; <a href="http://disinfo.com/2013/09/devils-advocate-interview-dr-michael-aquino/">http://disinfo.com/2013/09/devils-advocate-interview-dr-michael-aquino/</a></p>

People need to talk about this. There are numerous cases popping up overseas of trafficking rings being busted, with big players involved. What? Are we just so fucking star spangled awesome that we wouldn&#39;t have the same issue? But of course we dont talk about this. Do you know anyone who could tell you how many children go missing globally in a month of the top of their head? How about nationally? How about in your own fucking state?

</blockquote>

<p>Personally, I think the great rubicon of conspiracy has to do with ET visitation of Earth, and full public ET disclosure. Pizzagate is up there alright, but even if arrests are made, charges pressed, and convictions served, it will be a big deal, but I don&#39;t think it would be too groundbreaking in the grand scheme of things. We know pedophile rings have been around for millennia, and probably will continue to pop up in the future, in spite of our efforts. Full public ET disclosure on the other hand has the potential to radically accelerate our species technological development, especially when it comes to clean energy and interstellar travel.</p>

<p>If high level officials who have &quot;authority&quot; were proven to be molesting children and lying about it, that would absolutely be groundbreaking and it would affect every single person in the world.</p>

<p>Everyone would need to realize that people in power lie. They did lie, and in that scenario they lied about something that would go beyond mafia level crimes. The average person would need to seriously question what authority even means. Why were these people trusted in the first place? Why did the average person think they were &quot;normal&quot; and trust them, give them power, etc?</p>

<p>I agree that topics like ET, life after death, higher dimensions, what is consciousness... these are more significant than satanic elite practices. But to say it wouldn&#39;t be &quot;too groundbreaking&quot; if well known politicians were literally arrested and convicted of this? No my dude. That would be one of the most groundbreaking events in centuries.</p>

<p>It would be significant, that&#39;s for sure, but I mean to say it wouldn&#39;t come as much of a shock at this point. Elite pedophile rings are nothing new, and politicians have been arrested and convicted of this type of stuff before. Plus, we already know about some of the bizarre, I guess you could call &#39;satanic&#39; practices that some of the elite engage in at the Bilderberg meetings and whatnot.</p>

<p>We may see the arrests of Podesta and a few fall guys, but it&#39;s unlikely that we&#39;ll get them all, unfortunately. Pizzagate, pedogate, elite pedophilia, whatever you want to call it, is a type of evil we&#39;ll probably have to rage against for years to come, and we may never get a true sense of closure. I hope I&#39;m wrong.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m skeptical on Pizzagate (could be a psy-op) but I&#39;m maintaining an open mind simply due to the fact that other things like this have been exposed in the past from the elite establishment across the world, often times with heavy pushback and denial in the beginning of investigations. It&#39;s not impossible something like this could be happening, and there is certainly a lot of circumstantial evidence presented in the community findings. There&#39;s no actual hard proof...yet. It hasnt been proven fact or fiction in any way. The fact no formal investigation has even been made into this being a possibility is what really drives it home for me. MSM is so furiously attacking this as &quot;fake news&quot; that it&#39;s only adding fuel to the conspiracy fire IMO. I&#39;m hoping there will be more facts and info to come soon so this can be put to bed as either fact or fiction once and for all.</p>

<p>Investigations are frequently launched by circumstantial evidence to gather more and hard evidence.</p>

It was discontinued, but may have been revamped under a new name, pushed further underground, and expanded ten-fold, like many other &quot;discontinued&quot; CIA operations.

<p>Alex Jones didn&#39;t come up with pizzagate.</p>

<p>He has always been worried about reporting on it.</p>

<p>When ever he mentions pedogate he makes it very clear that he thinks Pedo point pong is a distraction.</p>

<p>To an extent he&#39;s right.</p>

<p>Hillary Clinton and Jon pedoesta doh not rape children AT Comet pizza. This is the most extreme version of the pizzagate theory and the one pushed by the media so I think its safe to that it doesn&#39;t happen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you mean &quot;your point is moot.&quot; </p>

<p>Mute refers to a lack of sound. When we mute our TVs the sound is turned off. A deaf-mute is someone who cannot hear and cannot speak. </p>

<p>A moot point is one open to debate though it is not used that way, at least in the US. But in its common usage it refers to a question that doesn&#39;t need to be discussed or is not open to debate. While you are describing a weak or inconsequential argument and not the debatability of a point, your usage isn&#39;t too far removed from that common usage.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is real simple folks. </p>

<p>No person or entity spends $$$ smearing and trying to delegitimise shit that plain and simple is not true. </p>

<p>Sure, there are trillion dollar corps that would put out a campaign to counteract bad PR even if it wasn&#39;t the truth, for no other reason than to save face and make sure the public doesn&#39;t fall for the rumor or misinformation. </p>

<p>BUT, when they spend millions of $$$, what can ultimately be MILLIONS of man hours, to try and delegitimise a subject that in the grand scheme, is ONLY being quietly discussed in the farthest corners of the internet and basically NOWHERE else on Earth...Idk guys, doesn&#39;t that in ITSELF prove the disputed &quot;subject&quot; true? Didn&#39;t your mama teach you &quot;Doth thou protest too much&quot;!</p>

<p>The MSM and members of the elite are protesting WAYYYYYY too much. </p>

<p>Downvote me to the bottom see if I give a fuck! MORE people need to speak their opinion more frankly so that the discussions around here can try and liven up some! Were waging a war with the paid shills and bots, the least we can do so using this site doesn&#39;t have to feel like work is to try and present all our different ideas and thoughts? Well I do and if I&#39;m wrong well fuck I guess Reddit finally shit the bed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m skeptical on Pizzagate (could be a psy-op) but I&#39;m maintaining an open mind simply due to the fact that other things like this have been exposed in the past from the elite establishment across the world, often times with heavy pushback and denial in the beginning of investigations. It&#39;s not impossible something like this could be happening, and there is certainly a lot of circumstantial evidence presented in the community findings. There&#39;s no actual hard proof...yet. It hasnt been proven fact or fiction in any way. The fact no formal investigation has even been made into this being a possibility is what really drives it home for me. MSM is so furiously attacking this as &quot;fake news&quot; that it&#39;s only adding fuel to the conspiracy fire IMO. I&#39;m hoping there will be more facts and info to come soon so this can be put to bed as either fact or fiction once and for all.</p>

<p>Investigations are frequently launched by circumstantial evidence to gather more and hard evidence.</p>

<p>As for Edgar Welsh the shooter, people questioned him from the beginning as do I. Welsh is an actor and had been involved with a hit and run in August, I believe, that he wasn&#39;t jailed for. Maybe a deal was made and it was a false flag attack.</p>

<p>As crazy as ^ that sounds, with the precedent of cover ups and corruption right here it becomes much more plausable, I think.</p>

<p>But I tell people all the time, the damning evidence doesn&#39;t lie in a pizza place, its in the organizations that these politicians support. Like Hilary and her Baptist Orphanages in the Domincan Republic that steal babies from Haiti.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Omg this thread is ridiculous. All the pizzagate threads are. You have to be completely lacking in any sort of critical thinking skills to not notice how fucking stupid this shit sounds. Here&#39;s a newsflash for you, there&#39;s a really small fringe group of people who believe there is anything to &quot;pizzagate&quot; and to everyone else it sounds completely idiotic. Seriously, this is shapeshifting lizard people levels of ridiculous. So when people come in here and say &quot;wow, this is really stupid&quot; it isn&#39;t because they are being paid. No one is paying anyone to try and cover up &quot;pizzagate&quot;. There&#39;s no need anyway, because even when presented with all the supposed evidence and smoking guns, the average person with at least one foot in reality will think this is completely ridiculous. How on Earth you look at any of those images and think they are sexual in nature... Like holy shit really? Do you also think that about the Coppertone kid? Or the child actors in TV ads? There is nothing sexual about those images. A band with the word &quot;sex&quot; in it played at 10pm once? Omfg call the police! Have you never been to a place that hosts small/local bands before? Jesus. You people take all these random, meaningless things and make absurd connections that aren&#39;t really there and come up with this ridiculously stupid conspiracy theory and then accuse people who say it&#39;s fucking nonsense of being paid shills. I for one know I&#39;m not being paid, I&#39;m just a preschool teacher browsing through reddit in my pajamas on a Sunday morning. The comments in this thread sound completely delusional and I think all of you should probably get off the internet before you lose all touch with reality. Go outside. Talk to other humans, in person. And for fucks sake work on your critical thinking skills.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think this mob is blood hungry.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>mobs are basically by definition blood hungry, the eusocial beast we humans form together like an ugly pancake voltron is clumsy and  violent and prone to screaming rage.</p>

<p>and there plenty of reason for pizzagate&#39;s targets to fear the mob <em>is</em> blood hungry, a man already went into comet ping pong with a <em>gun</em>.  So thats score one for &quot;pizzagate believing nuts may show up and shoot you&quot; while &quot;pizzagate believers are reasonable people and the facts are indisputable&quot; is still sitting at zero. </p>

<p>and pedophiles are, rightly, vilified and reviled, being accused of being one is a smear and a stink that cannot be easily washed off no matter how baseless the accusation.</p>

<p>people like to think that they are heroes.  they also want to perform horrible atrocities, but they want to be justified and heroic in doing them.  Killing pedophiles is a fantasy which neatly satisfies these requirements  For this reason the pizzagate story has no doubt captured the hopes and dreams of a number of wannabe violent sociopaths.  And people who <em>like</em> a story become invested in believing in it, and once that happens no evidence that contradicts that story will ever to change their mind.</p>

<p>but I don&#39;t think it would be too groundbreaking in the grand scheme of things</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If high level officials who have &quot;authority&quot; were proven to be molesting children and lying about it, that would absolutely be groundbreaking and it would affect every single person in the world.</p>

<p>Everyone would need to realize that people in power lie. They did lie, and in that scenario they lied about something that would go beyond mafia level crimes. The average person would need to seriously question what authority even means. Why were these people trusted in the first place? Why did the average person think they were &quot;normal&quot; and trust them, give them power, etc?</p>

<p>I agree that topics like ET, life after death, higher dimensions, what is consciousness... these are more significant than satanic elite practices. But to say it wouldn&#39;t be &quot;too groundbreaking&quot; if well known politicians were literally arrested and convicted of this? No my dude. That would be one of the most groundbreaking events in centuries.</p>

<p>to <strong>plant all those weird IG posts</strong>, put a pedo symbol in a restaurant logo, incept the Podestas to buy twisted quasi-pedophillic art, then leak emails <strong>containing code talk</strong> that brings it all together???</p>
</blockquote>

<p>highlighted the things i consider to be huge assumptions, the interpretation of which drastically alters perception of ht whole business, though i&#39;d like to see a source from before the pizzagate copypasta that shows blue triangles to actually be pedo symbols in the first place.</p>

<p>heres a theory, russian propaganda agents leaked (some evidence suggests altered as well) podesta&#39;s emails.  Deciding they weren&#39;t incriminating enough to smear the democrats with, as was desirable since they were trying to prop up donnie dumbshit, they made up a highly incriminating interpretation of some office jokes about pizza.  Which was probably code for weed come to think about it, i always buy mine by the &quot;slice&quot; or 1/8th.  This disinformation was fortified with images of some creepy looking art podesta bought and some unverified and extremely circumstantial and tenuous links to random child disappearances.  This whole business was compiled into an easily spread meme image and disseminated anonymously through 4chan.</p>

<p>4chan, being the sort of place people go and post cp, has a large population of users who are in deep denial about their own disgusting urges or why they&#39;re surfing /b, and this population latched onto to this story cause it has everything their fevered imaginations most secretly fantasize about: people in positions of power abusing kids with impunity.  So it caught and it spread.</p>

<p>Compare that with the difficulty that would be involved in <em>actually</em> running an elite pedo ring, you just can&#39;t reliably hire that many sociopaths and pedos, and keeping it quiet on top of that?  And not to mention sociopaths will turn on you <em>before</em> the first opportunity, and pedos are basically by definition in a position of weakness and vulnerability which is highly exploitable. </p>
