        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So I think this sub agrees that Rich&#39;s death was very suspicious. </p>

<p>The overwhelming narrative seems to be that HRC or DNC had Rich killed because he was the leaker. Does this make sense? DNC could have had Rich prosecuted and jailed for information that was ALREADY leaked if he was in fact the leaker. So why would they kill him? US IC was able to figure out that Russians hacked the DNC, so Rich being a leaker doesn&#39;t make much sense. Rich was also staunchly pro-Democrat his whole life and took the job to support the party he served. So why would he leak anything to hurt the Dems?</p>

<p>On the other side of the equation. Breaking news from a GOP lobbyist Burkman who has received &quot;evidence&quot; that Rich was actually killed by Russians for exposing the Russian hack of the DNC. Rich was a data analyst for the DNC, he would be in a position to know what the Russians were up to first. The GOP lobbyist is working DIRECTLY with Rich&#39;s parents, so Rich&#39;s parents trust him. And DNC is working directly with the GOP lobbyist and police to try to figure out what happened here. Would Russians want to hide this information from hitting the public realm? Yes. It would essentially put a spotlight on them and their ties to Trump. Has Russia killed leakers and political opponents in the past? Most definitely. Does the GOP lobbyist have reason to be supporting the DNC? No, not really. He&#39;d be going against party to come out and support the Russian narrative. He also put up $105,000 of his own money as reward for information leading to identifying Rich&#39;s killer. And also wrote letters to congress to have this matter investigated. </p>

<p>While Burkman is reluctant to elaborate, he revealed he was recently contacted about the investigation by a man claiming to be a former U.S. intelligence officer. The source is an older man, 65-70 years old, who claims to have been a contractor in Iraq in the 1970s, he revealed.</p>

<p>&#39;The source has claimed that it [the murder] was arranged by the Russian government at a very high level,&#39; Burkman said.</p>

<p>&#39;He didn&#39;t specify who or how. He just said he had knowledge it was arranged by the Russian government and stressed that it was at a high level.&#39;</p>

<p>easy tiger.  it&#39;s clear HRC had zero credibility with classified intelligence security (by intentionally breaching <em>top secret</em> procedures), that she went well beyond protocols to remain outside of jurisdiction by setting up the private email server.</p>

<p>DNC leaks added more fuel to that fire, illustrating how incompetent they were with cyber security. I see they are now saying the worst thing about the DNC leaks was that there was a Donald strategy. FALSE - the DNC leaks exposed the corruption and collusion throughout the DNC.</p>

<p>When the Podesta leaks and phishing happened, it accentuated, yet again, how incompetent these baffoons were with sensitive material that they couldn&#39;t even use 2-factor authentication or not be dumb enough to email passwords. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course. The establishments goal has been to turn public opinion on Russia knowing that conflict was inevitable to complete their agenda in Syria and Iran. They tied Russia and Trump to open up the formerly anti war Dems to the idea. </p>

<p>Man it is dirty to kill someone, paint it as a robbery for a while, and then decide to use it to further your agenda that the deceased was fighting.</p>

<p>Seth was a staffer not an IT guy. What are the odds he had info of Russian hacking and uncovered it VS he collected info against the DNC (that we saw released, no proof of hacking if he found it) that was easily accessed by him? Then ask yourself which would be more likely to be discovered that Russia discovered a high up DNC staffer was on to them or that the DNC noticed based on his clearance and his attitude which they see daily that he was the one?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t see anyone tying Russians to Trump except Trump and his team members. When you say the establishment is doing it all. Why is all the evidence a direct result of Trump and his team&#39;s own actions?</p>

<p>Seth was a staffer and not IT? Burkman who works directly with Rich&#39;s parents seem to disagree with you. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#39;Seth was in charge of all the tech guys and a whole technical aspect of voting at the DNC. He was the avant-garde of tech.
&#39;It&#39;s very logical and very likely that if anyone would have discovered this [Russian hack] – Seth would have.&#39;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So what is more likely you ask me to ask myself. That Russians discovered that Rich was onto their scheme or that DNC found out he was the leaker? Well if DNC found out he was the leaker they could have prosecuted him instead of engaging in a risky covert murder could they not? That doesn&#39;t make any sense to me. </p>

<p>But if Russia had the ability to hack the DNC like US IC says they do. Then they could have seen emails written by Rich to DNC higher-ups trying to expose this scheme. So it&#39;s not out of the realm of possibility that Russia could have known of Rich&#39;s discovery and tried to put a lid on it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah the DNC could do that, but if you recall Podesta discusses hitting potential leakers hard in his emails that sounded like he was speaking extrajudicial.</p>

<p>Russians would have no reason to hit Seth Rich, there would be much better targets. They wouldn&#39;t know if he had found out (about that thing they likely didn&#39;t do) , he wouldn&#39;t be the one to find out, and lastly if they were found out there would be no benefit to killing Rich. They kill people for what they can tell.</p>

<p>Russians had nothing to do with it. It is a dumb suggestion.
If the DNC knew it was Rich and knew he still had information he could tell and just come out openly and speak against them then trying to go the legal route (in which nothing would really happen to him and he would be free to speak), it wouldn&#39;t do much at all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. And yeh, I think investigators have identified that Rich&#39;s money, necklaces, phone etc were in tact after murder took place. Maybe there was a ring no one knew about that was taken? I don&#39;t know, I think if you are a mugger willing to go all the way and murder someone. Keep in mind, no signs of struggle, just straight up walked up to someone and shot them. I think the mugger would have taken everything he could have to go that far. </p>

<p>At this point though, it remains a mystery. But of all the conspiracy theories I mean Burkman, who works with Rich&#39;s family directly and is a lawyer and GOP lobbyist seems to have the most credibility. </p>

<p>This is what makes me feel like it was random violence. Seth&#39;s walking down the street, minding his own business, and some coward guns him down behind his back.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t put anything past the Russians.  I know their feelings towards Democrats, and their willingness to meddle in American politics.  I just don&#39;t know if Rich was &quot;important&quot; enough to merit an assassination.  Then again, maybe that was the point, take out someone who isn&#39;t high profile.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know, man.  Anything is possible. I just think it was random violence based on my experiences with visiting DC and knowing how bad the violent crime problem is. </p>

<p>And yeh Rich does seem like someone low on the totem pole for Russia to kill. But his death set up 3 strategic advantages for Russia:</p>

<p>1) Allows them to blame a &quot;leaker&quot; rather than take blame for hacking.</p>

<p>2) Allows them to shut down anyone who might know they were the ones hacking</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been thinking of this concept for awhile now. A DNC murder of Rich just looks so bad on the surface, so readily available for the conspiracy game to latch onto. The only possible scenario for Rich&#39;s death (as explained on this board ad naseum) was inside job. Often mentioned is the idea that he was a Bernie diehard appalled by the party&#39;s treatment of his run, thus decided to leak everyone&#39;s comms and expose the devious conspiracy. Following that angle is convenient-- there were at the time multiple pro-Bernie facebook groups that used to platform to push various Clinton conspiracies during the election, disseminating the stories to unwitting group members, and at least one of these groups was found to be of Eastern Euro origin. </p>

<p>(I won&#39;t excuse the DNC&#39;s treatment of Sanders in any way, he was my guy). </p>

<p>An FSB murder of Rich achieves several goals. You get a DNC data analyst out of the way, and you allow for the possibility of the hack to instead be seen as a leak, knowing that a sudden Dem staffer death would certainly make it look like a retribution hit and possible cover-up. It&#39;s not fullproof, but it&#39;s something. More to come. </p>

Propaganda, disinfo, cyber ops, and good old spies are all cheap and effective.</p>

<p>He was a Fox News analyst in addition to appearing on all the other cable news networks. From all indications he&#39;s approaching this investigation in a non-partisan, truth-finding way. Appears legit and worthy of following.  </p>

<p>In June and July 2016, cybersecurity experts and firms, including CrowdStrike,[50] Fidelis, Mandiant, SecureWorks and ThreatConnect, stated the DNC email leaks were part of a series of cyberattacks on the DNC committed by two Russian intelligence groups, called Fancy Bear and Cozy Bear,[9] also known respectively as APT28 and APT29.[50][51] ThreatConnect also noted possible links between the DC Leaks project and Russian intelligence operations because of a similarity with Fancy Bear attack patterns.[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_interference_in_the_2016_United_States_elections#Cybersecurity_analysis">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_interference_in_the_2016_United_States_elections#Cybersecurity_analysis</a></p>

<p>You believe wrong. </p>

<p>Actually the CIA said that it was &quot;NOT reliable&quot; that Iraq had WMDs. The CIA intelligence reports have been declassified and released due to a FOIA request. Maybe you should read it and realize that it was Bush, Cheney, GOP, and their corporate big oil overlords that wanted to lie and misrepresent an intelligence report to go get Oil. Sound familiar to the Rex Tillerson wet dream deal for Oil in Russia once Sanctions are lifted?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;The firm suspects they may have targeted DNC employees with “spearphishing” emails. These are communications that appear legitimate — often made to look like they came from a colleague or someone trusted — but that contain links or attachments that when clicked on deploy malicious software that enables a hacker to gain access to a computer. “But we don’t have hard evidence,” </p>

<p>&quot;CrowdStrike is continuing the forensic investigation, said Sussmann, the DNC lawyer. “But at this time, it appears that no financial information or sensitive employee, donor or voter information was accessed by the Russian attackers,” he said.&quot;</p>

<p>ONE company had actual access to the server.  The remaining relied on samples provided by Crowdstrike.  They got one of two initial claims correct - a 50% rating.  When we are talking historically important potential for treason, I&#39;m gonna need some more.</p>

<p>RE WMD, ok how about Clapper telling americans - we dont spy on you.  bull fucking shit. They tell us the story they need to sell.  It is their job.</p>

<p>But let&#39;s go with your seemingly naive trust in the IC..  In January, Clapper  frmr DNI stated no evidence of collusion.  ODNI is the IC aggregator &amp; let&#39;s be clear, NSA would have that info.  Someone in our intrusive government would have that info.  Why no evidence of collusion?  There is no doubt the Flynn info came from a leaked IC finding.  If that&#39;s the best they got, I&#39;m not sure a candidate has ever run with less interaction with foreign nations in the lead up to the campaign.</p>
