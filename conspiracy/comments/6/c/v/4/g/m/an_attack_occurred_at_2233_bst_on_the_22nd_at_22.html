<p>How many &quot;coincidences&quot; do you need before you accept that there are no coincidences?  Seriously, pick a number and start counting.  It&#39;s simply a matter of time before you find them.</p>

<p>We&#39;re quietly told again and again, &quot;they&#39;re just numbers.&quot;  Meanwhile, TPTB plan and pull events like last night&#39;s bombing to coincide with all these parallels.  They&#39;re practically flaunting it <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-manchester-40010124">in this article:</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is the worst terrorist attack in the UK since the 7 July bombings in 2005, in which 52 people were killed by four suicide bombers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>7th day of the 7th month in 2005 (2+0+0+5=7) where 52 (5+2=7) people died.</p>

<p>We throw around the term &#39;TPTB&#39; quite liberally here because it&#39;s an easy way to create an undefined, shared enemy.  But who do you think The Powers That Be really are?  Who could possibly coordinate these events to such detail that they control not only the when, the where, and the what but also how many victims there will be?</p>

<p>Do you think terrorists can do that?</p>

<p>How about our governments?</p>

<p>Masons?  The Illuminati?  Do you think they&#39;re that coordinated?</p>

<p>What about <em>aliens</em>?  You want to blame all this on extraterrestrials?</p>

<p>Or might TPTB be a part of something far more cosmic?</p>

<p>Society will provide you with a never-ending list of boogeymen.  It&#39;s time to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegory_of_the_Cave">come out of the cave</a> and see the metagame being played around you.  Someone <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/predictions/comments/6clshm/fire_at_the_grand_scarborough_england">symbolically-predicted this would happen through their dreams.</a>  People are waking up, be one of them.</p>

<p>Overview</p>

<p>Beedrill shines in the UU metagame thanks to its Mega Evolution, which, by way of amazing Attack and Speed stats and Adaptability, grants it the strongest U-turn in the tier, letting it pummel offensive and defensive teams alike. It can grab offensive momentum with very little trouble thanks to the aforementioned qualities, which makes it one of the best offensive Pokemon in the tier. However, Beedrill has a somewhat shallow movepool aside from its STAB attacks, and it only has access to Knock Off and Drill Run as offensive coverage moves. It also has pitiful defensive stats, as well as a mediocre defensive typing. It also is forced to run Protect so that it can Mega Evolve and get the Speed boost without taking damage, as its Speed before Mega Evolving is decent at best. Despite these flaws, Beedrill is still a fantastic Pokemon, and it should always be considered when making an offensive team.</p>

Ability: Swarm
EVs: 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spe
Jolly Nature
- U-turn
- Protect
- Poison Jab
- Knock Off</p>

<p>Moves</p>

<p>U-turn is Beedrill&#39;s main STAB move, as it nets Beedrill offensive momentum with little trouble and is useful to get some chip damage. Protect is used so that Beedrill can get the Speed boost from Mega Evolving without taking any damage and is also useful to scout for foes&#39; movesets and potential Choice items. Poison Jab is Beedrill&#39;s strongest attack, as well as its main Poison-type STAB attack, and it has a fairly high chance to poison the target, which works well in conjunction with Protect to rack up damage on the foe while scouting for its moveset. Knock Off hits Ghost-types such as Chandelure for super effective damage and also cripples Pokemon reliant on their item. Drill Run is mainly used for coverage, as it hits Poison- and Steel-types that resist Beedrill&#39;s STAB attacks, such as Tentacruel, Nidoking, Nidoqueen, and Lucario, for super effective damage.</p>

<p>Set Details</p>

<p>A standard EV spread is used to max out Beedrill&#39;s offensive prowess, with the remaining EVs in Defense so it can maintain an odd HP number. A Jolly nature is used so Beedrill can Speed tie with other base 145 Speed Pokemon, such as Mega Sceptile and opposing Beedrill. An Adamant nature can be used instead to give Beedrill a little extra power.</p>

<p>Usage Tips</p>

<p>Protect should be used the first turn Beedrill is sent out if the opposing Pokemon is faster, as it lets Beedrill safely Mega Evolve and attain the Speed boost without taking damage, scouting the foe&#39;s moveset in the process. Although it has poor defensive stats, Beedrill&#39;s decent defensive typing gives it 4x resistances it can use to switch in. However, some powerful physical moves such as Mienshao&#39;s Reckless High Jump Kick have a shot at 2HKOing it, although Beedrill can use Protect to scout and potentially make Mienshao take crash damage. Beedrill can grab momentum with little trouble thanks to its strong U-turn and high Speed stat, so pairing it with entry hazard users is a good idea. Keeping entry hazards off your side of the field is appreciated, as Beedrill will be switching out more than often due to U-turn and can be KOed by priority users after Stealth Rock damage.</p>

<p>Team Options</p>

<p>Entry hazard support is appreciated, as Beedrill can force out a good portion of the tier and grab offensive momentum easily with U-turn. As such, entry hazard setters such as Swampert, Roserade, Froslass, and Chesnaught are good partners for Beedrill. Spikes in particular also works well with Beedrill, as it weakens most of Beedrill&#39;s grounded checks. Entry hazard removers also work well with Beedrill, as it is weak to Stealth Rock and will be switching in and out very often, so Empoleon, Donphan, and Gligar, the latter forming a nice momentum core with Beedrill, are good partners for it. Other U-turn and Volt Switch users, such as Crobat, work like a charm when paired up with Beedrill, as they can pivot out to Beedrill with little trouble and keep up offensive momentum.</p>

<p>Other Options</p>

<p>X-Scissor can be used over U-turn if you feel that keeping up offensive momentum is not necessary, as it hits for more damage. Swords Dance can be used to boost Beedrill&#39;s attack immensely, but Beedrill usually does not have the room to run this and finds it difficult to set up. If it does manage to set up, it can still get revenge killed easily by priority and Choice Scarf users, so running Swords Dance is not usually worth the loss of coverage. Toxic Spikes can be used to wear down some of Beedrill&#39;s switch-ins, such as Alomomola and Porygon2, making it easier for Beedrill to deal with them later in the game. Pursuit is an option to cause significant damage to fleeing Ghost-types and Psychic-types, such as Reuniclus and Chandelure.</p>

<p>Checks and Counters</p>

<p>Stealth Rock: As Beedrill uses U-turn often, it generally does not stay in for long periods of time. Passive damage from Stealth Rock wears down Beedrill quickly and pressures it to stay off the field.</p>

<p>Choice Scarf Users and Faster Pokemon: Because Beedrill has a very high Speed stat, Choice Scarf users such as Hydreigon and Darmanitan can take it on. It should be noted, however, that Beedrill outspeeds Choice Scarf users that aren&#39;t above base 80 Speed. Mega Aerodactyl outspeeds Mega Beedrill and OHKOes it with its STAB attacks.</p>

<p>Priority Attacks: Beedrill&#39;s pitiful defenses make it extremely susceptible to priority, such as Lucario and Entei&#39;s Extreme Speed and Fletchinder&#39;s Acrobatics.</p>

<p>Bulky Steel-types: Due to their huge physical bulk and defensive typing, Mega Aggron, Doublade, and Forretress scoff at all of Beedrill&#39;s attacks and can OHKO it with their Steel-type STAB attacks. However, Doublade doesn&#39;t like having its Eviolite Knocked Off.</p>

<p>Bulky Pokemon that Resist Beedrill&#39;s STAB Attacks: Pokemon that can tank Beedrill&#39;s STAB attacks and recover the damage, such as Gligar and Crobat, make for good answers to Beedrill and are a pain for Beedrill to face. Tentacruel also resists both STAB moves and has decent Defense, but it is vulnerable to Drill Run and gets worn down fairly easily.</p>

<p>Physical Walls: Pokemon with high physical bulk like Alomomola and Suicune can tank Beedrill&#39;s STAB attacks and heal off the damage taken with Wish and Rest, respectively, while forcing Beedrill out due to the chance of a Scald burn.</p>

<p>Protect should be used the first turn Beedrill is sent out if the opposing Pokemon is faster, as it lets Beedrill safely Mega Evolve and attain the Speed boost without taking damage, scouting the foe&#39;s moveset in the process. Although it has poor defensive stats, Beedrill&#39;s decent defensive typing gives it 4x resistances it can use to switch in. However, some powerful physical moves such as Mienshao&#39;s Reckless High Jump Kick have a shot at 2HKOing it, although Beedrill can use Protect to scout and potentially make Mienshao take crash damage. Beedrill can grab momentum with little trouble thanks to its strong U-turn and high Speed stat, so pairing it with entry hazard users is a good idea. Keeping entry hazards off your side of the field is appreciated, as Beedrill will be switching out more than often due to U-turn and can be KOed by priority users after Stealth Rock damage.</p>

Religion is 3rd dimensional thinking. No man can be the gatekeeper for the Creator. Every religion has lied to us. I was a cross wearing Christian because I was told about pagan things like wearing the Egyptian cross. And the trinity bullshit. They didn&#39;t tell me Jesus was hung from a tree. I use to think we were here on a small speck in the cosmos because we are insignificant. They didn&#39;t tell me YAHUWA made us the center of the universe. They didn&#39;t tell me who the Hebrews really are. I was made to worship a false image of the Messiah and to hate myself, I was made to feel worthless in your Egyptian land, descendant of slaves. I was told and show over and over how worthless I was over and over. It was just shut the fuck up and know your place nigger. If they church told me who I really was, perhaps I would not have hated myself for almost my entire life.</p>

<p>I ask this because I&#39;m a direct descendent from an indigenous ancient middle eastern civilisation that has a history that surpasses the Hebrews and Egyptians and a bloodline that has the least amount of mixing amongst the entire Middle East. We are not black, I&#39;ve seen Black Hebrews claim our ancestors are black when genetic testing and one of the most widely recorded histories in this world show clearly our ancestors were never black. </p>

<p>Not that I think colour matters, but it&#39;s ridiculous when people want to claim others history as theirs. Everyone wants to feel like they are the chosen race, enlightened and elevated by Dieties, this has been the case since the beginning of time. </p>

 evolution teaches us that survival of the fittest right. how long can you stay on the beach in the summer before you get a sunburn? lets reframe that question, how long would you be able to work on the fields or hunt outdoors under a burning sun? 
 and dont say that white evolved because of cooler climates in the north. if that was true then the Eskimos would all be blond and blue eyed ( they have shorter arms and legs to preserve heat, they are built for cooler climates ) </p>

<p>you cant look at people today and say ohh gee i bet they looked like that a couple of thousand years ago. and if we say that most of the ancient where black, then where did white come from? the answer is in the runes boy.. learn a litel bit about the runes cus they are thousand of years older then Odin and his viking death cult  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No it&#39;s not. Why choose longitude, date (but not month), hour (in 24-hr notation) and minute to go with deaths? There are literally a million things you can scout around for. The problem is that a particular tragedy like this will spit out a 1000 statistics. Number of police. Age of people dying. Ariana&#39;s N<sup>th</sup> concert. The N<sup>th</sup> parliament. Manchester is the 2nd largest city (2 again!). It&#39;s been N months since the last terror incident. And so on and so forth. Literally hundreds of things to dig up. The fact that these 4 or 5 statistics line up is <em>meaningless.</em> The human brain is wired and often desperate to seek out connections where none exist. Notice that these random connections are never the same across different events. You&#39;ve got 5-6 coincidental things about this attack but 5-6 <em>different</em> things about some other attack (such as 9/11). </p>

<p>Interestingly, several eye witnesses on Utøya reported seeing more than one gunman. This was reported by every major MSM outlet in Norway following the attack (and the articles were still online the last time I checked). But it didn&#39;t take long for the police to go with the fabricated solo terrorist narrative. </p>

<p>Behring Breivik is coincidentally also the son of a high-ranking, shady diplomat associated with the Norwegian Labour party. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>eep your comment has 22 points =/</p>

<p>So I noticed something similar after the disappearance of flight 370 when the 37&#39;s started piling up. </p>

<p>Even though I only mentioned it originally in passing and didn&#39;t put too much weight on it, <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/axolotl_peyotl/comments/21rpeg/so_my_high_octane_speculation_about_the/">it somehow was picked up by Time.com and then mentioned on the Colbert Report</a> which was just bizarre. </p>

<p>When I heard that 22 people reported to have died, I automatically had a feeling it must&#39;ve been on the 22nd of the month (I had to check...I didn&#39;t remember the date briefly). I then thought to myself that there probably was going to be one male perpetrator, and I would be surprised if he <em>wasn&#39;t</em> 22 (I shit you not).</p>

<p>There&#39;s a pattern to these things. These are rituals.</p>

<p>Like 9/11, <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/axolotl_peyotl/comments/21roh5/911_aleister_crowley_and_nefarious_numerology_was/">these numbers are ritualistic in natural and riddled with occult significance.</a></p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t matter if you don&#39;t believe in it, <em>they</em> do. It&#39;s a signature.</p>

<p>If more (or less) than 22 people end up dying as a result of this, it still doesn&#39;t matter...what matters is what is reported. </p>

<p>I agree completely. Fascinating stuff.</p>

<p>Berlin Christmas Market Attack on 12/19/2016: (1 + 2 + 1 + 9 + 2 + 1 + 6 = 22)</p>

<p>Brussels Bombings were on 3/22/2016</p>

<p>2005 Tentena market bombings in Indonesia kill 22 on 5/28/2005: (5 + 2 + 8 + 2 + 5 = 22)</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure there&#39;s more.  </p>

Royals consider themselves decenedants of the gods. That was their belief not mine and though it is not widely accepted anymore. I suspect the elites of the old bloodlines still hold the belief that they are descendant of the gods.
