<p>If my evidence is required to be given in the United States I would be prepared to do so if appropriate arrangements are made. <strong>I would need a guarantee from Special Counsel Mueller, on behalf of the United States, of safe passage from New Zealand to the United States and back.</strong> In the coming days we will be communicating with the appropriate authorities to make the necessary arrangements. <strong>In the meantime, I will make no further comment.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Every time someone helps us, people jump on this sub and shit on them. Why is that? Is it helpful to shit on people even if they help us a little? Who gives a shit about his business model. That dude&#39;s been making money like that for a long time. What do you expect? Should he shut down his business and then give info on Seth Rich? Why would he do that? I guess one reason would be so people won&#39;t talk shit about him. </p>

<p>You guys need to start thanking our allies instead of shitting on them. Its not a big deal if you have to go on his website to hear some news on Seth Rich. He might made a few extra sales. What&#39;s the big deal? He needs money just like the rest of us. If you are going to criticize him, criticize him on whether he is being truthful or not but don&#39;t just make claims without any evidence. People come around here thinking they are smart to call people shills yet they have no evidence outside of their own gut instinct and those people are typically projecting themselves onto others. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It will not matter how long we have to wait. IF the evidence is as damning as everyone keeps saying it is....it will be up to TPTB to release it. </p>

<p>Just my opinion...but by him going through lawyers and the official chain of command, the only thing he is doing is handing the evidence over &amp; (if it exists) ruining the oportunity for all of us to know the truth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe, he doesn&#39;t have evidence and intentionally created a lose lose situation for anyone interested in the truth.</p>

<p>He gave himself convenient excuses not to release it. He gave himself an impossible condition to even release it. Safe passage? For what, allegations that the entire commission would already know is bullshit? </p>

<p>If the commission has evidence it was for sure the Russian hackers, then there&#39;s no reason for them to play ball with Kim (because it&#39;s obviously a media play for more damage.) The only way they&#39;d grant him safe passage is if they don&#39;t have evidence that suggests it was Russian Hackers, which the intelligence agencies are on the record saying they have. So ask yourself, if he wanted to get the truth out, would he A) make the only possible condition for releasing the info be contingent on the intelligence communities publicly admitting they had incorrect info? or B) Release the info.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a fuckin&#39; scam of some kind... Until there&#39;s a release, it looks like a fuckin&#39; scam.</p>

<p>For wikileaks, it makes sense to drop a file password protected for a later release.  However, at some point, they upped the game from that, into the &#39;hype game&#39;, where they built more hype than they could deliver.  Now Kim is doing the same - and he has been since last year.   I&#39;m not sure if he gets a high from it, or what, but if you have information, you release it immediately, and if you aren&#39;t ready to release it, you don&#39;t tell people you have it until you are ready.  The way this is happening, it seems...idk, more like roleplay than a real release.</p>

<p>This Hollywood-like hype does nothing to <em>bring justice</em> or <em>harm the criminals</em>. It <em>does</em>:<br/>
1. Tip off the bad guys.<br/>
2. Give them time to implement disclaimers or diversionary statements.<br/>

<p>There is a huge difference between &#39;Kim doesn&#39;t have the evidence&#39; vs &#39;Kim probably has the evidence and is using the situation to best further himself as well as making a political impact&#39;.</p>

<p>Seth could release anything he wants to. He is an attention whore who dragged this on for days to basically say nothing.</p>

<p>He used the donald and people investigating seth to get attention and clicks.</p>

<p>And, as usual, those people fell for it because they wanted to believe, and people on the outside looking in telling people it was all BS were called shills, etc.</p>

<p>Maybe if more &#39;investigators&#39; online would look for the actual truth and not just for biased info they want to be real they would actually get to the truth once in awhile.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the thing, and let&#39;s make sure we have the story right:</p>

<p>1) He claimed to have spoken directly with Seth, while he was alive.</p>

<p>2) That means that he has spent the last year sitting on this not saying anything, even though it potentially is a damning political bombshell.</p>

<p>3) Coincidentally, as the white house is going through the actual justice process for investigation into the claims of Russian interference, he publicly admits to having this. </p>

<hr/>

<p>What are we supposed to think? Seems to me that this whole mess is some kind of ridiculous setup that&#39;s all about mocking the political process. These people HATE the fucking republicans (and the Dems), but HATE republicans. That doesn&#39;t change just because Trump is in office. This is the party of the patriot act. This is the party of FISA courts... It&#39;s fuckin&#39; bait. They are getting the entire republican base getting fired up over the most ridiculous shit, and we&#39;re going to have to put up with the fallout in this country where a large chunk of the populace believes that kim fuckin&#39; dotcom is the reason why the Democratic party still exists. It&#39;s going to be retarded.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Assange has also previously made statements that the main reason he refuses to be forcefully extradited to the United States is due to the fact that the government will place him in front of a private court (which will be the furthest from impartial) as opposed to a public court with a relatively impartial jury.

<p>But it&#39;s clear that the United States government would rather, &quot;kidnap&quot; him from the embassy and force him to face a private court anyway. So to be quite honest, I don&#39;t really blame him for avoiding leaving the embassy, given the circumstances. </p>

<p>The DNC has been completely reasonable in this case. It&#39;s literally just conspiracy theorists trying <em>desperately</em> to find something weird about it because it would fit their narrative.</p>

<p>&quot;Parading this for gun control&quot; --&gt; Done. Hillary Clinton mentioned him.</p>

<p>&quot;Demanding investigations&quot; --&gt; Why the hell? It was a botched robbery. Literally all the facts point to that. The neighboorhood where he was had an active gang who robbed people days before he was there.</p>

<p>It&#39;s hilarious that people seriously think he was &quot;assasinated&quot;. Appaarently the DNC is this super awesome crime syndicate that can murder people (no motive to murder Seth Rich either after he already leaked) and then cover it up, but the &quot;assassins&quot; they hire <em>can&#39;t even assasinate him properly</em>.</p>

<p>Literally everything about the &quot;Seth Rich was assassinated&quot; narrative is utter bullshit. There&#39;s no motive, no clues and it fucking does not look like an &quot;assassination&quot;. Nice assassins, shooting a guy twice and then running away <em>while he&#39;s still alive</em>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Literally everything you just wrote is wrong.  There is no evidence for your side (what was robbed? Where are the security camera videos? Where are the body camera videos?  Why is the police report so empty? Why does wikileaks basically say that he was the source of the leak? Why is the DNC warding off investigators? Why did the DNC put a crisis manager in as the family spokesman?) but mounting evidence for a sloppy assassination and cover up.</p>

<p>None of the above questions are reasonably answerable unless you shift your incorrect assertions and admit he was assassinated. Nice troll post though. </p>

Wheeler instead said he only learned about the possible existence of such evidence through the reporter he spoke to for the FoxNews.com story. </p>

<p><strong>He explained that the comments he made to WTTG-TV were intended to simply preview Fox News&#39; Tuesday story.</strong> The WTTG-TV news director did not respond to multiple requests for comment.
<strong>&quot;I only got that [information] from the reporter at Fox News,&quot; Wheeler told CNN.</strong></p>

<p>Asked about a quote attributed to him in the Fox News story in which he said his &quot;investigation up to this point shows there was some degree of email exchange between Seth Rich and Wikileaks,&quot; Wheeler said he was referring to information that had already been reported in the media.</p>

<p>Ten years of reddit gold says he doesn&#39;t. He has <strong>multiple</strong> charges against him here in America that he&#39;s been avoiding extradition on, he knows for a fact he won&#39;t get immunity just to come testify about something the FBI isn&#39;t even investigating. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fox News has been doing this a lot lately.  They clearly ran with this story to distract from a story that ran only hours beforehand about the Trump/Russia investigation. Even Wheeler, who initially broke the story to Fox News, later said he was just saying what FN told him to say.  Right before the election Bret Baier ran a story about Hillary&#39;s email server being breached only to retract it after a night of hyping it.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>KDC was screwed over by the TPTB, this is why he is looking to leverage into this into &quot;safe passage&quot; to the USA. If he steps on US soil he is likely to be murdered, kidnapped, thrown in prison, taken to a dark site or who knows what else.</p>

<p>Remember that TPTB, in his case the people who are copyright owners (RIAA, MPAA et. al.) had enough influence in our own government that they pushed the NZ government to seize his assets, steal his money, shut down his operation etc. Look up the history of Megaupload.</p>

<p>That being said, I have no idea what he has exactly if he has anything or if he is just playing games or looking for a deal.</p>
