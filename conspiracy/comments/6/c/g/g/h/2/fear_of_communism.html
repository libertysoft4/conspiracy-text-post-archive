        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It&#39;s become apparent to me that people conflate communism with authoritarianism. Communism has never been enacted by the people. The people (you and me who aren&#39;t rich) should control the means of production and share in that wealth. Not someone gets super fucking rich and pays us shit. This is an incredibly simplified version of what communism is, but wouldn&#39;t you rather work and get your fair share of the pie instead of having a boss who can (and will) fire you the second you stop being profitable to his business? I guess I&#39;m just confused as to why communism is always conflated with authoritarianism when the two are not even compatible. Yes the USSR was a shit hole, but for fucks sake, it was because the elite took control of the country. It&#39;s pretty obvious why we are brainwashed into believing that communism is always bad. It&#39;s because the rich can&#39;t get any richer if we were truly to form a party of the people for the people. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I always try to explain communism in a way that isn&#39;t really even communism.  I try to indoctrinate my coworkers, my friends, my wife, random police officers who are beating me and searching my car, librarians, old men and women on a train, people at bus stops. I tell them that if you work 40 hours a week, you deserve the basic necessities of life.. a home, food, water, education for yourself and your children, healthcare, a basic vehicle for transportation..  I say that no one should be allowed to attain wealth so massive that one cannot spend it in a lifetime, ESPECIALLY while families.. WORKING FAMILIES AT THAT.. starve, become sick, experience all types of depravity induced by poverty.. addiction, sick twisted sexual issues..etc.     I tell them that the world is sick.. i ask them to imagine a couple of men and women sitting in an apartment, writing on a sheet of paper the foundations of a better world, a reasonable, realistic plan for a perfect situation of living.  How much wealth is enough? What negative things happen when wealth is capped?  How do we deal with counter revolutionaries? How do we limit useless items, and instead focus on a colorful array of necessities?  How, like the windmill in George Orwells ANIMAL FARM, can we poor our collective intelligence to advance AND DIRECT technology to work for all? In order to build limitless homes, grow limitless food, increase efficiency in the rapid development of a singularity of peace and happiness and meaning?   How do we remove competition, but increase motivation to innovate at the same time? How do you get the maximum of the population to care about one goal, being the realization and manifestation of a singular best possible endgame scenario for humanity?  How do we get to a point where the planets inhabitants are actively choosing a path forward? Where do we want to be in 50 years? 500? 50,000 years?  These are some of the least impossible things I can imagine..  I wouldn&#39;t have any clue how to build a computer chip, a television, or a cell phone network from scratch.. but I CAN imagine a better world.   Violence should be universally seen as a negative.. so what&#39;s a positive? In a society, there are rules, in the universe there are rules.. such as.. people need food water and shelter,  AND there is an expectation that you should earn your food water and shelter.  That&#39;s great,  but the food water and shelter are already yours.  The iron ore is yours.  Same with the natural gas and the gold and the steel and the oil.. it&#39;s natural resources that we allowed to be OWNED by single interests, to the detriment of ourselves... it&#39;s not FREE SHIT when it&#39;s the people&#39;s resources to begin with.. fuck your business contracts and your investment portfolio.. people are literally suffering.. good, working, people...     I TRULY BELIEVE THAT THE IDEAS BEHIND COMMUNISM ARE THE BIGGEST THREAT TO ALL THOSE WHO OPPOSE THE DEVELOPMENT OF A BETTER WORLD. It&#39;s why we had to slander it so harshly, with billions of dollars of propaganda, with the continuing violence against it and the anger it brings out of the selfish, and/or uninformed, and/or unimaginative.    I love you for being what I call normal and realistic,  and what others call crazy and ridiculously utopian.   Dream on brother and may your dreams become concrete next time the people have had enough struggling. Peace land and bread for all! </p>

<p>You said this, but you could literally replace communism with capitalism here and it would still be correct. Capitalism <strong><em>requires</em></strong> violent enforcement of property rights to function, otherwise any group of yahoos with guns can take over your farm/mine/factory/whatever.</p>

<p>Or do you think the cops side with factory workers when they decide to strike and picket? Do you not think that, in the case of a strike, their function is to prevent the workers from entering and assuming control? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely. There&#39;d be a huge opportunity for someone to open up an identical factory with less aggregious methods of employment.

<p>1) This isn&#39;t what socialism is. </p>

<p>2) It&#39;s fucking retarded to think that any member of <em>any ruling class ever</em> would willingly cede power. Do you think democracy itself was willfully given? Hmmm. </p>

<p>3) It&#39;s ridiculous that you just sidestep <a href="/u/notjaker44">/u/notjaker44</a>&#39;s mention of all these coups, like, you do realize that the sample size of successful socialist states is <em>directly impacted by this</em>, yeah? Maybe <em>as merely one example</em> Chile would have seen a bit more success had we not sanctioned the fuck out of them, funded actual terrorist groups, and poured hundreds of millions of dollars into anti-Allende propaganda i.e. vis a vis <em>El Mercurio</em>? </p>

<p>We literally OKed the assassination of right-wing constitutionalist General Rene Schneider because he insisted on remaining apolitical, as the Chilean military had always been, stating that he would defend the constitution to the death. But yeah, socialism &quot;just doesn&#39;t work,&quot; yup. If you don&#39;t see the Chilean coup for what it was- the United States engaging in imperialism abroad to protect capitalist profits- then there&#39;s something <em>deeply</em> wrong with you, especially given that you&#39;re here in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> where you&#39;re ostensibly one who questions &quot;official&quot; narratives. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Maybe you do it because your employer pockets 70% of the value of your labor, you pay another 10% in taxes, and the precious little which remains gets eaten up by ever-increasing rent/food/healthcare costs? Hmmm</p>

<p>BTW, here&#39;s an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marinaleda">example of extremely successful communism</a>, but I already know your &quot;brilliant&quot; retort- that it &quot;works on a small scale, but falls apart when you scale it up,&quot; completely fucking ignoring that the CIA <strong><em>actively engages in dismantling every single large scale socialist endeavor</em></strong>. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>Marinaleda expropriated most of their agricultural land, read the article. &quot;Rich guy sharing his wealth&quot; isn&#39;t what socialism is, socialism is the communal ownership of the means of production. I used them as an example because you continuously demand &quot;an example where it works&quot; i.e. with your comment here:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>With many countries and individuals espousing communism in the world and yet you have not one example of it in practice...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s an example of it not only in practice, but actually in practice <em>as Marx envisioned</em> rather than with a centralized state bureaucracy such as the USSR&#39;s, as well as an example of it being wildly successful (in comparison to neighboring regions). </p>

<blockquote>
<p>2) So, this is happening by force? Guess there will be some leaders. Oh shit, &quot;It&#39;s fucking retarded to think that any member of any ruling class ever would willingly cede power.&quot; Guess we&#39;re back to square one.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Do you think the bourgeoisie will allow the working class to elect them out of power? I sure would love for a peaceful exchange of power, but you&#39;re kidding yourself if you think tyrants would willingly cede the throne, or that use of violence is somehow an inherent immorality given the obvious necessity for violence in establishing democratic rule in the first place. Would you have fought for the throne in the American Revolution? </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>This analogy isn&#39;t really accurate, it&#39;s more akin to you saying internal combustion engines &quot;just don&#39;t work&quot; if I were to hire a group of goons to smash up all your prototypes every time you attempted to build one. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>And what&#39;s wrong with small-scale? I think you might have contradicted your only valid point.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nothing at all, but &quot;well you can&#39;t scale it up!&quot; is an <em>incredibly</em> common response from people like yourself, and it&#39;s important to point out that when it <em>is</em> scaled up entities such as the CIA <em>always</em> interfere. </p>

<p>p.s. I really don&#39;t understand why you&#39;re focused on this &quot;One rich guy can support communism&quot; thing, when it has nothing to do with anything. Would you argue that democracy does not work if there were no kings willing to give up their thrones? </p>

<p>You don&#39;t try to help Cuba or head over to Vietnam  </p>

<p>Because it&#39;s so easy to leave for and assimilate into a society in which one does not speak the native language.

Yes, I guess I could go to Cuba, and leave my fellow Americans to the wolves, to continue to be brainwashed and enslaved...</p>

<p>I mean, would you go back in time to the apex of the labor movement, with all the strikes, riots, and massacres which won (for most) the 8-hour workday, and tell all those involved that they should just pack it up and make their own country? </p>

<p>Even if every likeminded person were magically transported to an area where there were actually enough land and resources for this to be feasible to do, there are many Marxist schools of thought which argue that single-state Socialism is impossible. This was one of the main reasons for Trotsky&#39;s exile, because he argued against Stalin&#39;s single-state socialism. </p>

<p>I agree with Trotsky, because there will always be external capitalist forces seeking to take advantage of or privatize the assets of any prospective communist nation. The only way to prevent this would be totally closed borders, which as you can see from history doesn&#39;t exactly work out well. If you support free trade, you should understand that economic isolation isn&#39;t exactly beneficial to those in isolation. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>(they did, but dumbass you are their support, so all this tells you is that the evil is greater than the good). </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;re saying I don&#39;t get it, but you don&#39;t seem to realize that the level of available support differs between the capitalist class which owns almost everything and the working class which owns almost nothing. How am I to provide support greater than that which the CIA can provide? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Communism is literally, by definition, a stateless, classless, money-less society <em>theorized</em> to follow in the footsteps of socialism. You&#39;re confusing communism with stare capitalism (meaning &quot;socialism&quot; where all capital is held by the state, essentially making ranking party members the &quot;new capitalists&quot; i.e. USSR/China pre-economic liberalization).</p>

<p>There are a lot of people who advocate socialized ownership of the means of production but <em>decentralized</em> and democratic government i.e. libertarian socialists, anarcho-syndicalists, etc </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Communism has almost always been implemented by formerly oppressed people through a violent revolution.

    <div class="md"><p>I think people who are afraid for their lives and futures are vulnerable to the appeal of strongmen, and the revolutionary/post-revolution period provide the opportunity for these types to take power. <em>Especially</em> when various counter-revolutionary forces seek to terrorize the new state, necessitating the suspension of various rights to protect the nascent socialist state, which in turn facilitates the power grabs by these strong men. </p>

<p>IMO the USSR would have turned out quite differently had Stalin not subsumed the power of the Soviets (worker councils) since they were the real democratic force.</p>

<p>Also a lot of people see the potential for AI/computing to facilitate the management oh a communist economy, and iirc that&#39;s one of the things Allende wanted to do in Chile before we Freedom&#39;d the fuck out of them (installing Pinochet in the process) by it would have been very rudimentary compared to what we could do now. </p>

<p>And yes, I mostly blame Stalin for the bad name of communism today. I think some form of communism is inevitable if society keeps progressing the way it is.

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>pay someone an agreeable amount that makes both parties happy(captialism)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This isn&#39;t capitalism, this is trade. Capitalism would be you <em>personally</em> owning the land used to produce these vegetables, likely paying a wage-laborer to do the labor for you as you pocket the profit, only paying the laborer a small portion of the value his work created. </p>

<p>Socialism would involve the communal ownership of this land, with its use to be decided democratically by the community. If there&#39;s a plot of land and 99/100 people want to use it for something else, but you want to grow crops, then there would be a problem... but it&#39;s not like you&#39;re any more free to grow crops on someone else&#39;s private property as it is. </p>

<p>Not all forms of socialism are the same as the Stalinist &quot;go here, do this- or choose between gulag and bullet&quot; stuff people tend to think of. </p>

<p>p.s. Two of my favorite Kropotkin quotes from <em>The Conquest of Bread</em> deal with this</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;We cry shame on the feudal baron who forbade the peasant to turn a clod of earth unless he surrendered to his lord a fourth of his crop. We called those the barbarous times. But if the forms have changed, the relations have remained the same, and the worker is forced, under the name of free contract, to accept feudal obligations. For, turn where he will, he can find no better conditions. Everything has become private property, and he must accept, or die of hunger.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“In virtue of this monstrous system, the son of the worker, on entering life, finds no field which he may till, no machine which he may tend, no mine in which he may dig, without accepting to leave a great part of what he will produce to a master. He must sell his labour for a scant and uncertain wage. His father and his grandfather have toiled to drain this field, to build this mill, to perfect this machine. They gave to the work the full measure of their strength, and what more could they give?”</p>
</blockquote>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok so it&#39;s only slightly less oppressive. Gotcha. So I guess I&#39;ll update my scenario: what if I wanted to pay the community an agreeable sum to buy a piece of land myself, so that I can farm it, because I believe my needs aren&#39;t sufficiently provided for?

    <div class="md"><p>Remember when I said </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The only &quot;different&quot; idea that would absolutely cause it to fall apart would be if somebody wanted to bring back capitalism i.e. what almost all counter-revolutionary forces in socialist countries sought to achieve.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s literally what I&#39;m talking about. You&#39;re describing purchasing capital i.e. the land in question (which shouldn&#39;t even be &quot;for sale&quot; since the whole point of socialism is the social ownership of the means of production) and allowing you to own and accumulate capital both defeats the purpose of socialism and plants the seed for a counter-revolution. You buy one plot of land, and then another, and then another, and then another, and when you&#39;re the largest land-owner in your community... do you not think you would hold any more power than others in your community, who own no land? </p>

<p>If you want to farm for yourself, that&#39;s between you and your community. If you want to <em>own the land</em> then you are jeopardizing the entire system. </p>

<p>p.s. Marxist thought distinguishes between private and personal property, so there is a distinction to be made. Are you buying more land than you can use, to potentially hire laborers to work on your behalf? That&#39;s private property. Are you <em>temporarily owning</em> land for <em>your own personal use</em>? That&#39;s personal property. </p>

<p>Owning a house to rent to others = private property</p>

<p>Owning a house because it&#39;s been in your family for generations and you&#39;re actively using it as your home = personal property </p>

<p>Maybe in the USSR/China, where material circumstances led to the sort of central state authoritarianism you&#39;re describing, but like I said, that isn&#39;t necessarily what socialism must be. Everything could be managed and owned democratically, which isn&#39;t perfect (since people aren&#39;t perfect) but it&#39;s not like you can go against the wishes of your community (breaking laws) as it is under capitalism.  The bourgeois state makes the rules, and if you don&#39;t like it you can deal with the cops. </p>

<p>There are current examples of socialism functioning very well, i.e. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marinaleda">Marinaleda, Spain</a>, so it&#39;s not like it&#39;s impossible. I know that there are many more examples of its <em>failure</em>, but I would like to point out that almost universally the CIA has had a great deal of involvement with these failures (i.e. Guatemala in 1953, Iran in 1954, Chile in 1973, Nicaragua with the Sandinistas, etc. I would even argue that the USSR and China might have turned out differently had there been global cooperation rather than an arms race between belligerents).</p>

<p>If you wanted to &quot;open up a farm,&quot; you could do so- you would just need democratic support from your community. And why shouldn&#39;t you? It&#39;s not your land, it is everyone&#39;s land.</p>

<p>Please re-read and think about those Kropotkin quotes in my other posts, and envision a world where <em>everything</em> is private property (it shouldn&#39;t be hard- it&#39;s our world). You&#39;re no more free to do as you please under capitalism, because you would still need to labor for another (giving up the majority of the value of your work!) for a wage to save to accrue capital to buy your land. Is this not fundamentally identical to indentured servitude? You, with no capital, must labor for those who possess it in order to <em>maybe</em> buy your freedom. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>or if I thought I should be paid more for doing more work, etc.</p>

<p>The whole idea is that under capitalism <strong><em>you are not paid what your labor is worth</em></strong>. If you were, then your employer would receive no profit, defeating the whole point of the system. If your labor creates, in a day, $200 of value, and you&#39;re paid only 80 (and must pay taxes on that 80!) then you are obviously not receiving your due compensation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What&#39;s insane, is the new breed of pseudo right wing rural conspiracy theorists, who conflate communism with &quot;Obama&quot; and &quot;liberals&quot; and have no grasp of what it means, and how amazing of a system it would be ESPECIALLY FOR THEM. It&#39;s literally made for them and they are so wildly uninformed that they advocate against it violently. Communism must be the most widely used term, in the wrong way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the concept of communism is broken from the start. the workers should NOT directly control the means of production. some people are more able than others. some people want more than others and are willing to do more to get it. </p>

<p>Here is an example that i just made up...</p>

<p>Say Jimmy invents a machine to stamp license plates better and more effeciently than any other that exists with the simple push of a button, it takes 10 years of his life and a million dollars to build the prototype and start producing them. </p>

<p>A different guy, Billy has a unique business plan and the skills required to implement it, and decided to go into the licence plate stamping business. He takes out a 5 million dollar loan to get the business going, buys 3 of Jimmy&#39;s machines (at say $500k each) and a building to run the business from. </p>

<p>he hires workers to push the buttons on the super easy to use machines, his business plan works out great and he is the most successful licence plate stamper in the world.</p>

<p>explain to me what the workers did to earn as much (or more cumulatively) than Jimmy or Billy. They both invested huge chunks of money, and chunks of their lives to make the thing happen. the workers pushed buttons.</p>

<p>p.s.
there is no such thing as a &quot;fair share&quot; because someone will always have to dictate what is fair to those who believe that they earned more. Every system needs a force to dictate who gets what. It is better to have a central authority do it, or the power of the market (i.e all of the workers collectively spending their money)? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Considering the word has been vilified and bastardized over the decades it is no wonder people fear it... or what it has come to be identified with. </p>

<p>The Soviets had summer homes for politicians and hickey players.  No commie. China...? Plenty of perks for the rich... the rich... not commie. </p>

<p>There was a movie in the 80s Jon Cryer Hiding Out where he goes back to high school to hide from the mob. In his socials class the teacher wrote on the board &quot;communism vs democracy.&quot; </p>

<p>Fitting. They are not mutually exclusive and a true ideal communist state would <em>have</em> to be completely democratic. On the other side of the coin a complete capitalistic state would not be democratic. Oligarchies never end well. </p>

<p>To quote a dicumentary i sae on royalty and religion once: True power is mandated by the masses!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here we go again with the &quot;it just ain&#39;t been done by the right people&quot; BS again. Look, any time you hand over that much power to a central government the central government will be infiltrated by &quot;the wrong people&quot; again. The real goal is provide the individual with as much Liberty and autonomy as possible and create a government devoted to those ends. Communism and socialism are both completely at odds with the individual and therefore are inherently suspect.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think people who are afraid for their lives and futures are vulnerable to the appeal of strongmen, and the revolutionary/post-revolution period provide the opportunity for these types to take power. <em>Especially</em> when various counter-revolutionary forces seek to terrorize the new state, necessitating the suspension of various rights to protect the nascent socialist state, which in turn facilitates the power grabs by these strong men. </p>

<p>IMO the USSR would have turned out quite differently had Stalin not subsumed the power of the Soviets (worker councils) since they were the real democratic force.</p>

<p>Also a lot of people see the potential for AI/computing to facilitate the management oh a communist economy, and iirc that&#39;s one of the things Allende wanted to do in Chile before we Freedom&#39;d the fuck out of them (installing Pinochet in the process) by it would have been very rudimentary compared to what we could do now. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s hoping we can somehow enact socialism peacefully, but I don&#39;t see the bourgeoisie giving it up without a fight, and the petite bourgeoisie will always muddy the waters like this is about them. </p>
