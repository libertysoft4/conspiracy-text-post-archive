<p>I distinctly remember during the election even <a href="/r/Wikileaks">/r/Wikileaks</a> was like WTF is going on with their twitter.. </p>

<p>Anyway, yea.. the leaks maybe 100% accurate.. but, they use that image to peddle a bunch of B.S. via twitter like &#39;implying&#39; Seth Rich was murdered without actually saying so (because they know it&#39;s not true).</p>

<p>If they had proof that Seth Rich was the leaker, WHY NOT JUST FUCKING LEAK IT TOO?! The argument i&#39;ve seen so far is &quot;nobody will trust them after&quot;... but.. cmon, if you were MURDERED for leaking, wouldn&#39;t you want Assange to tell the cops why so they could launch a proper investigation?</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Assange said, ““Whistleblowers go to significant efforts to get us material, often very significant risks. There’s a 27-year-old that works for the DNC who was shot in the back, murdered, just two weeks ago, for unknown reasons as he was walking down the street in Washington.” </p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://heavyeditorial.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/assange.jpg?quality=65&amp;strip=all&amp;w=780">What has Assange himself said on the Rich matter? He retweeted the Fox  5 article saying Wikileaks and Seth Rich had been in contact hours after it aired</a></p>

<p>It appears that there was more than 1 individual involved in leaking this info, T_D and /pol/ users have already identified others who were likely working with Seth (if he was in fact the leaker).</p>

<p>If there was confirmation from wikileakd that Seth was the source, it would implicate these other people and put them in danger.</p>

<p>Most people I talk to are pretty sure that Seth Rich is the leaker. Most people I talk to are also convinced that Wikileaks was compromised back in October 2016.</p>

<p>As for me, I try to keep an open mind. The Seth Rich story makes more sense than muh Russian Hackers. Hopefully we&#39;ll get a resolution to these narratives soon and any evidence that is being held back will be released to the public. </p>

<p>Not really, for the reasons I previously outlined for you already. If he did prove it, <strong>would you believe him?</strong> The entire fucking premise of your original post is that Assange is deceitful.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s an old account saying that the Rich story does not hold up the way people here are absolutely sure that it does. </p>

<p>In my view anyway. Even the people involved don&#39;t say anything to back up the idea that he was the leaker. Most of the commentary here starts from the premise that Rich was the leak, then jumps into how awful John Podesta is and the other claptrap.</p>

<p>And if we&#39;re talking about suspicious accounts (sigh), what about the inflow from t_d posting Seth Rich stories and old Clinton dirt?</p>

<p>No, I am just reading what he has claimed and knowing that he is only releasing material (which is accurate mind you) that helps his narrative. Julian Assange is not a fan of leaks and information that does not fit his narrative, i.e. his response to the Panama Papers. If that was the 3rd largest law firm in the world doing that, makes you wonder what the largest 2 are doing, and everyone in the top 10, top 50, and etc.</p>

<p>No &quot;but...&quot;, the leaks are all that matter, and they&#39;ve been 100% accurate over 10 years across millions of documents.

<p>Think Julian is a jackass? Cool. Doesn&#39;t matter so long as his product is sound. The guy who owns the company that made your car is probably a jackass too, but so long as that car is safe and functional as advertised, who cares?</p>
