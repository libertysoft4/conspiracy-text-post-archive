</ul>

<p><strong>Why the DNC/Clinton&#39;s had nothing to do with Seth Rich&#39;s murder:</strong></p>

<p>(btw, I don&#39;t have any skin in this.  In fact, I am the one who broke the story that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/4x6l8m/the_clintons_have_gotten_to_seth_richs_parents/?st=j30mzbpi&amp;sh=e5041dae">Seth&#39;s parents were/are being silenced</a> by a DNC operative - Brad Bauman)</p>

<p>Per <a href="https://crimewatchdaily.com/2016/09/30/exclusive-murdered-dnc-staffers-family-friends-set-record-straight/">Crime Watch Daily with Chris Hansen:</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>&quot;The officers who were there and they said &#39;Yeah, he was quite talkative, he did not realize he had been shot,&#39;&quot; said Joel Rich, Seth&#39;s father.</em></p>

<p><em>But an hour and a half later at a nearby hospital, Seth was pronounced dead.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>That means after being shot Seth had contact with:</p>

<ol>
<li>The responding police.</li>
<li>The responding EMT&#39;s.</li>
<li>Hospital staff.</li>
</ol>

<p>So Seth could have talked to any people listed above about the attempted murder/30,000 emails on his computer.</p>

<p>That means the DNC/Clintons would have to immediately:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>know that Seth survived and so they would have to somehow make sure he was put to death in the hospital so he couldn&#39;t talk any more (this is probably the biggest flaw in the theory the DNC/Clintons had Seth killed).</p></li>
<li><p>know he was talkative (see link above).</p></li>
<li><p>know who the responding officers were so the DNC/Clintons could immediately silence them with threats/etc before they had a chance to talk about what Seth may have told the officers. </p></li>
<li><p>know who the emergency responders were so the DNC/Clintons could immediately silence them with threats/etc before they had a chance to talk  about what Seth may have told the EMT&#39;s.</p></li>
<li><p>know all the hospital staff were who had contact with so the DNC/Clintons could immediately silence them with threats/etc before they had a chance to talk  about what Seth may have told all of the hospital staff.</p></li>
<li><p>know who the detectives/FBI agents assigned to the case are so the DNC/Clintons could threaten/etc them to get access to Seth&#39;s laptop so the 30,000 emails could be erased.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>In summary, the DNC/Clinton&#39;s had nothing to do with Seth Rich&#39;s murder; it was a botched robbery.</p>

<p>Case closed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The simple idea that a center right political party while not in power can &amp; will assassinate people for &quot;revenge&quot; while announcing it on twitter and then intimidate every single person he was in contact with and the only news agency covering the &quot;truth&quot; happen to be republican affiliated networks shows how ridiculous it is. I mean what sort of shitty assassin gets close enough to tear the guys watch strap in some sort of bizarre struggle (once again why is an assassin getting into a fistfight) and then leave him alive without taking his wallet/watch to make it look like a mugging let alone using a non silenced pistol in a city with gunshot monitors. </p>

<p>And why if there really is a &quot;Clinton Body Count&quot; of over 200 people (I think that number is correct) and they got away with all of the murders; to your point - why hire such a shitty assassin in this instance?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are two claims that are being conflated. The first is was Seth Rich the source of the DNC emails. As far as I am aware, this is what is being claimed.   It is not contradictory to maintain that he was the source, but was still killed in a botched robbery, although it certainly casts doubt on that narrative.</p>

<p>What would be completely destroyed is the narrative that the hacks were done by a foreign entity? Then the question is going to be is the intelligence community incompetent or were they in on it. </p>

<p>Putting aside the anti-Russian rhetoric here, what is absurd about a political powerhouse being connected?  The notion that power-elites don&#39;t utilize assassination, or don&#39;t have mob connection or whatever is false. I am not saying this is what happened in this case, as there is no evidence, but I see no reason a priori to reject it. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>There are several things that are false in your statements. The first is that its only republican partisans or conspiracy theorists are pushing for this. The second is that conspiracy theories are not taken seriously.  In fact we know they are, there are academic works about how conspiracy theories make effective governing difficult domestically, and how proliferation of conspiracy theories in the Middle East is a problem for American foreign policy.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;anti russian rhetoric&quot; how is it anti russian rhetoric to use an actual political revenge assassination as a example? oh right because anything bad about russia is automatically propaganda even when you are only using them as an example. &quot;the notion that power-elites don&#39;t utilize assassinations&quot; when did i ever say that i said the exact opposite considering i gave an EXAMPLE of power elites using assassinations proving i believe they do happen, just the fact that they do use them doesn&#39;t mean every single person who dies that has political ties was an assassination especially if the theory is completely an utterly absurd it in its logic of &quot;elites use assasination sometimes thus it must be assasination&quot; </p>

<p>I think we are in agreement that the power-elites connected to the DNC could have people assassinated, but there is no evidence that they assassinated Seth Rich.</p>

<p>There is nothing logically absurd, psychologically uncomfortable for sure. </p>

<p>This would be a wrong inference to draw.  However the position that elites do use assassination therefore it is possible that this was an assassination is not a false inference. It is just not supported.</p>

<p>There is nothing absurd here. All you are presenting is an argument from incredulity.  Might as well wonder why the mob kills its own guys if it brings more attention to the organization.   </p>

<p>It is clear that the Clinton faction has the support of the deep state here. Other than the Comey blip prior the election, which seems to have been necessary to pacify the FBI internally, she has their full support. </p>

<p>The mob has plenty of leaks and it wasn&#39;t brought down.  Moreover, I beg to disagree about the government crackdown.  Obama&#39;s policy of locking up whistle blowers has had a chilling effect throughout. </p>

<p>The deep state refers to the permanent government bureaucrats, mostly employed in the intelligence sector, private contractors affiliated with the defense sector, and connections to organized crime. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYS647HTgks">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYS647HTgks</a></p>

<p>To support the allegations of organized crime connections there is the family jewels CIA memo:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>According to the Family Jewels documents released, members of the American mafia were involved in CIA attempts to assassinate Cuban leader Fidel Castro.[15] The documents showed that the CIA recruited Robert Maheu, an ex-FBI agent and aide to Howard Hughes in Las Vegas, to approach Johnny Roselli under the pretense of representing international corporations that wanted Castro dead due to lost gambling interests.[15] Roselli introduced Maheu to mobster leaders Sam Giancana and Santo Trafficante, Jr..[15] Supplied with six poison pills from the CIA, Gianacana and Trafficante tried unsuccessfully to have people place the poison in Castro&#39;s food.[1</p>

<p>I maintain the following.</p>

<p>Whether one is more authoritarian or not has no bearing on whether they are preferred by the deep state. </p>

<p>The deep state consists of many extra government bodies, like defense contractors and organized crime. </p>

<p>Clinton was preferred by the deep state. </p>

<p>There is no evidence that Rich was assassinated at this point.</p>

<p>If Rich was the leaker, that in itself might be enough to destroy the  DNC, as they were pushing the Russia angle. </p>

<p>Wait...what?   Liberalism  does not mean cutting back on government intervention in the American context.  Liberalism here is ill defined, and generally means something like, I care about social issues and want to help poor people.   It does not mean classical liberalism.  Moreover both parties, are neo-liberal in policies and viewpoints.   There is something called the Washington consensus.  I think we are living in the era where its becoming splintered, but the deep state is still committed to it. </p>

<p>Have you been following the recent allegations of corruption in DC police? </p>

<p>Did you know the owner of the bar he was in was visiting a private area of the whitehouse 5 days before his murder, and attended a local game with free tickets gifted from someone at the white house?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, the people surrounding the crime do all have connections to the DNC and SEIU (responding officer, bar owner, and medical staff). So the OP is claiming such thinking is ridiculous and far-fetched, when in reality it is exactly how inter-connected capitol hill is.

    <div class="md"><p>it wasnt suspicious at all whats suspicious is that the story was spread by pro corporate rag fox news 2 hours after the comey firing and the entire right wing media lit on fire with the story completely distracting from trump, the amount of &quot;connections&quot; that have to be assumed and then power given to the DNC to control people in this case shows how blatantly partisan and bullshit the whole thing is, </p>

<p>occam&#39;s razor: the sheer amount of assumptions about the DNC having nigh unlimited power in this theory pretty much disproves it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good post. 
Playing devil&#39;s advocate here, a gunshot would have likely had investigating officers regardless.  Being in power they could simply make sure the first officers on the scene was paid off or in on it beforehand. It&#39;s more likely he&#39;d tell them if he was going to tell anyone, that&#39;s not information the hospital staff would need know and likely wouldn&#39;t come up. </p>

<p>Also they say he was very talkative, meaning he was conscience enough to not be suffering massive blood loss right away.  Your chances of dying from blood loss decrease immensely once you&#39;ve made it to a hospital, yet he still died, in spite of being there for an hour.  I believe it was George Webb who reported that he was isolated to a single surgeon.  Again, this would have been planned ahead of time. </p>

<p>Sorry for formatting and lack of sources ahead of time, I&#39;m on mobile.  Thoughts and help sourcing would be appreciated.  I&#39;ll update more when I get home. </p>

They wouldn&#39;t have made any noise (The person on the phone with Seth says she heard voices). Plus, we know Podesta and the DCCC were also hacked.

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting scenario, though wouldn&#39;t say case closed.</p>

<p>This narrative would rely on the assumption that Seth Rich knew who the shooter was, or knew who sent the shooter, and that he would blab about his involvement in the leaks openly.</p>

<p>I doubt someone would send a postcard to their target saying &quot;Hi, we&#39;re onto you and we just sent a hitman your way, good luck! &lt;3&quot;. Nor would the hitman walk up and hand him his business card. It could have been a real mugging, it could have also been a hit disguised as a mugging. The &quot;botched&quot; part makes it suspicious. There were no eyewitnesses, so if they went through the trouble of shooting a man, one would expect at least a wallet taken.</p>

<p>Also, I can think of more reasons to <em>not</em> blab about being the source of a leaker to everyone you see than otherwise, even if you had a possibly fatal gunshot wound. If you consider Rich didn&#39;t even know he was shot, it&#39;s not far fetched to say he could have underestimated the severity of his situation and didn&#39;t feel the need to give a death bed confession.</p>

<p>I agree with the Kim Dotcom stuff though, I think he&#39;s just trying to stay relevant by clinging on to Wikileaks&#39; coattails. Put up or shut up, Kim.</p>

The police and emts know he&#39;s in bad shape and don&#39;t listen to a word he&#39;s saying because they heard the same story last week from the homeless dude they had to take the ER. </p>

<p>The hospital staff also reacts similarly, and Seth possibly thought he might make it. There was no death bed confession because he died suddenly of his injuries. </p>

<p>This is just as possible and doesn&#39;t involve paying anyone off. Seth may not have even known his killer, or even connected the dots that he was being taken out by the DNC. He knew he had heat on him, but that doesn&#39;t mean he fully understood what was happening in that moment, and again was shot and probably in shock.</p>

<p>This scenario is just as likely as anything you proposed and would explain why no one remembers anything eventful or was even told anything useful. Seth was dead possibly before he even fully realized what had just happened. </p>
