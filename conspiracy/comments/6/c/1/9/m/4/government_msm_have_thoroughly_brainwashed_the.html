        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The younger generations have been brainwashed completely:-</p>

<ul>
<li><p>the younger generations protest on behalf of the elites. By and large, the younger generations are pro-mass immigration, pro-bloated welfare state, pro-megacorps (they give a pass to Apple, Google and Facebook paying so little in taxes).  These companies work with the deep state (ARE the deep state) that spy on your every action online.  It&#39;s been documented and made fact that this happens (PRISM).  Younger generations: &quot;no problem!&quot;.  Everything here is pro-uniparty/deep state agenda! </p></li>
<li><p>the younger generations have swallowed the lie that there&#39;s a difference between one political party and another one.  They all vote for the uniparty, and argue amongst themselves.</p></li>
<li><p>they do NOT protest about high house prices, crappy wages, nor the enormous national debts being piled up (e.g. US has $20,000,000,000,000 in national debt, of which in 8 short years Obama added another $10,000,000,000,000) - yet these are massive issues that affect, and will affect, the younger generations significantly.  The older generations are robbing the young blind - all over the western world - with nary a protest from the young.  Stunningly successful brainwashing right there.</p></li>
<li><p>the younger generations have been successfully cowed by political correctness.  This is a key aspect to the brainwashing strategy.  If you are scared to voice any kind of dissenting opinion to the MSM favoured narrative, then you will be shamed.  Look at how youtube give a pass to SJW-type channels, but anything non-PC is demonetised as &quot;racist&quot; or &quot;sexist&quot; (definitions that are subject to change on a daily basis). </p></li>
<li><p>the younger generations feel it&#39;s a &quot;safe haven&quot; to have a liberal (in the modern sense of the word, not dictionary definition sense) outlook: they follow the idea that we have an unlimited number of sexes (not binary), they are anti-traditional family (it&#39;s patriarchal after all, right?), pro-modern feminist - all the templated ideas that universities churn out are swalled wholesale by younger generations without any scrutiny (they don&#39;t want to be shamed).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Good job deep state. You really did it.  You have an army of useful idiots to do your dirty work.  They will argue amongst themselves, while ALL of them defend the status quo, and NONE protest real issues that affect them.  Bravo.</p>

<p>Before anyone comments, the above is a generalisation.  Please don&#39;t give me personal anecdotes about how you are young and see through all the propaganda.  I get it.  I&#39;m talking about the masses of younger generations who don&#39;t see through it. If I&#39;m wrong, where are the protests about a falling standard of living, high house prices, national debt? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>How about find a job that you like? Make a job that you like? I think that if people started trying to find value in what they create and produce instead of what kind of crap they &#39;fight for&#39; or accumulate the world would be a better place. This whole &quot;it&#39;s either work a shitty job or don&#39;t work&quot; is nonsense. If people spent more time bettering themselves and finding out what THEY are interested in, they wouldn&#39;t feel the need to spend their time &#39;bettering others&#39;, virtue signaling, and telling other people what &#39;really matters&#39;. I&#39;ve worked a load of crap jobs, but then I started finding things that interested me and now I do something that is fun, challenging, and gives me the opportunity to propose better ways of doing things. Hating R or D doesn&#39;t stop someone from hating themselves.</p>

<p>That makes me sad. There were massive protests -- the media just blacked them out just like they blacked out the rest of the story. I thought people here would know better.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Occupy Wall St was a protest against an obvious &quot;bogeyman&quot; (rich bankers).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The central demand of OWS was actually the excessive influence of money in politics. Which IMO is the root cause of most of what&#39;s wrong with US government. They did focus in particular on the banks, but remember, this was at the height of the recession the bankers brought on -- pretty damn justified.</p>

<p>Re: Brexit, the young people I know who voted remain were primarily worried about the work opportunities it would cut them off from early in their careers, vs. the old people whose careers were already established and not so threatened by being cut off from the EU. You can disagree with it being in their best interest overall, but it&#39;s a reasonable position to not want to vote your way out of a large proportion of your potential job opportunities in an economy this uncertain. (Same applies to Le Pen in France).</p>

<p>Millennial here, some of my friends are idiots and fit your description, but those who know better don&#39;t show up in a public place and show their face and protest like previous generations. This is why there are movements like Anonymous and unfortunately Antifa. </p>

<p>Take Occupy for example, once they gained enough power the Feds identified the leaders and arrested them all. They did the same to Anonymous. Once you&#39;ve been unmasked they just throw you in jail.</p>

<p>We grew up under surveillance, they&#39;ve been watching, testing us, brainwashing us, and thinning the herd since we were children.</p>

<p>So we found new ways to subvert the system: cryptocurrencies, the legality of cannabis, hacking, leaking, and whistleblowing.</p>

<p>We are Edward Snowden, Manning, and Seth Rich.</p>

Meanwhile Manning spent 7-years in prison and was likely MKultraed. They were whistleblowers, and in Seth Rich&#39;s case they made an example of him, and they&#39;re still punishing Snowden by not letting him come home and face a fair trial.</p>

<p>Umm...you must be alluding to Bernie Sanders, right? He wasn&#39;t the candidate picked by the Dems.  If you are talking about Hilary Clinton - are you <em>kidding</em> me? You&#39;re saying Hilary Clinton - a carved in stone establishment figure - part of the political dynasty, who was obviously central to the corrupt DNS candidate rigging scandal to get her to run for presidency - <em>she</em> is somehow believed when she says she&#39;s against a &quot;broken, exploitative system&quot;? She benefited from such a system.  She&#39;s right up there as one of the most corrupt politicians to walk this earth.  You&#39;re holding up the idea that the young voted for her as a good example of how they young are not brainwashed? You&#39;ve just made the polar opposite point.</p>

<p>And also - you make my point that everyone votes for the uniparty.  The young have been successfully &quot;played&quot; if they think voting R or D makes a difference.  They get screwed over by either.  Because they&#39;re just different coloured labels on a wine bottle - same wine inside.</p>

<p>PC is the tool used regarding everything you describe above.  PC is a part of identity politics.  In this world of PC, you are your skin colour, you are your sex.  It&#39;s the opposite of skin and sex blindness.  PC judges everybody by their skin colour and sex in an incendiary way.  We judge what people say in context to their skin colour and sex, the actual content matters a lot less.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, Sanders. I was referring to 2016 more broadly, extending to the primaries, when young people overwhelmingly supported Bernie Sanders by ridiculous margins. Then they got screwed by the DNC, and many stayed home in November, voted third party, or else held their noses and voted for one of the unprecedentedly terrible candidates nominated by a major party. </p>

<p>The Republican/Democratic binary enforced by the current system is a sad reality that most young people despise. I know many who are actively fighting to change it. Older people I know are much more likely to be lifelong party loyalists. Young people are more likely to grudgingly vote within-party because they feel trapped by the garbage system they&#39;re inheriting from their elders.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s something I really want you to think about in terms of &quot;PC&quot;. We&#39;re agreed that shallow it&#39;s misdirection. And it comes from both/all sides to a considerable degree.

<p>I get your point on the young being disaffected.  I just wish they would be galvanized to protest against the establishment as they did when Trump got in.  He was the bogeyman.  Are social media platforms censoring anti-establishment voices? I&#39;m not seeing these nearly as much as anti-Trump or anti-Clinton commentary at the time of the election.  There needs to be a true anti-establishment movement against the political apparatus. </p>

<p>I totally agree with you that the older generations are embedded into the system and will vote on party lines (I&#39;m 45 by the way).  I just think they are the beneficiaries of this sytem and the younger generations are picking up the tab.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, part of the problem is that the media doesn&#39;t cover anti-establishment protests. It&#39;s pretty safe to bet that if it&#39;s against the establishments&#39; collective interest, it&#39;s not going to get much air time.

<p>they do NOT protest about high house prices, crappy wages, nor the enormous national debts being piled up (e.g. US has $20,000,000,000,000 in national debt, of which in 8 short years Obama added another $10,000,000,000,000) - yet these are massive issues that affect, and will affect, the younger generations significantly. </p>

<p>Again, this is simply not true.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are wrong here.</p>

<p>The younger generations have not been brainwashed at all. It is highly dependent on what state you live in and also it seems the 40-55 range are the ones that are the most brainwashed.</p>

<p>Most young people are fearful of losing their jobs and careers and its just easier to conform than to challenge. the 40-55 age range are the ones that the brainwashing is instilled in their up bringing.</p>

<p>For me a simple test on how brainwashed a person is is ask them their real thoughts on 9/11.</p>

<p>Someone who has the capability of critical thinking will answer this question at the very least as &quot; Yeah im not sure it was an inside job but they are definitely not telling us the whole story because certain things do not add up.&quot;</p>

<p>I dont expect everyone around me to understand the complexities of all that is going on in the world but the 9/11 story for me is the dealbreaker for the ability to critically think.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As a Millennial myself, I tend to not agree with most of what is said in this thread. We tend to feel that the older generations have fucked up. We weren&#39;t around when the deep state took control. When TPTB took over cable media. We weren&#39;t around when the foundations of what would become the Patriot Act were laid down. We weren&#39;t around during the Red Scare - but we can read about it and Google anything we want.</p>

<p>Why are we the &#39;brainwashed&#39; ones and not those that never grew up without internet and swallowed everything cable media or the church tole them?</p>

<p>Why aren&#39;t we out on the streets protesting? Because we see the establishment is the only thing we have. I read all the time here that people hate on international institutions like the EU and can&#39;t understand why someone like Macron was voted in. Well, I do. It means security, stability and peace. Yes, there are many problems to address, but was is the other option? Taking the whole system down? Hell the F no. Name me one country that rejected the global system and fared well after. We understand that we need to fix the institutions from within, not take them down wholly. We are very aware of who is actually in control, and how fragile the system is. But at the end of the day, the system works for both elite and us &#39;slaves&#39;.</p>

<p>The western Millennials realize how spoiled, self-absorbed and unsustainable the generation before them has been. That is why low-eco footprint and anti-materialism have become a thing (yes, the Left is pushing it too far). But we realize that 80% of the world is worse off than us, partly because of the generations before us.</p>

<p>We have read about your Vietnam and Korea wars, your sponsorship and reliance on oil economies, your CO2 emissions, your plastic, your Big Pharma, your tobacco, your Western Arrogance, your maximizing of credit cards, your white nationalism, your regional rivalry, your colonialism, your support of dictators, constant fighting between left and right..... NO THANK YOU. How dare you call a generation brainwashed when we are all just too numb from needing to clean up your shit to actually go go out and carry a protest sign? Of course we&#39;d rather click a &#39;like&#39; button after spending a day in school / college learning about the broken system that was left for us to fix.</p>

<p>And you know what is the worst thing? Those same people tell us to take down the only things we view as positive relics from that horrible past, things like the EU, NATO, NAFTA .... things may I remind you, you stuffed down our throats to begin with.</p>

<p>We Millennials can&#39;t wait for the robots to take over. Then at least Logic would finally prevail.  </p>

TBTB are scared of the younger generations organizing in this way.  You might laugh at my suggestions, but they are easy for each individual to do, and have a big impact on how we can reject media channels collectively.  Reject useless university degrees. You don&#39;t try to take the whole system down - you shock it. And shock it again.  </p>

<p>This shit has been dumped on YOU.  And you&#39;re paying the tab for it.  And you&#39;re collectively OK with that.  You should be boycotting the establishment in everyway possible. Instead, all I see are people defending the status quo and saying things are good now, the EU is OK, the western governments are OK, globalisation is OK - everything&#39;s OK.  You can&#39;t hold both positions.  You can&#39;t accept that you&#39;ve been robbed of ambition and been given a huge bill, and that that is OK. </p>

I can see how much debt has been piled onto the shoulders of the young.  I can see their wages have been suppressed to the point that life is no longer about amibtion, but about survival.  Two wage families to merely survive.     </p>

<p>The sanguine responses from younger people in this thread kind of make my point for me.  It&#39;s like &quot;hey, it&#39;s OK, life&#39;s good, and you know, we do protest, we just do youtube videos instead of taking to the streets&quot;.  Good luck with that.  Your future.

<p>You&#39;ve paid off your mortgage then? Well done at 31.  Or you rent?</p>

<p>Since you give an anecdote....I am debt-free, <strong>mortgage-free</strong>, two kids, have 6 figures of savings.  I&#39;m more representative of my age group than you are of yours - that much I do know.  Economic trends will back up my point.  You are an outlier of your age group, much less so for myself - and we&#39;re only 14 years apart.  </p>

<p>I agree with you.  You&#39;re not seeing a trend here? My dad got a fantastic retirement package.  His generation did really well.  I&#39;ll not get anything like the pension their generation did.  This trend has hit a point where I can see younger generations are flat-out being denied true opportunities to succeed.  Saying &quot;things are cool&quot; isn&#39;t helping them.</p>

<p>War games have been going on for decades.  I grew up through the Cold War of the 80s.  </p>

<p>This is definitely part of the problem the younger generations are facing.  Your currencies (and wages) have been devalued, assets inflated.  Western governments can&#39;t afford to pay their own bills and borrow money that YOU are paying back and will be forced to pay back for decades to come.  Money that could have been spent on infrastructure and health is lost into the blackhole of interest repayments on the exploding national debt.</p>

<p>Political correctness is about controlling what people say through shame.  Someone who says &quot;women are inferior to men&quot; or &quot;blacks are dumber than whites&quot; have no shame to begin with.  People who say &quot;hey, you know, the wage gap doesn&#39;t exist comparing like-for-like jobs, it&#39;s only when you aggregate earnings between the sexes that you see a wage gap&quot; - that kind of statement is shamed out of existence by the &quot;thought police&quot; of political correctness - they shame the person with an insinuation of sexism - even though there is ZERO sexism in such a comment.  OR, someone says &quot;interesting that there is such a diversity of average IQ levels from country to country&quot; - this is a FACT, but someone praticising political correctness will shame the person by calling them a racist, even though that person is just stating a fact.  We should be free to speak factually without being shamed.</p>

<p>So you reveal yourself as someone so scared to have an opinion that veers off the <em>current</em>, accepted politically correct view, that you can&#39;t accept distinct characteristics in human beings, based on genetics? This is a perverse and twisted view of equality - that we must have the same characteristics - we must literally be equal in our genetics.  Forget about equality of opportunity, no - we must physically be equal.  And if anyone suggests that there are differences in intelligence, height, hair colour, eye colour - you get to dumbly virtue signal and say &quot;racist&quot;.</p>

<p>So let me be clear: you do NOT accept that the human race consists of groups of people with varying characteristics based on genetics, including levels of intelligence? Yes or no would suffice, but feel free to elaborate on why you &quot;believe&quot; (not know) what you believe.</p>

<p>You do accept that there are differences in intelligence from <strong>person to person</strong>, right? That intelligence is as influenced by genes as how tall you will grow? That there are genetic similiarities in localities (countries, groups of countries) - such as Scandanvians having lighter hair and eye colour - you&#39;d go along with that, right? Because so far, it&#39;s not &quot;racist&quot; because eye colour doesn&#39;t matter - so that&#39;s &quot;okay&quot; for you.  You would accept there are differences in intelligence from person to person, not region to region - that&#39;s &quot;racist&quot; (even if technically, we&#39;re not necessarily distinguishing between races here, but regions of the world). </p>

<blockquote>
<p>How European culture is the only real culture or civilization is it going to be more pseudoscience opinionated bullshit that is clearly based in racism? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ah, yes - the white man is a racist argument.  Ironically, such an argument can never see its own inherent racism.  Not sure why you mentioned that statement, but you tie it up into differences in IQ, I guess? Yes, the IQ map - it must be the white man trying to prove his superiority - that would be where the &quot;racism&quot; lies.  The white man proving his dominance in intelligence.  Oh, except one thing. It&#39;s Asian regions that are deemed the most intelligent if we are to accept these standardised tests of intelligence.  So, what gives here? How can  white men score such a spectacular own goal by deciding that 2.5Bn+ people are more intelligent than their own genetic background? Or was it Asian researchers who decided that? No it can&#39;t be - Asians can&#39;t be racists (I&#39;m just going along with your thinking) - maybe....it is what it is? Maybe there are differences in intelligence from region to region based on a standardised test.  &quot;It must be cultural&quot;.  Well, then - Asian cultures are better suited to the IQ test - better than old whitey, who&#39;s a good 6 to 8 IQ points behind the best of the Asians - on average.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wowie you wrote a lot. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll try to keep this brief as to not end up in a wall of text discussion. IQ based off race isn&#39;t racist in itself but it almost doesn&#39;t prove anything since there&#39;s a lot more factors to consider than just race when you go from a war torn country in Africa where survival is the only thing that matters to a country like China where education is considered extremely important. </p>

<p>Who cares what the tests say even though they actually say Jews not Asians are at the top of that test. It doesn&#39;t prove anything because there&#39;s so many factors to consider in that. Also I&#39;m not even doubting that some races may be smarter than others (in some things) what I&#39;m doubting is the IQ test itself, IQ measures intelligence but I doubt it can measure all forms of intelligence and different types of intelligences are all crucial. For example I&#39;m great at programming and absolute dog shit when it comes to mechanical abilities. </p>

<p>But I&#39;m a smart programmer and make more money than the mechanic, does that mean I&#39;m smarter than him or is he smarter than me? We both need each other to make the machine run ultimately but let&#39;s sit there and figure out which one of us is more important. </p>

<p>And he&#39;ll have his version of an IQ test and I&#39;ll have mine and both will say we&#39;re smarter than the other. That&#39;s pretty much how I see IQ and the tests. No shit Africans are going to score low on it, the society itself is barely alive due to a variety of reasons.</p>

<p>Another reason I can&#39;t believe IQ tests is because history says otherwise, I&#39;ll be opening up a can of worms here but during the Islamic Golden Age it was the Arabs and Persians who were inventing everything under the moon from 800 to 1300 AD not Europeans. But they&#39;re considered today by this IQ map as some of the dumbest people in the world,yrt back them they were much smarter than the Europeans having all the leading Universities in the world such as in Baghdad and Alexandria, the race of people hasn&#39;t changed dramatically you can argue the Greeks and Romans did that. But even Greece is a shithole now and the race is still pretty much the same. This again further proves why IQ tests especially those based off race are complete trash. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not that a complete moron I don&#39;t doubt that there are predispositions to certain type of intelligences based off genetics. And those genetics are going to be rooted in the race of individual or group. However those predispositions might only bloom if the correct environment is allowed for it and if not they will more than likely be stunted. </p>

<p>You can take a kid with an IQ of 200 and throw him with the Aborigines to be raised you think that kids high IQ will matter in 20 years? No he&#39;ll be too dumb to figure out how to use a smartphone and have way too much catch up to do for any of those fancy IQ points to matter.</p>

<p>Environment matters, power matters, history matters. You can&#39;t seriously look at the map of today and just say oh it&#39;s because the white race is superior and not know history because 400 years ago it was the Ottoman Empire that was the superpower of the world and FYI they aren&#39;t Anglo-Saxon, Jewish or Mongolian. Yet they were the first peoples to fire cannons and use gun powder as weapons. So yes there are differences in races but races can get stunted or grow depending on the environmental factors there is no one true superior race. </p>

<p>OK, the blank slate theory right off the bat. You completely dismiss the idea that intelligence is largely genetic (without bringing forward any evidence), but instead it&#39;s simply how well educated you are.  This is laughably simplistic and plain wrong.  We can see this in intelligence differences <em>from person to person</em> with the very same educational / experience backgrounds.  Actually, heritability of intelligence rises to 0.75 in adults.  To be clear, intelligence is 75% influenced by genetics, NOT environment - <a href="http://www.unc.edu/%7Enielsen/soci850/odocs/apa_01.htm">source</a>.  If you are right, then we would see a much more uniform level of intelligence dependent on what class of society you belong to and &quot;what you learnt at school&quot;.  IQ is not meant to be measure &quot;what you learnt at school&quot;, but raw intelligence.  In reality, intelligence is a bell curve distribution regardless of educational background.  Actually, there&#39;s a difference between men and women in that men have a &quot;flatter&quot; bell curve (more men at the extremes of intelligence) than women&#39;s distribution of intelligence. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>You don&#39;t understand the purpose of IQ.  You&#39;re confusing it with rote learning.  Rote learning has far more to do with the ability to remember things than raw intelligence.   Raw intelligence is much more initiative-based than that.  Raw intelligence finds patterns and rules without being told what they are.   Also realise that you&#39;re putting yourself in the authorative position of knowing more about measuring intelligence than the collective works of many people who&#39;ve spent decades studying and measuring human intelligence.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;re confusing the application of intelligence with raw intelligence.   You&#39;re also applying an arbitrary and emotional aspect to all of this (&quot;importance&quot;).  This is like saying &quot;so what if people have varying heights, are we suggesting shorter people are less impotrant than taller people?&quot; - it&#39;s a specious and irrelevant point - a weak appeal to emotion as if to say &quot;finding differences is bad - it upsets people!&quot;.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>And he&#39;ll have his version of an IQ test and I&#39;ll have mine and both will say we&#39;re smarter than the other. That&#39;s pretty much how I see IQ and the tests. No shit Africans are going to score low on it, the society itself is barely alive due to a variety of reasons.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, you posit the blank slate theory that genetics do not play a part, but only environment does - based on no evidence whatsoever.  You also introduce a misrepresentation of how measuring IQ actually works.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Another reason I can&#39;t believe IQ tests is because history says otherwise, I&#39;ll be opening up a can of worms here but during the Islamic Golden Age it was the Arabs and Persians who were inventing everything under the moon from 800 to 1300 AD not Europeans.

You can argue Greeks and Romans did similar things but even Greece is a shithole now and the race is still pretty much the same. This again further proves why IQ tests especially those based off race are complete trash. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The points above completely forgo intelligence distribution amongst groups of people.  It only takes a handful of very intelligent people to shape a society in one way or another.   Your above examples don&#39;t allude to an overall high level of raw intelligence amongst an entire group of people - they show that a small number of people shaped those societies in a very enlightening way.  No different to our own technological progress in the west.  Take away Einstein, Newton, Tesla, Bell, Edison etc - where would we be? Do those geniuses make us geniuses? Of course not.  Bell curve and all that. Maybe other individuals could have filled their boots if those aforementioned geniuses did not exist, but we might be 10 or 20 years&#39; behind where we are now in technological advancements.  Conversely, those with stunningly high levels of raw intelligence who never <em>realised</em> that intelligence - that lack of realisation of such intelligence has stopped us progressing even faster than we are doing right now.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m not a complete moron I don&#39;t doubt that there are predispositions to certain type of intelligences based off genetics. And those genetics are going to be rooted in the race of individual or group. However those predispositions might only bloom if the correct environment is allowed for it and if not they will more than likely be stunted. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course intelligence can be harnessed to its potential or crushed.  No argument there.  But this is after the fact of genetics.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>You can take a kid with an IQ of 200 and throw him with the Aborigines to be raised you think that kids high IQ will matter in 20 years? No he&#39;ll be too dumb to figure out how to use a smartphone and have way too much catch up to do for any of those fancy IQ points to matter.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A separate point to my central  argument regarding genetically influenced IQ differences from region to region, but nonetheless I totally agree with you.  Your usefulness is down to how well you can interact with your environment.  No argument there.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Environment matters, power matters, history matters. You can&#39;t seriously look at the map of today and just say oh it&#39;s because the white race is superior and not know history because 400 years ago it was the Ottoman Empire that was the superpower of the world and FYI they aren&#39;t Anglo-Saxon, Jewish or Mongolian. Yet they were the first peoples to fire cannons and use gun powder as weapons. So yes there are differences in races but races can get stunted or grow depending on the environmental factors there is no one true superior race. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why are you saying &quot;oh it&#39;s because the white race is superior&quot;? That point was never made.  It&#39;s Asian countries that by-and-large (if we&#39;re going to talk about race) have the highest IQ averages.  That negates the &quot;IQ scores are there to make whites look good&quot; argument.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>and not know history because 400 years ago it was the Ottoman Empire that was the superpower of the world and FYI they aren&#39;t Anglo-Saxon, Jewish or Mongolian. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, you fail to understand intelligence distribution.  It only takes a handful of people to shape a country in one way or another.  North Korea scores very highly on IQ - you think that matters to the average individual there? Same with previous empires both good and bad - they&#39;re shaped by a small number of people in good and bad ways.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>So yes there are differences in races but races can get stunted or grow depending on the environmental factors there is no one true superior race. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ll just finish with the fact that intelligence in adults has a heritability score of .75.  Yes, environmental factors CAN shape intelligence, and certainly promote and extinguish underlying intelligence, but it&#39;s a much smaller influence than genetics.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Having been born in the &#39;50s, I have a perspective that most of this sub lacks.  Here is a truth that the mainstream media will never tell you.</p>

<p>Life was <strong>so much better</strong> for almost everyone in the 50s, 60s, and 70s.  People got together face to face constantly, at parties, chatting over the garden fence, playing sports and taking trips.  Getting a job was not hard, and you didn&#39;t have to work like a fiend to keep it.  Most women had no work other than home and family and that meant that when husbands came home they could relax; the chores were done.  </p>

<p>Here&#39;s the dirty secret feminists don&#39;t want you to know:  Women did not feel oppressed by this situation.  They had time to spend with their children, time to get enough sleep and prepare nutritious meals, time to plan parties and time to put their feet up and read a good book.  They were not moaning and wishing to spend their entire day alone in a windowless cubicle while someone else watched their children. </p>

<p>Obesity was so rare that the circus sideshow had a &quot;fat man.&quot;  That &quot;fat man&quot; can now be seen a dozen times a day walking down any city street.  Food was much more natural, GMOs didn&#39;t exist, kids weren&#39;t pumped full of vaccines. </p>

<p>But how about blacks, you ask?  Many, many fewer of them were in prison.  </p>

<p>Life is not getting better.  The more the tentacles of the global domination agenda strangle society, the worse things get.  It cannot be otherwise.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t feel like typing forever to disprove everything you wrote so I&#39;ll just state the ones most relevant to me:</p>

<p>Women didn&#39;t have reproductive freedom. Women couldn&#39;t open a bank account or start a business. Women couldn&#39;t attend elite universities. Women could be fired for getting pregnant. Women couldn&#39;t be a lawyer. Women couldn&#39;t run in the Boston Marathon. Marital rape was legal. Domestic violence was ignored.</p>

<p>Please try to defend any if this. Then try to tell us Blacks were happier oppressed, and gay people were happier in the closet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you!</p>

<p>I was born in 1972, and have seen a similar big fall in the standard of living, albeit from a slightly later viewpoint.  </p>

<p>All of your points are exactly what I&#39;ve witnessed growing up in the UK - I think it&#39;s the same all over the western world. The young of today are being cheated and they don&#39;t even TRULY realise it.  If they did, they would flat-out reject this system.  As it is, they are not doing that - they&#39;re just toeing the line, and that&#39;s why I entitled this thread as I did.  Young people have been robbed of ambition.  Now it&#39;s all about surviving on two wages to pay the mortgage, wraparound child care, crap wages, humoungous national debts that will pin down generations into a non-ambitious, &quot;surviving&quot; life without ambition. </p>

<p>It&#39;s honestly depressing how the young are not really seeing it, or are saying &quot;we&#39;re already protesting&quot;.  It&#39;s their future. I wish them the best.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, there is a major propaganda push to convince young people that the past sucked and things are getting better.  In fact the 60s in the US were so good that you would weep with anguish if I were to describe those days to you.  </p>

<p>Of course crappy things happened back then too, but now, our whole world is crappy.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Governments have to at the very least service the interest on these debts.  The UK for example pay roughly a £1Bn a week in the interest alone on their national debt.  </p>

<p><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/economics/10849333/Interest-bill-on-UKs-1.27-trillion-debt-to-hit-1bn-a-week.html">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/economics/10849333/Interest-bill-on-UKs-1.27-trillion-debt-to-hit-1bn-a-week.html</a></p>

<p>That was back in 2014, when the national debt was £1.27Tn.  It&#39;s now £1.86Tn just 3 years later &gt; <a href="http://www.nationaldebtclock.co.uk/">http://www.nationaldebtclock.co.uk/</a></p>

<p>Assuming it&#39;s £1.5Bn a week with the extra debt now in 2017, that&#39;s £78Bn a year in interest alone.  That&#39;s just shy of what&#39;s spent on education in the UK per year. </p>
