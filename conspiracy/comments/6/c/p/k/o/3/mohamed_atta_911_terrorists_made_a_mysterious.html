        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I live right near here so when the weird itinerary pops up in the news every once in awhile... I started to notice that there was always a Pizza Hut mentioned... The joke writes itself. Q: Why did they come all the way up here for one night then right back to Boston. A: That must be some damn good pizza. </p>

<p>These few articles talk about how the FBI was keeping people all hush hush... the first one is just a nbc article for a little mainstream media flair... the next 2 are Portland Press Herald... local paper up here... not some tabloid thing. After that a couple sites that showed up in google... they seem to try to dissect the situation but I can&#39;t vouch for how credible they are. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/id/14686192/ns/msnbc-hardball_with_chris_matthews/t/mystery-what-was-atta-doing/">http://www.nbcnews.com/id/14686192/ns/msnbc-hardball_with_chris_matthews/t/mystery-what-was-atta-doing/</a></p>

<p>&quot;Financial records and bank video show Atta and Al-Omari made two ATM withdrawals in Portland, and the men were reportedly spotted at an area Wal-Mart, as well as in the parking lot of a <strong>Pizza Hut</strong> restaurant.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.pressherald.com/2011/08/25/september-11-portland-maine-chronology-fbi-mohamed-atta-abdulaziz-alomari/">http://www.pressherald.com/2011/08/25/september-11-portland-maine-chronology-fbi-mohamed-atta-abdulaziz-alomari/</a></p>

<p>&quot;As recently as Saturday, an FBI agent visited the International House of Pancakes on Maine Mall Road in South Portland, next to <strong>Pizza Hut</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The FBI called <strong>Pizzeria Uno</strong> in South Portland...&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.pressherald.com/2014/03/31/filmmaker_set_to_visit_maine_puzzled_by_silence_of_those_who_saw_9_11_terrorists_up_close_/">http://www.pressherald.com/2014/03/31/filmmaker_set_to_visit_maine_puzzled_by_silence_of_those_who_saw_9_11_terrorists_up_close_/</a></p>

<p>After checking into the hotel, Atta and Alomari were seen or photographed at four businesses in South Portland: <strong>Pizza Hut,</strong> a KeyBank drive-up ATM machine, an ATM machine at an <strong>Uno Pizzeria &amp; Grill,</strong> and at the Jetport gas station.</p>

<p>Forum post that says locals said <strong>&quot;hijackers involved in the Sept. 11 attacks found a pattern in their orders for pizza.&quot;</strong></p>

<p>Bonus fun - Saw an old forum post about a paperboy from my town that remembered seeing the guys the morning of 9/11/01 with a huge pile of suitcases... They told the newspaper about it... then rescinded when the FBI showed up. I went to see what he&#39;s up to now... fuckin&#39; running for senate. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Devil&#39;s advocate as someone from Maine: at the time of 9/11, pizza would have basically been the only palatable food at the time.  No, I&#39;m not really exaggerating.  Pizza and chain food (McDonald&#39;s, KFC, Taco Bell).  To the point where I&#39;d give less weight to there being some deeper meaning on code.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m from Maine too... I know Portland didn&#39;t have the foodie scene back in 2001 and that it has now... but I have a feeling Pizza Hut and Pizzeria UNO aren&#39;t hallal... but there seems to be a lot of conflict about exactly how &quot;muslim&quot; Atta was... seemed to like booze and strippers a bit too much to be truly devout. </p>

<p>Still confusing though... why even come to Maine at all? They were in Boston on 9/10... drove up to Maine that night for pizza and boxcuttters and then flew right back to Boston early the next morning... almost missed their flight... they could have just stayed in Boston and scored Pizza Hut. Why endanger the operation with a quick roadtrip to Portland and back? </p>

<p>I know.  You know, what <em>I&#39;ve</em> always been confused about was... Maine was like +98% white back then.  How was that supposed to be low profile?</p>

<p>I have to presume it was to be in an area of lower surveillance, but that wE always odd.  I <em>don&#39;t</em> find the pizza part odd.  Even if you&#39;re going by &quot;halal&quot;, there&#39;s still ways to eat pizza without pepperoni.  Just doesn&#39;t taste as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One theory I heard was that Atta didn&#39;t actually die on 9/11... he bounced off to somewhere else... and wasn&#39;t involved in the execution of the plan. </p>

<p>They why the came up to Maine... to make sure they stuck out extremely well... make sure they were spotted buying boxcutters and remembered later... same reason they made sure the luggage didn&#39;t make it on the flight... to leave behind an orgy of evidence... including his will... which would have been pointless to bring on the flight... unless it was printed on the same jetfuel-proof paper the other guy&#39;s passport was made out of... so it could be found in the streets beneath the WTC. </p>
