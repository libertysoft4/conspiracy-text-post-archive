    <div class="md"><p>You and I don&#39;t share the same God, so I don&#39;t care what you think he says. </p>

<p>Homosexuality is found throughout nature and by definition can be considered natural. It happens organically and needs no outside forces. It also hurts no one and is an expression of love which one would think a loving God would approve of.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>God doesn&#39;t approve of sin, those who commit homosexuality are just as guilty as those who commit murder in the eyes of God.</p>

<p>Homosexuality is unnatural and goes against the natural use of our bodies.  Just because an animal does commits homosexual acts, doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s natural, it means the animal is severely misguided, just as human homosexuals are misguided into thinking it&#39;s ok.  </p>

<p>At any rate, humans are not animals and they should be corrected when they do these perverted acts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Levitical law &amp; punishment of the old testament was for the nation of Israel.

We are all sinners and we all need a Savior and that Savior is Jesus Christ.  Homosexuals can become ex-homosexuals, if they believe in Jesus Christ and turn away from their sin.</p>

<p>No joke.  Look at this Kardashian thing.  It&#39;s now perfectly acceptable for men to dress as women, so whole industries (cosmetics, clothing, etc) get to market to a whole new group.  I had a friend who (back before it was all that acceptable) sold vintage clothing on ebay.  You would not believe the prices people would get for larger size pump shoes or boots, vintage underwear etc, as long as the sizes were larger and they were extremely feminine in style.  The names buying these items were almost always &quot;Steve&quot; &quot;Marty&quot; or whatever.  She would tell me all kinds of hilarious stories about it, and she made out like a bandit.</p>

<p>God doesn&#39;t approve of sin, those who commit homosexuality are just as guilty as those who commit murder in the eyes of God.</p>

<p>God doesn&#39;t exist, and no one is obligated to follow the rules of your magical sky fairy because you want them to.  Keep your nose out of other people&#39;s private affairs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just because you don&#39;t believe in God, doesn&#39;t mean He doesn&#39;t exist.  It&#39;s like saying that Trump doesn&#39;t exist, but yet Trump does exist and he&#39;s still president, whether you believe Trump exist or not.  </p>

<p>Also, I&#39;m here to save people from the path of perversion and direct them to the path of correction &amp; salvation through Jesus Christ, in which all of mankind may be saved through Him, so that no person will perish, but they&#39;ll receive the gift of everlasting life</p>
