<p>Seth Rich&#39;s parents comment on son&#39;s death</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>      &gt;OMAHA, Neb. (WOWT) - Our sister station WOWT reached out to the family of slain DNC staff member Seth Rich in the wake of increasing speculation as to the cause of his death.
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
<p>Twenty-seven-year-old Seth Conrad Rich, an Omaha native, was shot multiple times in Washington D.C. July 10. No arrests have been made in the case.</p>

<p>Recently a private investigator looking into the murder on behalf of the Rich family claimed that Seth had been in correspondence with Wikileaks, which may be tied to Seth&#39;s murder.</p>

<p>Seth&#39;s family refutes the claims in their statement.
&quot;As we&#39;ve seen through the past year of unsubstantiated claims, we see no facts, we have seen no evidence, we have been approached with no emails and only learned about this when contacted by the press.&quot; Said the Rich Family
The Rich family added that there would have to be substantial evidence to convince them, which they have yet to see.</p>

<p>&quot;Even if tomorrow, an email was found, it is not a high enough bar of evidence to prove any interactions as emails can be altered and we&#39;ve seen that those interested in pushing conspiracies will stop at nothing to do so. We are a family who is committed to facts, not fake evidence that surfaces every few months to fill the void and distract law enforcement and the general public from finding Seth&#39;s murderers.&quot;
The Rich&#39;s said that the private investigator who spoke to the press was offered to the Rich family and paid for by a third party, and contractually was barred from speaking to the press or anyone outside of law enforcement or the family unless explicitly authorized by the family.
Police believe that the murder happened during a robbery attempt.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Look.. I don&#39;t know if they genuinely think it was a random guy off the street that killed him or not. That might totally be the case, and they <em>aren&#39;t</em> being told what to say by PR people.</p>

<p>But.. This is a conspiracy sub and it&#39;s absolutely possible they <em>are</em> being told to tell people on the internet to stop looking into it, especially since there are things that absolutely seem suspicious to a lot of people here.</p>

<p>I get that it&#39;s their wish and I even kind of see where they&#39;re coming from <em>in a way</em>, but unless they actually know 100% who killed him how can they possibly know who it was and why they did it?</p>

<p>Regardless, whether they think it was a robbery or whether they think it was an assassination, does <em>anyone</em>, parents or not, have any kind of right to tell internet users to just stop talking about it? </p>

<p>Say JFK was killed recently instead of when he was. If his relatives said &quot;hey guys, it was a lone shooter who was just crazy, please stop speculating!&quot; does that mean we should actually stop thinking it was someone else with a different motive because they asked?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You honestly don&#39;t see the difference at all between each individual sub having their own rules that they&#39;re allowed to enforce any way they wish (science will remove unsourced comments, some tv show subs will remove people who go there to post about how shitty that tv show is, etc) and reddit the website creating special rules for <em>one specific</em> subreddit?</p>

<p>The point of t_d was for supporters of him to gather, shit post to their hearts content and use the sub as one giant rally and everyone knew that. It was in their sidebar and rules. There was an entirely separate sub for <em>anything else</em> related to Trump.</p>

<p>Why are they not allowed to complain about censorship? Because they enforce their rules? Even here if someone makes a post about another sub censoring them, no one gives a shit and will point it out if the post they&#39;re complaining about broke that subreddits rules. So how is it censorship for t_d to enforce <em>their</em> rules?</p>

<p>If this sub was given special rules to abide by, that no other sub needed to follow, would we not be allowed to complain because we ban people who come here only to hate on conspiracy theories?</p>

<p>That&#39;s really all besides the point anyway. No sub, whether they &quot;censor&quot; anyone or not, should be made to follow a special set of rules that no other sub has to. <em>Especially</em> considering there are other subs that censor and brigade, yet they have the same rules we all do.</p>

<p>People can keep saying &quot;it&#39;s a private website!!!!&quot; <em>all</em> they want, but I know that most of the people saying this would not be saying that if this private website singled out a Hillary sub, an Islamic, Muslim or Jewish sub. Pretty much anything except Trump related shit. </p>

<p>There&#39;s been a few times everybody got pissed over censorship or a deleted sub, and those subs were waaay fucking worse than a 24/7 President rally. Multiple subs went private and tons of people, liberals and conservatives threatened to or did leave. Now we see shit like all the default mods literally <em>begging</em> the admins in chat to straight up delete t_d just cause they don&#39;t like Trump or the sub.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And there&#39;s the real rub.  Reddit imposes the rules different on T_D in a way that impacts all subs, because the sitewide &quot;no brigading/doxxing/harassing&quot; rule is actually &quot;no brigading/doxxing/harassing unless it&#39;s against T_D&quot;.  That affects the entire character of the rule and diminishes the integrity of the site.  If you know about this and are being sufficiently honest about yourself, you can&#39;t <em>only</em> say &quot;those damn T_D Trumptards are ruining the site for everyone&quot;, because now you have to live with the reality that a site you might have cared about for years before you even cared about politics now openly caters to the anti-Trump narrative and all the sorts of communities that ally with that.</p>

<p>Plus--and I hope the irony here isn&#39;t lost on anyone--this feeds right into the anti-leftist reactionary movement (which you see in Youtube/minds.com skeptics and parts of Kekistan) when it claims that the ones screaming loudest about oppression are doing quite a lot of it themselves.  But as Jordan Peterson would put it, the leftists don&#39;t give a fuck about anything their opposition could say in the past, present, or future because their aim is not to win over society but to utterly destroy its foundations.</p>

<p>It was a &quot;rules for thee, not for me&quot; situation. SO many other subs did not have to follow the same rules. T_D was just supposed to &quot;shut up and take it&quot;? </p>

<p>You are misunderstanding my point. I&#39;m saying it was <em>once</em> because he saw what was going on and got the fuck outta there.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And had Epsteins personal underage sex slave employed at Maralago</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If this is really true (dunno why you ain&#39;t sourcing) it sounds to me like he either got her outta of the ring and/or he was getting information of the ring outta her.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And had MULTIPLE phone numbers inside Epstiens little black book of child rapists.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We already know Trump was acquainted with Epstein. I actually have a theory Trump had a suspicion of a ring and was trying to investigate it through Epstein.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>AND flew on Child rape express.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yea <em>too</em> the island, Which is what we were first talking about.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>AND Epstein had to plead the 5th when asked about Trumps tendency to rape children.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This doesn&#39;t really prove Trump raped any kids. I&#39;m guessing Epstein figured out Trump was investigating him and tried to throw suspicion on Trump.</p>

<p>Hotlinking to r/politics in r/the_donald is the exact rule. Including it in titles is not banned. </p>

<p>The removal of the mods by reddit was 100% justified, and I&#39;m surprised it took as long as it did. In recent days, concerted harassment directed at <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> was dramatically increasing, and that&#39;s a fact. Not &quot;propaganda.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reddit serves as an online bar. </p>

<p>Bars simply ban the undesirables once they&#39;ve acted out, hate speech, illegal content etc. They don&#39;t ban entire groups for the actions of a few. </p>

<p>Reddit is hurting multi hundred thousand user communities because of the actions of a few that could be false flag attacks, as is what happened with pg. The bar equivalent would be banning all Jews. </p>

<p>No, for so many reasons.</p>

<p>For starters, no group of people have been banned or censored at all, only a particular kind of activity.</p>

<p>If you really want to use Jews and bars as your metaphor, it would be more like banning circumcisions from happening inside the bar.</p>

<p>There is a vast a meaningful difference between private companies discriminating against people and having a say in what activities can take place on their property. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll concede this to make a different point. </p>

<p>Reddit inc has been treating td differently than other subs that do the same shit. </p>

<p>R/politics discord regularly brigades and trolls </p>

<p>The Trump hate subs are not filtered from the front page but to is </p>

<p>SRS and family raid, dox, blackmail, and hijack everything they don&#39;t like </p>

<p>I&#39;ve never heard of any sub having a banned user unbanned by an admin after doxxing except pg. </p>

<p>Td is the only sub known to have users comments anonymously edited by the fucking CEO of reddit. Obligatory fuck u/spez</p>

<p>Share blue, antifa, ctr, etc run rampant over r/politics but td gets in trouble for proving it </p>

<p>Td is the only sub banned from linking to another sub</p>

<p>People literally about killing the president </p>

<p>Blatant racism and sexism against straight or white people, and legal American citizens. </p>

<p>Need I continue? </p>

<p>Inb4 td did this to themselves. </p>

<p>Every example of wrongdoing by TD has been and is currently ongoing within other subs yet td is the only one punished. </p>

<p>I conceded that. You made a great refutation. I&#39;d also add that reddit has an obligation to remain unbiased and fair to all their users without regard to any circumstance. It&#39;s okay for a bar to slide a free drink occasionally. It&#39;s not okay for a company to silence their users especially for political reasons whether perceived or actual. </p>

<p>Why should that matter? If reddit is so horrible, go somewhere else and their rating will increase. To bring it back to the bar metaphor.</p>

<p>&quot;I don&#39;t like that bar! They kicked me out for getting loud and they never kick out their friends for being loud!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then why don&#39;t you go to another bar?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Because no other bar is as popular or has such a good beer selection!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It&#39;s up to you whether you think those things are worth sticking around for in the face of things you don&#39;t like. That&#39;s your choice, and it&#39;s the bar owner&#39;s choice how they run their bar. No one owes you a popular bar with the best beer selection that treats you exactly the way you want to be treated. There&#39;s a market out there, support another bar or open your own, but don&#39;t act like someone else&#39;s business owes you everything you want.&quot;</p>

<p>The obvious reasons. </p>

<p>Good business. </p>

<p>Ethics. Morals. Political correctness.  Those things the regressive left are so worried about. </p>

<p>By catering the way the site is used they blur the line between service provider and news outlets opening them up to liabilities they are wholly unprepared to face. See Facebook. </p>

<p>Am i not allowed to criticize the corrupt dipshits running this slowly dying site? </p>

<p>I&#39;m not owed anything. Nor am I suggesting as much. I&#39;m challenging them to justify their actions. To be accountable to their word. To act like fucking adults for a little while while they&#39;re in the spotlight. To be forthright, communicative, accessible, responsible, fair, and ethical human beings. Apparently that&#39;s difficult for people making fat stacks of money. </p>

<p>I have every right to state to my opinion, they have every right to censor me on their site. Censored users have every right to try them in the court of public opinion. Which is what we&#39;re doing here. Which is what will continue until reddit gives up, dies, or is replaced. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>While I agree with you t_d is ridiculous r/politics bans anyone and everyone who disagrees or posts with a dissenting opinion and the admins do nothing. There are subreddits for people to express their &quot;urges&quot; to commit pedophilia. The amount of censorship of anti or even non-pro Democratic viewpoints is ridiculous. The admins are basically preserving the right to free speech of pedophiles before those with dissenting political opinions. T_d may be full of looneys but name one sub that doesn&#39;t have their own. The fact that the admins are stepping in just further proves to me that reddit is bought and paid for by the leftist establishment in an attempt to further control what is displayed to reddit users. Echoing other sentiments it&#39;s scary to me because you used to be able to have an enlightened political discussion on r/pol and then the mods came and censored everything. Now I fear the same will come of this sub leaving only the wacknut conspiracies like the flat earth theory and those who disagree will be banned. So instead of actually having members who can refute the earth being flat only those who think the earth is flat and then this sub becomes a hive mind like all the rest of the generic vanilla mod controlled subs. I appreciate and learn from the diversity of opinion on this sub and fear this latest show of disregard for open discourse is a dangerous step to the development of another sub with a controlled agenda.</p>

<p>This is a flat out lie perpetuated by users of T_D to justify their censorship. It&#39;s projection and nothing more. If you follow the rules, (like not calling people shills), no one will ban you for having a conservative ideology in <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s impossible to have a valid discussion on anything. A while ago there was a thread on <a href="/r/getMotivated">/r/getMotivated</a> with a picture of Morgan Freeman telling Don Lemon how black people can succeed despite historical oppression. This sparked conversation, with one side saying they could and the other saying they couldn&#39;t. It was a civil discussion with some very good points being brought up on both sides. I saw no racism whatsoever. Then the mods locked it because of &#39;controversy and racism&#39;. </p>

<p>Indeed. A sign o&#39; the times, imo, although I&#39;m far from unpacking what it all means and points towards. The &#39;explanations&#39; offered on either side - cultural Marxism, no platform for hate etc - are all reductive, superficial and useless. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Removing T_D from being seen on <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a>.  They have changed the algorithm so many times then eventually removed it from being seen entirely.  Keep in mind this is a website that had a sub called Jailbait for years.  <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> should be a neutral space for all political parties but its run by mods that are democrats.  It should be call <a href="/r/democrats">/r/democrats</a>.  Worldnews, news, very rarely to you get anything other than stories with liberal agendas to the top.  The entire website pushes this republicans are climate change/science deniers agenda but try mentioning the fact that democrats are owned by big oil as well.  Climate change is the hardest politicized topic to unravel.  Yes humans have an impact but science created this problem by prolonging life combined with the development of tech that burns fossil fuels — science also does not have a cost effective alternative to burning fossil fuels yet &amp; until that happens we will keep doing what we do unless we go back to living like cavemen.  You do not see rational none biased discussions on the defaults or larger subs on the site.  All you get is &quot;republicans are trying to drive us off the cliff quicker&quot; when the truth is both sides are guilty &amp; we dont have good alternatives yet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow.  Congrats on being a stereotypical idiot republican.  Let me see if I can explain it in terms simple enough for your uneducated flyover ass.  See, these new fangled solar and weend there type generators, well they prodeuce a thang called lectracity.  That thur lectracity can be used to run all sorts of fun things like cars n boats n planes.  Hell, it can even be used to charge the battery your wife uses in her dildo to actually get pleasure.  </p>

<p>So by usin them there liberal energy sources we have an endless supply of lectracity unlike that crude black gold you conservative type cunts seem to be so fond of ripping out of the only planet we got to live on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You would think the Democrats and the Bernie Bros would want to know who killed him since he was one of them? Julian Assange very strongly hinted that he was the leaker and offered a reward to help find his killed. You don&#39;t have to be a brain surgeon to know what that means. There are a lot of unanswered questions such as why didn&#39;t the DNC let the FBI examine their servers? Recently we found Seth Rich&#39;s twitter and Reddit accounts. His posts show that he was a huge Bernie supporter and hated Hillary. There is a lot of information there that points to motive. Right now the DNC is arguing in court that it has no obligation to be objective and it can rig the primaries in the favor of whoever they want. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>T_D bans and censors people for minor reasons.  They have an ongoing ban now on anything longtime Trump supporter, Paul Joseph Watson posts.   Why?  He strongly disagreed with the Syrian bomb strike.  Many people felt the same.</p>

<p>Question why the US puts Israels interests ahead of its own? Your posts are removed and you risk a ban.  Any critical discussion of Ivanka and Jerad is usually removed as well.</p>

<p>Being critical when Trump goes off course actually helps him!  He got elected vowing in part to put America first, get out of endless wars and crush the establishment.  To hell with political correctness.  His team should know how the people who helped get him elected feel.  He is surrounded largely by vultures now.  Trump has excellent instincts but the people around him have very different interests than the people who got him elected. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was a big time r/the_donald poster and I 100% agree with you on above. I&#39;m sorry you got banned. </p>

<p>I posted dissent in the &quot;domreddit&quot;, but I always tried to make sure it had a positive solution based spin on it. constructive criticism. It&#39;s mostly cause the media bias was so hateful, I believe the mods wanted the sub to be a positive sanctuary from the daily hate. </p>

<p>After the election I moved to pol and twitter more bc trump started having serious issues with the swamp, I have heard/thought of a number of theories of what&#39;s going on - but I was having trouble keeping up with the constructive criticism &quot;positive tone&quot;. That&#39;s why I took a break from the sub. I got banned on twitter and came back to the Donald during Seth Rich, then boom - the sub&#39;s censored. The normalization process makes me feel like the gulags are that much closer. </p>

<p>Sorry for the rant - just a lil buzzed and I hoped to convey not everyone on the sub was the caricature of a Red hat wearing super bro. </p>

<p>Because its a subreddit for Trump supporters, try saying anything pro-Trump at ETS, esist, MarchAgainstTrump, etc and see how fast you get banned. Why aren&#39;t you holding them to the same standard?</p>

<p>Its a much greater offense that basic subs like Politics, News, etc are one sided anti-Trump echo chambers, it didn&#39;t used to be like that. CTR took Politics over before the election and banned most people critical of Hillary, and its been a anti-Trump circlejerk ever since. </p>

<p>Admins told specific subreddits(mostly anti and pro donald subreddits) to not link to each other, this was a rule imposed on ALL of them. If you weren&#39;t allowed to reference politics in the D then you weren&#39;t allowed to do it the other way round either, the left subreddits had the literally same rules applied.</p>

<p>Now obviously you will see users on both sides breaking the rules, that&#39;s always going to happen and only some of it will be removed. But on the D the mods themselves broke rules, that did not happen on other subs.</p>

<p>As a subscriber, I witnessed the mods here make several &quot;Don&#39;t post ____ because we don&#39;t want to get banned&quot; threads at the height of Pizzagate.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which is why this sub rarely, if ever, comes under threat of being banned. If the mods of this sub do nothing else, they surely enforce Reddit&#39;s rules. I&#39;ve never seen this subreddit be threatened with a ban, despite it being bigger than other subreddits that have been banned with similar views. </p>

<p>Due to all of the above, I&#39;m convinced Voat is comprised of edgy 14 year olds, shills payed to fuck over Voat and salty people banned from t_d on reddit. Mods need to do some serious banning over there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>youll get <em>gasp</em> fake imaginary points taken away from slytherin! </p>

<p>you can post whatever you want in politics so long as you arent a cock. That does not shield you from having your opinion judged without a safe space echo chamber to jerk you off though. Imagine if you all hadnt freaked out and locked yourself in a corner how you would actually be shaping conversations rather than being pushed out of them. But rather than participating in politics y&#39;all decided you wanted to bounce your fake news off eachother all day, and now that thats gone EVERYONE ELSE CENSORS US </p>

<p>Which may have even been tolerable, but nuh, T_D was constantly bitching that they werent being included in /All, they wanted to be shoved in everybodies face and then ban any responses to the threads they were slingshotting to the top of the board.

<p>Zack and Mack are the characters in two books available on Amazon.  They are listed as authors and as my pen name.  Currently they are ten feet away sitting in their tank.  Yeah...this household supported Trump.  We red-pilled so many people that The Donald could never imagine.  See...we are vendors at fairs.  We sell tie dye...Old Hippie dude with pony tail and all and when folks come up, its time to red-pill them.  </p>

<p>While I enjoyed perusing the topics at The_Donald, as far as I am concerned they are not the only place on the internet--having been a member of Free Republic since 2001 and lurked even earlier than that...That&#39;s still the number one place on the internet.  </p>

<p>They were a hate sub for the most part, let&#39;s leave them alone. </p>

<p>The adults can come here and behave like the rest of Reddit; sorted.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s not pretend that theD leaving is an attack on free speech for all, because their existence was an attack on free speech.</p>

<p>Once again: I was banned for asking a question. There was no hate in the question. It simply did not conform with their ideals.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t frequent this sub, but I did frequent both The_Donald and other Anti-Trump Subs in the past, and I want to clarify, even though I may be late to the matter here.</p>

<p>When the rule rolled out to stop brigading (Certain subs aren&#39;t allowed to link to other subs, etc), it was in an Anti-Trump sub that I learned about it. They said that they were no longer allowed to directly link T<em>D. These rules _are</em> being enforced in other subs, T_D is just saying it&#39;s not to try to lend their rule breaking some credit.</p>

<p>Anti-Trump subs also tend to avoid doxxing and harassing people, instead sticking to just making a post laughing/calling out something stupid and staying with that. T_D goes above and beyond when it comes to fucking with people, and everyone&#39;s fed up with it.</p>

<p>You can&#39;t punish one sub based off the actions of another sub simply because they have related topics.</p>

<p>T_D was given those rules because of THEIR behavior.  </p>

<p>They were using bots to spam r/all.</p>

<p>The other anti-trump subs were NOT doing this.</p>

<p>They were also using bots to get their bullshit posts to the top of r/news and other subs, that is why they were not allowed to crosspost to other subs.</p>

<p>They got caught spamming Reddit, and the rules were applied to stop that behavior.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And there&#39;s the real rub.  Reddit imposes the rules different on T_D in a way that impacts all subs, because the sitewide &quot;no brigading/doxxing/harassing&quot; rule is actually &quot;no brigading/doxxing/harassing unless it&#39;s against T_D&quot;.  That affects the entire character of the rule and diminishes the integrity of the site.  If you know about this and are being sufficiently honest about yourself, you can&#39;t <em>only</em> say &quot;those damn T_D Trumptards are ruining the site for everyone&quot;, because now you have to live with the reality that a site you might have cared about for years before you even cared about politics now openly caters to the anti-Trump narrative and all the sorts of communities that ally with that.</p>

<p>Plus--and I hope the irony here isn&#39;t lost on anyone--this feeds right into the anti-leftist reactionary movement (which you see in Youtube/minds.com skeptics and parts of Kekistan) when it claims that the ones screaming loudest about oppression are doing quite a lot of it themselves.  But as Jordan Peterson would put it, the leftists don&#39;t give a fuck about anything their opposition could say in the past, present, or future because their aim is not to win over society but to utterly destroy its foundations.</p>
