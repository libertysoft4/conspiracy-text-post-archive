<p>u/spez: Since when did being Anti-Clinton become being a trump supporter?? Sounds like artificial division.. Also people keep trying to convince us that Hillary doesn&#39;t matter anymore... That&#39;s pretty fucked up considering her along with the help of the corrupt democratic establishment essentially lead us to a Trump presidency and republican ,one party controlled, government.. Sounds pretty heavy to me.. I don&#39;t think the Democratic Base is just going to &quot;forget&quot; what happened..</p>

<p>Hillary didn&#39;t win. Who fucking cares what might have happened? President Hillary didn&#39;t bomb Syria. President Hillary didn&#39;t appoint a cabinet full of swamp monsters. President Hillary didn&#39;t swing her dick around North Korea. President Hillary didn&#39;t appoint Chelsea and her husband as advisors. President Hillary hasn&#39;t attacked the freedom of the press. President Hillary didn&#39;t give billions of dollars to the Israelis and then make a deal worth hundreds of billions with a terrorist state to carry out more war crimes with. Might she have done those things if she had won? Probably. But she didn&#39;t win. Trump did. Trump won on a litany of lies. What Hillary might have done is irrelevant. Trump is the President. Trump is reality and the reality is he is no different to Clinton, you just don&#39;t want to face it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ha kid.. The problem with post like yours is that your so narrow minded to believe that fellow free thinkers are trump supporters. Actually, out of ALL 3 candidates we were forced with, I chose the stand behind who I thought was the best HUMAN BEING. I, like majority of America, stayed home on election night. Your post is sounds more like division tactics.</p>

<p>I like many here don&#39;t give 2 FUCKS about sides nor puppet politicians. My post is 100% fact. We all seen the suppression CTR and MSM was pushing. It was straight up censorship. Opinion suppression by shilling. </p>

<p>The front page 1 year ago is not the front page it is now. If the shills are still trying to push their propaganda when it&#39;s obviously failed, could you imagine what the front page would look like if their propaganda worked? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I absolutely agree with you, it would be passed off as being anti American and the subs would be brigaded and shut down. </p>

<p>Clinton conspired and rigged the primary against Sanders, then attempted to blackmail Americans into voting for her because they elevated trump to be the opposition and look at the landscape now days, democrats are demolished from coast to coast and yet the leadership is allowed to retain power. </p>

<p>TPTB keep democrats artistically afloat and continue to manufacture consent and dissent at will. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump supporter or not, why continue to bitch &amp; moan about Hillary?  She lost.  She&#39;s out of the game.  She&#39;s gone.  </p>

<p>The <em>only</em> reason to play the &quot;what if&quot; Hillary hate game is to 1.) serve as a distraction; or 2.) propagate division.</p>

<p>There really is no other point.  So I&#39;d have to agree, this post really was a low effort shitpost.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I&#39;m a shill because I&#39;m speaking negatively about the president on a conspiracy sub, you cracked the case, good job.</p>

<p>He&#39;s literally done nothing but embarass the country, fuck over the lower and middle class, and aligned himself with everything he campaigned against.  The only thing he kept his promise on was the tpp, everything else was just bullshit. He is part of the deep state, hes spewing propaganda from fox and calling anything negative about him fake news, lying, looking like a weak, senile jackass and you cult member trump fan boys eat it up because of &quot;them Libcuck tears.&quot;  </p>

<p>You&#39;re not a patriot, you&#39;re too naive to realize you&#39;re being played. You&#39;re blind, deaf, and dumb yelling that able bodied people are disabled. </p>
