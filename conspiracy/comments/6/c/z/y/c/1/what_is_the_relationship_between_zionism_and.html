    <div class="md"><p>It all goes back to Babylon and Nimrod. Modern Judaism is really Babylonian Talmudism, an esoteric religion. It&#39;s what the Christians call Mystery Babylon. The Freemasons continue to practice Nimrod&#39;s occult teachings. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Definitely, at least one of the Illuminati bloodlines descend from Nimrod, the Rothschilds. I have been researching all about Nimrod lately. I think the Freemasons practice the occult teaching of Nimrod, but the Illuminati descend from the Annunaki bloodlines.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The key to understanding all of this is that the mysteries were originally good. Nimrod (Babylon) begins corrupting it for power, and thus the battle between good and evil after the flood begins.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I think the ancient knowledge that Nimrod had, called Gnosis, goes back all the way to Atlantis before the Flood, where the Annunaki used it to create the Nephilim. The Annunaki came from Mars or the planet that was the asteroid belt, and a catastrophe caused them to come to Earth. If they were on Mars, Saturn would have been their black sun. Anyhow in order to survive they created hybrids with the life here, homo sapiens which were called the Nephilim. After the Flood, I believe Ham mated with a daughter of Cain, and by doing this was cursed. His son Cush would become the father of Nimrod, and Nimrod would go on to marry his mother and have a son.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s my conclusion as well, but we don&#39;t have hard proof. I&#39;ve not seen evidence the Annunaki/Nephilim are extraterrestrial in origin. Christians believe they were demons, others believe it&#39;s a metaphor for the Mystery Babylon system.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe demons are aliens. I believe that Cush was what the Greeks called a Titan. You can see that ancient civilization like Egypt and Greece have depictions of Giants, which I believe are the Nephilim. We know that Goliath is said to have been large too, and iirc the Philistines are from Ham. Although Mizraim is the father of Egypt, it was Nimrod who father the first Pharaoh, post-babel.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>These religions are perversions of sun worship according to Bill Cooper. Check out what he writes in his Mystery Babylon series:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You see, the Mystery School was the original college run by Nimrod in the city of Babylon, and the college was a college of priests who practice the religion of the sun. The college, the adepts, the initiates, the priests were scattered all over the world when Seth, the son of Noah, came with an army and defeated Nimrod, and this is where the legend really comes from because Seth chopped Nimrod up into little pieces and scattered him all over the land. In the legend of the Osirian cycle, Osiris was chopped into fourteen pieces. Isis came to put him back together again and bring him to life. She could find all the pieces save one, the phallus, or the generative force. It is now known as the Lost Word of Freemasonry, and the phallus is represented by the obelisk, the monolith. It is the penis of Osiris, the generative force. It represents the Lost Word of Freemasonry, it represents the Luciferian philosophy. It represents the light, the sun, Lucifer the intellect.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just said the exact same thing above. Perfect summary.</p>

<p>Bill Cooper&#39;s series on Mystery Babylon is good, he just doesn&#39;t realize that not all of the mystery schools are corrupted.</p>

<p>Watch Unto Prayer is a good resource if you want more of a traditional Christian perspective on it. Very well researched, lots of connections to Bible prophecies that will make sense of it for friends who might not like Cooper because he dogs Christianity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To add to this, the Khazarian Mafia hired Oliver Cromwell to kill the king of England and allow the Jews back into England. They then established the Bank of England, which led to the British Empire. They created America. However iirc George Washington realize these people were Satanic and declared war on them in the name of God Almighty! The Russian Tsar blockaded British ships, helping the colonialists. As punishment the Khazarian mafia displaced the Christian Monarchy in Russia and replaced him with an atheistical dictator who would kill the priests and many Russians. This was also revenge for Russia going against the Khazarian Empire, which forced them into Western Europe.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think I understand what you&#39;re saying. As long as you have a broad understanding of what the &quot;Khazarian Mafia&quot; is, and realize that it goes a lot further back into Babylon, that may be a good description.</p>

<p>The takeover of England goes back to Venice. Cromwell wasn&#39;t a bad guy. Washington and Franklin planned the Revolution decades in advance.</p>

<p>You&#39;re correct about Mystery Babylon replacing the Tsars as punishment. Russia has long been one of their main enemies, including today.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Probably also why the Russian narrative is being pushed so hard these days by the media. iirc, the British parliment at the time of Cromwell was corrupt and bought out, those in favour of the king were not allowed to vote, and those against made the decision, I think they were called the Rump. But yeah the Khazars have been killing off the Christian Monarchies of Europe in order to achieve their NWO.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The answer is <strong>kabbalah</strong>  .<br/>
Zionism is complex , and sort of overblown by conspiracy theorists. 
Although they are partially related -  Zionism has a lot to do with Israel more than it really has to do with worldwide power.</p>

<p><strong>Kabbalah</strong> &#39;s secret scripture and its interpretation is at the heart of Masonry as well as various sects of Jewish culture.   It deals with how the world should be lead while also being a bit of a puzzle that can put people in the highest seats of power without really knowing the answers. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The first and most profound hurdle you have to get over (other than conflating Zionism with Judaism) is the fact that there is no Freemasonry.</p>

<p>Freemasonry is a label. You could (and many have) go off tomorrow and start &quot;Mastigia&#39;s Grand Lodge of Masons on Reddit&quot; and that would be Freemasonry.</p>

<p>What we generally call Freemasonry, though, is a loose association of hundreds of Grand Lodges around the world which have a complex web of mutual recognition. But even there, these Grand Lodges are not the same. The Grand Lodge of Sweden is deeply connected to the Lutheran state religion. The Grand Lodge of Georgia (US) thinks that Freemasonry must enforce the Mosaic Law, but only the parts that American Evangelicals like. The United Grand Lodge of England thinks it&#39;s fine for Women&#39;s Freemasonry to be a thing. The Grand Lodge of California has embraced a new wave of &quot;Traditional Observance&quot; and related revivalism in Freemasonry, establishing special Lodges for these, which other Grand Lodges think smell like deviation from the core of the Fraternity.</p>

<p>Being a Freemason, I can tell you that I sometimes wish it were all as simple as conspiracy theorists want to paint it. It might be easier... but then a good deal of what we are about is doing what&#39;s right, not what&#39;s easy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am not one of those that conflate Zionism with Judaism in the least bit. And I was in DeMolay as a kid, I had positive experiences with the Masons. This is actually how this question came up in another forum, I was just under the impression Masons and Zionism were far removed from each other, and this wasn&#39;t as true as I was led to believe.</p>

<p>I think the top of everything is evil and corrupt though. So, Masonry would be no exception.</p>

<p>It seemed you were, since you asked, &quot;What is the relationship between Zionism and Freemasonry?&quot; and gave a link to your source of confusion on this issue which spoke exclusively of Judaism...</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Again, do you have any reason to think this?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s quite the other way around. Obviously Zionism has nothing to do with being ethnically Jewish, nor has it anything to do with being spiritually a member of the Jewish faith. It has to do with one very specific sort of interpretation of the Jewish religious scripture (e.g. that individual Jews have a mandate to re-establish the Jewish mandate, actively, as opposed to waiting for the time to arrive that it is inevitable).</p>

<p>So, no Judaism is not an aspect of Zionism. Zionism is a subset of Jewish religious tradition. There are many non-Zionist religious Jews and many non-religious Jews who do not fit within that category.</p>
