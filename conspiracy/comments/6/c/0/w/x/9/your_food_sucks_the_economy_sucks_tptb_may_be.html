        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Worried about the food you eat? The weed you smoke? Economic meltdown? War? Zombies? </p>

<p>Learn to grow your own food indoors and out. Take a weekend to learn and a weekend to prepare. Then you&#39;ll at least have some skills and a plan while you still have access to YouTube and Google. </p>

<p>Start with 2 methods. For outdoor gardening: Hugelkulture. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.permaculture.co.uk/articles/many-benefits-hugelkultur">https://www.permaculture.co.uk/articles/many-benefits-hugelkultur</a></p>

<p><a href="https://richsoil.com/hugelkultur/">https://richsoil.com/hugelkultur/</a></p>

<p>Video: <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Th0-nMd5kKE">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Th0-nMd5kKE</a></p>

<p>Hugelkulture is a permaculture technique that requires little to no irrigation, builds awesome soil, utilizes yard waste, and is great for perennial plants. They can be as big or as small as you want. You can even hugelkulture in a container on your patio. </p>

<p>But what about the winter and the weather and neighbors who steal your tomatoes and people in apartments? </p>

<p>Kratky. Before you say that&#39;s hydroponic gardening and hydroponics is too complicated, too expensive, and too space consuming just hold on. </p>

<p>Kratky is the easiest cheapest way to grow your own food other than throwing seeds in soil. You can do it inside and out. If indoor growing greens like lettuce and kale, get a good CFL bulb or a sunny window. Just a few supplies and a few steps and you&#39;ll always be able to feed yourself and your family.</p>

<p>Kratky: <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=oDYeffYcVkY">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=oDYeffYcVkY</a></p>

<p>There are a ton of reasons not to grow your own food. I was hilling my potatoes the other day when a neighbor said, &quot;I don&#39;t know why you bother. I can get as many bags of potatoes as I want at the food bank on Wednesdays.&quot; </p>

<p>True that. But if you think there won&#39;t be a food bank during the apocalypse, know how to grow your own. </p>

<p>Maybe you are a single father of 16 children and there isn&#39;t time to garden AND teach Johnny how to zip his pants without getting his pecker caught in the spokes. Ok, turn it into a science lesson. Teach the kids where food comes from. Hold a friendly family tomato growing competition. Use the free labor your loins have given you. </p>

<p>Brown thumb? Do you destroy every living thing you touch? You need to find the one thing you can grow. We all have something. Experiment. Lettuce is easier than a cactus. You can even eat a lot of weeds. </p>

<p>Food foraging is another great skill to have. Know what is edible in your community. Have you ever seen the little Asian ladies pulling weeds out of ditches at the park? Those ladies are going to outlive us all if these are the end times.</p>

<p>Personally, I don&#39;t think this is the end. Something is happening. Weird shit. But I&#39;m not building a bunker. I am learning how to be more self sufficient though because these are skills everyone should have. And the more you can rely on yourself, the less you have to worry about depending on people who don&#39;t have your interests in mind. </p>

<p>Plus gardening can be fun.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great post dude, this is important info. Though it doesn&#39;t seem like an immediate threat if there ever was natural disaster or something that effected the food supply this would be invaluable to know how to survive and be self sufficient.</p>

<p>And you would think especially since our food is modified, that each home would have a mandatory hydroponic garden as part of it. And each home would have a wind mill or solar. </p>

<p>These are things we have to start doing because fossil fuels and their acquisition are harming the earth.</p>

<p>It&#39;s doable. That&#39;s the thing. I love theories about free energy and alien technology but until TPTB get dealt with we&#39;re going to have to do what we can with what we have. Your idea would be amazing in practice. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Awesome post.</p>

<p>I&#39;d add canning as something people growing their own food should know how to do. You don&#39;t have to have a significant amount of space to grow an almost overwhelming amount of some foods; there can be a lot left over that needs processed quickly on top of what can be consumed in the immediate or given away/traded to others.</p>

<p>Canning is the next step when growing your own food and is simply taking the fruits of your labor and making it into food stored in jars for later consumption. This includes jams/jellies/butters to individual fruits/veggies to soups (and that&#39;s if you only grow fruits/veggies). At the end of one season, with proper canning there&#39;s plenty to take you through the next season, if not through the rest of the year when it starts over again. </p>

<p>Home canning done in glass jars leaves you with a product vastly superior to canned items purchased at a grocery. Not only does it reduce money going out for food, it&#39;s also something that can still be gifted/traded/sold. </p>

<p>Disclaimer: Yes, it&#39;s a pain in the ass when you&#39;re faced with a few hundred pounds of fruit that all needs processed pronto, but come winter when you&#39;re craving peach or plum or apricot <em>or whatever fruit</em> something, it&#39;s awesome being able to get a jar out of storage. The added bonus is how something tastes so much better when it&#39;s freshly-picked than its counterpart from the store, so does the stuff in the jar. </p>

<p>The two just go together. Toss a few fruit-bearing trees and some cucumber vines into the gardening experience and canning almost becomes a necessity. (Mmmmm. Homemade pickles make the best burger so much better.)</p>

The Jewish bankers who run this shit have put their personal wealth in Uruguayan banks. Uruguay gets to ride through all of the bullshit &quot;Scott-free&quot;; much the same way that Switzerland wasn&#39;t molested during WW2. But the Swiss are in for a big surprise. Trust me; they won&#39;t know what hit. The Swiss are arrogant Gentiles that are well armed. They won&#39;t let the refugees in. But that is all going to change. So don&#39;t move to Switzerland: move to Uruguay.</p>

<p>a strain of bacterium in soil, Mycobacterium vaccae, has been found to trigger the release of seratonin, which in turn elevates mood and decreases anxiety.

<p>&quot;A research group at Henry Wellcome Laboratories for Integrative Neuroscience and Endocrinology, University of Bristol, Bristol, England, UK has shown that Mycobacterium vaccae stimulated a newly-discovered group of neurons, increased levels of serotonin and decreased levels of anxiety in mice.[1] Other researchers fed live Mycobacterium vaccae to mice, then measured their ability to navigate a maze compared to control mice not fed the bacteria. &quot;Mice that were fed live M. vaccae navigated the maze twice as fast and with less demonstrated anxiety behaviors as control mice&quot;, according to Dorothy Matthews, who conducted the research with Susan Jenks at the Sage Colleges, Troy, New York, USA.[4]&quot;</p>

<p>Bonus:
&quot;Mycobacterium vaccae is in the same genus as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the bacterium which causes tuberculosis.&quot;</p>

<p>Store bought packaged seeds have been genetically altered, they can&#39;t be trusted. We don&#39;t know what&#39;s in them, What they really are in them. If they haven&#39;t been engineered with the intent to kill, they will be by the time comes.</p>

<p>The only food source we can really trust is eating the elites themselves. They will likely be the only thing untainted by any kind of global disaster</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Seeds are no problem. That&#39;s more propaganda designed to create fear.</p>

<p>First, check out stores like Johnny&#39;s Seeds. </p>

<p>Second, learn how to save your own seeds.</p>

<p>Third, learn about perennials - plant it once and have food for years. Sunchokes are a great (but invasive) example. </p>

<p>Fourth, learn what it means to let your greens go to seed. Lettuce will self propagate for years. </p>

<p>The seed scare isn&#39;t real if you learn some basics. Also, check for seed exchanges like at your library. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure. </p>

<p>First thing you do is look for road kill (or in this instance dead farmer John wannabes with their heads blown off for their lima bean yield) </p>

<p>When you find them, they need to be processed quickly. The legs back and arms will likely be the leanest cuts, while the areas around the rib cage should have some nice cuts of meat with good marbling. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t forget the organs- I&#39;d suggest looking up an anatomy book, but the human brain, heart, liver, kidney, and testicles are all edible. Bones can make for useful primitive tools and contain marrow which is edible as well. I would not recommend to mess with the organs if it is your first time skinning and gutting a human- it takes time and the sheer amount of body fat you have to get through makes it much harder than a deer or the like, without cold transport you won&#39;t be able to harvest it all your first time. And I will recommend eating these first.</p>

<p>Cold storage is obviously best, but if you live in the wrong area this won&#39;t be possible. Smoking and curing and dehydration are the best prep methods, but smoking will attract attention, salt may be hard to come by for this reason, etc. They are the best, but not the only option. Works great for tougher stuff. Savages in 3rd world countries often create smoking pits from burying their meat after wrapping in leaves. Likely your best bet if you have a fire source. </p>

<p>Lye is a very commonly produced chemical, one of the most produced there is, and will be something that could be found easily. It is used to preserve things like lutkefisk, century eggs, etc. But it is dangerous if gotten wrong- if you fuck up its basically drain-o. </p>

<p>Take a weekend to learn and a weekend to prepare. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It takes <strong>years</strong> to learn to sustain a family seasonally. It also requires <strong>land</strong>. You are not going to be able to feed a family on container gardening or hydroponics. You need actual soil which rests on the actual earth.</p>

<p>You need to know how much of each thing to grow (no one needs sixteen kohlrabis all ripe at the same time). You need to know how to cook to make use of whatever you grow. Your family needs to find whatever you&#39;re preparing palatable (this is a bigger challenge than you may think - the American food supply is <em>engineered</em> to be tasty while whatever you&#39;ve grown and prepared is <em>home-cooked.</em> Once you have a taste for the one, it is difficult to find enjoyment in the other (this goes both ways).   </p>

<p>And even after you think you&#39;ve got it figured out (ok so garlic dill pickles...four cucumber plants, check, 48 mason jars, check, a 4&#39;x4&#39; section of dill planted at the right time so the seeds are ripening when the cukes are fruiting, check, garlic planted last year so that it&#39;s ready when everything else is, check, fresh canning lids, check, enough time to pickle the day the cucumbers are ready, check, vinegar, check, spices, check, knowledge of how to can safely, check...), nature <em>will</em> throw you a curve ball (hail, drought, deluge, bugs, powdery mildew, frost...). Knowing how to adapt to varied and changing conditions is a large part of gardening.</p>

<p><strong>Find a mentor.</strong> Find someone who has done what you want to do where you want to do it and learn from them. We used to pass this information along generationally. While we still <em>should,</em> no one seems to have the time for that anymore. Gardening is location-specific. Advice from the internet is not going to be as useful as advice from a local gardener.</p>

<p>And in my opinion as a gardener with four decades of experience, hugelkulture is one of those currently trendy methods which is effective in some cases but not the best choice for the vast majority of instances.</p>

<p>And finally, if you&#39;re dead serious about being prepared for a SHTF situation, you must also be prepared to defend your food supply. I will share my potatoes with you if you ask, but not everyone will ask. To paraphrase Bill Burr, if you&#39;re not armed, you&#39;re just growing zucchini for the strongest guy on the block. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some good advice here but I have to disagree with your basic premise which seems to be don&#39;t bother because it&#39;s too hard and people will just steal your food anyway. Too many people are turned off of growing their own food because &quot;experts&quot; keep telling them they can&#39;t. That&#39;s bullshit. </p>

<p>Like your example. People learning to grow their own food don&#39;t need to know how to grow dill or even cucumbers. Those are nice but luxurious really. Start with some greens and radishes. But just start learning now so if you need it in the future the knowledge is there.</p>

<p>Yes, people are limited by time and resources but there are ways around both of those when we get creative and work together. Maybe it&#39;s an attitude change our culture needs more than food production alternatives. </p>

<p>I certainly never said &quot;don&#39;t bother.&quot; Just have a realistic idea of the undertaking. You can&#39;t manufacture time. We all have the same amount of minutes in a day and from there, it&#39;s priorities. Gardening and preparing nutrient-dense whole foods for a family takes time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My girlfriend and I are learning to garden from nothing. We aren&#39;t consulting the internet, and we&#39;re making tons of mistakes. But when things go right, it&#39;s incredibly rewarding.</p>

<p>My snow peas are finally producing. While it&#39;s not enough to supply more than treats, it&#39;s a great feeling. You get a strange connection to nature doing this, eating the literal fruits of your labor.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll have to try this horgethingy when I get more space.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why not just get a large portion of the American Population to stop paying Federal Income Tax.  If you want to drain the swamp, it would be easier to remove the water (IE Money) that they use to swim in.  </p>

<p>If you got say 2 million people to do so, it would be impossible for the federal government to prosecute or incarcerate all of them.  </p>

<p>I have already checked with accounting and each state is unique, but it is possible to have no federal funds withheld, and only withold FICA, SS, and your state income tax witheld from your pay.</p>

<p>I am actually going to think about how to make this viral.</p>

<p>The argument is, if you want to stop the domestic spying and the bombing of other people in other countries that you don&#39;t know on your dime, then stop paying federal taxes.</p>

<p>that each home would have a mandatory hydroponic garden as part of it. And each home would have a wind mill or solar.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s doable. That&#39;s the thing. I love theories about free energy and alien technology but until TPTB get dealt with we&#39;re going to have to do what we can with what we have. Your idea would be amazing in practice. </p>
