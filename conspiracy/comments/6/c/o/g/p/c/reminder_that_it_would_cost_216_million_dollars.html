    <div class="md"><p>It is my opinion that both parties are employed to serve the same agenda. A simple way of explaining it is both parties work against the interest of the people but use different strategies and rhetoric. Who was the last president who&#39;s actions promoted peace? The interests of the people are served by neither party, and yet they are presented as our only choices. Our democracy has been subverted by the interests of a greedy self serving elite.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How fucking deluded can you be. If Trump doesn&#39;t want to ensure the safety of every single AMERICAN in the United States then he shouldn&#39;t have ran for president. </p>

<p>But it&#39;s obvious caring for our citizens wasn&#39;t his top priority. He&#39;s a business man. He doesn&#39;t give a fuck about you. He doesn&#39;t give a fuck about me. He doesn&#39;t give a fuck about the citizens of Flint. </p>

<p>He cares only about making money. The same as every other business man since the beginning of time. Where in the process of being brainwashed by him did you all stop realizing this?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i feel he cares more about me than the last president did.  more than hillary or bernie did.  both of them just wanted to take more of what i earn to spend on others. same with obama.  i hardly see how that is &quot;caring for me&quot; either, so what can ya do? </p>

<p>and again, WHAT HAPPENED IN FLINT IS NOT THE PRESIDENTS FAULT AND NOT HIS PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY TO FIX.  thats not how it works, thats not how any of this works.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>what in the actual fuck are you talking about? none of that has a god damn thing to do with the fact that it is NOT the presidents job to fix a fucking water issue in flint, michigan.</p>

<p>there is all sorts of awful shit happening in the US &amp; the world, is the president supposed to fix all of that too?  because you know, he totally can and stuff.</p>

<p>double wtf as to what &quot;my side&quot; is exactly.  and again, how is any of what you said the slightest bit relevant to ANYTHING AT ALL?  great, safety nets are apparently thin (which is an entirely different subject and i would disagree with seeing as how we have generational welfare and people who dont really ever work but still live a better life than 80% of the world. doesnt seem all that thin in the grand scheme of things).... but ok, i see what that has to do with bad water in flint i guess.  thanks for valuable your input?</p>

<p>As for 54 billion. He increased military DEFENCE budget to protect the US. Which I personally don&#39;t find anything wrong with that if it was for other military projects or a different part, sure I would be, but that is not the case. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Every gun that is made, every warship launched, every rocket fired signifies, in the final sense, a theft from those who hunger and are not fed, those who are cold and are not clothed.</p>

<p>This world in arms in not spending money alone.</p>

<p>It is spending the sweat of its laborers, the genius of its scientists, the hopes of its children.</p>

<p>The cost of one modern heavy bomber is this: a modern brick school in more than 30 cities.</p>

<p>It is two electric power plants, each serving a town of 60,000 population.</p>

<p>It is two fine, fully equipped hospitals.</p>

<p>It is some 50 miles of concrete highway.</p>

<p>We pay for a single fighter with a half million bushels of wheat.</p>

<p>We pay for a single destroyer with new homes that could have housed more than 8,000 people.</p>

<p>This, I repeat, is the best way of life to be found on the road the world has been taking.</p>

<p>This is not a way of life at all, in any true sense. Under the cloud of threatening war, it is humanity hanging from a cross of iron.&quot;</p>

<p>-President Dwight D. Eisenhower &quot;The Chance for Peace&quot;</p>
