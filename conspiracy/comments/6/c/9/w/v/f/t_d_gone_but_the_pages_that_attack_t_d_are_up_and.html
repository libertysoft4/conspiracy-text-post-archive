        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I would assume people here are noticing this, but if you go to ALL, everyday there is at least 1-3 top posts from pages that attack T_D or try to discredit it. Yet when i go to any of those subs, their subscribers are very little and somehow the likes on those front pages gets over 15k. Anyone with a brain can see it is voter manipulation. Yet when i go to T_D all of their front page are usually 10k+ for the first page. </p>

<p>I dont like Trump, infact i can care less for him, but the censorship reddit is going towards to in the past few years is quite Digg like. Too many shills and inflated likes are taking over. </p>

<p>The Conspiracy is.. reddit was looking to make T_D implode and so they found a way to do it. Also it makes reddit bottom line fatter. Over the past few months, there has been articles and videos on how mods are able to sell their souls to sway the narrative. I would imagine reddit&#39;s board are doing the same. </p>

<p>By imploding i mean push T_D to go against the terms and condition reddit has for its users.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is such a dumb post. Also, I love how any argument against T_D always just boils down to &quot;I don&#39;t like how they use stickies&quot;. </p>

<p>For a start their evidence is that r/the_Donald doesn&#39;t appear on r/all. Instead of jumping to the logical conclusion that the algorithm created to keep them off r/all was successful in keeping them off r/all they made up some vague theory about stickies.</p>

<p>There&#39;s​ really nothing to substantiate the claim that they&#39;re abusing stickies either. Even the OP concedes that they&#39;re just carrying on exactly how they did before.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It wasn&#39;t their spam that got them restricted, it was the vote manipulation, doxxing, and bridgading. Other anti-trump subs got similar strict rules at T_D, but they actually followed said rules. T_D went rouge a few days ago and started blatantly breaking the site rules. Then the mods decided to play the drama card and go private. I hear their voat move is a solid 3k people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sounds like every other subs policy. I&#39;ve seen this tactic in many subs besides The Donald. I&#39;ve seen people banned just because they were subbed to here or The Donald or some other sub the mods don&#39;t agree with which IMO is fine and fair. They clearly just want to hear one side so stick with the one side of you&#39;re in that sub. How echo chambers and safe spaces work. It&#39;s like that on twitter and FB so I don&#39;t see you&#39;re argument here. You want to open discuss your ideas I think Conspiracy is a place you can do that if imaginary internet points don&#39;t bother you because this sub is brigaded by the elite everyday. People still see sides when there isn&#39;t. It&#39;s rulers and the power hungry who smell their moms soul vs the people they want to control</p>

<p>Donald Trump has literally issued statements against free speech, as well as freedom of the press, freedom of assembly, and freedom of religion.</p>

<p>The Donald denies it but the first person they need to fight to preserve free speech is their president.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>where it&#39;s currently being attacked viciously by the media and universities.</p>

<p>This is not true.  Fox News is the most watched cable news network and vehemently supports Donald Trump.  The anti-Trump Universities are private organizations, free to give their opinions as any business is under Trump&#39;s own rules.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Donald was set up by rule to be a pro Donald sub</p>

<p>Setting a subreddit up strictly so it can limit free speech does not mean that subreddit is not limiting free speech when it exercises those rules.</p>

<p>UC Berkeley literally invited pro-Trump speakers, it&#39;s not anti-Trump and hasn&#39;t limited free speech.  The <em>students</em> were evidently unhappy with those speakers but their actions weren&#39;t sanctioned by the university and if it responds to its students making trouble that&#39;s an extremely different problem.   Yale is what I had in mind which has publicly announced some anti-Trump sentiments but also happens to be a private university.  If you have a public university that has actually officially announced being against Trump, I&#39;d like to know.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not &quot;worried about T_D banning a few trolls,&quot; I&#39;m just pointing ought that A) they don&#39;t only ban trolls and B) it&#39;s hypocritical to claim you are trying to preserve free speech when you can&#39;t even organize a forum without censoring relevant discussion engaged in good faith.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Freedoms are disappearing</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What freedoms?  Guns?  The right isn&#39;t doing shit to preserve gun rights, with all the shit they have forced through for their agenda gun legislation is mired in committee.  Every other freedom at risk is at risk because the right is stealing them away from people and selling them to corporations.  You can claim it &quot;pisses off the right&quot; and &quot;the left loves it&quot; but the only people and the only politicians I&#39;ve seen speak against the right killing net neutrality and appointing some of the least qualified possible cabinet members has been on the left except for a brief period of time before the_Donald banned everyone who dared &quot;concern trolled&quot; by stating they weren&#39;t happy about that.</p>

<p>So... support your BS.  What freedoms are disappearing and what is the right doing to protect them?  Because as far as I have seen the right is against far more freedoms than the left is.</p>

I know they exist and I know they are frivolous because of how easily I was banned and how easy it was to get back.  Disinformation is real.

<p>As I&#39;ve said, their bar was higher and I won&#39;t dispute that. I&#39;m just not sure if I blame them. It&#39;s clear how Reddit, as a whole, view Trump supporters. If you let that attitude run rampant you just become the next ETS and that&#39;s not what they were there for. </p>

<p>I never claimed they didn&#39;t delete comments and such. In fact I said some mods were over sensitive. Your experience backs up the very thing I claimed. Still there&#39;s no evidence the mods deleted the comments (though they likely did). It is possible for you to delete your own. </p>

<p>Only claimed it&#39;s not nearly as bad as everyone makes it out be. If everyone were to be believed, Reddit is the true bastion​ of free speech and T_D is North Korea. Reality, and my experiences there, do not bear that out. </p>

<p>Again -- that doesn&#39;t mean they were perfect. Far from it. They were heavy handed at times. Some mods were absolutely over sensitive. I&#39;m just not sure yet if I blame them. </p>

<p>The comments in this thread, and on conspiracy over the past few hours, show how Reddit users view Trump and his supporters. Was T_D supposed to let comments like that take over their sub?</p>

<p>If so why aren&#39;t we all bitching that Feminism doesn&#39;t let their sub get overrun by anti-Feminists and MRAs?</p>

<p>For example, politics only bans for name calling, foul language, shill accusations.

People who questioned whether it was a good idea were banned, even if they were reasonable and had a lot of community support.</p>

<p>People are still divided on the Syria strikes. You can disagree while still being supportive. There was a huge debate on the don about it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because it is a fallacious argument lacking of merit.  the_D makes it very clear in its rules that it is not a place for debate, but rather serves the purpose of venerating a single candidate.  There is no intention prescribed or assumed that it is place for vigorous debate, unlike an open ended sub dedicated to the DEBATE of politics. Let me enlighten you to the dynamic of the &quot;safe Space&quot; you seem to have lost site of.  No on gives a care if you choose to find your solitude in a closed community of like minded people. In fact it is the American way. Case in point, ethnic churches, neighborhoods, and clubs of all sorts, where people given the choice, choose to self segregate. No that is not the complaint at all, but rather when ones idea of a &quot;Safe Space&quot; Leeches into the domain of public discourse that is where  the problem lies   </p>

<p>Simply put the OP made a false argument of equivalence, and a simple observation of post histories illustrates it is not out of ignorance but rather an agenda clearly shown through the behavior of cataloging screen shots from a random page of a then shuttered Sub.   </p>

<p>P.S. You said shill, not me, but subconscious or not I will take your assessment as an affirmation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Who is otherwise occupied in Saudi right now, under the microscope in the investigation and maybe just doesn&#39;t have time to shitpost the way he used to. </p>

<p>It seemed to me that the status quo had been shifting. The bots that autoposted tweets and headlines dominated the content and user activity was down. People have become distracted and confused and the &quot;T_D show&quot; was getting more challenging to maintain. I theorized earlier in the week that Kushner ran the sub and change was in the air.</p>

<p>How do you go out on top?</p>

<p>You come up with an ultimatum to build-up to the event, stage a showdown and ride off into the sunset. The admins might even have been in on it. When it went private I knew that was it; T_D isn&#39;t coming back.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The other option is that the mods are controlled. We all know Trump was not supposed to win the election. The same people working for the DNC, who bought up the mods on almost every other political sub on reddit, certainly would have tried to buy TD mods with plans to shut the sub down afterward, to quell criticism of the newly elected Clinton (they did the same with Sanders subs when it became clear they successfully stole the nomination). But oh no, Trump won! Controlled opposition became the sub of the <em>President</em>. What to do? Same mods. Then stuff comes out damaging the DNC and they strangely go private for no reason. Makes you wonder. </p>

<p>Maybe they just want people to think that, I don&#39;t know.</p>

<p>If one is abusing a flaw in the system, the system is at fault for letting it happen simply because <em>anyone else could&#39;ve done it</em>. T_D was just the first one to discover and abuse it.</p>

<p>Relevant example: hackers who find vulnerabilities (generally) are given prizes, not punished for it.</p>

<p>reddit is akin to a private road (or parking lot) that is open to public traffic.</p>

<p>so does reddit inherits rules or guidelines that public spaces enjoy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I saw a few post on T_D were users were doxxed simply because of posts they made. It would be somewhat easy to find out information depending on people user names or if they posted in local subreddits or had identifying pictures.</p>

<p>Some claimed they messaged the admins yet none response was given.</p>

<p>There is so much hate for T_D, but they were essentially forced to make their own subreddit. On top of that the algorithm was been tweaked so many times to prevent it from reaching <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a>. Not to mention Spez had admitted to editing pro-Trump comments at times.</p>

<p>They were more or less removed from <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> entirely. Say what you want but anti-Trump subreddits are just as bad. Until a few days ago with the Seth Rich most T_D rarely made it to <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> while anti-T_D subreddits consistently did.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ultimately, this political divide will be what ruined reddit.</p>

<p>It&#39;s fine to have s4p and The_Donald and even shilled-out politics, but once you let it bleed into EVERY other subreddit, from sports to video games to hobbies, it ruins the entire site.</p>

<p>Reddit admins should realize that there is a huge majority of people who like to do things like watch movies and sports with zero political appeal. ESPN&#39;s downtrend is fair evidence of that, as they&#39;ve over-politicized lately too.</p>

<p>Some people just want to be entertained, enjoy their vices, and not care about the scum that run the nation. If they can&#39;t have that in a sub where they once just enjoyed cat pics, then it is eventually game over for the site.</p>

<p>Yep there a absolutely a double standard as anti-Trump subs get away with Reddit TOS violations every day while T_D has special rules only it must obey. But capitulation is not the answer. Now T_D is gone and at least half a dozen NEW anti Trump spam subs are all over <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a>, bringing the total up to god only knows how many.</p>

<p>As a T_D subscriber it sure as hell looks like we lost this battle, thanks to mods who finally caved in to the relentless triggering from astroturfers. For shame. The special rules applied to T_D never bothered me, if they have to impose multiple handicaps on us in order to stand a fighting chance then so be it. I took it as a compliment. But now T_D is gone, if they bring it back who knows if it&#39;ll ever regain its momentum.</p>

<p>There is so much hate for T_D, but they were essentially forced to make their own subreddit. On top of that the algorithm was been tweaked so many times to prevent it from reaching <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a>. Not to mention Spez had admitted to editing pro-Trump comments at times.</p>
