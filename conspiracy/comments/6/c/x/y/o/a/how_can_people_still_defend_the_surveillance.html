    <div class="md"><p>And if they&#39;ve not commited a crime, you can&#39;t exactly scare them into NOT blowing themselves up in a crowd of people. There&#39;s no consequence.</p>

<p>And if you start arresting them, everyone in r/conspiracy would start bemoaning the fact that law enforcement are rounding up people for their thoughts.</p>

<p>There&#39;s no winning. The answer is the education of common sense. Or giving more powers to the government to deport natural born citizens, which will go down great with everyone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If they are going to spy on people and are aware they are dangerous they should be taking better preventative measures. How do they know they are threat but they don&#39;t notice when something is out of place or they are planning an attack? It&#39;s hard to suspend disbelief on that.</p>

<p>Either way if they can&#39;t prevent things then it is pointless. It&#39;s a waste of money and gives a dangerous amount of power to accomplish nothing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not that hard to suspend disbelief if you realise that surveillance probably doesn&#39;t mean his whole house is bugged with audio and cameras and you bring it down to something a little more realistic (like tracking purchases and flights, coupled with reports from family members).</p>

<p>And frankly, you don&#39;t hear about foiled terrorist plots, probably because advertising those arrests just gives terrorists martyrs to look at, and makes them more privy to how they were tracked and arrested in the first place. And places like this subreddit would be constantly bemoaning the fact that the police are arresting people for potentially commiting crimes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They have access to every connected device a person uses. If this person texts, uses email, talks into their phone, buys anything (location and online habits can be tracked) they have access to that, no warrant needed. From there it is easy to shut down an attack.</p>

<p>If you want to argue that this person doesn&#39;t do or say anything that will be suspicious enough to look into, why are they aware of this person in the first place? Not that you were arguing that, but just in case.</p>

<p>In the end it doesn&#39;t matter. There is no excuse for not having better intel on most of these attacks. Like for example that airport shooter, how the fuck does that even happen? He goes on very peculiar flights and somehow ends up with a bag of rifles in the airport shooting people.</p>

<p>This is why people don&#39;t believe this is a matter of the surveillance being a failure but rather that they are allowing these attacks or false flags to happen intentionally. The level of incompetence required for them to fail in these situations we know of is just too much to accept without more answers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My belief is that the raids should have happened long ago. Not after the fact. One theory is that the attacker went to Libya as a distraction, MI5 didn&#39;t know they were back in town, hence how they were able to slip through the nets. Still, if they knew of the travelling ahead of time, they could have raided the houses while in Libya. This whole story is fucked. The parents need to be investigated as well, get all the info they can from the brother, and find all of these losers</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes remember that Germany, Sweden, UK all have cases of treating muslim immigrants differently than the rest of population. Plus &quot;refugees&quot; often enter EU illegally, no passport control or fake passports, refugees even talked about it on camera, look it up! It is a win win situation. Elites flood europe with refugees, with them come high risk individuals, who have big hate for western countries, they commit terror attacks (no need to orchestrate false flags, just let everything happen on it self) create hateful and divided masses, send troops to the middle east to help israel expand, bomb the shit out of targeted countries, since &quot;all civilians&quot;are fleeing to europe.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most western terrorist attacks are home grown though. 2nd generation. Most 1st gen reffo&#39;s are taxi drivers and 7/11 attendants.. it&#39;s their disgruntled kids with no dads because they&#39;re working 18 hrs a day and uneducated baby-factory mums that dont raise them at all.. of course they&#39;re going to grow up angry, they&#39;re second class citizens with no future. Same thing that happened with black Americans in the 80&#39;s and 90&#39;s with the crack epidemic. Don&#39;t think for a second it isn&#39;t engineered that way, it gives the middle class something to be genuinely angry about. Don&#39;t hate the players, hate the game.</p>

<p>*THE United States has been narrowly saved from lethal terrorist plots in recent years — or so it has seemed. A would-be suicide bomber was intercepted on his way to the Capitol; a scheme to bomb synagogues and shoot Stinger missiles at military aircraft was developed by men in Newburgh, N.Y.; and a fanciful idea to fly explosive-laden model planes into the Pentagon and the Capitol was hatched in Massachusetts.</p>

<p>But all these dramas were facilitated by the F.B.I.*</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The FBI, NOT Islamic crazies, are solely behind the terrorism we see in those articles.  Let that sink in for a second.  The FBI is behind the spoiled terrorism plots.  Once you realize that the FBI is using patsies for fake terrorism entrapment events, then you will realize that given the highly bizarre and outright fake nature of most &quot;terrorist&quot; acts, it&#39;s not unusual to conclude that the FBI is behind almost all of them.   </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I mean Im capable of killing OJ Simpson&#39;s wife. Doesnt mean I ever did it.<br/>
Interesting how you are using yourself as the FBI in this analogy.  Yes, you are capable of killing OJ&#39;s wife and it doesn&#39;t mean you did it.  But, if you were found to have repeatedly have attempted to kill OJ&#39;s wife with spoiled plots where you were the mastermind behind it and then one day she ends up dying, you would be the prime suspect.  Similarly, if the FBI are continuously trying to entrap low IQ Muslims, then when a real terrorist act happens, the FBI are on the top of the suspect list.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Did I ever claim that it was a false flag in this post????? No, I didn&#39;t... maybe it was a real attack. Does that change the fact that this terrorist was known to law enforcement prior to the incident? NO. That&#39;s my point... Ill look into the stats re foiled terror attacks in America (if there even is any info about it) but I&#39;d like for you to explain how every attacker in recent years has been a known potential threat to law enforcement and why they have yet to stop an attack. What&#39;s the point of excessive surveillance if it has proven itself to be useless for the reasons they claim it&#39;s necessary time and time again? We heard about the case in Germany where they prevented an attack, so clearly governments are coming out and announcing that their surveillance works when it actually does prevent casualties but I can&#39;t recall any instances where we&#39;ve been informed of American law enforcement preventing attacks by individuals known to LE agencies. I&#39;ll research to confirm this but please feel free to provide examples if you know of any. </p>

<p>Sorry but until we see that the surveillance state is actually worth the rights that we&#39;ve had to sacrifice, I will whole heartedly stand against it because I see that clearly it doesn&#39;t fucking work. Thanks for trying to critique the entire sub based on this post though. </p>

<p>It is rather simple. Law Enforcement knows about many people and their ties, past, etc. That doesn&#39;t mean you can just arrest them for the hell of it. </p>

<p>It also doesn&#39;t mean you can do surveillance on them each all the time: not talking automated data collection - remember, you need humans to analyze that information and make decisions. That costs money and it takes each one time to analyze the immense trove of data. </p>

<p>How many people 24x7 do you think the government employs to just read and analyze, translate, track, etc? Now think of how many people they are &#39;aware&#39; of. Going by the alt-right version of things, any muslim in the UK was a suspect and had to be watched. How many of them are there VS human analysts?</p>

There are hierarchies of the most dangerous down to &#39;radical ideas, no action&#39; etc. The police foil alot more terror attacks than you think, but never tell the press.</p>

<p>Like the other guy said, you can&#39;t just found people up and arrest or shoot them before they commit a crime.</p>

<p>There are thousands of people with known terror links. Internal agencies can&#39;t have teams following every single one of them all day.</p>
