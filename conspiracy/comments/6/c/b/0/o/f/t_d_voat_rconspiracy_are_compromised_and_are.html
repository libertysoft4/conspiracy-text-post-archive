<p>So you are flat-out saying, with no ambiguity at all, that people who support Trump are welcome here but those who do not would be undesirable, and that you believe the mods are acting in a way to push that agenda and shape the community in that direction.</p>

<p>I can testify to this. I&#39;m a Trump supporter (although I don&#39;t agree with everything he&#39;s done) and I got banned from <a href="/r/the_donald">/r/the_donald</a> for ....  something ... I&#39;m not sure what. If they would ban me, they&#39;ll ban anyone, because I do support Trump.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been on that sub since way back in 2016, I think it&#39;s more of a training wheels deal when people curious about Trump or who even dislike Trump go to find out about Trump. Its purpose I wouldn&#39;t say is to discuss core stances or positions, but they do give nods to commentators who are willing to do a deep dive, people like Ben Shapiro are harsh on Trump but you wouldn&#39;t get called a shill for appreciating Shapiro.                                                                 When it comes to t-d being a &#39;free space&#39; with &#39;free ideas&#39;, well the first thing I imagine if &#39;dissenting&#39; views are allowed grow on the sub is that it will be bombarded by all sides of Reddit. People from tech subs will have their own issues with Trump , people amped up from r/politics and other anti-trump subs will do whatever on t-d, the result will be posts with 1k upvotes and 1k comments constantly.                                                             I personally don&#39;t mind people&#39;s views on any matter and don&#39;t get offended unless it&#39;s something extremely personal. If other subs want to impose their own rules on their sub and curate a certain space for a certain type of internet user, then I have no issue with that which is what I think t-d is doing. I believe mods have the right to treat users to their sub in whichever way they choose, but Reddit admins should be treating all subs fairly and equally. Which clearly they haven&#39;t done for quite a while now. People are arguing in favor of admins putting pressure on this one sub on the basis that it isn&#39;t some free speech absolutist space, it&#39;s just a shitty situation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m a Trump supporter too and agree with a lot of what your saying. The point about mentioning Muslims vs Kushner, have you considered the fact that ones a group and the other is a close advisor and son in law to Trump. Also my opinion on why there is a slant against Muslims for example is that most recent high profile cases of &#39;hate speech&#39; tend to revolve around Muslims, so I guess they&#39;re doubling down. Much like r/dankmemes or r/imgoingtohellforthis targeting blacks and Jews which are hot Button topics.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A lot of people don&#39;t realize this... in fact I don&#39;t even this r/the_donald realizes this, but this was a revolution of information, hundreds of thousands of people talked about satanic worshiping, pedos, backroom deals, corruption, 2 party system being a sham, all of this took place on the Donald last summer until now, I don&#39;t know if Donald Trump himself is the savior they think he is, but what that community accomplished goes way beyond that, this is why that community certainly belongs on r/conspiracy.</p>

<p>In fact today Trump is in Saudi Arabia signing a big weapons deal, if you go to the Donald sub you&#39;ll see 75% of people are not happy about it and speaking out, this is what accidental awakening does, in not sure this was their intention, but this is what happened, r/conspiracy should be there for our brothers, I like Trump, but I am not 100% sure of all his actions, but what I am sure about is the momentum and the revolution of the mind and information that the people of the Donald are going through. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not at all. Here&#39;s what really happened:</p>

<p>There was once a large and vibrant independent conspiracy community online. There were always some ridiculous and fake conspiracies mixed in -- but those were tolerated rather than censored.</p>

<p>Both parties came along to push a narrative that all conspiracies are crazy.</p>

<p>More recently, the Republican Party funneled a good chunk of the conspiracy community into looking only at those conspiracies which made Democrats look bad. I am talking about sites like InfoWars and ZeroHedge, but of course also about pure partisan sites like Breitbart.</p>

<p>In response to both the fact that online conspiracy boards began to look more like Republican campaigns and the fact that some of the conspiracies really were crazy, Democrats stepped up their anti-conspiracy ridicule.</p>

<p>Then, along comes Donald Trump, the &quot;outsider.&quot; He is going to expose these conspiracies and work for the &quot;little guy&quot; -- something he has <em>never</em> done. But in the desperation of the population in a continued weak economy, Donald Trump fools some percentage of the conspiracy community, and squeaks out a slim win.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you missed the major point of my comment. </p>

<p>Basically what it&#39;s trying to say is this; </p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t matter if they are Republican or Democrat, doesn&#39;t matter if Trump was the reason behind their interest in researching given &quot;facts&quot; by media or politicians, trump doesn&#39;t matter, what matters is that more and more people are awakened to the state of our lives, the &quot;deep state&quot; that makes decisions behind closed doors without any oversight. </p>

<p>This is what&#39;s important here, this is why at the end of the day, even if Trump is a liar like all the other politicians, because what he started even he can&#39;t close Pandora&#39;s box at this point.</p>

<p>I said the exact opposite! The awakening that was taking place earlier has been stunted. </p>
