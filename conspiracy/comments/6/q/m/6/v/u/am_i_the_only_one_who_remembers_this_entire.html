    <div class="md"><p>By Russia narrative I&#39;m referring to our nation constantly talking about it because it became associated with his impeachment. What I recall before that was Trump stating we should get along with Putin and I can see how it would be easy to take that and run with it in a way that makes him look bad. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not defending Trump, there may be real collusion. I&#39;m just studying how Narrative are born and for how much stuff has happened you&#39;d think we&#39;d have something on trump by now. </p>

We get very small leaks my suspicious sources but who really knows what&#39;s going on in this investigation. None of us are about to know. This &quot;narrative&quot; has been talked about for some time because of Trumps business dealings with oligarchs and him expressing interest in building property in Moscow. This is why disclosing everything up front is so important. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, you couldn&#39;t really associate this discussion with his impeachment before he was elected and sworn in, so that sets a lower limit on that timeline. </p>

<p>If I recall, the Trump-Russia connection has been an issue of debate dating back to the Republican primaries. We&#39;ve also just celebrated a year since the famous RNC convention in which Trump <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2016/07/27/the-democrats-just-fell-for-trumps-russian-email-hack-bait-commentary.html">asked Russia to release the hacked DNC E-mails</a> (just to point out that he did more than say he wants to get along with them).</p>

<p>I think this narrative/story was just left undeveloped in the public eye as the Democratic campaign efforts for the general election focused on bringing more easily-verifiable dirt on Trump into the limelight (e.g the Access Hollywood tapes), rather than talking about what was then a pretty flimsy connection.</p>
</div>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it began with people noticing odd coincidences and connections, which put everything under a magnifying glass........ Which is what every politician, and particularly presidential candidates go through. Trump&#39;s public statements didn&#39;t help either. </p>

<p>People were talking about Trump&#39;s connections to Russia long before the dossier gained attention. 
The dossier is only a small part of the overall picture, as is the alleged hack into the DNC. Even if you totally eliminate those from the picture, there&#39;s an overwhelming volume of evidence.</p>

<p>It&#39;s gotten to the point we&#39;re at now for two reasons. Number one, because of the evidence that exists and number two, because of Trump&#39;s lies, denials and obviously deceptive behaviours. The narrative from the White House until a couple of months ago was that there was no collusion with Russia, period....... Then it shifted to if there was collusion, Trump didn&#39;t know about it....... And now they&#39;re shifting it again, to collusion isn&#39;t illegal..... And Trump commenting via Twitter that his power to pardon people is absolute.</p>

<p>The meeting with Junior, Manafort and Kushner was damning. You have a Russian lobbyist that&#39;s been working against the sanctions for years with ties to money laundering cases, the FSB and high level government officials meeting with the Trump campaign promising to help them....... Then shortly afterwards Trump started talking about a big news story about Hillary, and started publicly asking the Russians to release the hacked emails.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not really so much a narrative than it is looking at the timeline and the available evidence. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s a link from July of last year: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/27/us/politics/spy-agency-consensus-grows-that-russia-hacked-dnc.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/27/us/politics/spy-agency-consensus-grows-that-russia-hacked-dnc.html</a></p>

<p>This includes a quote from John Podesta accusing Trump of having a &quot;bromance&quot; with Putin. The Democrats were definitely trying to tie Trump to Russia before the debates in the general election. And didn&#39;t Putin lobby for Russia before? </p>

<p>I&#39;m having trouble finding earlier sources than that at the moment, but I recall reading leaked material last year that indicated a plan to attack Trump for his relationship to Putin/Russia. I believe it was the opposition research that Guccifer 2.0 released, but I&#39;m having a hard time locating that now. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>First article on the dossier came out Oct 31 on Mother Jones. &quot;Unverified opposition research by former British spy&quot; or something along those lines, no details or quotations. (What I&#39;ve always found very odd is that this was also the date of the Reddit-born/Slate-covered Alfa Bank-Trump Tower-Spectrum Health server matter, which the NYT via the FBI smushed just a few hours after the story started circulating. It was also the date of a WL Podesta release, promoted by the soon to be president. Lots of activity for whatever reason.)</p>

<p>Obviously BuzzfeedNews&#39; release of the full dossier on January 11 represented the full launch of the Trump-Russia conspiracy theories to the wider populace, but buzz was circulating long before, and his connections to Russia were being investigated long before. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Leaked documents from last year showed that the Democrats had a plan to attack Trump as being too close with Russia as far back as the primaries. I think the Guccifer2.0 stuff showed this first, but the Wikileaks release of DNC emails also showed this. They came up with this plan because polls showed that Clinton&#39;s ties to Russia were her greatest weakness. She took millions from Kremlin-connected sources, including half a million paid directly to her husband for a &quot;speech&quot;, while her State Dept was in the middle of approving the transfer of Uranium One to Russia. In addition, Clinton&#39;s campaign chair was John Podesta, and the Podestas have suspicious links to Russia as well. </p>

<p>So yeah, that&#39;s why the media is all RUSSIA RUSSIA RUSSIA now. Because Clinton had suspicious ties to Russia and her campaign decided to pretend it was actually Trump who had those suspicious ties. </p>
