        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>recently the trump adminstration has had some shakeups to staff lately.  we all know about the secretary of press in and out 10 days later deal.  plus the way he publicly calls out sessions, the resignation of rinse penis etc.  add to this the norks using a new long range missile that very likely could hit our mainland, russia reducing the amount of diplomats, iran taking a larger role in syria all of the sudden, the MASSIVE failure of the healthcare bill here at home,  i think other countries are paying close attention to this and seeing trump as weak.  if you add to that the fact that he has given to russia and got NOTHING IN RETURN in the form of allowing assad to stay in power AND agreeing to stop arming &quot;moderate rebels&quot;, also trump has applied significant pressure to china and russia to deal with north korea, something they have refused to do which also makes trump look weak.  </p>

<p>in addition to all of this, governments are beginning to go straight to congress to negotiate things like trade deals like france did recently (i cant find the article on it right now).  </p>

<p>to me it looks like the rest of the world sees trump as weak, is pushing him around a bit, and trump is a weak negotiator on the world stage. althought i wonder if the fact that he is running on a barebones state dept has anything to do with it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Single-payer healthcare and cheap or free higher education work just fucking great in other countries. Medicare for all would cost 20 trillion less over 10 years than the current system. Open borders I am against though I am Pro legal immigration, I actually believe that a country&#39;s Health completely depends on it. Michelle Obama is a strong beautiful educated black woman. To call her and tranny ape is some of the most vile, racist, toxic bullshit that a normal healthy minded person could imagine. But then again, Trump Republicans are far from healthy and normal minded. They are literally the Idiocracy. Literally.</p>

<p>If you are pro legal immigration then why would you be on Bernies platform calling for open boarders. Freedom of movement. </p>

<p>I do not think you understand the problems of having 3rd worlders who can no speak English and have no clue about western values does to academia, although with Obongo, you got a little taste. Do you realize how low the bar has been set? Can you show me a Country where free higher education works great and does not have open borders?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think a lot of European and Scandinavian countries really want to attract young people and talented people into their countries plain and simple. I think the right makes too much out of it. There are problems, for instance I don&#39;t think Sharia enclaves should be allowed to form. I also think the left at the college level goes way too far with all their PC bullshit. I also think the left in general needs take it over there Illusions about Islam and realize that it is a very dangerous ideaology. While I see these as problems, I&#39;m not going to throw the baby out with the bathwater. Ultimately I think the lack of Universal Health Care is what will break this country and is probably the Maine reason I support Bernie. Now if you want to talk about immigration, talking about building a wall or creating a religious litmus test for who can enter the country even if they have a Visa is just ridiculous. If I thought Republicans were more serious about immigration and not just trying to Pander to a racist base I would take them a little more seriously.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is no need for immigration. The people coming through are not contributing anything. They are just leeching or providing corporations to pay lower wages. Universal healthcare has already broken much of Europe now that 3rd worlders are allowed to wander in. You really need to check sources. What you are describing is Sweden. Open borders free healthcare, welfare for all, free education. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You will never see European citizens demanding a repeal of universal health Care in favor of a free market system. That&#39;s because it works. They can&#39;t imagine going to an American style system. It sounds like a nightmare to them... Because it is! A lot of what you&#39;re saying here just sounds like some gloom and doom fear mongering you might read on Brietbart or Red State. Too much protectionism is just as bad as open borders. It&#39;s too reactionary.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. It does not work. What sounds like a nightmare to them are hordes of 3rd worlders with toxic ideologies manipulating the system and wasting their tax money.  Their health care system is now a failure long waits, people being turned away. You want free healthcare, ok, get rid of the welfare system and deport newcomers not contributing to the system. You sound like an insane person. </p>

<p>A lot of what I am saying here is accurate. When your Country has no go zones and it is illegal to raise the flag because it may trigger some Islamic zombie, that is a complete fail and cultural marxism at it finest. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is he a weak leader or has the media portrayed him to be weak?  The media has had nothing but negative stories about Trump since day one, the media in other countries are rebroadcasting the same stories, so it is likely other countries view us as week with this happening world wide.  Trump has been fighting this story for 7 months already, the media is influencing the group think of the nation to think this Russian story might be true when no evidence exists.  It is hard to get anything done when your own party which is swayed by public opinion as well turns against you because of poll numbers that are a direct result of the media bull shit in the first place </p>

    <div class="md"><p>7 months of continuous stories saying something Negative about anyone will inevitably lead to an overall negative opinion.  In this case we are talking about the president but it could be true about anyone.  The major news outlets other than Fox run solely negative stories on Trump, so since these companies have sister outlets in other countries we can assume their message is the same.  This leads to an overall world wide negative opinion on Trump with people  not really able to back up their opinion.  This is how public opinion is formed, and this is why our government hasn&#39;t been able to do anything it is an unfortunate situation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They aren&#39;t pushing us around because we know better otherwise we wouldn&#39;t be posting ideas to the conspiracy subs but the vast majority they are pushing people to think a certain way.  Like Obamacare being great after Gruber openly said people are too stupid to understand it so it was made vague on purpose </p>

<p>If a nation is united then it has more leverage In negotiations, but our government is anything but United, and the media will glorify all negative things world leaders say about our president.  The media is pushing the negative view because they want the world to be a more open place.  Less taxes and border tariffs makes it easier for the largest of companies to make money by outsourcing every piece of industry they can.  The TPP was a huge part of That and it is dead for now.  These deals only make the richest of the rich even more wealthier.  They consolidate control between themselves all under the guise that these deals help everyone involved when they never do.</p>

<p>Trump is trying to think of the American but with 7 months of negative stories the public opinion the media is creating has made it entirely impossible to do anything </p>

<p>I think what you are seeing is fear of the unknown and not vision of weakness. No one ever likes someone who is changing politics by trying to do what they said they would do. Most politicians these days talk but don&#39;t act. If I was Putin,Macron,Turnbul (fuck he is a piece of shit) even Merkel, I would be afraid. Because soon their populations will expect them to actually do what they say rather than just say it. I think Trump is the beginning of that, despite not agreeing with some of the things he plans on doing. Yes I do support him (im not american) but I feel that we are now going through a period of change in politics that will likely render the majority of career politicians void.</p>

Right blames Democrat obstruction. 
No one blames the system. 
When the bubble pops, only more divide et impera. </p>

<p>Hillary in office would have been too revelatory about the nature of the system, given her long experience close to the heart of the beast. That&#39;s why Trump had to win... he&#39;s the perfect fall-guy for what was long a coming. </p>

<p>in addition to all of this, governments are beginning to go straight to congress to negotiate things like trade deals like france did recently (i cant find the article on it right now).</p>

<p>France has not negotiated any trade deal with the US. Is that what Trump supporters actually believe? Then you are as ignorant as your POTUS who seriously believes that EU countries can negotiate individual trade deals. </p>

<p>Merkel had to explain to Trump SEVENTEEN TIMES that this isn&#39;t how it works. </p>

<p>Considering you&#39;re quoting OP and OP is clearly not a Trump supporter, I would say no, that is not what us &quot;ignorant&quot; Trump supporters believe.<br/>
But I do love being insulted by someone with the reading comprehension skills of a three year-old.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This reminds me of a video I watched about North Korean defectors first visit to US as compared to their impressions are of what it was like. They said watching the news in South Korea where they defected to they thought America was dangerous with shootings and violence happening all the time, but they were surprised upon visiting US how peaceful it was and how friendly the people were. It was nothing like it was portrayed in other countries. Just because something is portrayed one way in media doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s the truth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think a lot of European and Scandinavian countries really want to attract young people and talented people into their countries plain and simple. I think the right makes too much out of it. There are problems, for instance I don&#39;t think Sharia enclaves should be allowed to form. I also think the left at the college level goes way too far with all their PC bullshit. I also think the left in general needs take it over there Illusions about Islam and realize that it is a very dangerous ideaology. While I see these as problems, I&#39;m not going to throw the baby out with the bathwater. Ultimately I think the lack of Universal Health Care is what will break this country and is probably the Maine reason I support Bernie. Now if you want to talk about immigration, talking about building a wall or creating a religious litmus test for who can enter the country even if they have a Visa is just ridiculous. If I thought Republicans were more serious about immigration and not just trying to Pander to a racist base I would take them a little more seriously.</p>
