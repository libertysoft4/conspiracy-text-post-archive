        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><strong>This post discusses a topmindsofreddit mod previously working with a current conspiracy mod. It doesn&#39;t appear that this relationship still exists</strong></p>

<p>It&#39;s not much of a secret that brigading has become a problem in this sub. Crossposting in various subs helps contribute to this problem, yet for some reason the totesmessenger bot is banned from notifying us when something does get xposted. My first question is why this is the case when it could potentially help clean things up to a degree?</p>

<p>Next, we know that r/topmindsofreddit is one of the most prolific subs in crossposting from here, and their primary purpose is to mock conspiracy theorists. This alone is enough of a problem, but one of their mods admitted to working with a current mod here. They deleted the post, but I was able to archive it first: <a href="http://archive.is/uwKbn">http://archive.is/uwKbn</a></p>

<p>This seems suspicious, and I&#39;m wondering if that mod would be willing to come forward and explain the reason for this partnership.</p>

<p><strong>Edit to clarify:</strong> the archived link shows a discussion at r/conspiracyII, but the comment by the TMoR mod admits to working with a mod in this sub.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m only here to help out where I can. I&#39;ve worked with several former and one current r/conspiracy mod in the past so I don&#39;t see it as much of an issue. </p>

<p>OP, don&#39;t you think the past tense is a significant qualifier here, and that your title is therefore misleading? I don&#39;t know who the mod is incidentally, but there is no collaboration between this sub and TMOR.</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t know who the mod is, then you don&#39;t know if there&#39;s collaboration. Anyone on your mod team could be working with them. It would be much better to say &quot;I&#39;m not aware of anyone&quot; working with topminds.</p>

<p>Look, we discuss some pretty far out things here and we should not mind when skeptical people point out some of the stupid bullshit that gets posted here (looking at you flat earthers, looking at you directed with a big ol stink eye).</p>

<p>We have to be reasonable and accept the reality that not everything we discuss here is 100% accurate and true.  We have to understand that is impossible for everything we discuss her to be true because there are conflicting theories discussed here and they both cant be correct.</p>

<p>The way I see it, the truth has nothing to hide and is easily defended.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are correct and I agree with that.  But lets be honest. Most people do not know how to offer reasonable, skeptical counterpoints because there is no reward for it in this type of forum.  We get rewarded by making snarky, sarcastic remarks that belittle.

<p>Sure, they like to mock this sub - and they point to (or post under pseudonyms) some of the fringier topics discussed to belittle and mock this sub, but their motives are and always have been <strong>Entho-Political</strong>.</p>

<p>Conspiracy II was has not &quot;formed an alliance&quot; with TMOR, they were CREATED by the boys at TMOR, and there is clear evidence to demonstrate the truth of this statement.</p>

<p>This is not to say that ALL of the mods there were necessarily in on &quot;the game&quot;, I&#39;m quite certain that SOME of them were sincere. </p>

<p>Yeah, I&#39;ll get that to you. Some of it is in screen shots, some in archived posts, and I put together a nice timeline. Some came from a modmail conversation, and that is sacrosanct - so I&#39;ll have to make redactions if I share it at all.</p>

<p>Very busy for the moment. I&#39;ll try to get to it ASAP. Feel free to PM me later in case I space it - too much going on in real life at the moment.</p>

<p>The real issue is that <a href="/r/conspiracyII">/r/conspiracyII</a> really is collaborating with TopMinds. <a href="/u/Phoenix">/u/Phoenix</a> is deceiver, and his joining the modteam at TopMinds should be a wake-up call to any genuine conspiracy minded people who use <a href="/r/ConspiracyII">/r/ConspiracyII</a>. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am very suspicious on the numbers of my most recent post.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying that I expect to get 100s of up votes on everything I post, but it seemed to just stagnate making me suspect it was hidden </p>

<p>One of my pieces of evidence is that it received way more upvotes on <a href="/r/c_s_t">/r/c_s_t</a>. That has never happened no matter what I have posted. It&#39;s a simular crowd and they have way less numbers.</p>

<p>Anyway people might think it&#39;s lame to obsess about stuff like this but I feel there are posts that are messed with, hidden, or brigaded  (not just mine).</p>

<p>Also a big fuck you to the topmindsofreddit crowd. They are so worried about bigotry yet they have no problem harrassing and humiliating people. Disgusting.</p>

<p>And again I know there are many factors involved in what gets upvoted and what doesn&#39;t, but I have no doubt that something else is up.</p>

<p>What was suspicious about my last post was usually I at least get a handful of comments explaining why they down voted me or didn&#39;t like my post. Not that time because it wasn&#39;t even really seen.</p>

<p>I know, I don&#39;t like the linking here either but I can&#39;t find anything in the ToS that says what they&#39;re doing is illegal.  Besides, they&#39;re not the only sub that goofs at other subs and compiles drama.</p>

<p><strong>That is not what TopMinds is about. Never has been.</strong></p>

<p>Sure, they like to mock this sub - and they point to (or post under pseudonyms) some of the fringier topics discussed to belittle and mock this sub, but their motives are and always have been <strong>Entho-Political</strong>.</p>

<p>What am I talking about? Have a look at the TMOR Mods and see where ELSE they mod. Cross reference, and it will become clear soon enough.</p>

<p>Conspiracy II was has not &quot;formed an alliance&quot; with TMOR, they were CREATED by the boys at TMOR, and there is clear evidence to demonstrate the truth of this statement.</p>

<p>This is not to say that ALL of the mods there were necessarily in on &quot;the game&quot;, I&#39;m quite certain that SOME of them were sincere. </p>

<p>Anyway, the cat&#39;s out of the bag now, so we&#39;ll soon find out who is who, won&#39;t we?</p>

Ctrl+F &quot;in conspiracy&quot;</p>

<p>In 30 pages (about a days worth) there are 45 comments to r/conspiracy from the bot.</p>
