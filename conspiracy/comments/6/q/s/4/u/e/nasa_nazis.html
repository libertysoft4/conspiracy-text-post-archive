        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>There once was a program, right after the worlds bloodiest war, that decided to take the most evil men who took part in that war, and pardon them of all their crimes and make them free men.</p>

<p>That program was called Operation Paperclip.</p>

<p>The men were called the Nazis.</p>

<p>They were set loose, or rather hired as free men, in America.</p>

<p>These Nazis became the first employees of N.A.S.A!</p>

<p>There were also over 600 hired by the newly created C.I.A!</p>

<p>Funny, that these two organizations, which are under so much scrutiny these days, both hold Nazi origins.</p>

<p>So what were the Nazis famous for?</p>

<p>Manipulation? Lies? Disregard for morality and human life?</p>

<p>Huh....</p>

<p>Wanna know what the CIA with these &quot;fine&quot; &quot;outstanding&quot; men?</p>

<p>They let them create MIND CONTROL programs!</p>

<p>They showed utter disregard for human life... morality... and loved to manipulate...</p>

<p>Its almost as if the C.I.A. just let these Nazis be... well... Nazis!</p>

<p>And NASA, oh boy, did they lie and manipulate...</p>

<p>If you think we went to the moon, think again!</p>

<p>We went there how many times to do what...? </p>

<p>Deploy scientific experiments called &quot;ALSEPS&quot; which many failed, and their data is STILL... YES STILL... being deciphered?</p>

<p>Collect moon rocks?</p>

<p>Plant a flag?</p>

<p>Oh boy! What a waste of money!</p>

<p>But at least NASA got the glory of being the first... excuse me ONLY space agency to land a man on the moon.</p>

<p>In fact, recently NASA has admitted they LOST their ability to go back there.... we simply just do not have the technology anymore.</p>

<p>So I contend, and I have done thorough research on this matter, not only through the internet, but through (good God) PHYSICAL books, that the Earth is indeed - flat.</p>

<p>We are not a random collection of space dust.</p>

<p>We are not descendants of apes.</p>

<p>We are not accidents.</p>

<p>Those are the lies and manipulation of the Nazis.</p>

<p>These lies control your outlook and view of the world, and therefore your mind.</p>

<p>It is no accident that the space programs and mind control programs went hand in hand with the Nazis and all occurred at the same time in the past.</p>

<p>These lies are meant to further disconnect you to our Creator, our true way of life, and delve you into the hands of those who created the lies.</p>

<p>They own you.</p>

<p>They are your masters.</p>

<p>They control your mind, thoughts and actions.</p>

<p>It is time mankind rids ourselves of these manipulative monsters of madness.</p>

<p>Being aware of them and spreading the truth is the only weapon we have against them.</p>

<p>Sending a letter, voting, violence, rioting, none of those will change anything at the end of the day.</p>

<p>We must unite under the banner of righteousness and truth to purge our society of the satanic hold that cripples so many people of this Earth.</p>

<p>Earth is flat.</p>

<p>You can use sensitive gyroscopes to test the Earths spin, they make one rotation every 24 hours, just like the Earth. </p>

<p>I would be very curious for you to explain this parlor trick. </p>

<p>Just because you dont understand it doesnt make it a parlor trick. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Im willing to bet if you placed on in a vacuum chamber it would run substantially longer, the resistance against the air is the issue, and the loss of energy due to mechanics. </p>

<p>The point stands though you can build one yourself and it will function just like every other focault. </p>

<p>As I said, Foucaults pendulum proving Earths motion is just trickery, and an incorrect explanation of physics.</p>

<p>Earth is flat and motionless.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But...the curvature of the earth defines the visible distance across the surface of water.  Water isn&#39;t actually flat over a long distance.  You can tell this by calculating how far away the horizon is when you are in the middle of the ocean.  </p>

<p>For an observer who was theoretically standing on the surface of the water with height of 5 ft 7 in (average eye-level height), the horizon is at a distance of 2.9 mi.  You can&#39;t see further than that because the earth curves and the water level actually dips underneath what you can see and it is obscured by the other water.  </p>

<p>For someone standing a little bit higher, say on a 3-4 passenger boat, eye level would be around 6 ft 7 in, the horizon is at a distance of 3.1 mi.  The reason for this is that you are starting higher up, so you can see further before the curvature of the earth takes the water out of your field of view.  </p>

<p>For an observer standing on a cruise ship tower or something like a oil drilling platform with a height of 330 ft, the horizon doesn&#39;t fall out of view until 22 mi away.  </p>

<p>The formula to calculate this (in standard units not metric) is 
SquareRoot(height above surface / 0.5736) = distance to horizon</p>

<p>So for someone whose eyes are at 5.5 feet tall the calculation would be  SquareRoot(5.5 / 0.5736) = 3 miles.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah thats a load of bull.</p>

<p>I am an an observer, and in reality, not theoretically, I have stood at the waters edge, and seen much farther than 2.9 miles. No, the object I saw was not far above the water either, it itself was at the waters edge. It was an island, and it was not a mirage, as the usual explanation is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What island?  For argument&#39;s sake, let&#39;s look at the elevation of the specific island you&#39;re referencing over sea level and we can calculate from just how far away that specific island would be visible. </p>

<p>If the island is over sea level, even a few feet, then the portion that is over sea level will be visible past 2.9 miles.  Anything that is at sea level would fall out of your line of vision at 2.9 miles.  </p>

<p>This is why the further away from an island you are the smaller it looks width wise as well.  You are only seeing the top of the upside down ice cream cone shape that is the island, the closer you get to the island the more of the base you see...so it appears wider.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not theorizing, I&#39;m saying that mathematically you can calculate how much of an island you can see.  It&#39;s actually pretty neat.  Math is the universal language...it doesn&#39;t care what you &quot;believe&quot; it is simply correct or incorrect.  In this case the formula to determine maximum distance that is viewable across a plane (as determined by a straight line between 2 points) over a rounded object is infinitely repeatable, and it can be calculated using different sized sounded objects (so the earth would have a different curvature and viewable plane than the moon).  </p>

<p>A rainbow is interesting. Why isn&#39;t it straight?</p>

<p>Know what else is interesting? Wether Flat or round, certain ideas work for both. But the flat horizon never works for round.</p>

<p>This is hilarious because this really goes to show people that FEers are intellectually lazy. You could have put 5 minutes worth of your time into finding this out but you didnt because you would rather jump to conclusions with zero evidence. </p>

<p>Everyone knows rainbows are Gods tears crying because people believe the Earth is flat. </p>

<p>The curvature is too slight to notice left to right but you sure as shit can see curvature as something moves away from you and goes over the horizon. </p>

<p>If we boiled down everything to the logic you used here that means that democracy is for pedophiles, religion is a money making scam and/or run by pedophiles, Australia is entirely a convict prison and nothing else, The Queen of England is illegitimate and is in fact Queen of Germany  and vegans want to commit genocide.</p>

<p>Because those Nazis part of project paperclip got medals for performing human experimentation and killing hundreds of thousands of innocent people and a free ride to tax paid retirement, all under the secret plans of the government.</p>

<p>They executed Operation Paperclip without a single democratic action.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>1,600 people we&#39;re part of Operation Paperclip, from the areas of Aeronautics, Rocketry, Architecture, electronics, Material Science, Physics and, yes, medical science. And yes, that probably means that some of those medical science people did preform human studies. And yeah, its a shitty moral and ethical grey area there. But to say, that NASA is all lies and manipulation based on the actions of a small percentage of its creation. Well, let me put it to you in terms you understand.</p>

<p>You are a christian, judging by your posts. Which means you are, to use your logic, a murderer at best. Why, because during the crusades the Church allowed hundreds and thousands to pillage in the name of god without punishment from law and to be absolved in the eyes of god. At worst, you are a paedophile, as those of the church, most recently Cardinal George Pell of Australia have been charged, or at least heavily implicated in paedophilia and covering such acts up.</p>

<p>Is it insane to call you a murderer and a paedopile? Yes, yes it is. You are simply a misguided man and neither of these things. But, that&#39;s what your own damn logic says you are, because the actions of a few.</p>

<p>TLDR: The actions of the whole do not condemn the few, and the few do not absolve the whole</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You sir, are a imbecile.</p>

<p>Do not detract from the fact that NASA employed war criminals and the government set these men free without consent of a the people they serve.</p>

<p>I cannot even fathom how you think you can even attempt a correlation between the belief in God and labeling someone a murderer and pedophile. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cardinal George Pell, a man of god, is currently being charged for sexual assault. He is a suspected paedophile. He used is position as a mouthpiece of God to destroy peoples lives. There&#39;s your correlation. </p>

<p>Now, if I was to use your logic, I would use his actions to damn every christian, catholic, rabbi and Imam. But, I know that the actions of one, do not damn the entire block. Because that&#39;s not how it works.</p>

<p>A lot of the Nazi party were just men, following orders under pain of death. Yes, there were just as many who were utter scumbags and committed war crimes. But there is a difference between Nazi Party Member, and Nazi Party Sympathiser.</p>
