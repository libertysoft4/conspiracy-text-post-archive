<p>The amount of people on this sub who genuinely argue with each other over the prettiest of shit and resort to name calling of &quot;left winger!&quot; and &quot;right winger!&quot; Is absurd! For christs sake people, at the end of the day the only difference between a corrupt republican and a corrupt democrat is in name. </p>

<p>The real enemy is not another user browsing this sub forum, it is people like the Koch brothers, Soros, the Guptja family (South Africa), and the Rothschilds. If you are not willing to look at a conspiracy because of a certain party, there&#39;s a good chance you&#39;re being biased.</p>

<p>(I&#39;m a bad writer, I know. But seeing the infighting between good people is upsetting.)</p>

<p>Typical of a socialist to have no idea about specialisation or skill development; typical reaction of a person who&#39;s done very little if anything at all to better themselves and produce anything of worth in their meaningless and short existence.</p>

<p>Do you have any idea how much of what you consume is based on hard work, individual determination and motivation, artistic vision and creativity, and self-sacrifice on a level you&#39;d be unwilling to make in this society or a socialist one? If you were aware of any of that it would make your head spin, but the truth is you&#39;re a born consumer and nothing more.</p>

<p>Here are some questions :</p>

<p>How is, &quot;if everything suddenly disappeared you wouldn&#39;t be able to make money or survive!&quot; An argument against capitalism?</p>

<p>Do you have any idea how much IP you consume on a daily basis? Do you have any idea the level of skill involved in the creation of the IP you consume? Are you aware of the personal sacrifice involved by the people who create the IP? Are you aware of how you&#39;ve contributed literally nothing to their life that haven&#39;t contributed to yours, while still consuming their IP and producing none of your own?</p>

<p>Are you prepared to live in a world where all your mediums of interest and entertainment have either stagnated into state propaganda or disappear altogether due to more and more people thinking like yourself?</p>

<p>Your top comment of all time is about a movie. You have no clue how much of a disparity there is in terms of skill and motivation spread among those involved in the creation of film.</p>

<p>Your top post of all time is about a movie. You play PlayStation and watch documentaries.</p>

<p>Hope you like state-sponsored video games and documentaries.</p>

<p>Well now we know you are a liar or you don&#39;t know how to do basic research for the claims you make. My highest comment was about a dog being woken up by an asshole cat and then goes back to sleep after it sees its human.  </p>

<p>Your post is some enormous ad hominem motivated by your egomania and narcissism. I am very much pro capitalism, it is awesome in how it finances innovation through competition which allows unparalleled resources to be used for such causes. Through this innovation we advance humanity and improve the overall quality of life. The competition for profit causes a race to the bottom for many goods that makes them accessible to the poor and large populations. Those are just two of the many awesome pros of capitalism that make it superior to any economic system ever devised. </p>

<p>Before you went on some egomaniacal rant(which was quite embarrassing, full of ridiculous assumptions, and was motivated by your egomania and narcissism) I was referring to the amount of government resources you consume. You want to be and actually are a free loader obviously. You want to use all these government resources to make your wealth for free. The more government resources you use to acquire wealth, the more you should pay in taxes.  Stop being a parasite and wanting something for nothing.  </p>

<p>I already answered this... You appear to not be following the conversation. I will copy and paste the answer to your question. There are countless government resources that you owe your existence to, do you have workers, do you have customers, what economic conditions produce the rules of your industry, who educated your workers(probably public schools), patent laws, etc.</p>

<p>that of an ungrateful person trying to get something for nothing. You are not acknowledging all the government resources you are using to make your wealth. Yes you should be taxed. Yes if you are super wealthy, you should be taxed more than the average joe. The super wealthy are using more government resources than the average joe. </p>

<p>Then what exactly is wrong? I pay taxes, I believe in a functioning government and free market economy. I&#39;m well aware of what a functional capitalist society enables is citizens to do, and I&#39;m aware that the taxes generated from its citizens enable us to have infrastructure. I&#39;m all for it, which is why I work hard, don&#39;t expect anything for nothing, and pay taxes.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe in socialism or communism, which is what the original post I was responding to was defending. Maybe you should learn to read.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That now I owe my returns to people whom I&#39;ve already paid or bartered for what they created?</p>

<p>This statement of mine is saying nothing about the government.</p>

<p>Go read the parents again. My initial comment was:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You did nothing to help me achieve or create, so why should I hand you the returns</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I wasn&#39;t talking about not paying taxes, dumbass. I wasn&#39;t talking about not using public infrastructure. I was talking directly to the guy arguing in favor of socialism. You want freeloaders? It&#39;s the people who want the government to pay them dividends from work I did. </p>

<p>Seriously, man... you should email aronofsky and tell him that he ought to be in favor of socialism since he uses roads and electrical power. That&#39;s how your entire argument is coming across due to how inarticulate you are.</p>

<p>If you are incapable of such a thing, consider what it would take for you to actually do it. If someone held your kids in prison until you produced the film, how old would they be when you finally saw them again? Couple days in your mind, I&#39;m sure.</p>

<p>We will give your film away for free and your compensation will be knowing how much youve contributed to humanity, sound fair?</p>

<p>Hope your film serves the ideological agenda of the state, comrade, or it&#39;s off to the gulag with you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s not true. Take any group of people and you will find legislation and interest groups that threaten their core values. My point is that this is the scam. Whatever you believe in, I&#39;m sure it is under threat from someone. The result is that at election time you basically have to vote for the one candidate who cares about the thing most important to you.</p>

<p>You care about tradition and values. There&#39;s a party for that. Someone else cares about the environment. There&#39;s a party for that. Someone else wants the flag to have a rainbow dildo on it. There&#39;s a party for that.</p>

<p>But almost none of the things these politicians run on get changed. They blame gridlock. But they have no problem passing military appropriations and giving money to big industries. But there is no party for that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not just Syrians or the recent migrants. It&#39;s been happening in Europe for decades. London is already majority non-British. Soon the entire of Britain will be majority non-British. I&#39;m not British, but I think it&#39;s a shame that a few hundred years from now most people living in Great Britain will be non-British ethnically. It&#39;s no different than if Japan became majority non-Japanese, or Nigeria became majority non-Nigerian. </p>

<p>Every ethnic group has a right to exist without being wiped out or mixed beyond recognition. It&#39;s not racist for British or French or Germans or Swedes to want to preserve their ethnicity like every other group. For some reason, other groups are allowed and encouraged to be proud of their identity and want to preserve it, but whites are not. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, we&#39;re all aware of the complex genetics of Europeans. They all have some amount of Neanderthal, some amount of indigenous European, and some amount of Indo-European blood, with various conquests in different countries creating different blends. British people aren&#39;t &quot;pure&quot;, but they are most definitely an ethnicity just like any other in the world. And more broadly, Europeans are a distinct ethnic group that is quite different than Sub-Saharan Africans, for example.</p>

<p>I assume you think all of the world&#39;s people should eventually blend together to form one mono-ethnicity. I think that&#39;s sad, and would kill the great diversity of the world&#39;s populations. And I don&#39;t know why only Europeans are being asked to breed themselves out of existence right now. </p>

<p>That&#39;s a gross over-exaggeration; there is a huge difference in forced blending of all people and lowering restrictions on immigration (which there are many benefits to). </p>

<blockquote>
<p>And I don&#39;t know why only Europeans are being asked to breed themselves out of existence right now.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Believe it or not, you are both wrong and right (but still racist). They are not &quot;breeding themselves out of existence&quot; but European birth rates are dropping (which is unrelated to immigration). In this case, immigration is a GOOD THING because the new populace is making up for rich(er) Europeans who due to their social status. Same thing is happening in Japan, and their economy is suffering because their harsh anti-immigration stances are preventing young people to come in and help out the aging native population.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Europe has stable birthrates, around 2 per woman. France, for example, is at 2.07, which is precisely the replacement rate, which is much better than many parts of Africa which have unchecked population growth which has increased their poverty. Why would France want to bring in immigrants when it has high unemployment and a stable birthrate? The idea that Europe needs immigrants is a myth. Even if the population decreases slightly in some places, that&#39;s better than over-population, and with automation there is actually a surplus of labor in Europe right now, which will only get worse. </p>

<p>Eventually, with increased immigration the European ethnicity will cease to exist. That&#39;s inevitable with the rates of immigration that are happening. Again, you don&#39;t seem to care. I do.</p>

<p>there ABSOLUTELY are genes that result in everything, including increased athleticism or intelligence. Black people have more fast twitch muscles, it&#39;s why they can jump higher and run faster (generally speaking). This is science. They were born with advantages that asians whites and others do not have. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not familiar with what specific trait provides East Asians such as Koreans Japanese and Chinese with higher brain processing power, butnit absolutely exists. People are not the same. Evolution is real. Genetic coding is real. And our genetics are different depending on where you and your ancestors are from. These are facts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol!  It&#39;s important to understand, the reason there IS such a thing as black people. In reality there shouldn&#39;t be. Africa is a huge continent, sub-saharan Africa alone is bigger the continual Europe. </p>

<p>So it should be, Urubus, and Wambesis, Bantus and Zulus... etc. However since the  ethnicity of the African American people were taken from them during slavery, and they were mixed for breeding purposes, they largely don&#39;t know where they are from, or have no connection to that heritage. </p>

<p>Therefore they created the ethnicity of Black, to cover themselves for lack of any other ethnicity. </p>

<p>That doesn&#39;t suddenly make all Europeans &quot;white&quot;. The Nazis believed you could biologically divide humanity into 3 races, the negroid, the mongoloid and the Arian, with further divisions inside the categories.<br/>
Of course it was utter hogwash, with no biological consideration at all. </p>

<p>And they desperately tried to move the Jews out, claiming either they were some kind of negroid, or a type of nomadic Oriental. (not a joke)</p>

<p>So while you can certainly describe a person as &quot;white&quot; if he/she has low melatonin, descriptions can be simple, it has no bearing on reality at all. </p>

While I don&#39;t have a strong option on the issue myself, wouldn&#39;t it be fair to say that even if mass immigration was being (as you say) FORCED upon &quot;white nations&quot; that if wealth were distributed more equally within the country that crime/ideological tensions wouldn&#39;t be as high as they are now?</p>

<p>From my experience, tensions only arise between races and/or ethnicities when there is a mass wealth divide which creates a sense of arrogance on the side which had wealth, a sense of helplessness, frustration, and anger on the side which does not, and a strong cognitive disconnect amongst them both.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Finite at any given time. Food and water is renewable though over time. Food grows and water flows. The only reason our resources are stretched thin in the West is due to apolitical psychopaths in political power who don&#39;t care for bettering the country or world, but rather for personal gain at the expense of those who their banker overlords want to bomb at the time, so they siphon off as much money from the circulation as possible for the war machine and keep as bare little as they can available for us to spread thin in use growing our own food and bettering our education and schooling.<br/>
From a physical resource standpoint, I was lucky to be born in &quot;the west&quot;. I&#39;ve learned that I clearly don&#39;t need a much as they try to convince us we need through our consumerist culture. Therefore I&#39;m completely fine in sharing those resources with other human beings who need them because <em>I have enough</em>. We&#39;re not sharing these things with the whole world. Only the relatively small percentage who are coming to the west for refuge because their own countries are being destroyed by our militaries. If you&#39;re not willing to help the person whose family your tax money went to help kill then you&#39;re not a very compassionate person.<br/>
Some people who&#39;ve lived their lives somewhat isolated from Western socially liberal culture may not understand or respect it at first, so I can see your concern, but if you put in the time and effort to understand and respect another humans culture then they are more likely to do the same for you. You can&#39;t change a whole group of people, but if you put in the time to learn then you can change people one by one. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I read about the laws and customs of other countries and cultures. I enjoy traveling so i make it a point to learn their basic rules before going wherever i am headed to next.</p>

<p>Many places are not so kind to what we consider to be normal and acceptable behavior. </p>

<p>Do you know what honor killings are? Do you know how many festivals in europe have been canceled because of sexual assault spikes? do you realize that women walking down the street in a mini skirt and a tank top are &quot;asking to be raped&quot; in the eyes of many? Do you know what the law says to do to women, homosexuals, basically any person who is not a Muslim man with a beard under sharia law? Do you watch the news showing the &quot;peaceful protests&quot; in europe with hundreds of middle easterners waving ISIS flags and claiming the Islam will conquer the world? </p>

<p>it really blows my mind that others can witness the same world that i do and come out of it with the conclusion &quot;huh, these people are just like me and are as nice as my friends and family. cultures are equal, morally and ethically across the world, please come bless me with your diversity.&quot;</p>

<p>Fuck all that. I am an actual progressive in that i care about the rights and safety of my friends and of those not in power. If you ask me to ship a bunch of backwards barbarians from halfway across the world who want to kill them for having the gall to fuck who they like to fuck or wear what they want to wear, I forever and always will tell you to pound sand kick rocks and fuck off.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My cousin that grew up in hong kong and later went to school in Norway was harassed for wearing a skirt while vacationing somewhere through Europe two years ago. She told me about her experiences that Christmas but you don&#39;t actually give a shit. </p>

<p>and because as we all know, things don&#39;t happen unless they happen to you or someone you immediately know. just disregard everything i posted in my previous comment and everything that comes with importing millions of people who hate core progressive values entirely.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve never seen a hippo in person. That doesn&#39;t mean if i did that i&#39;d run up to it and try to climb on it&#39;s back like a horse. Because i know what hippos do, because humans are able to spread information to each other through means besides personal testimony. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you&#39;re basically saying that you have zero experience and you&#39;re basing it because your cousin said someone in Europe bothered her? </p>

<p>Therefore, an entire race and religious group are scum that deserve to be killed. Amazing. </p>

<p>First of all, Indonesia is the world&#39;s largest Muslim majority country. Indonesians are the largest (or second largest) minority group in HK. Your cousin would&#39;ve interacted with Muslims far more regularly and on a much larger scale in HK than anywhere in Europe. </p>

<p>Secondly, <em>I&#39;ve actually lived</em> in a Muslim country. And guess what? They&#39;re normal people. They&#39;re not mindless &#39;savages.&#39; They&#39;re normal people that just want to get by. Some have progressive views (for example, American Muslims overwhelmingly vote for secular and progressive parties - Bernie Sanders won their vote - and are more supportive of gay marriage than American Protestants), and others have conservative views. </p>

<p>You&#39;ve probably never interacted with a Middle Eastern or Muslim person. That&#39;s why you&#39;ve got such extremist views. You&#39;ve managed to dehumanize them through stewing on hate forums to the point where they&#39;re just &#39;mindless savages&#39; to you. </p>

<p>My advice is to actually <em>interact</em> with one rather than just listening to what ihatesandniggers66 on the_donald tells you. </p>

<p>Trump flew to Saudi Arabia, danced for the king, basically sucked their dicks, and sold them weapons.</p>

<p>He also excluded them from his ban.</p>

<p>But yeah, keep whining about Hillary. </p>

<p>Islam prohibits any form of premarital sex or gender mixing. No practicing Muslim would go to a festival. </p>

<p>Do you know that none of the countries that these immigrants come from practice sharia law? Algeria, Tunisia, Syria, etc. are all secular states. </p>

<p>No, the only country that practices real sharia law is Trump&#39;s bffs Saudi Arabia. But hey, I&#39;m sure you don&#39;t mind it when Trump flies to Saudi Arabia to suck their king&#39;s dick. </p>

<p>That&#39;s because we&#39;ve actually <em>traveled</em> and interacted with Middle Easterners and Muslims and don&#39;t gain our knowledge of them exclusively from the_donald. We know that they&#39;re <em>actual humans</em> and not just mindless drones who think of nothing but the sharia law boogeyman. </p>

<p>If someone was to base their view of Trump supporters on what they read online from biased sources, they&#39;d think you&#39;re a bunch of genocidal inbred pigfuckers who want all non-whites killed or deported. Yet I&#39;m sure you&#39;d despite that claim.</p>

<p>Suuure you do. Let&#39;s be real here. You don&#39;t give a shit about women, gays, or rights unless it involves Muslims. If a conservative Christian tried to implement religious law, outlaw booze or whatever, you&#39;d ignore it. Hell, if they were a Trump supporter, you&#39;d probably praise it. </p>

<p>Uh. You do realize that the overwhelming majority of Muslim majority nations have legal systems based off of either French civil law or English common law, right?

<p>Umm if you are in the west sure that&#39;s how most religious courts work in western countries. I&#39;m in Malaysia considered a moderate country, and this is not really true at all, religious law have more jurisdiction and can overule state law at times.</p>

<p>Stop bombing people&#39;s homelands is a legitimate answer to the original post, but isn&#39;t that the conspiracy in the first place?</p>

<p>It&#39;s also true that influencing a nation&#39;s people to believe nationalist (cultural, ethnic) sentiment is a bad thing is pretty fucked up, and wrecked by &quot;leftist&quot; or &quot;globalist,&quot; if either term applies, propoganda as well.</p>

<p>We could all get along, yes. But the way they make us see it and the way the events are orchestrated are intended to create division. The root of the problem.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The contemporary Right in the United States is usually understood as a category that includes social conservatives, Christian conservatives, free market liberals, and economic libertarians who are often identified with the Republican Party. In general, the term right-wing is understood to imply a commitment to conservative Christian values, support for a free-market economic system, support for a strong national defense, and support for traditional family values. The contemporary center-right usually defines itself as promoting deregulation of banking, commerce, and industry.[51]</p>

<p>I just refuted your counter argument kid. You have nothing to say in defense of your argument. I think you and others are confusing my use of the word &#39;government&#39; to mean &quot;a government&quot;. Obviously people can be against their current government and not be right wing(if that is how you interpreted my original comment). I am discussing people&#39;s ideal role for government in the affairs of their lives and the economy. Right wing means you want smaller/less government involvement and fewer regulations. Around the entire world this is true. Left wing and right wing are not complete false social constructs(even though the specific differences between left and right vary per country), they refer to very specific concepts that are very real. It is important to know what they refer to. In the context of this conversation, this subreddit is obviously very right wing. </p>

<p>you constantly state that being right wing means you don&#39;t want any form of government, yet now you&#39;re trying to play it off as though you were just saying they want smaller government, nobody is fooled by this. you clearly don&#39;t know what the fuck you&#39;re talking about... especially since you&#39;re calling the <em>CONSPIRACY</em> subreddit right wing.</p>

<p>That makes no sense. The &quot;government is the devil&quot; and trying to kill your kids sentiment is always the comment or post voted up to the top meaning that is the majority position. That means right wing is the majority position. If you think Asktrumpsupporters is evenly split your reality barometer is a bit off. Fringe alt right is the main demographic for that sub. Trump&#39;s policies are far right, any of the &quot;leftists&quot; who support him aren&#39;t leftists by definition no matter what they think of themselves. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I completely agree. This depressing reality is something I would like to change. How do we do it without a full scale revolution? Will the federal reserve and wall street continue the cycle of bursting financial bubbles and creating wars until the end of time? </p>

<p>When there&#39;s such a huge amount of money and politics involved, how can one or ten or even a hundred thousand people make a difference? I wish I knew the answer. I hate the power of money. </p>

<p>Why can&#39;t big interests just be good people? We have multiple billionaires sitting on their asses, NOT creating worldwide food distribution methods, NOT creating massive clean energy farms, NOT caring if CO2 emissions literally destroy the earth as we know it. </p>

<p>I&#39;m starting to believe the world of mad max is our future. Unless the rich and powerful suddenly decide to work together in a meaningful, large scale, productive manner, I fear that billions will eventually die, simply from poverty. Automation <em>will drastically</em> increase the unemployment rate, and that increase in revenue and productivity needs to go somewhere. God forbid it goes back to the people, the people who helped create this world by living in it and contributing to it. </p>

<p>No, let&#39;s just keep fighting pointless wars in the interest of oil and weapon sales, all under the guise of patriotism and &quot;homeland security.&quot; If you didn&#39;t know, 9/11 was a false flag operation that involved many, many parties. I could go into this, but if you&#39;re reading this on this sub then you probably know more than I do. </p>

<p>Our rights and our privacy are being stripped at an alarming rate. I don&#39;t feel safe <em>at all</em> around law enforcement. If you go against the grain, even legally, you will get fucked. If you look slightly out of place, you get profiled and treated like a criminal. </p>

<p>America isn&#39;t free, and we haven&#39;t been for a long time. That income tax you pay? Unconstitutional. There is no law that requires you to pay income tax, or file a tax return. It&#39;s a scam, and the tax itself ONLY PAYS FOR THE INTEREST ON THE LOANS THAT WERE LENDED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE IN THE FIRST PLACE. It&#39;s a fucking scam, and hundreds of millions pay into it year after year. It is impossible to pay it all back. It&#39;s a machine that perpetually runs itself because we keep feeding it. </p>

<p>But, fuck us for wanting societal equality. Pull up your bootstraps kiddos, we&#39;re in this for the long haul. </p>

People still knew a lot was bullshit but if you only get told A by every source, then A has to be the truth, right?
Now we see what people without industry agendas think, the man-in-the-street for the first time has a voice that can actually be heard- not quoted or impressioned.
However, now we have the US attempting to stifle Net Neutrality, Putin outlawing VPN in Russia from November and the UK recently introduced the most intrusive data laws in global history- so bad even China is copying them almost verbiage to include them in Chinese law.
Still much to do, I think!</p>

<p>Anyone with eyes open can see that both parties are part of the same control mechanism and neither is for the people.

    <div class="md"><p>that&#39;s got more to do with the Republican party being rebranded as the de-facto christian religion party.  </p>

<p>what&#39;s scariest to me in this country is the mass grassroots support for religious law governing this country.  Christian Sharia law if you will.   </p>

<p>the abortion issue is interesting because it&#39;s two separate arguments.  one side is saying &quot;let these women choose&quot;  </p>

<p>the other side is saying &quot;this is literal murder&quot;  </p>

<p>one is arguing that a woman should choose for herself what she does with her embryo, the other is saying that it is murder.  </p>

<p>which is right?   i&#39;m not here to argue that.  </p>

<p>The democratic party has aligned itself with the &quot;choice&quot; and the republican party has aligned itself with &quot;murder&quot;</p>

<p>so sure, what does foreign policy and tax rates have to do with abortion?  nothing.  </p>

<p>so in the eyes of that type of voter it mostly goes like this.</p>

<p>there&#39;s two choices in most election and one side sides with my faith in that YES THIS IS MURDER.  </p>

<p>well murder is the highest crime in the bible, so while yes, it doesn&#39;t mean shit for foreign policy, tax rates, environment, grabbing a woman by the pussy.   it&#39;s still murder and the other side is okay with murder and the republican party is not okay with murder.  </p>

<p>so it doesn&#39;t matter that said party is fucking you every other which way, they are &quot;people of faith&quot; because they don&#39;t want these murders to continue.  so you vote for them even if it is economically against your own best interests.  because you are a person of faith, you fear god, you believe in god and your time on this planet is short and you want your best shot into heaven.  </p>

<p>so you don&#39;t give a shit about all other things, because people are murdering babies and this candidate says that murder is wrong.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>On the other hand, literally bloody controlled false &quot;revolutions&quot; are the result of violence.
I&#39;m not saying to let the elite step all over us, (you have to fight back if they&#39;re going to pull the trigger on you)
but violence is a trap in my opinion.
Don&#39;t be the first to raise your fists or gun.
Last resort for freedom.</p>

<p>Many revolutions have been compromized.
Protests compromized and turned violent, 
thus character assassination for those involved
&quot;see it&#39;s those violent youths!&quot; and other crap.
As well as people getting hurt of course. :/
To go on a &quot;let&#39;s hang the bankers&quot; killing spree would be immoral,
overkill, unjust and let&#39;s not forget the Dark Knight scene where
Joker&#39;s goons made innocent people look like murderer clowns.
&quot;Hey let&#39;s snipe them all, they&#39;re sitting ducks!....No! They&#39;re civilians, look at their hands taped with a pistol!&quot;</p>

<p>An (elite level) banker would kill dozens of low/mid level and fairly innocent people
before any &quot;for the people&quot; swat teams get to them.
It&#39;s seriously a bad move because it&#39;s difficult to pull off without getting innocent people killed.
We have to reform the government and justice system.
Destroy the two party system. Make those in washington powerless as they
see the people awake and not willing to comply, the system stops to a halt which doesn&#39;t really serve the slavery obsessed elite bankers.</p>

<p>The absolute absolute best route is to wake up 300 million people in America
(non-Americans can also do the same with their respective countries)
with the truth.
We the people will demand an independent and ending of the FED
and debt based banking system.
Violent revolution has often diverted back to oligarch control
because who&#39;s best at playing dirty and causing a bloody mess?
Psychopaths.
Well that&#39;s just my simplistic view of things anyway.
Violence should be an absolute last resort.
Make the people see what a corrupt government the colluding dem/repub system
is. The fake news meme dented the corporate media,
the anti-Bernie lies from the media made a massive dent,
pro-hillary lies, another massive dent (Bernie and Trump fans mostly hate Clinton).</p>

<p>There are still lots of nooby normies who think
Democrats are good and repubs are corrupt when they&#39;re both corrupt almost entirely,
so we just have to drop this normalcy of
&quot;the govmint will protect me, but screw u homophobic repubs!&quot;
These half red pilled people need to wake up.
The idiots will take the longest to come round
but the smarter sleeping people will wake up with enough evidence,
then they&#39;ll talk with their friend circles and the truth spreads.
Corporate media is on a fast road to hell (dying),
and people are losing faith in Trump and already millions lost faith
in Democrats, therefore it would be unwise to start going into
this fight guns blazing. We are sort of, starting to win.
We just have to put our win on steroids.
Campaigning with well thought out memes,
YouTube videos, anything that shows
&quot;NO, conspiracy theories are not all crazy WAKE UP see evidence inside&quot;
type stuff or &quot;see I told you Trump/repubs and Clinton/democrats were corrupt from
at least 30 years ago, we have to take them down&quot;.</p>

<p>My suggestion is a centrist (just slightly to the right of Bernie) independent 
with lots of security and coverage, a competing channel against corporate media,
online channels that cannot be compromized, anonymous presenters,
documentaries telling the truth about the establishment without overly dramatic music,
online campaigns on social media, etc.</p>

<p>Even without that prep,
the biggest hurdle to freedom is finding a way
to wake up the people.
If even 3/4ths of voting Americans knew about the two party scam
and were sick of it, (and increased the number of people voting, as the % is disappointingly low)
we could seriously crush the deceptive narrative of &quot;you must vote either dem or repub&quot;.</p>

<p>Just my opinion but I think it&#39;s the best course of action.
EDIT: also, another way to reduce bloodshed,
is to expose the fact elites sometimes bankroll violence in protests,
thus changing peoples&#39; attitudes naturally.
And of course, the more police and military that know
the truth about the establishment, the less likely
they&#39;d attack an innocent citizen.
Brainwashed police/military is a serious danger hence
we need to redpill as much as possible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you, reasonable voice.
I&#39;m center left and only slightly left libertarian (but sympathize with anarchists, etc.)
so would prefer to see a center left independent like Jill Stein (assuming she&#39;s not controlled)
but I would settle for centrist if it would make people
meet me half way and start waking people up
that right wing politicians have always failed the people because it serves the establishment (even conservativism is anti-worker, let alone NEOconservatives)
especially as they both tend to be extremely authoritarian.</p>

<p>I absolutely agree with you,
everyone who isn&#39;t an insane authoritarian ass kisser can come on board.
Moderate libertarians I can tolerate fine, but the extreme type
like Gary Johnson, Ron/Rand Paul, Laissez-faire bullshit, extreme right wing etc.
isn&#39;t compatible because these people haven&#39;t explored enought
to know it&#39;s a trap, a &quot;liberty for the corps&quot; type trap.</p>

<p>I know the political spectrum isn&#39;t a water right concept
and sometimes inaccuracies pop up,
as well as the U.S. being right wing-shifted (what&#39;s centrist in the U.S. is center left in Europe
so we in the U.S. obviously fkd up big time lol)
but as rough understanding, this seems like a reasonable alliance maybe:
<a href="http://imgur.com/a/Ibp9S">http://imgur.com/a/Ibp9S</a></p>

<p>Basically, anyone who doesn&#39;t want workers to be screwed over.
I know it&#39;s a very simplified view, but the image
sort of omits the most dangerous of maniacs and brainwashed people
at least, which would make it a lot easier to agree on a centrist candidate.
(Centrist in the U.S. is center right in Europe....but damn we have 
to start somewhere!!! lol)</p>

I&#39;ve been working on a fairly long visual presentation to show my political points in a simple

I feel like I have to compile many angles to get people to drop their ideological mindset.
It already takes 20-30 mins to watch the presentation comfortably, adding more would be ridiculous.

    <div class="md"><p>Wage workers have control over their hours and conditions. They can opt not to work somewhere that doesn&#39;t meet their criteria. It would be like saying &quot;women have no control in marriage, they have to be in abusive relationships&quot;, no, they don&#39;t have to marry an abuser, they can just find a better guy.</p>

<p>As an anarchist, I agree that its wrong for the government to make illegal those traditional methods of acquiring property (squatting and homesteading).</p>

<p>If I say &quot;eating this food is voluntary&quot; and you say, no it&#39;s not because the alternative is dying, ok, we&#39;re not having much of a debate. My employee can work for me, work for someone else, convince someone to provide for her, or get charity. You can eat this food or that food or that food, it&#39;s voluntary. Yes, you need calories and resources to live, but that&#39;s a problem inherent to life, we can&#39;t make it go away. The most efficient and moral way to get those resources is freedom to trade. </p>

<p>Relying on others is a fine way to require resources, by the way, its what females of most species have to do during childbirth/rearing.  And children and the elderly of course, they rely on others, no problem there. Plenty of people take vows of poverty, that&#39;s an option too. Or you can work for what you want. Seems like every option is on the table. If that&#39;s not voluntary, I dont know what is.</p>

<p>I do know that a world in which I&#39;m not allowed to engage in free trade, which it sounds like your espousing, would necessitate using force against me, which would not be voluntary. Whereas in my ideal world, defined by anarcho-capitalism, you&#39;re more than welcome to practice what you like. You and your friends can start a commune and not use money in Ancapistan. Anarchism and capitalism are the systems defined by voluntary exchanges. Other political and economic systems rely on force.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What do you take me for?  I&#39;m an anarchist, too.  Specifically, a mutualist.</p>

<p><strong>Capitalism is not anarchistic, nor is it voluntary.</strong></p>

<p>As I said before, capitalism is based upon rents on <em>capital,</em> such as machines or land.  The only way to ensure that these rents end up paid is through force and coercion, such as a state.</p>

<p>The problem isn&#39;t the nature of individual choices, as in your example of abusive marriages.  It&#39;s the necessity of making a choice in the first place.  </p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t matter how nice individual husbands are if you&#39;re effectively forced to marry in the first place, which was more or less the case in feudal and early capitalist societies.  (Thankfully, we&#39;ve mostly moved past that barbarism.)</p>

<p>If you <strong>have</strong> to make a choice, the choice isn&#39;t voluntary.  The American legal system, at least, does not recognize choices made under <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duress_in_American_law">duress</a> as voluntary, such as a signed contract or sexual consent given after some sort of threat.</p>

<p>In this case, the factor of duress is the implicit threat of starvation.  In your theoretical Belgian Free State, there would be no social safety net to depend upon, and charity isn&#39;t always reliable.  </p>

<p>Take this metaphor:  if you were drowning in a lake, and anyone who could save you would force you to pay $20 for the service, could your payment truly be called voluntary?  The alternative is death.</p>

<p>Additionally, homesteading and squatting are moot points with private property privileges.  Without an occupancy-and-use standard, there&#39;s nothing to stop a few tycoons to scoop up all arable land on the planet, and without nations, there are no international waters or agreements to leave certain territories &quot;free,&quot; such as the Moon, Antarctica, and outer space.  (I am not arguing for nations, but simply against your ideology.)</p>

<p>In your &quot;anarcho&quot;-capitalist society, there are really only three &quot;choices:&quot;  Work for a boss, break the law by squatting or homesteading in a world where all land is already owned, or die.</p>

<p>Side note:  I don&#39;t oppose free trade.  I simply find capitalists&#39; definition of free trade deficient.  There is no free trade when all ideas are patented, all land is enclosed, and all disobedience is illegal.</p>

<p>An anarcho-capitalist society would quickly fall into the trap of balancing a commitment to freedom with an ideological preference for the hierarchical state of society.</p>

<p>Without a state to enforce intellectual property, private property privileges, and anti-union laws, there would be nothing to impair a workers&#39; movement, peaceful or not, from radically reshaping society.  It helps that they have the numerical advantage, as well.</p>

<p>Either the capitalist would be forced to allow themselves to become horridly obsolete, betraying capitalism, or they would bring down the full power of authority upon striking workers and unionists, betraying anarchism.</p>

<p>Sorry for that long-winded rant, anyway.  I hope you got something out of that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t get a whole lot out of it because I disagree with a central tenet. You say &quot;The only way to ensure that these rents end up paid is through force and coercion, such as a state&quot; and I would say you are forgetting ostracism, which is neither force nor coercion. If someone engages in fraud, you and your community stop trading with them (until they make restitution or whatever). You don&#39;t need a state, or force to enjoy private property and common law.</p>

<p>Before you say &quot;ostracism is coercion&quot;, it&#39;s not. Not having sex with someone is not coercion, it&#39;s an entirely peaceful way of saying &quot;no thanks&quot;.</p>

<p>About the &quot;not-voluntary if the consequence is death&quot; argument, I&#39;m trying to point out that it&#39;s a straw man. The consequence of not eating is death. But it&#39;s still your choice to decide when, where, how much you eat. The consequence of not &quot;working&quot;, meaning fighting entropy, is death. This is as true for a little crab on the beach as it is for man. You have to do actions to get things. It&#39;s just nature. It&#39;d be like a hermit crab complaining that he lives a life of coercion because shells are scarce. That scarcity is a function of us living on earth.</p>

<p>By your definition, everyone all the time is in a state of coercion, because resources are scarce. The fact that I have to get out of bed to go pee is coercion, not voluntary, because if I don&#39;t do it, I&#39;ll die.</p>

<p>There are NOT only three choices (you said work for a boss, squat illegally, or die). I am an entrepreneur in a rather free market, I don&#39;t have a boss. My wife also doesn&#39;t have a boss, as we&#39;ve agreed I should pay for her living expenses. My children also do not.</p>

<p>You say you&#39;re an anarchist, so I just ask if your system would allow for my type as mine allows for yours. You can be a mutualist, be a commie, in ancap world. Can I print money and trade freely in mutualist world? </p>

<p>If so, I would argue that I am enjoying a free market, where I&#39;m freely trading capital, and would call that capitalism. If not, then you must be suggesting the use of force to stop me from free trade, right? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure, I wouldn&#39;t stop you.  I just highly doubt anyone would willingly sacrifice their own working autonomy just to follow your orders, however.  Being an equal partner generally is more appealing than being a subservient minion.</p>

<p>Furthermore, just because work is necessary for survival doesn&#39;t mean that the current form that work takes <em>in today&#39;s society</em> is necessary for survival.  </p>

<p>Bosses paying their workers less than they&#39;re worth, people having to pay rents just to farm land, etc., are individuals and governments unfairly taking advantage of others needs to become more powerful, and I find that at least a little immoral.</p>

<p>People should at least have free land and resources to provide for basic subsistence without having to beg others for table scraps.  That&#39;s what a commons is for.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great! If your system doesn&#39;t stop me from enjoying a free market, and respects my private and personal property rights (in which I would be trading capital), then I would define it as anarcho-capitalist. And maybe we&#39;re dreaming of the same world with different names?</p>

<p>I would like to continue the convo though, you mention bosses paying workers less than their worth. I would like to ask you who defines that worth?</p>

<p>If I am happy to cut my neighbors grass for $5 an hour (I love my neighbor, and I&#39;m already cutting mine anyway), who is to say whether or not he is paying me less than my worth? Isn&#39;t that completely up to me and my neighbor? If the relationship is consensual, and voluntary, what makes it immoral? </p>

<p>I would argue that the only immoral actor in that scenario would be a third party (currently the state, or maybe you?) saying &quot;NO NO, you CAN&#39;T hire him for that much, I will stop you from doing it, he&#39;s worth more!&quot; Now that third party has used force to interfere in a consensual relationship. Currently minimum wage laws are doing this exactly. </p>

<p>But when you say &quot;people should have free land and resources&quot; that&#39;s when I know we&#39;re really on different pages. Resources aren&#39;t free, they require work. Land is scarce. Resources are scarce. If you want to give away yours &quot;for free&quot; to some people, I applaud you (I am charitable too). But when most folks say &quot;X should be free! Healthcare should be free. Education should be free! Food should be free!&quot; What they&#39;re saying is they support the forced transference of that property from one group to another, which again meets my definition of immoral. Food isn&#39;t free, somebody has to work for it. And land isn&#39;t free either, it generally requires work to be habitable. And even if you did steal it from me and give it to the homeless guy, I would hardly call that free. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t mean to insult you, but when I hear someone say &quot;X should be free&quot;, it sounds juvenile. Remember, being a kid, didn&#39;t you say to yourself, like I did: &quot;damnit why do they want money for candy, candy should be free!&quot; And then you grow up a little bit and realize everything has a natural cost to it. For an anarchist, you sound exactly like a big-statist, because they too have the illusion that there&#39;s a wand that can be waved to make things free. The truth behind the illusion of course is that they&#39;re advocating violence and theft, and the destruction of private property and human rights.</p>

<p>The idea that everyone could enjoy free subsistence resources.. we&#39;re talking about feeding and clothing and housing 7 billion people? For <em>free</em>? No cost to anyone? Do the resources just rain from the sky? That&#39;s magic, that&#39;s heaven. I&#39;d love to be a part of that too, but we&#39;re in the wrong universe!</p>

<p>This is demonstrably false. Voting on legislation is a thing. Whether you want to accept it or not, you have some fucking agency, however miniscule, over who gets in and who gets the boot. You can look at behavior, and decide if you&#39;re willing to be complicit or facilitate change.</p>

<li>Media has its inherent biases, obviously. Demographics are a thing. Also, media literacy needs to be a thing. Too many people are fuckin&#39; incapable  of making the distinction between verifiable info, and unsourced, facebook-tier horseshit. </li>
<li>America is run by corporate interests. On that, pretty much any rational person with a cursory understanding of reality knows this shit. Pray tell, which party seems to <strong>always</strong> vote unanimously in their favor? Which party <strong>always</strong> seems to invoke God, cataclysm, imminent danger (distractions), whilst committing the most shady deals here and abroad (privatized military contracts, de-regulating banking institutions, lowering taxes for the elite class, stagnating wages on the lower castes, union busting, tax havens and re-patriation practices, revisionist history, dissolving separation of church and state, militarizing local police, voting against data encryption or open access to the web as a basic utility in this age... etc.)? One of these things is not like the other.</li>

    <div class="md"><p>While I agree politicians could care less what side they are on and vast majority are just rotten with corruption. I do see &quot;left&quot; and &quot;right&quot; views in issues.  Most people sway left/right per issue. Some people will sway one way on vast majority of issues and to me they are left/right wingers. </p>

<p>I also believe a lot of extreme views are mislabeled on both sides. My father is as right wing as any even has a picture of Reagan in his ol home office(plus....his exwife is retired air traffic controller) but like 99% of right leaning people I know, he has no issues with gays at all. My more left wing friends aren&#39;t opposed to voter ID and think PC has gone too far</p>

How can there be so much hate and derision when we have a common goal, we should be cooperating and making compromises. If they really wanted America to be great they&#39;d be working togather towards that goal instead of working against each other to prevent it. I guess they&#39;d rather rule over nothing than not have any power in a Utopia.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see no sign of authoritarianism from the right, far from it lol. The essence of conservative &#39;right&#39; wing ideology is small government and keeping it out of peoples lives, free and open markets, self-responsibility/individualism, and a respect for western values and tradition. That hasnt changed but since Trump is more lefty on government it has begun to shift folks on the right more towards the lefts worldview on the role of government as we see with the healthcare debate. More and more republicans now think its the governments job to provide healthcare to all as opposed to people being responsible and buying health insurance on a free and open market.</p>

<p>In Europe its leftism all the way down. They are all big government socialists with the only difference being whether they want open borders or stricter borders</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK.  Putin&#39;s &quot;manufactured consent&quot; is somehow better?  Why is that?  You know that a whole bunch of journalists over there have been killed.. Doesn&#39;t that cause you some concern?</p>

<p>If you can&#39;t or won&#39;t trust any of the Western news sources- and there are many, all supposedly independent, then what is the point of talking to you about anything?  You&#39;re 100% unreachable on everything and therefore useless.   </p>

<p>The reason I (tentatively) trust the news sources is that there&#39;s So many of them.  BBC, Bloomberg Al Jazeera, NPR, NBC, ABC, the WSJ, the NYT, The Atlantic, Mother Jones, Drudge, Salon, TalkingPointsMemo, Busfeed, Politico, Slate, and a hundred others.  </p>

<p>If one of them were saying something substantially different then the other news-outlets would either pursue it to disprove it or corroborate it.   They&#39;re in competition, which ultimately makes them somewhat honest.   That&#39;s how it&#39;s supposed to work.</p>

<p>If you think it&#39;s all a gigantic - 500+ news-outlet conspiracy to fool you then I think that&#39;s not a supportable position.  I don&#39;t see the world that way.     Conspiracies do sometimes exist, but I don&#39;t believe that one does.</p>

<p>I think you should reconsider.  You can be skeptical, but you run the risk of being so doubtful that you disconnect from reality.. and that&#39;s bad.  </p>

<p>Thx</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think they compete.  I think they parrot what they&#39;re told.  What I see is you have one side catering to nationalists led by the drudge report and to a lesser extent fox news.

<p>The left wing media pretty much follow the narrative of the new york times and cnn.</p>

<p>We now have a third option which is the Internet.  And I feel that the same forces that control the main stream media are at work in the Internet flooding it with bullshit that people like you ad I have to sift through to find little nuggets of truth here and there.  </p>

<p>But the whole thing is designed to make the average person, making a living and not having the time or money to actually travel around the world doing research, come to this conclusion:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Funnily enough I was thinking about this on a semi-unrelated topic last night. People were shitting on white males who get all pent up over the &#39;white males are responsible for everything bad&#39; debate. I decided to challenge their post regarding this in order to try and see things from their side (not my own personal view bare in mind). Here&#39;s my reply to someone who had the maturity to challenge his own perspective:</p>

<p>I just like to try to see both sides of the coin. It&#39;s something society severely lacks and challenging our own perceptions or in the least, attempting to just understand someone&#39;s point (admittedly the hardest thing in the world when you 100% disagree) just goes a little way to developing a more united society. We&#39;re being torn down the middle by the powers that be and the only way to overcome that is to at least entertain someone elses view. I have my lines in the sand, but so long as someone is willing to hear me out then I&#39;m happy to wipe that line out, if only for a moment.</p>

<ul>
<li>left and right wing segregation will slowly diminish as we give someone we don&#39;t agree with an ear. I believe the more we open ourselves up to others, in turn they will eventually do the same. On the other hand however, a part of me believes society is too far gone. This world has accepted control with open arms with way too many unwilling to budge on their views over the most trivial of matters. I hope that part of me is wrong, but more than this I fear that I&#39;m right.</li>

    <div class="md"><p>It is arbitrary. Atleast with the left. Putting a political spectrum for only capitalism could be acceptable, ranging from radical socdems to ancaps.</p>

<p>Socialism is impossible to fit on a spectrum of that kind because it&#39;s a negation of capitalism, not an ideal of its own. And the spectrum is based on ideals.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yet you caould also make the reverse case. Lets make a comparison of the last things you listed.</p>

<p>Capitalism/earning: Your earnings are determined by your employer</p>

<p>Socialism/earning: Your earnings are based on the use value of your own production, meaning you can determine how hard you work and for what result.</p>

<p>Capitalism/Labor: your labor is commodified meaning the market determines your labor</p>

<p>Socialism/Labor: Your labor is free to be used however you like it, though the quantity of your labor determines what your recieved.</p>

<p>Capitalism/Life: Your life is threatened by money meaning your labor needs to be spent as commodities for other people.</p>

<p>Socialism/life: To all according to their needs.</p>

<p>Simplyfing the differences between capitalism and socialism to a spectrum makes it practically useless. As you can see, this kind of simplification makes it easy to call both sides economically libertarian/authoritarian.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>FYI, Left and Right does have meaning; it&#39;s just been butchered over the years. I&#39;m on the Left, which means that I support economic policies that are in the interest of poor and working-class people, as opposed to the rich. I want a much higher minimum wage, good social services, higher taxation for the rich. That&#39;s what the term has historically meant.</p>

<p>The &quot;identity politics&quot; bullshit has complicated things. I&#39;m anti-identity politics. </p>

<p>But I do try to bridge the gap between left and right with libertarians who are opposed to the drug war. In my opinion ending the drug war is the most important issue of our day, and we can get support for it from both left-progressives and right-libertarians, and it&#39;s imperative that this coalition continues to be built and ends the drug war. Ideally, a pro-freedom left-right coalition could work to end mass surveillance and reign in the unchecked power of the intelligence community as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You mistake me.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not supporting Trump in this. I supported him being elected but this presidency is pretty much convincing me it was all a show the whole time.</p>

<p>And your girl is no better.  A pitbull that when after the women her husband serially abused while acting like some sort of patron saint of women&#39;s issues.</p>

<p>No one in these parties at the grassroots level is anything other than a decent human being with strong ideas about how the country ought to be run.  Their entire career is a vetting process by groups like the CFR to see who will play ball.  Thinking your guy is great and the other side&#39;s guy is a monster is exactly fine with them since whichever one you choose is their pawn.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Collectivism is the root of our issues. People are inherently different and as a result, have opposing views oh the human condition. Only no person is willing to embrace their individual thoughts and defend them. We all throw them away to join the bandwagon of others &quot;with whom we share views.&quot; The catch is those groups formed are no longer interested in nurturing their views but rather engaging in a war with those who harbor opposing views. This is what is commonly referred to as &quot;us versus them.&quot; People start seeing victory in the losses of their opponents and fail to realize that when one group loses, we all lose.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>it&#39;s true that the left/right dichotomy is false and propagated to dissovle and prevent solidarity, but there are continuums of cosomological, ethical/moral, authoritarian/libertarian, mutualistic/individualistic ontological orientations that makes our simplistic republican form of govt the untenable mess is now, and are why dog whistles work so well. </p>

<p>right now there is a growing call for a red/brown alliance to &quot;defeat the establishment, the deep state, and imperialism.&quot; the primary proponents of this alliance are the alt right (their own chosen name) and progressive left (their own chosen name). </p>

<p>while an alliance seems like a very grand idea and their joint goal a noble one, it all breaks down if you make each side define what they mean by &quot;defeat,&quot; &quot;establishment,&quot; &quot;deep state, and &quot;imperialism.&quot; it breaks down even further when you ask them who they want to replace the establishment with. when you do this you find their common ground is very shallow and based not on an overarching agreement of how this country should be governed, but pissed off people who want to make those who pissed them off pay for pissing them off. they have very amorphous and contradictory ideas about who, how, why, and when this retribution will be carried out and redressed.</p>

<p>there is no way for these two self-identified groups would ever be able to settle on a single candidate to represent them without a common enemy to unite them. however, once in power, their common enemy seemingly vanquished simply by their having won an election, they will fight each other and grow to hate each other with more bile than the generic right and left do now, because they really are quite different ontologically.</p>

<p>as verboten as i know it is to say here, but as a proud conspiracist, the goal should not be getting people on board with pet conspiracies, but formulating and executing a plan to nullify current ones and prevent future ones. trying to solve a conspiracy is fun, but it is just masturbatory self indulgence if the real goal isn&#39;t to use what we know fix the overarching circumstances--boiling water from a contaminated well, instead of digging a new well where the water is clean. right now--seth rich, 9/11, JFK, pizzagate etc are all just focusing on who contaminated the well, interesting, but unhelpful in the long run.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Really, you see no difference between a party that is denying science, using a state run propaganda media outlet for &#39;news&#39;, cult like adoration and belief of Trump, and the left? </p>

<p>They are not the fucking same and are far far from it. When our elected officials fuck up we on the left call them out for it. I had plenty of conversations about Obamas flaws with my friends. Yet the right acts like they worship the republican party and disbelief of the blatant lies they tell is like disbelief of the bible. These people are off their rockers and nuts. </p>

<p>We are nothing fucking like them, it is not &#39;created&#39; to make us fight, we hate the right for what they stand for, how they treat women, how they take away our healthcare, how &#39;librul tears&#39; are a funny fucking joke and not the fact that people lives are being destroyed by idiotic republican policies. And I like drinking fucking water without getting diarrhea so give me back my fucking EPA you right wing twats.</p>

<p>Only people who believe that the right and left are alike are ignorant or right wing people trying to make themselves feel like they are on the same level as the &#39;elite libruls&#39;. We are not on their level at all we are way fucking above them. Not because elite, but because they have dug their dumb asses so deep in shit and keep digging.</p>
