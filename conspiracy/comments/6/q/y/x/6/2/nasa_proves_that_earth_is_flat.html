<p>-Professor Jerome Dobson</p>

<p>For the first time in history, <em>it seems</em>, scientists have measured how FLAT the Earth is.</p>

<p>There seems to be no curvature in any of the states they measured</p>

<p>They are indeed as flat as flat can be.</p>

<p>Wake up! </p>

<p>This is THE conspiracy.</p>

<p>We are trying to be controlled in every facet of life, down to the very nature of where we live.</p>

<p>Do not become a slave to the lies.</p>

<p>The Earth is flat and motionless.</p>

<p>Their focus was <strong>human perception of flatness</strong>—since the point of the study, Dobson told me, was largely to combat public perceptions about Kansas’s flatness. (Those translate, he says, to public perceptions about Kansas’s boringness.) To estimate geographical flatness as perceived by the human eye, Dobson and Campbell put math behind the experience of looking toward the horizon and seeing a rise of land (in their case, to the height of a tall tree at a distance of three miles). From there, Dobson says, “we put together a simulation”—one that approximates “what you would see if were standing on one spot, and turning around 360 degrees, and recording what you see every 16 times as you turn around.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;But the study’s focus on Kansas, it turns out, was also misleading. Because there are states—six of them, to be specific—that are even flatter than Kansas. The states flatter than a pancake, you could say, could be served in a short stack.&quot;</p>

<p>That&#39;s like saying &quot;why isn&#39;t there a crocoduck&quot; - you can&#39;t refute mainstream science by challenging statements that <em>no one&#39;s ever made</em>.</p>

<p>Gravity is very weak compared to magnetism, I&#39;m not sure if you can get that kind of effect out in space - and down on earth, earth&#39;s gravity is stronger than the basketball do you get that?</p>

<p>However, you can easily do that with magnets.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So why can I see objects that have disappeared when I increase my elevation?</p>

<p>For example. If a Ship sails over the horizon one way to bring it back into view is to increase my elevation. Shouldnt this be impossible if haze was the reason why it was obscured?</p>

<p>Im still seeing as far if not further but for some reason an increase in elevation will bring objects into view that according to you are obscured by atmo. </p>

<p>Because increasing your elevation means you can see further because the Earth is a globe. </p>

<p>Can you source out what kind of densities we are looking at and how the affect vision?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What youre saying makes no sense. </p>

<p>If the reason vision is limited on a FE is because of the &quot;haze&quot; as you call it then elevation should have little affect on the total distance I can see. </p>

<p>You can see further because a higher elevation increases your total line of sight. </p>

<p>Just pause and think about what youre saying. As for my quick math (And I would like to see yours) density isnt affected until 8km so everything under that should adhere to your theory that haze is to blame, right?</p>

<p>Dude we are talking an elevation of 10 feet can bring ships over the horizon into view, how much less dense is the air at 10ft vs ground? </p>

<p>How did you come to your calculations? Or at the very least if you dont know the math where can I find your source?</p>

<p>For fucks sake, this is like a high school science fair project these days and all you need is around 200 bucks, and an iq of 80. If you pass around a hat at your next dipshits anonymous meeting I&#39;m sure you could scrounge up the money... I mean debt. The second requirement might be a little harder to come by, but you could try hanging out around the special education department at your local jr high with a bag of candy and trick one of the dumber ones into helping you.</p>

This is a new law.
Im sure it has nothing to do with the growing number of flat Earthers.</p>

<p>It is sad that all posts countering a flat Earth argument seem always include some king of low brow &quot;your an idiot&quot; insult.</p>

<p>You just cant be mature about this can you?</p>

<p>All NASA shills? No. But do you honestly think every news article on the interwebz is telling the truth?</p>

<p>Take the first link you posted. Why is that string so bendy? Im sure whatever is making the string bendy could not possible effect the horizon and make it look curvy as well.... could it?</p>

<p>Bro. Look at your post history, you&#39;re doing the same shit. (also, you&#39;re an idiot*)</p>

<p>You sir, are a imbecile.</p>

<p>But do not come whining back to me when you choose a cloudy ass day and don&#39;t understand why you could not see past your hand because youre an idiot.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because that is why I am here dumbass!</p>

<p>I know the Earth is flat!</p>

<p>I want to spread the truth I have gained, for it is a benefit to me and I want it to benefit others!</p>

<p>What benefit do these idiots have calling other &quot;brainless&quot; and &quot;retarded&quot; all hours of the day? If they TRULY believed that they would just let them be, because others should realize that too right? </p>

<p>Or is there is something these stupid shills are afraid of, like people realizing that flat Earth is a reality?</p>
