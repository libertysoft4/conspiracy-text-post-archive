    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been thinking recently, looking at how formulaic posts on the_donald are (I do agree with some of their views, but you can&#39;t say that that subreddit is the place to find intelligent discourse when 90% of the posts are less than 10 words).... I&#39;ve been thinking, do you know how AI chatbots learn? Like how they taught Tay-Tay to be racist?</p>

<p>They just learn phrases and responses and stuff based on what other people have said. Then when someone asks them a question or something, they just give a similar response to what someone else said before. Now, if you go to cleverbot or a similar chat robot, and you open 2 tabs, and copy+paste the responses back and forth, it&#39;s a eerily humanlike conversation.</p>

<p>So really, when I look at a board like Politics or The_donald, that&#39;s all I see. Even if there are a lot of humans there, they&#39;re just conditioned to give the same responses like they&#39;re robots. It&#39;s just really weird. Just a bunch of programmed responses to each other, manufactured so that outsiders looking in are fooled into thinking this is real.</p>

<p>Not as fun a story as I was hoping for, someone saying their a shill doesn&#39;t mean they are telling the truth.. Nor does it prove they are shills in any way shape or form, you want a mod to ban someone based on the off chance they weren&#39;t lying? Do you really think shills would be going around telling people they are shills? Unless of course it&#39;s a double bluff, ah ha, say they are shills so people don&#39;t think they are.. Or maybe it&#39;s a triple bluff..</p>

<p>Pretty much all of the big subs are bad. Reddit is terribly designed for discussion, the upvote system naturally creates hiveminds where popularity wins out over correctness and low effort contributions are rewarded more than high effort is.</p>

<p>Care to show evidence?
I was banned a week ago without explanation after making a few logical points that got a moderate amount of attention even though being downvoted to hell, and I didnt break the rules of the sub. A lot of the comments people make there break the rules of the sub but they are making fun of conservatives so then their incivility is ignored.</p>

<p>Because subreddit&#39;s are ran by users, and those users can run it pretty much how they please.
R/politics seems to be an &quot;official&quot; sub or something and seems to have administration all the way from the top. Ofc I can&#39;t prove it but the amount of traffic, fake or not, would logically get attention from corporate. If it really is ran by some random users then they are certainly receiving promotion from corporate, and it is not called r/liberalpolitics  but instead tries to falsely bill itself as unbiased just from the name alone. </p>

<p>Err... Reddit is mostly young people, young people are more likely to be liberal, it&#39;s not hard to put two and two together here.
There are plenty of anti authoritarian young people and r/politics is ALL about authority. The people that want the government to prosecute hate speech and whatnot are a VOCAL minority.</p>

<p>and they do this by banning any arguments that go against authority and neo-liberalism while promoting shills and bots.
I&#39;m just commenting from my own experience mostly but it&#39;s very obvious that sub is infested with bots and shills just look for yourself. Anyone with half a brain and time can deduce as much.</p>

<p>Do you really think shills would be going around telling people they are shills? 
This guy ACCIDENTALLY let it slip that he &quot;worked for his country&quot; and was trying to say he works in IT security which to me seems very likely to have been from a paid shill when you take into account human psychology. It&#39;s anecdotal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nothing. I go over and kill some karna every now and then. If you ask them for facts or point out their hypocrisy they stop responding and only downvote you. All of Reddit has become so strange, I recently switched to iOS and the official Reddit app won&#39;t let me filter out subs that Reddit is fun did on Android. So now I see the Trump spam and other bs subs. I hate that the conversations I used to have on politics are gone. For instances, I have no problem with gays serving openly, I served 8 years and ran a large avionics shop. My 2 best workers were lesbian and I would rather work with them to get a job done then the men in my shop. I hated sick bay commandos, people who stubbed their toe and had to go to medical. We had a lot of these people too. They didn&#39;t affect readiness because I didn&#39;t count on then at all, they weren&#39;t bad people, they were just useless in my eyes. Every trans person I&#39;ve ever met seems to have just come from the doctor or is telling me about their next appointment, and really wants to tell about them. But here&#39;s where I think the American people really get screwed by letting trans serve. These people will go to medical for everything, which I should have done. I worked in really dangerous places I.e war zone, carrier flight deck, test cell, air refueling, but I never went to medical for anything and got out with 0% disabled, in the VA&#39;s eyes I almost didn&#39;t serve. Some trans that goes to medical all the time, build up their VA percentage and would probably take about 2 years to get 100%, which means 100% medical and dental for life, including paying for their transition. Then they can get out and be interviewed to CNN about how they honorably served. I know people really fucked up from serving their country who only get 20 or 30% and people who never did shit get 100%. </p>

<p>My opinion, but a few years ago I could have this discussion over at politics. If I posted that opinion over there now, I&#39;d be compared to Hitler slaughtering the Jews for not standing up to trans rights. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was AIMD, so I worked mostly on components from aircraft, so I could say all of them. I also worked on a system called buddy stores, air-to-air refueling, so I spent some time on the flight deck, fucking nuts is the best way to describe it. Testing engines on a test cell was also fun and crazy too. </p>

<p>The long term medical is never considered in the debates I&#39;ve heard, just the first while active. I don&#39;t know the right answer, as I&#39;m sure some trans will be great solders, but it seems like a stupid debate to be honest as it&#39;s such a small percentage. The military is and needs to be mission based, not a barometer for social change. </p>

<p>I served from 91 - 98, and the F-18 seemed like a disposable aircraft, by that I mean we sent most parts on to depot (manufacturing) or tossed and replaced. The F-14 were my favorite to look at and watch fly, but least favorite to fix. The older helos had to leak to fly, if it wasn&#39;t leaking, it was out of fluid. So it seems with more advanced electronics more mainframe will be privatized, but not all. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s pretty much OVER for r/politics (just like r/news became a useless tool).  Last year they began removing content and changed their rules drastically, which included discontinuing &quot;self-post saturdays.&quot;  The mods and jr. mods even went back months to remove posts/links (this affected searches more than anything).  I have no proof of this--but I&#39;m pretty sure other users or mods of this sub will back me up on this (regarding the removals).  </p>

<p>In the original post which r/politics made to discontinue self-post saturdays--they said they might bring them back after the election (never happened).  I think that was in April or May 2016.</p>

Like I said, if you dont believe me try it yourself for a couple weeks and see how long it takes you to get banned but judging from what ive observed if you make enough logical points and they get attention then eventually you will be banned without explanation. Also when I witnessed this the comments that got the accounts banned were on posts that had thousands of comments and the original post was from a liberal source critical of trump or something similar.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just because someone is outraged with a false narrative and blatant propaganda that doesnt mean they are supporters of Trump. They might be anti-authoritarian and support decentralization for example. Normal people dont sit on reddit all day and may not understand the nuances of each sub and may mistake fake shills for real people and not realize that any dissenting opinions get deleted/banned. That creates a false narrative and makes a vocal minority seem like an organic majority.

    <div class="md"><p>Theyre currently shutting down free speech ironically. I understand that it&#39;s in their right to do pretty much whatever they want but r/politics doesnt deserve to be credible anymore. It&#39;s atrocious that r/politics appears at the top of the webpage and isnt reported on by mainstream media. A massive shilling operation that &quot;colludes&quot; with admins and mods would actually be a good story yet you will never see it on CNN or MSNBC. It&#39;s amazing that people do not demand more quality from their media sources and even if I agreed with the narrative presented on r/politics I would be outraged that political discourse is actively discouraged. People should want the truth and for arguments to be logically debated and dissected because if the argument is correct then challenges to that argument only serve to make it stronger. R/politics is a disservice to all sides of the political spectrum. </p>

I dont know how to prove it otherwise but anyone that has experience or has witnessed this knows its true.

    <div class="md"><p>The problem is that using multiple accounts to evade bans could get my IP shadow banned from other subs besides the cess pool that is r/politics, but if i manage to do so I will make a thread on conspiracy. Anyway you sound emotionally invested in r/politics&#39; credibility. I cant imagine why, and why the hell would I lie? I have &quot;witnessed&quot; people banned from there multiple times without them breaking the rules of the sub and that is simply a fact, although I lack evidence it is true and other people echo my experience so why reject their claims 100 percent instead of keeping an open mind? </p>

<p>Why not do an experiment yourself and find out for yourself? What do you have to lose if you love r/politics so much why not try to defend their credibility? I admit that it may be certain mods that engage in this behavior and not an orchestrated &quot;conspiracy&quot; but there is such a thing as turning a blind eye and claiming plausible deniability. It&#39;s not in their interest to investigate &quot;rogue&quot; mods if that is what is going on but it may actually be more deliberate than that. Why do you think this post received so much attention if OP&#39;s claims are completely false?</p>

<p>Are you really trying to tell me that r/politics and the people moderating that sub are actually trying to promote open political discourse? Why are posters that say rude things about conservatives ignored but even the smallest trivial &quot;incivility&quot; towards liberals used as an excuse to shut down their opinions? I&#39;ll admit that most of the bans i have witnessed have been with the excuse of incivility but I have seen people at least twice banned without a good reason other than they were providing logical and concise arguments proving hypocrisy in the left&#39;s narrative or challenging BAD SCIENCE like global warming and their comments received moderate amounts of attention despite being downvoted to hell. If the liberal arguments were so strong then wouldn&#39;t the mods want people to challenge them so that they can provide proof and rationality to support their points of view even stronger?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I saw a guy get banned for questioning global warming and another for showing logically that libs were okay with opposition research from Russian sources like the pee pee dossier which was actually fake which makes it worse but it was against Trump so they liked it but then screamed collusion when Trump Jr. was trying to dig up dirt on shillary, hypocrisy. I cant find the posts now but in the future I will make sure to screencap when this happens. I also saw a person banned for using smiley faces and emojis while providing support for a conservative argument YET if you go to r/politics posters there mock and are uncivil towards trump supporters and are never banned. They are obviously biased and will resort to outright banning arguments that are too logical and get too much attention. If you dont believe me try it yourself. </p>
