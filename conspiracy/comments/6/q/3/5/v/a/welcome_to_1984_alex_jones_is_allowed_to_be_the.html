        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Welcome to 1984, where censoring &quot;fake news&quot; has turned into censoring news that is not appreciated by the powerful while I see more Alex Jones&#39; stories than ever. We&#39;re almost at a point where we may not even hear news that highlights the bad things of powerful corporations. We&#39;ll still see bad political news because the sides are entrenched against each other. That is unless you just read news from one side of the spectrum. But don&#39;t look for much opposition to the next Iraq War to be in the media or available in search results. Freedom of information is the most dangerous things to people who want the status quo.</p>

<p>article that gave me this idea: <a href="http://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2017/07/28/pers-j28.html">http://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2017/07/28/pers-j28.html</a></p>

<p>&quot;During the month of May, Google searches including the word “war” produced 61,795 WSWS impressions. In July, WSWS impressions fell by approximately 90 percent, to 6,613.</p>

<p>&quot;Searches for the term “Korean war” produced 20,392 impressions in May. In July, searches using the same words produced zero WSWS impressions. Searches for “North Korea war” produced 4,626 impressions in May. In July, the result of the same search produced zero WSWS impressions. “India Pakistan war” produced 4,394 impressions in May. In July, the result, again, was zero. And “Nuclear war 2017” produced 2,319 impressions in May, and zero in July.</p>

<p>&quot;To cite some other searches: “WikiLeaks,” fell from 6,576 impressions to zero, “Julian Assange” fell from 3,701 impressions to zero, and “Laura Poitras” fell from 4,499 impressions to zero. A search for “Michael Hastings”—the reporter who died in 2013 under suspicious circumstances—produced 33,464 impressions in May, but only 5,227 impressions in July.&quot;</p>

<p>They had to drown out Bill, hell they still do. </p>

<p>In my country they did this with the student nationalistic movements when they were perceived as a threat to the neo-communist party arrangements in the 90s. But in less then a year the spooks were the only members left. They had to keep up the charade for almost a decade, because they&#39;d had prompted them up as &quot;a danger to democracy&quot; and it was a couple of hundred young cops and agents LARPing as nationalists. Funny enough, those guys now run the show in the real police and agencies, and there&#39;s been a clear, honest, pivot to nationalism of all these institutions.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>exactly, it keeps them busy and it justifies their numbers and expenses (not that they&#39;d even actually need to justify shit) </p>

<p>But little poor Romania has 30 times more secret agents per capita than the US, nr 1 in the world. With it they control the Church, which is more or less an autonomous branch of the agency, all IT, and listen to pretty much anyone who&#39;s anyone. But their reigns are held in Langley, which isn&#39;t very picky about how you carry out their instructions. So when the new generation started to come into leadership roles, they started using the agency to &quot;seed&quot; positive changes. Lots of &quot;leaks&quot; and &quot;anonymous tips&quot; on corrupt politicians of all ranks, real nationalist parties left to grow and fight among themselves naturally, so that the one left at the end could stand a chance. Hell they even arrested some Mossad goons and approved warrants on 2 of the richest jews in Israel. </p>

<p>On the other hand i used to have a meter high file and all i ever did was smoke weed. Theoretically &quot;holocaust denial&quot; is a crime if you do it in public. In practice i&#39;ve got a couple of spooks in my secret FB group that shared my post of The greatest story never told on their main spook group and there were no comments condemning anything, just clarification questions. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Romania. </p>

<p>Unsurprisingly the complete control for ~20 years of all nationalist ideology by the secret services has resulted in us being the only eastern european nation that totally lacks any patriotic movement. </p>

<p>But it would be a huge risk to leave to chance the emergence of a new Zelea Codreanu. That guy was probably the only 100% clean nationalist leader of the interwar period. Everyone from generals, to the most illustrious professors, to artists, to the bishops, monks and priests, to workers, peasants and students, they all treated The Captain, in his early 30s, as the Romanian Messiah. Never in our history at least has a young man commanded such respect and adoration across society. When he finished law school and started the movement, the dean and the rector were among the first to not support him, but to be his disciples. </p>

<p>The Captain was murdered on the side of a road by the police, while he was being transported from the jail he&#39;d been held on fake charges. The movement degenerated instantly without him. </p>

<p>Just <a href="http://www.apologeticum.ro/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/capitanul-corneliu-zelea-codreanu.jpg">have a look at the man</a>. He was the incarnation of wisdom, determination, selfless love for the people and the land. He gathered all the best men of the nation and organized them to serve the needs of the nation.The communists tortured all these men for well over a decade. Our Katyn was a cement room where the moral and intellectual elite of our people was fed their own feces and beaten daily.  The survivors i&#39;ve met in my life were as close to ideal people as one can get, even at over 70yo, disciplined, strict, fair, trustworthy, altruistic and so on.  Even the communists avoided mentioning him in their &quot;anti-fascist&quot; historiographies after the war, because no amount of propaganda could ever hope to besmirch his memory. So there is no way the people ruling us then and now could ever tolerate a nationalistic movement in Romania, for every other generation a man like this rises. The previous genius born to our people was murdered 50 years prior for the same reason as him : renouncing all external control over our nation&#39;s destiny, a Romania of and for Romanians. His name was Eminescu, and he is our national poet and the one we consider to be the smartest ever born among us. </p>

<p>We, Romanians, are the most heinous of all people in how we treat the best among us. It&#39;s been our ruin for as long as we have existed and it&#39;s still just as prevalent to this day. For every Messiah, hundreds and hundreds of Judas are born. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>We&#39;ll still see bad political news because the sides are entrenched against each other. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Excellent point. The dysfunctional, divisive and paralyzing entrenchment of our political system <em>is by design</em>. It&#39;s a perfect go-to rationale as to why nothing that <em>really</em> helps the working people can ever get done.  </p>

<p>As to your supporting link...Even though I knew Google was doing this, I still found the the part I quote below to be really blatant and shocking. If we had a functional media this would be the kind of story they would be using to manufacture public outrage.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In April, under the guise of combatting “fake news,” Google introduced new procedures that give extraordinary powers to unnamed “evaluators” to demote web pages and websites. These procedures have been used to exclude the WSWS and other anti-war and oppositional sites.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>.....</p>

<blockquote>
<p>During the month of May, Google searches including the word “war” produced 61,795 WSWS impressions. In July, WSWS impressions fell by approximately 90 percent, to 6,613.</p>

<p>Searches for the term “Korean war” produced 20,392 impressions in May. In July, searches using the same words produced zero WSWS impressions. Searches for “North Korea war” produced 4,626 impressions in May. In July, the result of the same search produced zero WSWS impressions. “India Pakistan war” produced 4,394 impressions in May. In July, the result, again, was zero. And “Nuclear war 2017” produced 2,319 impressions in May, and zero in July.</p>

<p>To cite some other searches: “WikiLeaks,” fell from 6,576 impressions to zero, “Julian Assange” fell from 3,701 impressions to zero, and “Laura Poitras” fell from 4,499 impressions to zero. A search for “Michael Hastings”—the reporter who died in 2013 under suspicious circumstances—produced 33,464 impressions in May, but only 5,227 impressions in July.</p>

<p>In addition to geopolitics, the WSWS regularly covers a broad range of social issues, many of which have seen precipitous drops in search results. Searches for “food stamps,” “Ford layoffs,” “Amazon warehouse,” and “secretary of education” all went down from more than 5,000 impressions in May to zero impressions in July.</p>

<p>The number of search impressions for WSWS articles in searches including the term “strike” fell by 85 percent between May and July, from 19,395 to 2,964.</p>

<p>Many people who conduct Google searches for these terms do so because they are critical of establishment politics and would be interested in hearing what socialists have to say. However, as a result of Google’s actions, they will not find material published by the World Socialist Web Site.</p>

<p>But what about those directly looking for socialist politics? In May, the search term “socialism” generated 31,696 impressions, and the WSWS was ranked between 5th and 6th in search results. In June, the WSWS was removed from the top 100 search results for the term. Thus searches for “socialism” produced zero impressions for the World Socialist Web Site, the most widely read online socialist publication.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is why people need to use multiple search engines. </p>

<p>I also think this is a clear conspiracy to ...shape truth. The facts that there is no transparency to the &quot;evaluation process&quot; and the content evaluators for Google are unknown figures should bother everyone.</p>

<p>Just another chapter in the story of why companies like Google and Facebook are just fucking evil. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah! The daily anti alex jones thread.  </p>

<p>1st no one should be censoring ANYTHING.  You can think for yourself, right?  Use your brain and draw your own conclusions.  </p>

<p>2nd,  Your post makes not sense.  You attack infowars, but then ramble about a bunch of events and date...</p>

<p>Oh i got it. the point was to hate alex jones.  </p>

<p>Yeah, they are trying to bring him down because hes getting to public now.  </p>

<p>He throws these contents, giving away 20,000 $ to get on tv and expose &quot;bill clinton is a rapist&quot; or the CNN meme content or whatever.</p>

<p>Cant have someone out doing the MSM, so lets smear him and just say hes controlled op, with no proof, and nothing to back anything up.</p>

<p>A youtube video that some hater made...means nothing.</p>

<p>I dont view infowars as some source from heaven, but...its just a website.  Alex jones is JUST a radio host.</p>

<p>I see the CTR trolls and bots just making daily threads saying &quot;You DO hate alex jones, right?&quot;</p>

<p>No, i glance at his info.  Hes done some great things overall.  Why are you bots focusing in on JUST him...hmmm...geez...i wonder...i am dumby...hmmmm...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again have you even listened to the show recently? Obviously not if you think they promote Muslim hatred. It&#39;s not half truths. He just doesn&#39;t talk about Israel because he&#39;d be labeled a Nazi. Jones is almost always right, still is. If he&#39;s wrong he makes a retraction which is better than MSM already. Just because he doesn&#39;t constantly bash Jews doesn&#39;t mean he&#39;s as bad as MSM. That&#39;s absurd. I don&#39;t know why you&#39;re going on about Muslims now but whatever. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lies through omission? Like what? I don&#39;t know why you don&#39;t understand that jones can&#39;t go that route without losing everything. At least his listeners know who George Soros is. Like I said. Jones is not for heavy conspiracy theorists. He is more mainstream. If you want to hear about zionists I&#39;m sorry but you&#39;ll have to look elsewhere. Doesn&#39;t mean he isn&#39;t waking people up to some degree. </p>
