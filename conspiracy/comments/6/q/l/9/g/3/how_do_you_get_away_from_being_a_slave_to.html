I&#39;m 24 and have been working in a nasty, literally and metaphorically, Detroit factory and other factories since I was 19. I just quit my job about two weeks ago and I felt free. I felt like such a robot that some days during the week I wouldn&#39;t even know what day it was. Work, eat, sleep, repeat. I just want to enjoy my life without having to be a fucking slave to someone who makes 100x than me. What can be done about this? Anyone have advice? Please don&#39;t respond with the passive aggressive &quot;learn a trade&quot; or &quot;become your own boss&quot; answers. I just need some advice from some of you who are more knowledgeable on this subject. Thank you friends. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Both are good places to go to. Thai food is 100 times better than Khmer food. But, Cambodia is so much cheaper to actually live in. But, if you teach English in either countries, you can make so much money. I have a friend that is teaching in Vietnam and making abut $20an hour teaching English, with no college degree or anything like that, and she makes up her own hours. </p>

<p>In Cambodia, I think it&#39;s like $10-15 an hour but, if you work say 20 hours a week that&#39;s about $300 a month (tax free). </p>

<p>To me, it&#39;s a great life, especially if you get away from the touristy areas.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pretty much. That&#39;s what a lot of retiree&#39;s do. I taught English to kids living in poverty in a rural village/town.</p>

<p>100 degree weather all year round, and I had no A/C except for a tiny little fan. </p>

<p>But, I&#39;ve had so many life changing experiences there that made it all worth it. </p>

<p>I lived mostly with European and Australia/New Zealand foreigners. It was a very chill environment and everyone I met there was great and welcoming. It was very cool to compare our countries and our culture and such. I was the only American so I felt I had to live up to the stereotype of the American patriot, haha. </p>

<p>The locals were amazing to me. Most of the older folks were alive during the Khmer Rouge and were living in extreme poverty, but they were the happiest people I&#39;ve ever met.</p>

<p>One of my favorite thing to do were to bike around the villages and farms, and <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/aphs.worldnomads.com/nicola/23951/CIMG5336.jpg">I would have complete Khmer strangers call me over and invite me to drink with them at their homes</a>. </p>

<p>The whole environment is very chill, slow, and relaxed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t have the answers, but I have some experience as I haven&#39;t worked corporate jobs in over 3 years. You are right about everything becoming about money, so save it up when you work those Babylon jobs, don&#39;t waste it on luxury items or status symbols. Secondly, escaping from this slavery is very hard on your own, cooperation is key. Seek others you can trust. If you put your funds, minds, and effort, you increase your collective chances of escape.

<p>How much of your &#39;slavery&#39; is your mindset? Even if you are paid a low wage, if you are smart with your money you can save it. this will bring you untold satisfaction, especially if after, say, six months, you already have a couple of grand in the bank. You will come to see your job as a means to an end, rather than end in and of itself. All about mindset.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Does anyone actually experience untold satisfaction from having a few grand in the bank after six months of shit-work? I have a pretty positive outlook on life, I think, but you&#39;re essentially telling this guy to be happy and hope he doesn&#39;t have any emergency expenses pop up. </p>

<p>Gotta disagree and say the only way to win in this system is to be your own boss or to not participate. Employees get exploited for profit, ~99% of the time. Anyone who has been an employer understands the pressure to squeeze as much juice out of someone as possible for as little money as they&#39;ll take. We expect cows and horses to be happy with their lot in life. You&#39;re either the horse pulling the plow or the guy steering it. </p>

<p>Take that positive mindset and do something with it, instead of getting worn down to a cynical but obedient little stub by somebody else. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your post reminded me of one of my favorite movies: <em>Office Space</em>. It&#39;s a great film that resolves a situation similar to the one you&#39;re in quite nicely. I highly suggest you watch it for some guidance with what you&#39;re dealing with (if not, then at least for simple enjoyment).</p>

<p>I hope for the best.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Travel. Preferably to a <del>3rd world</del> developing country, like in sub-saharan Africa (excluding South Africa). In such a place even if you have only few skills, you will instantly be more employable than 90% of the population, simply by  the fact that you have western schooling. </p>

<p>Seriously I have been there myself. </p>

<p>You will find a much more relaxed end enjoyable lifestyle with adventure to boot. </p>

<p>Just go with a backpack and find backpackers places to stay in where you will quickly get to know people etc. A lot of places you can work as a barman etc. for a while until you save up for your next trip or whatever. </p>

<p>You can also join a volunteer org. who will send you there and you get a modest allowance. Once you are there, make connections and find real employment. </p>
