        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This is very terrifying to think about. Some of the most &quot;respected&quot; and powerful people in our society, are likely sexual sadists. </p>

<p>As somewhat of an amateur psychologist, I have spent hours delving into various solved murder cases and investigations, studying the process of finding evil people who commit terrible crimes.</p>

<p>What I find interesting are 2 main parallels among serial killers/sexual sadists. </p>

<ol>
<li>Many of these people are very charming and charismatic, able to fool normal people. The archetypal criminal who displays these traits is killer Ted Bundy. He was active in Republican Party politics, a law student, well spoken. He aspired to be governor one day according to testimony and was a promising candidate. These people like James Alefantis, Jimmy Saville, are able to fool you into thinking they are normal people with their charm, however, there is a Jekyl/Hyde type of thing going on with them. Who is to say our politicians and public servants, police, aren&#39;t potential sadists themselves?</li>
</ol>

<p>Here are a few examples of serial killers who used their <strong>status</strong> to kill. </p>

<p><strong>Gerard Shaefer- Police Sergant who murdered and raped several young girls.</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA41yu_aQQ8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA41yu_aQQ8</a> </p>

<p><strong>James Duckett- Murdered at least one girl, using his police status to lure her into his car, where he took her to a secluded area and raped/strangled her</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nq46nD-Hyek&amp;t=12s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nq46nD-Hyek&amp;t=12s</a></p>

<p><strong>Virginia Politician Charles Severance, serial killer convicted of 3 murders</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.newsweek.com/former-virginia-politician-charles-severance-convicted-three-murders-over-11-389836">http://www.newsweek.com/former-virginia-politician-charles-severance-convicted-three-murders-over-11-389836</a></p>

<p>This is just the tip of the iceberg folks. </p>

<p>Also.....</p>

<ol>
<li>The murders are SEXUALLY motivated. These people enjoy causing harm to their victims, because it satisfies deep psychotic sexual urges within them. </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Who is to say these psychos don&#39;t SEEK positions of power, to carry out these horrendous sexually motivated crimes?</strong></p>

<p>Who is to say many of our politicians and elite could be serial killers with MASSIVE body counts. The system protects these people and ensures they will never be caught, likely because there is a web that connects them all. One of them could talk, and they would all fall down.</p>

<p>This sort of justified the massive amount of money and media protection towards protecting the image of James Alefantis. Lots of resources were dedicated to portraying this man is simply an innocent pizza parlor owner, correct? </p>

<p>What are the elite really hiding? Do they suspect this guy is a little pussy who would talk and spill the beans to save his own skin if ever apprehended by police? There is clearly something more to this guy that doesn&#39;t meet the eye...</p>

<p>I suspect we have a group of mass murderers in positions of power, who relish in their evil, and do not believe in a heaven or hell or repercussions. This is very scary to think about. I wonder if any evidence can be linked to the elite, by delving into simple murder cases like Ted bundy or John Wayne gacy? </p>

<p>Mark dutrox for example, Belgian pedophile and kidnapper, was likely kidnapping children for elite customers who paid him to do so. He was used as a &quot;supplier&quot; for this network of European elite. This is an interesting concept..</p>

<p>I&#39;m glad you&#39;re back. Haven&#39;t seen you in awhile. </p>

<p>There is clearly a &quot;network&quot; of sexually sadistic people, who go on to accept roles and positions of influence and power over the masses. Secret societies like skull and bones recognize this potential, and they encourage it.</p>

<p>Lack of Empathy is a hallmark of our elite. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I highly doubt there is any large majority of these people who are men.  Narcissism and psychopathy are just as common or more common among women.  Women on the other hand can hide behind their gender and the stereotypes about it.</p>

<p>Women are almost always given the benefit of the doubt.  They are almost always believed to be telling the truth.  Most importantly, they are believed to be incapable of terrible acts.</p>

<p>For proof all you have to do is take a close look at police and court statistics.  Women are less than half as likely to be charged when caught completely red-handed committing a crime.  Women are less than half as likely to go to trial.  Women are less than half as likely to be convicted.  Women are less than half as likely to go to jail when convicted for the same crime.  </p>

<p>Women are also more violent towards children than men too.  They make up around 80% of child abuse and child sexual abuse.  They are also the perpetrator 70% of one directional domestic violence.  They simply get a pass because people believe that women are just not capable of such terrible acts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Life and Works of the Marquis de Sade regails the reader with quite a few instances where the elite practiced organised group occult sexual murder, 200+ years ago. No one should be shocked by this. It is apparently the way things really are, and the way things have been for a long while. Perhaps these people are drawn to positions of power because power means control...?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>An excellent summary. As a parent and as a human I don&#39;t want it to be true but my eyes have been opened to this for some time now. I don&#39;t know why it&#39;s so hard for most to recognize the possibility. There have always been sexually oriented networks catering to various fetishes and lifestyles (bondage groups, swingers etc) so it follows that the same would be true all the way down to the dregs.</p>
