        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Most of these entities are publicly traded companies with thousands of shareholders, who elect the board of directors, who appoint management. For example, Goldman Sachs&#39;s largest shareholder is a mutual fund company and holds a 2.15% stake, not nearly enough to control the bank&#39;s operations. </p>

<p>In the case of the Federal Reserve, the Board of Governors is appointed by the President/Congress (which are easy to influence), but monetary policy is set by the FOMC, which has a significant presence of regional bank presidents. These presidents are appointed by their respective local boards of directors, which have representatives of various interests. Not sure about the governance structures of other countries&#39; central banks. </p>

<p>I guess I am just struggling to understand how such a small group of individuals can supposedly exert such dominant influence over entities that have such decentralized governance structures. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I get confused because it seems like the roots are non-Zionist yet all of the political actions seem to be Zionist related- Iraq, Syria. The Zionists are cryto-masons? Why do the masons want to topple Iraq?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean, there is no one simple answer as with much of history but in my opinion Zionism really stems from Rome and the Khazars who converted to Judaism. Khazars are really just guarding the Holy Lands for Rome or the forces behind the Roman Empire. Obviously there are various factions warring with each other but as with most of these societies and what not, they are heavily compartmentalized.</p>

<p>To give a simple example of this would be the mafia and various mafia families. Warring at times but for the most part working together.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks man that helps a lot. I guess that&#39;s why people say the elites and not the elite.</p>

<p>If the Zionists are working for Rome, then Rome is completely trashing the reputation of Jewish people worldwide.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No problem and yes, they hide in plain view. Blaming Jews works in both the Khazars and Rome&#39;s favor. Keeps light off of them. If Roman banking schemes fail then they can just throw the Jews under the bus, even though they (Khazar bankers) are not Jews ethnically or religiously. Kind of like &quot;Republican in name only&quot;. </p>

<p>I mean it&#39;s blatanly obvious once you look deeper. Real Jews in Israel protest the Zionist State of Israel. That should be a huge red flag for people to start looking deeper into this. The biggest problem that I see is that people who are looking for the truth fail to dig as deep as they can into actual history. The root system for a tree is far larger than the trees height. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, seriously connecting dots for me. I think people get thrown off because they know the crimes of Zionists, but then historians like yourself come in and say actually black catholic nobility runs the world, which seems like a disconnect or to underplay the US wars in the middle east for Israel. Also a disconnect between Rothschild and masonry. I donno.</p>

<p>In an interview to Washington post on September 17, 1969, King Faisal is reported to have said &quot;We, the Saudi family are cousins of the Jews. We entirely disagree with any Arab or Muslim Authority which shows any antagonism to the Jews; but we must live together with them in peace. Our country (Arabia) is the Fountain head from where the first Jew sprang, and his descendants spread out all over the world.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Found some stuff about Wahhabi indoctrination in Saudi schools. They definitely are not fond of Jews, or any non- Wahhabi person.</p>

<p>Condemn and denigrate the majority of Sunni Muslims who do not follow the Wahhabi understanding of Islam, and call them deviants and descendants of polytheists.</p>

<p>Condemn and denigrate Shiite and Sufi Muslims&#39; beliefs and practices as heretical and call them &quot;polytheists;&quot;</p>

<p>Command Muslims to &quot;hate&quot; Christians, Jews, &quot;polytheists&quot; and other &quot;unbelievers,&quot; including non-Wahhabi Muslims, though, incongruously, not to treat them &quot;unjustly&quot;;</p>

<p>Teach the infamous forgeries, <em>The Protocols of the Elders of Zion</em>, as historical fact;</p>

<p>Teach other conspiracy theories accusing Freemasons, Lions Clubs and Rotary Clubs of plotting to undermine Muslims;</p>

<p>Teach that &quot;Jews and the Christians are enemies of the [Muslim] believers&quot; and that &quot;the clash&quot; between the two realms is perpetual;</p>

<p>Instruct students not to &quot;greet,&quot; &quot;befriend,&quot; &quot;imitate,&quot; &quot;show loyalty to,&quot; &quot;be courteous to,&quot; or &quot;respect&quot; non-believers;</p>

<p>Assert that the spread of Islam through jihad is a &quot;religious duty;&quot;</p>

<p>Instruct that &quot;fighting between Muslims and Jews&quot; will continue until Judgment Day, and that the Muslims are promised victory over the Jews in the end;</p>

<p>Include a map of the Middle East that labels Israel within its pre-1967 borders as &quot;Palestine: occupied 1948.&quot;</p>

<p>So yeah they really really don&#39;t like Jews.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The legend goes that its in the Bank of International Settlements where every banking deal goes through and they take a cut off the top. Think of it like any syndicate where the upper bosses take percentages or work out lower payments/rates for the bottom tier - in that way complete control can be enacted with informal or unofficial agreements [as well as the standard]. </p>

<p>Government is similar in a sense and more relatable. Where taxes come off the top one will never earn more than what is allowed. Spend more pay more tax. This prevents the necessary funds to be free [for savings or wealth accumulation] with earnings and also allows others to spend the productive value of money earned.</p>

<p>In their defence the entire money system is just fictional book-keeping. A world where everyone is rich but broke at the same time.</p>

<p>The perceived negative light is in keeping entire nations and people in perpetual debt and writing it off where needed. The problem most people see is when those debts are exchanged for tangible goods. Credit-default swaps, etc. So unlimited credit is extended and when it implodes the gold and other resources are used to pay off something fictitiously created on paper or in ledgers.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>These presidents are appointed by their respective local boards of directors, <strong>which have representatives of various interests.</strong> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>To a point. We must understand that these people are also a victim of mind manipulation and conditioned to believe in a certain way by those already in power/control. Yes there may be various interest but the main agenda stays the same. What I mean is there is a long con going on here, a conspiracy since over a century and some say much, much longer. I doubt a lot of those people gaining positions of power (presidents etc.) have a lot of empathy because they were prime candidates to get in the door to those who brainwashed them from he start.
It&#39;s truly a sick system. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I think the subject which will be of most importance politically is mass psychology... Various results will soon be arrived at :that the influence of home is obstructive... although this science will be diligently studied, it will be rigidly confined to the governing class. The populace will not be allowed to know how its convictions were generated. When the technique has been perfected, every government that has been in charge of education for a generation will be able to control its subjects securely without the need of armies or policemen... Educational propaganda, with government help, could achieve this result in a generation.  There are, however, two powerful forces opposed to such a policy: one is religion; the other is nationalism... A scientific world society cannot be stable unless there is a world government.&quot;</p>

Many of these members are elites in the media, politicians, foundations such as the Clinton Global Initiative, executives in national treasuries, and have ties to think tank groups that lobby for the MIC such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_for_a_New_American_Security">Center for a New American Security</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Monetary_Fund">IMF</a>,  and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Bank">World Bank.</a></p>

<p>These groups exist to ensure the rich stay rich by implementing international and national policy to implement scripts assisted by mainstream media (most of our MSM top executives are members of the Council on Foreign Relations, or the Trilateral Comission) </p>

<p>So you have direct ties into the banks of nations, control of the media, lobbyist groups with ties directly into the Pentagon / MIC. On top of that you have false flags, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JHFDzxkFWw">&quot;humanitarian missions&quot;</a> (USAID) that seed violence and discord to keep poor areas poor - see Latin American and Africa.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Federal reserve- Board of Governors -appointed by Pres.</p>

<p>But consider that the deep state has its leaders who manipulate who becomes president.  Usually they choose the options for us, for example, in 2016 it was planned to be J Bush and Clinton, both well positioned to be malleable presidents who would do their bidding just like Obama did.</p>

<p>They use their budget and their Wall Street buddies&#39; money to simply bribe congress, or find some dirt on them and blackmail.</p>

<p>It&#39;s pretty simple if you think about it.  There has to be one or two people that are making the decisions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No problem and yes, they hide in plain view. Blaming Jews works in both the Khazars and Rome&#39;s favor. Keeps light off of them. If Roman banking schemes fail then they can just throw the Jews under the bus, even though they (Khazar bankers) are not Jews ethnically or religiously. Kind of like &quot;Republican in name only&quot;. </p>

<p>I mean it&#39;s blatanly obvious once you look deeper. Real Jews in Israel protest the Zionist State of Israel. That should be a huge red flag for people to start looking deeper into this. The biggest problem that I see is that people who are looking for the truth fail to dig as deep as they can into actual history. The root system for a tree is far larger than the trees height. </p>
