<p><a href="https://youtu.be/yv74LqiumXE">https://youtu.be/yv74LqiumXE</a></p>

<p>Black people: inspiring film that shows how they have overcome the tyrannical oppression of whites.</p>

<p>White people: A film that places further blame on them for ruining the lives of blacks, responsible for their hardships. </p>

<p>Now, look at these screenshots of the fucking comments I took...</p>

<p><a href="https://postimg.org/image/m9b10mg4v/">https://postimg.org/image/m9b10mg4v/</a></p>

<p>This is despicable folks. We are so much better than this. I refuse to believe our species is this easily manipulatable, and that it HAS to be bots or shills upvoting these Facebook comments. They WANT us at each other&#39;s throats before the enact the economic implosion on us. </p>

<p>Remember, the one thing they truly fear, is a united, unified population, with a common goal of defeating them. </p>

<p>Spread peace my friends. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem with most of these movies that are &quot;based on history or a true story&quot; is that they are  not really actual historical facts. They have been rewriting history for many, many, many years now. </p>

<p>Do you want to know some potential actual history about &quot;African Americans&quot;? They very well may never even had ancestors from Africa like MS academia says. You know, taken from the Africa jungles, sold, and brought over on ships. There is evidence and theories that hundreds of thousands if not millions of those &quot;slaves&quot; were actually aborigines to North, Central, and South America along with the Caribbean.</p>

<p>There is also evidence that they are furthering this by lying about the ancestry via DNA tests like Ancestry.com and the likes. Imagine if Black people knew that their relatives never came from African jungles?</p>

<p>Yes, it does matter because it&#39;s your history/ancestry. Also, the first slaves in the US were poor Whites of various ethnicities. Furthermore with a historical fact, the first Black slaveowner was himself a Black man. </p>

<p>My point is, we (poor people) all got dealt a shitty hand throughout history. The word slave actually comes from the word Slav (Slavic). Wrongfully and ignorantly dwelling on the past does more harm than good for all of us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This film, the Tupac movie, NWA film that featured police brutality, and shows like &quot;Dear white people&quot; on Netflix? There is a clear motive behind the creation of these films and productions. </p>

<p>I think you honestly believe this film is simply a legitimate and honest contribution from a director/screenwriter. However, there are clear themes of division and hostility planted in this film. </p>

<p>If this film came out ten years ago, I wouldn&#39;t have a problem with it. But it&#39;s the TIMING of this &quot;divide and conquer&quot; agenda the elite are orchestrating that made me a little skeptical. Something is at play here, Hollywood is helping feed this divide and conquer wire narrative. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you take all of the slaves on earth <em>right now</em>, there are more of them then all of human history before these current slaves were born.</p>

<p>When the USA was formed July 4th 1787, more then 50% of the citizens were slaves or related to slaves. IN order to come to the colonies, you were either enslaved. British convicts were sent to the colonies, and became indentured servants after their sentence ended, and these ofc were mostly Scots, Irish, Welsh, and English, and captured foreign soldiers.</p>

<p>When the population of the slaves and indentured serfs became too high, the convict were then shipped off to Australia. It was only after this program that Spanish ships were bringing in mulattoes and Carib indians once white began to breed at a pace that there were no more white slaves. Most slaves who were born outside the western hemisphere were shipped and sold in Jamaica Cuba Puerto Rico Bermuda Bahamas/Bimini Brazil Suriname Guyana and what became Honduras/Guatemala, and their offspring were born into slavery, unlike the white slaves sold in Boston and Providence who were eventually released.</p>

<p>If a slave in the US didn&#39;t speak English, then they were captured and sold at auction by the Dutch, Arab/Moorish slavers or Trans-Africans, many were captured at sea, press-ganged/Shanghai&#39;d or transported back into a foreign African country.</p>

<p>The end result is that nearly 99% of black slaves in the US were captured by citizens or inhabitants of Africa or the Dutch.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Im not saying <em>you</em> are, I am referring to the general reaction towards these things. Also every year since roots they have made a &quot;black sports team overcomes racism&quot; and &quot;white teacher goes to the hood, good grades ensue&quot; movie. </p>

<p>There is most definitely outside forces dividing you, but they have been manipulating you for a very long time. You are witnessing people getting triggered over a movie and blaming the movie, I am saying the movie is simply cashing in on the current climate, which has been molded by people like George Soros who is funding both sides of the race war. </p>

<p>Im saying dont blame Hollywood for cashing in off the controversy generated by the masses getting triggered, they have been doing that since the dawn of film, ask yourself how you got to be triggered by a fuckin movie. </p>

<p>This racism continues today.</p>

<p>The Whites have lots of reasons to be afraid of the Blacks and to want to move to the suburbs to get away from them.</p>

<p>And yes there are a lot of bots and shills online. If you look at some Israeli-Palestinian videos, you&#39;ll see a lot of shills pretending to be Palestinian while worshipping Netenyahu and if you look at the profile, it is crystal clear it is a fake account.</p>

That&#39;s how you track how much was potentially made if you want to do all that math. I wouldn&#39;t care if it was seven families that got rich off of it.
