    <div class="md"><p>The Trillion Dollar boondoggle they were lobbing for was going to have a negligible impact on human production of CO2 and environmental impact. It was set to reduce emissions by 0.x% which would be offset by increasing production in countries that didn&#39;t sign.</p>

<p>It makes no logical sense whatsoever. Global Warming is real, in that its been warming since the last Ice Age. Man&#39;s impact is a hoax. Efforts to &quot;curb emissions&quot; are geo-political and business/oligarchy related.</p>

<p>In the 80s/90s the US/Canada banned the majority of chemical production via regulations. It then went to China and increased exponentially. One might argue its better the West is less toxic but overall it did not decrease. So either you are a &quot;racist&quot; that is fine with offshoring pollution and descriptive processing/production or you care about the world and realize anything touched by Politicians is completely useless.</p>

<p>Science is <em>observation</em> and <strong>experiment</strong> and without being able to prove your models with experimentation one cannot <strong>know</strong> anything. Their models are inaccurate and do not work.</p>

If someone is claiming they are correct in their theories when it doesn&#39;t match observational data they are not scientists they are shills.</p>

<p>It&#39;s very simple. A 10 year old, when informed about the evidence for a previous Ice Age can determine its getting warmer. Any predictive model that says &quot;it&#39;s warming&quot; is correct in that its warming. To prove CO2 you would have to use <strong>all</strong> the data they claim is causing the warming which they did and the climate models are WRONG.</p>

<p>That&#39;s because the chart is over the course of thousands of years and we haven&#39;t gone near the peak levels. </p>

<p>The estimates need to be looked at over long periods because any cross section would make it appear like a runaway reaction. <a href="https://wattsupwiththat.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/co2_temperature_historical.png">Earth is believed to be millions of years old after all</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>And you&#39;re claiming there&#39;s no relationship for CO2, while providing a graph that shows it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Temperature precedes CO2 rise. The causality can then be interpreted as increased temperature creates CO2. Impossible for backwards causality [without some underlying alternative mechanism - which is possible but not what is promoted].</p>

<p>You will notice they stopped promoting and publishing <a href="http://www.randombio.com/antarctic-ice-core-data.png">charts like these</a> and now stick with <a href="https://static.skepticalscience.com/images/co2_temp_1900_2008.gif">averaged CO2 lines</a> because it was painfully obvious for most people who can read data.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The subsections of the temperature chart are for 50k years, with the exception of the last looking at 20k years. It is not difficult to visualize a comparison of half of any of the 50k subsections in approximation to the final subsection. The impact is telling.</p>

<p>Again, you are reading the graph backwards. The X axis is going from past to present. So when reading left to right, if the temperature spikes and then CO2 spikes, it means the CO2 spike preceded the temperature spike.</p>

<p>Absolutely false. In your own words.</p>

<p>It&#39;s also admitted yet claimed it doesn&#39;t contradict the model.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The lag proves that rising CO2 did not cause the initial warming as past ice ages ended, but it does not in any way contradict the idea that higher CO2 levels cause warming. <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn11659-climate-myths-ice-cores-show-co2-increases-lag-behind-temperature-rises-disproving-the-link-to-global-warming/">link</a></p>

<p>It of course fully contradicts the model. The entire claim is that CO2 increases temperature but if temperature increase <strong>precedes</strong> CO2 rise its a non argument. Correlation is not causation.</p>

<p>I actively seek out counter evidence to what I believe, so that I can remain objective.  It&#39;s a particular human failing that we all share and is worsened by the emotional involvement.</p>

<p>So, push against confirmation bias.  You may come out even more convinced that you&#39;re right, and you may find that one question which will lead you to better answers.</p>

<p>Remember, you&#39;ve believed in lots of things over your lifetime that turned out to be wrong.  We all have.</p>

<p>Just like the tobacco industry muddied the water with cancer research, the coal, oil, and gas industry is doing the same with climate science. For every year we delay the transition to clean energy, they make more money. </p>

<p>Absolutely false. In your own words.</p>

<p>It&#39;s also admitted yet claimed it doesn&#39;t contradict the model.</p>

<p>The lag proves that rising CO2 did not cause the initial warming as past ice ages ended, but it does not in any way contradict the idea that higher CO2 levels cause warming. <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn11659-climate-myths-ice-cores-show-co2-increases-lag-behind-temperature-rises-disproving-the-link-to-global-warming/">link</a></p>

<p>It of course fully contradicts the model. The entire claim is that CO2 increases temperature but if temperature increase <strong>precedes</strong> CO2 rise its a non argument. Correlation is not causation.</p>
