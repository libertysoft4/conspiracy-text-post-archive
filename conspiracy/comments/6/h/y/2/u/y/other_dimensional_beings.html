    <div class="md"><p>Ok, so I&#39;ve encountered demonic beings in my life and seen them with my own two eyes and the moment I mentioned Jesus Christ, they went away.  The bible tells us to have spiritual discernment and to test all spirits to see if they uphold sound doctrine from God.  The fact that these demonic beings fled away when I mentioned Jesus Christ, proved that Jesus Christ word is true.  I suggest that you test the spirits that you encounter, by mentioning Jesus Christ.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The beings that I&#39;ve seen was a red demonic face and a dark demonic shadow being and I saw these beings manifest in reality, not in a dream and only Jesus was able to cast these beings away, but only because I truly believe in Jesus Christ and I have faith in that He can help me.</p>

<p>Now the reason these beings may have not fled, was because you may not truly believe in Jesus Christ, I suggest that pray to Jesus Christ before you go to bed, but you have to sincerely seek Jesus Christ and Jesus knows your heart and He will know if you&#39;re sincerely seeking Him.</p>

<p>Praying before you go to sleep is a good way to have the protection of Jesus Christ as you sleep.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The demons/unclean spirits fled, because Jesus has authority over demons and the demons must leave.</p>

<p>Luke 11:20 - But if I with the finger of God cast out devils, no doubt the kingdom of God is come upon you.</p>

<p>There&#39;s no people hell right now, nobody will be going there until the end of times have passed and then everybody will be judged on the day of Judgement, those who died in unrighteousness without Jesus Christ, will be thrown into the lake of fire. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>God judges us by His perfect standard, God is without sin, so we must be judged by God&#39;s perfect sinless standard.  It only takes one sin to be condemned to hell and to be honest I deserve hell for my sins, but thank God I can receive mercy through Jesus Christ.  Don&#39;t worry about the people who are already dead and are condemned to hell, worry about how you can gain salvation through Jesus Christ.  Remember we cannot achieve getting to heaven on our own accord, but we must receive mercy from God to be saved from hell.  God requires us to be dependent on Him for mercy, therefore no person can earn their way to everlasting life, but instead it is a gift from God.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re missing the main message, which is that you can be saved through Jesus Christ, sadly there&#39;s going to be more people going to hell rather than receiving eternal life and living on the new earth with Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>Revelation 21:1- Then I saw &quot;a new heaven and a new earth,&quot; for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away, and there was no longer any sea.</p>

<p>What is your belief about what happens after you die?  Because from what I can see is that you try to contact spirits without any spiritual discernment, which makes you vulnerable to be deceived by demons and unclean spirits and remember I already have my experience with unclean spirits and they have fled when I evoked Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>Based on what evidence? If I&#39;m being deceived, then God is intentionally deceiving me. He is intentionally trying to send me to hell. He would be the one that created the demon that planted the dream in my head. And what do I think happens when you die? We transcend to a dimension of love and light. My brain cannot physically conceptualize a higher dimension as it is not possible. I&#39;m guessing heaven for you is a bunch of shiny gold mansions? I&#39;ll ask again, is there sin in heaven?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So jealously and pride can exist in heaven? So once all the humans transform into angels, there&#39;s a high chance that one of the 2 billion will be the next lucifer. Unless God is going to magically make sin not exist in heaven this time. Why not just not create Lucifer? God created this mess. And plenty of reasons. God/Yahweh is literally a maniac in the Bible. Yahweh is God of the jews. The jews think of you as cattle. Everything you know is a lie. I think Satan or &quot;the red dragon&quot; is a reptilian. I think Yahweh and Satan are reptilians. I&#39;m still debating whether or not Jesus is a reptilian. I am definitely sure Jesus&#39; message was twisted by reptilians. I think Jesus might&#39;ve come to show us christ consciousness, which means being connected to source. I know it&#39;s a satanic doctrine, but hey, maybe that&#39;s what satan wants you to believe. Or should I say Yaldabaoth. I believe I&#39;ve seen Satan/Yaldabaoth himself in my dream. The Vatican is in control of the world. If you don&#39;t think the pope is evil then you&#39;re being deceived. Vatican means fore-tellers. They are writing the script, or scripture. Everything is already set in stone. They are not prophesying, they already know what&#39;s going to happen. Armageddon is a reptilian plan to wipe out humanity. Draco reptilians have invaded this earth and installed their Draconian system of rule. That&#39;s why this planet is so fucked up. I think Christos-Sophia is the final piece of the puzzle. Sophia is the Goddess of wisdom, I believe I&#39;ve met her in a dream. Maybe I&#39;m being deceived, but I believe I got a confirmation that it was real. The story goes that this whole universe was created when Sophia &quot;fell&quot; from heaven. You can think of this universe as being inside the head of Sophia. She desired to create without the her divine masculine counterpart. In doing this, she created this dream world we live in. She also created Yaldabaoth through her fall. Yaldabaoth thought that he was the only God. He is a jealous god, and envious god, a murderer. He demands worship. He gets power through worship. I believe 144,000 divine souls came to Earth to teach christ consciousness to save sophia. We are sophia. We are the bride of christ. Christ and sophia are &quot;married&quot; in &quot;heaven&quot;. So maybe christ was a real figure, in fact he most likely was. But would he have taught about hell? I personally don&#39;t think so. Was he crucified for his teachings? Maybe, but I don&#39;t think it was because God demanded that he be crucified. A guy named Jeffrey Daughtery was a protestant minister for 20+ years. He has over 100,00 hours of biblical study. 10,000 hours is considered to be expert level. He now goes by the name of the christian whistleblower. He now believes that Yahweh is a reptilian and that he is planning a false flag UFO invasion. He didn&#39;t teach my about reptilians, I taught myself. But as time progresses, more and more people are talking about reptilians. Look back in history, plenty of human civilizations talk about reptilians. I think reptilians have ruled this planet for a long long time, and it&#39;s not until now that people are finally getting off their knees and standing up, and connecting to their true divine source. I&#39;ll ask you this, what do you look like when you pray? On your knees, head bowed down, hands together like you have on shackles. Like a slave. I feel more free than I ever have. I feel truly connected to my source. I am not afraid of anything. I only have love in my heart. When you &quot;pray&quot; you are only telling God that you don&#39;t approve of his divine plan. The true Gods, the inexpressible ones, do not require nor want worship. I don&#39;t expect you to believe a word I say, but just know that you don&#39;t have to live in the cage inside your head. Christianity, Islam, and Judaism are the work of reptilians, in my humble opinion. All I can say is get off your knees and stand up</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow, you have an incredible imagination because you&#39;re making some very outrageous farfetched claims, so are you some sort of prophet?  How do you know what you believe is true?  How are you testing the spirits you encounter to see if they&#39;re good or evil and by what standard are you judging them?</p>

<p>What you speak of exactly matches these bible verses.
1 Timothy 4:1-2 The Spirit clearly says that in later times some will abandon the faith and follow deceiving spirits and things taught by demons.</p>

<p>2.)  influenced by the hypocrisy of liars, whose consciences are seared with a hot iron</p>

    <div class="md"><p>More far-fetched than talking donkeys and Saul demanding 100 foreskins? How do I know what I believe is true? I don&#39;t. Trust me, I was a christian just like you. Now I&#39;m free. Christianity is a virus. I&#39;ve read everything you&#39;ve typed, and out of respect, I ask that you read this <a href="http://www.alternet.org/12-craziest-most-awful-things-god-did-old-testament">http://www.alternet.org/12-craziest-most-awful-things-god-did-old-testament</a></p>

<p>Some parts honest to god made me laugh so hard. It&#39;s okay to doubt God, it&#39;s okay to question God, and it&#39;s more than okay to deny Yahweh and worship your source God. You will only find unconditional love from source. I can promise you that. The best news of all is that Yaldabaoth is not going to win. Not on my watch. Please watch this music video. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKopy74weus">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKopy74weus</a> I think I am one of the 144,000.

    <div class="md"><p>Everything you&#39;ve mentioned just perverted everything the bible says and called God a reptilian.  You&#39;re on a different level of deception and you have no spiritual discernment, because your foundation is not based on the truth of Jesus Christ, with Jesus Christ I have stability and clarity and no confusion. </p>

<p>Everything you believe is demonic and you should ask the question as to why whatever you believe in is so hell bent on perverting the Christianity, maybe because they&#39;re trying to divert you away from the Truth of Jesus Christ..</p>

<p>You have absolutely no spiritual discernment and you&#39;ve taken heed to the doctrine of unclean spirits.  Your foundation of belief is based on lies.</p>

<p>Jesus is my salvation, but your system leads to no clarity and is full of confusion and is unstable.</p>

<p>Yes we can keep in contact, whenever you want to talk, I&#39;ll be here for you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jesus taught that we were all a part of God-Source. We are all connected. He was one of many ascended beings - a non-terrestrial soul. You are able to cast out Archons, by invoking his name because he is of the Light. You could also do the same by calling Archangels or other ascended beings.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t expect to sway your opinion though. I&#39;m a big Jesus fan... there&#39;s just much more to the story. The Church (via Rome) is a Luciferian organization.</p>
