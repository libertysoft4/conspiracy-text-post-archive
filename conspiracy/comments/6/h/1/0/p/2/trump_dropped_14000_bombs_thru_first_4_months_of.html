<p>Maybe US military bases on foreign soil are <strong>fiefdoms</strong> for the host country&#39;s politicians and WAR, INC. (USA)--infrastructure projects, weapons systems, training/clothing/food for soldiers and mercenaries (etc.)</p>

<p>Edit: Here&#39;s a short documentary about the [<strong>children in Mosul</strong>] who are far too often caught under the US-led coalition dropping bombs in Iraq (please watch and consider them!!!)...I&#39;m going out for lunch with friends and will not be returning until later (hate it when friends check phones while visiting)</p>

<p>Im sure you, like myself, know President Trump will go down as the one of the best presidents in hisotry, second to only George Washington no doubt. But we must continue to spread the word, spread the truth about President Trump, and keep on spreading the truth about Traitor Obama. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, ok. So he asked for the prize?</p>

<p>How is he a hypocrite when someone else gave him a prize he didn&#39;t ask to have. Thing is, bush was so damn bad (conservative - just like the mullahs in the middle east) that the world felt relieved to have a decent man in the whitehouse for a change. </p>

<p>I would give hitler the peace prize after bush (and I voted for him once)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s hypocritical to not imbue the qualities one should possess if considered for the award. Shame on him and on the ones who selected him. Similar to how Saudi Arabia was awarded for Women&#39;s Rights. Bottom line is he campaigned on undoing all of the largely neoconservative practices such as the torture program, drone program, and Guantanamo Bay. Those are the reasons he was considered for the award. He continued and expanded the functions of those programs rather than fulfilling the promises that won him the award. He was no different than Bush in his policy towards the middle east in general. </p>

<p>Comparing someone to Hitler doesn&#39;t necessarily help any argument. Again, falls in line with your comments being sensationalist and deliberately emotional and misleading. </p>
