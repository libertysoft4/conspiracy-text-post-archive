    <div class="md"><p>A true left winger doesn&#39;t believe in nation states or governments. What&#39;s called the left these days is still corporate fascism with better marketing.</p>

<p>The best example of this is the EU which gets called left wing (open boarders etc etc) but the EU also prints €10bn a month to buy private corporate debt whilst at the same time enforce harsh austerity on greek pensioners. This is not left wing.</p>

<p>The arguement played out as right v left in the media is a divide and rule tactic. They make you argue between right and left whilst the bankers run off with all the money.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, coming at this from what you assume the left believe may not be the most productive way to get answers to your questions. There&#39;s lots of implicit assumptions in there that I believe a majority of liberals and leftists would disagree with. The good news is that it doesn&#39;t make sense to you because it&#39;s not the argument we&#39;re making. Outlets like CNN mislead people, but conservative information sources do the same, you know? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>So we can either take what the left debates at face value and just dismiss their policies to democrats being extremely moral and caring people or we can look at the bigger picture. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You will never learn anything if you don&#39;t listen to your opponents. I know we&#39;re on the conspiracy sub atm, but seriously, we&#39;re not out to get you any more than the conservatives are. We disagree with you politically. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Welfare, food stamps, sanctuary cities, Healthcare, free education- we are incentivizing millions of unskilled and non english speaking people to come flooding in our door step. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Most liberals I know do not want open borders and immigration. We do want to take care of the people already here. The far left believes that borders are an arbitrary fence designed to keep populations static and docile. They would rather allow open travel between nations, or a redefinition of what a nation even is. Sure, people could move here, but you&#39;d also be free to leave for anywhere else. This would require global cooperation and will not happen anytime soon, so it means almost nothing. But there you go. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Who does communism sound like a good deal to? The poor.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nearly half of our children are <a href="https://www.mailman.columbia.edu/public-health-now/news/nearly-half-american-children-living-near-poverty-line">poor</a>. The numbers will only get worse, given current trends. And again, most liberals do not want full-blown communism. We want a society that doesn&#39;t raise half its children near the poverty line. Poverty leads to crime and wasted potential, making our current wealth inequality an incredibly inefficient and costly system. We view welfare as the means by which everyone can start life with reasonable opportunities and security, as well as a crime-deterrent. Morality doesn&#39;t need to factor into it.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Who would even enlist in an army with a government who backs sanctuary cities? How could you ask someone to put their life on the line for... whoever the hell feels entitled to defense from any corner of the earth.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t think anyone enlists today for some random guy three states over. They enlist to protect their friends and families. I don&#39;t see how this would change anything, even if it was an accurate representation of leftist views. </p>
