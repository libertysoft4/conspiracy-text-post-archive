        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>What is it really that you want this sub to be?</p>

<p>What is the golden age of Conspiracy?</p>

<p>Why can&#39;t we spend less time poisoning wells, back biting, shill calling, and whining?</p>

<p>Have you seen the upvotes on the front page now, we are lucky to have ones over 1k anymore. (maybe the mods could weigh in on that one, maybe it is constant downvotes and upvotes. I don&#39;t know). It seems like the sub is slowly starting to shred itself by the seams because we can&#39;t agree on what conspiracy theory is important or not.</p>

<p>I thought of a possible idea, but it might not work. Has Conspiracy tried [serious] tags? </p>

<p>Could we have open debate threads and then ones focused on digging new information? That way we can discuss and bitch at each other, while allowing the old Greybush members to keep researching and enjoying the sub too.</p>

<p>I&#39;m just spitballing, but I&#39;d welcome any additional ideas or thoughts.</p>

<p>Edit: I feel like I should say that I recognize the names here, and you guys regardless of which conspiracy you&#39;re behind, you&#39;ve always been straight forward with your beliefs and provide good content to debate. Thank you all for being skeptical. :)</p>

<p>I&#39;ll admit I&#39;m not innocent, one of the thing&#39;s that got me hooked on this sub was the fact it isn&#39;t some overly sensitive safe-space for a certain community,  but I also try to intelligently explain my argument or view and provide sources to support my side, I don&#39;t just go into a post and say &quot;this is dumb, your dumb, and everyone that agrees with you is dumb&quot; that is the shit mods should be getting out of here.</p>

<p>Sometimes that shit is incredibly low effort though and deserves to be called out. Which it usually is, and it is necessary to show that the content is low effort. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s an example I saw a few minutes ago:
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6hk747/gops_defense_of_trump_reaches_new_low_ignorance/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6hk747/gops_defense_of_trump_reaches_new_low_ignorance/</a></p>

<p>Notice how the entire comment section is basically about people fucking dolphins? Wtf is that? Maybe those people should start their own post about how much they want to fuck dolphins instead of derailing that post?</p>

<p>Besides dolphin sex, whole view of derailing  is basically people posting about trump and the army of <em>&quot;but what about Hillary and pizzagate?!?&quot;</em> users derailing conversation...... or post about Clinton with the waves of <em>&quot;but she isn&#39;t even relevant anymore, so why don&#39;t you want to talk about trump&quot;</em> </p>

<p>If the people in the trump post would rather talk about Clinton, they should go find a Clinton post, there are a ton of them, and if the people in the Clinton post would rather talk about trump, they should go find a trump post, there are a ton of them, again I&#39;m not anti dissent, you can argue the other side in any post but it&#39;s obvious when that isn&#39;t the intent.... </p>

<p>I 100% agree with this, and I think the mods can do a better job weeding out the propaganda from both sides that don&#39;t comment or provide sources in their own post they just post links and twitter comments all day..... I honestly wouldn&#39;t mind an automod that can give a designated amount of time to the op to provide either a deeper explanation of why or what they&#39;re posting, if they don&#39;t get an answer in say idk 1 hour, the post can be auto deletes because it&#39;s clear he op doesn&#39;t actually give a shit </p>
