<p>Think about your strategic situation and you&#39;ll come up with a lot more ideas than the things that are being currently implemented. 95% of your shills are not the least bit sophisticated.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The way I see it, it&#39;s either:<br/>
A) censor the shills - but defining and singling out shills is difficult, risks banning genuine people, and goes again the very idea the sub was made on of info free from censorship.<br/>
B) leave the shills - but that way it may go to shit unless the genuine users are good enough to organically prevent them from gaining any real footing in the sub. But that leads me onto this thought.<br/>
How do you ensure the users are &quot;good enough&quot;, or equipped with the right tools, techniques, and knowledge to best allow them to stay on top of the shill/troll problem? You gotta educate. Education seems to be the only obvious long term solution. Educate the users on what the shills and trolls&#39; goals are, their tools and techniques, and how best to counter them. Teach them to calmly explain their perspective, downvote, report (if necessary), and move on instead of engaging and being dragged down to an argument started by some ad homenim attack or whatever.<br/>
This requires being able to compile comprehensive lists and materials, and putting them in one, easy, obvious place for everyone to see. Like a sticky post. It&#39;s possible. It would take serious prep to make it air-tight, but without putting in the hard work you can&#39;t get the pay off. Then once it&#39;s out there it&#39;s down to the users to exercise and practice it. Which I believe they could do so, effectively. </p>

<p>The main problem with shills is they drive off your organic user base, which is disappearing at an alarming rate while you wring your hands and repeat shibboleths about how &quot;censorship&quot; is bad.</p>

<p>Gee, I wonder how users could have gotten brainwashed when the vote bots control your comment section for months at a time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I used to think the rallying cry posts were ways that some groups of people, not just shills but including groups from /pol/ and such, were using to make a roll call.  They post a vague &quot;I&#39;m with you OP&quot; to sound off, then go through and see who else posted before going through their history and upvoting them/coming to their defense elsewhere.

    <div class="md"><p>I haven&#39;t seen a single one of these meta-super-concerned-troll posts, that came from someone who actually contributes anything.  It&#39;s almost always some outside voice, or a person who claims to be a lurker, but doesn&#39;t do anything here.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not pro censorship in any case, but I think this version of concern trolling could fall under rule 10 pretty easily, with <em>maybe</em> a clarification or mention of this specific issue.  Banning these posts, and repeat offenders, wouldn&#39;t reduce content or discussion in the slightest.  It would even take away one technique of forum sliding, for when we&#39;re really heavily invaded by shills, r/all normies, and such.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Checking in.  I contribute here pretty often.  OP&#39;d the current text meta-post in suspect.  Truly concerned and frustrated by the apparent social engineering on this sub recently.  That caused me to post my thoughts and frustrations but I expected it to be downvoted into oblivion.  It seems to have struck a nerve (my inbox is toxic).  Didn&#39;t mean to wreck havoc just wanted to present (what I thought were) valid concerns.  It&#39;s happening whether you like it or not.  Meta posts keep it in the light.  I get these posts are annoying so it&#39;s right to voice concern on your part too.   But not allowing people to point it out is probably not the right move either.  </p>

<p>What is strange is the pure unadulterated hate from so many people who hate someone for saying they won&#39;t accept the narrative. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not just about your post, as far as I can tell.  I was referring to the &quot;original&quot; concern troll posts more than the ones just reacting to them.</p>

<p>It&#39;s particularly bad when we&#39;re in the middle of a brigade.  We get <em>X</em> number of posts whining about how we&#39;re just t_d2, then we get <em>Y</em> number of posts trying to claim that were <em>not</em> t_d2, and pretty soon, we end up with a front page filled with people trying to claim what this sub is or isn&#39;t about.  It&#39;s just a self perpetuating circle of silliness.</p>

<p>Maybe the mods have bigger fish to fry than this particular issue, though.  I think these concern posts could be disposed of pretty easily, and it dovetails into a rework of rule 10, which is pretty vague and unenforceable, as is.  Either way, it&#39;s not the end of he world, just obnoxiousness that interferes with actual discussion of conspiracies.</p>
