        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Its no secret that we have been constantly been fed lies about our health and foods and USA today , BBC, and numerous other sites are now spreading a new one.</p>

<p>Let me summarize their argument, &quot;fats = bad&quot; &quot;low fat foods = weight loss.&quot; Since a study showed that Coconut Oil didn&#39;t effect weight loss (determined by dozens of factors so judging by a single food is nonsensical) suddenly MSM is deeming it &quot;not healthy.&quot; </p>

<p>Not to mention the fact that the AHA where the study came from has been been connected to corporations with vested interest in selling things like &quot;low fat&quot; or &quot;sugar free&quot; versions of there food while adding more sodium and other harmful chemicals.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/the-heart-associations-junk-science-diet&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj1lPLdpsPUAhVBOD4KHS7_BUEQFgggMAE&amp;usg=AFQjCNGFnkjqF5TIYlzTJbhWu6eqZaVwQw&amp;sig2=F6cRouH__UILSrWjd1g44A">A</a> and <a href="http://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/4398304">B</a></p>

<p>Coconut oil may be 100% fat but it is healthy fats that our body needs including MCTs. The fact that they are recommending people eat Vegetable Oils including​ Corn oil (one of the U.S. largest industries at $2.6 Billion) is saddening.</p>

<p>People always talk about big pharma on this sub but the food industry is just as corrupt with disinformation about our health constantly spread on the news, tv, stores.</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t know about Dr. Terry Whals I suggest you youtube her and the foundmyfitness channel - Dr. Rhonda Patrick.</p>

<p>She used diet to reverse severe symptoms of MS (she couldn&#39;t walk while using chemo/MS drugs to stop the immune system attacking her brain...the drugs didn&#39;t work) After years of work she figured out a great diet and it&#39;s coconut oil based/coconut oil friendly</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Chemo most likely helped more than the oil. MS, although a cause is unknown many scientists and pathologists believe it stems from latent re-infections or infections that supress the immune system. Specifically, OSPA fungal shedders like Lyme disease better known as Borrelia Burgdorderi. Lyme according to the CDC is hard to catch and easy to treat. Except that none of that is true and it is an epedemic in the US and around the world and persists even after antibiotics re-sproting latetn infections and increasing bacteria and viral load. This supresses the immune response for some time and then makes a come back going on a tear where nuclear antibodies attack our cells and recepters leading to many MS, ALS, Parkinsons disease like symptoms. </p>

<hr/>

<p>Why did chemo work. I bet it was because is erradicated latent infections as well as mutate b-cells that probably also added to symptoms. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They aren&#39;t completely sure why chemo sometimes works.  I&#39;m not an expert by any means.  I&#39;m just someone who has MS and likes to research.  Chemo is an anti-inflammatory.  MS causes inflammation.  As a result, if there is less inflammation there are less symptoms.  </p>

<p>As far as long term results, here&#39;s my best guess:
MS is driven by B and T cells.  They get killed off with everything else in the bloodstream.  With the mature cells not there to influence the new cells, it&#39;s possible for the new ones to grow back differently and thus change to a milder form of the disease.  Like I said, that&#39;s my guess.  I&#39;m not sure how right it is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Chemo can wipe out mutated cells and infections but it destroys good cells as well. The lauric acid and MTCs probably helped though too. That&#39;s a good guess and I think B-cell mutations can most definitely stem from OSPA shedders like B. Burgdorferi and the TLR2 agonist properties. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I read an interesting book called bulletproof that alleges that cheapo coffee has mold in it. He claims that the reason coffee studies are all over the board is because of lack of quality control of the coffee being used. When you think about it, it kind of makes sense. Coffee beans are not beans, they are dried berries. And we all know how easily berries mold. </p>

<p>Anyway, that said, there are studies on every subject that directly conflict with one another. The secret to figuring out which study to believe is to see who paid for it. I also firmly believe the AMA deliberately gives us bad nutritional advice to ensure we develop chronic illnesses that keep us customers for life.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hydrogenated oils are full of trans-fats. Coconut oil can and often is hydrogenated. Hydrogenated oils have a longer shelf life, hence the popularity in packaged foods.</p>

<p>Coconut oil comes in lots of forms. Coconut oil can withstand high heat, so refined is not much different than virgin.</p>

<p>Lower the heat tolerance of an oil, the more important virgin is. Olive oil does not tolerate heat well and should not be used for cooking as it oxidizes in the heat.</p>

<p>&quot;Vegetable oils&quot; are made from the seeds. These are not &quot;natural&quot; foods that our bodies evolved with over time; they were invented a little over 100 years ago. They are high in polyunsaturated fats, which our bodies don&#39;t process well. Our bodies have a hard time eliminating them and store them as fats. The obesity epidemic is pretty closely tied to the rise in vegetable oil consumption. </p>

<p>Not true. Hydrogenation of unsaturated fats to become trans fats is vastly vastly different than slow cooking beans in hot water.</p>

<p>I guarantee you if you ate a handful of sunflower seeds every day you would have nothing but benefit.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.stylecraze.com/articles/benefits-of-sunflower-seeds-for-skin-hair-and-health/">http://www.stylecraze.com/articles/benefits-of-sunflower-seeds-for-skin-hair-and-health/</a></p>

<p>Poly unsaturated fats are not dangerous. Hydrogenated fats are. </p>

<p>I guarantee you, if you did an equivalency test you would find that people who hate seeds vs people who ate the equivalent amount of refined oil, there would be drastically different outcomes in health.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re interested in doing the experiment... </p>

<p>2,500g of seeds makes 1,000ml of oil.</p>

<p>That&#39;s 2.5g/ml or 37.5g of seeds per tablespoon oil. </p>

<p>A tablespoon of seeds is about 9g. So 7 tablespoons of seed = 1 tablespoon of oil.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s just like you said in your comment. Coconut oil is anti-fungal. Athlete&#39;s Foot is a fungus!  :-)</p>

<p>Now this might get a little personal, but worth mentioning. Coconut Oil is great to use as a lubricant during sexual intercourse too. Especially beneficial to the woman. Some women are prone to developing Urinary Tract Infections (Bladder Infections). By using Coconut Oil as a lubricant during sex, it helps prevent the development of a UTI.  :-)</p>

<p>Coconut Oil is great!</p>

<p>I have heard from an acquaintance well learned in chemistry that due to the molecular structure of marg. it is hard to eliminate from the body and can remain areas of the body that are hard to impossible for the body to rid it from.</p>

<p>You are conflating canola oil with different sources of fat. My original question was on the &quot;mind melting&quot; components of canola not margarine or &quot;low fat butter&quot; alternatives. </p>

<p>Where does it go? </p>

<p>Some other questions: 
* What is quantity of trans fat in canola oil? 
* At what temperature does canola oxidize as compared to other fats? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I&#39;ve thought of that conundrum re. fish fats/poly fats before too. </p>

<p>I believe fish and raw nut - walnut, hazel, pistachio, cashew etc...are OK as they can be processed by the body it&#39;s more processed and artificial poly fats like marg. where oils from these sources ma have been heated and or altered chemically.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know re the two questions about canola sorry. But it oxidizes more readily than many natural sat. fats I believe esp. compared to coconut fat/oil.</p>

<p>I believe canola oil is shit and &quot;mind melting&quot; for much the same reason as margarine and other &quot;low fat&quot; options are. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My dude spent 11 days in the hospital this month. 4 days in icu. I had to fight tooth and nail and ended up bringing him every single meal because they wanted to feed him super high carb meals as a newly diagnosed diabetic while trying to &quot;lower his sugar&quot; I had to have a chat with dietary and we got into a heated argument over keto and how they were perpetually giving him meals he should not eat in the interest of keeping his levels at the right place. Every nurse, doctor and staff member told me dietary is full of shit.  Yet I had to explain to nearly every single person what keto was and fucking eventually got to the point where staff stopped bringing him food entirely and yet were giving him fast acting insulin. It was hell getting in on time each morning to feed him, visit, leave, get lunch ready, come back, visit, get dinner ready and get back. Exhausting and not even the least of the problems we had. </p>

<p>This entire system is fucked. They don&#39;t have even a base knowledge of healthy food let alone be able to tell me why what they are feeding people is better.  Fuck the food guidelines and the fucks who push it.  </p>

<p>His sugar was within amazing levels when I got him off their meals finally. But oh the things I could say about the rest of his care. </p>

<p>&quot;Insulin will lower his sugar&quot; &quot; yeah, no shit, did you refuse to feed him and yet gave him his fast acting while he was at 134?&quot; &quot;Yes, the meal would have stressed him out&quot; &quot;fffffffuck this place&quot; then proceed to rage out as I run home to get him food before he drops too low.</p>

Completely cutting out any food, food group, or nutrient is IMO quite a bad idea for most people. It sets you up for failure and relapse.

<p>Are you sure you understand what <a href="/r/keto">/r/keto</a> is?  You don&#39;t completely cut out carbs, you drop to ~25g a day for a few weeks until your body undergoes ketosis fully and then you can eat up to 50g carbs a day and still have your body run on fat.  There are also plenty of low to zero carb alternatives to staple foods like bread, rice and pasta.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Sure in a ideal world this is optimal.  In the real world however people are already on terrible diets and eating poorly, largely centered around extremely high carb diets.  For those people, of which there are countless in the US, a <a href="/r/keto">/r/keto</a> diet is the easiest way to lose weight and get back to a healthy lifestyle.</p>

<p>If you are in good shape and active you don&#39;t need to go on a keto diet, not sure your point here.  No one is trying to convert the healthy, this is for those who need to lose weight.</p>

<p>I know literally no one who has been keto for more than a year or two. I&#39;m sure they&#39;re out there, <strong>but there&#39;s not many of them,</strong> and it is IMO not a long term solution for the vast, vast majority of people.</p>

<p>My anectdotes differ greatly from yours, I don&#39;t think either of us can say anything with any definitive certainty in this discussion at this point.

    <div class="md"><p>Best diet for weight loss is fasting. Humans have been using it for thousands of years. You can find it prescribed in almost every major religion. It costs nothing, just takes discipline.  But now the health industry tries to push this myth on you that your body is going to waste away and you&#39;ll lose all your muscle mass.  They want you to eat more, more often, and with their specific dietary guidelines and supplements. </p>

<p>Fasting has been proven to improve insulin sensitivity, burn more fat, and even increase metabolism for the first 3-5 days.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s not saying coconut oil is the devil, just that in using it for deep frying and so in is just as bad as other oils. </p>

<p>If you&#39;re eating a lot of fried food, regardless of the oil it&#39;s bad for you. </p>

<p>Using it in moderation is fine, don&#39;t eat spoonfuls of it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have watched a lot of videos from dr. McDougall and in my experience he is more right than anyone else regarding diet. Ive been working out a lot for the most of my life and when i decided to cut i followed the usuall low carb/high protein diets which are mostly meat/dairy and other animal products. Needless to say whenever i tried going on that diet i would experience flu like symptoms and even threw up regulary, had very low energy, and i generally felt like crap. The syptoms didnt go away, altho they did become milder, even after weeks on that diet. I tried many diets because of that and i felt like crap on most of them. Only after trying the mcdougall diet (based on rice) have i finally felt great and my performances skyrocketed. I dont like being a vegan but i just feel awful and slugish if go back to eating animal products. Now i eat meat only once a week.</p>

<p>Why this is relevant to the topic:</p>

<p>Basically mcdougall says that any fat that that is extracted from a plant and concentrated, like oil, is unhealthy. Oil should never be used for cooking or eating raw. All your requirements for fats are covered by eating whole foods on a diet based on starch. Humans are basically starchivores and our whole digestive system is built around starch. Starch is to humans what meat is to dogs. Every civilization in history survived and thriwed on starch. In europe it was wheath, asia rice obviously, north america corn and potato, south america potato and sweet potato, middle east wheat etc. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s a terrible diet.  If you don&#39;t have enough fat your body will just convert the extra protein into carbs.  Literally no point to going low carb if you&#39;re just replacing it with high protein.</p>

<p>If you want to go low carb you have to go high fat and medium protein.  Check out <a href="/r/keto">/r/keto</a> for more information, as well as helpful information like having chicken broth to combat any flu symptoms you may feel as your body goes through ketosis.</p>

<p>This McDougall guy honestly sounds like a fraud.  I let results speak for themselves, and <a href="/r/keto">/r/keto</a> has that in droves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There have been studies on coconut oil as early as 1955 that show it raises total cholesterol at nearly a 2.5 hdl/ldl ratio. If you knew that, would you still believe it cures cancer, obesity, ms, and chrons disease or is it still big scary gobernment science?</p>

<p>Olive oil is better especially if you have high cholesterol to begin with. Coconut oil with just 1 % cholesterol increased the occlusion of arteries as compared to the control group and the olive oil group. </p>

<p>But thats from 1955 before large corporations were burning down hectares of rain forest for coconut plantations for fat white housewives. </p>

<p>We were using palm oil at the time. 
Most now accept palm oil is not good. Coconut oil is probably not going to kill you, but if you are eating it by the spoonfull to lose weight or cure disease you are just demented. If you are a vegan you should probably eat it because you do need some saturated fat in your diet and your diet being plant based is going to be relatively low in cholesterol. But most Americans and most Europeans are not vegan. Excess saturated fat in those people is not good. Eating globs of fat is not going to make you lose weight unless you count shitting your guts out as a diet strategy and in that case why not usr milk of magnesium and give your liver and lymphatic system a break?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I read an interesting book called bulletproof that alleges that cheapo coffee has mold in it. He claims that the reason coffee studies are all over the board is because of lack of quality control of the coffee being used. When you think about it, it kind of makes sense. Coffee beans are not beans, they are dried berries. And we all know how easily berries mold. </p>

<p>Anyway, that said, there are studies on every subject that directly conflict with one another. The secret to figuring out which study to believe is to see who paid for it. I also firmly believe the AMA deliberately gives us bad nutritional advice to ensure we develop chronic illnesses that keep us customers for life.</p>
