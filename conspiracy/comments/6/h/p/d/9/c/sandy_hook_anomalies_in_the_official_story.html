        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>In light of Sandy Hook being back in the news due to Megyn Kelly interviewing Alex Jones (even if the connection isn&#39;t clear),  I was trying to compile the anomalies in the official story in one place without having to wade through hours of YouTube videos that may or may not be relevant from minute to minute.   I broke them in to a few categories under which I&#39;ve placed a few keywords people can Google, while leaving out any links.  Any contributions are appreciated. Also any skeptics or defenders of the official story are welcome.</p>

<p>1) The School</p>

<p>Was The School open? There are claims the &quot;wayback machine&quot; shows a complete lack of internet activity for the school after 2008. But I&#39;ve also seen a purported Twitter account from the principal that was active in those years.  </p>

<p>Do pictures show the school was ADA non-compliant? The handicap parking appears outdated and there are no ramps.  </p>

<p>Do the pictures show decay? Mold, boarded windows, exposed piping all make the school appear abandoned. </p>

<p>Are there records of an asbestos problem with the school requiring it&#39;s closure in 2008? </p>

<p>Why are all the cars facing the building when that would require them to have all been backed in or have been parked at the same time?</p>

<p>Why is there no sign of exhaust from the heating system coming from the roof on such a cold day?</p>

<p>2) The Response</p>

<p>Why was there no surge of EMT? Who declared all the victims dead?  Why was not a single child medivac helicoptered to a hospital on the off chance they could be saved? </p>

<p>It was claimed a couple people were brought to a local hospital but their identities were never released and the hospital barred all media and public. </p>

<p>Why were the bodies never removed until supposedly the middle of the night and why is there no documentation that happened?</p>

<p>Where was the evacuation of over 400 children? We only got the one picture of a row of about ten children.  And in another picture that&#39;s revealed to be likely staged, and taken in a much warmer month. </p>

<p>What to make of the signs the school was the scene of a drill like the &quot;everyone must check in&quot; sign, the water bottles, pizza boxes, portable bathrooms, colored badges, people walking in circles, etc...?</p>

<p>3) The Medical Examiner</p>

<p>He exhibited truly bizarre behavior and didn&#39;t seem to know much about the victims he&#39;d supposedly just examined.  In addition some of what he said was contradicted by the final report.</p>

<p>4)  The Teachers</p>

<p>Who talked to the local paper and identified herself as the school principal, even though she was supposedly dead?  </p>

<p>Why did the librarian give conflicting stories of making eye contact with the shooter and hiding under the desk? </p>

<p>Where are the other teachers? Why were none interviewed?</p>

<p>5) The Parents</p>

<p>Why do several of the parents exhibit bizarre behavior like laughing off camera? Why do so many of them have acting backgrounds? Why does parent David Wheeler appear to have also donned swat gear and pretended to be police carrying his rifle upside down?  </p>

<p>6) The Kids</p>

<p>Can it be proven these children existed?</p>

<p>Why do they resemble so closely the kid models used in the bizarre &quot;End times&quot;  series by Jill Greenberg? </p>

<p>Why was Noah Pozner&#39;s photo used again for a school shooting victim in Pakistan?  </p>

<p>Who sang at the Super Bowl? </p>

<p>Who were the kids interviewed outside? Can it be proven what school they attended? Why did they all report noise like pots and pans dropping rather than massive gunfire?</p>

<p>7) The Shooter</p>

<p>Why was it first reported Lanza&#39;s mother was a teacher at the school? That there had been a confrontation the day before? Why did several supposed witnesses at first agree that she was a teacher there? </p>

<p>Why was Lanza supposedly carrying his brother&#39;s ID?</p>

<p>Would it have been possible for slight Lanza to have carried all the necessary ammo? Could he have fired as many shots as claimed and had such an incredibly high kill rate?  </p>

<p>If 20 kids were supposed to have been murdered, parents of other children would say, &quot;did anyone know the parents? Did any of our kids know the victims?

    <div class="md"><p>How hard would it have been to compartmentalize it? Hypothetical…a man enters the school firing off blanks…people scatter and hide in fear for their lives. Later they are told that some people died. They don&#39;t really know the people as they were new to the community (and many of whom have now left the community). They won&#39;t question a word of it.</p>

<p>Medics were kept out of the school…only a few cops entered</p>

<p>People claim it would take 1000s to pull this off and it&#39;s complete rubbish.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a good point. I guess if the school had been abandoned that might actually make the whole thing <em>more</em> difficult to pull off in some ways. The way you describe it fits with the descriptions given by the few children interviewed on tv</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ahh, critical thinking? </p>

<p>Let&#39;s see. A town full of 27,000 mostly wealthy people knows that a school in their town was used for a fake school shooting. </p>

<p>They&#39;re all silenced. The law enforcement, the school admin (if you believe the school was actually real) the parents, the young students. And their friends. </p>

<p>Why would the whole town know it was a fraud? How many people actually went in the school? Do you know? What do the students and their parents…and their friends...have to do with anything? They, like you, believe what they&#39;ve been told.</p>

<p>For the record we&#39;ve heard from several people from SH (including first responders) that have concerns about what happened that day but they are rightly concerned about voicing those concerns publicly.</p>

<p>You see…there are many people…the majority, in fact…that haven&#39;t spent 5 min researching this yet are willing to denigrate anyone that has…people like, oh, I don&#39;t know…you?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How have you heard from several people if they&#39;re afraid of voicing concerns publicly? If you&#39;ve heard from them, then you can&#39;t complain there is a conspiracy of silence. </p>

<p>The students and parents and kids have a lot to do with it - They live in the same town as the supposed victims. They don&#39;t have to rely on what they see and read in the news. </p>

<p>The school would have been filled with other kids who survived the attack, as well as teachers. If all the kids told mom and dad that nothing happened, well, that would be a bit suspicious? If all the teachers didn&#39;t see anything, well? Don&#39;t you think they&#39;d wonder where we&#39;re all these kids that were supposed to have died? Or they do just take it on faith there was a mass shooting in their small school which somehow they missed the evidence of?</p>

<p>Because they&#39;ve contacted us privately…lol…are you really that obtuse?</p>

<p>As I&#39;ve mentioned to another poster in this thread…if someone wearing a mask walked into the school and fired off a clip full of blanks no one would know the difference. They would have hidden…been scared out of their minds and believed whatever they were told about the level of destruction.</p>

<p>Seriously how hard is that to understand?</p>

<p>If you had 6 relatively new employees at your place of work and I walked in and started shooting off blank rounds…you&#39;d run and hide and believe whatever you were told. If they said the new employees were killed you&#39;d have no reason to doubt it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Unfortunately you have zero corroborating evidence for those statements.</p>

<p>No children have been interviewed publicly that stated they saw anyone shot…there is nothing unredacted in the report of anyone claiming they saw anyone die…and no injuries were publicly shown.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. Not just the media. The first responders. The Connecticut police. The state department of emergency services and public protection. And released interviews with adult witnesses. </p>

<p>You can find multiple examples of this:
&quot;Police Lt. Christopher Vanghele said he and another officer found what appeared to be about 15 bodies, mostly children, packed in a bathroom. So many people had tried to cram inside the bathroom that the door couldn&#39;t be closed, and Lanza gunned them all down, Vanghele surmised.</p>

<p>Vanghele also recalled another officer carrying a little girl in his arms and running for the exit. Vanghele ran with him through the parking lot as the officer repeated, &quot;Come on, sweetie; come on, sweetie.&quot; The girl didn&#39;t survive.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s not evidence…that&#39;s a narrative. You clearly don&#39;t know the difference.</p>

<p>The librarian stated that as soon as the shooting started she went to lock the library doors and saw a man in the hallway with a gun. Lanza never went to that area and the cops hadn&#39;t arrived yet.</p>

<p>Since you put so much stock in those statements then we have a second shooter…and a conspiracy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If someone talking about what they saw is only a narrative and not evidence, then it doesn&#39;t matter what anyone who was there says, does it? But you might want to check all the details of what the librarians (there were more than 1) have talked about.</p>

<p>You also have children who were still alive and brought to the hospital, and then died there. So, the hospital staff would have to be in on this as well. If, as you previously stated, the gun was full of blanks.</p>

<p>Oh, and multiple family members are currently suing NBC for the Megyn Kelly/Alex Jones interview. I suppose the law firm representing these government actors would have to be in on it as well. Or else they failed to do the same due diligence of neckbeards on the internet, who discovered the Truth, on YouTube and message boards. </p>

<p>Anyone can sue anyone for anything in the US…that&#39;s hardly evidence either.</p>

<p>So do you have ANYTHING besides contradictory statements and personal attacks?</p>

<p>Btw…you are correct…it doesn&#39;t matter what anyone said apart from how those statements contradict one another. Try convicting someone of murder without more than just the statements of alleged witnesses.</p>

<p>You need evidence. And there is no EVIDENCE in the narrative or the final report to convict that kid. If I&#39;m wrong…prove it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You mentioned critical thinking previously, but you don&#39;t understand the term. I&#39;ll explain something important.</p>

<p>An elementary element of it is that extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. The burden of proof is on you. You can stomp and storm about the lack of evidence, but don&#39;t forget what your beliefs consist of - only a denial of the official events. You aren&#39;t convinced. You notice idiosyncrasies or inconsistencies, and think that&#39;s a smoking gun - it isn&#39;t. What are the popular ones pointed at by the truthers? The dad was acting funny. They forgot to photoshop the girl&#39;s legs...whatever. </p>

<p>The residents of Newtown, the school staff - all the teachers, admin, janitors - the students, their parents, the law enforcement, the media, the first responders, the health care professionals etc are all lying, either through intense fear or through being complicit?</p>

<p>Someone walked in shooting blanks, and nobody noticed! Nobody saw dead bodies. THEY just said 28 people died, and everyone believed it!SO easy to pull off! Never mind the 2 people who were shot and lived. Or those who died at the hospital. </p>

<p>And what happened to the child actors who supposedly died? Did they get sent into Hillary&#39;s child sex ring!? And what happened to all the surviving parents? Have they vanished...only to sue NBC this week? What have they been doing since? Surely not working at jobs where people have contact with them, or socializing with friends and family who have known them before and after the attack! Oh, no!</p>

<p>A. An unbelievably nefarious group of conspirators, powerful enough to hush up all the potential whistleblowers, and also round up actors to take part in this fakery.</p>

<p>B. Complete imbeciles. What holes do people see, that are pointed out? A discrepancy in the guns...the laughing father...signs of Emile Parker still living...donation pages set up before the event, etc.</p>

<p>A doesn&#39;t mesh with B. You need them to simultaneously be evil geniuses and complete fucking morons. Because the only way these recent popular CT are ever exposed, is through supposed idiotic holes. It&#39;s the same with Seth Rich...they staged a robbery but forgot to rob him! </p>

<p>An elementary element of it is that extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. The burden of proof is on you. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>No…no it&#39;s not. Public resources were used to investigate this event. No evidence from this tax payer funded investigation has been released to the public. FOIA requests denied…Lanza&#39;s personal effects, writings, toxicology report…not released.</p>

<p>The burden of proof…geezus I can&#39;t believe I have to explain this to a grown person…is on the state to prove it&#39;s case against a defendant. In this case the defendant is Lanza. This kid has been pilloried. His name will forever be spoken with derision and hate…yet not one piece of corroborating evidence has been shared with the public that funded the investigation.</p>

<p>The Town Clerk broke the law when she refused to release death certificates to the public. Instead of being reprimanded or punished in anyway the law was changed to retroactively make her actions legal.</p>

<p>A town clerk that also just happened to be engaged to the Newtown Volunteer Fire Chief.</p>

<p>I&#39;m done with you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, you don&#39;t understand burden of proof. I&#39;ll explain it more, since you&#39;re confused. </p>

<p>There is a legal burden of proof which is separate and moot. Adam Lanza is dead, and there Sandy Hook families accept him as the killer. </p>

<p>There is the philosophical burden of proof. </p>

<p>The status quo, the common assumption, is that Lanza did it. You deny it. You&#39;re making the extraordinary claim. The burden of proof is on you. If you deny this, if you try to shift it off you...ok. Guess what? The status quo maintains itself. The common assumption will remain that Lanza did it. The end.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>EMT&#39;s would not go rushing into a active shooting situation. Two  of the first responding cops were also EMT&#39;s, another was a registered nurse. A few minutes after the cops first entered the school, medics were brought in with heart monitors. They used the monitors to check for signs of life. They were in contact with Danbury hospital the entire time and that&#39;s how the they were declared dead.</p>

<p>The check-in sign really only matters if it were there before the morning of the 14th, nothing reported so far says it was.  With all the police, media and medical personnel there it makes since to keep track of who is there and to keep people away who did not need to be there.</p>

<p>With all the people there,  where did you expect them to use the bathroom? Couldn&#39;t go in the school obviously so they brought in porta potties a several hours after the shooting.</p>

<p>And they donated food and water for all the people who were there.</p>

<p>At Columbine, porta potties, food &amp; water were also brought in after that shooting. No one seemed to find that odd.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You mentioned critical thinking previously, but you don&#39;t understand the term. I&#39;ll explain something important.</p>

<p>An elementary element of it is that extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. The burden of proof is on you. You can stomp and storm about the lack of evidence, but don&#39;t forget what your beliefs consist of - only a denial of the official events. You aren&#39;t convinced. You notice idiosyncrasies or inconsistencies, and think that&#39;s a smoking gun - it isn&#39;t. What are the popular ones pointed at by the truthers? The dad was acting funny. They forgot to photoshop the girl&#39;s legs...whatever. </p>

<p>The residents of Newtown, the school staff - all the teachers, admin, janitors - the students, their parents, the law enforcement, the media, the first responders, the health care professionals etc are all lying, either through intense fear or through being complicit?</p>

<p>Someone walked in shooting blanks, and nobody noticed! Nobody saw dead bodies. THEY just said 28 people died, and everyone believed it!SO easy to pull off! Never mind the 2 people who were shot and lived. Or those who died at the hospital. </p>

<p>And what happened to the child actors who supposedly died? Did they get sent into Hillary&#39;s child sex ring!? And what happened to all the surviving parents? Have they vanished...only to sue NBC this week? What have they been doing since? Surely not working at jobs where people have contact with them, or socializing with friends and family who have known them before and after the attack! Oh, no!</p>
