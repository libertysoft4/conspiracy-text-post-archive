    <div class="md"><p>i dont know if that was /s but...</p>

<p>i dont like Alex Jones, its just obvious if we didn&#39;t have forces to keep invading places we couldn&#39;t invade places which means less war which means more peace which means less money for weapons companies wgich leads to less kickbacks</p>

<p>so everyone (incl you here)  turns a blind eye so we can have money and manufactured patriotism and indoctrination and xenophobia</p>

<p>Telling OP he&#39;s made an uninformed decision and to get out is not the same as shitting on him. Quite the opposite.

    <div class="md"><p>No one can answer those questions but you man and you should probably ask people you know in real life who have been there. You don&#39;t know who the fuck you are talking to here. Beyond that, war is going to happen, will you make it better or worse? Do you have kids? If not, something to consider. If yes, will they be taken care of? Is anything more important than them?  If you stay, can you live with the guilt of knowing you could have saved some lives?  Because that can suicide a person. But so can going.  As far as enabling the MIC, yes and no, someones gonna do it so until there is a coordinated resistance effort, its gonna happen, take advantage if you can or skip it amd save yourself the heartache. With your training you are good either way, you will save lives as long as you go to work. To be honest, its up to you to keep your head up either way, both paths have their rewards and pitfalls. Whatever you do, if you do go, don&#39;t second guess shit while it&#39;s happening.  Get it the fuck done and figure it out on your downtime.  Take care and good luck.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My advice is get out right now</p>

<p>Who knows what you will have to see and do over there</p>

<p>Nothing noble will be accomplished by your presence</p>

<p>The troop worship rampant in america is a BAD thing, and should be actively discouraged</p>

<p>The fact that the marines and the like hang around outside high schools saying &quot;ya wanna be a man son&quot; is only true because everyone labours under the illusion that the troops are heroes</p>

<p>If you want to help people how can any form of military be the correct place to be?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t know about any of the stuff when I was in, but looking back, I wish I could do it all over again. You need to get what YOU can out of the military. They will use you that same as they would use anyone that would fill your place. Get your education, save your money, START AN IRA WHILE YOU ARE YOUNG!!!! </p>

<p>Being a medic is a noble thing for a person to do, and you should be proud of that. Don&#39;t mind all the things happening in the big game, because you will never have all of the information on a subject. You can never be certain what the truth is, except for that bleeding man laying in front of you, who needs you right now.</p>

Absent this, in a total &quot;libertarian&quot; utopia, the military would be bought and controlled by the biggest corporations, and would protect their assets at home and abroad. The military could essentially, literally, strongarm their competition in the marketplace. Since we have a nationalized military, the ideal state (in my opinion, and in name) would be for the military to protect the borders and citizens of the nation from foreign invaders and aggression from external enemies.</p>

<p>The military in this country has become entrenched in ways contrary to its original mission. In my opinion, this &quot;tradition&quot; began at the US decision to enter WW1 on the side of the British. At the time, there was no clear interest for the Americans to enter war, and the result of that war was to create such an imbalance of power in Europe, and such a weakened German people, that the pendulum of nationalism swung to such an extreme that Europe&#39;s subsequent conflict became almost a certainty. When WW2 broke out for reasons that I won&#39;t go into, the US again was faced with the decision of whether to engage in another European conflict where its citizenry had very little interest in the outcome (no, the Germans and the Japs didn&#39;t want to &quot;take over&quot; America, that is known as post-war atrocity justification propaganda). Some will disagree, but I believe at this juncture, FDR, whose New Deal had had only limited success in wresting the economy from the Great Depression, wanted to enter that war, with the goal of the Military Industrial complex bringing the economy fully back to speed. It worked. The US dropped tens of thousands of bombs on European cities, destroying historical architecture and artwork, killing men, women, and children indiscriminately, slaughtering hundreds of thousands. It dropped two hydrogen bombs over Japan killing hundreds of thousands more innocents. The infrastructure that supported this slaughter raked in the benefits, and after the war, the US was able to craft the governments of the losing Axis powers to its own benefit in the international marketplace. The side effect of the communist victory in the East was even more beneficial, as it allowed for a continued excuse to increase armaments, without even needing to engage in actual combat.</p>

<p>This model was so successful for the elites and the ruling class that I believe it&#39;s been the norm up until this day. Seek out a foreign entanglement. Enable the weaker party, calling the mightier party &quot;evil&quot; or &quot;amoral&quot;. Arm the weaker party to create greater unrest. When the stronger party defends itself, label it an authoritarian dictatorship, claim it is engaging in some form of genocide if at all possible. Destroy its central power structure. Install puppet government that will do your bidding and encourage similar unrest in neighboring countries.</p>

<p>This is the model currently being followed by the US military, and while I detest it, I don&#39;t think the military personnel simply following orders are enabling it any more than the American VOTERS, swayed easily by simple sentimental ploys, continuing to elect leadership in Congress that engages the US unnecessarily in these foreign wars, complaining about high income tax and then voting in favor of throwing more tax money down the drain for literally no improvement in quality of life at home.</p>

<p>Saving lives is a noble calling. And if you decide to follow it, see if you can convince other servicemen of the truth behind the military industrial complex, is they aren&#39;t already aware, because awareness is how this changes. The US military will always find new, young recruits, ignorant of the truth and begging to be part of something &quot;bigger than them.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re just furthering the aims of WAR, INC. (USA) in my opinion.  </p>

<p>I think soldiers should be drafted, not Paid, Voluntary with Benefits.</p>

<p>The USA has added to the misery of millions of refugees in Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan, Yemen (etc.) -- and stayed in Iraq/Afghanistan so WAR, INC. (USA) can continue milking the cow that is the US Treasury.</p>

<p>In Iraq, I agree Saddam was not a just leader--but it was also a sovereign nation with a right to be run as the people of Iraq chose.  I&#39;d point out there were no terrorist event in Iraq in the year before the US-led invasion (and if there were--certainly nothing like the daily/weekly bombings Iraq has experienced ever since).</p>

<p>Since you mentioned &quot;storm trooper&quot;--I recently saw a quote George Lucas (?) made about Star Wars...the USA is the Empire (as related to Vietnam).  <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=george+lucas+star+wars+empire+vietnam&amp;amp;t=ffsb&amp;amp;ia=web">https://duckduckgo.com/?q=george+lucas+star+wars+empire+vietnam&amp;amp;t=ffsb&amp;amp;ia=web</a></p>

<p>why not become a paramedic, or go into nursing, or any medical job around you? why be involved in an institution that also kills (military) as opposed to an institution that aims to save (red cross, hopsitals, etc)?</p>

<p>The idea is that if the US government ever fell away from the constitution by way of internal subversion from a foreign or otherwise illegitimate power there would be agents of the people who would stay at their posts (and actually infiltrate other government institutions) and work in secret to repel the subversion from within.</p>

<p>Released the same time that the FBI background check of Trump&#39;s father was done.</p>

<p>i.e., if you believe that the government no longer represents the will of the people or upholds the constitution then you should understand that there are agents of the people and constitution who  outwardly profess loyalty to those in power.</p>

<p>Also, you guys are getting some incredible tech shortly, medical too.</p>

<p>Make your own decision for your own reasons, but know that there are patriots who are deeply embedded into the deep state and are working in secret to return this nation to the Republic the people deserve.</p>

<p>But speaking from experience, it&#39;s not too bad of a life on the civilian side and definitely rewarding.  A nice balance between the two worlds as probably 1/4 of EMS are veterans.</p>

<p>Get your EMT/EMT-P national registry asap if you don&#39;t already have it.</p>

<p>If I was in your position I&#39;d stay as you will have a hell of a front row seat to some of the biggest events in the history of humanity the next 4.5 years.</p>
