        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Following is my reply when a user asked me to back up my claim the larger subs are Controlled and Manipulated.  After I posted the below comment, the user then messaged the mods of r/news and r/politics asking them for comment.  r/news nazis instantly banned me (couldn&#39;t give a fuck since I haven&#39;t participated there in well over a year, when I was banned there for the first time).</p>

<hr/>

<p>r/news banned me for simply posting links critical of the F-35...if you consistently post articles critical of the PentaCon they&#39;ll ban you, too.  Even if it&#39;s from a more MSM source like Reuters.  r/news also took down a post I made about James Blake being tackled by NYPD--I had posted the original article&#39;s title (plus a quote, which was allowed) as written by NY Daily News--mods took it down because it had NYPD in the title.  Then I posted a copycat article by the Guardian (which was sourced entirely on info from the NYDN article) --it stayed up and got got to #2 or 3 (because no mention of NYPD was in the title).  Original post would have most likely stood at 1 and stayed there for quite a while--so the mods essentially removed the post which had an actual quote by the victim, James Blake (former US tennis pro).</p>

<p>In r/worldnews and r/politics I&#39;ve experienced the comment section being Rigged--with my comments being slid down the comment thread (even though they were far above any other comments in terms of upvotes...and, yes, I know they change the top comment after a few hours via algorithm).  I also had a post rocket to #1 in worldnews and then stall out and begin falling quickly (I swear they  turned the counter off--the mods said they can&#39;t do that...but I think the admins Can and Do.)</p>

<p>I wish there was a good way to compare the number of articles from various sources in worldnews over the past 5 years--I&#39;m guessing the MSM sources have become much more dominant; and the truly independent sources have seen noticeable reduction.  One time I caught the Front Page of worldnews with 18/25 articles sourced from just 3 sites: BBC, independent &amp; guardian.  I also think I caught them upvoting an article to try to displace mine--I actually reported their post and it got taken down (hilarious...I forget what the violation was, but I saw it moving very quickly, reported it with an authentic rules violation and they had to remove it).  </p>

<p>r/politics was one of the most noticeable subs to begin scrubbing content -- mods would just delete the post and leave a removal comment with a bot&#39;s tag.  Last year they began removing posts even 3 months old--so people searching for info can&#39;t find the article/post.  Despicable.  Ironic that r/politics hosted a Jesse Ventura AMA last year--they won&#39;t be accepting his RT show (channel is banned from sub).  I&#39;m guessing the AMA was a paid promo for Jesse to market his book (and good propaganda for the sub).</p>

<p>9/11 is practically <em>verboten</em> in those subs (only exceptions are Saudi lawsuit posts, health of first responders and 9/11 victims&#39; family statements). One of the admins even got caught admitting in a comment thread r/worldnews was started to <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3tkyhn/til_the_worldnews_subreddit_was_created/"><strong>specifically exclude 9/11 material</strong></a> .</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So do you have any evidence of these submissions and comments that allegedly got you banned? </p>

<p>No offense, but in my experience, 95% of the time when people are complaining about being censored, the real story is that they broke the rules of a subreddit.</p>

<p>Right or wrong, if you break the rules you get banned....</p>

<p>I&#39;ve had posts as old as 3 months removed via bots there. (don&#39;t visit that sub anymore--but actually removing posts via bot is pretty over the top as it makes it allows the mods to censor topics).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve had a terrible experience over at <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> ever since they only allowed approved/mainstream sources to be posted there.  No more self posts, and only mainstream titles can be used.  They can remove anything they want and do so for anything controversial.  It&#39;s not worth the time anymore.</p>
