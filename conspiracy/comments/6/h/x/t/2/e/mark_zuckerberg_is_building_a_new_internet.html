        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Facebook has been working on a new version of the internet in third world countries called the Free Basics project. I came across this a while ago and I&#39;m shocked at how many people don&#39;t know about it. I did a little digging about it and found <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/01/facebook-free-basics-internet-africa-mark-zuckerberg">this</a> article.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Even if people are hungry, we shouldn’t be giving them half a loaf,” says Gbenga Sesan, whose organisation Paradigm Initiative Nigeria helps young people living in poverty get online.</p>

<p>“It’s difficult for me to argue against free internet,” he says. But he added that it is problematic to give people only part access to the internet, especially if <strong>they believe what they have is full access</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These people in Africa don&#39;t have much experience with the internet. They don&#39;t know that Facebook&#39;s watered down version of the internet (Free Basics) isn&#39;t the full version. Facebook could control everything these people see and they would have no idea.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A person might not have enough money for data, or the government might not have installed broadband cables in the area where they live, she says. Or the internet that is available might be in English, and therefore not useful to all. Or, McCarty adds, <strong>the person might not have been taught IT at school and would not know how to use the technology.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>For some of these Africans, this Facebook branded internet will be their only viable option. Like I said above, this is more proof that Africans are not being taught the IT skills that they need to see through the bullshit of Facebook&#39;s locked down internet.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In a competitive emerging market, giving away data for free may not seem like an obvious business choice, but Facebook has sold it to mobile operators on the basis that customers will eventually buy data.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So eventually the plan is for Facebook to sell access to this data. Think of Facebook&#39;s main business operation though: collecting user data and selling it to marketers. I guarantee any internet that Facebook develops will be for that purpose as well.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This freemium to premium model is also problematic, says Gbenga Sesan. “As soon as you are around the table you become a marketing opportunity,” he says, adding that there is a perception that <strong>internet rights campaigners are not supposed to ask questions about Free Basics “because it’s ‘for good’”.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is insane. I&#39;m immediately skeptical of anything you&#39;re not allowed to ask questions about. Facebook shouldn&#39;t be the moral authority on whether one of their products is &quot;for good&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Facebook has yet to release official data on how the initiative has been received across the continent, but when the Alliance for Affordable Internet looked at how eight countries, including three in Africa, were using such zero-rated services including Free Basics they discovered <strong>only one in 10 connections came from someone who had never used the internet before.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Facebook&#39;s stated purpose is to get more people on the internet. They&#39;re apparently doing a very shitty job at it since only 10% of connections come from someone who&#39;d never been on the internet. Judging by this data, Free Basics is supplanting the internet in Africa.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“The application is used as a stop-gap measure,” says Nanjira Sambuli, a Kenyan tech expert. Most people use it to browse when they have run out of data, but switch back to the full web when they can afford it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So right now people are switching back to the regular web when they can afford it. If the price of the internet goes up, more people would flock to Free Basics. Africa is probably the most corrupt place in the world. Zuckerberg could easily work out some deals to drive the competition away and drive more people to Free Basics.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Although Zuckerberg has been outspoken on his commitment to freedom of speech <strong>“the fear is that Facebook becomes the broker between citizens and the government,”</strong> says Geoffrey Wokulira Ssebaggala, from the digital rights organisation Unwanted Witness Uganda.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This really scared me. A corporation should not be the broker between citizens and the government.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t really speculate on Mark Zuckerberg&#39;s goals and motives, but they can&#39;t be good. He most likely wants to sell information to marketers and expand Facebook on an international level. However, a lot of bad can come from giving a corporation the power to control information to any country, especially ones with relatively uneducated populations.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It isn&#39;t changing the subject, it is pointing out similar issues here and how they are looked at differently. If conservatives are all for that here and all for companies being able to use their power however they want you find any of them caring about the issue in africa because they are one hundred percent behind facebook.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Try re-writing. I can&#39;t make any sense of what you are trying to say. Also, the original topic has <strong>nothing to do with politics</strong> and simply focuses on facebooks nefarious intentions.

    <div class="md"><p>Well, Facebook&#39;s Free Basics package does threaten net neutrality, because it lets you access some websites for free and makes you pay for data to access other websites. This can be abused to control people&#39;s access to information using the fact that people don&#39;t want to use up their data.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, it limits their access to information by dictating which sites are free and which require payment. The net neutrality dispute in the U.S. isn&#39;t about access to websites, it&#39;s about allowing fast lines for companies that pay for it instead of allowing all websites equal speed.</p>

<p>fb bought out all the most popular social media. at one point fb asked you to take a picture of your ID to prove the name you&#39;re using is legit. next to phone numbers and all that.</p>
