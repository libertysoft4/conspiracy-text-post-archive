    <div class="md"><p>They&#39;re sex is changed because of an imbalance in estrogen. To think that Atrazine wouldn&#39;t cause an imbalance in estrogen in humans when it happens in amphibians is unlikely.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll refer you to steroid users with an estrogen imbalance to see what you think about estrogen and feminization. Not sure why you&#39;re being so condescending about this</p>

It&#39;s really strange about the later one, because they always mention how &quot;one parent&quot; in particular is outraged about him, but what about the rest? I mean, shouldn&#39;t all of the parents be outraged if it&#39;s not fake?</p>

If someone&#39;s pushing shame, they&#39;re putting themselves on a hero ledge of sorts.  This isn&#39;t to say that there aren&#39;t measurably better or worse designs - there are.

<blockquote>
<p>To save you a click, he has a book coming out entitled: <strong>How the Right Lost Its Mind</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Flat earth</p>

<p>Reptilians are here and running our government</p>

<p>Obama will take all our guns</p>

<p>Jade Helm</p>

<p>Obama will let us all die from ebola</p>

<p>Obama will turn the US into a caliphate and he is muslim</p>

<p>Obama used a time machine to change his birth certificate</p>

<p>Obama is (was) banning all wood burning stoves and kids&#39; chores</p>

<p>Obama will stop all oil drilling in the US</p>

<p>The stock market will nose dive to nothing under Obama because he will purposely destroy the economy with liberal powers</p>

<p>Obama watched benghazi live on a closed circuit camera, ordered aid to stand down</p>

<p>Liberals all are communists who want to turn us into Russia (which has now become the right loves Putin and neither he nor trump can do any wrong, praise be their names).</p>

<p>Hillary is a ninja and has assassinated untold thousands of people from her evil lair and there is one hundred percent proof of it but the msm won&#39;t cover it daily and thus the courts won&#39;t act</p>

<p>Hillary and podesta rape and murder kids in a magically appearing basement and then use them in spirit cooking as toppings on pizza (note, never buy a handkerchief with a pizza on it, only illuminati satanists do that)</p>

<p>The msm never attacked bill clinton or obama and the msm is only nyt, wapo, cnn, msnbc and the three networks. No other media is allowed to be called msm.</p>

<p>As far as active: Looking into Eritrea and their potash mines, seth rich stuff (basics, not off the wall), and several others that I won&#39;t go into until I have more details (involve charities, funny money, etc).

    <div class="md"><p>Generally not seen anything while hunting (I go for the evp&#39;s and finding interesting stories to investigate).</p>

<p>I did see something odd once while stopped at a light. Homeless guy with a sign standing on the bridge, dec 24th, about 1pm. I looked up at the light on the right to see if it was turning yellow, looked back and he was gone. He had nowhere to go.</p>

<p>At one cemetery stumbled across the grave of a 13yr old who was murdered (said so on the stone, which was odd) in the 1870s. I spent months investigating that, have about 250+ megs of data - looks like the man blamed, who was lynched, was probably innocent and it was his wife that did it.</p>

<p>Sorted through years of papers, comparing stories and accounts to get one large one. Very involved story. Still need to wrap up one last thing before completed and hope to this summer (visited the graves of her family, tracked down current family, etc). The local area historical society didn&#39;t have what I had so sent them everything for their collection (the murder of the girl has a small mention in their museum when you enter).</p>

<p>Just love digging into things. </p>

But I see now that it is because you most likely have a critical thinking and skeptical mind. Excuse my rudeness for asking the question under false pretenses. I would love to see some submissions on stuff you are working on though. I am also very interested in ghosts and would welcome new information to digest.</p>
