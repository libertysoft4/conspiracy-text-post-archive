        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Premise this with I&#39;m a long time lurker and first time poster. I felt i had to come and say something because I think it&#39;s important to highlight some items that I see are getting lost in the recent wave of shit posts on this sub.</p>

<ol>
<li>johnson and johnson baby powder fucking causes cancer. This should be at the top of the news since the day it came out. i believe this could have major implications on large corporations.  I&#39;m still blown away how this is still not the top news every day</li>
<li>THE DNC RIGGED THE ELECTION!!!!! just imagine if all the bernie sanders folks actually realized this. there would be millions of people in DC protesting. If they organized like they did for sanders and went to the capitol...People&#39;s heads would roll perhaps literally.</li>
<li>They are trying to remove the shit protections they put in place on the banking industry after the 2008 collapse. ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME?!?!?!</li>
<li>The are in the process of making cash an alternative forms of currency <strong>ILLEGAL</strong></li>
<li>Net Neutrality is back in the US as a topic, how dare people report news that doesn&#39;t follow their narrative!</li>
</ol>

<p>While I know everyone is excited about pizzagate and the seth rich murder but I can not stress enough that if we focus on these three things or just one of them, then quite a bit in america and maybe the rest of the world will be a much better place.  Seth Rich most likely died showing us how this election was rigged, it is in my opinion that we should follow through on that for him. We need to end the rigged elections and jail the people responsible.</p>

<p>Not to mention I guarantee the swine at the DNC (and RNC) will spill the beans to who really ordered seth rich&#39;s murder when they realize that the jail house awaits them or even better yet...the gallows.</p>

<p>Please do not take this as me discounting PizzaGate or the Rich murder. I actually believe that this shit is really going on, but at the end of the day, i bet it will be nearly impossible to take this type of investigation to the top. These people have contingencies for this stuff, but <strong>NOT</strong> for what Seth leaked. Come on, their best excuse is russia. </p>

<p>What i am saying is that there needs to be more of a focus here which in turn will actually trickle to the rest of the community on reddit as well in the real world. That is why there is a massive influx of shills posting any type of conspiracy they can, to keep us off point.  If there is a group of people online that could effect real change in this world, i think it is us conspiracy nuts, especially now that people are realizing we aren&#39;t nuts at all. Just some of you ;)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The rich murder is totally fishy, but i think that is because when he was murdered there was public outcry.  People wanted to know what the hell happened.  The establishment had their story, people were interested in it so they filled it with so much shit it will be nearly impossible to get to the bottom of the bowl.</p>

<p>Call me a crazy optimist but this past several months it would appear that some of their contingencies have failed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If heads are going to roll for the primaries fraud, Bernie Sanders should be the first one under axe.  Him covering up for the DNC is why his supporters aren&#39;t in DC protesting.  He could rally all his supporters again with the truth if he wanted.  But he&#39;s really an establishment sheepdog.</p>

<p>I 100% agree with you.  The statement, which re-reading doesn&#39;t articulate what I&#39;m trying to say all that well.  I was simply referring the total amount of people that supported sanders.  I never had the bern, nor will i, just another puppet.</p>
