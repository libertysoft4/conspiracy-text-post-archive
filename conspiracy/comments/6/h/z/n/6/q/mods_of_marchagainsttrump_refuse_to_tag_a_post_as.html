    <div class="md"><p>Users in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> talk shit about their own sub all the time, including you right here with that comment. They also criticise T_D and get heavily upvoted for it as I have shown below.

This doesn&#39;t make any sense. </p>

<p>Maybe you should just try to realize that we are not all one entity. There are tons of different people here who have different interests. Just because stupid things get upvoted on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> by some people doesn&#39;t mean that other people should be disallowed from posting about other subs. </p>

<p>I&#39;m saying that this sub leaves fake news up all the time and t_d engages in <strong>exactly</strong> what MAT is being accused of here. </p>

<p>Basically, everyone does this bullshit now, fake news exists and people now use it to justify whatever result they want to justify. Whatever you believe, that&#39;s someone else&#39;s fake news, between the media, conspiracy blogs, Reddit, the President, Russian propaganda, everything is someone&#39;s fake news.

    <div class="md"><p>Again, you should keep in mind that OP is not a mod here and you are comparing mod actions (allowing fake posts) of this sub as if they were committed by OP, which is unfair and off topic with a discussion of MaT. You also appear to be putting out an attempt to normalize the deliberate distribution of fake information, basically saying that we shouldn&#39;t care what MaT has done here today because it&#39;s &quot;normal.&quot; </p>

<p>I want to also point out again that people criticize this sub daily for any bullshit posts, but when OP brings up this behavior in MaT, everyone floods in here with all of these weird justifications that this is &quot;normal,&quot; why should we even care, <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> does it too, and whatever else. In all of the criticisms of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, I have never seen someone say &quot;It doesn&#39;t matter, why do you care, other subs do it too.&quot; This is definitely one of the weirder comment sections I have witnessed on this sub. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What MaT did was much worse than anything T_D has ever done. </p>

<p>The <em>top mod</em> of MaT posted a blatantly false article that had already been retracted by the reporter involved. Many of the top comments on the thread pointed out that the news was false.  MaT mods then deleted all of the comments pointing out the false claims and locked the thread, all while continuing to gather upvotes on the front page (or more likely, their upvote bot network continued to pump upvotes into the thread). </p>

<p>At least with T_D, the mods won&#39;t mass delete comments pointing out why the article is wrong, or the mods will amend the title, or other posts will pop up warning against the false article. </p>

<p>What MaT did was about the most horrendously deceptive and disgusting example of fake news I&#39;ve ever seen on this site. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Where is the conspiracy&quot; is the most frequently posted question in this sub. It&#39;s starting to get pretty annoying. The thread was locked to disallow corrections on the comments. The mods didn&#39;t tag the post as false or remove it (until about 30 minutes ago when it dropped off the front page of <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a>)). It sure looks nefarious to me. </p>

<p>It also shows how stupid it is to let a news organization off the hook for retracting and correcting a claim. The original fake news can continue spreading and CNN should have been monitoring where the fake news was gaining traction and tried to stop it. This shows how important it is for a journalist to get the facts straight the first time. </p>

<p>None of the commenters are doing so. Everyone is just &quot;lol breitbart&quot;. And when asked why it shouldn&#39;t be a source just more diversions and no discussion, just &quot;lol you don&#39;t know?&quot; type stuff. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look. Brietbart is the worst kind of propaganda site. Andrew Brietbart was exposed a very long time ago with his John Kerry swiftboat campaign. That was &quot;fake news.&quot; The site had a &quot;black on black&quot; crime section. The site became the promotion hub for James O&#39;Keefe and his &quot;fake news&quot; videos. This was highly publicized and he was discredited -- but only after the long-running citizens&#39; rights group was destroyed. </p>

<p>Every article at Breitbart supports a political party or pushing in the same direction. There are many sites like this, including the notorious Share Blue. NONE of these sites are credible. Considering my first paragraph, why would Breitbart be? Not finished ...</p>

<p>The establishment oligarch that funds Breitbart and supports Donald Trump, Robert Mercer, recently came out of the closet. This means that Breitbart is not a real business -- but rather a front for the establishment masquerading as a &quot;news&quot; source.</p>

<p>Robert Mercer, who was a major player in creating the illusion of &quot;outsider&quot; Donald Trump also runs a multi-million dollar PAC with Mitch McConnell -- discrediting this whole notion that Donald Trump is an outsider.</p>

<p>These facts are common knowledge and need not be explained every time someone posts a Breitbart article.</p>

<p>Consider &quot;Breitbart LOL&quot; to be the shorthand for it all. :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are approaching this from a very reasonable perspective, but you should realize that although these points seem to be settled as facts in your mind, other people would disagree and believe that you are blinded by your own biases. That&#39;s the tricky part about coexisting on the internet, because there are always underlying assumptions that lead us to believe what we do, and it is conceivable that sometimes things are more complicated that one realizes and we get things wrong which seem to be obviously true.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m absolutely not suggesting that one should give up on truth and believe nothing, but it is important to leave some room for doubt any time we are operating without all of the puzzle pieces, which is unfortunately most of the time when it comes to matters which affect an entire society. Despite what you personally believe to be the correct resolution to this lack of complete information, it is courteous to distinguish these biases when communicating with others who may have different biases, and be prepared to support your believes with specific and substantive arguments when there is genuine disagreement.  </p>

<p>Of course some people just don&#39;t give a fuck and throw their beliefs around wildly without consideration, and you can&#39;t really have a rational debate with such people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wholeheartedly agree with your perspective. The rules should be there to distinguish between people that are contributing in good faith and people who generally post low-effort comments, either intentionally to damage the community or because they are just lazy.  </p>

<p>I have made several attempts to explain this in other threads, but I&#39;m glad to see that this kind of consensus is emerging from the moderators. For example, I think that people should be allowed to discuss possible shilling tactics that appear in the comments as long as they explain their concerns thoughtfully and don&#39;t just call &quot;shill!&quot; against anyone who disagrees with them. Likewise, if somebody posts concern that a thread doesn&#39;t belong in the subreddit (where&#39;s the conspiracy?), then they should be expected to do so in a thoughtful and substantive way.  </p>

<p>You mean 1 other post, right? You&#39;re still doing it. It&#39;s at 89 percent upvoted, but that doesn&#39;t have anything to do with the topic, does it?</p>

<p>How does posting something to two subreddits make the post false? It doesn&#39;t. Where is the rule in either of the two subs that says I can&#39;t cross post? It doesn&#39;t exist.

<p>Because it was at the top of <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a>. People here also complain about <a href="/r/the_donald">/r/the_donald</a> on a daily basis. When I show false information coming from an anti-Trump sub, suddenly a bunch of accounts in this thread claim &quot;nobody cares.&quot; </p>

<p>What does this have to do with this thread? Many other people already criticize the Donald for their shitposting. I haven&#39;t noticed The Donald on <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> anymore, but I do see a MaT thread there several times a week.

<p>I like how in that example you&#39;re attacking the source of the fake news and in this example you&#39;re attacking the subreddit that&#39;s promoting it.</p>
