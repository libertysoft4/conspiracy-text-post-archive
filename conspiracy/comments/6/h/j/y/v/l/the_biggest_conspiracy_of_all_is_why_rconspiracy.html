But I&#39;m not sure if that is the country you were implying. It is a mixture of Israel and many foreign countries inserting people into our government with agenda&#39;s that do not put America as their priority. However, blackmail operations done by foreign and domestic intelligence agencies is a huge part of why American politics is the cesspool it is right now.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Russia was among the hardest-hit economies by the 2008-2009 global economic crisis: the economy plunged 7.8% in 2009 as oil prices plummeted and foreign credit dried up. The economic contraction was the sharpest since 1994, but no long-term damage was caused due to the government and Central Bank’s proactive and timely response to ring fence key sectors of the economy, in particular the banking sector, from the effects of the crisis. As a result, Russia’s economy began to grow again and increased 4.5%, 4.3% and 3.4% in 2010, 2011 and 2012, respectively, before slowing to 1.3% in 2013 and 0.6% in 2014.</p>

<p>The Russian economy experienced two major shocks in 2014, narrowly avoiding recession with moderate growth of 0.6%. The first shock was the sharp decline in oil prices during the third and fourth quarter of 2014, exposing Russia’s extreme dependence on global commodity cycles. After fluctuating within a tight band near USD 105 per barrel from 2011-2013, crude oil prices ended 2014 at less than USD 60 per barrel. The second shock was the economic sanctions resulting from geopolitical tensions, which negatively affected investor appetite for Russian investments. Capital flights and high inflation compound Russia’s economic woes as the economy registered the steepest contraction since 2009 contracting 3.7% in the full year 2015.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know why ? Because of the context ... We know there is a media machine out there that is working for the Globalists. So when we see a candidate been ridiculed every single time he has run for president by all the corporate media and then this last time he actually won!! And after he won they still keep attacking and attacking . I would say something went terribly wrong. I personally don&#39;t like Trump but I respect his determination having the world tell him to quit that it&#39;s over  that he is a joke that he will never be president to stop making a fool of himself..... And against all odds he won... I fucking respect that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a constant attempt to paint as a pro Trump subreddit. There is also a constant attempt at shilling and creating division and fighting by turning the subreddits content extremely political as of late. Nothing gets people arguing like partisan politics. There are also legitimate Trump supporters, and the people who hold on to the hope that he has been lying to everyone and is slowly building a case against the Pedophiles, human traffickers, and other unsavory business that our government is engaged in.</p>

<p>However, I believe it to be division, distraction, and divide and conquer tactics and they are working beautifully.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think questioning the holocaust is the problem, or the endless seth rich posts... it&#39;s the complete lack of Trump-Russia connection posts.

    <div class="md"><p>The personality of this place is absolutely not truth seeking. It&#39;s completely partisan. I never see a damn thing thats anti-Trump on the front page. Any post that&#39;s bad for Trump gets downvoted immediately. We have a president under criminal investigation right now for o struction of justice and not once has the story hit the front page. In a fucking conspiracy sub. That&#39;s how over run this place has gotten with Trump cheer leaders that don&#39;t give a shit about truth. We&#39;d rather mass around 4chan posts about how everyone is out to get Saint Trump who is the coolest god emperor ever. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why do people pretend that only one side is &quot;pro-government?&quot; Seriously, this doesn&#39;t make any sense and I find it hard to believe that people actually have this position. Just think for two seconds about what you believe. Assuming you are taking a side, either pro-Trump or anti-Trump, you are &quot;pro-government.&quot; You either support Trump and his administration (and some republicans), or you support the Democrats (and the other anti-Trump republicans), the mainstream media, the FBI, the CIA, and all of the other intelligence agencies (that is if you believe the leaks, the intelligence agencies&#39; claims, and the media&#39;s reporting on Trump). There are many people in this sub who are pushing mainstream media narratives here, many times literally quoting anti-Trump media articles. If you are one of these people, then you cannot say that the other side is &quot;pro-government&quot; without also admitting that you are pro-government as well. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. I simply don&#39;t care about pro-Trump or anti-Trump content, because I see our system for what it is. Trump is simply another in a long line of Presidents that is beholden to special interests. No difference from Obama or Bush. Might as well be the Hillary Clinton presidency. Most of the attacks on Trump are superficial (he tweets bad things, says bad things) or still unfounded. Why anyone on Earth would believe intelligence agencies that say &#39;the evidence is there but we won&#39;t show you&#39; is beyond me. I simply view Trump as a great distraction, which really is the ideal puppet. Everybody focuses on the puppet, so much so that the puppet Master ceases to exist in their reality.

It only represents the political and financial figures who stay while the public-facing administration changes (like the Presidency).

Pro-Trump messages barely get any traction here with any of the normal users, and as anybody knows the comments sections of any thread are what to look for, not who&#39;s actually posting bullshit articles because they are easily parsed out.  Go into any thread that even smells like it&#39;s being fair or balanced towards Trump and bet you the top comment will be something destroying the initial premise of the article itself, no matter how accurate it is.  Or you can just look at people like yourself, who are pushing a negative message and slandering the entire sub yet you&#39;re getting a hugely-disproportionate amount of upvotes that doesn&#39;t reflect the mindset of this sub in general, whereas comments calling for civility or trying to look past the political angles get downvoted to shit.  And that&#39;s because people like you come from r/politics, r/all and the other hundred plus anti-Trump subs to brigade the shit out of this sub, and then point the finger at TD when you get called out.  You do know we can check your profiles right?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>news surfaced that the editorial team at Russia’s largest state-owned television media company, VGTRK, had been ordered by management - widely understood to abide by Kremlin instructions - to halt all coverage of Mr Trump, a move that appears to reflect Moscow’s frustration with the White House’s hardening line on Russian aggression in eastern Ukraine and its annexation of Crimea. In a comment piece published in Deutsche Welle, Konstantin von Eggert, a political commentator on Russia’s last independent television station, Rain TV, wrote that a friend at VGTRK’s editorial team had received orders that “could be reduced to a short sentence: there will no more of Trump”.</p>

<p>The Moscow establishment was shaken by the resignation of the US National Security Adviser Michael Flynn earlier this week, who had previously been considered by the Kremlin has a reliably pro-Moscow voice in Washington. It was further rattled when White House spokesman Sean Spicer gave a clearly worded statement that Mr Trump expected the Russian government “to de-escalate violence in the Ukraine and return Crimea”, a position that was compounded when Mr Trump tweeted on Wednesday: &quot;Crimea was TAKEN by Russia during the Obama Administration. Was Obama too soft on Russia?&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But thats the exact same thing that is happening now. Senators and Congressman on both sides are still taking huge payouts from corporations and Trump is still receiving donations from outside entities and doing business with rich, terrorist funding Gulf states,  as well as using millions of taxpayer dollars on expensive golf trips every weekend. It seems like its the same problem, but with a different face that the mods have grown fond of for some reason, telling people to shut up and respect the president. That&#39;s not condusive to creating a space for freethinking, like the founders of this sub intended.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, the Deep State (CIA) is in cahoots with the Washington Post it appears. They are one of the chief papers attacking Trump regularly. I don&#39;t have time to source this, but there are connections with Bezos&#39; purchase of the Washington Post and contracts with the CIA going to Amazon. I go to the Washington Post to see what the CIA wants me to believe, not what is the news of the day. It&#39;s still useful that way. So I have to wonder why they are so against Trump. </p>

<p>The intelligence community (Deep State) keeps leaking things about Trump.</p>

<p>There seems to be a concerted effort unlike any I have seen in my life to remove him from office. </p>

<p>And I am not a Trump supporter. I&#39;m a Bernie fan. But Trump did run on draining the swamp. I don&#39;t know if that was just hyperbole. If it is was authentic though, the Deep State wouldn&#39;t like that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m a Bernie supporter too, and totally open-minded. The deep state is the permanent ruling establishment in the U.S., based in our &quot;intelligence community,&quot; mainly the CIA, DIA, and NSA, as far as I can tell. They have enormous power, but far from total power (we&#39;re legalizing marijuana right under their noses).</p>

<p>The Washington Post has a major history of CIA collaboration, going back to Katherine Graham. I&#39;d be surprised if Jeff Bezos wasn&#39;t a CIA collaborator, and the expose of him in The New Yorker last year only solidified that for me. </p>

<p>But where is this concerted effort to have him removed from office? Obviously, many liberals and progressives are trying the best. I assume you mean mainly the Russia probe? Comey is a representative of the deep state? But what if he&#39;s not? What am I missing? Trump seems to be working for the financial elite class very effectively. Tax cuts for the rich, didn&#39;t end up cutting drug war funding, threatening medical marijuana, conservative Supreme Court justice, privatization of education, more billionaires in his Cabinet than ever before- what about this does the Deep State not like, other than maybe killing the TPP? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The conspiracy theory community is not necessarily anti-government, correct. In fact the conspiracy community doesn&#39;t really approach policy at all. People here are of all kinds of political persuasions, but we are commonly bonded by our disdain for corruption, collusion, unjust violence and war, and general fuckery at the behest of the elite that own this planet. Outside of that, the conspiracy theory community doesn&#39;t really have a place. I&#39;d say honestly that this is largely to the detriment of society, because we should talk about policy. Without that conversation, this community will never be a movement. Perhaps that isn&#39;t a topic for this subreddit, but then again I would argue that reddit&#39;s entire structure subdivides spheres of knowledge to the detriment of society, too. </p>

<p>On a more related note, despite the fact that the conspiracy community is not explicitly anti-government, it would be quite hilarious for members of this community to propose that the election of a president would have any meaningful impact on the broad systems responsible for the cabalistic power structure deeply rooted in our society-even if you are a trumpeteer. Even if you aren&#39;t anti-government. Change takes time. If your goal was to address these issues of corruption and collusion laid at our feet in this generation of man, you would need a multi-generational plan, and perhaps we do not have that time. If you genuinely, honestly believe our situation is in any way salvageable, you are living on a prayer my friend. I know I am. Humans are destined for extinction.</p>

<p>Do you know how many people it takes to count all the votes? Not to mention the paper votes are kept as so they can be recounted if need be (which they were in 3 states). They couldn&#39;t just take them all and make up a number.</p>

<p>I&#39;m tired of entertaining your idea. It requires a huge stretch of the imagination/truth and is far less plausible than the alternative. If the deep state could completely rig it, Hillary would be president right now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah this deep state kinda sucks if they couldn&#39;t even get their deep state president elected to keep power in the deep state. Or maybe the deep state is in the White House and you were all fooled by the deep state to vote for the deep state.  Trump did win with less votes sounds like a deep state rigged things to me. Maybe the deep state is a bunch of Russians that invaded America after the Cold War and trump was part of their deep state plan cuz he was forced to borrow money from them cuz the deep state of the 2000s crashed the economy and the new deep state took advantage of trump cuz he has dementia and they knew?!?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because nobody and nothing in this world is infallible. The rumor is that everything was calculated down to the precinct to give the election to Hillary by injecting custom vote-weighting code into voting machines in 11 key states. According to Alex Jones (I know, save it), DHS cyber-security people monitoring the election system blocked their intrusion in 6 of the 11 states just on or before election day, giving Trump the election. It&#39;s possible. The look of utter shock and desperation of talking heads on CNN was incredible. They were on the verge of having panic attacks as if they were caught in a lie and they had no idea what narrative to sell, as if there was no way this should have been possible.  </p>

<p>Nobody said the Deep State is all-powerful. That is a strawman you are creating to argue against. However, make no mistake that the Deep State is very real. It has been partially neutered under the new administration, but I have no doubt that they have multiple contingencies in motion.</p>

<p>From where I sit the man knows how to manipulate the weak minded and told them what he wanted to hear - then in front of next group changed his tune and told them what they wanted to hear.</p>

<p>He lies all the time and people won&#39;t call him on it here because they want to believe things. The man literally suckered millions of people with a faux anti-government message, but a message we know the russians love as they know they can&#39;t beat us in a war...so they have went after the government itself. Make people believe are own government is the most evil one on earth for generations and that we need to destroy it.</p>

<p>And that has what has happened. Folks elected a man who had no morals, values, or principles and lied to their faces every single day. And now these same &#39;patriots&#39; are hoping the united states will crumble to the ground. Who is gonna step in when that happens?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was posting here last year and iirc year before that.</p>

<p>I was banned here for a time before the election for posting a photo of trump being helped by the secret service (front page here had one of hillary). Some mods didn&#39;t want me banned (and several left around that time, still talk to one off line) because I had been a contributor to this sub.</p>

<p>I have been following conspiracies since around the time I was 11, about 40 years ago (ufos, kirlian photography, pyramids, bermuda triangle, etc).</p>

<p>I have interviewed people on them on the radio and done my own shows on them and am currently doing several investigations for future shows (which have been delayed since my son and nephew have moved in here, been busy of late). </p>

<p>I look into conspiracies with the intent to find the truth and realize that it is hard work. Some things I look into don&#39;t pan out, which is fine because you look for truth.</p>

<p>My oldest son and I have spent time debunking local urban legends here in Ohio (Bloody mary grave, Andrew hellman, etc) - we do so by trying to find the truth whereas others just repost the same lies online without investigating them at all (these things have come up while ghost  hunting).</p>

<p>The estate tax rates in the chart only tell part of the story. There is also a lifetime exemption -- that is, an amount you can give your heirs that is excluded from taxation.
This lifetime exclusion amount is one aspect of estate taxation that has changed for 2016, up by $20,000 to $5.45 million. Note that this includes property you leave your heirs as well as cash, so items such as houses count toward the exclusion. It also includes taxable gifts you give while you&#39;re alive, not just the possessions you pass on after you die.</p>

<p>He does want to drain the swamp. The Washington Swamp. He wants to replace it with his own swamp of rich elites who benefit from America business. </p>

<p>I reluctantly voted for Trump. Took me a long time to get on board. The reason? I believed he&#39;d drain the swamp. I never expected him to <em>remove</em> the swamp. I knew there&#39;d always be a swamp. But it was a value call. </p>

<p>He&#39;ll drain the swamp of people who&#39;s benefit to themselves is not a benefit to the average American. Trump, however, seems to be draining the swamp of those people and putting in his own people who benefit (himself included) from American industry. That helps middle America, even if it&#39;s just as corrupt. </p>

<p>If my only options are corruption I can benefit from, and corruption I can&#39;t, I&#39;ll take the former every single time. </p>

<p>You don&#39;t have to be bashing the government 100% of the time in order to be &quot;anti-government&quot;. Case in point - I&#39;m a huge anti current-feminism person. However, there are feminists I like and there are parts of the feminist doctrine that I think are accurate and valuable. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I really think that is a big part of his strategy. He is forcing them to act first and expose themselves and they hate every second of it. If they call his bluff and let him act with the full authority of the presidency, they risk actual legal prosecution of their corruption and treason, something which was unthinkable even one year ago, something Trump knows they won&#39;t let him do without a bloody fight. They are locked in a balancing act, and Trump is holding onto them in a death grip while the people slowly catch on and finally wake up. Once the masses begin to understand the depth to which our republic has been compromised, it may be finally be possible to do something about it, and do it right.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m speculating of course, but still cautiously optimistic.</p>

<p>The historic reaction to a communist takeover of a country is reactionary nationalism.  Regardless of your position on nationalism, the pro government people didnt just show up out of nowhere.  </p>

<p>Did anybody ever imagine that the conspiracy would become that the president <em>isn&#39;t</em> doing the terrible things he&#39;s accused of? Never, in a million years, did I ever see myself defending the president from wild conspiracy theories. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s pretty simple, actually: a lot of people still think he&#39;s on their side. All he had to was put on a little red cap and make some abrasive statements, and suddenly he was seem as some kind of populist, anti-globalist, anti-PC savior. Him talking about banning Muslims and about Mexico &quot;sending&quot; their rapists was basically like that trope where the undercover cop does heroin to prove he&#39;s not a narc. After he said this kind of stuff, he was seen as &quot;one of their own,&quot; despite being a multi-millionaire who flies in a literally gold-plated airplane. Despite his being a proven compulsive liar that would make Hillary blush, they see him as reliable because he &quot;speaks his mind,&quot; or in other words, says what they want to hear. </p>

<p>These people have their heads so firmly buried in the sand that even when Trump inevitably does a terrible job as president, they&#39;ll just blame the Deep State instead of admitting that he was an unqualified candidate who was never on their side in the first place. They&#39;re so addicted to the idea of finally having &quot;their guy&quot; in the White House that there is going to be a lot of kicking and screaming before they wake up—if they ever do.</p>

<p>It begins with the current media assailing our president elect and attacking his legitamicy.</p>

<p>Hillary Clinton meeting with Comey on a runway </p>

<p>Chairman Podesta and the frightening things he&#39;s connected to. The fact he controls the Washington Post and is behind a ruthless Democrat propaganda machine. The documented threats against promoters of Pizzagate</p>

<p>Everything and anything to do with Seth Rich. </p>

<p>The false media reports prior to the election predicting a landslide victory by Clinton being the same media demonizing the president elect.</p>

<p>Yesterday Republicans among them a senator all being shot at a baseball game </p>

<p>The investigative committee of Congress headed by Gowdy and his valiant pursuit of truth essentially operating at the front line of the American people to find truth in this mess.</p>

<p>Recently resigned Jason Chaffetz and his contributions amid rumors of his resign due to death threats.</p>

<p>Dispelled all my conspiracies and suspicions in regard to the left and right being one in the same etc and election being rigged. I now KNOW that the people still have power and I support our elected officials. &amp; regardless of what all the tinfoil says here America isn&#39;t all lost yet</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s fair to question the holocaust on a sub like this.  I don&#39;t, but if you&#39;re asking a conspiracy sub to just shut up and accept events as they&#39;re reported, you&#39;re probably going to have a bad time.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think questioning the holocaust is the problem, or the endless seth rich posts... it&#39;s the complete lack of Trump-Russia connection posts.  That&#39;s a big deal, but no one here wants to think about it?  Sessions says under oath that he can&#39;t remember a meeting we have pictures of, and no one wants to tunnel down through that?  </p>

<p>Everyone here is so focused on Pizzagate, and no one wants to talk about the link between Jeffrey Epstein and Donald Trump?</p>

<p>That&#39;s the problem and I hope it&#39;s fixed.  The complete lack of good faith posts.  These people don&#39;t give a shit about stopping pedophiles, they just want to hurt Jon Podesta.</p>
