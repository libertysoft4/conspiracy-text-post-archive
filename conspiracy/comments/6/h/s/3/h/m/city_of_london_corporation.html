        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The City of London Corporation is a one mile square block in London where the 110 Livery Companies operate from. The 110 Livery Companies represent every industry in the global market. Most major corporations today are connected with the Livery Companies through proxies or subsidiaries. Business at the City of London is mostly private and they conceal ownership through private contracts. The Knights Templar of London were headquartered at the inner temple of the City of London and today are the Order of the Garter headed by the British royal family and British Peerage. The City of London Corporation, Knights Templar, and Order of the Garter all use the same red cross as a symbol. The Knights Templar were merchants and bankers that held gold for pilgrims who traveled to Jerusalem and provided them with bank notes which were used at the Templar&#39;s merchant shops along the way. The Knights Templar established modern banking. London merchants have a monopoly on gold and silver which they use as leverage over the markets and monetary system. They also manipulate the price of gold and silver from London. This Templar merchant and banking system is rigged and functions like covert monopolies through hidden corporate conglomerates.</p>

<p>Foreign members of the Order of the Garter include King Juan Carlos of Spain, King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden, Queen Margrethe II of Denmark, King Harald V of Norway, Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands, and Emperor Akihito of Japan. They are members of the Order of the Garter because they covertly do business in London. The United States is a federal corporation defined under US code 3002 section 15 and is really a continuation of the Virginia Company. The Virginia Company was issued by the British Crown from the City of London Corporation for North American settlements. They are using the Bank for International Settlements as a proxy to steal from corporate governments through foreign tax contracts like the Belgian Scheldt Dues. They then launder and conceal the wealth in private Swiss bank accounts. Washington DC was established as a municipal corporate state and headquarters of the United States through the 1871 District of Columbia Organic Act based on debts owed to foreign entities like the Hudson Bay Company, Irish Government, and Kingdom of Belgium. Prince Lorenz of Belgium works at Gutzwiller bank in Basel Switzerland right near the Bank for International Settlements and is overseeing the private accounts of the royal and noble families.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The European Monarchies are basically branches of Rome and the Holy See. Many constitutional monarchs and members of the royal families are members of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta which is the oldest knighthood on the planet and a sovereign entity headquartered in Rome. Members include King Juan Carlos of Spain, Grand Duke Henri of Luxembourg, Karl von Habsburg of Austria, King Philippe of Belgium, Queen Paola of Belgium, Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands, Vittorio Emanuele of Savoy Prince of Naples, Duke Franz of Bavaria, Prince Carlos of Bourbon-Parma, Princess Elizabeth von Thurn and Taxis, Prince Alois of Liechtenstein, and Prince Jaime Count of Bardi. Prince Carlo Massimo is President of the Italian Association of the Order of Malta and he is covertly overseeing the SMOM and Sovereign Council for the Black Nobility. The Pope is a monarch controlled by the Black Nobility. Rome grants a form of sovereignty to monarchs for their allegiance to Rome. The SMOM is older than the Knights Templar Order. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The UK never even used the Euro. Brexit was a strategic move as part of a planned engineered economic downfall in Europe where the UK would be financially stable to unify the rest of Europe as the United Kingdoms. The European Union is based on the Treaty of Rome and the EU was founded in Rome at Capitoline Hill. Mario Draghi was born in Rome and runs the European Unions Central bank.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It has very little influence over the pound. The UK is very self reliant and has a large amount of assets and resources as well as the ability to trade outside of Europe. Is the Brexit hurting the UK? Minimal negative effects and I would argue a devalue in the pound is mostly engineered. Their plot was to influence other nations into leaving the EU which do use the Euro. If individual members of this unified group start exiting the EU it would cause a large economic downfall in Europe and particularly in the nations part of the EU which I believe would be strategically initiated by surprise. An organized withdrawal with the EU would have a safer result. Rome engineered this since the EU is based on the Treaty of Rome and was signed in Rome. Rome has major influences in the UK through the City of London Corporation and in Europe. Italy funded most of the wars in Europe putting nation against nation until it took control over their leaders along with using agents to infiltrate banks and royal families They also control France and Sweden through the House of Bernadotte and House of Bonaparte and those families basically control the European Roundtable of Industrialists or ERT which has leverage over the EU and European economy. The ERT is an extra piece of leverage that Rome created. Why are they reacting in this way? Propaganda. Most are in on it and the plan is more centralized control. Order out of chaos.</p>
