    <div class="md"><p>The US, since WW2 has had a really bad habit of getting tangled up in other countries affairs. Some of them were proxy wars with Russia during the cold war (Korean War/Vietnam), others were completely at the behest of a nation (6 Day War, Desert Storm). </p>

<p>The last time the US faced a potential real threat was in WW2, and not really from Japan, but from Germany itself. This primarily happened due to the Pres being tricky, he wanted to support the English without Germany openly declaring war on the US. However, there are many accounts of German uboats patrolling just off the eastern seaboard. </p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMS_Lusitania">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMS_Lusitania</a></p>

<p>Most of that was kept from the American people who were against being involved in the war. Had they known how close the threat really was to their border, they may have risen a bit faster to join the war - at the very least to defend the seaboard. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Germans/Hitler refused to follow through with the conquest of England.  What makes you think he would&#39;ve done anything about another country half a world away?  From the bombing of London onward, Germany made it clear that it was more interested in self-sabotage than any real offensive.  Russia in the dead of winter?  Hell yeah!  Finish off London while it&#39;s crippled?  Nope.</p>

<p>And this isn&#39;t even mentioning that Lusitania was almost certainly a false flag, or at the very least, a baiting mission, looking for an excuse to go to war.</p>
