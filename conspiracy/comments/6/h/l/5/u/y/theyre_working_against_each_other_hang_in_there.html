        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><strong>The Trigger</strong>
You may have noticed a post on r/all calling conspiracy out as T_D 2.0. This was triggered by a r/Conspiracy moderator&#39;s comment calling for non-partisanship. This statement confirmed that the intention of this sub is not to fall in line with the likes of r/Politics, r/WorldNews in their astroturfed bias.</p>

<p><strong>Team One (T1)</strong>
The people we see regularly bumping each other to the top of contentious threads in this sub, only to discredit and mock content and those interested in sharing their opinions. T1 forces the topic at hand to be sidelined, which ensures the real conversation slides and can only be seen by a &#39;controversial&#39; sort.</p>

<p><strong>Team Two (T2)</strong>
Work to spread disinformation throughout Reddit about r/Conspiracy being r/The_Donald lite. They recognise that conspiracists in this sub are not discouraged by downvotes, as downvotes often reinforce suspicions. The aim is to discredit this sub.</p>

<p><strong>The Conflict</strong>
T2 are sharing posts as examples of a supposed r/Conspiracy pro-Trump bias, but T1 have already &#39;worked&#39; these threads so top level comments are anti-Trump and generally condescending.</p>

<p>This causes a huge conflict in their intended narrative. 
T1: r/Conspiracy has an anti-Trump bias.
T2: r/Conspiracy is T_D 2.0.</p>

<p>It can&#39;t be both, and if it is, surely it disproves both options and indicates a balanced view across the board.</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t already have me tagged as &#39;The Donald&#39; on RES, I&#39;ll save you the trouble of checking my post history. I post in r/Conspiracy AND r/The_Donald and fully anticipate general derision and dismissal as it&#39;s a primary shut-down tool used by both teams.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Gas lighting is there though, talking about Pizzagate and the Seth Rich murder aren&#39;t talking about Trump, it&#39;s talking and making a point of government corruption. Political pedophila isn&#39;t monopolized by the Democratic Party see Lawrence King, George Bush Sr, Boystown, and the Call Boy Scandal. These issue can and should be talked about, yet ShareBlue who works for that VERY SAME government won&#39;t bring it up because that works against their and their bosses interest. So instead it&#39;s a pro Trump conspiracy when it shouldn&#39;t be.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That was an example of what you are decrying, yes. I believe you may be taking a leap in logic, and that perhaps you are lumping all posts that even discuss these topics, whether they have merit or not, into the same category as the post you just linked, without vetting those posts for credibility or not. I could be wrong, but that is just how I see it, based on the tone and attitude you are conveying. If I am right, you ought to take a step back and look at why you are even here in the first place. If I am wrong, then at the very least you could be more respectful to your fellow man and realize that there are some people posting here that legitimately want to know the truth about these subjects to the best of their abilities. It isn&#39;t all pro-trump, right wing spam, and you really paint your comments as if it is, which is in and of itself misinforming and obfuscating.

<p>You honestly think it&#39;s that strange that people are defending the President?  Especially considering how recently and how contentiously he was elected?  Why is that a bad thing?  If people agree with him, why wouldn&#39;t they defend him?  I fail to see how this would be a problem for you or this sub.

<ol>
<li><p>I think you missed something in your analysis. The amount of trump defending/anti-dem posts on the front page isn&#39;t the same as comments being critical of trump or his admin. The suggestion here being vote manipulation (bots/brigading).</p></li>
<li><p>The perceived reaction by mods who flair popular posts critical of trump and/or removal of such posts which has happened. Add into that a recent sticky in a thread that was a trump tweet.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>And lastly, the idea that being critical of trump is somehow bad when he is the president and the insinuation that we should bow to those in power and not criticize them any longer. He is part of the wealthy elite and only has his own best interest in minds. He is a smooth talking liar who has filled the swamp when people voted for him because he claimed he would &#39;drain it&#39; (which was just a meme he made up with no real plans on what he would do). </p>

By painting us as the t_d2.0 they can delegitimize what this sub stands for and hijack what it believes.

Government has been and will continue to be a vehicle for the wealthy and powerful and that &quot;democratic monopoly&quot; or &quot;monarchy&quot; will continue until you can decentralize it by asking for individual liberties and freedoms. </p>

<p>politics shills are astroturfing this place hard.</p>

<p>Believe it or not, it&#39;s a good sign. We have been hitting very close to home on some very dark and corrupt people and organizations here lately...and now they feel the need to try and compromise what we do here. r/conspiracy is <em>the</em> only sub on reddit that can discuss these subject matters without getting bombarded with the shrill comments of the MSM zombies that inhabit the other subs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Remember this though.. they know that we know that they know that we know what they&#39;re doing. The obvious tactics that we can see right through are for the masses, yes. However, because they know that <em>we</em> know, I&#39;m positive they have special mind control plans for us that is harder to see through. It&#39;s always reverse psychology with them. They know what they&#39;re doing.. and they know what <em>we</em> are doing. This is why data collection is so important to them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Political provocateurs,  both pro-Trump and anti-Trump have overrun this sub and created a more hostile culture than  what used to be here.</p>

<p>Before the run-up to the last election people here could be of one political leaning or another and, despite those differences, would focus more on conspiracy theories and ideas upon which they could agree, or at least debate respectfully that which they may not agree.</p>

<p>Now this sub is a much more divided and contentious place where people focus  much more on disagreement, attack, and division. The longtime regulars and those who have any degree of history here tend to not buy into the illusions of our governemnt and society that is presented to people by the MSM. The false reality of our politics and society is something they woke up to and saw through a long time ago.</p>

<p>Today there is a large influx of new users and groups, on both sides of the left/right, GOP/DNC, liberal/conservative who are much more partisan and tribal and much less woke and aware of the larger picture than before. These groups are still invested in the division and tribal worldview that they have been indoctrinated into over the course of their entire lives. These groups, and their divisions, are played out in the brigaded upvoting and downvoting in the comment sections, and because they are numerically significant, play a much larger part in the content of the front page these days. They have brought their views and their fighting into <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, and in my opinion it is going to take some time for them to research conspiracy topics outside of their personal political agendas so they can be truly &quot;awake&quot; to the larger illusion of the political and social realities of our our world. </p>

<p>When current conspiracy works it&#39;s way into the mainstream I  think what we are seeing play out in this sub right now is somewhat inevitable and unavoidable. The influx of active new users is going to somewhat overtake the prior tone and culture of this sub. </p>

<p>The fact that these new users stay here, to me, is a good thing. This sub needed an infusion of new users, and my hope is that the longer they stay here and participate the more aware and awake they become as they research and look into all the other, less politicized and partisan conspiracy topics that pierce through our current fabricated reality. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Or it could be the Pro-Trump groups have access to lots of bots, to push threads up, but not a lot of people so the comments don&#39;t reflect the bot driven threads.  </p>

<p>Similar in vein t_d claims 6 million subs, yet they have success rates of sub 1% when every one of their actions are outside of the reddit. Such as <a href="https://voat.co/v/TheDonald">https://voat.co/v/TheDonald</a> hitting 10k subs, and <a href="https://voat.co/v/ThePedes">https://voat.co/v/ThePedes</a> hitting only 3k.
Other examples of their small numbers:

    <div class="md"><p>If they have bots to push threads up why is <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> constantly dominated by anti-Trump posts?</p>

<p>There&#39;s a ton of overlap between conspiracy theorists and Trump supporters. It&#39;s really not that complex of an idea. </p>

<p>Also, the 6 million number came from reddits own advertiser site. They didn&#39;t make that up. Reddit did. </p>

<p>Touching on the overlap again, why would people that are largely anti-establishment put their name and info on a White House petition about a conspiracy theory? Maybe check the comments where those petitions have been posted. The majority will say &quot;fuck that, I&#39;m not putting my name on that&quot;. </p>
