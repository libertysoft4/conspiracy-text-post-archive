Look at the top 3 religions that shaped history and civilization: Christianity Judaism and Islam. These religions collectively are responsible for the most bloodshed and human loss of life. They all come from the same little area called Israel. The prophets are the same mostly, the Old Testament is in all three of the sacred Texts. I personally believe in aliens, and I think even tho I&#39;m agnostic, some crazy shit happened in that little patch of land long ago, and idk I&#39;m sure it could be an extra terrestrial related event that happened that caused these three groups to interprets it differently, because these three religions are the only ones who have tried to spread their beliefs throughout the entire world wether by conquest or bloodshed or &quot;missions&quot;. Anybody else think like me? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wholeheartedly believe that Yahweh is a reptilian called Yaldabaoth, the demiurge. Created by the goddess Sophia - goddess of wisdom, when she desired to create something without the balance of the divine masculine. He thinks he is the true God of this Earth, when in reality, he is only gaud. He is a jealous God, he is a prideful God, he is a God that requires blood sacrifice. I believe this is why so many children are being raped and tortured at the highest levels of government. Yaldabaoth, &quot;the lord&quot;, and his archons have infiltrated every aspect of our government to install a Draconian system of living. We have to pay to live on this planet. Every aspect of this planet is being ruled by reptilian forces. Everything is up side down. I have had a dream of the Goddess Sophia, and I got a confirmation that it was 100% her. I also believe I have had a dream of Yaldabaoth himself. Truly surreal dreams, and I would love to tell you more if you&#39;re interested. Christos-Sophia is what I think is the final piece of the puzzle. <a href="http://ascensionglossary.com/index.php/Christos-Sophia">http://ascensionglossary.com/index.php/Christos-Sophia</a></p>

<p>Yahweh is coming back with his chariots/UFOs to &quot;harvest&quot; the Earth, and there will be blood. Jeffrey Daugherty was a Protestant minister for 20 years and has over 100,000 hours of biblical study. He now makes videos about how Yahweh is actually a reptilian that is waiting for the people of Earth to be ripe enough for the harvest. There will be blood. You need to check him out. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iapk90rdj28">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iapk90rdj28</a> He should be right up your alley. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow that video is great. This planet is a cosmic vineyard and whence we are ripe (when our blood is saturated with fear) we are eviscerated and feasted upon. Those fucks get favors in return for &quot;ripening&quot; us. Interesting.

    <div class="md"><p>Oh God, where do I begin ? So U are telling us U watched one video from a delusional person on YT and instantly felt like this &quot;theory&quot; is fact ? I bet U haven&#39;t even put in the time to research this stuff before posting some of the worst if not the worst religious theory i ever read.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll begin with this only paragraph to show u how ridiculous that theory sounds and wait patiently for a reply.</p>

<p>If Yaldaboath is God (Yahweh as u stated), how in the blue fuck is he/she/it one of the first 12 angels who fell on earth ? And is a child of another God ? If God himself is the creator of all things in the first place ? He is the master of the material world which makes him Satan in the Christianity religion. He is an Archon, which is a parasite who feeds on negative human emotions. This doesnt seem like God to me at all, more like morning star himself.</p>

<p>Precisely. Yaldabaoth is the false god of this Earth. He is not god. He is gaud. </p>

<p>Reptilian is just another word for Demon. Snakes, snakes everywhere. Which btw depicts Yaldaboath and Satan. Same entity IMO.</p>

<p>Yaldaboath the Demiurge might be YHWH, the jew false God. So i hope that u are not confusing our God with the jew&#39;s one.</p>

<p>Yes! My God is source, not Yahweh. My God is not damning anyone to eternal hellfire. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What happened in Israel is the literal spirit son of God came down as a human being and blew everyones minds by preaching a new message with authority from God his father and backed up his message by healing the sick and raising the dead. He claimed to be their Messiah, the King of the Jews, but the Jews rejected him as a blasphemer. They killed Joshua the Christ and then the Romans and the Jews persecuted true Christianity almost out of existence using creeds, edicts and decrees. The Roman Catholic version of Christianity was then allowed to thrive under the rule of the Roman Emperors starting with Constantine the Great in 325 AD and then Emperor Theodosius the Great making Nicene Christianity the official religion of Rome in 380 AD. They literally killed those who disagreed with them, burned their books, persecuted their disciples, forced them to say their trinitarian creeds.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Question for you, do you think God is a literal man in the sky or can it be another advanced species.

    <div class="md"><p>I believe God is a spirit without a physical body, his presence is a fiery unapproachable light.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all.&quot;Ephesians 4:6</p>

<p>Hebrews 12:29 &quot;for our God is a consuming fire.&quot;</p>

<p>I mean think about we humans basically play god</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We were given dominion over the Earth because it was created for humans, God doesn&#39;t really have a use for this Earth except for it to serve as a home for his creation, it was given to us, but we dropped the ball for thousands of years, now the son of God has regained dominion over all things after it was lost by Adam and offers us the chance to enter into his kingdom by faith.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Then God blessed them and said, &quot;Be fruitful and multiply. Fill the earth and govern it. Reign over the fish in the sea, the birds in the sky, and all the animals that scurry along the ground.&quot; Genesis 1:28</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you get deep into spiritual journey with Jesus you will find that Christianity should have more gnostic beliefs, Jesus taught a doctrine where he expected us to pick up where he left off, doing the same things he did:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Truly, truly, I say to you, whoever believes in me will also do the works that I do; and greater works than these will he do, because I am going to the Father.&quot; John 14:12</p>

A masking of the real history it talks about, which is from northern Egypt and nearby, and is actually about the pharaohs who ruled over it.  I&#39;m not sure if it was written originally, this way, or if it was retconned sometime between the Babylonian and Greek empires.  The library in Alexandria, with it&#39;s unprecedented centralization of knowledge, provided an excellent opportunity for some history to be &quot;rewritten&quot;, and the rest of it, destroyed.</p>

I also tend to favor the idea of aliens as a catalyst to humans developing religion. Though it might have been simply looking up and seeing all the stars. Who knows? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Question for you, do you think God is a literal man in the sky or can it be another advanced species. I mean think about we humans basically play god when we made all those dog breeds years back, and we play god now when we create our own viruses and restructure DNA. I even think we&#39;re like a god when we create open world video games. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess I never asked anyone else. I just feel like there&#39;s a correlation between those three religions that aren&#39;t coincidental, and I think that some event happened that shook people&#39;s lives. They didn&#39;t know how to describe it, thus religion came </p>
