<p>Yes &quot;he posed some questions&quot; but for the most part everyone graciously tried answering them. He would than go ask them same basic question, reworded a little differently again to the same person or another person.</p>

<p>He was trolling, he didnt care what answers anyone gave. he questions were the answer.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was a troll for conflict, not an invitation to discussion. It also was not relevant to conspiracy- unless the conspiracy is </p>

<p>All the people trying to frame this sub as T-D 2.0, when this sub&#39;s political leanings tend toward a slightly uneasy coalition of anti-autoritarian right and anti-authoritarian left. That&#39;s why people here tend to generally hate both McCain and Ryan <em>and</em> the Clintons and Pelosi, and to generally respect Kucinich, Ron Paul, Gowdy, Cynthia Mc Kinney - even though their policies represent an enormous range of very left and very right. The US has been more divided lately than I&#39;ve ever seen, and people on this sub generally see that the partisan divide does a good job of keeping us divided and fighting amongst ourselves, while those at the highest levels of power are not the two ideological groups that the msm narrative portrays, but just one, united by power and corruption - one that must be fought. This rejection of the ever widening parisan divide is a threat to power structures that prefer us divided and squabbling over crumbs, and posts like that only exist to slide the narrative back to the fruitless squabbling.</p>

<p>There is an entire sub that exists if people truly want to ask Trump supporters questions, and it could have / should have been posted there. That it was posted here instead represents an agenda. Those who believe that it was posted to foster the free exchange of ideas are kidding themselves.</p>
