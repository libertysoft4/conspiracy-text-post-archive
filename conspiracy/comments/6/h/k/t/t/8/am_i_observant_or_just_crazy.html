        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><pre><code>  To the invisible entities that govern this world and especially this country (The U.S.), people are nothing more than resources here to generate money. Much like produce to a farmer, for example. No ear of corn or chicken egg is any more special or any different than the other. They&#39;re simply resources and the more the farmer has, the more money he/she makes. 
</code></pre>

<p>That&#39;s what civilians are to the runners of the world. Resources. And how are resources most easily managed? Separately. A farmer doesn&#39;t grow carrots in the same patch of soil as tomatoes. It would be too difficult. Too much could and would go wrong for the farmer. So he/she grows them separately to more easily and more efficiently manage them. And that&#39;s exactly how the governors of the world manage us. By keeping us separated. </p>

<p>But unlike ears of corn, people are free thinking individuals so how can they be kept separate for easier management? Surely not by physical force. No, because then we, their valuable yet expendable resources, would surely see the stupidity of the hatred we hold among ourselves l. We&#39;d then band together and overthrow their oppression. No, it has to be more intricate and cunning than that. It&#39;d be easier and more effective to control their minds. And how do we control their minds? Through media and propaganda. Pit race against race by saturating the news with stories (even fake and scripted stories, if need be) of things that will make each race find the other repulsive. Stories about things such as white police officers killing unarmed black children to fan the flames of black-on-white hatred and show only the most ignorant blacks speaking about violent happenings in their neighborhoods so that all other races generally view blacks as nothing more than inferior savages, thus fanning the flames of all-on-black hatred. </p>

<p>Give them entertainment websites like &#39;WorldStar Hip Hop&#39; and &#39;Someecards&#39; that promote hatred. This promotion of hatred won&#39;t even need to be subtle as long as it&#39;s entertaining. Like sponges, those silly &quot;people&quot; will absorb anything that entertains them. Also put racism in their television PROGRAMS, and call it comedy. Never let them forget that they&#39;re different and teach them that racial difference is a bad thing. </p>

<p>Also, pit gender against gender by fanning the flames of what they call feminism, meninism and sexism. Through their computers, music and televisions, convince them that neither side is getting fair treatment and that it&#39;s the other genders fault. Have the main music in heavy radio rotation be music that tells each side that the other is not worthy of trust, true love or respect. Music that is made up of lyrics of infidelity, mistrust, disrepect and even hatred for the opposite sex. Because music is one of the most, if not the most influential medium in existence. </p>

<p>Remind them constantly that they should be angry with each other. Keep them at each others throats. Sugar-coat what&#39;s actually bitter loneliness and call it independence. Put the harshest and most damning of lyrics over a pleasant melody, add a catchy hook and they&#39;ll willingly feed it to their minds which will then hinder their judgement, decision making, individuality, empathy, self-confidence and even common sense. Yes. Sell them hatred and ugliness. As long as it&#39;s all wrapped nicely and tied up in the pretty bow that is entertainment, they&#39;ll buy it. </p>

<p>People will follow what&#39;s being programmed into their brains through media, making them want to be separated from each other, thus easier to control. Thanks to entertainment, propaganda, the education system, religion, politics and people&#39;s sheepish tendency to believe and follow most anything they see and hear, feminisn and meninism will go from a fight for equal rights and opportunities to a battle for which side should be able use the other as a doormat. Racism will last forever. Hatred will prevail. Humanity will suffer. And we will always be in control. Genius. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. There&#39;s a powerful group making less powerful people fight each other. This occurs at multiple levels of global society. Pick any social divide, real or imagined, they&#39;re leveraging it.</p>

<p>Yes. At some level we&#39;re just resources and numbers to someone &quot;higher up.&quot;</p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t call this all genius though. It&#39;s ultimately insane and just as dangerous for those at the very top as it is for everyone else. Those at the top are just hoping whatever supposed solutions they have actually work.</p>

<p>At anytime we can still decide to take our power back and do solely what supports us as individuals, our loved ones, and our communities. They need us way more than we need them. We can cut them out. Sure there will be oppression that follows this kind of action. Once a critical mass of communities gaining their independence from the establishment is reached, their plan fails. Everything gets reset. Huge masses of people are seeing this now. This is why they are becoming more militant. This is why we must continue to care for each other.</p>

<p>All their control is based simply on an illusion. It&#39;s extremely fragile. They just propagate all kinds of lies and distractions to make people loose and forget hope. Fear and sadness makes them more powerful. Caring for each other makes us more powerful and reduces our fear and increases our happiness.</p>

<p>Hatred can&#39;t prevail because it&#39;s self defeating, because hatred is simply ignorance. Humanity has, and probably always will suffer, but it&#39;s always worth trying to reduce suffering. Suffering hasn&#39;t killed us yet and, biologically it makes us more able to resist suffering.</p>

<p>We&#39;re always in control, always have been. There&#39;s more of us than them. They need us. We don&#39;t need them. We will win in the end.</p>
