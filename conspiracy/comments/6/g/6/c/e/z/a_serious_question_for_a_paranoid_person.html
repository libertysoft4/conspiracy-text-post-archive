        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>While I have been a lurker for a long time, I have been posting more often, and I guessing my views which I consider to be anti establishment could be misconstrued as anti government. Make no mistake, I am a die hard patriotic American, and want nothing more than for my country to rededicate to integrity, honesty, and truth. 
  Today I flew for the first time in a little while, and I&#39;m not going to lie, I was a little scared by what happened. Every single time I spoke with any airline representative, from check in, to security, to boarding pass, some things happened that have NEVER once happened in my years of air travel. 
  In the morning when we checked in, both my partner and my baby had zero issues. For some reason the computer told me I needed additional assistance to check in. The woman had to call for a supervisor to put in a &quot;code&quot; for me to print my boarding pass. There body language was very strange, and as someone who reads people well (expert poker player) I really felt there was something that wasn&#39;t being said. He put the code in and I got my pass printed, but there was such a strange feeling. 
  The next weird thing was at the gate, we all scanned our passes and when she scanned mine I saw a new window pop up on the computer at the gate. The woman very quickly exited out of it, and her body language was also that of someone trying to hide an emotion or thought. 
  All in all, we got to our destination, but there were two instance today where new things happened that I have NEVER seen while traveling. 
   My question is that is there any chance that my reddit posts have lead to me being elevated towards some sort of no fly list?   Is there any chance that me speaking my mind here could lead to a revocation of. Y right to travel freely in my own country?  I don&#39;t know if I was able to convey the differences that happened today adequately, but as someone who has traveled hundreds and hundreds of items, it was pretty unnerving to have these new things happen that have never happened before. Thoughts?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What you experienced is extremely tame. It could have come down to an error. You would know if they actually suspected you of something. I don&#39;t think you have to be concerned about your freedom of domestic movement.</p>

<p>If you make an income from gambling that&#39;s more likely a trigger for the government than what you say online. Talk is cheap, but money buys weapons. Put the two together then maybe. I really don&#39;t think this is your case though. You still call your self &quot;a die hard patriotic American&quot; for starters.</p>

<p>Everyone is a suspect at this point. According to the legal definition of a terrorist, literally anyone can be a terrorist.</p>

<p>Everyone is on a watch list, because everyone is being watched. It&#39;s simply a matter of how high on the threat scale you are.</p>

He got his bag pulled but they didn&#39;t question or confiscate anything, then got held in a small group of people while everyone else boarded and was the last person on the plane. One of the airline people said something like &quot;are you serious&quot; before telling the group to go ahead onto the plane. Probably just chance.</p>
