US government is now populated with corporate CEO&#39;s, Banksters, Israel first zionist POS&#39;s and a complete assortment of corrupt criminal enterprising douchebags that are allowing, and most likely it is their agenda, to allow America to fall apart at the seams in every important aspect of maintaining a first world country. Education and infrastructure is crumbling to pieces...</p>

<p>America is only an afterthought to these people, to help out the people would mean they would have to divert money away from their scams, away from their satanic wars in the Middle East. If all the money that was spent on war in the last 15 years was spent on Education and infrastructure instead, America would be the most advanced country in the world...look at America now...pathetic what has been allowed to happen.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If the problem is that </p>

<blockquote>
<p>US government is now populated with corporate CEO&#39;s, Banksters,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then the solution is to depopulate it of those.</p>

<p>The first step to doing that is to recognize that the Republican Party has an <em>official platform</em> supporting unlimited money-speech in politics and has demonstrated that they will enforce this policy through 5-4 Supreme Court rulings -- against the wishes of the people. Further, the generalized deregulation agenda of Republicans encourages in many ways that the government is &quot;populated&quot; with these oligarchs. By supporting Republicans, or by believing that both parties are the same, the Republican agenda is rubber stamped.</p>

<p>On the other side, Democrats take all kinds of corporate money too. Nevertheless, Democrats have a demonstrated policy of opposing money in politics. In fact, the stealing of the Supreme Court seat by Donald Trump and the Republicans BLOCKED the reversal of this unlimited money corporate speech doctrine. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Democrats suck. There&#39;s no doubt that they are well inside the Establishment and that they love war.

<p>There are dissidents in the party and some are actually in power. That&#39;s what the whole Bernie Sanders thing is about. I don&#39;t see any serious dissidents in the Republican Party, and I don&#39;t find libertarianism to be a viable alternative.</p>

<p>The system is seriously screwed. The rise of Donald Trump is making it worse.</p>

<p>The thing that bugs me the most is how partisan Democrats have rushed to support MSM after Donald Trump declared it the &quot;enemy.&quot; Democrats have been lured like sheep into believing that MSM is on their side, and this is the most amazing psyop I&#39;ve ever seen -- even more so than 9-11. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s the opposite of my point.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t doubt that you see people praising the media when they hold a particularly corrupt opponent accountable for his words and actions, but the post you linked to also doesn&#39;t show democrats unquestioningly supporting the media, it just shows that they are now more than ever impressed that the media has the capability to track and oppose the immoral and potentially illegal actions of an authoritarian sitting president.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t defend anybody who says we should never question the motives of a news organization, but I also don&#39;t assume that praising a news organization for specific actions is somehow blanket support for the media!</p>

<p>To be fair, I am certain we would be far worse off without media, even without mainstream media. I prefer to put my money into local media that I perceive as less corporate and less corruptible, but I&#39;m not going to pretend that I&#39;d prefer a twitch-like stream of bloggers or a state run media conglomerate over current mainstream media.</p>

<p>Mainstream media might be the worst form of news dissemination... Except for all the others.</p>

You must be mistaking the voters on the left who oppose the internal policies of the Democratic party, for those who actually run it.
The current leadership in the DNC is EVERY BIT as controlled by a corporate agenda, as those on the right. that&#39;s why, when given the opportunity to reject corporate funding, they shot the idea down immediately, and have continued the fight to maintain corporate sponsorship as a cornerstone of the Democratic party.

    <div class="md"><p>You are simply incorrect. We can talk about <em>Citizens United</em> if you like, but I would hope most people know that my summary is correct. It is a basic fact that five Republicans on the Supreme Court overruled 100 years of campaign funding regulations, and four others (from both parties btw) opposed the deregulation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>To quote Nancy Pelosi....&quot;We are Capitalists, that&#39;s just the way it is&quot;.</p>

<p>This is lazy and misleading.</p>

<p>What is capitalism? It simply means that the means of production are owned by private people. Laissez-faire capitalism means there should be no regulations. No regulations means unlimited money in politics.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes Republicans gave us C.U., but establishment Dems have embraced it wholeheartedly, actually out playing the right at their own game.
Context on the Pelosi quote.-She was asked a question regarding the fact that younger voters have moved left regarding economics, and capitalism, about what the Democratic party might do to further embrace that sentiment. Her answer -&quot;We are Capitalists, that&#39;s just the way it is&quot; - basically amounts to &quot;Nothing, so shut up, and get on board.&quot;
Certainly not in line with the Liberal mindset some like to imagine exists within the DNC.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Seriously? You are going to try and use a state level decision from 2011 in Montana as an indicator for the current sentiment of the entire DNC?...
Sorry, but nope, that just doesn&#39;t cut it.
The fact remains that establishment Democrats have excelled at gaining corporate sponsorship, in many cases gaining more than their Republican counterparts. It is important to understand that since C.U. was passed, the general sentiment among the leadership on the left has been one of &quot;We will beat Republicans  at their own game, by using their own tactics against them&quot;. To a large extent, it has worked. This &quot;success&quot; has led to current party leaderships rejection of any attempts to disengage from that strategy.
When Senator Sanders tried to add a rejection of C.U. to the Democratic platform, it was soundly rejected by the corporate friendly Democrats currently in control of the party.
Again, not even close to the liberal ideals that many have been convinced the Democratic party still represents.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a United States Supreme Court decision, and the Wikipedia page has a section on that fact.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the dissent:</p>

<hr/>

<p>Justice Breyer, with whom Justice Ginsburg, Justice Sotomayor, and Justice Kagan join, dissenting.</p>

<p>In Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, the Court concluded that “independent expenditures, including those made by corporations, do not give rise to corruption or the appearance of corruption.” 558 U. S. <em>__, _</em>_ (2010) (slip op., at 42). I disagree with the Court’s hold-ing for the reasons expressed in Justice Stevens’ dissentin that case. As Justice Stevens explained, “technically independent expenditures can be corrupting in much the same way as direct contributions.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 67–68). Indeed, Justice Stevens recounted a “substantial body of evidence” suggesting that “[m]any corporate independent expenditures . . . had become essentially interchangeable with direct contributions in their capacity to generate quid pro quo arrangements.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 64–65).</p>

<p>Moreover, even if I were to accept Citizens United, this Court’s legal conclusion should not bar the Montana Supreme Court’s finding, made on the record before it, that independent expenditures by corporations did in fact lead to corruption or the appearance of corruption in Montana. Given the history and political landscape in Montana, that court concluded that the State had a compelling interest in limiting independent expenditures by corporations. 2011 MT 328, ¶¶ 36–37, 363 Mont. 220, 235–236, 271 P. 3d 1, 36–37. Thus, Montana’s experience, like considerable experience elsewhere since the Court’s decision in Citizens United, casts grave doubt on the Court’s supposition that independent expenditures do not corrupt or appear to do so.</p>

<p>Were the matter up to me, I would vote to grant the petition for certiorari in order to reconsider Citizens United or, at least, its application in this case. But given the Court’s per curiam disposition, I do not see a significant possibility of reconsideration. Consequently, I vote instead to deny the petition.</p>

<p>I am simply pointing out a demonstrated policy fact. It happens to be a very important one. The stealing of the Supreme Court seat <em>by Republicans</em> I say is the gravest harm to our system that we have seen since 2001. As a matter of fact, if HRC was in the White House, the odds that unlimited money-speech would have been overturned were extremely high. Four Justices, in a very unusual and bold dissent, pretty much said they would overturn it. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Tradition_Partnership,_Inc._v._Montana">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Tradition_Partnership,_Inc._v._Montana</a></p>

<p>If you go back in my history, you will see no campaigning for HRC whatsoever, and quite a bit of criticism. In those days, not so long ago, many were preaching &quot;anyone but Hillary.&quot; Now that Republicans have total power, we need to consider &quot;anyone but Republicans.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>which exists to divide people. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>As long as we look at libtards and conservatards, it probably is. But we are smarter than that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Most people share viewpoints from all over the political spectrum.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am not interested in discussing the political spectrum for the simple reason that the meanings of the words have been so totally distorted as to make conversation impossible. And here is how it happened. <a href="http://www.rationalrevolution.net/articles/redefining_the_political_spectru.htm">http://www.rationalrevolution.net/articles/redefining_the_political_spectru.htm</a></p>

<p>I am neither a libertarian nor a socialist. No ideology -- NO IDEOLOGY EVER -- is an answer to any problem. Full stop.</p>

<p>Bernie may try to make change from within, but the status quo will remain or he would be assassinated just like Kennedy was.</p>

<p>Our best hope- and if I voted it would have been Stein- is that Trump is trying to make changes from within- without letting the deep state realize it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t vote bc the entire voting apparatus is fraudulent- literally the voting machines are hacked and I&#39;m not comfortable with the idea that my vote was used for one party or the other to steal.  Who knows which candidiate got each person&#39;s vote?</p>

<p>No one will talk about what happened in the primary, almost like  it&#39;s too much to bear.</p>

<p>But people were switched, and video evidence proves that the machines will literally take a vote for a candidate and assign it to the other candidate.</p>

<p>No way was I prepared to put my stamp of approval on a system that could co-opt my most fundamental beliefs and steal them for
either trump or HRC, because I could not support either.</p>

<p>And I knew Deep state would steal Stein&#39;s votes and give to HRC.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hear this a lot, and agree in spirit, but unchecked capitalism will turn into what it has- just like unchecked socialism and communism turn into what they have.</p>

<p>Humans take advantage of weaknesses in systems.</p>

<p>I think government should be administered by computer.</p>

<p>We input a need: no job, for example, and and algorithm has already computed what a  human needs to live where they live that week and hands them that amount of money.</p>

<p>Or they commit a crime, and a computer algorithm that has been previously programmed hands them the appropriate punishment.</p>

<p>I think that is the only way to remove 1) ever increasing gov involvement, and 2) ever increasing gov corruption.</p>

<p>Which is our problem today.</p>

<p>The biggest issue here:  the programmers.  Because even that can be polluted.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So basically you propose giving a bit of cash for people to spend and setting the problem aside for a later time. Have you considered what would happen to prices? As people get more free cash (free not as in giving nothing in return but available), they will indeed want to spend it and it will inevitable raise the prices. It won&#39;t happen overnight but once prices get raised, some people will look the other way while others will take their place.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>1) I know it&#39;s not something you came up with but you proposed using the proposal; hence, my choice of words.</p>

<p>2) Is it though? Has anyone done any calculations how it would affect international trade if it were applied in the US or any other major country or union? Since prices will inevitably increase, I will dare to speculate and say that the amount of free money would have to increase over time which will increase prices even more and so on. What effects will it have on the global market is well beyond current conversation.</p>

<p>What I&#39;m trying to say is it doesn&#39;t address the problem which consists of multitude of factors - supply of jobs, geographic differences, possibility of outsource jobs, decrease of the value of certain specializations, culture of consumerism and so on. Throwing cash at people for them to spend is not sustainable in the long run.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are missing the point. I am all for increasing the quality of life for people and fixing neighborhoods that are ground zero for many nasty things. However, the point I&#39;m trying to make in one of my comments is that sooner or later prices will inevitably increase due to increased availability of free [read as available] cash. If all people have to pay higher price, then has there really been a change at all?</p>

<p>This principle is more or less universal and can be observed in many different areas of life. For example, free education. Not only the value of education will plummet since many more people will have effectively the same set of skills but also the quality of education will be decreased because it has to be dumbed down for slower people. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Free doesn&#39;t mean all inclusive in the educational sense.</p>

<p>&quot;Not only the value of education will plummet since many more people will have effectively the same set of skills&quot; - </p>

<p>I think this is quite the false statement.  It is still up to the individual to seek out and invest their time in those classes to better themselves.  Just because the education is free to attend doesn&#39;t mean everyone will grasp the concepts or pass the class.  Not everyone will seek higher education or greater understanding of every subject.  The only way everyone would have the same skill set would be if there was only a set of standard classes available and everyone was required to attend and grasp the concepts. </p>

<p>&quot;but also the quality of education will be decreased because it has to be dumbed down for slower people who have enrolled in their free classes.&quot;-</p>

<p>Again this is a ridiculous statement.  Not having to pay for a class does not mean the subject matter will have to change at all.  In fact due to the availability of free education it is most likely that the overall societal education baseline will rise leading to a greater common understanding of more advanced concepts.  If anything this would lead to innovation and a greater demand for your average American to be educated. </p>

<p>Opening up a program to a lot of people would effectively do the same. You can only have that many permutations. Chances are 80% of students will choose 20% of permutations and it will have more or less the same effect as having standard classes given enough time.  </p>

<p>Have you ever seen what happens to a university program that became almost 100% funded by the State? I have seen a few cases and I&#39;ve talked to prorectors of European universities. All of them experienced a decrease in quality because it&#39;s in their interests to get and keep as many students as possibly in order to get more cash. I&#39;m sure you can find an exception to the rule as with any thing but this is the baseline.</p>

<p>You talk about greater common understand of more advanced concepts. What concepts are you talking about? It sounds good on paper but chances are you don&#39;t need a university for that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If anything this would lead to innovation and a greater demand for your average American to be educated.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Can you show me an example where that&#39;s true?</p>

<p>I&#39;ll give you a hint. It&#39;s all about availability of cash and immediate need for a bigger party such as a large corporation or a State actor. Yes, now we are experiencing a movement of open sourcing all the things, but that doesn&#39;t generate you income except if you land a gig or get a job based on the open source project which is not what I&#39;m talking about.</p>

<p>Look, I understand the value of education and appreciate having a conversation with an educated person. Doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re intelligent though (not talking about this conversation). The biggest problem with free education is two-fold: market system and human psychology.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll start with the easier one. Humans appreciate free things much less than things they had to work for/pay for. It&#39;s a part of marketing theory and has been for quite some time. Most people will undervalue acquired knowledge. Some people, however, will hoard the knowledge. I&#39;ve talked to quite a few people that have at least 3 bachelors degrees, 2 masters degrees and are either working on their doctors degree or already have one. The most extreme case was with a person who had 4 bachelors, 3 masters and 2 doctors. He got them all basically for free and he is not a happy person. He has all this education but he can&#39;t land a fucking well paying job because it goes against his established pattern. He doesn&#39;t know enough -&gt; he&#39;ll get an education.</p>

<p>Onto the tough part - the market. Free education would work the best in a planned economy. You need more labor? Educated your students and off you go. That way you actually can get a job until you get laid off but having a job guarantee outweighs the risk. Under free market conditions you will get an education and then look for a job which will not be easy. The market changes very rapidly and the amount of information is just too much to handle for most people (I own a business dealing with this very issue) which is why they choose to plunge into the market with hopes and aspirations that will get broken. It requires planned efforts and most people don&#39;t have that.</p>

<p>How to fix all this? Stop making students go through all the bullshit courses because they have to pick one or more electives. Make universities class based instead of program based. Yes, programs offer some guidance in what you might need later on in life, but the established system is way too slow to react to market conditions.</p>

<p>When that&#39;s done, go a step further and make it 100% online based with real time collaboration between students and, if needed, offer to use university premises for students to meet up in person.</p>

<p>In other words, making education on-demand would fix that but it won&#39;t happen soon because the mechanism free universities have established to funnel money is too well created to be easily broken.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The goal isn&#39;t necessarily to supplement people who need things with free money, but rather to increase aggregate demand at the national level. If everybody in the country started spending an extra $200 every month, businesses have to increase output to keep up with demand. In order to increase output, businesses in turn have to increase spending on inputs, machinery, and most importantly, labor. When businesses all up and down the supply chain have to hire people to help meet demand, the aggregate increase in wages creates it&#39;s own increase in demand, allowing the government to reduce or eliminate the helicopter money now that the economy has reached a new equilibrium. </p>

<p>The classic example is world War II. The economy was in the great depression, the government started spending a metric fuckton of money on the war effort, then once the war was over we moved into some of the most prosperous years in our nation&#39;s history. The recovery had nothing to do with the fighting. If we had built all of those planes, guns and ships and buried them in a landfill, we still would have triggered a recovery due to the massive increase in demand that was driven by government spending on the war effort. Did it all crash down once the government stopped spending at wartime levels? No. Did prices rocket through the roof? Also no. We reached a new, higher level equilibrium of aggregate demand. Arguably we could do the same thing now with helicopter money.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your argument is based on an assumption there&#39;s a correlation between having more cash at hand and spending more and that aggregate demand will increase.</p>

<p>While there is a correlation, marginal utility will become flat(-ish) relatively soon because you can only buy so many things before not needing them any more. Plus you don&#39;t cover the fact that people might be saving the money to pay off their debts. If we&#39;re talking about the US, it&#39;s not an unfair assumption given that <a href="https://www.gobankingrates.com/personal-finance/data-americans-savings/">nearly 69% of adults have less than $1000 in their savings account</a> and <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/over-50-of-americans-struggle-with-home-affordability-2014-06-03">most have mortgages on their houses</a>. More money will go to businesses only after debt has been paid or, if we&#39;re being real, once people have sudden influx of cash they will become even more indebted. Cynical but realistic. The solution? Give more money to them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We&#39;ve already went down this road a few hundred years ago when factories began utilizing machinery to increase the productivity multiplier and after AI there will be other things that will put 75% of the workforce out of business. We&#39;ve experienced automation and look where we&#39;re now. People will have to specialize in other things and that&#39;s perfectly reasonable.

<p>You have no idea how it works, and the site you&#39;re linking too is giving half the picture and pretending it&#39;s a huge conspiracy that this free money exists. It doesn&#39;t.</p>

<p>Quantitative Easing is not free money, or a magical money tree. Every penny the banks get by issuing you a mortgage they don&#39;t have the money for has to be paid back at some point.</p>

<p>Imagine a different situation, imagine the bank as a person, Banky McBankFace. Banky always has money, but he&#39;s also constantly lending it out, spending it and getting new money to replace what he spent. One day you ask for a small loan, $10, but you promise to pay back $15 tomorrow, Banky says of course, but I don&#39;t have the cash on me right now, how about I write you a postdated check for tomorrow, just hand it over and everyone knows I&#39;m good for the cash and by tomorrow you&#39;ll have paid me back, so everyone is good, which you happily accept.<br/>
Banky now has a debt($10), and an asset(your promise to repay $15), net +$5. Now Banky has $5 more than he had before he goes out and buys lunch, of course he doesn&#39;t have $5, but he has a good promise from you to repay him that, so he explains this to the store, and they&#39;re happy to lend him $12 for lunch, on the condition that he gives them the $15 when he gets it. Banky is happy with $2 profit out of the day and happily accepts.<br/>
Meanwhile you go out and spend you cheque, obviously the cheque isn&#39;t good yet, but Banky&#39;s word is, so when you go to the store to buy lunch they happily accept Banky&#39;s cheque, after all they&#39;re doing all sorts of business with him and he&#39;s good for it, right.</p>

<p>So now Banky has $12 of real money, you&#39;ve got $10s worth of goods, and the $15 you owe is actually going to the store to pay off Banky&#39;s debt to them.<br/>
Well, the next day you repay your debt to Banky($15 giving him $27), and Banky goes to talk to the store, they&#39;ve got his IOU for $15 and the cheque for $10, and he happily pays them the $25 leaving him with $2 profit, the store with $3 profit, and you out $5(but you got to spend your money a day earlier for the fee).</p>

<p>At no point did the money magically appear, every penny that was spent had to be repaid. Quantitive Easing is this on a huge scale. Banks lend out millions they don&#39;t have to people on the condition they pay back more, sell off that potential profit to remain liquid and able to continue operating, and then at some point later down the line when everyone pays in their debts everything balances out.</p>

<p>If free money existed in the way that website implies the whole economy would have collapsed decades ago.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, the banks gave people loans they knew they couldn&#39;t pay back because the bank doesn&#39;t actually care(the bank sells on the debt, so you not paying becomes someone else&#39;s problem), eventually this caused a situation where people stopped wanting to buy the banks debts(known as toxic assets) and a bank that can&#39;t sell the debt can&#39;t run day to day and once a bank stops being able to operate people start panicking about how safe their money is and a bas situation becomes worse(not only can the bank not cover it&#39;s normal outgoings, but now it&#39;s got even more people wanting to take out the money the bank doesn&#39;t have on hand).</p>

<p>That should hopefully be resolved, there&#39;s regulations now that set up a situation where banks can&#39;t mis-sell assets any more(not to say that won&#39;t happen, but hopefully it shouldn&#39;t), and the government bought a bunch of the toxic waste for less than it was worth to free up the banks to start operating normally again.<br/>
Honestly there&#39;s no way to be sure this won&#39;t happen again as long as people are rewarded for making a profit on something that may not appear in a meaningful way until years later.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s the same idea, except instead of a cheque to be cashed later it&#39;s &quot;cash&quot; that they get by immediately accepting a debt to the government for the same amount under some strict rules(they need to keep a certain amount of funds liquid to do it, they can&#39;t do this with very high risk investments, the cash that they owe to the government has to be repaid within a short timeline, etc). All that really happens is the bank takes the cash from the government to &quot;create&quot; it, then covers this with the sale of the debts owed to the bank by the person getting the mortgage or small loan. (and not, as a certain financial institution got in a lot of trouble for doing, accepting a new debt to cover the old debt before it expires). The cash is created by the government, but only as long as it&#39;s paid back in very short order(at which point it stops existing again because the debt + asset of cash balances back out).</p>

<p>Most of the trillions that is going though the financial system though isn&#39;t fractional reserve, it&#39;s just not viable for the size of money being passed around from banks to banks for anyone to bother converting it to cash at each stage, instead it just exists as a chain of debt until it can be cashed in and everyone along the chain makes a small profit out of it(either at the time of selling on or off the back of the debt by not selling the whole debt on). Fractional reserve is used for your mortgage or business loan, </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s not even close to the same thing.</p>

<p>If you own a house and sell it to somebody, they take out a mortgage from a bank that has the ability to lend the money but doesn&#39;t really control but based on the assets of the bank would be able to liquidate inan emergency situation can lend. Charges an interest rate on money it technically doesn&#39;t have creates inflation.</p>

<p>If the banks had to pay out all the money they are lending at one time and at the same time everyone took their money out of the bank the banks would go bankrupt.</p>

<p>It&#39;s all based on the idea that not all the money will be needed all the time. If you have a backup of funds that can operate day to day functions of the bank and investment plus some emergency funds you can essentially run the industry on minimal funds without actually having physical cash to do it.</p>

<p>But if something major was to happen it&#39;s all fucked.</p>

<p>So it&#39;s a question of whether you take that risk and grow the economy and hope nothing bad happen, or play it safe and the economy grows slowly but safely.</p>

<p>Unfortunately everybody wants tons of money so you sacrifice safety for profit, hoping in the mean time you don&#39;t get screwed.</p>

<p>It&#39;s happens in every industry, and every once in a while someone takes a hit and goes bankrupt.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Say that I have no money and I take out a loan from a bank for $100 at 10% interest. At the end of the year, I have to pay back the bank $110, but I only have $100. In order to do this, I need to borrow money from another borrower. This then creates a problem for the other borrower; he too has to pay back $110 to the bank, but he only has $90, so he must borrow from yet another borrower. This problem propagates through the borrowers until eventually somebody goes bankrupt. Individual borrowers can pay the bank back the interest they owe by borrowing from other borrowers, but the borrowers as a collective cannot because the total amount they owe to the bank is more than the debt (loan) that the bank created in the first place. Thus, the bank has created money with the interest incurred by the loan.</p>

Sure loaning all the money in the world to one person doesn&#39;t make sense but you can replace &quot;one person&quot; with an arbitrarily large number of people and it would not change the math. . . . So now we have to print more money to pay back the interest, except the money printed is loaned to the government from central banks with an attached interest rate.  Then we need to borrow additional money from central banks to pay back that interest.  As you can see we are now stuck in a loop of borrowing more money to pay off interest on borrowed money.</p>

We are in a constant state of debt, to the magic money tree. How does that make sense? Simple. It doesn&#39;t. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Um, no.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve worked at secondary market desks for a mortgage lending side of a major bank and that money is being borrowed from a person, group, or institution that has the money to lend.</p>

<p>Look at your checking account paying .01% or your savings account paying .1% at Major Banks.   They have billions in deposit accounts just like yours.   They can lend that money at 4% and make millions.</p>

<p>Or they can work with Texas United Teachers Union Retirement with billions in retirement savings.  That pension group can get 2% return and agree on a 30 year payback and invest that in mortgages.  </p>

<p>Or Sovereign Wealth Of The Kingdom of Suad can invest in Mortgages and take a low risk investment in mortgages.</p>

<p>This is why the mortgage meltdown was so scary.   It wasn&#39;t just made up money.  It was billions of money belonging to a hugely diverse group ranging from banks, to kingdoms, to teachers, to people with 401k savings, etc.   It was Bernie Madoff institutionalized.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To clarify, I just looked into it again:</p>

<p>They define working age as between 30 and 64. I guess because people younger than 30 have a high likelihood of being only employed part-time, if they are employed at all, due to school. </p>

<p>&quot;So here&#39;s my test: What percentage of households aged 30 to 64 with per capita earnings in excess of $20,000 have either a 401(k) or IRA-style account, or entitlement to a traditional pension? The answer, according to the Survey of Consumer Finances, is 89 percent. That&#39;s nine out of ten, for those of you who don&#39;t like percentages.&quot;</p>

<p>Again, apparently, only 45% of people are actively contributing to those accounts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The government has been changing up how they calculate inflation.  Much of the QE has remained as entries in a bank, not getting out into the economy.  If it gets into the economy (which you propose) you would see corresponding inflation.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What? Quantitative easing has been the purchase of government bonds, dramatically increasing demand and pushing down interest rates across the board.</p>

<p>This lower interest rate has absolutely affected the economy as it makes it less profitable for banks to store money in us bonds, incentivizing them to extend loans to businesses and individuals at lower rates.</p>

<p>The reason we don&#39;t see much inflation is not because of changes in inflation calculations, although those do change slightly, but because businesses and consumers are still wary of taking risks and spending money, whether borrowed or earned. The effective money supply has remained low as banks and businesses across the board are willing to give up potential future gains for current safety.</p>

<p>As for changes in inflation calculations, they&#39;re really quite reasonable. The use of a geometric mean estimator simply accounts for the fact that consumers tend to substitute cheaper options as some items become more costly.</p>

<p>Furniture is a great example. It used to be hand crafted and overengineered out of beautiful hardwood. It was heavy, expensive and extremely durable.</p>

<p>Now the price of hardwoods has skyrocketed because we cut down most of the old trees and they take a long time to grow. We also have ultra low cost flat pack (Ikea) options that cost 20% or less.</p>

<p>Is my quality of life 80% lower now that I buy a dramatically cheaper option than even pine furniture? Is tracking the value of hardwood bookcases even relevant to the average urban consumer?</p>

<p>If beef prices rise 50% one year, supermarkets will sell a lot more chicken and pork which haven&#39;t shot up. Shouldn&#39;t we acknowledge that prices haven&#39;t increased significantly for the majority of people who are just as happy with a different meat?</p>

<p>There&#39;s no one right answer, but I&#39;d argue tracking the price of standard desktop PC is nearly meaningless unless you allow for substitutions for laptops, netbooks and even mobile phones. Otherwise you&#39;re not meeting the goal of CPI -- measuring changes in the prices for what people buy, not just static prices.</p>

<p>I also note that CPI very closely tracks MIT&#39;s billion price index -- tracking a huge number of easily aggregated online prices. I&#39;d expect a significant deviation when none is present in the data (certainly not on the order of multiple percentage points that would be covering up alleged inflation due to QE).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why money with no physical back works is because everyone believes money has value. That&#39;s the basic principle behind fiat currency. </p>

<p>However, it is also backed by the fact that (in the US) the US currency is legal tender, meaning if there is a debt you are legally required to accept US currency. Meaning if you owed me $1 and offer me a $1 in US currency I can&#39;t really refuse it. There are some notable exceptions, but in general it stands true.</p>

<p>As for if everyone wanted to take their money out of the bank. Well, assuming there was enough actual cash made (there isn&#39;t) they would get all their money. In reality since there isn&#39;t enough cash they shut down the bank and tell people they aren&#39;t able to take out their money. It&#39;s call a &quot;Bank run&quot; and it usually happens somewhere around the globe every couple of years. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Except the government can always make more physical cash if people decided they wanted all their money in physical cash. Madoff did not have that ability. Regardless, you are completely of base with your thinking. You are welcome to criticize a fiat system due to the fact that the currency has no backing, but the idea that fiat currency is a pyramid scheme (also, the phrase you are looking for in Ponzi scheme) is flawed. A dollar does not derive it&#39;s value from being a piece of cotton paper with ink on it. It derives it&#39;s value from the fact that people will exchange it for something, regardless of whether that physical dollar is there or not. Why would stores accept credit cards if the value was only in the physical money? </p>

<p>Are you serious ?</p>

<p>Because it just represent real cash money dude...</p>

<p>Just as cash money was meant to represent something real and valuable.</p>

<p>And that&#39;s where the problem lies, cash is now only representing cash and its value is only based on what people agree it to be. It&#39;s like money has become something on its own.</p>

<p>Thus, we entered a perpetual forward flee... In order to keep it valuable, it has to worth lesser and lesser over time...</p>

<p>So imagine you get paid 5 bottles of water for a job. You drink one of them. One year later, you&#39;re left with 4 bottles of water.</p>

<p>Now, if you get paid &quot;the value of 5 bottles of water in cash&quot;... You buy one bottle and drink it. One year later, you&#39;re left with less than the value of 4 bottles of water.</p>

<p>Do you realize now ? Yes, you were right... Speculative money doesn&#39;t come out of nowhere... It&#39;s actually slowly sucking value out of everything else while producing no goods nor services.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>It does not represent cash, it creates a deposit, which is exchangeable for cash. Which is an important distinction in the context of the discussion I was having. The idea that money can exist without a physical form is a hugely important concept.</p>

<p>Regardless, your point, while valid, is entirely different than the previous fellow&#39;s point. You did miss something though, which is that having fiat currency fixes a problem that all physically back money. Fiat money solves the problem of the availability of money. There is no physical substance that is both valuable due to intrinsic properties that is common enough to be used to back the amount of currency that is needed. So, while we do have inflation we are also not falling into stagnation due to the fact that no one has any money to use. </p>

<p>The &quot;value&quot; is the ability to exchange it for goods and services. My barber accepts cash because it allows him to buy groceries. His grocer accepts cash because it allows him to buy clothes. His tailor accepts cash because it allows him to buy a house.</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t think cash has value, feel free to turn all your cash into some other asset. The beauty of money is that you can! And there&#39;s no shortage of people willing to accept your cash for actual &quot;valuable&quot; assets.</p>

<p>Thats what the bank is for. You put your gold in the bank and write a check or use a debit card and the bank would take care of the physical transfer.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Is this bar you&#39;re holding real gold, or are there tungsten bars hidden inside of it</p>

<p>That is what an XRF machine is for. I&#39;d assume the bank would carry those if the economy were gold based. Many jewelry stores have them as well. </p>

<p>I&#39;m sure if more people purchased them the price of each XRF unit would go down and be affordable.</p>

<p>Are you serious? An impure bar of gold is way more valuable than the equivalent amount in paper money.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem was the amount of liquidity needed for the swaps that happened with AIG.  It was a zero sum game.  My take on it is that instead of fines induced on companies for gross negligence, they should fine them in ownership.  Take 1% from each owner to the new owner&#39;s equity.  If they are not a public company, they can either do a buyout of that 1%+ to those affected or something similar.  This would stop ignorance more than what they did.  Citigroup and AIG ended up fine but their gross negligence in managing those swaps were awful.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Basically, it is like if you have a doctor and a movie star both have salaries.  The movie star wants to stabilize his salary so he decides to enter an agreement with a few doctor&#39;s salary to swap his salary to stabilize his income.  The movie star loses his career and cannot find a job and goes bankrupt.  Luckily, in the agreement, there was a required insurance on the salary.  Suddenly, the doctors are out of money and they cannot run their business because they don&#39;t have any sort of salary so they all claim their insurance on the movie salary at once to save themselves except the insurance company cannot pay everyone at once so they either go bankrupt as well as all the doctors. </p>

<p>There is a really good book called Physhing for Fools that has a great chapter on what happened.  It has a great amount of other &quot;scams&quot; that have happened and a lot of information that is really a great read.  But this kind of stuff gets more complicated.  This is what happened and in a sense why the US needed to bail them out and why 12 trillion was needed.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It bordered a racket.  The main reason is that the doctor&#39;s salary (Cash flow) may be better for the expenses of the movie star and vice versa.  There is also likely a tax advantage as well but I don&#39;t know.  There is a portfolio theory too where you could do a mix of different cash flows so that you create a balanced and stable salary if it is highly variable.  Like a cold/flu doctor whose money is made in the winter but is dry in the summer but he still needs money to keep his business afloat.  He could take a portion of the Movie star&#39;s salary as a way to ensure expenses can be paid and he does not have to worry about saving as much money for the summer season.</p>

<li>That&#39;s why issues like abortion keep coming up, easy dividing topic. </li>

<li>Why keep marijuana banned? Easy to get old voters on your side by calling it devil&#39;s herb. </li>
<li>Why don&#39;t we fix the healthcare and eliminate the middleman, who is simply there to pocket money? Because it keeps us divided. Fuck your neighbor! Those extra few cents I would pay on my paycheck is mine! Even though if we all paid that extra bit, <em>everyone</em> would have healthcare. <em>Everyone</em> would be healthier. But usually healthier means smarter and happier, and you can&#39;t use fear tactics as easily.</li>
<li>Why would we actually try to solve international problems diplomatically with all parties? Why not just pick a side and bomb the other! That way we get some $$ and act like we&#39;re patriotic and defendin&#39; freedom.</li>

    <div class="md"><p>You folks are pretty lucky.  It&#39;s literally life and death here in the U.S.<br/>
&quot;Obamacare&quot; was labeled as scary &quot;<em>Socialism</em>!!&quot; but in reality was a huge giveaway to insurance companies.<br/>
Got better for a very brief period, now most insurance rates have skyrocketed again.  Even company plans for employees suck worse now.  Employees have to pay much higher percentages, for much worse insurance packages.  (Example:  Employer deducts a percentage of employee&#39;s pay each week for insurance plan, but the employee still has to pay $5,000 to $10,000 out of pocket for medical treatment before insurance kicks in.)<br/>
Finally, it&#39;s keeping natural allies divided -- working class are envious of poor because they can get some insurance.  At the same time, the working class usually can only purchase insurance either as individuals or through work --- and either way, its verrrrrry expensive and often doesn&#39;t end up covering whatever illness arises.<br/>
<strong>It&#39;s not a health care system, it&#39;s a disgusting criminal enterprise.</strong></p>

<p>I hear about $800 for a ride in the ambulance?  Your local hospital may not be included in your insurance plan?  Upwards of several thousand dollars a month for medication?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That ambulance price is for real.  Even if you are on Medicare (that&#39;s U.S. healthcare for people over 65 - funded out of payroll taxes).  About ten years ago, my mom needed an ambulance and when we got the bill for $675 I couldn&#39;t believe that Medicare didn&#39;t cover it!<br/>
And yes, people are getting used to the idea that they have to factor in the cost of an ambulance in the decision on whether to use one or not.  <em>Can I risk it?   Do I really need medical attention on the way to the hospital or should we just try to get there on our own and see if we make it?</em><br/>
This particularly hits hard on people who are struggling financially, but do have some assets. Because the debt collectors will come after them, and after them.<br/>
Conversely, if you are poor enough, then you don&#39;t have to pay.  So, once again, it pits the working class against the poor.  </p>

<p>Outside of going to places specifically to shoot or buy guns and hanging out with friends, I&#39;ve seen maybe 10 visible handguns not counting cops.  Just regular folks at restaurants or buying groceries that happened to being open carrying a handgun.</p>

<p>There&#39;s definitely a cultural difference.  The idea of seeing someone at a restaurant with a gun on their hip probably sounds absurd to you.  The idea of not being able to carry a pocket knife or own a handgun sounds absurd to me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, I&#39;m not taking it the wrong way - you&#39;re just being rational.  It wasn&#39;t always like this.<br/>
Back in the mid to late 80&#39;s the price of insurance wasn&#39;t so bad, and it was fairly easy to get through your job.  Now, whether you buy it through your job, or on your own, it&#39;s really very expensive AND more people have to pay a <em>huge</em> <em>deductible</em> before the insurance even kicks in.<br/>
Here&#39;s how the deductible works: on a regular basis, you pay the insurance company for your medical insurance coverage.    But before they&#39;ll pay for medical expenses, you have to pay the first $5,000 or $10,000 (or more, depending on the insurance plan that you choose.)<br/>
And God forbid you didn&#39;t buy the insurance through your job or through some other sort of group coverage.  If you buy insurance as an individual, the insurance company is MUCH more likely to reject any claims you make.  Why?  <em>Because you&#39;re just one little person.  What are you gonna do about it sucker!</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>God forbid you have to be airlifted somewhere - good luck paying that bill.  </p>

<p>One thing that bothers me the most about for-profit health care in the US is that you can never truly trust what you are being told.  Every person in that industry has a motivation or requirement to screw you over (as with all things in capitalism), or least give advice/treatment/medicine that you may not need at all.  </p>

<p>For example, if I do to the doctor for a given problem and there are two treatment options - one being less expensive than the other - which option do you think they will go with?  Obviously, if there is more profit to be made from one option, even if that option is not necessarily ideal for the issue at hand, that is probably what they will recommend.  </p>

<p>Before anyone burns me down, I know I made some blanket statements here and I know that isn&#39;t really true.  There are plenty of good folks in the healthcare industry and they aren&#39;t all out to get you.  That said, when there is a profit motive that means, at least some of the time, that profit is being put ahead of the care being administered.  </p>

<p>My Mom has been a nurse for over 40 years now, keep in mind, so this sentiment is despite my personal connection to the industry.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I definitely envy those of you out there who don&#39;t have to make these considerations in times of crisis.  </p>

<p>I remember one time during a meeting with my company&#39;s health care provider they actually had a whole section on what to do in a crisis to make sure you are covered.  For example, if you are in need of a life-saving operation you have to make sure that not only the facility you are going to is in-network, but also the doctors who will be working on you.  It is completely insane.  </p>

<p>If I have a heart attack they expect me to get on the phone with their customer service team while I am in the process of dying to source providers that they will cover under my plan.  Keep in mind, I always get the best possible health care plan but even then you have hoops to jump through.  </p>

It was a surgical procedure and, while the dental office I went to was covered for dental procedures, they were not covered for surgical procedures.  I ended up having to pay for the whole thing out of pocket.  I wasn&#39;t well off financially at the time so I had to finance the whole thing.  All told, it cost me a couple grand.  </p>

I think the same thing would happen in the US (company would call an ambulance for liability reasons) but the person and/or their insurance company who end up footing the bill.

    <div class="md"><p>I think the average cost per day in the US is about $2,000 USD.  So, four weeks would have cost about $56,000 USD.  With insurance the out of pocket cost would have been a lot less depending on the plan.  That said, if you have a $10,000 deductible then that is what you would have been on the hook for.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;<strong>The Crying Room</strong>&quot;: A friend’s girlfriend used to be a health insurance customer service agent.  The insurance company rigorously trained them on how to delay and/or deny treatment or the payment of claims. These lowest paid people on “the front lines” of the insurance industry were not heartless, but if they resisted company directives, their jobs were put at risk.</p>

<p>If an insurance company denies approval for treatments, or even delays approval, that can mean life or death.  This is brutal.    </p>

<p>Imagine being the person who listens to these people’s stories over and over, every day.  And then you have to tell these desperate people no, once again.   And maybe that means their husband or mother or child may die because treatment is delayed.</p>

<p>Anyway, my friend’s girlfriend said that every day, people broke down because it was unbearable.  And they would rush to the bathroom to sob. This was &quot;the Crying Room&quot;.  There was always at least one person, if not more, crying in the bathroom. These customer service reps aren’t psychopaths or sociopaths.  (If they were, they would have their own nice offices, fat paychecks and executive titles.)  These customer service reps are just normal people trying to make a living.  Maybe they have kids.  Maybe they really need the health insurance that the job provides.  So they go through this emotional and mental torture every day, all day long.  Either deny coverage to people who have paid for it, or lose your job.  And if you lose your job, then you might end up on the other end of the phone begging for help.   </p>

Then, the first $5000 of the family&#39;s medical bills have to be paid out of pocket for each calendar year. Only then does her insurance kick in, but she still has to pay co payments for each doctor visit or prescription. And she only makes about $45K per year. </p>

<p>Oh, and the best part? For two years in a row now, once she has met that $5,000 out of pocket max for the year, the insurance company tends to deny any big procedures right off the bat, so the don&#39;t have to pay for it. Her doctor wanted her to get an MRI because she lost all hearing in one ear rather suddenly (and he wanted to rule out a brain tumor or tumor on the auditory nerve). Denied. Still fighting with the insurance company to get it covered, two months later.</p>

<p>First off, you are wrong on every single count. NHS doesn&#39;t see for all things you think you pay for. Plus, the Reason the UK left the EU is because of dumb ass shit like medical care coverage that nobody can afford.</p>

<p>As for Obama care, it has almost no major providers, some state&#39;s exchanges are not even in business any longer since the costs to the insurers is multiple times what the exchange pays back.</p>

<p>0bama is a one-world gov&#39;t CIA plant, same as his mother Stanley Dunham, a CIA asset. 0bamacare was never supposed to work, as evidenced by Rep. Pelosi&#39;s comments on it.</p>

<p>The problem in the US is that the politicians long ago learned who to serve first. In our current system the biggest companies, which are legally recognized as people in our courts so that they may have constitutional rights, these &quot;persons&quot; donate far more to campaigns than regular &quot;blokes&quot; like me ever could or would. Thus a voice like mine, it&#39;s very quiet to the ear of a politician. </p>

<p>We&#39;ll have universal healthcare one day, but it won&#39;t be for the little people. It&#39;ll be just like it is right now, for the &quot;big&quot; people i.e. the loudest voices monetarily speaking. </p>

Part of that comes down to the alchohoism and obesity, the rest is the fact that the republicans chief donor is Pfizer (big pharma) and the rest is a lack of public will. The idea of civil service is basically dead here, even among the left. </p>

<p>The idea of health and education being for societal benefit rather than self benefit are probably why social health and education haven&#39;t yet caught on here. I found this video quite informative
<a href="https://youtu.be/YcZXbfp1oRk">https://youtu.be/YcZXbfp1oRk</a></p>

<p>In addition, the forms of social healthcare we have implemented have been disasterous (look up VA scandals and kidney dialysis). In addition, because Medicare/caid cannot negotiate drug prices, we are overcharged hundreds of billions of dollars annually (much of the defecit) for drugs. This is a part of the high insurance costs.</p>

<p>Paying another £50/week would still be less than the ~£6000 or $9000+ cost of us health care.</p>

<p>Also houses are much better built in the UK as well. That&#39;s just something that you don&#39;t here much but boy is it true.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First of all, you can&#39;t convince people to vote to cut their medicaid and medicare. The benefit to having insurance companies is the argument of a fiscally conservative government who lets the free market do its work. The alternative is not that you will pay a few pennies more, it&#39;s that your taxes will literally double. We pay 40% to 50% income tax here in Canada, we have carbon taxes, technology taxes, sales taxes. At the lowest bracket of income its still way more than US tax.

<p>Hah, no you don&#39;t. I work in Canada/Alberta, my tax rate is less than it was in MN. While the average tax rate is a bit higher, it&#39;s not 40-50%, US average sits at 26% while Canada&#39;s average sits at ~31%. Specifically, MN is near 30% (Fed+State), Alberta is 29% (Fed+Prov). <a href="http://blog.citizenscode.org/2016/04/27/canada-how-much-income-tax-you-pay/">Here&#39;s the Data</a>. Taking the Average Canadian Salary of <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/wealthiest-1-earn-10-times-more-than-average-canadian-1.1703017">$76k</a> (80k we&#39;ll say), Quebec sits at 32.8%, all the way down to Nunavut at 24.3%. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>we have carbon taxes, technology taxes, sales taxes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes sales tax is more <em>in some provinces</em> and carbon tax is on industries for pollution contributions.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Not to mention we pay more for everything because our dollar is weak</p>
</blockquote>

<p>CAD is weak but Canadian salaries are generally higher. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_income">USD equiv purchasing power of each household</a> remains relatively equal between Canada and the US.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>taxed too high so companies dont move here</p>

<p>Partially true, they usually move to the country that has the most lax rates or most rule loopholes, which Canada keeps their corporate rates modest (lower than the US), they actually have fewer loopholes so the effective tax rate is higher. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_tax_rates">Canada is 15% + 11-16% local, US is 35% + 0-12% local.</a></p>

<p>The US could <em>easily</em> pay for universal healthcare if the lawmakers put their minds to it, but since it can keep the nation divided and unhappy, why not keep the troops riled up and fighting each other?</p>

<p>Those all factor into the media rates above. The data is from the last few years, nothing major has changed in either tax code recently.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>disadvantaging the poor.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If it&#39;s a fair rewrite, this will affect the rich much more, as that is how they avoid those large tax rates of 40%+ at 200k income. They write off a lot of it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, your Donald Trump is going to pass another tax cut?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On the rich, he&#39;s already increased taxes on middle income by raising mortgage insurance rates. He can&#39;t cut taxes by himself, and the deep cuts he&#39;s proposing so far haven&#39;t floated well with Congress.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The US has <a href="https://taxfoundation.org/capital-gains-rate-country-2011-oecd/">one of the lowest Capital Gains taxes in the world</a>, without even factoring in the loopholes that some are trying to close. They haven&#39;t been increased in years and should be increased, as the amount of money that goes through Wall Street is insane. Money is being made off of speculation, and if investors destroy the economy like they helped to do in 2008, they face few repercussions. </p>

<p>The economy is not brittle, maybe after a few years of deregulation we will be, but currently the US economy is strong.</p>

<p>We aren&#39;t all going to lose our jobs if capital gains taxes increase. If anything it&#39;ll make the economy less volatile by limiting the speculation (more cost to speculate = less speculation).</p>

<p>And I agree, we do need to rework our tax code and healthcare, but not in the deregulation sense, but rather smarter, less &#39;holey&#39; tax code. Deregulation got us into the 2008 mess, we don&#39;t want to see that again.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>According to Bernanke in his NPR interview recently, and macroeconomic analysts, we are on the verge of another crash. Regulation stifles growth, and the elimination of regulation will make us all better off. Bank and mortgage collapses are due to individuals borrowing money they have no business borrowing and people trying to buy homes instead of renting because they consider their home an investment instead of a place to live. Smarter consumers means less bad loans. People need to be smarter and most haven&#39;t forgotten about 2008 so I don&#39;t think there will be another problem like that.</p>

<p>The future is coming...Fast.  And these current systems cannot manage the increase of connectivity, sharing of ideas and problem solving without resorting to the old tried and true divide amd conquer tactics.  </p>

<p>As some off the cuff examples:</p>

<p>An emergent democracy based on blockchain voting and distribution of a mix of mandatory and voluntary taxes for the general welfare provided by agile cooperative and transparent agencies is a possibility.  </p>

<p>Interlinked communities of interest and efficient distribution and delivery of essential goods and services on a global scale is also possible.  </p>

<p>The acknowledgment and enforcement of individual rights and liberties paired with citizen duties is also possible and sustainable in perpetuity should even a small scale organization prove superior to the dominant order.  </p>

<p>Rapid and effective response to any emergency with the preservation of life and liberty being the motive is also possible. </p>

<p>Laws are written and zealously enforced to prevent alternatives to the political and economic system (s) from arising to compete.  It&#39;s an ongoing process.  </p>

<p>However many brilliant minds work on these fundamental problems, though in a vacuum surrounded by a void and hidden by a sphere of distractions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re right, you need both. The leaders of these movements are often middle or upper class. However, you need far more of one than the other. There only needs to be a few leaders to organize and fund, but there needs to be thousands of discontented rabble willing to fight. There&#39;s a reason most of the modern-day violent uprisings tend to happen in the poorest nations.</p>

<p>No, the best way to prevent rebellion is to keep the masses complacent. Feed them, give them a comfortable lifestyle, and make sure they have something to lose if they ever make the wrong decisions. Maybe give them internet so they can watch cat videos all day or post about how corrupt the government is on Reddit while being too apathetic to actually try to do anything about it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When the latitude of free expression is constrained by a code of behaviour backed by violence, and this is tolerated for generations, what results are people who are generally unable to think outside of the box, and generally unwilling to do so for the social consequences.  It&#39;s made worse when the code of behaviour is badly designed.  What you see now is what you get.  Most people are unable to parse things that are outside of their experience.  This especially applies to bureaucrats and apparatchiks.  So, as I said earlier.  What you see is what you get.  </p>

<p>One way of correcting this fundamental social design error that we&#39;ve perpetuated for the monarchy/priesthood-class is to coalesce along lines of conformity.  The conformists will kill themselves off anyway defending their priests - that&#39;s just how stupidly constrained they are.  The others will, ideally, try to avoid these people.  </p>

<p>The other problem to note is that free will necessitates that the set of all opinions will not be compatible with one another.  So who gets to decide what opinion is right?  Well, nobody, really.  We should just fract ourselves out along lines of different opinion, and to organize our systems of collective management around that, in a spectrum.  That means no single global gov.  If there are to be any global rules, they should be meta-rules like &quot;be polite&quot;, or language-rules that everyone can agree on so that communication is facilitated.  Also, having a common design language would help us articulate our systems designs to the cohort such that we don&#39;t get caught up in the DSL jargon trap we have now with the legal system.  It&#39;s all solvable - the barrier to putting these solutions in play are TPTB themselves.  We have shitty rulers, and they&#39;ve made it so that we always have to play in their systems of shitty rules.  Well, we really don&#39;t.  Removing oneself from the gov tit is doable, and doable on scale.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My perspective on this is strongly anti-capitalist, but give me a chance.</p>

<p>First define capital, from Latin capítulo, meaning head, short for a year of cattle, today it usually means wealth that can be transferred (bought, sold, traded).</p>

<p>So now ask yourself is a free person capital?  Is a slave capital?  Is a dead person capital.</p>

<p>Imagine a cave.  If someone has been living in it for a thousand years is it capital?  Depends on whether the people in it are willing to sell to you, but what if they died?</p>

<p>Say there is a large vein of copper made inaccessible by a large population living above it.  Can you really consider that copper capital (remember usability and transferability are important) until that population is relocated or destroyed?</p>

<p>We need air and water so much they are such basic necessities of life we have a hard time considering them capital, but what if there were no more people to fight you when you tried to &quot;buy&quot; the whole planets water supply, or air supply.  What if the people are out of the way though?  When you don&#39;t need people to control the planets resources anymore (drones and automation replace them), then the only impediment to considering the entire planet a piece of capital that could potentially be owned by a single, fallible, self interested individual, is the fact the planet is inhabited.</p>

<p>Thankfully our champion capitalists, like Elon Musk, already are well into development of subterranean systems, and the means to survive in hospital atmospheres.  Perfect tools to protect yourself during a total depopulation of the earth.  At which point it becomes capital, and the capitalist left after becomes the greatest champion of capitalism to ever have lived, because now he owns a business of a planet that he can send his drones to harvest as he pleases, and under capitalism this is very good, because since he is the one with the most resources, it means he is best equipped to allocate it (hence why interfering with capitalists allocation of capital through taxation and regulations is bad).  Of course he is the last one left, so if he makes a single mistake the entirety of civilization, possibly a good chunk of the progress of evolution, could be reset to nothing.</p>

<p>Sound like a good plan to you?  This is the logical extension of capitalism (acquire the most capital), and from this perspective the spending priorities you are complaining about make perfect sense.</p>

<p>Depopulation is a necessary part of increasing your holdings, because at a certain point you cannot accumulate more resources without collecting resources others need to live (accessible resources are finite), and those whose survival is threatened by you collection of capital, will more than likely be willing to give their lives to interfere with your collection of capital.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very true, but what form the depopulation/capitalization of the earth takes doesn&#39;t matter to me.  Who gets extracted from the chaos doesn&#39;t matter to me.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t change the motivations, and it doesn&#39;t significantly mitigate the risk to life and civilization that comes with putting all your eggs in one basket.  So I really don&#39;t care.  I could be the first one in line for extraction, and it would make no difference to me.  It could be the most humane depopulation possible (perhaps simply indoctrinating people not to have children) I would still die to stop it, though not kill.</p>

<p>So I really don&#39;t care, but of course you are right, just murdering everyone would be stupid.  Ideally (for them) half the population would work the other half to death as slaves, and then repeat, or something like that, don&#39;t you think?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know enough about the cutting edge of automation to say how many people it would take to fully manipulate the earths resources, but your range sounds good.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And what percentage of those employed hate their jobs?  How many people are trapped in a system whereby they do shitty work, that makes the shareholders and owners rich, while their entire existence is controlled and manipulated by others just in order to meet their basic needs?

    <div class="md"><p>A lot of people hate their jobs, but that is not always a good metric. A person making 500K a year could hate their job more then i hate my $9 an hour job.  People could quit and ban together to do their own thing, then they will not be making any shareholders or owners rich, but they don&#39;t. I would still rather be a poor american now then a king in the 1700s, because I like things like AC, highspeed internet, food variety, cars, not dead because of a cold, ect.</p>

Because you say you want it to be better for those at the bottom and worse for those at the top, but our government is the one on top.

    <div class="md"><p>What i meant by its life is, life is unfair. You just have to learn to move on from the unfairness. And yeah I get that. I owned a business for two years and taxes took 55% of what I made. So as a business owner it&#39;s hard to pay a decent wage due to taxes and inflation. As soon as they raise the minimal wage inflation goes up and the cycle starts again. The only way to stop this cycle is to cut back on taxes and for some good honest business owners to lower prices. With lower taxes and lower prices you get theoretically the same profit allowing better pay for employees. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I read an article about a pvc company that wanted to install new pipes in flint for free but can&#39;t get approval because of some law... Found the article. They want to donate all the pipe they would need but leaders in Flint want copper pipe plus there is a law prohibiting the use of pvc, probably was passed some time ago when plastic wasn&#39;t a good alternative to copper. Times have changed though. Cronyism?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a good article.  I don&#39;t understand why Flint officials haven&#39;t acted on this offer.  If its true that city regulations do not allow for the use of plastic pipe (while nearby towns actually use it), then they need to change the regs!<br/>
Its astonishing how, in a supposed representative democracy, people act is if laws (and regulations) are written in stone.  If they suck, <em>change &#39;em!</em>  (Anyway, good comment.)</p>

Feeding the poor is too over budget?<br/>
The starvation rate in the US is 0%.  In 1990 we spent 20 billion on food stamps, it&#39;s now around 70 billion, over 300% increase.  The biggest expenditure the &quot;poor&quot; use their food stamps for is Mountain Dew and Monster drinks.  So this is bullshit.<br/>
Not enough money to fix Flint&#39;s pipes?<br/>
The water was deemed safe almost a year ago.   Flint Michigan, the State of Michigan the the federal government has give several hundred million dollars over the last several years.  All the money is there, by a WIDE margin to fix the Flint issue.    So this is bullshit.</p>

<p>But the awful truth of the matter behind poverty is it is a created and managed state, as is the emotional programming that causes us to despise the poor.  All of that is mind control through cultural indoctrination passed down by those fucktard Puritans.  The solution?  Get off your moral high horse and just give them cash, it works much better than piecemeal programs and there&#39;s data to back that up:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, the answer to solving government corruption is to not give them more authority to force people to fork over more money to &quot;fix&quot; society&#39;s problems (AKA &quot;feeding the poor&quot;). That should be left up to the people to take care of through voluntary participation. </p>

<p>We can both agree though that the military budget <em>could</em> be cut, but we can afford to keep it this way. It&#39;s easy to look at the raw numbers and think we are spending way too much but in reality it stays within 3-5% of our GDP, which is what most other countries do. </p>

<p>North Korea&#39;s and Saudi Arabia&#39;s raw military budgets are much lower than ours, for example, but the % of GDP they spend is massive in comparison. It&#39;s all about perspective. But yes, we could easily take advantage of our economic superiority and slash the military budget in half (as well as our inflated welfare programs) and still be more powerful than all other countries on Earth. That money could be used to fix infrastructure or pay down debts, which is what we need the most.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For the sake of a hypothesis. Let&#39;s support the opposite.</p>

<p>Groups of people get together and create and identity. This later grows to become a nation</p>

<p>Nations then realise that bartering isn&#39;t an efficient method, so they invent the concept of a currency, and is based on a physical value, or not.</p>

<p>Now these groups of people intend to trade amongst each other. And somewhere down the line, the possession of money got related to possession of value. The more money, the more the value. And this money was sent down to your kids.</p>

<p>Then come the banks, they decide to give you a small rate for keeping your money with them. Simultaneously, if you are of value, you may be able to borrow money worth x times your value, where x is typically &gt; 1. </p>

<p>Now, to protect these systems, you would most probably protect things of higher value. This is because the loss of something with high value is a bigger hit to the nation, rather than lots of things of lesser value. Therefore it is essential to protect high value things</p>

<p>So now people with money can borrow more money, and leverage to earn more money. However, a guy without anything has nothing that can be turned into a liability, therefore is infinitely difficult for him to earn</p>

<p>Therefore, the ease at which you can earn an extra unit of a particular currency is exponentially easy as you have more. Inversely, it is exponentially hard to earn when you very little.</p>

<p>Given that this is how the system is, how/what do you change it to?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was specifically criticizing OP&#39;s attempt to frame the argument as though America&#39;s people are neglected due to the largesse of military spending when in reality America has achieved the highest standards of living in the world. I&#39;m generally against the mil. Ind. complex, Ike said it best in his famous speech. That said, posts claiming that we could create paradise on earth If we spent less on military are completely naive. The reason we have so much money is because of our military. It&#39;s used as a bargaining chip in dealings with nations that need protection, it prevented us from becoming a part of USSR, and it has insured dominance of the dollar long beyond its natural course. Again I&#39;m generally against it, but I fully understand that a weakening of our military will not magically solve all of our problems, let alone sensationalized problems that don&#39;t even exist.</p>

<p>&quot;The real difficulty is with the vast wealth and power in the hands of the few and the unscrupulous who represent or control capital. Hundreds of laws of Congress and the state legislatures are in the interest of these men and against the interests of workingmen. These need to be exposed and repealed. All laws on corporations, on taxation, on trusts, wills, descent, and the like, need examination and extensive change. This is a government of the people, by the people, and for the people no longer.

    <div class="md"><p>Well your nuke point is kind of nonsensical. </p>

<p>Indeed if the government didn&#39;t use money on building, storing and keeping nukes ready to launch at any time it would have more money for other tasks.</p>

<p>The issue that the current relative world peace is held together more by the threat of mutual destruction due to everyone having their own nukes to launch at the other rather than by all countries being satisfied and friendly with each other.</p>

<p>So yeah maybe the pipes would get fixed if all the nukes got abandoned. But that might also lead to a huge imbalance in the world&#39;s geopolitics possibly escalating to war.</p>

<p>Now I don&#39;t know what your priorities are. Broken pipes suck for sure. But I&#39;m gonna say that another world war or another country taking advantage of another one because the first one has nukes and the other doesn&#39;t because it decided to fix pipes sucks even more.</p>

<p>The system as a whole sucks since it&#39;s built on the possibility of mutual destruction which is unstable af but it&#39;s better than the alternative you&#39;re suggesting.</p>

<p>Flint Mayor Karen Weaver has pledged to dig up and replace the city’s almost 30,000 lead service lines, but so far only about 700 have been replaced. Weaver blames the slow pace on inclement weather and a lack of state funding. At the town hall last week, officials said it could take up to three years for a complete overhaul.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, maybe. The Cold War built up a lot of social and political momentum that has proven very difficult to dismantle. If nuclear weapons didn&#39;t exist the Cold War would have become a hot war and would have been World War III. So, we avoided that.</p>

<p>But the aftermath of a 50 year long Cold War is that we have an absolutely gigantic standing army and a legion of contractors who care for and feed that army.</p>

<p>We need to make no mistake that the biggest waste of money they US is making is the 600-700 billion a year going into the military. Without that expense we could <em>easily</em> afford to make America <em>amazing</em>. The Peace Dividend never came to be as we&#39;ve remained on a war footing now for decades.</p>

<p>Who to blame for this? I&#39;d say primarily defense contractors who refuse to let go of constantly agitating for &quot;defense&quot; spending. Further, over the course of a 1/2 century defense contractors have become very smart and have placed important construction plants all across the US in key congressional districts. It&#39;s almost impossible to go against them politically.</p>

<p>Answer? I don&#39;t know. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s really the political class that &quot;hates&quot; us. I think it&#39;s a defense industry that absolutely refuses to let go of its death grip on the political process.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s the same idea, except instead of a cheque to be cashed later it&#39;s &quot;cash&quot; that they get by immediately accepting a debt to the government for the same amount under some strict rules(they need to keep a certain amount of funds liquid to do it, they can&#39;t do this with very high risk investments, the cash that they owe to the government has to be repaid within a short timeline, etc). All that really happens is the bank takes the cash from the government to &quot;create&quot; it, then covers this with the sale of the debts owed to the bank by the person getting the mortgage or small loan. (and not, as a certain financial institution got in a lot of trouble for doing, accepting a new debt to cover the old debt before it expires). The cash is created by the government, but only as long as it&#39;s paid back in very short order(at which point it stops existing again because the debt + asset of cash balances back out).</p>

<p>Most of the trillions that is going though the financial system though isn&#39;t fractional reserve, it&#39;s just not viable for the size of money being passed around from banks to banks for anyone to bother converting it to cash at each stage, instead it just exists as a chain of debt until it can be cashed in and everyone along the chain makes a small profit out of it(either at the time of selling on or off the back of the debt by not selling the whole debt on). Fractional reserve is used for your mortgage or business loan, </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very true, but what form the depopulation/capitalization of the earth takes doesn&#39;t matter to me.  Who gets extracted from the chaos doesn&#39;t matter to me.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t change the motivations, and it doesn&#39;t significantly mitigate the risk to life and civilization that comes with putting all your eggs in one basket.  So I really don&#39;t care.  I could be the first one in line for extraction, and it would make no difference to me.  It could be the most humane depopulation possible (perhaps simply indoctrinating people not to have children) I would still die to stop it, though not kill.</p>

<p>So I really don&#39;t care, but of course you are right, just murdering everyone would be stupid.  Ideally (for them) half the population would work the other half to death as slaves, and then repeat, or something like that, don&#39;t you think?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know enough about the cutting edge of automation to say how many people it would take to fully manipulate the earths resources, but your range sounds good.</p>

<p>Of course there&#39;s no fucking difference, you used the same amount of money for both scenarios; what&#39;s your point?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That paying interest is no difference than mark up. How much more clear can I make that?</p>

<p>People deposit their money and the banks use that money to lend it. The banks still can not use money that isn&#39;t in their possession. Deposited money is in the banks possession. </p>

<p>Federal reserve prints money. So what?</p>

<p>Did you include the Bush tax breaks, generous write-offs on income tax, and other variables that come into the calculation?</p>

<p>Those all factor into the media rates above. The data is from the last few years, nothing major has changed in either tax code recently.</p>

<p>disadvantaging the poor.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If it&#39;s a fair rewrite, this will affect the rich much more, as that is how they avoid those large tax rates of 40%+ at 200k income. They write off a lot of it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, your Donald Trump is going to pass another tax cut?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On the rich, he&#39;s already increased taxes on middle income by raising mortgage insurance rates. He can&#39;t cut taxes by himself, and the deep cuts he&#39;s proposing so far haven&#39;t floated well with Congress.</p>

<p>First off, you are wrong on every single count. NHS doesn&#39;t see for all things you think you pay for. Plus, the Reason the UK left the EU is because of dumb ass shit like medical care coverage that nobody can afford.</p>

<p>As for Obama care, it has almost no major providers, some state&#39;s exchanges are not even in business any longer since the costs to the insurers is multiple times what the exchange pays back.</p>

<p>0bama is a one-world gov&#39;t CIA plant, same as his mother Stanley Dunham, a CIA asset. 0bamacare was never supposed to work, as evidenced by Rep. Pelosi&#39;s comments on it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is a scheme, Central Bank Fractional reserve banking and the fact that FED balance sheet is basically what I call &quot;counterfeited money&quot; or fiat money lent out that is due interest so there is a net negative number of dollars in existence.

<p>&quot;In the modern economy, most money takes the form of bank
deposits. But how those bank deposits are created is often
misunderstood: the principal way is through commercial
banks making loans. Whenever a bank makes a loan, it
simultaneously creates a matching deposit in the
borrower’s bank account, thereby creating new money.&quot;</p>
