    <div class="md"><p>True, you can&#39;t disassociate conspiracy from politics. And I&#39;m not talking about NYT political journalism. We need to discuss what the msm is not reporting. They have an agenda to report the &quot;truths&quot; they deem and it is our job to be skeptical. I won&#39;t sleep peacefully until Bernie had justice for the election fraud we&#39;ve experienced. It&#39;s not about the election or even the candidates, it&#39;s the principle. The Clintons have a 30 year rap sheet and perhaps Trump was put in place from delving in too deep on the Hillary in light of what wikileaks revealed. The ptb have realised with this recent election how powerful the internet is over our TV sets in spreading information and communication with like minded individuals over a large land mass. Again it is not Hillary va Trump and if you think so you don&#39;t belong here. But I do believe the Clintons are very powerful and plotting their revenge behind the scenes, Trump was put in place to be America&#39;s punching bag while she shutters away in the shadows Scott free.</p>

<p>Make a provable hypothesis. If you can violate non-locality through telepathy, or interdimensional travel or whatever, make an experiment and post the video! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Haha down to talk to conspiracy about anything....Maybe replace &#39;anything&#39; with &#39;trump&#39; and you are golden. But yeah keeping with the snarky sarcasm that you like you like to inflect every comment with ill &#39;apologise&#39; too. Sorry the op asked made a suggestion to have a non political day on one of the 7 days of the week. Its not as if he, like others, might be just a bit over reading the same snarky drivel spat out by both sides of the gangwar, always delivered in the same condescending know it all tone, the same empty talking points recycled over and over. No, for you see, you went back a whole year in his reddit history like the normal person you are and found a ted cruz meme he posted to the donald! Clearly this was a whole plan to specifically protect Trump on those pesky Wednesdays when all those bad things come out about him right! And we all know politics only refers to one party so hes clearly just protecting himself. Its not as if conspiracy talks about Clinton or the likes of Seth Rich right mate! Fuck you guys are geniuses, I wish i did 3 courses in a row at college...oh well</p>

Your opposition to unlimited freedom of speech threatens all of us AND the integrity of this sub.

    <div class="md"><p>lets, as a group of ordinary, average people try to reach out to the Russians, who i have been told are very kind, warm, loving people.</p>

<p>Recently, Russians have started playing certain online video games en mass, games that had previously been only popular with Americans and Japanese gamers</p>

<p>lets reach out to the Russians through games and gaming. we are already 99% of the way there. </p>

<p>We know how to play soccer, and chess, and lots of Olympics sports, so lets just develop these gaming relationships on a daily basis </p>

I, for one, would love to see the sub try something like this to bring it a little closer to what it used to be. Before the posts became 80% politics I think it was a bit chiller and more fun to be honest. Politics in itself is a distraction from bigger things so to at least have particular days without politics would be a good breath of fresh air. Better yet imo if there were days specifically for certain themed posts. </p>

<p>followed with a starter post (same posts about aliens, nazis, secret societies, hidden history, media manipulation, political collusion, war atrocities etc circulate here weekly/monthly anyway) just to get things rolling- buy in no way restrict other content that branches off</p>

<p>Idk, I&#39;d hate to use &quot;the Donald&quot; as an example because many here probably can&#39;t stand that place- but the daily sticky threads there work for them. We could do that here but less circle-jerky and more attuned to this subs culture maybe.  </p>

<p>This is the post where an idea is floated that allows, at some point, the reduction of time allotted to political discussion to take place. Selective coverage and theme days doubles as providing increased visibility to conspiracies of lesser credence (aliens, occult, really?). This lowers the reputation of the sub further, reducing traffic and substantive discussion.</p>

<p>That&#39;s your argument against it? Because we won&#39;t be able to discuss Reddit&#39;s &quot;manipulation of political speech&quot;. I would literally prefer seeing nothing but Sasquatch posts in this sub 24/7 than watch you circle jerk about how Reddit is censoring you. Do you honestly have no other reaponse to Reddit&#39;s censorship other than bitching on the exact same website where the censorship is happening? </p>

<p>What&#39;s more, maybe you can explain how the rest of Reddit is having their political discussion controlled but r/conspiracy has somehow remained immune to it. How could it be that here, the place most likely to see resistance to this dark cabal of Reddit censorship, we are somehow managing to keep the word out about the big bad Reddit censors?</p>

<p>Why would r/conspiracy be immune to that manipulation given that it exists in the same space as every other sub, namely Reddit? And if it&#39;s not immune, then why spend time in this sub trying to fight censorship when the effort is inherently already doomed to fail?</p>

<p>Surely there must be a better way to fight censorship than post on a site where your political message is guaranteed to be censored.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Screw that. The &#39;no politics! Politics are dumb!&#39; noise is one of the most frequently observed circlejerks in a controlled sub or one in battle for control.</p>

<p>Let me be the first to stand up on my soapbox and point out that politics fucking matter. The strength of Reddit is how we can share our differing specialties, access to historic memory, crowdsourced research, and then ELI5 why it matters. Then go better and ELI5 next-steps to do something about it.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s just leave the walls undefended one day a week. Having sentries to keep guard while in hostile territory every night is tedious. Let&#39;s just take one night a week while we all go to sleep. Nothing bad will happen that one night right? Not like those trying to slip a spear into our ribs would pay attention and notice when a particularly wide changing of the guard takes place.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For a while this sub as a whole was starting to realize politics are not important.... They only have as much power as we let them. The more we ignore them as a society and take it upon ourselves to manage our lives and solve our own problems, the less they matter... If we can change society starting locally to live with that in mind eventually they lose their power in a way that cannot just be taken back quickly. Its about thinking outside of the system. Politics are a lie and the important stuff happens outside of our control anyways, because the elite airway know to work outside the system... they can potentially be useful, but once the elections pass and you come to terms with the fact that everyone sucks and lied to get elected again, you just go back to living locally outside their mandates....slowly but surely, one day they will become so unimportant that the thought of complying with some rule the dicks in suits 7 states away made will be laughable.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not weird. My post was to show that the people who claim anti-Trump submissions always get downvoted is bullshit. It was to show that this supposedly &quot;pro-Trump&quot; subreddit suspiciously upvotes anti-Trump posts. Don&#39;t you see the people here every day who make these claims?</p>

<p>That doesn&#39;t explain all of the other anti-Trump posts that hit the front page of this sub and didn&#39;t make it to <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a>, including the ones I found that hit the top spot. Check the comments out on pro and anti-Trump submissions. It&#39;s more likely you will see anti-Trump comments, but it probably depends on the day and which side is brigading at the time. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>lol the world has been conquered and is being run by psychopaths and dark occultists.  Look around you.  The population has been dumbed down and mind-controlled.  Then there are so many insiders, whistleblowers and former military officers who attest to the existence of extra-terrestrials and reverse-engineering of craft for military Special Access Programs.  You literally have to have your head in the sand to dismiss the overwhelming evidence.  Of course they are covering it up and keeping it hidden.  The highest levels of the corporate hegemony have their <em>own</em> secret programs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, it is a scam. It&#39;s a fake defense. Like they accidentally break the law without intent. Hillary and Bill both were lawyers. Both lost the right to practice law. They KNOW the law. So does Comey. The only time the intent is valid is if someone accidentally breaks the law. Like you accidentally forget to put an item on the cashier&#39;s table to pay for it. No intent. It&#39;s not theft. But if you cover the problem up and lie about it, that&#39;s intent. You lose that defense. But remember this, which everyone gets wrong. Comey, during his speech to the press he claimed that Hillary did not intend to harm the USA concerning the emails and handling classified data. Which is an even weaker defense. She did intend to break the law. He couldn&#39;t even try to make that defense of Hillary. So he didn&#39;t. </p>

<p>However, if something uber-important comes up, the mods should suspend the rule for the day and post a sticky.

<p>Make a provable hypothesis. If you can violate non-locality through telepathy, or interdimensional travel or whatever, make an experiment and post the video! </p>

<p>That&#39;s how science works. We have happily adopted Tesla&#39;s electrical inventions, but he didn&#39;t make a testable hypothesis for his spiritual beliefs. Prove that you&#39;re right. Convince us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Idk if we should restrict anything more than necessary, I kinda just thought like a daily green thread post like &quot;alien Monday (hopefully something less lame) </p>

<p>followed with a starter post (same posts about aliens, nazis, secret societies, hidden history, media manipulation, political collusion, war atrocities etc circulate here weekly/monthly anyway) just to get things rolling- buy in no way restrict other content that branches off</p>

<p>Idk, I&#39;d hate to use &quot;the Donald&quot; as an example because many here probably can&#39;t stand that place- but the daily sticky threads there work for them. We could do that here but less circle-jerky and more attuned to this subs culture maybe.  </p>
