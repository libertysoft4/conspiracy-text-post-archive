        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Soros owns several companies that make a shit pile of voting machines in the U.S. and more signifigantly lately Europe especially france. Voting machines are as complex as casino machines and the lottery machines at every gas station you have ever been to. They dont need to save money they sell on unhackability.  You can&#39;t hack an atm a voting machine or a casino machine without having the O.S. already and then plugging right into the bastard.</p>

<p>Period ever. Never ever. Not even the really crappy ones. Not even the prototypes.</p>

<p>Nobody buys any of these three items and then hooks them up to a wireless anything they do not come with the capability to begin with and never will because it is a FAULTY concept for them to have connectivity. COnnectivity is exactly what the manufacturers seek to avoid with these items not only for security but also to ensure that once you buy the bastard you always have to contact them for any repair , just a like a car so fucked to work on you need to take it to the dealer for an oil change because you have to take off the front right tire to get at the oil filter or spend 3 hours removing the bumper on your cadillac to change the HID headlight.</p>

<p>caveat-lottery machines are connected to a network that only serves the lottery office in the state they are placed in on dedicated lines to the headquarters and then the headquarters have dedicated lines to eachother and the central office they are all carried by time warner cable/L3 on dedicated fiber optic runs (office and headquarters lines) . data ONLY GOES OUT the lottery machines (at gas stations) to the headquarters it cannot come in the machines do not accept information. cannot hack. ever. There was rumor of an inside job occuring in the state of minnesota a few years back involving small payouts of around 100,000 to a million dollars being arranged by lottery employees a few years back, but the man in question slit his own wrists while drunk and walked out into the woods like 4 miles from his houses in the frigid minnesota winter and froze to death cept the amount of blood lost defied how far he was able to walk in his state and the temperature. There can be cheating at the lottery but it would have to be done with someone with access to a main office. You couldnt do anything from your typical powerball machine at holiday or flying j&#39;s or circle k.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>hence noone hacked them did they that would be know as election fraud wouldnt it, who has a controlling interest in diebold? George Soros. So yeah that is my point you cant hack them and unless russians were there they couldnt affect the election and they dont have memory cards they arent cameras. they have internal storage like your hard drive</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i agree i am simply trying to rid people of the lie that the vote was &quot;hacked&quot; and pointing out if we want to open that box of conspiracies that we need to look at all the angles and not just the ones that fit our political biases, soros owns alot of voting machines all over the world. He has a huge network of political activists and lobbyists. He has much influence everywhere. Is he the head of the snake probably not. Is he a major player who shouldnt be overlooked absolutely.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah ok so if I&#39;m understanding correctly, you&#39;re saying the Russian hacking angle is bullshit and it&#39;s more about following the money and power trail, hence it leads back to the evil like Soros.

    <div class="md"><p>yes an illegal attempt if it were true. I think there was also one other state involved. This all happened if I remeber correctly after Trump made the joke about Russia finding Hillary&#39;s emails for us and giving them to the FBI. I think the entire story was false and placed to build a covert foundation in peoples minds to lead them towards the concept of a hack being possible and happening.

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry. No I will not censor my views for your benefit and the furtherance of your viewpoint. We can discuss it in a civil manner and maybe come to an agreement or we can cease to communicate like adults. I dont do ultimatums. </p>

<p>You can tamper with a voting machine. You cannot hack it. Words are very important here. Especially as relates to this issue. There is a huge conspiracy at work here. Has been for years. There is an elite ruling class in america that has enjoyed a comfortable status quo for years misleading and fooling Americans. They are terrified and losing power right now since the election of Donald Trump. We are witnessing the Death Rattle of the establishment/TPTB right now.</p>

<p>We need to tread carefully mentally to avoid becoming sucked back into the vortex they keep us in to keep us under their thumbs.</p>

<p>Someone who is in an organization he donates to owns it. That is some hair splitting I am a lawyer defending the mob kind of logic. Really? Come on. He soley funds hundreds of agenda driven organizations and shell companies to push his agenda for the world. Just like bloomberg and his numerous anti gun groups. If I pay a junkie to break into your house and take your stuff at the end of the day I am still guilty of conspiracy. It would just make me slightly smarter than the average criminal by adding a few degrees of seperation between myself and the deeds I am paying someone else to do. Even you must realize at the core that arguement does not hold water. You may never be able to admit it but the logical part of your brain tells you it must be true.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How quickly intelligent conversation devolves into boo hoo I dont wanna play and I am taking my toys and going home. I know that soros owns the controlling shares in not only the company that was called die bold but also several other companies that make voting machines. I don&#39;t care what information you have gleamed from bloomberg owned buisiness insider or snopes or what ever other online rag you take at face value.</p>

<p>I simply called you out on your statement in a respectful manner. I am sorry you are unable to do so yourself (have a respectful converstation that is) . You were probably one of those kids who throws the controller at the screen and cries when mario got bit by a gumba too. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Libertarians are the ultimate reactionaries and the oldest harshest form of conservatism the feudalism of pre-Magna Carta Europe.  </p>

<p>Their idea of liberalism  is to remove any protections and laws by a government that protect anything but their own rights to profit from any act including enslavement of other humans. </p>

<p>What you are offering is 18th century vision of liberal for justification for laissez faire capitalism, but it is not the modern U.S. understanding of that word means,  though at the core of the definition, </p>

<p>&quot;move away from central control,&quot; the word can be used for widely different outcomes.  </p>

<p>Libertarian liberalism is removing government controls on production, trade, labor, and of limiting taxes only for military and police costs, said taxes to be paid by the lower classes only. </p>

<p>U.S. liberalism is clearly centered in removing laws that limit individuals right to live protected by those first ten amendments called the Bill of Rights or the list of guaranteed individual rights. </p>

<p>Libertarians claim no government can list or guarantee any individual rights. </p>

<p>The most famous example that there are two different sides is of course the Revolution of 1776, the American Colonies against the King of England. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>you are no longer making sense. This isn&#39;t a thing you can debate your way out of. Green apples and red apples are the same. Even Hitler said as much when he started the red apple movement. He said the only difference between red apples and green apples was the focus on racial purity.</p>

<p>Libertarians hold actual liberal viewpoints. SO called liberals are facists and Progressives are socialists , on a progressive journey towards communism. You used a bunch of Karl the tard Marx words in your response that is when I stopped listening.</p>

<p>No he doesn&#39;t, please source. </p>

<p>Voting machines are as complex as casino machines and the lottery machines at every gas station you have ever been to. They dont need to save money they sell on unhackability.  You can&#39;t hack an atm a voting machine or a casino machine without having the O.S. already and then plugging right into the bastard. Period ever. Never ever. Not even the really crappy ones. Not even the prototypes.</p>

<p>Unhackability lol</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Nobody buys any of these three items and then hooks them up to a wireless anything they do not come with the capability to begin with and never will because it is a FAULTY concept for them to have connectivity. COnnectivity is exactly what the manufacturers seek to avoid with these items not only for security but also to ensure that once you buy the bastard you always have to contact them for any repair , just a like a car so fucked to work on you need to take it to the dealer for an oil change because you have to take off the front right tire to get at the oil filter or spend 3 hours removing the bumper on your cadillac to change the HID headlight.</p>

<p>Google the first part of that equation to find you&#39;re wrong. </p>

<p>Also, I believe this is an attempt to frame the recently leaked document by Reality Winner as unimportant. Hacking voting machines was not the only reason for those attacks, I can expand on that if anyone likes. </p>

I know that soros owns the controlling shares in not only the company that was called die bold but also several other companies that make voting machines.

<p>I simply called you out on your statement in a respectful manner. I am sorry you are unable to do so yourself (have a respectful converstation that is) . You were probably one of those kids who throws the controller at the screen and cries when mario got bit by a gumba too. </p>
