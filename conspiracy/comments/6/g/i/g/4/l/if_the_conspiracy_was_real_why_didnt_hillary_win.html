<p>Why would he announce he was committing the greatest fraud/heist in history? I have an explanation:</p>

<p>Hillary was more popular than Trump overall. But he won due to an electoral college victory. There was no attempt to steal the election illegally (cost-benefit sucks for that). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A fair response. I think this is an important topic to consider when we talk about &quot;the powers that be&quot;. </p>

<p>How absolute are their powers really? Some theories require they practically omniscient to work, but if they still make mistakes and if they can easily be overcome by their own cockiness and the American voting system perhaps they aren&#39;t that powerful at all.</p>

<p>Nobody ever has absolute power. They move up and down the spectrum, but &quot;absolute&quot; is merely theoretical.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Indeed, a great topic good enough for its own thread.  Seems no one knows.  I personally feel there are atleast a few TPTB groups vying for domination.  Once the power is consolidated, with tech as it is, I think near omniscience is possible.</p>

<p>If the dominant force is some insanely powerful alien or AI, well, game over - and I can assume the flaws we see in their absolute power is completely feigned to lead us forward to inevitability.</p>

<p>What is your perspective?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I also believe there are multiple groups vying for power. I think religion was the original consolidation of power, and I think the constant struggle over the Dome of the Rock in the Middle East is evidence that there is not currently a united force behind all of the manipulations we see.</p>

<p>I believe a totally powerful force is possible, but not necessarily inevitable. Even if one was to arise I think there will always be some chance to overthrow it, simply because you can never rule out random chance. </p>

He wasn&#39;t getting negative coverage because most media outlets thought he wasn&#39;t a &quot;serious&quot; candidate and not worth the time.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve seen too much &quot;failure&quot; of media to cover sensational stories to accept that. It is best called censorship. </p>

<p>If they wanted to get rid of Donald Trump, they could have. That would have cut his support dramatically.</p>

<p>Also, Republicans could have got together and forced some of the 18 clowns to drop out.</p>

<p>When you think about the Republican primaries, Donald Trump the outsider was set up to win <em>absolutely</em> by running so many of the usual suspects against him. </p>

<p>If that&#39;s not a smoking gun, recall what the stock market did after the election. Those were the highest level oligarchs unable to contain their glee.</p>

<p>On the coasts but here in middle America, they love the guy. They see him as a modern day Reagan.

    <div class="md"><p>He interfered with availability by restricting briefings to only certain news outlets for purely political reasons. Monkeying with libel law so he could sue the press more easily is a clear effort to interfere with press. It would be summarily struck down by the first court that heard it <em>because it interferes.</em> </p>

<p>His continuous whining and complaining calling factual coverage &quot;fake news&quot; if it reflects poorly upon him, but not when it doesn&#39;t.  While not explicitly unconstitutional, its certainly an effort to interfere with the press and the kind of behavior third world dictators do. </p>

<p>But five sources told Politico on Monday that US Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis, national security adviser H.R.

<p>Do you have a link of the testimony? I haven&#39;t read this but I would like to.</p>

<p>This is the one that gets me. Don&#39;t you think that sounded more like &quot;<em>I&#39;m on to you</em>&quot;? Think about it. I mean, if Trump and Epstein had a stolen rare jewel racket going on, do you think Trump would say, &quot;He&#39;s a great guy. I hear he likes rare gems. The rarer the better.&quot;?? That sounds a lot more like being called out to me, like a veiled threat.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Then there is Epstein pleading the 5th when asked about Trump raping children. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You plead the 5th to avoid incriminating yourself. </p>

<p>President Donald Trump&#39;s own national security team was reportedly blindsided after he did he did not explicitly endorse Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization&#39;s founding document during his summit with NATO allies in Brussels last month.</p>

<p>But five sources told Politico on Monday that US Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis, national security adviser H.R. McMaster, and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson worked with Trump on the speech for weeks and pushed hard for the Article 5 language to be included after viewing later drafts in which it had been taken out.</p>
