<p>I do know the Earth is round because there are many proofs/experiments that allow us to establish it as such. </p>

<p>As any adult is likely aware, things are not always as they appear. To blindly assume that anything you perceive with your senses to be accurate is the height of folly. Optical illusions teach us this at a young age. Our senses have adapted to give us a working understanding of the world around us, not necessarily the most accurate one.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Careful with flat earth.  Usual discussion on it contains a logical failure that is fairly easy to miss unless someone points it out to you.  Disproving one model(the mainstream globe) is not the same thing as proving another specific model correct.  They should be treated as two separate topics.</p>

<p>An example of a problem with the flat earth model as it is usually presented: day lengths in the Southern hemisphere in the flat earth model don&#39;t work with the sun following a path that circles around the North pole.  The longest summer days at the tip of South America would require a viewable distance such that the Northern hemisphere would be in constant sunlight.</p>

<p>This does not excuse the many problems with the official model that are pointed out in flat earth theory, as I said, they should really be seen as two different topics.  Also, you are unlikely to get a good reaction in this subreddit, most people here are suffering from flat earth fatigue.  I think the topic is pushed as a limited hangout as a way to blackwash the problems with the official model and excuse the space fraud.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been getting into flat earth recently myself (question everything), and the only answer I can provide for you is in the form of questions. Have you gone to both the equator and the South pole and weighed yourself? Have you done it within the span of a few days? Or are you just going by what you&#39;ve been told?</p>

<p>The real purpose of the flat earth theory is to get people to question reality/authority. Whether it&#39;s true or not is irrelevant. However, with my recent delve into Gnosticism (archons/demiurge), living in the Matrix (3D simulation), Alternate history/precursor civilizations (Westworld-esque), flat Earth really begins to make sense. I mean, if we&#39;re living in a constructed reality where higher dimensional beings harvest our emotions, why would they  go through all of the trouble to make such a sophisticated reality and instead just fake it? Which comes to my question that I have for other flat earthers: why? Why is the earth flat? And I refuse to take stupid answers like, because the bible says so.</p>

<p>I&#39;m falling down this rabbit hole deep and fast, and I&#39;m definitely interested in discussing it more with people open to the possibility that our reality isn&#39;t what it seems.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been watching stuff from Eric Dubay and the whole theory doesn&#39;t seem to be so stupid as I thought it was at the beginning. But I definitely wouldn&#39;t take my body weight. I would take an object with a stable mass and you only have to go to the equator and not really to the north pole because anywhere else in the world whether north or south the equator like USA or Germany you should see a difference in weight</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I looked into flat Earth theory pretty seriously for a few weeks myself. But I was dissuaded by a very compelling argument made by another user here on Reddit.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the best argument I&#39;ve ever heard <em>against</em> flat Earth theory: if I live in California, and my mum lives in the UK, I can call her at noon (my time, when the sun is highest in the sky) and she&#39;ll tell me the sun is setting where she is.  We&#39;re pretty obviously both looking at the same sun, so how is this possible if the earth is flat?  </p>

<p>I can&#39;t refute that - I can&#39;t come up with a flat-Earth or domed-Earth theory that explains how time zones work the way they do.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You didn&#39;t look into flat earth theory at all, let alone seriously. Time zones are the easiest one: the Sun is very high above the earth, thousands of miles, and moves. So when it is straight overhead it is noon. Everywhere else, it is not, and across the earth, it is night. </p>

<p>Funny that you say it could be literally anything else but flat. Wait until torus earth is popularly ridiculed and you&#39;ll say it will be anything else but torus. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Even your own quotes tell us we can agree on a physical reality, but it doesn&#39;t make it fact.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is not what my quote says. I pointed out problems with relying on your senses, that is why using methods independent of yourself, such as repeatable experiments, is the best way to understand our world.</p>

<p>To a certain degree we cannot &quot;know&quot; anything. It is possible you are in a comma and this is a dream. It is possible there is an invisible Flying Spaghetti Monster that lords over us all. However, that does not mean you cannot have any degree of certainty in life.</p>

<p>It is interesting to acknowledge the limits of our perceptions, but using logic and reason we find that there are very practical methods of determining our physical world to a high degree of certainty.</p>

<p>In other words, to the extent we can know anything, we know the earth is round. While &quot;proving&quot; anything to be absolute can be impossible depending on what you require as proof, that does not mean all possibilities are equally likely. The flat Earth model does not explain what we observe in our physical world, the globe Earth model does.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok.  Now I&#39;ve read the article.</p>

<p>Not one of those &quot;scientific&quot; items is proof.  Not one.</p>

<p>The article tells you a reason like &quot;you can see farther from higher up,&quot; explains why that is in support, and states- &quot;the only way that could be true is if the earth is round.&quot;</p>

<p>Is it?  It&#39;s the ONLY way that could be true?</p>

<p>This is science.  It is ever-evolving.  Assumptions that are considered foregone conclusions have many, many times been shown to be wrong.</p>

<p>So, my original statement is unchanged.  You cannot know, because you simply cannot know.  No matter what we can observe, we cannot observe the roundness of the earth.  Going into space and observing it for ourselves could not even be real proof, because optical illusions happen all the time (remember the poor bushman who thought that buffalo were ants from a distance)?</p>

<p>Knowing and evidence are two separate things.  Evidence is great.  Evidence builds a case.  But evidence doesn&#39;t prove a conclusion.</p>

<p>Literally never.  That&#39;s why any study, no matter how often repeated, could be falsified.  Even Wikipedia states of scientific laws</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know for sure either. I don&#39;t think anyone knows for sure about all of it but there is just so much wrong with the science that the masses are taught.  I suspect that half of what I was taught in school is questionable (including evolution). No matter what shape earth is, I&#39;m glad it seems many people are waking up to so much of the bullshit we&#39;ve all been fed, and at least are questioning official and main stream narratives and stances.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I agree with you! Imo people questioning the shape of the earth is a great thing bcs it shows what we think of the system and to see where they lie to us about certain things. But I think they don&#39;t lie to us about everything. A turning point for me was when I discovered that Eric Dubay is holocaust denier which is for me too far.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think they lie about each and everything either, though even truth can be exaggerrated, omitted or bent. As far as <em>who</em> is speaking the truth, I try to limit my ad hominem bias, if what someone says makes sense to me.</p>

<p>To me, it would be kind of ad hominem to look at Dubay&#39;s belief&#39;s about the holocaust, which I don&#39;t agree with either, and look at that as a valid reason to disagree with what he says about flat earth. The good part about flat earth or any anti-establishment movement, is that there are thousands sharing ideas and we don&#39;t need heroes or pastors preaching at us. But yes, there is a limit to disagreeing with everything government and TPTB say, if that&#39;s what you mean, but to each his own.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>about the weight at the equator... google says you would weigh 5.5 oz less per 100 lbs that is a negligible amount. Our body weight shifts a few pounds up and down every couple days. also have you gone to the equator and then to the north pole with weights and done experiments? I doubt you have or know anyone who has. So therefore I wouldn&#39;t believe it.  Certainly it wouldn&#39;t disprove the fact that no experiment exists that can make water stick to a globe. we don&#39;t see the curve no matter how high we go and the horizon stays at eye level. These are major facts which cannot be discounted.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It doesn&#39;t matter if the 45 lb. barbell only weighs 39 lbs. You weigh it and record the weight as 39.0 lbs. at the equator. Write your name on it with a felt pen.
