    <div class="md"><p>Actually, you are very clearly picking a side with this comment. You are attempting to decide for your users that the current administration is secretly on the same team as the previous administration. It&#39;s fine if you believe that, as long as you recognize that it is your own personal bias. We still don&#39;t know for sure what is going on with Donald Trump. If he is actually working against the criminal government, then it would make sense for shilling organizations to push your viewpoint on the internet to keep a lid on his public support.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is not anti-government by default, it is anti-corruption and anti-authoritarian. Many of us here would love to support our country if it wasn&#39;t compromised by Deep State criminals. That&#39;s why there is so much grass roots support for Donald Trump on forums that have been traditionally anti-establishment. Many of us see Donald Trump as a possible chance to break the criminal influence in government. It&#39;s fine if you disagree, but that is your own personal bias, not a fact. This is a perfectly reasonable forum for discussion of that possibility.</p>

If Donald Trump and Jeff Sessions fail at their attempt to take out the global international Mafia, then you may find yourself with a new anarchist brother.

    <div class="md"><p>One last chance? </p>

<p>You&#39;ve got more patience than me. Our system of government date two millenia. The complaints made today echo those made by Jesus. How many last chances have we given them?</p>

<p>Individual rights cannot be protected by a government just as criminal influence in government cannot be fought with government.</p>

<p>I&#39;m glad you&#39;ll see things this way soon, because even on the odd chance that Trump has the goal of draining the swamp, it&#39;s a sysiphean task. Every step of the way, tens of thousands of petty corrupt bureaucrats will oppose him.</p>

<p>Our best chance is local solidarity and media presence ridiculing and outing our local corruption and waking the masses up to the fact that distant kings only have as much power over us as we allow them to.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What the hell is your point? If there is a chance of restoring justice and restoring the nation to something we can be proud of, then hell yes I&#39;m a cheerleader for that.  </p>

<p>Your <em>opinion</em> is that this is no place for people who are optimistic about Donald Trump. I say who the hell are you and why should I care what you think?  </p>

<p>Here&#39;s an analogy: suppose Ron Paul had won in 2008 or 2012. Would you be here saying the same thing to all the Ron Paul supporters cheering him on in this forum?  </p>

<p>The difference is a matter of personal bias. You don&#39;t believe Donald Trump is at all similar to Ron Paul. I don&#39;t necessarily believe that either. But I do see how it&#39;s a possibility that cannot be ruled out at this point.  </p>

<p>The more desperately people push back against that idea here, the more likely it seems to me that the criminal elite want him gone because he represents a deadly threat against the Deep State.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is no $110 billion deal. You have been mislead. The only deals that <em>may eventually go to the Senate for approval</em> were deals initiated under the Obama administration. Really, go look into it for yourself and see how easily you find corrections and backtracking on the original story that was shoved down our throats by ShareBlue and mainstream propaganda networks.  </p>

<p>This is exactly what I am talking about. There is a desperate effort underway to plaster social media with propaganda intended to persuade people like me to believe that Trump is somehow going back on his campaign promises and working for the globalist agenda. It&#39;s possible, but so far I see no reason to believe it. If I change my feelings on that, it&#39;s certainly not going to be based on a knee jerk reaction to a low-effort comment on Reddit.</p>

I don&#39;t know, it&#39;s possible trumps on our side, but we all should&#39;ve learned to remain skeptical until proven otherwise; let alone thinking voting another suit into office will &quot;save us and fix things&quot; like it has with every other president in the past. /s</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure, remain skeptical. But there are two sides to that coin. The true skeptical position would allow for the possibility that Trump is legitimately on the side of the people. On the other hand, I see a continuous effort to hijack the skeptical position in this subreddit:  </p>

<p>&quot;True skeptics know that Trump is just another globalist puppet like every other president.&quot;  </p>

<p>Actually, no, we don&#39;t know that. We don&#39;t know that he is on our side, either, but we don&#39;t know that he&#39;s not.  </p>

<p>After everything we have seen in the past year, I am legitimately ready to believe that Donald Trump is <em>not</em> just another suit. I don&#39;t know much of anything with certainty. But my gut instinct draws me more and more towards the possibility that he is the real deal. If he manages to reveal the criminal cartel behind the curtain, 
then I will be there to stand with him against any attacks whatsoever.  </p>

<p>So if this is really happening, wouldn&#39;t you (hypothetically) expect to see tremendous pressure to control forums like this one and prevent the masses from truly catching on to his strategy?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Was there anything invalid about what I said? His point has been pretty clearly true for decades, but there&#39;s no denying that something funny happened during the last election. It&#39;s possible that somebody got into power who wasn&#39;t supposed to, and if we pay attention this may finally be an opportunity to shake up the left/right paradigm and blow the whole criminal system wide open.  </p>

<p>Now that something different <em>finally</em> happened in a US election, we have moderators pushing their opinion that this is business like usual and we are attacking the subreddit if we think otherwise.  </p>

<p>This is literally the strategy laid out in the ShareBlue memos leaked at the beginning of the year: neuter alternative media by compromising discussion forums and pushing the narrative that Trump is a double agent for the NWO.  </p>

<p>People seem to be very sensitive that I am even making that suggestion. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This actually happened a few years ago. There were accounts that had like one letter difference and were used to discredit certain users. I guess they are going after the mods now. </p>

<p>The flat earth thing and similar crap that we see in this sub is most definitely due, in large part, to trolling. I&#39;m not saying there are zero actual flat earthers in here because there probably are a few, but these &quot;trolls&quot; are quite dedicated to discrediting the entire sub or specific users, I guess depending on their mood each day. </p>

<p>Some people out there really hate conspiracy theorists for some reason and they especially hate this sub, so they do anything they can to stir up nonsense in here and make us look even worse than we already do. They exaggerate how many racists and nazis are in here as well so that they can run around in other subs and claim &quot;<a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is very anti-semitic&quot;, and we actually have proof of that.</p>

<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/62nxah/proven_false_flags_against_rconspiracy_to_make/">Proven false flags against /r/conspiracy to make everyone here seem racist.</a></p>

<p>The flat earth nonsense is probably similar as well as many of the other really stupid things you see in this sub. Don&#39;t let them convince you that all conspiracy theories are stupid just because they are good at convincingly exaggerating how stupid some of the people are. Remember, any random person can post anything they want in here, so just because some of the content is dumb does not mean that the dumb content is representative or associated with the better stuff.  </p>
