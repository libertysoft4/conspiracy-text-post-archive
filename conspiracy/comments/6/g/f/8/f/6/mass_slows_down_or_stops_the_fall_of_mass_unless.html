    <div class="md"><p>Ugh, you&#39;re one of those types... Ok stay with me..
As a building implodes, air pressure builds and eventually needs to vent, therefore blowing debris outward and on to surrounding buildings and streets...
90% of the buildings structure fell into its own footprint.</p>

<p>Watch any controlled building demolition video, Now compare those to the twin towers collapse.. See any similarities?
Now watch a video of a building falling over due to structural failures (ie broken beam or concrete column)... They twist and bend and often fall to one side.
Totally unlike the WTC.</p>

<p>You are correct about the air being forced out. This is the thing people always think are squibs in the videos of the World Trade towers. </p>

<p>Now its 90%? Are you gong to keep moving things to where you can be technically correct to save face? I will provide you with your own words.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe terrorists hijacked aircraft and flew them into the WTC, the Pentagon and one crashed into a field in PA.</p>

<p>I believe the WTC were already weakened from the bombing in the 90s.</p>

<p>I believe the damage and fires from the airplanes caused a chain of events that brought down the towers. </p>

<p>I believe the fires were bad enough inside the tower that some people decided to jump to their deaths instead of burning alive. </p>

<p>These are just my beliefs. A body in motion tends to stay in motion......when the floor collapsed and the top of the tower fell, the next floor was not strong enough to absorb the impact and it just kept falling. </p>

<p>The mass and velocity of the collapsing tower created enough power that the surrounding buildings were just simply destroyed.</p>

<p>These are just my beliefs. </p>

<p>Let me ask you something, why even attempt to believe the official story? Is it denial? Is it because if you believe the official then you will regret having wished genocide on an entire race? Did you join the military based on 9/11 and are reluctant to question your motives for doing so?

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;at free fall speed&quot;; when something falls, what speed would you prefer it fall at other than free fall speed?</p>

<p>&quot;NIST determined that diesel fuel did not play an important role, nor did the structural damage from the collapse of the Twin Towers or the transfer elements (trusses, girders, and cantilever overhangs). The lack of water to fight the fire was an important factor. The fires burned out of control during the afternoon, causing floor beams near column 79 to expand and push a key girder off its seat, triggering the floors to fail around column 79 on Floors 8 to 14. With a loss of lateral support across nine floors, column 79 buckled – pulling the east penthouse and nearby columns down with it. With the buckling of these critical columns, the collapse then progressed east-to-west across the core, ultimately overloading the perimeter support, which buckled between Floors 7 and 17, causing the remaining portion of the building above to fall downward as a single unit. The fires, which were fueled by office contents and burned for 7 hours, along with the lack of water, were the key reasons for the collapse.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No&quot; is the answer to your long list of questions at the bottom. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The entire area was unstable, made so by the tower falling. The fires and intense heat from the damaged buildings brought it down. Building 7 burned for hours before it came down. Debris, unstable ground, fires, structural damage, all from the other towers led to it falling.</p>

<p>I saw your post, thought I would learn some new or interesting perspective that might change my mind, and nope. </p>

<p>My reply was to someone asking if anyone believed it wasn&#39;t the government, I believe it was Al Qaeda. </p>

<p>After watching the latest rounds of IC testimonies, the real red pill is accepting that our government is too incompetent to pull off something as big as 9/11. </p>

<p>Right, it wasn&#39;t the US government it was the Israelis! Really? Then why are they still battling Hamas or Libya or the UN? These people just ain&#39;t that smart. Let me guess the OKC bombing was the US government too?</p>

<p>I just don&#39;t buy it and nothing I&#39;ve seen so far has changed my perspective. Now if you want to say the US knew this was going to happen and did nothing to prevent the terrorists from hijacking the planes then I could see that. </p>

<p>Now, since the CIA had offices there, a case could be made that they used burn-barrels and it got out of control. </p>

<p>The burn-barrels I used had some kind of a dry phosphorus mix that burned pretty hot. They had to be used outside, now.....indoors?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nope. All the reports, the video from a reporter at the site and eye witnesses all show that it was heavily damaged. No reports of explosives going off and it had been on fire for several hours.</p>

<p>Trust me, I love a good conspiracy. I had hoped there was proof of guys firing a missile from the top of a Walmarts. I would love to believe that people in the towers were prepped and that&#39;s why they didn&#39;t show up to work. I would even love to believe that there were satanic riches being stolen from the magical vaults hidden in the ante chambers of the WTC&#39;s deepest dungeons.</p>

<p>I just haven&#39;t seen anything that makes me believe it. It is a good read and I&#39;m keeping an open mind, but I&#39;m just too far away from believing it right now. Nothing in this post has changed my mind.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My father was a firefighter present when the second tower collapsed and when WTC 7 collapsed, and was later trapped in rubble for nearly 24 hours with my next door neighbor who was also a firefighter at the time. There are numerous things he saw and experienced while there that day and in the following months of clean up that firmly made my family believe the official 9/11 story is a big crock of horseshit. Here&#39;s a few of his odd experiences.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>While accompanying a dazed and confused fire chief who was desperately calling on the radio for his long-dead chauffeur, a man in construction attire (reflective vest, hard hat, boots) calmly walked up to the both of them and upon overhearing their concern about WTC 7 , he assured them not to worry as the building would be &quot;coming down around 5&quot; (this was a few hours before). Sure enough it came down at 5:21. Additionally, the &quot;construction man&quot; was uncharacteristically clean, which made no sense as <em>everyone</em> else was coated in dust. </p></li>
<li><p>He and numerous other first responders were repeatedly denied access to WTC 7 by heavily armed men with badges, who said they could not enter because of &quot;national security&quot; and an ongoing &quot;federal terrorism investigation&quot;.</p></li>
<li><p>During the clean up, there were numerous areas in ground zero where first responders (including my father) were repeatedly denied access to, again, with vauge &quot;national security&quot; or &quot;ongoing federal terrorism investigations&quot; being the reason given. NYPD detectives and forensics units, easily among the best in the world, were denied access to a terror attack in their own backyard (because terrorism makes it into a federal matter I believe, I still disagree with the descion to ban them from certain areas).</p></li>
<li><p>He remembers pulling out pieces of the plane, and even has some pieces to this day which we will get tested to see if it is indeed from the 757 that allegedly hit the towers. The pieces seem to not be from a Boeing aircraft at all, but we are not aviation experts so this is merely initial speculation.</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>I see what you&#39;re saying, and not to be contradictory, but your logic <em>would</em> work if the towers were monolithic. But they&#39;re not. They&#39;re hollow. Buildings are essentially airspace grids. And 9/11 was basically launching a missile (meaning shape, not object) into an object that is dominantly airspace. I&#39;m not saying you&#39;re wrong, I&#39;m saying that should be taken into account.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Adopting the Devil&#39;s Advocate role here...</p>

<p>This is true. However, there is another factor that you&#39;ve overlooked.</p>

<p>Consider a snowball at the top of a smooth glass slope. We let the ball go and it rolls down the slope, accelerating until it reaches the highest speed it can travel down the slope - we&#39;ll call this speed &quot;free fall&quot;.</p>

<p>Next we take the same size snowball to the top of the slope, but this time we build a series of small identical walls made of snow across the slope so that the snowball has to hit them as it rolls down.</p>

<p>When we release the snowball it accelerates until it hits the first wall, but it is slowed down by the &quot;equal and opposite&quot; force of the impact. In this case the amount of energy being transferred into the wall is a large portion of the total energy the falling snowball contains. There is enough energy in the impact, however, to cause the wall to fail, and the passing snowball picks up that snow and adds it to its &#39;falling mass&#39;.</p>

<p>The snowball then accelerates again until it hits the second wall. But this time it is more massive than when it hit the first wall, so it is not slowed as much because the amount of energy transferred into the wall is the same, but is a lower proportion of the total energy the snowball contains. Why is the transferred energy the same? Because it takes the same amount of energy to cause the wall to fail each time, and once the wall has failed no more energy can be transferred into it.</p>

<p>So the second time, the wall fails quicker than the first time, and it slows the snowball less. This means the growing snowball is accelerating from a higher velocity after each impact than the one before. It keeps doing this over and over again, slowing less and less with each impact, and gaining more and more mass.</p>

<p>Eventually, there is so much mass in the falling snowball, that the walls fail long before the amount of energy the snowball contains is transferred into it, and thus the relatively small &quot;equal and opposite&quot; reaction can not overcome that energy to slow the snowball. At this point the snowball will continue to accelerate until it hits &quot;free fall&quot; speed, and each subsequent wall simply disintegrates as if it was never there.</p>

<p>In the terms of the WTC towers, the amount of energy it would take to cause each floor to fail is essentially the same, but the amount of energy the falling floors contain is constantly growing, just like our rolling snowball. The falling mass grows, losing less of its energy with each impact and accelerating until it hits free fall speed.</p>
