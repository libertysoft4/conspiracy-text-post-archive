        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I have dealt with bitcoin before and if you look at the increase in the last year in value it has grew phenomenaly. 1btc at the moment is worth just over $3000, it is completely unregulated and has been created anonymously.. It is not owned by the horrid federal reserve or bank of England it has the potential to be an incredibly powerful phenomenon. At first this prospect excited me, I thought this gave excellent hope to combating the banking dynasty. I felt really excited, an unregulated currency exceeding every paper currency there currently is. Bang, like a slap in the face.. Isn&#39;t this what the NWO requires a world currency that is fully paperless. Why would they leave the possibility of this hanging on a limb why would they not preempt the possibility of this happening. It adds up? Plus there&#39;s a video of Bill Gates saying bitcoin is Unstoppable. Opinions appreciated. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m on the fence myself but I was getting all excited about it then it hit me the possibility of it being controlled. If you&#39;ve ever heard of quantum prosessors apparently these have the ability to completely and easily decrypt any binory code we have and I seen this on a mainstream documenty around 5years ago.. So to think bitcoin can actually be protected from these phycopaths would surly be very naive of us. Why would they leave the possibility for this hanging. The more I think the more sense it makes that this is the paperless one world currency only it will be presented in away that makes us think it&#39;s actually in our favour an unregulated. It has extreme potential of power why would they let that be a possiblety. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I read an article on hackernoon.com that made the case for certain agencies already trying to control Bitcoin. The base code is where the magic happens, so if you can control the basecode that the network runs on, you can control Bitcoin at least to a certain extent.</p>

<p>But still this is very hard. I&#39;m actually quite impressed by Bitcoin. It&#39;s decentralized and has proven very safe up to now (if you know what you&#39;re doing).</p>

<p>And even if someone controls Bitcoin, there&#39;s hundreds of cryptocurrencies out there and some of them have better privacy features than Bitcoin.</p>

<p>The fact of the matter is, Bitcoin is an awesome invention that can&#39;t be stopped easily. P2P-networks are very resilient, just look at torrents. TPTB have tried to stop illegal downloading, but it never really worked as well as they hoped. Bitcoin is just as resilient.</p>

It&#39;s paperless and it has the potential to appeal to everyone. We need to think ahead of game here.. I bought into it at first but it makes sense, unowned unregulated currency. Na don&#39;t think paperless digital currency we&#39;ve been warned about maybe? Let me know opinions. It&#39;s just a thought. Thanks. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is that just how it&#39;s being presented to get everyone on board an unregulated currency that can be truley an ennonymous is everyone&#39;s wish. Everyone wants this which is why everyone( in different countrys) would get on board. Look into quantam prosessors, if your money is made of code there has to be away of someone can take control of it... Plus why would someone unknown create it. Surely it fits more into the NWO ideology.. Paperless, digital, international than some randomer after no personal gain creating a currency that has risen like no other by mistake. Check out how quickly it has risen in value and convenietly was created at the same time the West had a massive economic crash. Sounds too obvious to me</p>

<p>kinda but not really<br/>
To understand what i mean whit this one should understand the point einstein was making.<br/>
If u can track and trace all atoms and particles in the universe u can predict the future whit 100% accuracy.<br/>
Is bitcoin anonymous Yes kinda.<br/>
But sins its a public ledger it also kinda is not.<br/>
We can trace the coins trough the network ( from start to finish ) and if one of the receivers every buy,s or uses those coins it can be linked to them.<br/>
Its only anonymous wen its traded within the network and even that is not fool proof </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure it solves this problem - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault_tolerance">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault_tolerance</a>.  For every faulty blockchain copy you need 3 good ones (assuming synchronous communication) if this issue is accurately stated.  It&#39;s not my area of expertise - but my understanding is that if 50% of the blockchain instances are coopted then the blockchain can be rewritten.  Given that this happen asynchronously it smells funny that it&#39;s less than the 3/4 threshold for synchronous comm.  Someone who knows the math on this would be better suited to validate whether it solves this problem or not.  But off the bat having a lower threshold for async comm than for sync seems opposite of what one would expect.  So I&#39;m leaning towards thinking this byzantine general problem isn&#39;t solved by bitcoin.  Other than that the idea of using a chain (or a narrative, if you will) is good phi design.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it is quite the opposite.
Bitcoin transactions are incredibly hard to trace unless the nodes are owned by the one entity (which defeats the whole idea of what a crypto-currency is, so i don&#39;t see that happening.) I feel, if anything crypto-currencies will be our only way to fight back against a designated world/global currency.</p>

<p>Lets say for example the world follows Sweden&#39;s new chip implant program and allows only government verified currencies to be used in trade. Already we pretty much have a paperless currency and we most definitely have a traceable currency - all they need now is to put tracking chips in our wrists and pass them off as the new credit card - boom, world currency.</p>

<p>Bitcoin may be the only way to buy stuff outside of the government approved system.</p>

<p>I would love to discuss this with anybody who can poke holes through my theory.</p>
