It goes back at least when Saturn was our sun and probably even before that when you think about the true origin of humans. I feel like even if I dedicated my whole life to researching the conspiracies I could barely scratch the surface.</p>

<p>Due to my own knowledge, I do know I have what it takes to fight back, the fact they are so evil also motivates me. But I&#39;m also realistic about my chances of success. At the same time, all that responsability scares me a little.</p>

<p>And he said to me, “Do not seal up the words of the prophecy of this book, for the time is near.  Let the evildoer still do evil, and the filthy still be filthy, and the righteous still do right, and the holy still be holy.”</p>

<p>“Behold, I am coming soon, bringing my recompense, to repay every one for what he has done.  I am the Alpha and the Omega, the first and the last, the beginning and the end.”</p>

<p><strong>Blessed are those who wash their robes, that they may have the right to the tree of life and that they may enter the city by the gates.</strong>  Outside are the dogs and sorcerers and fornicators and murderers and idolaters, and every one who loves and practices falsehood.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nah, we can actually win. </p>

<p>First because people are already losing faith in the system, all we need for a massive change is a little push. This would perhaps be an open window in History. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s what i suggest; </p>

<p>Let&#39;s cut the conspiracy thing down to what it matters - That we are controlled and manipulated, make it a thing, sinthesize in a clear and objective way why and how things are fucked and what we can do about it. </p>

<p>Make it a <strong>godamn fucking movement</strong>, with a fucking name, but with no face, just to ensure nothing resembling &quot;positon of power&quot;. </p>

<p>Then my friends, let&#39;s <strong>Gandhi</strong> the fuck out of it -- Let&#39;s just stop -- Yeap. </p>

<p>The one thing we need is to all people around the earth to stop for one day. Or perhaps more. </p>

<p>This will show <strong>who the fuck is the actual boss, and runs all this shit down to the fucking all of it</strong>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look man, the answer is simple but the loudest causeheads will be the first to dismiss it:  Debt-free, Constitutional Cryptocurrency.  The government leases huge blocks of crypto to regional banks who accept those blocks in the form of paper currency.  Banks lends that paper (or further, digital representations of the physical paper) to businesses and individuals who then circulate the new currency simply by conducting their day-to-day transactions.</p>

<p>Of course, that would require President Trump have the political will and support of the people needed to abolish the Federal Reserve.</p>
