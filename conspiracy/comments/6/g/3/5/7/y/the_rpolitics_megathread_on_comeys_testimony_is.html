<p>No you trust this Harvard law professor.  Other such professors have said differently yet you don&#39;t give there views any credence so his postition as a Harvard law professor really doesn&#39;t appear to be the reason you agree with him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ignoring the obvious idiocy in saying the POTUS can&#39;t obstruct justice, what he <em>can</em> do and what is morally right and intelligent are two completely different things. Yes he can pardon people, that doesn&#39;t mean he should go around throwing them out to try to protect those loyal to him from justice. Also I&#39;ll point out you can&#39;t pardon something before an investigation and charge is pushed through, so trying to block an investigation isn&#39;t pardoning.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Care to point where he says that? </p>

<p>Ill just quote there here.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For those who didn&#39;t watch the testimony Comey made it clear the top people at the FBI had to have a discussion about this, because strictly speaking, the FBI is investigating Trumps Campaign, which Trump lead as it was his campaign. Comey admits that it is also reasonable to say that the President IS under an umbrella investigation via his campaign. But it&#39;s also possible to be very literal and claim the president himself is not explicitly under a limited investigation.</p>

<p>Direct quote
&quot;One of the members of the leadership team had a view that although it was technically true, we did not have a counter-intelligence file case open on then-President-elect Trump, his concern was that because we&#39;re looking at the potential — again that&#39;s the subject of the investigation — coordination between the campaign and Russia, because it was President Trump — President-elect Trump&#39;s campaign, this person&#39;s view was inevitably his behavior, his conduct will fall within the scope of that work. And so he was reluctant to make the statement that I made. I disagreed,&quot; Comey said. &quot;I thought it was fair to say what was literally true — there is not a counter-intelligence investigation of Mr. Trump — and I decided in the moment to say it given the nature of our conversation.&quot;</p>

<p>For those who did not watch, look at the very last line: Comey repeatedly testified that multiple conversations caught him so off guard he did what he could to end them the best way he could.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah I thought you were still talking about collusion.</p>

<p>So about obstruction, same argument. Care to show me the proof?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“I take the president at his word that I was fired because of the Russia investigation,” Mr Comey told the Senate Intelligence Committee in a public hearing. “Something about the way I was conducting it, the president felt, created pressure on him he wanted to relieve.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is pretty clear obstruction. Comey did say he wanted to stop short of making conclusions and will leave that for investigators. Since he is a private citizen now. </p>

<p>I mean, he&#39;s not the ONLY agent, right? There would be one or two others left after he was fired to continue the investigation. Right?</p>

<p>So how does removing one person from an investigation being performed by team of people obstruct said investigation?</p>

<p>It&#39;s not like he secreted evidence away that was key to the investigation that only he can access or offer up to the investigators.</p>

<p>Maybe it was a statement to others? &quot;Investigate me and I&#39;ll fire you.&quot; But he hasn&#39;t fired any other the other investigators has he?</p>

<p>Second and more importantly, the firing itself was not the entirety. He asked comey to drop the investigation, then fired him when he didn&#39;t. So firing the director didnt/wouldnt stop the investigation but asking the director to stop the investigation would stop the investigation(if the director followed what POTUS implied). The obstruction is this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Comey:&quot;..Commonsense told me that what&#39;s going on here is he&#39;s trying to get something here for granting me the chance to stay in my job.&quot; 
Question: &quot;Had the president got what he wanted and what he asked of you, what would have been the effect on the investigation?&quot; 
Comey: &quot;We would have dropped an open criminal investigation.&quot; 
Question: Do you believe you were fired over the russia investigation? &gt;Comey: &quot;Yes, because I&#39;ve seen the president say so&quot; 
Comey: &quot;And although the law required no reason at all to fire an FBI director, the administration then chose to defame me and more importantly the FBI by saying that the organization was in disarray, that is was poorly led - that the workforce had lost confidence in their leader. Those were lies, plain and simple.&quot;
KING: &quot;...when a president of the United States in the Oval Office says something like “I hope” or “I suggest” or — or “would you,” do you take that as a — as a — as a directive?&quot; 
COMEY: Yes. Yes, it rings in my ear as kind of, “Will no one rid me of this meddlesome priest?” 
KING: &quot;I was just going to quote that. In 1170, December 29, Henry II said, “Who will rid me of this meddlesome priest?” and then, the next day, he was killed — Thomas Becket. That’s exactly the same situation. You’re — we’re thinking along the same lines.&quot;</p>

<p>While it is entirely likely one led to the other, it seems there is little in the way of actionable illegal activities.</p>

<p>yes and for no reason too. But that has no bearing on obstruction. </p>

<p>I guess thats the disagreement. Comey says, in the quote above too, that he did.</p>

<p>Also, it does not require you to explicity say the task to actually count as obstruction. Merely trying to persuade someone is obstruction.</p>

<p>18 U.S. Code § 151</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;(b) Whoever knowingly uses intimidation, threatens, or corruptly persuades another person, or attempts to do so, or engages in misleading conduct toward another person, with intent to—
(1) influence, delay, or prevent the testimony of any person in an official proceeding;
(2) cause or induce any person to—
(A) withhold testimony, or withhold a record, document, or other object, from an official proceeding;
(B) alter, destroy, mutilate, or conceal an object with intent to impair the object’s integrity or availability for use in an official proceeding;
(C) evade legal process summoning that person to appear as a witness, or to produce a record, document, or other object, in an official proceeding; or
(D) be absent from an official proceeding to which such person has been summoned by legal process; or&quot;</p>

<p>Gaslighting is a form of manipulation that seeks to sow seeds of doubt in a targeted individual or members of a group, hoping to make targets question their own memory, perception, and sanity. Using persistent denial, misdirection, contradiction, and lying, it attempts to destabilize the target and delegitimize the target&#39;s belief.</p>

<p>I&#39;d appreciate you putting out this theory instead of linking to a fucking Wikipedia page that has no information or writing something like this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Russian fingerprints... In other words Anti-Putin Russian(Ukrainian(CIA)) fingerprints</p>
</blockquote>

<p>which is textbook gaslighting. </p>

<p>Now, let&#39;s read the article. Ctrl+F &quot;father&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Dmitri Alperovitch knows a thing or two about what the Russians call &quot;active measures,&quot; in which propaganda is used to undermine a target country&#39;s political systems. He was born in 1980 in Moscow, in an era when people were afraid to discuss politics even inside their homes. His father, Michael, was a nuclear physicist who barely escaped being sent to Chernobyl as part of a rescue mission in 1986. Many of Michael&#39;s close friends and colleagues died of radiation poisoning within months of flying to the burning power plant. The takeaway for Dmitri was that &quot;life is cheap in the Soviet Union.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<h2></h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Michael also taught Dmitri to code. Without a computer at home, Dmitri practiced by writing down algorithms on paper. In 1990, his father was sent to Maryland as part of a nuclear-safety training program for scientists. Per Soviet custom, Dmitri stayed in the USSR to ensure that his parents didn&#39;t defect. He lived with his grandparents, and when his parents returned, after a year, they brought him his first computer, an IBM PC.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2></h2>

<blockquote>
<p>In 1994, his father was granted a visa to Canada, and a year later the family moved to Chattanooga, where Michael took a job with the Tennessee Valley Authority. The work was not particularly challenging, so Michael began studying cryptography on the side. While Dmitri was still in high school, he and his father started an encryption-technology business. Dmitri says he loved the beauty of the math but also saw cryptography&#39;s fatal flaw: &quot;If someone stole your keys to encrypt the data, it didn&#39;t matter how secure the algorithms were.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<h2></h2>

<blockquote>
<p><del>Alperovitch studied computer science at Georgia Tech and went on to work at an antispam software firm. There he met a striking dark-haired computer geek named Phyllis Schneck. As a teenager, Schneck once showed her father that she could hack into the company where he worked as an engineer. Appalled, Dr. Schneck made his daughter promise never to do something like that again.</del></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oops, different father.</p>

<p>Hmm, nothing about CIA ties. Where are you getting that from?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why do you think the FBI wasn&#39;t allowed to access the servers?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No clue. Stop with the insinuation, and state your theories.</p>

Trumps bad</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why is the narrative that Trump is bad wrong given his behavior, what he wants to do, and his actions.  You do realize it is possible to think he isn&#39;t a decent president without being a shill or what ever today word  is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The one thing <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> doesn&#39;t want to talk about (and this sub apparently as well because I don&#39;t see anything on it from a quick glance) is this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In his Thursday testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee, former FBI director James B. Comey said that a controversial New York Times story in February about alleged contacts between Trump intimates and Russian officials was bogus.</p>

<p>“The challenge, and I’m not picking on reporters, about writing stories about classified information is the people talking about it often don’t really know what’s going on and those of us who actually know what’s going on are not talking about it,” said Comey during questioning from Sen. James Risch (R-Idaho). “And we don’t call the press and say, ‘Hey, you got that thing wrong.’ ”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That wasnt the claim of OP. I agree politics is 1-sided shit.Mostly cause of how reddit leans left. (and probably bots too)</p>

<p>OP claimed it was one of the most censored places on the internet. That is a HUGE exaggeration. It wouldnt even be the case on reddit. There&#39;s so many subs that have nazi mods. Meaning OP is factually incorrect.</p>

<p>And you are incorrect in saying T_D is for trump supporters about trump. The place is riddled with propaganda. And you cant propperly discuss trump cause anything that criticises him or his policies can get banhammered. Even he himself said it, as in he said it something couple months before and then does something else. A user mentions it and gets banned. They&#39;ll ban things against trump his policies even though most of the users were against his actions (remember the drugs thing). It&#39;s not a place to discuss trump. It&#39;s a place to get brainwashed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To be fair,</p>

<p>Reddit has always leaned left but r/politics was not heavily censored in the past. It is now though with downvote bots and timer restrictions for downvoted posters.</p>

<p>They don&#39;t outright delete to maintain the illusion of open discussion but the bots and timer restrictions achieve the same end in an undercover manner.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Would disagree. I&#39;m a great sample case of someone that historically was a frequent contributor at politics. For years that was one of my primarily subs to air out my thoughts on political events, disagree, debate, find which of my assumptions could be knocked down and rebuild my thoughts from stronger assumptions.</p>

<p>During the 2016 election the sub completely changed. No longer could I air out thoughts and learn from others. Any time I voiced something disagreeable personal attacks followed. That&#39;s it. No counter argument. No elaboration. Just attacks or reposted news articles light on detail but heavy on opinion. Stopped learning anything from that venue, point taken and moving on.</p>

<p>Over on T_D I can still disagree with people and have conversations where I&#39;m learning. They&#39;ve got giant road flares toward giant dumps of boring data so tedious to work through but where new knowledge comes from.</p>

<p>Everyone seems to have forgotten that one can be critical of the Democrat leadership and angry with them for the direction they&#39;ve taken the party, without necessarily being a Trump supporter or even a Republican. Much of the efforts on Reddit attack both types of individuals as if they&#39;re the same. As a Dem who feels the likes of Debbie Wasserman and Donna Brazile belong in a cell it&#39;s infuriating.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To be fair,</p>

<p>Politics sub changed their filtdring rules so they censorship is more undercover-- they have downvote bots punishing comments against the narrative, and then any posters in the sub with a net negative downvote history are penalised with an 8 minute timer per post. This effectively chills conversation and forces opposed views outwards.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Perhaps it would be fairer to say: reddit is overwhelmingly <em>socially</em> liberal. In very specific ways. In recent years, Republicans have pushed hard against those specific ways, making reddit more liberal practically out of necessity.

<p>Basically, the reddit &quot;hivemind&quot; isn&#39;t massively liberal so much as it is liberal in the ways that make one identify as liberal. </p>

<li><p>Be a great time to discuss options for Youtube as well--next year Youtube will be making a change and placing tons more ads on videos.

Problem is they are just starting out and only have approved a few submitters for content (including James Corbett).

    <div class="md"><p>OP seems mistaken about numbers of comments.</p>

<p>Reddit is indeed a site for members of the MSM.</p>

<p>There are bot accounts, there are shill accounts. That&#39;s besides the point.</p>

<p>&quot;MSM,&quot; main stream media, covers many groups. Including anyone in news, advertising, promotion of arts. Those are still broad categories themselves. The only thing someone needs to make a reddit account is an email address. The only thing someone needs for an email address, is a unique character set.</p>

<p>Given this, there is an extremely high possibility that people working in the mentioned fields not only have reddit accounts for work, but also for personal use. There&#39;s an obvious inherent bias on any website because of this. There is a equally good chance that the reason reddit is one of the most popular websites — It&#39;s in the top 10 almost anywhere you look — is because the MSM uses it so often.</p>

<p>Redit has probably always been a site for the MSM. As has pretty much the entire internet, for the majority of it&#39;s history at this point. The web is mostly porn, despite social stigma, porn is very MSM.</p>

<p>Use at least the same discretion online as you would watching anything on traditional TV.</p>

<p>So about obstruction, same argument. Care to show me the proof?</p>
