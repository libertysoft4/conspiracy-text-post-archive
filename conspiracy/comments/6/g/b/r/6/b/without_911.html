<p>Without 9/11 there would be no &quot;war on terror&quot;.</p>

<p>Without 9/11 there would be no war in Afghanistan.</p>

<p>Without 9/11 there would be no war in Iraq.</p>

<p>Without 9/11 there would be no war in… (insert any country classified as part of the &quot;axis of evil&quot; or defined as being &#39;with the terrorists&#39;)</p>

<p>Without 9/11 thousands of U.S. troops would not have been sent to their deaths.</p>

<p>Without 9/11 hundreds of thousands of citizens of Iraq and Afghanistan would not have been sentenced to their deaths.</p>

<p>Without 9/11 there would be no inaction on the Israeli-Palestinian peace process.</p>

<p>Without 9/11 there would be no civilian contractors in Iraq and the scandal that has followed them would have been averted.</p>

<p>Without 9/11 there would be no false military reporting (Pat Tillman, Jessica Lynch), and no crack down on the freedom of the press (banning photographing the returning coffins).</p>

<p>Without 9/11 there would be no Patriot Act.</p>

<p>Without 9/11 there would be no NSA warrant-less wiretapping program.</p>

<p>Without 9/11 there would be no Camp Delta and no Camp X-ray at Guantanamo Bay.</p>

<p>Without 9/11 there would be no Military Commissions Act and no coordinated program of extraordinary rendition, indefinite detention and torture of those defined as “enemy combatants”.</p>

<p>Without 9/11 there would be no vast increase in secrecy and complete militarization of intelligence under the newly created office of the Director of National Intelligence.</p>

<p>Without 9/11 there would not be thousands of dead and dying emergency workers who are suffering crippling and fatal respiratory illnesses.</p>

<p>Without 9/11 there would be no vast increase in military and security spending that goes arm in arm with huge cutbacks in other key social programs (such as levees in New Orleans).</p>

<p>Without 9/11 there would have been no total abandonment of fiscal restraint, which has contributed to plunging the nation into an abyss of debt and looks likely to tip the world into a deep recession if not a complete depression.</p>

<p>And on and on and on.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yup, you know what, I used to be one of those people who thought 9/11 truthers were retards. Ir wasn&#39;t until my history professor showed the Zeitgeist movie first day of class, not a particularly great documentary for 9/11 either, but it opened my eyes enough to explore more into it and question. For Christ sake, it was 9 years after 9/11 happened and I never even heard of WTC 7!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One great thing to bring up to these &quot;debunkers&quot; is that nobody ever looked for any form of explosives EVER. WTC 7 debris were hauled away ASAP. The twin tower debris..despite plenty of rescue crews reporting anomalies during clean up was never checked for anything . It sounds unbelievable but simple listen to NIST say it on video. They looked for no form of explosives. So how can one come to a conclusion either way?</p>

<p>NIST also won&#39;t release their WTC 7 model of the collapse because of public safety or whatever that means.</p>

<p>It&#39;s good to just show debunkers that much of their stuff is not based on science. First the towers collapsed due to the pancake theory then it was changed to the pile driver theory. They just throw shit out there and hope it sticks. </p>

<p>The media just throws out bullshit.</p>

<p>How hilarious is this video? So we found the pilots and terrorists with their clothes on in the cockpit..but no black box.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I&#39;m starting to think we should make black boxes out of terrorist&#39;s passports, as they always seem to find a few conveniently undamaged ones after any major incident. </p>

<p>If the black box was comprised entirely of identifying paperwork on someone from a country that&#39;s an official enemy of the USA, those things would be fucking invincible apparently.</p>

<p>So is monkey meat part of their regular diet? Is this a daily thing? A once a year thing? Once in a lifetime or never thing? Does monkey meat positively or negatively affect their health? Does this further imply that humans be eating other humans as part of a balanced diet?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have a funny path. First off, I planned to sign up for military on the 12th.  I felt so confused on the 11th that I never did. I even suggested to people that we should almost forget it happened. Not talk about it. Be ashamed as humanity. But that I also believed we had officials who would get to he bottom of it. I was actually really interested in mythology and atlantis. I took a 5 year break from the Internet after 9/11 mainly because I was poor. I bought books on atlantis and such. It wasn&#39;t until I could afford Internet in 2006/7 that I started searching online for atlantis. It wasn&#39;t long until I found a video about 9/11 and a stargate that I even heard there were arguments about the story. Which is about when the commission report came out. The commission report really is what stood out in the scheme of it. Add my confusion I felt almost since that day. I read everything after that and brought it up in every conversation I could. Unfortunately, I feel a lot of people probably felt like I did... &quot;let&#39;s not talk about it&quot;.. </p>

<p>I&#39;m a shut up now</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I actually came in here believing the narrative on 911, sandy hook, vaccines, fluoridation...shoot, I think all I believed was UFO stuff, and I was real picky about that. I will also say maybe we get a little bit more spam now, but the quality of the analysis and evidence has gotten much better over the years imho. Or, as I got more read into the stuff, maybe I just perceived it as more believable. Hmm, interesting thought. I think the quality got better all around though, and the evidence has stacked up on a lot of conspiracies. And sadly, UFO information hasn&#39;t really made much progress for a few years. </p>

<p>We all know by now that the real terrorists (the politicians in the suits and ties and the banksters that pull their strings) are waging their war of terror on multiple fronts for multiple reasons.</p>

<p>Domestically, it rallies the population around the flag, keeping the flock in check. At the same time it justifies the build up of the police state control grid to catch the thought criminals who resist.</p>

<p>It also writes a blank check for the illegal wars of aggression abroad. Simply place your terrorist boogeyman in the square of the chessboard you’re looking to occupy and — hey presto! — you’ve got yourself an excuse to invade. (Even if you “accidentally” end up supporting them, right Uncle Sam?)</p>

<p>But of course the politicians, their string pullers and their fellow travelers benefit from the war of terror in a more straightforward sense. They get to use the terror scares that they themselves create to drum up billions upon billions in the name of fighting the boogeymen.</p>

<p>We’ve all heard of the $640 toilet seat and other ridiculous examples of Pentagon “overspending,” but these stories tend to trivialize the abuses by the military-defense contractors whose entire industry is built on providing overpriced solutions to made up problems. After all, the Pentagon itself just admitted it could cut $2 billion from its budget by shutting down some of the needless bases and defense facilities that have been built around the globe in the name of the American empire.</p>

<p>But $2 billion is chump change.</p>

<p>In the 15 years since 9/11, $1 trillion has been spent building up the police state in the American “homeland” itself.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Defense Department has been spending over $600 billion per year maintaining the American military in the post-9/11 era. $4 to $6 trillion of that was spent on the Iraq and Afghanistan wars alone, the most expensive wars in US history.</p>

<p>Combined defense spending, including Homeland Security, DoD, State Department, defense related debt interest and other defense costs, has reached the highest levels in modern history over the past decade. From a Cold War era high in the 1980s of $3500 for every man, woman and child in the United States to a 1990s low of $2500, that figure has since breached $4000. Just look at the chart; it isn’t hard to see exactly when the trend reversed and the good times began to flow for the military-industrial contractors: It was 9/11, the birthday of the war of terror and the new era of homeland security.</p>

<p>There are other numbers we could throw in here:</p>

<p>The billions upon billions in military aid sent to the co-perpetrators of the war of terror, including the $38 billion that has been promised Israel over the next 10 years.</p>

<p>The $1.5 trillion joke known as the F-35 fighter jet.</p>

<p>The $6.5 trillion of “year-end adjustments” in the ongoing, never-ending saga of the Pentagon’s missing trillions.</p>

<p>But we have to be careful not to fall into the psychopaths’ trap. The real costs of the war of terror cannot be measured in dollars and cents. They are not tallied in a ledger. They are not about money at all.</p>

<p>The real cost is paid in blood. The blood of a million dead Iraqis. The blood of the hundreds of thousands murdered men, women and children in Afghanistan and Pakistan. The blood that is being shed right now in Syria, in Libya, in Yemen, and in all of the countries that have crossed through the crosshairs of the NATO, American and Israeli terrorists.</p>

<p>It’s measured in the devastation of towns and cities that once bustled with life. In the families torn apart by drone bombings. In the havoc of the hundreds of thousands forced to flee their homes, leave their families and their homeland and their former life behind as everything they knew is torn to shreds.</p>

<p>It’s measured in the blood of the servicemen and women themselves. Lied to, propagandized and indoctrinated their entire lives, given a ticket out of grinding poverty by the military, shot up with experimental vaccines and shoved into the meat grinder for tour of duty after tour of duty. And then, upon returning home, left to rot in rundown hospitals and ignored by the glad-handing politicians and their military-industrial cronies as a suicide epidemic gradually thins their ranks.</p>

<p>This is the true cost of the war of terror, and it is incalculable. And none of it, absolutely none of it, will come to an end until the public stops believing the false narrative of the war of terror and the lies that have brought it about.</p>

<p>Much like Santa Claus and the Easter bunny, the real terrorists can only survive if you believe in them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clash_of_Civilizations">Clash of Civilizations</a> precedes 9/11 by many years.  In fact, by 1998, Fukuyama (who wrote the book that it was in direct response/opposition to) also began carving out the same familiar space for military conflict with &#39;Islamic fundamentalism&#39; - see <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/fukuyama-end-end-history-88537">Newsweek</a> for a quick summary, and went on to be a founding member of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_for_the_New_American_Century">PNAC</a>.  Fukuyama and Huntington laid out the plans and rationales for the rapidly converging political left and right from the time of the Reagan administration on till Huntington&#39;s death, always drumming for war with &#39;Islam&#39; (next up China! (or a Russo-Sino alliance)).</p>

<p>One might almost be led to believe that without the Clash of Civilizations, there would have been no 9/11.</p>

<p>I&#39;m gonna argue this one though. The Israeli/Palestinian thing has been going on since 1948. It predates 9/11 and there has never been any progress towards a real solution. </p>

<p>I could speculate on the reason why, but that would just start an argument.</p>

<p>Not discounting other anomalies that are interesting too. The story about firemen seeing the black boxes get carried away. But that&#39;s an anecdote. I didn&#39;t see it myself as I did with the plane. </p>

Either way is shitty</p>
