    <div class="md"><p>He didn&#39;t. Mere presidents don&#39;t have the power to make those determinations. If anything, he leveraged to stem the tide of Wahabbism by helping to embolden Iran through support of the nuclear arms agreement. It&#39;s one thing I&#39;ve learned to respect about his presidency, though I have considered that it may have been an agreement set up for failure, based on the absolutely terrible PR campaign unable to substantiate a single undeniable benefit to the US taxpayer, which seemed possibly intentional. </p>

<p>His Secretaries of State on the other hand, die hard neocons, only worked towards the already entrenched system of support for the Israeli/Saudi backing of the Wahabbi terrorists.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m under no illusions America is unfair and that is what was supposedly supposed to make it great. Trump was born with golden spoons in his mouth. My mother came to America from a Native American reservation with nothing. She went to college and is still struggling in this capitalist society. Remember the &quot;small loan of a million dollars&quot; from Trump?</p>

<p>I&#39;m probably a communist/socialist but at this point in time and human history we need wageslaves until we can replace what I call the &quot;lower class&quot; (farmers, not as a inferior but the lower part of the pyramid to build civilization) with robots or basically engineers to control them who will be middle class. </p>

<p>Then we can take everything from the rich and all humans can live comfortably without profit because we will be focused on maintaining the technology to feed us.</p>

<p>Just my views, I don&#39;t know shit. I really don&#39;t think any of the news should hinder Trump in any fashion. He has a republican congress and house and they rolled back bank regulations so you can have that drained swamp.</p>

<p>Comey said &quot;the content of the memo&quot;. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>AMES COMEY, FORMER FBI DIRECTOR: The president tweeted on Friday, after I got fired, that I better hope there&#39;s not tapes. I woke up in the middle of night on Monday night because it didn&#39;t dawn on me originally that there might be corroboration for a conversation, there might be a tape. And my judgment was, I needed to get that out into the public square and so <strong>I asked a friend of mine to share the content of the memo with a reporter</strong>. I didn&#39;t do it myself for a variety of reasons, but I asked him to because I thought that might prompt the appointment of a special counsel. And so I asked a close friend of mine to do it.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the bolded bit. Bolded means dark black. Here, I&#39;ll write it out by itself:</p>

<p>Comey testified under oath: &quot;<strong>I asked a friend of mine to share the content of the memo with a reporter</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>Trump has tried to influence or prevent Comey providing documentation or testifying before congress which means he is doing the same during an official proceeding. Congressional hearings are official proceedings, talking to a friend who then talks to a journalist is not.</p>

<p>Not true. </p>

<p>Perjury: Perjury is the intentional act of swearing a false oath or of falsifying an affirmation to tell the truth, whether spoken or in writing, concerning matters material to an official proceeding.</p>

<p>You are not &quot;giving citations right from the US Code&quot; in regards to perjury, you made up a convenient definition. You then falsely assume your 1 and 2.</p>

<p>If he had released the &quot;content of the memo&quot; before the tweet, then he struck the first blow and Trump&#39;s tweet is in response. He is completely misleading and </p>

<p>There really is no question about this, so I find it hard to understand the mindset of someone who tries to deflect. I find it fitting that those who try to deflect falsely describe &quot;perjury&quot; and then try to gain authority by saying they are citing criminal code.</p>

<p>Yes, exactly. Congressional hearings are. Where Comey was under oath. And then lied about the reason and date of leaking the &quot;content of the memo&quot;. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not &quot;my&quot; definition. If you don&#39;t understand that Comey was under oath and giving testimony yesterday, or are trying to deliberately mislead, then why bother talking to you?</p>

<p>You have nothing to add. It&#39;s a clear cut case of perjury. The content of the memo was released on May 11th and Trump tweeted in response to it on May 12th. Comey deliberately made it seem as he had made a defensive move, when in fact it was a leak to attack Trump. End of story.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m under no illusions America is unfair and that is what was supposedly supposed to make it great. Trump was born with golden spoons in his mouth. My mother came to America from a Native American reservation with nothing. She went to college and is still struggling in this capitalist society. Remember the &quot;small loan of a million dollars&quot; from Trump?</p>

<p>I&#39;m probably a communist/socialist but at this point in time and human history we need wageslaves until we can replace what I call the &quot;lower class&quot; (farmers, not as a inferior but the lower part of the pyramid to build civilization) with robots or basically engineers to control them who will be middle class. </p>

<p>Then we can take everything from the rich and all humans can live comfortably without profit because we will be focused on maintaining the technology to feed us.</p>

<p>Just my views, I don&#39;t know shit. I really don&#39;t think any of the news should hinder Trump in any fashion. He has a republican congress and house and they rolled back bank regulations so you can have that drained swamp.</p>
