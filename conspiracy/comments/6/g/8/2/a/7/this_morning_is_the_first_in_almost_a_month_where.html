    <div class="md"><p>Lies. I just posted where he explicitly said it was direction. Feel free to post any part of the transcript that you say is different. Just for shits and giggles though, here is is repeating the fact just minutes later.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>FEINSTEIN: OK. Let’s — let’s go to the Flynn issue.</p>

<p>Senator Risch outlined a — “I hope you could see your way (sic) to letting Flynn go. He’s a good guy. I hope you can let this go.”</p>

<p>But you also said, in your written remarks, and I quote, that you had “understood the president to be requesting that we drop any investigation of Flynn in connection with false statements about his conversations with the Russian ambassador in December,” end quote.FEINSTEIN: Please go into that with more detail.</p>

<p>COMEY: Well, the — the context and the president’s words are what led me to that conclusion.</p>

<p>As I said in my statement, I could be wrong, but Flynn had been forced to resign the day before, and — and the controversy around General Flynn at that point in time was centered on whether he had lied to the vice president about the nature of his conversations with the Russians, whether he had been candid with others in the course of that.</p>

<p>And so that happens on the day before. On the 14th, the president makes specific reference to that. And so that’s why I understood him to be saying that what he wanted me to do was drop any investigation connected to Flynn’s account of his conversations with the Russians</p>

<p>But we get it, that you are trying to exaggerate what was not actually said about the Flynn investigation, where Comey as a skilled court room testifying by trade, that he didn&#39;t think that Trump did anything wrong, but it was &quot;concerning&quot;, and he didn&#39;t think it was his place to say something, but he went on about his &#39;feelings&#39; on the matter.</p>

<p>Everyone is entitled to their opinions, and if there&#39;s one thing EVERY one of us should do, it&#39;s question everything. Unfortunately here, you were wrong, and I&#39;d like to ask one more question / make one more point. You started this statement referring to the crime obstruction of justice, did you not?!? Well I agree, it IS in fact a crime and it SHOULD in fact be punished! Unfortunately, that doesn&#39;t really apply here. Where it did apply was when the FBI subpoenaed Hillary for her e-mails, and we remember how that went down! What tune were you singing that day!?!?
SOOO many people today have fallen victim to the propaganda and their antics / motive. People form such strong allegiances to a single person and their ideologies that they not only lose sight of their own individuality, but their ability to use critical thinking. They&#39;re brainwashed into thinking the opposition is fundamentally flawed and uneducated. That&#39;s my favorite, when people use the &#39;I&#39;ve done so much research and am so passionate about this, you just don&#39;t understand!&#39; What they really mean is they play their particular allegiances&#39; news station all day and have been thoroughly brainwashed. BOTH sides are bad right now, an apart from a few ethical issues and fluff arguments, both sides are piece of the same thing. Neither side gives a fuck about you, or anybody else who&#39;s not a part of the 0.0001% elites. <a href="/u/quillpryde">/u/quillpryde</a>, come on bro, you clearly allocate a lot of time and energy into politics, as evident from your post history, learn to be a part of the solution and separate yourself from them, cause they&#39;re not like you, never have been and never will be! I know people hate when this comment is said, and it&#39;s regularly mocked, but I feel it&#39;s justified here. So <a href="/u/quillpryde">/u/quillpryde</a>, are a sheep.</p>

<p>Do you know of any case where a person has been charged for obstruction of justice or, for that matter, any other criminal offense, where this — they said, or thought, they hoped for an outcome?</p>

<p>COMEY: I don’t know well enough to answer. And the reason I keep saying his words is I took it as a direction.</p>

<p>And then minutes later he reiterated the same point again.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>FEINSTEIN: OK. Let’s — let’s go to the Flynn issue.</p>

<p>Senator Risch outlined a — “I hope you could see your way (sic) to letting Flynn go. He’s a good guy. I hope you can let this go.”</p>

<p>But you also said, in your written remarks, and I quote, that you had “understood the president to be requesting that we drop any investigation of Flynn in connection with false statements about his conversations with the Russian ambassador in December,” end quote.FEINSTEIN: Please go into that with more detail.</p>

<p>COMEY: Well, the — the context and the president’s words are what led me to that conclusion.</p>

<p>As I said in my statement, I could be wrong, but Flynn had been forced to resign the day before, and — and the controversy around General Flynn at that point in time was centered on whether he had lied to the vice president about the nature of his conversations with the Russians, whether he had been candid with others in the course of that.</p>

<p>And so that happens on the day before. On the 14th, the president makes specific reference to that. And so that’s why I understood him to be saying that what he wanted me to do was drop any investigation connected to Flynn’s account of his conversations with the Russians</p>

<p>He came right out and said Trump asked and directed him to stop the investigation, because according to Comey&#39;s account of the situation, he definitely did. </p>

Given how long these things generally take, there is a possibility that Mueller won&#39;t come to a conclusion until after the midterms next year, in which case there&#39;s a possibility the Dems will hold the house and won&#39;t waste any time drafting the articles of impeachment.</p>

<p>Of course, if Trump does actually testify under oath, this could all happen a lot sooner, as I&#39;m sure he&#39;ll perjure himself a half dozen times in his opening statement alone. </p>
