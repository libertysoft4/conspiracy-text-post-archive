    <div class="md"><p>I hear you.  The DomU vms don&#39;t have to be fedora.  There are debian templates too, and you can run HVM that isn&#39;t paravirtualized but runs directly on the hardware, allowing you to use any OS.  My experience is that the &quot;hack attacks&quot; I&#39;d experience seemed to stop when I went to Qubes particularly on the latest release.  Prior to that I was testing out all sorts of different OS&#39;s and I&#39;d find that the machines were getting compromised very quickly.  The tell on this was the speed of the machine.  I even tried putting hardware firewalls on non-intel chipsets (building them with openwrt or using specifically designed firewall oses) to put a physical layer in between my box and the internet.  Disabling wifi/bluetooth (by physically opening the machines up and removing the radios) and using ethernet only.  Even &quot;safe&quot; oses like openbsd would get compromised quickly.  All of that went away when I went on Qubes.  The added benefit was that if a vm smelled of compromise I could shutdown the vm.  There were a bunch of different tactics that could be used to reduce the compromise smells with Qubes that I couldn&#39;t find anywhere else.  For instance keeping a vm that&#39;s completely airgapped and using the Qubes interdomain copy mechanisms to move files from the vms that had network stack.</p>

<p>On other vectors.. What I figure one of the risks is running x86 chips.  Purism has done a lot on removing intel ME on their machines.  Otherwise you&#39;ll have to get a machine (generally a limited set of thinkpads) where you can safely run the scripts to deblob ME.  This imo is the likely vector for the badbios attacks (maybe thru the microcode patches??).  AMD is no different but the compromised chips might be a little newer.  Newer than 2007 is more or less the threshold for this vector.  Otherwise look for machines that don&#39;t have a bios (arm chips, but be very careful which hardware you select).  Turning sound and mic off to avoid the airgap hacks that use these exploits.  Qubes is great at handling this vector too because of how they layer the device access.   </p>

<p>Redhat/Fedora also have Saturnian logos.  Hats, brims, red and black.  Those are weird smells.  Reasonably sure of the nix trees debian and that whole line (Ubuntu, Trisquel, etc) are also compromised.  The bsds are also fucked.  Doesn&#39;t leave a lot of room.  Maybe the declarative stuff, nixos etc. will be tighter and less compromised if you know what you&#39;re doing.  Chromeos only if you can get non-compromised hardware (wouldn&#39;t trust anything from google, although there was one release of chromeos by hexxen that had some interesting smells that it might not have been as backdoored).  Sounds nutty but I&#39;m using everything at my disposal, nutty or not.  Throwing the proverbial kitchen sink at it.       </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Everything&quot; is a bit broard.<br/>
I usually allow the original site I visit (e.g. reddit.com), but disallow any 3rd party scripts. Sometimes I have to allow content providers (youtube.com, for embedded vids), or secondary domains (redditcdn.com (does not exist, just an example)), but the big no-nos keep being blocked. (e.g. adsense.com, doubleclick.com, etc)  </p>

<p>Ghostery is another nice anti-tracking add-on.<br/>

    <div class="md"><p>You can block everything. Problem is that most sites won&#39;t work anymore. And content that is native (not a product of some script) will still show up. It&#39;s just like blocking commercials on TV. Native ads can&#39;t be blocked. When it&#39;s part of the program it can&#39;t be filtered. Sites using third parties to provide services are a big problem. There is no trust relationship but it must be allowed in order to get the content. Adservers put whatever they want, and sometimes it&#39;s malware. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve never heard of either of these sites. What make them good and how can I use them to my advantage?  I was using DDG, but I&#39;m always open to the most secure searches. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There seems to be a conceited effort to get people to use DDG vs Google due to security concerns. If security concerns are you motivation DDG is not the solution. DDG is based in the US and therefore within the reach of the NSA making your web searches on DDG not secure. You best bet is to use <a href="http://ixquick.eu">ixquick.eu</a> (source of StartPage.com) or even better run your own local copy of <a href="http://searx.me">searX</a> and control your own search logs.</p>
