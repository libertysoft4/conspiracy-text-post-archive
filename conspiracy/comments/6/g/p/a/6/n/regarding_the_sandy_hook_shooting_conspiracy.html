<p><a href="http://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2016/01/06/gun-violence-survivors-jillian-soto-origwx-jm-ar.cnn">http://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2016/01/06/gun-violence-survivors-jillian-soto-origwx-jm-ar.cnn</a></p>

<p>In the video, the sister of slain teacher Victoria Soto is speaking about how gun violence took the life of her sister. The video begins &quot;my life was affected by gun violence on December 12th, 2014&quot;</p>

<p>The shooting, however, took place on December 14th, 2012. </p>

<p>Whats going on here, a simple mis speak? If so, why has cnn failed to acknowledge the mistake for a year and a half now? Seemed strange to me when i watched it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, it isn&#39;t. </p>

<p>On 9/11 you can find people who claim they saw no planes. That means nothing really. You can find people who might claim the JFK assassination was on a different day - people are not reliable on these things individually. This should be obvious.</p>

<p>So, given what the op said, why would anyone at all think that because one person said something vs all the others who did that it means anything at all?</p>

<p>A person, under stress, in front of cameras, lack of sleep possibly, etc shouldn&#39;t be basis on which you address a conspiracy. </p>

<p>How about the section where the State Police claim that Soto was no hero...didn&#39;t try top save any students and was apparently caught by surprise even tho the school was apparently filled with the sound of automatic gun fire?</p>

<p>The report is 6000 pages and you spent a few hours pawing through it. So you covered, what....400 pages?</p>

<p>Shit...  the part about &quot;The Hum&quot; was the most interesting part of those files... everything else looks to be pretty much by the book.

    <div class="md"><p>The fact that a tragedy is exploited for political gain does not mean it did not happen. Just the logistics of something that big, it would literally make no sense, just wait for a real one and exploit it, not like they don&#39;t happen all the time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think this can easily be attributed to a mental flubb, with no definitive way to prove otherwise. But nice catch.</p>

<p>It reminds me of my wife&#39;s bday. I know it is Nov 3rd, but when asked I always say Nov 4th. Just now, I wrote it backwards and realized I did the actual thing I&#39;m talking about and had to correct it haha.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nah I didn&#39;t see the part where the State Police call anyone liars... Shit... I wish I could remember that fucknuts name that was all wacked out and off the deep end about Sandy Hook. Y&#39;all would be BFFs I think. </p>

<p>Shit...  the part about &quot;The Hum&quot; was the most interesting part of those files... everything else looks to be pretty much by the book. I bring it up cause I seen a lot of people go all tinfoil on Sandy Hook here... but never did anyone bring up &quot;The Hum&quot; I figgered someone would get a kick out of it. </p>
