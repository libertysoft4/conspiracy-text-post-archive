<p>The comments in this video spoke of mind control based on stimulation of the pineal gland through sodomy</p>

<p>Comment below:</p>

<p>The “Rite of Sodomy” “The Rite of Sodomy” is the central tenet of Trauma Based Mind Control programs,TBMC, promoted and popularised by Alistair Crowley, whereby the children/ trainee slaves are sodomised with dildos or other implements in order to manually manipulate nerve endings at the base of the spine, which stimulate the pineal gland, the master gland/ third eye, the CENTRE OF PSYCHIC AWARENESS IN THE HUMAN MIND, giving the subject flashes of cosmic consciousness, allowing the Master/Handler to &quot;bind and control&quot; their &quot;slave&quot;..<a href="http://www.whale.to/b/knox1.html%C2%A0THE">http://www.whale.to/b/knox1.html THE</a> PINEAL GLAND PHYSICALLY AFFECTS EVERY SYSTEM IN THE HUMAN BODY AND HAS THE POTENTIAL TO DETERMINE THE EXPANSION AND CONTRACTION OF PSYCHIC AWARENESS, CONSCIOUSNESS AND EXPERIENCE OF DIVINITY. The Satanic, Luciferian, occult, sexual abuse, hypnotism, etc. aspects of the TBMC programs help to obscure the significance of the central tenet of TBMC which is the&quot; Rite of Sodomy,&quot;</p>

<p>This link leads to an extensive interview with an alleged deprogrammer.</p>

<p>I bring forward Freuds Abandoned Theory of Seduction. According to the theory, a repressed memory of an early childhood sexual abuse or molestation experience was the essential precondition for certain mental conditions.</p>

<p>he was surprised that in all cases, the father, had to be accused of being perverse... surely such widespread perversions against children are not very probable...</p>

<p>&quot;The Work that lies ahead may be described symbolically as the marriage of the Beast and the Woman, the formula of which I have attempted to explain. Its hieroglyph is the Eleventh Key of the Book of Thoth. In the union of electrochemical and stellar vibrations represented by Babalon and the Beast, lies the key to the next stage in the advancement of evolution upon this planet. It will be achieved by a willed congress with extra-terrestrial entities of which, in a sense, Aiwaz is the immediate messenger to humanity...&quot;</p>

<p>Schizophrenia is the most poorly understood mental illness, ahead of OCD. </p>

Ive seen her &quot;short circuit&quot; and start talking like shes at work (waitress) same tone of voice, facial expression, everything. Very intrusive and negative voices.</p>

<p>Weed doesn&#39;t really get her high it just brings a sense of calmness and quites the voices. But i believe calmness is in itself as healthy as medecine.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s all very connected. As someone who has spent loads of time on voats pizzagate forum the pineal gland comes up regularly In regards to ritual abuse. What the exact connection is can only be theorised by us non-enlightened, but theories range from what you have said, to the pineal gland being eaten after sacrifice to produce a DMT high. </p>

<p>Max spiers in his final interview before his assassination spoke of the kundalani, and how raping a child before the age of 4 would &quot;unlock&quot; its potential and split the mind in two, allowing for a manufactured alter persona. Interesting, and ultra disturbing stuff.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Figure I&#39;ll write it in here instead of a separate thread.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been taking 900~mcg of nascent iodine for the last 2 months because i heard it can replace chemical bonds in the pineal gland of chloride/fluoride/bromide. If nothing else, most people are iodine deficient since most have been removed from salt now, and bread a while ago. I also supplement Selenium with it since I read it could cause an auto immune disease in way higher doses (1mg a day is considered safe). I wanted to know others thoughts on it.</p>

<p>Just from my experience, my dreams are very long now (even 2 hours feels like 6) and reflect reality more than fiction. It&#39;s not really a placebo effect because every single night now feels like going to a slightly different reality and living a life, and this hasn&#39;t happened before i started.</p>
