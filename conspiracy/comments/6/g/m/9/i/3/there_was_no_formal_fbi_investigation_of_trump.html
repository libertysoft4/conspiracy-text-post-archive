    <div class="md"><p>Thanks.   The level of secrecy exerted against the people is a defining factor in the advance of democratic principles.   Its primary possibly legitimate constraint is national security against foreign threats,  but the Macheavelian principles advocate secrecy and strategies to conspire as politically justified strategies that have infected and corrupted again and again and need to be addressed.    Right now,  its legal to pay off politicians,  so the three branches of executive,  legislative and judicial are joined by the fourth branch,  a corrupt media and a fifth branch,  the corporations and there billion dollar army of lobbyists.    What you and I can find out about what is going on is not what the average American is thinking is going on.</p>

<p>Comey was the top law enforcement officer in the nation before he was fired on May 9. Had he felt a special counsel was necessary to investigate possible Russian influence in the 2016 election, he could have requested one from Congress at any time. If he felt his conversations with President Trump warranted additional attention, he could have approached Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein about it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah,  it means Comey didn&#39;t think it worth doing.   The FBI is not the one recommending it.   Congress is doing it out a partisan witch hunt based on something they claim to know that the FBI evidently is not privy to,  or has been told not to.</p>

<p>Sure lets have an investigation,  but of what?    Nothing we know of so far is substantial evidence that the Russian federation had an effect on the electoral outcome,  and the efforts they made were pretty much restricted to some coverage on RT maybe.    </p>

I have, however, seen pretty much equal amounts of Trump supporters and non-supporters characterize it as &#39;Trump colluding with Russia.&#39; One side does it because they want to believe, the other because they don&#39;t. But I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever seen the press claim Trump himself was being investigated. What evidence is there that Comey&#39;s statements don&#39;t line up with media reporting? </p>

<p>are you forgetting that the primary was stolen from Bernie?    There was all kinds of rigging.   Governments all over the world were openly attacking Trump.    I am sorry Trump won,   Bernie would have beat him.   Right now to play into this circus is to sympathize with Shillary and the Trump derangement syndrome.    We know he&#39;s a crook.   We know Hillary was a crook.   We know Pence will be a crook.    What we need to do is outlaw bribery by corporations which is now guilded into law,  endorsed by the fucking Supreme Court of treasonous shills.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The so called investigation of the Trump campaign is BS in light of what really caused Hillary to lose.   And fuck her,  it the country and you and me that lost.   We have to live with Trump or Pence for at least 4 years when we could have had Bernie who would have beaten Trump.   Whatever the Trump campaign did,  its nothing worse than what the Hillary campaign did,  when you think about the Clinton Foundation taking millions from foreign countries who then dictate US policy.    I doubt Trump&#39;s group was up to that level or beyond it.    So throw Trump in jail,  great,  but after Hillary is already dressed in orange.   She was first,   running her scam from her office at the Department of State,  not some gold plated mafia hangout hotel.</p>

<p>why didn&#39;t Comey mention the Trump campaign investigations in October</p>
</blockquote>

<p>when did Comey first have reason to go after Flynn?    Comey was trying to save the Hillary campaign in October.    Yeah,  the democrats were furious with him,  but essentially he let Hillary off with a light hand slap.    The part the democrats didn&#39;t like was that Comey was trying to save his own ass from being complicit in her crimes.    Saying she was off the hook when the Weiner laptop had been looked at by the NY office was just not possible,  not even for Comey.    After all,  look,  he has been in a position up to being fired where he could still serve Hillary and Obama.</p>

<p>The MSM is doing the CIA&#39;s bidding.    Yes they are a swamp,   but there is an even bigger swamp behind what they are doing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are just muddling up the conservation with your opinion.  </p>

<p>You don&#39;t  mention why it took the FBI so long to get the Wiener laptop from NY Police? </p>

<p>Here is what the FBI knew about the Trump/Campaign and Russia before October.  </p>

<p><strong>July 8</strong></p>

<p>Carter Page, who is now on Trump&#39;s campaign team and who the FBI is investigating for potentially being a Russian spy (more on that later), gives a speech in Moscow where he says the US should be a little more friendly with Russia. He says he was there as a private citizen, not as a member of the Trump campaign.</p>

<p><strong>July 18</strong></p>

<p>The Republican National Convention aka the GOP&#39;s Coachella kicks off in Cleveland. Kislyak, the Russian ambassador to the US, makes a cameo appearance. And meets with a few Trump campaign officials, including Page and Jeff Sessions. PS: schmoozing with political officials is basically an ambassador&#39;s job description, so meetings like this aren’t necessarily unusual.</p>

<p>But during this convention, Team Trump convinces the GOP to roll back its policies toward helping Ukraine -- a longtime US ally -- fight a pro-Russia separatist movement in the country. This is pretty much the only party platform issue the Trump campaign weighs in on.
<strong>August</strong></p>

<p>Secret handwritten docs are found in Ukraine, showing Manafort was paid by the pro-Russian Ukrainian political party that ended up winning the presidential election there. It’s unclear if the docs are legit and if Manafort actually received that money. Investigators in Ukraine say the docs are part of their investigation into the party&#39;s illegal activities. A few days later, Manafort resigns as Trump&#39;s campaign manager.</p>

<p><strong>September</strong></p>

<p>Kislyak meets with then-senator Sessions at his office on Capitol Hill. Sessions later says this meeting was just a coffee date and not related to the Trump campaign. And that it wasn’t unusual for him to meet with ambassadors in his role on the Senate Armed Services Committee. The Washington Post later asks all 26 members of the committee whether they also ever met with Kislyak in 2016. The 20 who respond say &#39;nope.&#39;
<strong>October</strong></p>

<p>Less than two weeks to go until Election Day, Comey decides to send Congress a postcard saying the FBI is reviewing new evidence related to its investigation into Clinton&#39;s private email server. Thanks Anthony Weiner.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In other words,  an innuendo witch hunt is all you got.    Compare that to what they have as PROOF of what Hillary and Huma did.   You gonna blame that on Weiner?    Come on man,  the buck stops on Hillary,  not Weiner.   Weiner just was a convenient scapegoat who needed a bargaining chip.</p>

<p>Bernie could have won against Trump.    Hillary could only cheat her way to anything.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah,  well when you see the checks,  let me know.   In the meantime,  if you want to see some real cashed checks look to the Clinton Foundation!</p>

<p>The liberals are going to end up,  because of Trump derangement syndrome,  actually helping the conservatives by looking crazy.    Flynn,  Sessions are innocent until proven guilty.   You sound like someone who doesn&#39;t believe in America,  unless you look at Salem.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Ukraine&quot; was always part of Russia and so was Georgia for much of the time.</p>

<p>Also,  Syria has been a Russian ally for ages.   So,  you come across as an uneducated war hawk talking about &quot;let them eat Europe&quot; when they have always been invaded from Europe by Napoleon and Hitler costing over 6 million lives.</p>

<p>Americans are 1 in 20 humans,  and America could have been a good neighbor and not killed 2 million in Vietnam for nothing and nearly as many in the Middle East for nothing.   America is the one who needlessly used nuclear bombs against innocent civilians in Japan and started the cold war.   Yes,  the Soviet Union used to tinker around here and there,  but nothing compared to the US.</p>

<p>Its like the US calling Iran belligerent when they haven&#39;t started a war in over 200 years.</p>

<p>Russia, China,  India,  Brazil,  Indonesia,  Nigeria,   in the long run,  they are going to rise relative to the US.    What do you think this is a game of Risk?    How is it going to turn out?    At the current rate,  a smoldering dead planet,  burned out by nuclear weapons.   But if we are lucky,   both the US and Russia will gradually become a lot more like Scandanavia or Switzerland.    But people like you need to stop making up lies to justify military supremacy.   Its overly paranoid.   The US would be a lot stronger if we fixed a lot of stuff we have been postponing.    Also the economic and political model needs some tweeking or its also on the path of self destruction.   It won&#39;t be Russia that takes us down,  but ourselves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The differences between Bush Jr and Obama are very minor in my book,  policy wise,  so the suicide rate is something they are both sharing in,  but my point was,  its obviously something that happened to those guys or something they saw that pushed them over to suicide.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t see the difference between an innocent American life and an innocent Libyan,  Syrian,  Iraqi, whatever life,  personally.    I am not ok with using war as we have in the Middle East,  in Vietnam or in Hiroshima or Nagasaki.    I mean when Russia did something similar in Afghanistan,  that was BS,  right?   If Russia did that to Poles or Hungarians,  that would be BS,  right?   So why is it ok when we do it?    It turns out it wasn&#39;t for self defense,  not at all!   And its barbaric on a scale that is hard to imagine.   Hence the suicides.</p>

<p>The video was Hillary cackling over her &quot;great success&quot; in Libya which was a war crime for which she and her boss should face a tribunal.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know who you are,  what you are about but it is alarming to see us demonizing the Russians when they are not on our borders or any Nato member borders doing what we are doing on their borders.</p>

<p>The Russia hate is based on misinformation and propaganda on the scale of the so called weapons of mass destruction that Saddam did not have.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t get it how Americans are so easy to sway to useless war.</p>

<p>Its time to grow up and get real here,  stop the propaganda crap.   At least Russia has to admit it was full of shit in its Soviet days.    The US is still years away from admitting that its been full of shit and on a global murder spree based on lies and myths.</p>
