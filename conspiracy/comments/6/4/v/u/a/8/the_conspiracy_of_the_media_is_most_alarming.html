<p>What war? Trump has told Fox he won&#39;t be going into Syria. This was a one off missile attack on an air-base which intelligence says was holding the chemicals that killed all those children.</p>

<p>Funny that you&#39;re telling us not to trust the MSM, and then immediately believe all their false hype about how we are heading to war in Syria. Where was the hype with the 26,000 bombs Obama dropped in Syria? There was none</p>

<p>Up until now, yes. North Korea, in and of itself, is irrelevant. The point is that the public is paying attention to this and not to what they <em>should</em> be paying attention to.

<p>Nothing. </p>

<p>The dollar is fiat, like all modern currency and is not backed by any tangible goods. It&#39;s value comes from our society <em>giving</em> it value based on faith in the US government. It says this on every dollar in your possession. </p>

<p>Where was the hype with the 26,000 bombs Obama dropped in Syria?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Obama was ostensibly bombing ISIS, and never &quot;officially&quot; bombed Syrian government targets. Trump has waded in with the first publicly declared deliberate bombing of Syrian state infrastructure since the start of the war in 2011. Big difference. Huge.</p>

<p>Wrong. Quite the contrary. He <em>is</em> listening. It is what he is being told that is the difference here. Trump <em>isn&#39;t</em> deciding anything. He is only <em>explaining</em> things to the public. </p>
