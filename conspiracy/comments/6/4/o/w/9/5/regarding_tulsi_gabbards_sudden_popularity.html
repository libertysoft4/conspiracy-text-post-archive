        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Yes, I like what this lady is saying. But we have been hoodwinked before.</p>

<p>She is extremely calm, well mannered, and talented and presentable on camera. TPTB could be GROOMING her as the new female &quot;Obama&quot; they are prepping for 2020, as a breath of fresh air from trump. She is saying things I like, but the body language, her CFR membership, her sudden and random thrust into the limelight, the fact that she is a palatable female democrat progressive; it all points to her being prepped for a 2020 run, and I keep hearing people call for it, so it&#39;s probably going to happen. </p>

<p>Wasn&#39;t there a redditor here who knows tulsi personally? Several have pointed to her membership in the CFR. If you&#39;re in the CFR, you&#39;re a puppet. It&#39;s that simple. They don&#39;t let people like Ron Paul or Rand Paul in, and they wouldn&#39;t WANT them anyway! And don&#39;t give me that &quot;well, she&#39;s the best we got!&quot;, that&#39;s how the plebs talk about politicians, cherry picking the good things and ignoring the bad things with their mental gymnastics, just like all the autistic trump supporters have done/are doing... </p>

<p>Be skeptical people...this is a conspiracy sub. Fucks sake...lets nip this one in the bud for once before it takes flight. If she IS the next puppet, we could fuck up their whole agenda by exposing her early enough. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Man, me and a buddy were talking about her today. I told him something about her just don&#39;t sit right with me. She is highly attractive, she speaks well, she is speaking out against the Syrian war narrative. She isn&#39;t afraid to stir shit. She is intelligent. She is basically &quot;perfect&quot;. </p>

<p>That bugs me. They say he Anti-Christ will first appear to fix everything, and be loved by all. Not sayin she is the AC, just sayin...there is something fucky with her.</p>

<p>At first I was on the Gabbard hype train, then I started researching. CFR ruined it for me. Just far too many nefarious ties she has for me to trust her at all. </p>

<p>She&#39;s gonna run in 2020, I guarantee it. </p>

She&#39;s definitely not who we should be going after. These are the politicians we need more of, it genuinely looks like she&#39;s one of the good ones.

<p>you still think that&#39;s all it takes to make it &quot;clear&quot;? Honestly if you think things are immediately clear you should take a step back and think about just how many ways there are to deceive. I can&#39;t help but agree with some things she says but look at what a fraud Sanders turned out to be: went from talking about wall street oligarchs and the Mosaddegh coup to endorsing Clinton, the Cold War 2.0 narrative, and Syrian regime change</p>
