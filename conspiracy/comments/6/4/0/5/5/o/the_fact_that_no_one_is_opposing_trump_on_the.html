Look at the top threads on r/news and worldnews.  It is hard to find a negative comment in there.  There are some comments making fun of Trump, but not criticizing his decision.  This is what the deep state wanted, and, in my opinion, makes me think the gas attack was a false flag.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From the gas attack or from the missiles? What im saying is I think that the missile strike was due to happen regardless of the gas attack, it&#39;s just that the gas attack (regardless of who did it) gave him great cover for the missile strike. He gets praise from the MSM, and it pissed Russia off (supposedly) so a lot of non-Trump supporters are happy as well. </p>

<p>Regardless of whether he actually has Russian ties or not, it&#39;s hard to say he does if he&#39;s openly bombing Syrian Military locations.</p>

<p>&quot;Freeing the citizens of Libya?&quot; &quot;If you&#39;re a liberal you can&#39;t allow men like Assad to stay in power?&quot; </p>

<p>Sort of like how we liberated the Iraqi people (including 500,000 that we &quot;liberated&quot; from this earthly realm) and how we allow dictators like the ones running Saudi Arabia, Nigeria, Burundi, etc, to stay in power all the time? </p>

<p>Intuition tells me that Trump is another Zionist cocksucker that wants to enrich his friends and family regardless of the impact on the masses. </p>

<p>It tells me that it doesn&#39;t matter how many peasants die to achieve that so gassing a town or bombing some soldiers is no sweat off their backs.</p>

<p>It tells me that actual death is good for the plan because no one is alive to dispute the story.</p>

<p>It tells me that legacy media is an asset that wants to show results, bodies are results to the masses because as civilized as we claim to be we are still by and large goddamn animals.</p>

<p>I totally disagree. Obama&#39;s presidency was marked by a avoidance of &quot;boots on the ground&quot; operations, which earned him the ire of interventionists who wanted regular US ground forces Iraq against ISIS. Hillary and Obama had distinctive disagreements on foreign policy -- they were not one and the same.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It was a totally unnecessary act. Trump would have gained respect, in fact, if he would have coolly assessed the situation instead of trying to go for an &quot;easy win&quot; by using military might. It&#39;s all a clumsy and transparent way to win public approval via wagging the dog. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a fair point, especially your first one. Obama did love his drones. The boots on the ground thing was more of a thing for republicans and Clinton. I&#39;d still maintain that both him and Clinton&#39;s main mission in Syria was to get rid of Assad and install a US puppet instead. How to get to that eventual regime change was a matter of dispute as you point out, but the desired end goal (at least to my mind) was identical.</p>

<p>On your second point, I slightly disagree. On its face, any act of aggression or violence is an unnecessary act (except in direct defense of the innocent), but I can see at least some sense in this one. </p>

<p>I disagree that he would have come out on top had he simply condemned the use of chemical weapons but not reacted militarily at all, or as some wish he did, had he announced that he believes (as I think he actually believes) that Assad wasn&#39;t really behind the chemical attacks. In either of those cases he would have either been branded as a Russian puppet even more relentlessly, or as a weak president who talks big but acts small, or both. </p>

<p>The path he did end up choosing looks good on the news who already pushed the narrative that Assad was to blame without evidence to back up the claim, signals strength to potential foes abroad and neuters any further push for an all-out war since he already produced an arguably appropriate response. But again, I may well be wrong.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What scares me is that if I even for a second propose that the attacks were manufactured - everyone I know calls me a heartless sociopath and an Alex Jones follower. Nutcase fringe shitheads like him have made it so that doubting the official story means you&#39;re an immoral person.</p>

<p>I mean, look at what happens:</p>

<ul>
<li>Trump is in the middle of a Russia probe inquiry where all of his advisers are quiting or being dismissed.</li>
<li>Bannon gets dismissed from the security council</li>
<li>Days later, while things in Syria are stabilizing towards Assad, this attack happens</li>
<li>Trump does a 180 on his position of Syria and starts bombing</li>
<li>Russia repeals the law which prevents direct armed conflict with the US</li>
</ul>

<p>Seriously? Is this a fucking Tom Clancy novel? Could this be any more straightforward?</p>

<p>Granted, I hate Trump. He&#39;s bourgeois scum of the worst variety and he campaigned on a bed of lies, promising to &#39;save&#39; the working man. Despite that, he did oppose War in Syria and was smart enough to take council from Tulsi Gabbard.</p>

<p>So I think in light of the recent events, he&#39;s probably been &#39;compromised.&#39; As in the CIA now has more leverage over him than the Russians do. </p>

<p>Or he&#39;s just playing deeper into the script that the Russians want, which is some sort of direct conflict where the US makes intentional mistakes in several global theaters all at once, thus making America look both weak and bloodthirsty at the same time, so the EU will start buying oil from Russia/Iran/Syria instead.</p>

<p>I expect sometime in the next few weeks we&#39;ll see an escalation in the South China Sea, maybe DPRK. The long term strategy is probably for the US to invade Iran itself. Once we&#39;re boggled in multiple places at once, Russia will make some moves to reclaim several of the former S.R.&#39;s </p>

<p>This whole thing is just brutally stupid.</p>

<p>Trump&#39;s one advantage over Hillary for a lot of people was his supposedly noninterventionist stance, and now he doesn&#39;t even have that. Otherwise, he has been shown to be a marginal, if not outright incompetent, domestic leader, which is why his polling numbers have plummeted. </p>

They were never left wingers. (Except a rare exceptional few like Bernie.)
They&#39;re nearly all right wingers pretending to be left wing (called NEOliberals).
Republicans pretend to be moderate right wingers but are actually extremely
right wing and authoritarian (called NEOconservatives).</p>

<p>People often just call them both NEOcons because they&#39;re so similar and both suck.
Voting is not a scam, but the two party rigged system IS a scam.
Independent is the only way to go.
Although not all Independents are trustworthy.
Dr. Jill Stein is trustworthy but Gary Johnson is a Koch brothers shill
who is pro-TPP and far right economically.

<p>The emotionally controlled (democrats and dumber republicans) are &quot;OMG THINK OF THE CHILDREN!&quot; and therefore support him.</p>

<p>The smarties are freaking out because it looks to them like he fell for an obvious false flag.</p>

<p>Trump is 150+ IQ, literally a genius.    He&#39;s thinking several steps ahead.   He understands that this is a win for him that sets up more wins.</p>

<ul>
<li>Muh Russia people, were cringe before with their desperation to push that retarded narrative.  They look even more moronic now.</li>
<li>He looks strong to Korea, Russia, China, etc.   Putting himself in a good position.  They know if he makes a threat it&#39;s the real deal.</li>
<li>He&#39;ll kill people in a second if necessary.  The question of whether he&#39;d so this is now answered.</li>
<li>He &quot;did something&quot;  he issue is now put to bed.   No boots on the ground are needed.</li>
<li>By warning Russia before the strike WW3 was never really possible.</li>
</ul>

<p>The drawback of looking like a fool for falling for the obvious false flag will be easy to spin.   IF it ever comes out he can blame the military, then usher in a new era of working WITH Assad/Putin and no one can blame him or say &quot;Muh Russia.&quot;   If it never comes out, then Assad lost a few planes.   Not a crippling blow, Russia will just send him 20 more.</p>

<p>If he now goes full retard and throws us into a hot war to remove Assad I&#39;ll eat crow, but his move was the right one.   Not only did he play his opponents for fools (again) but he&#39;s exposed his more flighty supporters while solving several political problems.</p>

Turns out it was US supported moderate Syrian terroris...I mean rebels who used sarin gas.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;<strong>...In fact, even before Assad’s forces gained the momentum, a UN official reportedly found evidence of rebels using chemical weapons but no evidence Assad’s regime did. This, from a Washington Times article by Shaun Waterman dated May 6, 2013:</strong></p>

<p>&quot;<strong>Testimony from victims strongly suggests it was the rebels, not the Syrian government, that used Sarin nerve gas during a recent incident in the revolution-wracked nation, a senior U.N. diplomat said Monday.</strong></p>

<p>Carla del Ponte, a member of the U.N. Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Syria, told Swiss TV there were “strong, concrete suspicions but not yet incontrovertible proof,” that rebels seeking to oust Syrian strongman Bashar al-Assad had used the nerve agent.</p>

<p>But she said her panel had not yet seen any evidence of Syrian government forces using chemical weapons, according to the BBC, but she added that more investigation was needed. {emphasis ours}</p>

No individuals were harmed only property and aircraft were. Also, with the timing of the meeting between trump and China&#39;s leader, its plain tobsee that this was a strategic move to show that this orange dope isnt ducking around. Thirdly, him bombing assads airfeild appeases his opposition, while also further debunking the whole Russia hacked the election nonsense.

<p>Both Clinton and Obama were aiming for a boots-on-the-ground, Iraq- or Afghanistan-style kind of operation,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I totally disagree. Obama&#39;s presidency was marked by a avoidance of &quot;boots on the ground&quot; operations, which earned him the ire of interventionists who wanted regular US ground forces Iraq against ISIS. Hillary and Obama had distinctive disagreements on foreign policy -- they were not one and the same.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I still wish none of that juvenile bluster was necessary, but for an act of war, it could have been much, much worse.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It was a totally unnecessary act. Trump would have gained respect, in fact, if he would have coolly assessed the situation instead of trying to go for an &quot;easy win&quot; by using military might. It&#39;s all a clumsy and transparent way to win public approval via wagging the dog. </p>

<p>What I am referring to by &quot;replacement of western populations&quot; is the decline in first-world birthrates to below replacement level coinciding with the population explosion of the third world, while we pay extortionate taxes to feed starving third-worlders, and to feed, house, and relocate the immigrants who are destroying our societies from within.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The US is already homogenized and has been since WW2. You were born far after national identity ruled over this country. States may still maintain some level of nationalism, but not the country as a whole.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s fair enough, and it&#39;s a more valid point for European nations anyway. US culture is becoming dominant around the world, there&#39;s not really any chance of its replacement, but to clarify what I mean, I am explicitly against the sort of cultural imperialism that has made the rest of the world act so much more American in the last century.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m not sure where you even conjectured this idea from, it sounds like you&#39;ve been a victim of propaganda. Accepting people from other countries does not give them free reign to violate established customs and laws.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In a democratic society, that&#39;s exactly what it does. Letting in outsiders, failing to assimilate them, and letting them vote on the direction of the country does exactly that.</p>

<p>It was a &quot;rule through fear&quot; attack by Assad.  He seems to have believed that the only way to peace was to make people too afraid of him to continue rebelling.  In service to that objective, he used a period of rare international support to try to get away by sheer chutzpah with a boneheaded chemical attack.</p>
