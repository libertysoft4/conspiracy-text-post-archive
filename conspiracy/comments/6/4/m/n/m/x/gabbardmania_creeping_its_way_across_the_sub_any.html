<p><a href="https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/sociopolitica/sociopol_globalelite24.htm">CFR Bilderberg Group Trilateral Commision  - Global Control</a></p>

<p><a href="https://thezog.wordpress.com/who-controls-the-council-on-foreign-relations-part-1/">Who controls the CFR?</a></p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The reason that presidential candidates’ promises of “change” go largely unfulfilled once in office: they draw their top personnel from the same establishment groups — of which the Trilateral Commission is only one.</p>

<p>Chief among these groups is the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), the most visible manifestation of what some have called the American establishment. Members of the council have dominated the administrations of every president since Franklin D. Roosevelt, at the cabinet and sub-cabinet level. It does not matter whether the president is a Democrat or Republican. </p>

<p>Power Behind the Throne</p>

<p>In theory, America’s government is supposed to be “of the people, by the people, for the people.” While this concept rang true in early America, and many individuals still trust in it, the last century has seen the reality of power increasingly shift from the people to an establishment rooted in banking, Wall Street, and powerful multinational corporations. Syndicated columnist Edith Kermit Roosevelt, granddaughter of Teddy Roosevelt, explained:</p>

<p>The word “Establishment” is a general term for the power elite in international finance, business, the professions and government, largely from the northeast, who wield most of the power regardless of who is in the White House. Most people are unaware of the existence of this “legitimate Mafia.” </p>

<p>Yet the power of the Establishment makes itself felt from the professor who seeks a foundation grant, to the candidate for a cabinet post or State Department job. It affects the nation’s policies in almost every area.</p>

<p>Roosevelt added that this group’s goal is “a One World Socialist state governed by ‘experts’ like themselves.”</p>

<p>David Rockefeller, the longtime chairman (and now chairman emeritus) of the CFR, acknowledged the role of the establishment in trying to lead America in the one-world direction in his 2002 book Memoirs:</p>

<p>For more than a century ideological extremists at either end of the political spectrum have seized upon well-publicized incidents such as my encounter with Castro to attack the Rockefeller family for the inordinate influence they claim we wield over American political and economic institutions. <strong>Some even believe we are part of a secret cabal working against the best interests of the United States, characterizing my family and me as “internationalists” and of conspiring with others around the world to build a more integrated global political and economic structure — one world, if you will. If that’s the charge, I stand guilty, and I am proud of it.</strong></p>

We all know she&#39;s way different than Bush, Clinton, and Obama, since she&#39;s near-woke and opposes foreign intervention.

<p>Founding members of the CFR include J.P. Morgan, John D. Rockefeller, Paul Warburg, Colonel House, Jacob Shciff and Otto Kahn. These also happened to be the gentleman who created the Federal Reserve.</p>

<p>The CFR is a problem because it&#39;s a non elected Cabal think tank that generates policies for the benefit of the elite who created it. </p>

<p>Are you content to not demand more? Is that how cynical we&#39;ve become. Accepting the status quo because you don&#39;t expect better, means you&#39;ll forever receive the status quo. There is no reason for a decent politician, with genuine intent to be part of the CFR. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I basically said the same thing over at T_D today when some idiot was telling us to give a big thanks to Mitch McConnell... These people, I just don&#39;t get them. The words they say do not match their actions. The voting record of 99% of our politicians is horrible and they do not represent the American people. Gabbard is no different. She has voted party lines on plenty of issues but suddenly after she starts angling for a 2020 run she starts breaking rank and pushing bills that get tons of positive press from places like CNN.</p>

<p>They are obviously pushing her to be the frontrunner in 2020 because they know they cannot win with another apparent globalist. Instead they will use one that talks big and is still a member of CFR. The people need to wake the hell up.</p>

<p>Exactly. During the election I saw people say Clinton is a pedophile for visiting but Trump isn&#39;t &quot;because it was only a couple of times&quot;. </p>

<p>In another conversation, more recently perhaps, that same individual will say the Rockerfellers &amp; Rothschilds exercise undue influence on world affairs, but &quot;Tulsi Gabbard being a member of their flagship organisation for global control isn&#39;t that big a deal really &quot;</p>

<p>Sure she seems the real deal now, but so did Obama. All the things she&#39;s saying sound great, but are mostly insignificant at this stage in Trumps presidency. The best she can do over the next 3 years is increase her profile further by being the people&#39;s champion against Trump. 
If she ends up running against Trump, what are the odds she wins? Good I&#39;d wager. I&#39;d take those. Let&#39;s sa she does, what then? She just tells the CFR: peace! I&#39;m good from here. Don&#39;t worry about filling my cabinet with members like <em>the last 6 administrations</em> And goes on to do all the great stuff she was preaching?? Just like Obama di- oh.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Litmus test: if you run as a Dem or Repub, you can&#39;t be trusted after seeing what happened to Bernie (RIGGED PRIMARIES).
In Trump&#39;s case, I never believed he was anti-establishment, (maybe partially, at best)....
But if we assume Trump intended to be at least partially anti-establishment,
did the deep state military industrial complex screw him over or the GOP?
Of course he could have been controlled opposition from the start (maybe not decades in the making, but perhaps one decade in the making....)</p>

<p>Either way, a third party candidate with good pro-working/middle class policies, with the right amount of security and support of the public, we can&#39;t fail.</p>

<p>But it would dramatically help us if campaign finance reform happened to level the playing field.
As well as having anti-establishment news channels to drain views
away from the corporate media and wake more people up.
But how would we get an anti-establishment channel on TV?
People still watch TV....even though it&#39;s kind of dying thanks to the internet.</p>

<p>A Bernie/Stein ticket would be great.
Bernie&#39;s name recognition coupled with Jill&#39;s lack of involvement with the two party system
would be a force to be reckoned with. (Or if Bernie is not comfortable being so heavily involved,
he could just be part of the campaign for a while to give Jill some visibility and then depart
and allow Jill to continue the peaceful political revolution).</p>

<p>But if it&#39;s part of the two party system, it&#39;s going to fail.
If the person is legit (Bernie is at least mostly legit, Jill probably even more so)
then they&#39;d get rigged, no doubt.
If the person is controlled opposition, it will be just the same BS over and over again.</p>

<p>If we had great conditions, a genuine non-puppet candidate with great security and publicity,
the only other barriers would be ensuring the general election doesn&#39;t get rigged.
We also don&#39;t have a true democracy.
Not even in the basic sense of 1 person = 1 vote.
Let alone in the sense of being truly informed.
In a manipulated society, democracy doesn&#39;t exist,
because the brainwashing is just a less invasive form of mind control.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No hate involved, just noting troubling associations. This is a conspiracy sub - when did we start fawning over politicians because they started saying things we liked? Erm, well. <em>Every single time</em> it appears. </p>

<p>Give me something here- is there nothing suspicious at all with the way she&#39;s emerged from the election as the only democrat with any credibility, resigned as DNC chair to support Bernie, loved by republicans for giving Trump a chance, <em>later going onto meet</em> Trump amidst talks shes being tapped up for SOS, all the whilst giving the departing Obama cabinet hell for conducting an illegal war in Syria.</p>

<p>But there&#39;s more!</p>

<p>Gabbard somehow has the juice to undermine the entire narrative by travelling to Syria to expose the lie that provided cover for supporting Terrorists: <em>moderate rebels.</em></p>

<p>A 36 year old congresswoman. Risks her career inducing the ire of the Democratic Party Machine  by resigning as DNC chair to support Bernie. When you consider Trump wasn&#39;t widely expected to win, Gabbard pulled off a Master stroke. </p>

<p>Any other move would have sent her career decisively in the other direction : </p>

<blockquote>
<p>stay &amp; endorse Hillary - denounce Trump- Trump wins and <em>ziip!</em> off goes her credibility like the rest of DNC. Plus she loses any love to be gained with Trump supporters </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Instead, she&#39;s adored by all, suspected by none, and off to the White House she goes...</p>

<p>I doubt it. You&#39;d probably have a corresponding event to produce:</p>

<p>&quot;Aha! See - that was during Gabbards anti war protest march- the DNC &amp; their donors are working hard&quot;</p>

<p>How exactly do you manage to maintain that position knowing as you do she voluntarily chose to join the same company as <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=KP1OAD9jSaI">people like this lady.</a> </p>

<p>The wars that rather odious lady is discussing came about through policies enacted by herself, and the rest of the Bush Cabinet- Rice, Cheney, Powell- all CFR.</p>

<p>I wonder what new faces will be in Gabbards? What policies we can look forward to?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I basically said the same thing over at T_D today when some idiot was telling us to give a big thanks to Mitch McConnell... These people, I just don&#39;t get them. The words they say do not match their actions. The voting record of 99% of our politicians is horrible and they do not represent the American people. Gabbard is no different. She has voted party lines on plenty of issues but suddenly after she starts angling for a 2020 run she starts breaking rank and pushing bills that get tons of positive press from places like CNN.</p>

<p>They are obviously pushing her to be the frontrunner in 2020 because they know they cannot win with another apparent globalist. Instead they will use one that talks big and is still a member of CFR. The people need to wake the hell up.</p>
