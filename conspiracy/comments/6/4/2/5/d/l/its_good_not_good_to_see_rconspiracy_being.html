    <div class="md"><p>That would explain an emotional reaction to obscure headline-only news.  For what its worth, I&#39;ll tell you this is a warning shot and flex to the World not to conduct actions like this and think they will get Obama-era &quot;wah wah&quot; talks at the UN and a complete lack of action / reciprocation.  Trust me, nobody wants war with the US.  But world leadership needs to stop seeing the US as timid and conflict-avoidant tamed by hopeless UN diplomacy.</p>

<p>I could go on and on about not biting the false flag hook of rebels dropping the gas from the air.  Rebels don&#39;t have an airforce.  Hundreds of eye witnesses report it was dropped from the air.  The airstrip that launched the attack was leveled without loss of life.  Russia was warned prior to the attack.  Russia warned Assad, who informed personnel to keep clear of the impending attack area.</p>

<p>Yes, this is part of one side of the discussion.  All I&#39;m saying is that there is ample evidence on both sides to warrant suspending judgement.  We, the public, simply do not know the facts.  So wait for them to come out before setting your hair on fire.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The leadership is certainly more privy to the facts and intelligence that the public is.  I like to believe that every President (and decision maker everywhere) does what they deem is best (all things considered) with the information they are provided (which is, in the President&#39;s case, far more complete that what we see).  Think &quot;the lesser of two evils.&quot;  I believe him to be a sound decision maker, but with a media war waged on him, he doesn&#39;t explain much, but instead allows the media to dig up their own facts.  The facts have put out just about every fire that the media has started.  All we do now is wait for them to trickle in.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not a bad post. But when the dust settles who is going to tell a story based on truth instead of the propaganda they get paid to print. New media is great but you can find any slant taking liberty with the facts on every issue. When Assange and Snowden are not facing prison or death in the US I will listen to the Government. Until then I have to assume they know they are guilty and they do not care what the people think or want.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>THIS!  Much obliged to hear reason here instead of the common over-emotional reaction.  In regard to Assange &amp; Snowden, I&#39;m right there with you but there are political sides to that as well.  Inviting Snowden back in with open arms would set a precedent to the Intelligence community that could be pretty damaging and without a fix.  Best action there is to remain hands-off.  Charge them and not act on extradition or prosecution.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fellow Libertarian - don&#39;t go too far, Mate!  You will be back when the Fed/IRS get audited.  Strategic attacks and show of force like this avoids greater conflicts and allows diplomacy in the future.  If every World government knows you won&#39;t act, they will continue to walk all over you, knowing diplomacy and the UN tames you.  I bet North Korea calms down now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thats quite a conclusion to jump to.  I don&#39;t support regime change; hell, I don&#39;t even know the fine details of the entirely complex situation that Syria is.  Not sure anyone could honestly make a claim to...  For the fourth time now, I am just hoping/inviting everyone to suspend judgment until real news and facts come in.  Maybe my message had confrontational wording but it was intended as a response to seeing insane conclusions being jumped to on this sub.</p>
