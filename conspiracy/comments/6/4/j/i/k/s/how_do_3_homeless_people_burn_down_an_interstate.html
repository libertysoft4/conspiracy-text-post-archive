<p>Not to underestimate the homeless but something tells me you can&#39;t just toss a Molotov cocktail, or light a bonfire at/under the I-85 bridge and get it to do this </p>

<p><a href="http://m.journaltimes.com/news/national/ga-i--fire-and-bridge-collapse/html_fdf6b004-ee69-5df4-83f2-88c76a80d189.html">http://m.journaltimes.com/news/national/ga-i--fire-and-bridge-collapse/html_fdf6b004-ee69-5df4-83f2-88c76a80d189.html</a></p>

<p>I mean that&#39;s a serious fire and something has to be fuelling it. I&#39;m not a bridge materials expert but I&#39;m fairly certain that a bridge isn&#39;t going to have many flammable materials in its make up. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you would have read the CNN article, you would have seen that the area below the interstate was a storage area, mostly HDPE pipes. </p>

<p>HDPE isn&#39;t extremely flamable or anything, and would have needed a good catalyst, but once it got going it would have burned at a very good temperature with a lot of fuel.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I did read the article and did look into HDPE and I really don&#39;t think that would be enough to make a fire like that. Like you said it&#39;s a slow burning material and it&#39;s not really known for its volatility </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It certainly would be. The ignition source is the interesting part, to me. Especially if it was stored outdoors (it was) and exposed to sunlight (yes), it may have had some UV deterioration that would have made it more vulnerable. Plus, the shapes of pipes would mean excellent airflow, which would be perfect for sustaining a fire once it started. </p>

<p>It really doesn&#39;t look that volatile to me man, I guess if you had a big pile of it you might get a decent smouldering mess but that fire under that bridge was raging, there had to be a good amount of some kind of fuel added on </p>

<p>i wasn&#39;t there, i don&#39;t know, but to my ears a bunch of idiots crack piping and setting ablaze a ton of neglected construction material is way more plausible than an ISIS attack on american soil, against a low profile target, without any bragging after the fact, and a complete media black out...  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>From what I read the county was storing unused materials under the bridge. All supposed non-combustibles including PVC piping and fiber optic cables. Why these valuable supplies would be forgotten under the bridge is beyond me. Some claim a lot of diesel fuel was stolen in the days before the fire. A diesel fuel fire would look very similar to what we saw in the videos. Most suspicious to me is how fast this was cleaned up. I understand how critical this infrastructure is to the daily commute of hundreds of thousands, but you don&#39;t see the government work so quickly often. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I&#39;m not trying to claim it was a terrorist attack I&#39;m just not sold on the idea that 3 homeless people can light some HDPE on fire and cause that intense of a blaze</p>

<p><a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=HmM0xLX_4mY">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=HmM0xLX_4mY</a></p>

<p>In that video you can see that HDPE is flammable but it&#39;s not going to burn like the fire under the bridge did without added fuel </p>

<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstate_85_bridge_collapse">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstate_85_bridge_collapse</a></p>

<p>The fire was started around 6:15 PM and was hot enough and intense enough after just 45 minutes to bring down the bridge at 7 PM. By 8 PM they have the fire under control. </p>

<p>But in the video of the burning HDPE we can see that after 20 minutes the HDPE is burning but already half gone </p>

<p>They also say it was maliciously set so that&#39;s why I want to know <em>how</em> they did. There was almost certainly added elements to fuel the fire </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What&#39;s sort of puzzling is how it fell in one piece which ment the connection points would&#39;ve probably had to been exposed to direct heat and flame. 4 corners got the precise amount of heat to cause collapse? Even one or two connection points failed wouldn&#39;t the collapse been irregular instead of a clean break?  Keep in mind many roads, bridges, overpasses have expansion joints for changes in temperature but still.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Regardless of WHO started the fire, the real questions seem to be:</p>

<p>1) Why was that material sitting under the bridge for 5 YEARS without being moved? Did Georgia&#39;s DOT have any idea that it was there? 
2) Who allowed it to be put under the bridge in the first place and why was it never moved? 
3) How the FUCK did they find the guy who did it so quick and how did they determine in such a short amount of time that it was set by a sofa and a grocery cart, when the fire was clearly hot enough to bring down a bridge?.... Or if it was a &quot;crack pipe&quot; was that just based on what the homeless guy told them?.... </p>

<p>It seems like the fire would have incinerated all evidence of exactly how it actually started... The rush to arrest and cover the narrative is what&#39;s most curious about the fire... Something is definitely fishy here and I don&#39;t really think it was ISIS, but there&#39;s absolutely a side of this story that we&#39;re not getting the truth on. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m from here. I&#39;m not sold on an ISIS attack unless there is a major offensive on U.S. soil and we have to evacuate(i85 north and south are closed should be open in 10 weeks). There is a lot of stuff going on in Atlanta. We have a contractor that rolled on everyone he was bribing to get contracts(court hearings are started. Soon?) 2 new sports stadiums getting built( Braves stadium is pretty controversial). They are making deals and when it goes public they instantly revise them. Falcon stadium is having roof problems may not make the deadline. It could be a money grab for federal money. The story doesn&#39;t add up but with the reporting that we are used to, details don&#39;t matter just the headline does. Headlines turn  into facts. They may be a little more controversy going on in the metroATL but I don&#39;t know off the top of my head.</p>
