    <div class="md"><p>I just love the knee-jerk reaction of calling &#39;conspiracy&#39; every time someone&#39;s front page doesn&#39;t look the way <em>they</em> think it should.  Just because you can&#39;t see it on <em>your</em> front page any longer doesn&#39;t mean reddit censored the article.  My front page has two articles linking to the video, two more articles with separate discussions about overbooking, plus this post... and all of those articles are hours older than your post.  If there was such a conspiracy to remove the discussion about the airline, don&#39;t you think ALL of the articles would have been squashed?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah same, but something about rules and free speech in general gets a few people angry then all of a sudden all of reddit is up in arms about their rights. </p>

<p>So I&#39;m not objectifying an opinion, just soaking in and analyzing what&#39;s happening today, and this video from United Airlines is pretty interesting. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t all we know is police were asked to escort him off? Is there not much more of a story line? Or an interview from the man himself? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We&#39;re in the same boat. It&#39;s strange to me that lots of reddit calls for &quot;conspiracy!&quot; from the get go, even though it clearly does violate the subs rules. I know as a mod myself (in a far less popular sub), sometimes you remove the highest upvoted things because they don&#39;t fit the sub or go against the rules. So I&#39;m confused a lot by that point being made in how it&#39;s a conspiracy. </p>

<p>But, from what I can gather, is that this man was beat up because of United&#39;s fuckup of overbooking. United asked people to volunteer, nobody did, so they had a computer &quot;select&quot; who to take off. This man was the 3rd of 4, and didn&#39;t go so easily. So they kicked his ass and dragged him off the plane. He somehow got back on, received medical attention on the plane, and the plane went back into the gate to &quot;tidy up&quot;. </p>

<p>We&#39;re in the same boat as far as I can tell, I have no clue what really happened. But all this &quot;censorship censorship!&quot; hoopla seems somewhat misguided at this point, especially if it was removed for breaking a sub rule. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Most of them are just normal dudes that think just like you do.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And this is the problem. Most PEOPLE are just normal dudes, but for some reason people think that cops are completely infalliable, and that people are all criminals. The police think that all citizens are criminals and the company is in the right. </p>

<p>A company calls the police to have someone thrown off of a plane. Then this happens. Doesn&#39;t matter that he paid to be there. Doesn&#39;t matter that he was already seated on the plane. They were either overweight or they had a higher paying customer who needed his seat. Either way, he is not the problem. They called the police, they took the airline&#39;s side and forcefully ejected him from the plane. Everyone else was visibly upset, yet the police just couldn&#39;t see past their preconceived notion that the airline was right and he was wrong. And no one else was willing to stand up for this man because they were afraid of being wrongly singled out and forced off the plane at the hands of a police officer serving their master.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh I completely agree. They even let him back on the plane after the fact, to me that shows they know they screwed up. </p>

<p>The people they picked are likely due to the fact that their ticket price is the cheapest. Meaning the compensation they are required to compensate for. </p>

<p>If the passenger will arrive between one and two hours later than planned — or between one and four hours for an international flight — the airline must pay the passenger twice the amount of the one-way fare to his destination, up to $675.</p>

<p>If the passenger will be delayed more than two hours — or four hours for international flights — the airline must pay him four times the one-way fare, up to $1,350.</p>

<p>The time to bump someone from a flight is not after they have been seated on the plane, but before they board. Keeping in mind in 2016 United bumped between 40,000 and 63,000 passengers off flights due to overselling. Across all airlines that number is closer to 434,000. These numbers also do not always include volunteers. </p>

<p>As a reference where I got this information on bumped flights see the link below.

<p>Interesting things to note here is that he was &quot;involuntarily bumped&quot; which usually only occurs before boarding. The Airline might have been out of luck here seeing as the plane was already boarded. He was apparently bumped to make room for United Airlines crew. He <em>got back on to the plane</em> 10 minutes later with a bloody face and apparently said &quot;I need to go home&quot; </p>

<p>It&#39;s ridiculous that that&#39;s literally what they teach kids now. Just submit, and take the cop to court and (hope) that you might win.

<p>I was waiting for my wife to leave a doctor&#39;s appt. at the hospital a few months ago when there was a car crash in the parking lot.  I turned to see what happened, and all I saw was a crowd gathering, with phones aplenty pointed at the two cars.</p>

<p>I walked over and simply asked the drivers if they needed medical help.  Sure they were both agitated and hard to understand, but luckily only their prides were hurt.  Once I made sure they were ok, I excused myself from the situation.</p>

Airplanes aren&#39;t Government Welfare, they&#39;re privately owned businesses and can do what they want with their seats.  </p>

<p>They offered more than fair compensation and when there weren&#39;t any takers, went to another &#39;fair&#39; method, randomly removing 4 passengers. </p>

<p>Whether or not they made the mistake of overbooking is irrelevant, it&#39;s their airplane and their policy.  The doctor should be pissed but walked off once the Air Marshall&#39;s got involved.  It&#39;s pretty simple logic.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s not &quot;his&quot; seat, they made a trade for that seat in return for money and he signed knowing they had the power to remove him if necessary.  That&#39;s all part of the &quot;trade&quot;.  He took it way to far, to the point of being physically removed.

<p>&quot;Fair compensation&quot; is whatever I decide the seat <em>I&#39;ve already paid for</em> is worth to me. Too fucking bad that other employees were going to have to work extra hours because the <em>airline didn&#39;t do it&#39;s job</em>.

<p>Well, they could have just refunded your money and told you to fuck off.  Just because you paid for a flight doesn&#39;t mean you own that physical seat and can do whatever you want.  </p>

<p>You&#39;re really going all out in your defense for United, but this statement makes it clear you have no idea what you&#39;re talking about. Instead of flooding this thread with comments defending United, maybe you should&#39;ve taken the time to educate yourself about <a href="https://www.transportation.gov/airconsumer/fly-rights">passenger rights</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If the airline arranges substitute transportation that is scheduled to arrive at your destination between one and two hours after your original arrival time (between one and four hours on international flights), the airline must pay you an amount equal to 200% of your one-way fare to your final destination that day, with a $675 maximum.</p>

<p>If the substitute transportation is scheduled to get you to your destination more than two hours later (four hours internationally), or if the airline does not make any substitute travel arrangements for you, the compensation doubles (400% of your one-way fare, $1350 maximum)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The only situation in which a passenger isn&#39;t entitled to compensation is when they are put on another flight which arrives within 1 hour of the original. </p>

<p>No my argument, my argument is that the doctor acted poorly.  He legally had to give up his seat once he was chosen, go ahead and be pissed but don&#39;t say on the plane, screaming like a child to the point you need to be physically removed.  </p>

<p>From the video I&#39;ve seen, you have that backwards: he doesn&#39;t start screaming until <em>after</em> the air marshals start to remove him. Admittedly the screaming seems a bit over the top, but the marshals aren&#39;t exactly gentle, as evidenced by the man&#39;s busted lip, fucked up glasses, and the passenger who comments &quot;No, this is wrong, oh my god, look at what you did to him&quot;</p>

<p>Of course it&#39;s entirely possible that the video is missing some context, and he was also screaming before he was removed. But the fact that the other passengers sounded legitimately distressed and concerned over what happened to the guy makes me think this is not the case.</p>

<p>But if you have a video or any other evidence of this guy acting up <em>before</em> his removal, please post a link. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>• Federal preemption. Many passengers don’t realize their basic right to seek redress through state and local courts doesn’t apply against airlines due to federal preemption; only U.S. courts oversee airlines.

<p>The airline needed to keep raising the reimbursement price for giving up a seat until people took it. You don&#39;t FORCE people off the plane. </p>

<p>Not saying that at all... they at least made an attempt.  It was perfectly in their rights to just refund them their money and kick them off.  Instead, they &quot;tried&quot; to make it right buy offering a refund, $800, and a hotel room.  Life isn&#39;t perfect but I don&#39;t want to live in a world where a person gets whatever they want, even when that thing isn&#39;t theirs.  </p>

<p>What makes us act (sometimes) is the threat of a lawsuit and while we are a bigger company, we dont have the money to defend ourselves everytime we would refuse to take down a video.</p>

<p>So Im willing to bet what happened is this: Video goes up. Airline company sees it and sends take down notice. Reddit says its allowed. Airline company says take it down or we will sue you since we cant ID the user as you are allowing the content. Reddit says &quot;I dont have enough money to fight this long term and win, and all for what? So one user can keep a video up that can be found anywhere right now? We&#39;ll just take it down&quot;.</p>

You posted this when there was already 2 posts of the same event, each with substantial amount of comments. I removed yours because it&#39;s the same event and didn&#39;t have any discussion going on. There were a bunch of posts from different sources covering the same event.</p>
