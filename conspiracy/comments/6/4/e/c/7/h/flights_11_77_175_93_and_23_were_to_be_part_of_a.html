    <div class="md"><p>Their funding switched from the soviet union (didn&#39;t exist anymore and was trending capitalist) to leftist billionaires like George Soros and others.  The soviets were in a position to facilitate 9/11/01, from within, they infiltrated the west in the early 80s via operation RYN.  Never been disputed by the CIA.  Pilotless aircraft technology may have played a part in trying to ensure that the plane portion of 9/11/01 live-drill went as planned, (landing at the airport), for instance, if the hijackers were not actors, which they weren&#39;t, but something went wrong with that fail-safe.  Maybe that technology wasn&#39;t as trustworthy as people thought.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s say that you knew the whole story but you didn&#39;t know whether the remote technology to land the planes at the airports was part of the story.  Would you not be satisfied?  The only people who could ever know if the remote tech was some sort of fail safe plan to land the planes safely or not are the people directly involved in what happened that day.  But if you could prove that it was a live drill designed to land the planes to get leverage to invade afghanistan that would be way more than the public accepts as truth right now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pick both, something that is classified can be discovered when moles are involved, people talk, people were involved in the drills on 9/11/01.  Your argument that if something is classified then 100% of the time no one can discover it, what I meant to say was &quot;the correct military contact&quot;, not any military contact.

<p>FBI sure is desperate to give themselves a good name in your theory.  I smell blood in the water.</p>
