        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Do people on this board think Sandy Hook was a hoax? I just finished watching the recently added Netflix documentary Newtown, which features many of the people that are accused of being &quot;crisis actors&quot; - and I have to say, they seem pretty real to me. </p>

<p>If anyone on this board thinks SH was a hoax, I have one main question that doesnt add up for me: where are these kids? Did they never exist? Are they living at home with their families but everyone in the community is remaining quiet? I would love to believe they are alive, but it just doesnt add up.</p>

<p>The hoax would mean that literally thousands of people conspired (and continue to) to keep this a secret. Is this one conspiracy this board doesnt believe in? Very open to hearing your thoughts.</p>

<p><strong>ETA 22hrs after original post (summary of what Ive learned)</strong></p>

<p>While there are oddities and uncanny resemblances, there is essentially no evidence this was a hoax. While many youtubers claim evidence, it&#39;s usually just a long winded ramble and mouse pointing to things that arent really evidence. Some examples include: </p>

<p>*a dashcam that didnt see kids leaving the school as per the official report. Explanation: the firehouse was behind this dashcam, and kids were led out away from this dashcam.</p>

<p>*2-3 parents have entertainment/acting backgrounds. Explanation: this isnt so weird out of 40 parents, that some of them have this background. Actually, it makes sense to me that the ones who have experience in front of cameras, are indeed the ones in front of the cameras. </p>

<p>*resemblance of one parent (wheeler) to an FBI agent. Explanation: ok these 2 men do look a lot alike, and while the FBI guy was really frumpy and handled the weapons totally unprofessionally, it&#39;s not enough evidence to prove a hoax.</p>

<p>*parent laughing before cameras turn on. Explanation: Grieving people act off all the time, and this is from my own personal experience, as well as the many proven instances of grief not affecting all people the same way. I wouldnt probably laugh ever again, but that&#39;s not a reason to think no one would. Plus he could have been on meds.</p>

<p>*no camera footage or photos. Explanation: I saved this for last bc it&#39;s the one with the most weight and least explanation. Yes, ofc I understand that you dont want your child&#39;s bloody photo on the internet, but at the same time, there are always leaks of this sort of evidence online. And 5 years out, we have no photos of lanza even. Why would we protect Lanza? Columbine shooters are out there, we&#39;ve seen all the carnage. Why would there be zero footage? This remains the main point that has no reasonable contention. </p>

<p>Thanks for mostly every commenter for being respectful, and engaging in a civil discourse. It&#39;s really the best. I got a lot of hate in PMs from both sides, but I appreciate the the public thread remained mostly authentic conversation. If you have to say something along the lines of : &quot;you have to be a total [moron/stupid/idiot/fool/sheep] to believe [xyz]...you&#39;ve greatly diminished your point of view, whatever side it falls on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How did all these people remain silent about the JFK assassination?  Or 9/11?  The NWO/Establishment has ways of silencing whistleblowers, and suppressing the reach of those who try to speak out.  </p>

<p>There are whistleblowers to the Sandy Hook hoax.  But they aren&#39;t given publicity in the Establishment media.  Reportedly, several former Connecticut State Police spoke out about it being a hoax.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you can share any links of that I&#39;d love to see it. </p>

<p>I have 2 kids. If all of a sudden I was claiming there were 3 and one of them was dead, there would just be so many people from intimate friends, to facebook friends that would say: yo, listen up this chick only ever had 2 kids we ever saw... it&#39;s really the part that makes it hard for me to accept that it&#39;s a hoax. </p>

<p>Because there are things that are strange about it...just that one thing doesnt add up.</p>

<p>I feel like JFK, and even 9/11  - whatever the truth may be, many, many less people were involved in the cover up.</p>

<p>Yea, all those funerals had empty caskets. No viewings. The funeral was a made for your viewing pleasure feature film like the rest.</p>

<p>Sort of baffles me why peope keep asking how &quot;so many people could keep this secret..&quot; ever heard of the US intelligence community. They keep big secrets every day. Big, Big, elaborate secrets. Sandy Hook is a tiny event in comparison to the much bigger things that have gone on for ages. Compartmentalisation. Only a few people need to know what&#39;s really going on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes but it&#39;s asking me to believe that literally thousands of unconnected people (not people who are connected as the Intelligence community) are keeping this a secret. Like, for example, my block has about 25 houses, both Dems and Reps on both sides of the street, so to come down and convince all 25 houses to pitch for the same team, would be, basically impossible. So how did they get citizens of Newtown to do this? There have to be pro-gun people living in newtown that WOULD NOT go along with this...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think they&#39;re saying that these &quot;families&quot; of the dead kids were moved into the town around the same time and integrated with the population.

    <div class="md"><p>OK, so it would follow (I think) that that means the other parents of 500 kids are also being duped...that it is only this handful of families that are the actors...which is more plausible than the entire town I guess...</p>

<p>Only a handful are keeping a fully informed secret. Newtown isn&#39;t a normal neighbourhood. The town itself and indeed the whole county of Fairfield has been a CIA training ground for decades. None of this would ever include informing an entire community, even if that community was entirely &quot;normal&quot;. It&#39;s not like the citizens would be present for the event or get to walk up on it. They&#39;d see it in the news like anyone else and that&#39;s it.</p>

<p>So if I was their neighbor, I know they never had a kid named Dylan - so why am I not saying so? Because I&#39;ve been paid to never mention that these people never had a son named Dylan?</p>

They neighbours are on film saying they didn&#39;t really know them but it&#39;s really sad. Think they just tricked everyone. Their kids through it was real, that stress being a parent and having that panic and seeing your child panicking is enough for them. The dead kids didn&#39;t exist in my opinion.

<p>If we take as a fact (and it is an &quot;if&quot; the size of Africa) that a shadowy cabal organised this school shooting for some purpose, it is inconceivable that they would concoct such a labyrinthine and complex plot that would never appear as realistic as actually just committing the attack for real. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. </p>

<p>The families of the &quot;victims&quot; were already actors, they made millions of dollars from charity, the AR-15 wielding attacker used a shotgun breaching round (you can&#39;t do that, if anyone isn&#39;t familiar with guns), there was a coverup that made it impossible to see records, and there is dash cam footage that is totally inconsistent with the narrative of the day.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a lot more to look into, but that&#39;s probably the big points.</p>

<p>I do find it amazing that there isnt a single picture of the violence.

<p>Sure, they could have. It&#39;s just really unlikely. </p>

<p>The closest thing to a smoking gun in the whole affair is the use of a breaching round. That, alone, almost demolishes the narrative. No shotgun was found at the scene, and the only shotgun was in his trunk away from the school, and showed no signs of being fired, nor did they find additional breaching rounds, IIRC.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Right, that&#39;s why I&#39;m pretty comfortable saying &quot;it didn&#39;t happen&quot; unlike other events that just look like something odd is going on. The Columbine kids may have been put up to the attack, but they definitely shot people.</p>

<p>If you were a Sandy Hook parent you would sue Alex Jones for millions of dollars for implying that it was fake, and be able to easily produce a mountain of evidence. That is a dead giveaway that nothing happened.</p>

<p>There are frangible shotgun rounds that are designed for busting a lock without risking damage to people on the other sign. Somebody used one at Sandy Hook, even though the shooter only had an AR15 (which shoots 5.56/.223 rifle rounds).</p>

<p>That&#39;s a funny video. He has 2 different rifles, no magazines for either, and like 8 pistol magazines.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The lack of any footage of the event has always bothered me. Our media will happily show &quot;sarin gassed&quot; children on national television but yet we cannot even see a dead soldier or any kind of victims of terrorist attacks in our own country! I am not extremely knowledgeable about sandy hook.</p>

<p>But Sloppy sniper and this other video of the kids and parents being interviewed and then literally walking around the camera man to go for a second go around always cast suspicion on the case. Plus making it illegal to question the authenticity while simultaneously sealing all records about the case, like death certificates, autopsy reports, and other important data like that is double suspicious.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually I cannot find the source of this claim so I might of been talking out of my ass. But a man was arrested for making 4 calls to Sandy Hook Elementary and asking about the incident. All he said was that it was a hoax and he was arrested for harrassment. Although they could not actually say what part of it was actually harassment. Many people have been arrested for questioning it, but I don&#39;t think it is actually illegal to do so. So I am sorry for being misleading.</p>

<p>Guys i have been following Sandy Hook since it happened, i remember the day like it was last week, i was so sad to hear about these kids deaths, tears were comming down my face
The more i watched the more things seemed out of place, i believe it was 100% staged, there is just more evidence pointing to it being fake than not.</p>

<p>I watched the live news broadcast all day and night, never were 500 plus kids shown evacuating the school, and if there were all those other kids, why have we not heard from other families, we just hear from the slain kids families.</p>

<p>Where the heck is Ryan Lanza and his dad after all these years?
Where are the friends and family to these people? 
Why was all the ambulances blocked in by cop cars and other vehicles?
WHY IN GODS GREEN EARTH DID THE POLICE BRING OUT SNACKS AND DRINKS AND SET THEM ON HIS HOOD IN THE SCHOOL PARKING LOT?
I have 2 kids that go to school and their school is super clean, WHY is there mold and water stains on the walls of the school?
Why did a lady&#39;s kid appear on the news as one of the slain kids when her kid was sitting right next to her? Then a day later they switched the kid when her mom wrote on facebook that her kid is alive and well and that this was freaking her out?</p>

<p>So your telling me that my kid goes to school, gets shot, and i never ever get to see the body again? They just hand back the clothes? Sure ok.</p>

<p>You guys the story of newtown is JACKED, i have not even mentioned all the mainstream oddities like in other posts, i do not want to believe that our government would do these acts but sadly ever since Kennedy and 9 11 i do not think we live in a truthful world, out of all of this you know who i feel sorry for? I feel sorry for US, the people who are being labled as consparicy idiots when all we want are these simple questions to be answered. After all, our kids are being raised under this government and it effects our daily lives, sadly i come to believe we are just pawns in a disgusting game of Chess.</p>

<p>Stay True to your hearts people, love your family and love your neighbor, we are all in this together, lets show our kids we have still have a backbone and values, cuz you think its bad now? Wait untill we leave our kids with all this mess, we won&#39;t be there to help like we are now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you can share any links of that I&#39;d love to see it. </p>

<p>I have 2 kids. If all of a sudden I was claiming there were 3 and one of them was dead, there would just be so many people from intimate friends, to facebook friends that would say: yo, listen up this chick only ever had 2 kids we ever saw... it&#39;s really the part that makes it hard for me to accept that it&#39;s a hoax. </p>

<p>Because there are things that are strange about it...just that one thing doesnt add up.</p>

<p>I feel like JFK, and even 9/11  - whatever the truth may be, many, many less people were involved in the cover up.</p>

<p>If they really all did just move there and and move back out, that is highly suspect definitely. Im applying the lens of everyone having been there, and still being there (only bc I havent yet encountered the opposite info)</p>

<p>Who? Where? When?</p>

<p>You mean there were <em>claims</em> on the internet that <em>unnamed</em> Connecticut State Police spoke out.</p>

<p>By the way, there were officers from at least 10 federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies in the school that day.</p>

<p>&quot;investigators&quot;</p>

<p>Maybe people in Sandy Hook think you&#39;re all a bunch of terrible people and don&#39;t want you around?  Have you considered that possible explanation?</p>
