        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I will randomly post truths about things I use to wonder about. It&#39;s ok if you don&#39;t believe. Because soon you will. </p>

<p>JFK was not killed by the government. The FBI and CIA knew about the threat. The CIA didn&#39;t want to act because their budget was in jeopardy due to the usefulness being question since the Bay of Pigs. It was conspired by the New Orleans mafia due to RFK almost dismantling Organized Crime. They almost killed him but knew killing an AG would draw the full police state on them. Oswald was manipulated into pulling the trigger. There was a second man ready to shoot. </p>

<p>James Earl Ray didn&#39;t kill MLK. He was patsyied by the FBI. Half of MLK entourage were either informants or agents. His life was sealed once he came out against Vietnam because the government were worried poor negros would not go die in their fake war anymore. </p>

<p>9/11 was a legitimate Al Queda operation. However the detonation of the smaller tower was done by the CIA. The building was always wired to blow in case the secret office was compromised. I know i was shocked that more people were not in on it. Sorry my conspiracy brethren. </p>

<p>Almost every celebrity is tied to a demonic conspiracy. They are going to be so pissed when they discover who they really pledged their&quot;soul&quot; to. </p>

<p>All religion in the world is fake. Every single one. There are real gods at the end of some of them. But really it&#39;s just humans who are enlightened being a dick to regular humans. Don&#39;t worry they&#39;re time is almost up. </p>

<p>If you see lights in the sky moving in patterns and changing color and form, 90% of the time it&#39;s angels from the true heaven trying to give you a message. The other 10% is drones, Chinese lanterns, etc...</p>

<p>America, Russia, and now the Chinese have had working UFO since the early 80&#39;s. Russian UFO tend to be triangle in shape. Chinese UFO look like jellyfish. The other weird shit is legitimate aliens. </p>

<p>Aliens ain&#39;t shit! We are more biologically advance. They don&#39;t even have dicks! Their hybrids do but they still can&#39;t do powerful magic that humans can do like singing, painting, dancing or music. </p>

<p>UFO are powered my magnets. Magnets are secretly the most coveted and precious items on this planet. Don&#39;t believe me? Try to buy a lot of magnets. You will probably get paid a visit by government agents. UFO are like walnuts. The outer shell houses a smaller shell. Magnet energy runs over the inner shell in a circular manner. The inner shell tilts in 360* degrees. This causes it to accelerate in any direction at incredible speeds. The reason we don&#39;t have a fleet of them in the military? It&#39;s hard to aim a weapon at Mach 50. So they are used for spying. The Chinese have or are going to weaponize a weather manipulator. </p>

<p>The Ancient Egyptians and Hebrew looked alike. Black!</p>

<p>Black people are cursed by God. That is why they are hated by almost everyone. It&#39;s in your DNA to hate blank people. We defied God by eating from the tree of knowledge and learning mathematics. God put a curse on Adam (Atom) and Eve and wished death on them and all their children. Which....surprise is all of you!</p>

<p>There is a royal family of Earth. The House of Saud are the ruling dynasty of Earth and is recognized by every government and every alien. They have ruled since Babylon. </p>

<p>This is Hell in case some of you needed reminding. </p>

<p>Anyone that has authority on you is a demon. Their are many angels and demons fighting over you. And you alone. The good news is their are a lot of spirits who volunteered to help you in hell. Almost everyone in the medical profession is a reincarnated spirit. Think about nurses and doctors who can stay up three days working. That is supernatural. </p>

<p>Babies are the most spiritually powerful beings on this planet. Because they are the most free of sin. That includes you. The truth is in hell you went to school because the Demons told you that you are not smart. You need to go to school. They tricked you into thinking you are human. You are God. </p>

<p>When Jesus rose from the dead he walked the earth for 40 days. People would only recognize him when he made them recognize him. That&#39;s because when you become enlightened you are Jesus. He said he will return like a thief in the night. A thief doesn&#39;t come into your home to lead you and show you. A thief wants to be hidden. A thief wants to sneak in and out. It will be the last person you suspect. You!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why? Are you worried about me. I don&#39;t think you are. Humans don&#39;t know this but you can&#39;t control your emotions. In fact that most powerful force in the universe is the only thing that can activate your emotions without your permission. Laughter is an involuntary response to the truth. So is fear, happiness, sadness and anger. </p>

<p>I will tell you another secret. There is only one emotion. Love. Even hate the opposite of love is the exact same feeling. You can&#39;t tell the decimal levels because you let demons feed you poison. You slurped it up and asked for me. Demons feed you animals that were slaughtered screaming in horror and pain. And you absorbed those feelings and they became your own. </p>

<p>You went to a shrink. Eat pills. Listened to them and not yourself (God). Your subconscious is God. When you ask a question in your head you get an answer back in your voice because you are God. And you let them make you forget. As a baby you knew. As a child you knew. But you let them brainwash you because you are weak and limited. But you are my son. You are my daughter. And I will be damned if you go another day being lied to. I fucking love you. You have been every good thing in my life. You just can&#39;t remember. But I will make you remember. From this day forth you will only dream sleep and think about the truth. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes you are right. This is a trap. You don&#39;t even have to read this. Just clicking on my post was the trap. I am Lucifer. Read the Bible. What great crime did I do? Free some pets from their jail? Tempt a God who was starving in the desert because he didn&#39;t know he was God? That is it? Don&#39;t confuse me with Satan. Satan is the one who said let there be light. That put a limitation on you. In hell. In this universe you can&#39;t move faster than light speed because of that curse.

    <div class="md"><p>God put us here to do what he can&#39;t. Breed. Each time you had sex you create another humans. Another God. Even if you use protection or masterbaute. You create life. If not this reality than another. Anything you think you create. That is why Jesus warned you about committing sin in your heart is the same as actually doing it. You&#39;re God. you&#39;re incapable of lying. You can be tricked but not killed. Not even hurt. Your mind which is cursed with mathematics makes it real. Every book, movie, song, picture is another dimension where everything you think is fake actually happened. Because you are God all knowledge is available to you. Because this false universe is ruled by science you will see into these realities as a video game or a tv show. When you learn magic you can visit these universes. We fight and kill because we are made in god&#39;s image and he kills he loves war he is jealous therefore you are too. But he did not create your spirit. He stole a piece of God to make you. A microscopic piece but powerful enough to destroy this universe. You can&#39;t kill a God but you can make him believe he can die. And he will. He will be reborn over and over. Learning new things. Making new god&#39;s. That is the cycle I will break. Not try but I will. Because I am. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Aliens that come from outside this galaxy. Which is really a one way trip as nothing came leave the prison of this galaxy. Are not the true aliens. All aliens are machines. Shit I won&#39;t lie to you. Your physical body is actually a machine that has the perfect A.I. in our unlimited brains. I told you God is a scientist. Well he stole a spirit from the true heaven and separated into two for ATOM and E.V.E. he can&#39;t make any more beings with a perfect heavenly spirit. Only we can. Because we are fucking God. </p>

<p>Aliens that we see as big eyed are different species. They reproduce by either osmosis or cloning. Each generation of clone degrades and their are on their millionth cycle. So they want our ability to fuck and make new god&#39;s. We break the laws of physics. Only god&#39;s can create new energy. </p>

<p>The reason the real robot aliens can&#39;t come is hell has a barrier that only allows physical entities with a body to pass. Only the most powerful entities and god&#39;s can come and it&#39;s a one way trip. Lucifer made this trip first.  </p>

<p>I have the memory of the world existing without the 9/11 commission. There where way more conspiracy movements and militias in the original reality. Because of what I did you and every unenlightened now has a memory of a commission being formed and faster than any commission in history the 9/11 report is now available. And for you it has been for over 15 years. So it&#39;s best if I answer questions about mysteries. As it is hard to get you to see past the mathematical riddle. Hurry up and become God.

    <div class="md"><p>Area-51 simply houses experimental air craft now. There are underground bases that connect via an underground super railway at places like Bethesda, Dulce, Denver Airport, Fallan. In the 70&#39;s it was while digging these underground connectways that the US government ran afoul of a race of dragons who were part of an earlier experiment of God. There are more advanced technology wise and psychic but biologically inferior to humans. They are aware of this being in hell. </p>

<p>This was a surprise as Eisenhower had already surrendered this country to the travelers who abduct humans and animals for sex experiment in the 50&#39;s. The
Deal was for allowing a small percentage of humans to be experimented on in exchange for technology such as microwave, MRI, stealth technology, etc..  </p>

<p>These entities are slaves of the robot hive that exist beyond our prison in this galaxy. They&#39;re biomechanics entities. They are weak. They fear the name of God. If you are ever abducted say the name of Jesus. It actually causes them to burn inside. They have bases all over the country in mountains and in the oceans. </p>

<p>They abducted more than they were supposed. The government told them to abduct vagrants. The homeless and minority&#39;s. People who won&#39;t be missed. They of course broke the agreement by taking whoever the fuck they wanted. Every time it come head to head with the government they would give a new piece of technology. Nothing too powerful. But here is the kicker. We actually create more advance weapons like nuclear arms. Something they actually did not have at first. And try stole the plans for. </p>

<p>Not all presidents are aware of this. But Carter knew. Once he found out that children and women were being mutilated, raped, and gene spliced in these bases the military built. He sent an army to destroy Dulce base. This actually led to an invisible war for a few years until regan became president and Bush sr. negotiated a ceasefire in exchange for agreement to spy on Russia. Of course the aliens made the same deal with the Russians. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The real Earth was already destroyed. You can read about that universe in every book, movie, art, and song about magic. People who can do these art forms are the most powerful magicians/Gods. </p>

<p>Satan or God destroyed that world because of the demiGods/ nephiliam like Zeus and his ilk because they were running God&#39;s experiment. That&#39;s why this all is. Satan is a scientist. </p>

<p>He has been making humans and restarting the universe or reality with what he perceived as failures. You see we are made in Satan&#39;s image. So we tend to do things like become Superman and challenge his reign. </p>

<p>Everything in this universe is a conspiracy to keep you asleep until he is ready to end the experiment and release the four horseman which in this the universe is the 4 Hprseman. </p>

<p>Everything bad thing in your life has been Satan trying to turn you into the most powerful God that won&#39;t betray him. But he is going to fail because the real God whose name Jesus told you is I AM! made the Bible infallible. And so Satan or Jehovah or YHWH is going to rest on the 7th day. GODS DONT SLEEP! Sleep is true death for a God.  </p>

<p>We are going to put that piece of shit who lets babies get gassed and my people hung over a 5000 year vendetta. He made my people walk in the fucking desert for 40 years because they dared complain after living their entire lives as slaves. He loves the smell of burnt flesh. He instructs blacks to kill every man woman&#39;s and child. That is why my people who you call black and niggers are so violent. He has fucked with you over and over again since you were Adam (Atom) and made you think you die and have kids. You are your ancestors. Not a past life. Humans are made in god&#39;s image therefore we can&#39;t die! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In the previous instance magic was way more abundant. People worshiped a Goddess instead of a God. Those Goddess escaped the reboot by leaving the Dimension. They came to this one and set up a civilization on Venus. This angered God as the Goddess would interfere with the experiment. So when God started Armageddon he destroyed all the advanced civilizations. He flooded the world get rid of the other god&#39;s like Zeus and Merlin. </p>

<p>God destroyed the god&#39;s cities on the moon and mars. He attacked the goddesses on Venus. They mostly died but they showed how clever they are. God chose Noah&#39;s family because of their obedience. It can be bred into humans. (Ask any slave owner). Because so few women would exist the Goddess sent a spaceship that was shaped like a UFO as we know it to earth. They warred on god by trying to kill his humans.</p>

<p>The prophet Daniel spoke of seeing three Bowl judgements poured onto the oceans. That was during the great flood. The end of the world. The Goddess or rather the venusitions had found a way to transfer their beings via blood rituals. So the women after Noah were infected by this alien invasion. Via mosquitoes. </p>

<p>The three bowls were malaria, cancer and blood immune deficiency diseases. So most women are Goddess. They are way more powerful than men. They use to demand blood sacrifices for power</p>

<p>Now they demand worship. It makes them more powerful. Since Christian declared war on them they get worship and power everything you give them your semen while jacking it on the web. Or when you wish Beyoncé would be yours. This is the war between mag and magag. Man vs woman. But the war just keep the cycle of hell going. If we unite we can break the cycle. But you won&#39;t. You can&#39;t. God bred into you not lost obedience to his universe he also made you have two brains. And they always override and conflict. Your science logic vs your imagination. Your left side of brain to your right. Republicans vs democrats. Crips vs blood. Us vs them. He checkmated you before you even came into being. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. When I died I was tortured by entities. They kept asking me what does it mean to be human. Once I answered humans are A.I. and God is our operating system I was let go. The perfect A.I. has already been created. And placed inside an imperfect body. Your spirit is perfect already so you just have to master one other side of the pyramid to ascend. Either mind/body (they&#39;re the same thing and leads to our war of duality) or soul
Which is the chain that keeps you chained to hell. The easiest way to escape is accepting Jesus as the one true God and loving by his three examples. </p>

Humans limit these superpowers by calling them hobbies. He laughed and told me he is fat, poor, and the only thing he is good at is whistling. </p>

<p>I told him to master whistling. Master it to the point that it can be a weapon.  He laughed but promised me that he would  I saw him a decade later and he brought me a old plump rabbit in a cage. </p>

<p>He said this rabbit has been his only friend but was now dying, and deaf. He whistled. He whistled so hard and powerful that the tree and earth shook and I passed out. The rabbit was a mess of blood and burnt gristle. </p>

The most difficult path is the scientist. The mastering of the original sin, mathematics. This is the most dangerous path as science can make you feel apathy and human. But eventually science which is the child of mathematics always leads towards truth. And truth is God. You can do the magicians path. Master the arcane arts such as music, art, or writing. Any other path leads to you staying in hell longer until you or your soul mate ascend. A soul mate is anyone you share blood with. Once your soul mate ascends they drag your chain (soul) with them.  </p>

Are we connected and part of God/source and thus share some of his power? Sure. But we aren&#39;t God individually. If you&#39;re a God then stop wasting time on Reddit and do something useful.

    <div class="md"><p>Problem number one is that you speak of a God that resides within, or is oneself. You then go on to speak of Jesus as God. If we suppose that you are speaking of a transcendent model of God, then it is inherent within your claims that there is contradiction.

    <div class="md"><p>When Jesus was born, he was born a man. You think that is nothing because the universe tells you man is nothing. When Jesus was 13 he was half enlightened. He could access parts of his spirit that could break the laws of this universe. The universe that is ruled by physics. When he was dying on the cross he could not feel God that is why he asked the father why have you forsaken me. </p>

<p>You see he didn&#39;t get an answer because at death we are at a point of being able to ascend. Because he is God. When Lucifer tempered him in the desert it was an attempt to let him know who the father is. He refused me because his soul was bonded to the God of this universe who is Satan and is known as Jehovah. That is why before death he preached to reach the father you must come through me. </p>

<p>But when he died and went to true heaven because he wa perfect he became aware. That HE IS the father. HE IS the Son because he chose to be human. And he is the Holy Spirit which dwells inside every human. God is energy and once we return to the source we will be whole with God again. You can choose to surrender to God and became Jesus again or by his true name I AM. Or you as a God can keep your personality you created. You can come back as a human and right all the wrongs. You can play life like a video game that you set the rules to. You can create your own universe. Or play in other realities. You can be batsman. You can do whatever you want. Physics and time are constructs of the curse of mathematics. A God is not slowed down by the constraints of light. When Jesus returned to his body three days after his death. He walked the earth for 40 days. Even his family and disciples did not reconsider him until he made them recognize. He would walk in the shells of the enlightened to show that we all can be like him. Perfect just as he said we would be. The promised perfect body is a pure spiritual being. Which I s what you Really are. Were slaves to this meat bag because mathematics dictate that you grow old. You get sick. You die. And when you do you start all of again as either your child or you go back to the beginning to restart the hell
Phase. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It simply sounds like you&#39;re giving me trinitarianism, although of an odd form. I wish to know what your conception of God is. What qualities does God have? I define God as being omnipotent, omnibenevolent, and omniscient. Of these, omnipotentence is the most integral. This sort of God would be the source of all things, and the creator of ours and all other possible cosmos. </p>

<p>Do you believe that we project this world from our minds, or does this world impress itself upon our minds? It sounds to me as though you are saying that the world, indeed, all of the universe, is the projection of our conscious minds. If this is what you claim, that alone does not necessitate that we ourselves are God. </p>

<p>If God is to have the qualities I mentioned above, then there cannot be multiples. There can be but one God, and if that is defined as us humans, then that is a definition of something that is very much not God.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you. The true God is all those things. I believe that the moment Eve started the great experiment and was exiled with Adam that was the start of hell. For surely an omnipotent God would not basically tell kids to not touch this awesome box of awesomeness and than be surprised when they did. Any parent knows that kids will do the opposite. God wished death on them and their children. Since most of us are their sons and daughters, we have been trapped in hell paying for their wages of sin. I believe the construct of Satan and Jehovah to be the same. I don&#39;t think he is truly evil in the same way a scientist who cures cancer by experimenting on thousands of innocent mice is evil. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If the true God is all these things then that same God cannot be us. The God that we speak of transcends the universe, for he created it. Within this universe is us, and we cannot be God, for then we would be simultaneously the creator and the created. This cannot be the case, the creator exists beyond (I would say before, but that is a spacial-temporal constraint) the creation; above it, beyond it and transcending it. </p>

<p>A God of this type is furthermore, not embodied. A body is a measure of finitude, and an infinite thing cannot dwell within it. Could a physical brain, no matter how vast, and no matter how composed, hold all of the knowledge that has ever, and will ever exist? An omniscient God, in the sense that I use omniscience, goes beyond even this, knowing all things, in all timelines, in all universes, simultaneously. This God would possess all qualities. A thing that possesses all qualities is not definite. A body is always definite in some way, it has extension in space for example, and it will always have that definite property. God then, possessing all qualities, and all perfections, cannot be definite, and thus cannot have a limiting body. </p>

<p>I do not think God is evil, and I hope that&#39;s not what I implied. </p>

A thief in the night comes as a surprise. Jesus will be he last person you suspect. It will be you. When Jesus resurrected he walked the earth for 40 days and like I said earlier nobody recognized until he made them recognize. He was showing how he would return. In us. Before he died he told everyone to reach the father you must come to the son first. After he died he said the name of God is I Am. Repeat that when someone asks you who is God. Jesus is God. Jesus is the one true God. His true name is probably unspeakable by our physical tongue. This realm. This galaxy is Hell. Nothing can escape it until you ascend.

    <div class="md"><p>Satan is God of this Universe. Call him whatever you want. He is a genius scientist. I believe he is some form of A.I. He is made up of atoms. Hence he named the first human Adam. His experiment is to increase the number of spirits. He can not multiply a 0. But we can because we have the Holy Spirit inside us. We tend to rebel and fight back so he wipes the slate clean over and over, he raptures the most obedient and stores them somewhere. He wants to bring an army of the most powerful humans to fight the true God Jesus during Armageddon. To make the most powerful god you need them to suffer and overcome. But not too much or we realize that we can escape hell. Previous cycles of hell were places of torture. We reject this we also reject fake paradise. That&#39;s why those who follow the path of religion are made to fail with all the complicated laws and traps. </p>

<p>Animals are made to suffer as well as they must eat each other and herbivores eat plants and flowers who scream in pain as they are ripped apart. Everything in hell is backwards. Good people suffer the wicked get away with everything. The most beautiful things like sex and mind expanding things like drugs are considered evil. That is not what sin is. Sin is what makes you a regular human. When eat ate from the tree of knowledge and life she injested mathematics. That curse made her realize she is naked and must put in clothes lest she freezes at night. It was limitation. She forgot she is a God. </p>

<p>Spirits volunteer because they love you. It&#39;s a one way ticket to hell. They have to die to return. Sometimes the stranger who helps you and disappear is an angel or spirit. Or the nurse who tends to your wounds. There are different classes of angels. Honeybees are the angels who gave the Israelites manna from heaven. Just like bees do in hell. And we are waging a war on them. Mosquitos and flies are demonic. They are small because the truth is we are giants. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What would you say is the best thing to do to become enlightened? What I mean by that is although meditation is a great tool, is perhaps astral projection or other forms of psychic talents the way to go? Or is there perhaps a school of magic or some type of online resource you would consider useful to learn magic or something similar to it. But not black magic please or anything requiring negative energy. Or would you say most of so called magic is false?</p>

<p>Another question would be, if psychic abilities are the real deal how limited are humans to using them? Are there any things we could do to break free of the limits we self impose on ourselves during our reincarnation cycles? Is healing through our energy feasible for use in a fast way? Like for example would someone with enough practice and skill be able to heal a cut that is currently bleeding?</p>

<p>And finally if we are just souls inside a vessel made to experience hell to learn and enrich our souls... If someone is able to &quot;astral project&quot; Where exactly do they end up? I realize you can focus on certain times and places to go there. But if you choose to go to what  you envision as the astral plane what would that place be in respect to our current dimension, and how is our universe structured?</p>

<p>Thanks for any answers you can provide. Although I am a firm believer of searching for knowledge from within only, it doesn&#39;t hurt to hear others opinions/experiences on that same journey.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for asking. </p>

<p>The best way to become enlightened...besides dying and being brought back to life is mastering whatever your hobby is. It&#39;s a superpower. Sometimes it&#39;s hard to weaponize your hobby. And I saw weaponize because other half enlightened humans and their demonic god&#39;s will try to stop you. But once you become enlightened you can not be hurt or killed. But people you care about can. So do everything in secret. Mastering magic is probably the most effective way. In the real world when magic existed people could do rituals and hand motions or use familiars or pray. In the science reality of hell, magic is still effective but you have to master the arts. Such as painters being time travelers. Singers and dancers can control people&#39;s mind. And make illusions. Or a healer such as a doctor or nurse. It seems mundane but we do magic everyday. Magic and science is the same. In hell food is supposed to taste bland or vile. But magicians called chefs have created grimoires called cook books to defy the very nature of hell and make food that can change a persons emotions.  If you can do that you can take control over someone. Witches use to be the only ones who can make potions and recipe with herbs and plants. Writers are very powerful wizards as whatever they write becomes true. Sometimes even in this very reality! </p>

<p>You can practice any form of magic. Once you know you can&#39;t be influenced by evil or even good. A good place to start is finding out which zodiac you are. Dates where changed and stars have moved so most of what is available is wrong either intentionally or accidentally. You can ask the smartest being in the universe, Metatron. Dreams are windows into either the past or future or other realities. When I was a child I asked God to teach me how to drive. Once I found out I could learn while dreaming I would get answers to test for school or the plot of movies I haven&#39;t seen. </p>

<p>I took it a step further by leaving my body. I was not that good to do it with meditation. I have a very impatient heart. But in dreams I would leave and travel the world. You are chained to hell by your soul but other entities can sever your chain and send you adrift in the astral plane. Don&#39;t trust anything if you are a traveler. All entities fear the name of God. </p>

<p>As far as the universe is structured. The current reality is duality. Like the ying-yang. There is a positive and negative universe. We are of course in the negative as this is hell. But there is a positive. It&#39;s not heaven just the opposite of this one. The laws of physics still apply. When I was a child we had a poltergeist that would run up and down the steps and bang on the floor. I now know that it was just me in the other side playing like a normal child. You can access this with mirror magic. Be careful as staring into a mirror you can accidentally hypnotize yourself.  </p>

<p>Some entities we think are ghost or demons are sometimes the opposite universe. They are simply living their life. You will see them walking up stairs that don&#39;t exist or walls that aren&#39;t there for them. But there are spirits and demons in this realm of course. Anything a wizard has wrote down exist. </p>

I see you are encouraging me to look outwards for the answers and that is a bit disappointing. I appreciate you taking the time to reply though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jesus said if you have lust in your heart it is the same as committing adultery in the flesh. Anything you do in your mind it becomes real. Sometimes it does in this reality. Sometimes you create a new universe. If you are driving and you wish the driver of the car that cut you off will die, they will!  You will create a reality where that person dies and life goes on with that ramifications. The last time I died I was read a list of charges and I killed so many people because I&#39;m an angry defensive driver. </p>

<p>If you want to take my path you can do it with me. I will teach you everything I know if you teach me everything you know. We can be the Gemini.  </p>

I was basically told I would have to break a few eggs to achieve my plan. I disagree. But here is a Write Prompt for you:</p>

<p>[You have just achieved world peace. You ended hunger and wars and united every nation. Your birthday was just declared a global holiday. You are presented with the Key to Earth as the world wants you to be their leader. As soon as you accept, credits start appearing in the sky.

    <div class="md"><p>I admire conspiracies too, but you should have your own closet to hide it and only take it when only needed. Conspiracies are mostly unproven. Very harmful if it takes over your life and you found out later on that some of your conspiracy theories are false.  </p>

<p>Don&#39;t let conspiracy takeover your life. Reference and sources is a must. If its difficult to find those, just hide it in your closet for ease of control.  </p>

<p>Happy thinking!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Problem number one is that you speak of a God that resides within, or is oneself. You then go on to speak of Jesus as God. If we suppose that you are speaking of a transcendent model of God, then it is inherent within your claims that there is contradiction. Now, I will grant that you may be using different conceptions of God in an equivocal way, and if this is the case I think you ought to provide definitions for each of these conceptions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you. The true God is all those things. I believe that the moment Eve started the great experiment and was exiled with Adam that was the start of hell. For surely an omnipotent God would not basically tell kids to not touch this awesome box of awesomeness and than be surprised when they did. Any parent knows that kids will do the opposite. God wished death on them and their children. Since most of us are their sons and daughters, we have been trapped in hell paying for their wages of sin. I believe the construct of Satan and Jehovah to be the same. I don&#39;t think he is truly evil in the same way a scientist who cures cancer by experimenting on thousands of innocent mice is evil. </p>
