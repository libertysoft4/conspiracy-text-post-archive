    <div class="md"><p>You got proof of someone telling people to ignore this topic? Or is the lack of stories what you are worried about? You so badly want this discussed because you know its partisan? </p>

<p>Fact: Lynch asked Comey to call to the Clinton investigation as a matter to the public. This is the testimony of Comey and I believe it. Problem is no where did he make the claim that she was trying to end the investigation this the thing many people around here need to true because then its is a &quot;SEE THE DEMS ARE TERRRIBLE TOO!&quot; and they can use it to justify Trumps actions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The policy is to not confirm investigations in such circumstances.  The Hatch Act is intended to prevent officials influencing the outcome of elections in their official capacity, say by confirming an investigation despite the fact that this is contrary to policy and using the most sensational language possible to do so.</p>

<p>You seem to think the duty is to ensure the public know there is an investigation but the usual policy and the Hatch Act meant the duty was to be extra careful to keep that information private.  Circumstances made that impractical but the notion that they didn&#39;t have a duty to minimize the harm and further actually had a duty to make sure their unusual departure from policy had maximum impact is bonkers and completely backwards.</p>

<p>For what purpose?   Comey&#39;s testimony indicates Lynch didn&#39;t take any steps to influence the investigation and she&#39;s left the job.  It&#39;s obviously a stupid and unprofessional thing to do and if she were still at her job it would be absolutely essential to address that but now she no longer has that job, what other than call her actions stupid and unprofessional is there to do about it?</p>

<p>Because he directly referenced email correspondence in his possession that gave evidence of misconduct on the part of Lynch, and that same email correspondence is what is referenced and expanded upon in further detail in the Senate Judiciary Committee letter that I linked and that you didn&#39;t read.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Er, you need to re-read that letter.  It doesn&#39;t say the FBI have an email in which Lynch makes such a promise.  It says there is a Russian document that cites a &quot;supposed&quot; email in which DWS is presented as having told someone that Lynch told this to some yet other person (in Clinton&#39;s campaign).  </p>

<p>You&#39;ll note that it is asserted that Comey testified this complicated things but he didn&#39;t say it was because he had any concerns about Lynch obstructing justice but rather that the information might leak causing a perception problem.  Why do you think that it is?  Do you think it&#39;s because Comey actually believes Lynch said that or is it likely that he believes something else, such as that the Russians produced that document and deliberately ensured it ended up on the FBI&#39;s desk despite the supposed email it refers to never having existed?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So what you are saying is that it is basically okay for Lynch to have Comey publically state that Clinton is not under investigation (&quot;It is a &#39;matter&#39;&quot;) when she was under investigation, but it is <em>not</em> okay for Trump to request that Comey state he wasn&#39;t under investigation when he in fact wasn&#39;t?

<p>The policy is to not call it anything at all - to not confirm it at all.  The Hatch Act obliges them to not negatively impact a candidate&#39;s presidential campaign in their official roles.  If they must refer to it at all, it&#39;s not suspicious that they use language that best serves the intent of the Hatch Act by minimizing damage to someone&#39;s presidential campaign.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not a Trump supporter, but I&#39;ve seen a lot of attacks on Trump and very little evidence.  I mean, I don&#39;t think Trump is a good president by any metric (he&#39;s a self serving sociopathic businessman), but he&#39;s certainly no worse than the last four.   Why is the establishment losing there minds trying to take him down?</p>

<p>On the other hand, the AG of the United States obstructing an investigation is a serious crime, especially if it was for political reasons.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>At a Senate hearing earlier this month, Mr. Comey told lawmakers that Ms. Lynch had attempted to change the way the FBI described its probe of Mrs. Clinton’s use of a private email server. The change appeared to dovetail with how Mrs. Clinton’s supporters were characterizing the probe.</p>

<p>The policy is to not call it anything at all - to not confirm it at all.  The Hatch Act obliges them to not negatively impact a candidate&#39;s presidential campaign in their official roles.  If they must refer to it at all, it&#39;s not suspicious that they use language that best serves the intent of the Hatch Act by minimizing damage to someone&#39;s presidential campaign.  </p>
