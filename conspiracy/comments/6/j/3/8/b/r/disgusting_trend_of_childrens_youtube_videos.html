        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>QUICK RUNDOWN ON #PED0TUBE 
There&#39;s a sick trend happening on Youtube, it&#39;s probably been going on for a long time but just recently got discovered by someone on /pol/. It&#39;s simulated fetish videos involving kids.
All the videos have the same patterns, same colour used, mostly the same fictional characters (mainly Disney like Elsa or Marvel like Spiderman), some of them are animated, some of them are live action filming with poor quality actors, props and sets. 
If you search for these channels, the first several videos are very innocent looking for the unsuspecting eye, but once you get deeper into the suggested videos, they get very nefarious. Gradually they present very worrying topics that are absolutely not appropriate for children to watch. 
Here is a partial list of the topics we can find:</p>

<p>sexual and violent behaviours
blood
injections
surgeries
pregnancy
abortion
pissing
scat
violent incidents
kidnapping
being buried
being restrained
suicide</p>

<p>The proportion of this phenomenon is massive: there are hundreds of Youtube channels proposing this contents, which are easy to realize, come out at a very fast pace, and are realized in several languages: english, spanish, russian, arabic, hebrew, japanese, vietnamese and more.</p>

<p>Also, each of these videos has massive amounts of views: we are talking about something such as hundreds of thousands or millions. However, they&#39;ve never trended on Youtube and most of the users never heard about them.</p>

<p>With the demise of television and rise of Internet media such as Youtube, parents have replaced kids tv shows with Youtube videos like these.
There&#39;s even a recommended list of kids channels on Youtube, and thats why these have so many views, that generate an impressive revenue because of advertisements. </p>

<p>Children may even watch these videos with their parents, as they also have &quot;&quot;decent&quot;, if you could say that, videos that are kid friendly to probably confuse parents into thinking it is okay for their kids to watch. Often, instead of actually parenting, some people plop their kids down in front of the TV or with a tablet. Youtube algorithms end up suggesting this content as there is a massive amount of it always ready to go on auto-play. In all likelihood these videos are being pushed up by bots to have more views and subscribers, to make it easier to end up on the recommended videos. </p>

<p>So are these videos just clickbait for a quick rich scheme or are they funded and pushed for other reasons? </p>

<p>Money is more likely a motivating factor, but since many videos violate Youtube policy about content, but still Youtube isn&#39;t removing them, it does make one wonder if this is some deliberate pushing of subliminal messages upon the very young so that they have no &#39;moral compass&#39; while growing up. 
Maybe these videos have the purpose of grooming children by making them familiar with perverted and violent behaviours, to get the kids into the mindset of adult perverts, an actual brainwashing of children&#39;s susceptible minds so that when they are approached by real life prowlers they are in the mindset of playing some game and act docile.
Another sickening possibility is that the pedophiles might be using this networks of kid Youtube channels to communicate. </p>

<p>Some of the comments left by the users are quite odd, even when we leave out the bot-generated comments and the sequences of gibberish and emojis left by toddlers who tap on keyboards and tablets. </p>

<p>Even the names of the clips aren&#39;t coherent titles, they just contain the common word (for example, &quot;Pregnant&quot;) associated to some fantasy characters, so that the child sees something familiar and clicks it. If this isn&#39;t just any money garnering scheme, these may very well be inter-connected channels that are used to communicate with various trafficking rings, on a global scale no less. 
What we see here could be secretly placed innuendos, hidden messages that only a select few can truly understand and interpret to communicate. These messages are hidden anywhere, from in the video to the thumbnail itself. Automated AIs are not entirely random in their uploads, a selective procedure is used to pick certain categories of messages - whether the video is going to be used to communicate or as an offer to any buyer. 
So, are these sex trafficking rings using a system of AIs to control and propagate these videos throughout Youtube to spread secret messages? Maybe there are hidden terms or innuendos within these videos that serve as a means of secretly communicating, and maybe the reason these videos get so many views is to make them easier to find for the true demographic which are child sex trafficking rings. </p>

<p>Maybe these pedophiles are using Youtube as some sort of cryptic messaging system and to lure the children through the comment section of the videos.
Whole thing is rather suspicious on many levels, and one might wonder if it is not some sort of psyop. 
It&#39;s a given that continuous severe trauma to the mind at a young age (eg witnessing violence at a young age) causes the mind to compartmentalize itself in order to protect itself, the new baseline compartments &quot;identities&quot; are able to be programmed by constant reinforcement and even triggered through color coding, words, actions etc, whatever trigger was programmed to bring that mindstate out.</p>

<p>If this isn&#39;t a global trafficking ring right under the nose of everyone, this is a large scale child brainwash at the very least.</p>

<p>Kids search for their favourite fantasy heroes on Google and Youtube, so they click on the recommended videos that end up leading them to these awful contents, since most kids don&#39;t have an attention span it&#39;s easy for them to fall into these clips. </p>

<p>The better question is why Youtube is not censoring this stuff for the kids, as some of it clearly does not respect the policy content set by youtube itself. We can still see this stuff come up even with using their so called &quot;Youtube for kids&quot; or Youtube censor setting. And, if they are really so popular, why haven&#39;t the creators been sued by Disney or Marvel and the content removed for copyright infringement?</p>

<p>Whatever the true purpose behind these videos is, one thing is for sure: this cannot continue any further, the informations about it must be spread to the public, Youtube must take down the inappropriate content, and the individuals behind the channels that spread it must be identified and questioned.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For the love of fuck that was disturbing. And one of the recommended videos was a little boy dressed as a doctor, holding a giant syringe with the needle poking into the giant distended (pregnant?) belly of another little boy. What in the actual hell is going on here???? I&#39;m skeptical about the &quot;sex trafficking communications&quot; because that seems like a <em>very</em> roundabout and difficult way of going about it. I also don&#39;t see how that would work at all, please elaborate on your theory. But this is wildly inappropriate material for kids, the comments alone are sickening. Deeply sinister and unsettling for a reason I can&#39;t put my finger on. What is their plan, exactly....?</p>

Kids love gross things. Poop, pee, farts, adults acting like babies. So these channels exploit that for views. </p>

<p>then there&#39;s the self-uploaded videos of girls dancing in skimpy clothes but these kind of videos and the comments and playlists from 3rd world pedos have always been there. It&#39;s not really a conspiracy and it&#39;s unrelated to the other kind of superhero vids</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think if your site has content that is geared towards adults in anyway, it should be like the old days. Give a &quot;are you above 18?&quot; And then make them answer a question. So that means anything that has content for 18 year olds, as YouTube definitely has videos for mature audiences, rather then have them segregated by user page or genre, straight up &quot;this site has mature content. Are you older than 18? Answer this question.&quot; That&#39;s the only way to make it safe and get around and away from strict Internet regulations like registering your personal info to use it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think if I put on my conspiracy-est conspiracy theorist hat, I&#39;d speculate that youtube is a great venue for learning and that&#39;s the problem. Kids start out there learning about the alphabet and could continue on to learning to play an instrument via youtube lessons, learning gymnastics or karate, learning anything. Maybe that&#39;s the threat. So now &quot;good&quot; parents can&#39;t let their kids use youtube unsupervised because it is bad. And so kids won&#39;t get the same opportunity to learn and develop their brains and turn into thinkers who think and question. Not that I believe it&#39;s more than click-bait but anything is possible, I guess.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Porn is hard to define, but you know it when you see it.</p>

<p>I watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJZY8e1rKGQ">Philip DeFranco talk about this YouTuber that is being charged with creating child porn for getting teens to twerk</a>.  It has two million views.  What he did seems disgusting, distasteful, and not something I&#39;d ever watch, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s porn.  The reason being, it&#39;s not porn when Miley Cyrus does it.  It&#39;s just bad taste.  It&#39;s wrong to sexualize these young girls, and probably criminal, but it&#39;s not porn.</p>

<p>I watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIjwHqXNFoI">YouTuber Pockets of the Future discuss the Olsen Twins &quot;Bizarre Pizza Video,&quot;</a> (750,00 views) and I believe that Olsen Twins video from Full House was created and posted as porn.</p>

<p>Never seen any of these videos, but I know they exist because of the Pockets of the Future video.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a difference between porn and dance, even if both are sexual.</p>

<p>Right now I think they are going after the wrong group.</p>

<p>I get that he got teens to send videos of them twerking; there&#39;s nothing more than that.</p>

<p>My point is that twerking is not porn.</p>

<p>Maybe what he did is criminal, but it&#39;s not production of porn.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Um, they are charging him for producing child porn.</p>

<p>This post is about &quot;thousands of these videos and each has millions of views,&quot; which are actual child porn.</p>

<p>Charge the guy for the crime he committed, and charge these others with production of child porn.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not defending him.  Sexualizing a child is not production of child porn, or you are you suggesting that it is?</p>

<p>I&#39;m saying, based on that Pockets of the Future video, there is real child porn, and it seems just as important if not more important.</p>

<p>It matters because that&#39;s what they charged him with.  If it&#39;s just videos of girls dancing, it&#39;s not near as evil as this other shit.</p>

<p>The real threat is not in &#39;subliminal messages&#39; or MK ULTRA brainwashing from these weird videos, (though they are stupidly gross) the real threat is what the kids come in contact with with everything surrounding the Elsa/Spiderman video.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>So I&#39;ve been keeping up with this #Elsagate, #PedoTube thing for the past few days when its been getting a lot of attention, doing my own research, checking the /pol/ info, etc. </p>

<p>Seems like these weird Eastern European videos about spider-man and Elsa and all this weird shit are pretty much just that . . . just weird shit designed by a different culture to be &#39;&#39;&#39;humorour&#39;&#39;&#39; and that the bar was set super-low to appeal to children. The violence and odd thematic content is just a different culture for the most part.</p>

<p>The odd stuff is, like the OP said, when you start the &#39;digging&#39; -- when you start looking at the profiles of commenters and going through a few cycles of the recommended bar. </p>

<p>You&#39;ll come to a lot of young, foreign girls taking baths/showers, a lot of young girls playing around (not in an overtly sexual manner) with each other, and the ABSOLUTE CREEPIEST comments I&#39;ve ever seen on a Youtube video.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve posted in a few different threads on a few different subreddits about this, so if you want some rabbit-hole shit, I&#39;ve posted some before, and people responding to the posts have done same major work too. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t understand why r/Conspiracy keeps pushing these weird Elsa/Spider-man videos as some kind of crux other than the entry-point for a lot of kids (I&#39;m assuming); because there is much, MUCH more worrying stuff just around the corner, and out in the open on Youtube that we&#39;re just learning about en masse.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>True. </p>

<p>That video was almost immediately taken down after being reported.</p>

<p>My point is that if one video of that was on Youtube, there are more, and there is a lot more innocently-filmed but perversely advertised or perversely taken. I think this community is approaching the whole thing in the wrong way. Classic pareidolia. </p>

<p>But that doesn&#39;t mean there isn&#39;t really degenerate stuff going on just beneath the surface that needs to be brought to the light and exposed. Like the pedophiles who are commenting on girl&#39;s videos, or how parents just mindlessly let their kids wander into these situations to be exploited or to watch the exploitation.</p>

<p>I just think if we follow the rabbit-holes with Elsa/Spider-man sign-posts looking for some conspiracy, its going to be disappointing. If we go in looking for pedophiles and trends between videos (who is commenting, where the videos are coming from, etc.) then we&#39;ll actually make head-way.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My take: Pedogate people use these to condition and brainwash the kids they kidnap, thats why its a progression fron from normal to extreme and uses well known characters, and why its in most languages.</p>

<p>They probably play these videos on a loop where theyre holding the kids, hence why theres so many views. Disturbing to think about it, theyre using these to basically reprogram a childs mind and what they consider normal, by associating bizarre things with characters they know.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Last summer I worked as a babysitter for this kid who was kind of a wild child. Admittedly, I would encourage him to spend time on his IPad because he was so damned uncontrollable and it kept him occupied and in one place. It was basically his favourite pass-time so it wasn&#39;t hard.</p>

<p>This is how I became acquainted with these videos... I sat with him, either watching with him or hovering nearby but always keeping an eye on the content. </p>

<p>He would sit and watch these, video after video, clicking the links and just watching this weird shit all day. I remember having this strange feeling like I was watching something that wasn&#39;t ACTUALLY content for children. It was odd. It was like it was pretending to be educational, but it wasn&#39;t actually educational. It was PRETENDING to be something it wasn&#39;t. I remember thinking &quot;who makes these...?&quot; while I heard the same themes, same characters, same song, same 5 colours mentioned over and over... </p>

<p>There  was this one specific theme that I always got stuck in my head and felt particularly &quot;wtf&quot; about; this song featured in many of the videos, a song about fingers. But it wasn&#39;t teaching the viewer anything; it was like nonsensical associations of very specific themes. </p>

<p>Anyway, a year later, and all this shit is blowing up.... and I still don&#39;t know what to make of it. I know that was long and rambling and I apologize. Basically I just wanted to say that some of the guesses in this post about how children consume these videos is dead-on, because I watched it happen myself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They are using any character known by kids. By searching traditional nursery rhymes in Spanish (I&#39;m from Mexico), I was suggested these disturbing and creepy videos. The titles are in Spanish but the name of the channels are in English (maybe they&#39;re not made in Mexico and just translated).  And I think Youtube is involved they have too many videos with lots of views to not be noticed. They are not appropiated for kids, and are wrong even for adults! They are just wrong for everybody!</p>

    <div class="md"><h1>Summary</h1>

<p>Here&#39;s a rundown of findings not discussed in other comments.  </p>

<hr/>

<h3>Censorship</h3>

<hr/>

<p>1) Users on 4chan are being banned for simply replying to ELSAGATE threads. Discussion of this topic is now completely banned on 4chan.</p>

<p>Some examples of users being banned: <a href="http://imgur.com/cliYUfH">1</a>, <a href="http://imgur.com/LMmKdf5">2</a>, <a href="http://imgur.com/q44D6gi">3</a></p>

<hr/>

<h3>Massive Bot Network</h3>

<hr/>

<p>1) ELSAGATE videos have an enormous number of views. </p>

<p>For example, this video has <a href="http://imgur.com/DpczEZq">HALF A BILLION views</a>. That&#39;s on par with some of <a href="http://imgur.com/a/EULze">Justin Bieber&#39;s popular videos</a>.  </p>

<p>2) One anon has found the number of comments per views for ELSAGATE videos is much lower than other videos with a similar number of views on YouTube.  </p>

<p>3) Many of the comments are complete gibberish: <a href="http://imgur.com/oXgfgjL">1</a>, <a href="http://imgur.com/xsJVSWI">2</a>, <a href="http://imgur.com/W3Xhg8X">3</a>, <a href="http://imgur.com/a/XQuXs">4</a>  </p>

<p>4) Some videos are dominated by human-like comments, some videos are dominated by bot-like comments. One anon has been data mining the comments section and put together <a href="http://imgur.com/Jh71OZh">word clouds for the comments in 4 different videos</a>.</p>

<hr/>

<h3>Gibberish Comments (User Profiles)</h3>

<hr/>

<p>1) One anon has found an unusual pattern in the people making the gibberish comments: <a href="http://imgur.com/ubpBGEg">1</a>, <a href="http://imgur.com/Gnf685M">2</a>  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>makes gibberish comment on ELSAGATE video<br/>
has less than 5 video uploads<br/>
has 0 subscribers<br/>
videos always named by date in some language<br/>
many videos of small children or babies (doing nothing bad)    </p>
</blockquote>

<hr/>

<h3>Gibberish Comments (Encoded Messages)</h3>

<hr/>

<p>1) Someone has suggested the gibberish comments might not be gibberish at all. Recently, security researchers found malware hackers using <a href="http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/security/news/a26798/russian-malware-britney-spears-instagram/">gibberish comments on Britney Spear&#39;s instagram</a> to communicate malware command and control websites.  </p>

<p>Here is how they used gibberish comments to <a href="http://imgur.com/4LatFW6">encode a link shortener address</a>.</p>

<p>Potential things gibberish comments might encode:  </p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://imgur.com/W3Xhg8X">onion address</a><br/>
bitly, other link shortener hash<br/>
google search term<br/>
passwords  </p>
</blockquote>

<hr/>

<h3>Gibberish Videos (Encoded Messages)</h3>

<hr/>

<p>1) One anon has found some VERY unusual and creepy videos that may be perfect for communicating hidden messages to users. More investigation needed.  </p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaJCyenuvSE">Video 1</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8z-SHZjKBY">Video 2</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRCz0Ml9XfU">Video 3</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZn50Wdfwk8">Video 4</a><br/></li>
</ul>

<hr/>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<hr/>

<p>1) There is high confidence a massive bot network is fueling ad revenue for many ELSAGATE content producers. Are these people trying to account for income they can&#39;t report?? </p>

<p>2) Videos are a perfect landing page or gathering point to distribute encoded messages about more nefarious stuff.  </p>

<p>3) Encoded messages to the nefarious stuff may be hidden in gibberish comments or unusual videos.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is an old comment, but don&#39;t you think one explanation for the gibberish comments is that children are watching the videos, and therefore occasionally typing gibberish in the comments section? So even if maybe an adult usually uses the account, the kid&#39;s probably the one making the gibberish comments. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>both would get attention because the mainstream connection is they&#39;re using popular disney/marvel characters in the videos to brainwash kids, that is the sort of thing people will get in an uproar over even when it isn&#39;t justified. In this case the stuff is visible right there plain as day, so it&#39;s not even a conspiracy.</p>
