        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>My first post here, I read the rulles and I hope to be as clear as possible.</p>

<p>I looked into conpiracy theories my entire life. I was looking for the truth. I started with the usual stuff like: MK ultra, 911, Kenedy assassination etc. Then I got deeper in like: freemasonery, how the elites are using black magick and satanism, what organised religions are, shadow govermant. I was lost in that without any direction.</p>

<p>Than i find this guy on youtube called Jewrassic Liars. I don&#39;t agree with him 100 percent, but is the closest from truth from what I could find. He exposes that the world is staged, the jews and other groups that do it, how they use subliminal messeges to fry your brain and all that good stuff. You can check it out if you want. </p>

<p>Lets explain more in depth: the jews with other satanic groups like freemasons, jesuits etc. and the gay people run the world. They use TV, newspappers, internet and all media to stage the world and fool all people. All you see on news like: car crush in Los Angeles, murther in New York, terrorist atacks are fake, everything. They use paid actors and criminals ( they get them out of jail quiker or they get something inside) to act in this hoaxes. They do that so people have no idea about what is really going on and also to implant subliminal messages into the brain of the people. The messages are: man and son ( the main ones, reffering to Jesus Christ), ram ( reffering to satan), elm elh elo ( abbreviations for elohim) and also lots of sexual inuendos ( especialy gay ones), at least this are the main ones. They use this mainely on the fake name they give to people, places where they say the hoaxes are happening. Let me give you some examples: KhuRAM Butt the terrorist (actor) in London ( ram and sexual like ram the butt). Other example: that creature Chelsea Manning ( el for elohim and man in manning), or that other witsle blower Julian Assange ( JewLie ASSange). And this thing are put everywhere to make you think about the ass or dick or sex. You have for exemple: ASSteroids, ASStonauts and of course the planet Uranus (YourAnus). I tell yo this things are put there and they are killing all of us. This people are sick, they are the spawns of Satan. God bless you all!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Didn&#39;t know so many groups could be controlling the world. It&#39;s pretty clear you&#39;re a bit extreme in terms of religion. Also what bad things has satan done? Far fewer than god</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Satan has done nothing because Satan is not real. It&#39;s a combination   of other gods, pagan gods and all other entities like Lucifer, Azazel, Baphomet all thrown in the same category of Satan by all organise religions ( I said organised religion is bullshit in the post). Also, what you call god is from the old testament, who was written by Jews and some stories depict god as god, other depict deamons as god ( where He says to kill people etc.) and other are purely political ( jews are the chosen people, off course, they written the book). The only direct incounter with God in person is Jesus Christ ( Jesus is God) and he never said to kill people or to make bad things to everybody, in oposition to what the jews sat God said to them. That&#39;s why they don&#39;t accept Jesus as God. And that&#39;s why they are the worst force in the world today. God came here and told us what to do: don&#39;t be materialistc, help the ones in need and more importantly never throw a stone at a fellow, even if he sinned. But this demons want to ruin humanity and they do it with the jews. The jews want to rule the world ( they call everybody else goy) and demons want people to kill, rape, be violent. My point is what the Jews tell you about God is not god because God came here and what they did to him? They killed him on the cross. They were afraid of Jesus showing the world that they ware liers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fun fact, Jesus was a Jew. They most likely killed him because he was a huge pain, going around threatening the authority of the jewish elite </p>

<p>How many jews actually use Goy? I&#39;m pretty sure its mainly people shitposting on the internet </p>

<p>Read the Talmud to see for yourself. </p>

<p>The fact that there is no convincing evidence for you in a world fully controlled by jewish elites doesn&#39;t mean He doesn&#39;t exist. I personally take everything that the jews tell me and reverse it. I know that the opposite of what they say is true, they lie all the time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not antisemitic. Look at the definition of that word. The semite people are not only Jews, are all the people in that region, who spoke the Semitic language. I&#39;m not even against all jews. I&#39;m against the ones who are destoyng the middle east and all the world. So I&#39;m antisemitic because i denounce the ones who destroy semite people in the middle east, just because jews are special snowflakes. Programing at his best, man.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey brother. Peace. Just passing by to remind you that, as you believe only in evidence, that there&#39;s no evidence of the actual existence of this mythical figure called Jesus. The best ever figured by historians is a collection of several &#39;messiah&#39; figures and &#39;prophets&#39; of the era, coalesced into one persona.</p>

<p>Therefore, &#39;Jesus&#39; and &#39;fact&#39; on the same sentence gives too much credit to a fairy tales book that has nothing to present in terms of historical fact.</p>

<p>Again, peace!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is difficult to answer.  I think they are not actually Jews.  People call them Jews for convenience, but I think the evil people we are dealing with hijacked that religion.  </p>

<p>It is like I am sure Freemasonry used to be noble and honorable, but then it was hijacked by the Illuminati to facilitate their infiltration into government and positions of power.  </p>

<p>I think that Hitler made a mistake.  He went after the wrong people.  He should have gone after the bankers and their infrastructure.  Hitler had captures a Rothschild, but then ransomed him.  He should have kept him as leverage.  This tells me that Hitler did not have a full grasp on who his enemy really was.  </p>

<p>I visualize the Rothschilds as being pussy bankers who could not handle the thought of one of their own being hung by Hitler.   </p>

<p>Notice I said that the Elders of Zion <strong>seem</strong> to be too accurate to be a hoax.  I am aware of the controversy.<br/>
If the Elders of Zion are a hoax, then they are uncannily accurate, right?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your video in the other comment is interesting. Something that many people don&#39;t realise that the form of magic that this elites are practicing is necromancy (in secret, in all of that secret meetings). It&#39;s the most fucked up things: humman sacrifice, organs as ingrediants in portions, dried eyebolls for evoking demons and spirits. It&#39;s the most fucked up form of satanism. They think that by doing that they raise from the dead undeworld and become gods.</p>

<p>Lady Gaga was portraying Lucifer in the 2017 Super Bowl Halftime show.  The coin toss was done by George HW Bush and his wife.  They are Illuminati.  George HW Bush has been known to like to screw underage boys, and probably much worse, like you mention.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I too think that they have ramped up the blatant in-our-face demonic occult symbolism to the nth degree in the last several years. They&#39;re <em>barely</em> trying to hide it in anymore, and it is EVERYWHERE. Once you see, you cannot unsee.</p>

<p>I picked it partially because i knew that is what others would say, especially when i go into Biblical prophecy fulfillment that occurs <a href="http://www.unsealed.org/2017/01/the-revelation-12-sign-compendium.html">3 months from now</a> ...</p>

<p>I think the devil (whom all secret societes, all the elite, TPTB, etc leads to. Every single one) has ramped up his end-game and is playing the final pieces on the figurative chessboard.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess they think they are right, or they think that it does not matter if they do evil.  I have been pondering this question recently.  </p>

<p>If the Luciferians/Satanists ritually sacrifice children, drink their blood, eat the pineal gland, or whatever it is they do, they they could believe it is evil and believe that it does not matter.  </p>

<p>I am not trying to be argumentative with you, but I am throwing this out there for people to think about.  </p>

<p>They could be psychopaths, too, so something is only evil if it harms them, everyone else be damned.  Maybe that is how psychopaths think.  </p>
