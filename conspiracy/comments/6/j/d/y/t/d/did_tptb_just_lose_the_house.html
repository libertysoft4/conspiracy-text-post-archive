<p>In a joint statement on Thursday, Berlin and Vienna said the amendment heralded a “new and very negative quality in European-American relations”.
The Senate move threatens to break a delicate transatlantic consensus on Russia sanctions orchestrated by Chancellor Angela Merkel, which has until now excluded Russia’s export pipelines partly because they involved key German interests. </p>

<p>So much that Germany threaten to retaliate if the sanctions are passed.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Why exactly don&#39;t we want the sanctions that the Senate almost unanimously supports against Russia, as Russia invaded, annexed land in, started and escalated a civil war in Europe?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The media has misrepresented what went down in Ukraine, who plotted it, who instigated it, and why. </p>

<p>It wasn&#39;t a &quot;civil war&quot;, it was a coup planned and instigated by the US and other Western spook agencies. We know this because a conversation between Victorian Nuland, Spokesperson for the United States Department of State, and U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, Geoffrey Pyatt was recorded and leaked to the press. </p>

<p>In the conversation, they discussed WHO was going to be in charge AFTER the coup - and the conversation took place ~January 28, 2013 -  <strong><em>fully three weeks before</em></strong> the &quot;demonstrations&quot; erupted that would eventually lead to the ousting of the democratically elected government and the installation of Western-backed stooges.</p>

<p><em>Please note that the following BBC article was PUBLISHED 11 days BEFORE the &quot;demonstrations&quot; erupted:</em></p>

<p><a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-26079957">Ukraine crisis: Transcript of leaked Nuland-Pyatt call</a> - 7 February 2014</p>

<p>Again, the entire event was instigated by agents of the US, EU nations and the MOSSAD - and though there were many motives, one of the plotters primary goals was to force Putin to ignore SYRIA by keeping him busy dealing with the Ukraine/ Crimea crisis.</p>

<p>Further research:</p>

<p>That&#39;s just a taste to give you an idea of the characters who have been the architects of the drama that has unfolded in in the Middle East, North Africa and in Ukraine over the past 20 years.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In a joint statement on Thursday, Berlin and Vienna said the amendment heralded a “new and very negative quality in European-American relations”.
The Senate move threatens to break a delicate transatlantic consensus on Russia sanctions orchestrated by Chancellor Angela Merkel, which has until now excluded Russia’s export pipelines partly because they involved key German interests. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So much that Germany threaten to retaliate if the sanctions are passed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And before &quot;why do you want to start WW3&quot; as the expected response, please realize that sanctions are meaning you can&#39;t do business with certain people and industries, it isn&#39;t a war.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>By targeting certain industries, like banking for example or keeping the price of oil low to punish a primary oil exporter, it is regular people who suffer.  </p>

<p>Why exactly don&#39;t we want the sanctions that the Senate almost unanimously supports against Russia, as Russia invaded, annexed land in, started and escalated a civil war in Europe?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The media has misrepresented what went down in Ukraine, who plotted it, who instigated it, and why. </p>

<p>It wasn&#39;t a &quot;civil war&quot;, it was a coup planned and instigated by the US and other Western spook agencies. We know this because a conversation between Victorian Nuland, Spokesperson for the United States Department of State, and U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, Geoffrey Pyatt was recorded and leaked to the press. </p>

<p>In the conversation, they discussed WHO was going to be in charge AFTER the coup - and the conversation took place ~January 28, 2013 -  <strong><em>fully three weeks before</em></strong> the &quot;demonstrations&quot; erupted that would eventually lead to the ousting of the democratically elected government and the installation of Western-backed stooges.</p>

<p><em>Please note that the following BBC article was PUBLISHED 11 days BEFORE the &quot;demonstrations&quot; erupted:</em></p>

<p><a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-26079957">Ukraine crisis: Transcript of leaked Nuland-Pyatt call</a> - 7 February 2014</p>

<p>Again, the entire event was instigated by agents of the US, EU nations and the MOSSAD - and though there were many motives, one of the plotters primary goals was to force Putin to ignore SYRIA by keeping him busy dealing with the Ukraine/ Crimea crisis.</p>

<p>That&#39;s just a taste to give you an idea of the characters who have been the architects of the drama that has unfolded in in the Middle East, North Africa and in Ukraine over the past 20 years.</p>

<p>But the referendum DID happen. The people voted, Russia enforced the vote where the government of Ukraine refused to.</p>
