    <div class="md"><p>The internet (as well as increased technological proficiency in youth) has allowed environments to exist that support transgenders and enforce the idea. Im sure the number itself isn&#39;t increasing significantly, but the number of people who feel comfortable in identifying themselves that way publicly definitely has. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not trying to say that I believe transgenderism is manufactured, but places like Tumblr for example are very quick to accept and support people who either identify or show traits of possibly being transgender. There was a good post on the front page in this sub about this the other day</p>

<p>Up until a few years ago, the additives in our plastics, particularly the plastic that lining our tin cans like soup, beans, pasta ect. contained a chemical that no, lie, in testing, turned the male frogs female. So there&#39;s that.</p>

<ol>

    <div class="md"><p>If it gets through and isn&#39;t filtered out of the water properly, that means that all animals and humans will be getting contaminated from these hormones. Just need to see the connection to males eating too many eggs and developing breasts to see that female hormones do affect males in high concentration. Who knows what happens at a lower concentration but it is happening and I suppose we&#39;ll find out in a couple of generations how severe it is. Feminised males = reduced population.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You think democracy in Britain is fine the way it is, power with the population... Yawn.</p>

<p>Hormones play a bigger role in sex / gender that what you are making out. Testestorone comes from the testes. You know, the sexual organ. Hormones are directly linked to gender so no matter if it is intentional or unintentional that hormones are in the body, it&#39;s still going to cause transgenderism due to having an abundance of the opposite sex&#39;s hormones. Wither the person thinks one way or another is irrelevant, the hormones will be taking affect.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>During our last conversation, you agreed it was a good system... Funny that you&#39;ve changed your tune since then... </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Women synthesize most of their estrogen in their ovaries and other reproductive tissues. Since men lack this female anatomy, they need to produce estrogen through a process involving an enzyme called aromatase that transforms testosterone into estradiol.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Mem don&#39;t have or produce estrogen. How long as the pill been a viable contraception? There &#39;could&#39; be an upsurge in transgenderism since there is more women taking the pill since men are taking in hormones that they do not have.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not the one that&#39;s lying here. I even said to you about if the world was governed the way the UK is, China would have the control of the world but you still thought the UK was a good democratic system lol</p>

<p>I&#39;m no scientist so I&#39;m speculating although there does seem to be reports out there suggesting the same thing. Who knows what would happen with an abundance of estrogen in women. Even more reactive? lol Turn them gay / bisexual? Who knows, just postulating, but it is a worry having hormones not being filtrated out the water systems.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I get the impression that at least some transgenders, especially those who search for praise and attention consider themselves such based on preexisting gender stereotypes. Let&#39;s say you get born with a male body but your life experience teaches you that you do not fit into the classic manly expectation of character. Somehow these people conclude that therefore they can&#39;t be true men. The correct assumption would be that the existing stereotypes are stupid.</p>

<p>On expects a &quot;true&quot; man to be hard, he does not cry, he takes charge, etc. But few men are naturally like that, many just act like they are because their minds are enslaved. From childhood they learned that this is how a real man acts and try to imitate it. In this case the transgender identity would be an attempt to resist the mental slavery, but while the intent might be pure, the method is not.</p>

<p>Doing so does nothing to abolish stereotypical thinking. The contrary is true. If all &quot;unmanly&quot; men started to consider themselves women it would pressure other unmanly men to denounce their menhood, thereby enforcing the stereotypes. Men who do not fit the stereotype should not renounce their malehood, they should accept it in a effort to be the living embodyment of the truth that preexisting stereotypes are stupid.</p>

<p>I try to be peaceful and honest and those are the attributes I use to judge others. A peaceful and honest woman has more in common with me than a violent and dishonest man. A peaceful and honest muslim has more in common with me than a violent christian. A honest black guy has more in common with me than a dishonest white guy. An honest child or an honest senior is more similar to me than a dishonest millenial. I prefer honest an dwarf over honest people of normal height, honest fat people over dishonest thin people. Honest ugly people over dishonest beauties. There a rich and poor people who are honest and middle classers who are not.</p>

<p>Honesty, Truth, Virtue and the desire for peace are most important in me and everyone who shares these beliefs from a position of understanding and 100% voluntarily is a person I would consider my kind, no matter their lot in the gene lottery.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are a lot of things that could contribute to this. </p>

<p>But I&#39;ll will focus on the political/ideological side of the question.</p>

<p>Marxism teaches that the family is the base of the capitalist structure. </p>

<p>So, as logical conclusion, if you destroy the base, the whole structure falls.  </p>

<p>Thus, during the propaganda phase of the implementation of the regime, all things that could lead to the decay of the family unity, are to be nourished. Anything that can be used to harm and/or deconstruct the family, will be used as tool to dismantle the System.</p>

<p>In this specific case, the whole rise of the transgenderism is being weaponized by politics.</p>

<p>We are almost reaching a point where everything is considered family. And guess what: If everything is purple, nothing is purple, because how can you tell something is purple without the contrast of yellow, for example.</p>

<p>Did you see the Batman: Lego film? In the closing credits they chant &quot;friends are family&quot;. That&#39;s how deep it goes..it&#39;s everywhere..</p>
