<p>The post was fine. But in his first comment, he talked about dating a bronze knife from carbon inclusions, then from traces left by wooden tools when it was being made. </p>

<p>The first may just about be theoretically possible, but certainly not in the casual &#39;send it off to the lab&#39; way he described. (And the only reason I even call it just about theoretically possible is that someone else linked to a technique for dating iron from inclusions, which is so unusual neither I or the archaeologist commenting on that thread had ever heard of it.)</p>

<p>The second is just not possible. Nobody who&#39;s an academic archaeologist would say or think that. </p>

<p>There were a few other details that didn&#39;t sit quite right, but it was a LARP alright. He deleted his account as soon as the going got tough on the carbon dating question. Says it all. </p>

<p>The story also fits in a little too well with the more general tribalistic/anti-multiculturalist/verging-on-white-supremacist leanings within the conspiracy community by positing that America was actually populated by indigenous caucasians who were (by implication) slaughtered by invading Native Americans... thus justifying white European genocide of those populations in turn.</p>

The problem is, in the scientific community especially, that supporting evidence means absolutely nothing, and they will dismiss your claim anyway if it means that MANY others have been wrong about everything all these years (like the timeline of human evolution, for example).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Introduction</p>

<p>I know that the title sounds a bit clickbait-y, but it&#39;s the best title I could think of. These past days I have witnessed what I believe are gross violations of both scientific ethics and ethics in general. I want to make these crimes known, and I think I have found a way to do that. Firstly, I&#39;d like to preface this by emphasizing that I have not slept very much lately, and not really any sleep at all these past couple nights. I want to apologize if anything I says seems incoherent or otherwise seems weird. Please, feel free to ask me about anything that seems off to you, and I&#39;ll try to clear things up the best I can. A lot of this is sort of stream of consciousness type stuff that&#39;s been rattling in my head, I don&#39;t even know where to start.</p>

<p>In the interest of protecting myself and my family, as I do genuinely fear retribution for what I am about to reveal, I will avoid saying things that could compromise my identity or the identity of my colleagues, even if I do genuinely believe some of them have been complicit or outright supportive of the crimes that have gone on here. I would like to think that I&#39;ve thought this through the best I can, given the circumstances. Eventually, I want to make my identity known, but only when I can guarantee the safety of myself and those I care about. I intend to find asylum somewhere, possibly in the USA or elsewhere.</p>

<p>Now, you&#39;re probably on the edge of your seat by now, wondering what the big deal is about. Let&#39;s get to it then. I may purposefully be vague about certain parts for the sake of time, for the sake of efficiency, and because I want to have some leverage throughout this entire debacle. I want this to spread as far as possible, and I don&#39;t want to just be disappeared. I need this to be spread as far as possible, I want these crimes to be known.
The Site</p>

<p>As I have mentioned before, I am a graduate student studying archaeology at the University of Calgary. I have done a lot of work along with other students working in the field, getting my hands dirty, that sort of thing. I really do enjoy archaeology, it&#39;s my greatest passion in life, and even after this is all over, I still want to continue my education in that field. However, because I have such a respect for science and for ethics, I can not, and I will not tolerate the flagrant suppression of real science that I&#39;ve experienced, and that I believe has occurred on a much larger scale.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s start at the beginning of where it all happened. In Entiako Provincial Park, over a year ago, a small group of archaeologists going over the area with Ground penetrating radar (GPR). They detected the walls of a longhouse and tumili (a kind of burial mound) approximately 1.8 meters underground. Multiple hollow chambers with contents that were yet unknown at the time were also detected. Naturally, the University of Calgary&#39;s Department of Anthropology and Archaeology got involved, including me, with the permission of the gracious provincial government, of course. I don&#39;t think they thought we were going to find what we did.</p>

<p>Over a year ago may seem a long time, but keep in mind that so much dirt is not easy to clear. Even with dozens of students and supervising staff busily working over the course of months clearing out the area into a large patch, digging with shovels, scraping away with trowels, trundling excavated dirty away, filtering earth to make sure nothing is missed, pegging out twigs with twine and metal stakes into one meter grid pattern, and the weather gets in the way, it&#39;s really a lot of work.</p>

<p>Anyway, as of now, we have excavated about 2.5 meters down, we’re into the very late Pleistocene era, but the middle strata is definitely from the Neolithic time period. What we&#39;ve found so far includes hand tools as well as a number of the distinctive flat, thin, leaf-shaped Solutrean-style spearpoints, arrowheads, and blades in the level one strata. Of course, we got them carbon dated by the UC&#39;s very own Department of Chemistry. The strata that has been excavated so far has been dated to approximately 9,800 radiocarbon years of age, roughly 11,000 calendar years.</p>

<p>This, on its own would be a very significant find. Something that would demand exposure, and I hoped that it would gain some exposure as I was very proud by this find, and so were other students who worked at the site. However, the department around this time began to engage in sketchy behavior that went against common protocol in these situations that made me suspicious. It was like they were trying to draw attention from the Entiako site. That is not the most dramatic thing that we found. This is where things get really interesting.</p>

<p>The skulls of the site&#39;s former occupants were also excavated down at Level 1, about the very end of the Paleolithic era. The frontal plumb of these skulls was straight, with small brow ridges, tall foreheads, and prominent chins. Both computerized and clay facial reconstruction of the skulls showed men and women with long faces, deepset eyes, aquiline noses, thin lips, and straight hair. What residual DNA testing we were able to get revealed that their hair was likely either blonde or red in color. Additional testing on residual mitochondrial DNA revealed that their mitochondrial group was Haplogroup N.</p>

<p>In other words, these were Cro-Magnon remains, the only remains ever discovered in North America, or the only ones that I know about, since I suspect that this is not the only coverup. They are ancient Caucasians, and of course that is very very politically incorrect with the narrative that I have come to believe that the Canadian government and others have been pushing in the West for such a long time.</p>

<p>I&#39;m going to assume you&#39;re familiar with the Solutrean hypothesis, a very controversial archaeological theory, for the sake of time I won&#39;t go too much into it. This site had supplementary evidence that this hypothesis may in fact be true, which is a very politically incorrect fact indeed. It is for that reason that I think the DA&amp;A and the Canadian government had motive to suppress the nature of what we found on this site.</p>

<p>Anyway, speaking of the site, what I personally think is that we&#39;ve mostly uncovered is basically a village area. We’ve found postholes and petrified wood slivers from a stockade of almost three acres that surrounded the site at one time, but the ruins are all centered within that area, so there were probably gardens and small grazing plots for livestock surrounding the structures, if they’d gotten around to domesticating animals in those days, which we’re not sure of. We’ve found skeletal remains of dogs, not wolves, which may have been domesticated by then, and we’ve found the bones of pigs and turkeys and pigeons, but there’s no way to tell if they were domesticated or if they were hunted in the wild.</p>

<p>There’s the longhouse and about eight other smaller buildings we’ve been working on, but some of the other structures were probably barns, workshops, granaries, and other storage facilities. Most of the people themselves probably lived in the longhouse. Of course, the site was inhabited on and off over the course of thousands of years. We figure that the area must have been quite a bit deeper back then, so it was a source of water that kept people coming back to settle in the area. There are multiple artifact bearing strata at the site which supports this.</p>

<p>I digress, anyway, what we&#39;ve uncovered here is game changing, it really is. Not only have we found Cro-Magnon style tumili, but the actual skulls of Cro-Magnon persons is even more of a discovery. However, the ensuing events destroyed my faith in archaeology in Canada and have brought to light many things that I believe have to be changed, that have to be acknowledged.
The Cover-up</p>

<p>Usually what would happen with such a big discovery such as this one is that an Eminent Persons Group would be sent, something like that. The world should know about what we found here. However, that simply has just not happened. I&#39;m going to try to keep this is as short as possible since you&#39;ve already had to sit through enough of my ranting and raving as it is. I am also really eager to get this all off of my chest.</p>

<p>The main thing, the most important thing that you understand is that they covered it up, what I have seen in the way of the most blatant and violent disregard for scientific protocol and ethics shocks me to my core, it makes me the angriest I&#39;ve ever truly been, I&#39;d say. That is the most important thing I can impart on to you, there was an intentional effort to stop what we found here from going public. I, and other colleagues at many points were ordered to disregard protocol, to destroy documentation, and to turn a blind eye to what was right under our noses.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The question they&#39;re going to ask me is, &quot;Why didn&#39;t you go through the proper channels?&quot; I can say with 100% confidence that I, and others did go through the proper channels. Throughout this entire situation, on multiple occasions I approached supervising staff, including the Head of the Department, who was overseeing the Entiako site, about my concerns. I was told that I was being, &quot;Insubordinate&quot; and/or, &quot;Out of line&quot; on many occasions there was the implicit threat of reprisal and the destruction of my career as an archaeologist.</p>

<p>It makes me boiling inside just to type this all out. In my anger, I decided that the only thing to do was to try to document what was going on myself, including documenting the various things that we found and the data that we collected on them. I did not do this without help, and it pains me that my acknowledging their names, I could be putting their lives, and the lives of who they care about in danger.</p>

<p>Sadly, I was not able to really any of the physical artifacts themselves due to a variety of circumstances. To my ever growing shock and something that makes me sick to my stomach, the destruction of these artifacts was covertly ordered by the federal administration of Canada. I know that this a bold claim, and I plan to prove it, all in good time.</p>

<p>Anyone who is familiar with Canadian politics, and the larger world of the West will know why they&#39;d want to suppress something like this. Science has been greatly infected by political correctness, especially in Anthropology and Archaeology for the sake of not offending anyone&#39;s sensibilities. It is something that&#39;s bugged me for a while, and it&#39;s always been something I&#39;ve been against. The truth is the truth.</p>

<p>Do you remember what I said about leverage earlier? This is what I was talking about. I have set up a dead man&#39;s switch, and in the event of my kidnapping, assassination, or otherwise suppression, a sizable leak of all the things that have occurred at the Entiako site. It will go out to many journalists and other pertinent people worldwide who I can rely to spread it as far as possible. That is my leverage until I can guarantee my safety and the safety of my loved ones.</p>

<p>It may seem extreme to some of you, but it is in my sincere belief that it is necessary. I do eventually want to make this entire data dump open to the public, all in good time. I have planned this out over the past couple weeks in great detail, this is how I&#39;m going to do things.
The Conclusion</p>

<p>I really would like to include so much more, but for the purposes of efficiency and brevity, this is a relatively short summary. Believe me, this is not the end, a lot more information is going to be coming your way, the entire public&#39;s way hopefully. This is basically what has gone on. I need this to be known, I need this to be spread. Don&#39;t let this be buried, let the truth be known.</p>

<p>I would like to emphasize, that I do not blame all of the participants in Entiako, as I mentioned before, many of them actively did their best to dissent against the highly unethical things that were going on. Some of them chose to keep their mouths shut and they just did what they were told, no matter how abhorrent. I forgive them as to make mistakes is only human. However, the facts need to come to light eventually.</p>

<p>My main request to you is to spread this around to everyone you know, do it on other social media sites, don&#39;t stop talking about it. Let the truth be known. This is not goodbye, additional proof and information will be provided. I have a process for this whole thing, and it will come to fruition if I have anything to say about it.</p>

<p>If the media wants to give me a name, call me Mx. Entiako.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t think the origional post had racist undertones at all. He seemed more mad about the fact that his work was being suppressed and it had major implications for human history. But then again, calling something racist as a means to discredit it seems to be a popular strategy nowadays. </p>

<p>OP did respond to the carbon dating question that was raised, the response seemed legitimate.  The response is not included in the archive unfortunately.  </p>

<p>The allegations of carbon dating ignorance are sketchy.<br/>
The allegations of racism are <em>extremely</em>, <em>extremely</em> suspicious</p>
