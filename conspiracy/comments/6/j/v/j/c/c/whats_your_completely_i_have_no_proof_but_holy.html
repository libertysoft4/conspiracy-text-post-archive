        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Tin foil hat time! But if any of you folks wanna take this and run with it, be my guest. I am pretty sure there are those out there better at this than me.</p>

<p>Mine is having to do with the sudden rise of fourth wave feminism on the internet. This whole thing about angry friend zoned guys and fervent pushing of the idea of &quot;rape culture&quot; on college campuses seems suspicious to me. <strong>I think it was something that was pushed by CIA operatives because they did the same shit with Gloria Steinem back in the 60s and 70s, taking the Feminist movement and corrupting it to serve the plutocrats:</strong> <a href="http://www.harrietfraad.com/writings/the-feminist-movement-what-happened-and-why.html">http://www.harrietfraad.com/writings/the-feminist-movement-what-happened-and-why.html</a> </p>

<p><strong>They made the younger generation&#39;s new political awareness and made it into a bougie, non-threatening-to-the-plutocrats movement. It was also when income inequality and America&#39;s economic decline started to happen.</strong></p>

<p>Why am I flinging my pretty accusations? Because the same thing seemed to happen with the occupy movement around the early 2010s. I realize that this sub has <em>tons</em> of diversity of political opinion, but this is just my baseless accusation so take it with a grain of salt. </p>

<p>There was this sudden shift out of nowhere, immediately after the occupy movement - where everything was rape (paranoia over Robin Thicke), &quot;nice guys&quot; were the ultimate evil in the world (that shit SCREAMED upper-class privilege to me), and it ultimately jumped the shark with Anita Sarkeesian and that &quot;5 guys&quot; fat girl. <strong>They infested the internet, going after easy targets like nerd culture or other things of the like, distracting people from more serious issues that more than likely would have gotten more oxygen and discussion had this distraction not been set up.</strong> Enough people bought the bullshit, started pushing the lie themselves, and it bought the plutocrats more time until the rise of Trump and Sanders in 2016. </p>

<p>I also think that (and this is a <em>really</em> huge stretch) that they were priming the youth vote to get excited for Hillary in 2016. I know for a fact that <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/article/2485252/social-media/are-online-comments-full-of-paid-lies-.html">fake comments are a longstanding internet tradition at this point.</a> </p>

<p>...Then it seemed to kinda run its course a little before the 2016 election hit. Not sure why, but all the attention seemed directed elsewhere. Normally I&#39;d chalk it up to the election but with the first female candidate on a major ticket, you&#39;d think it&#39;d be a stronger presence than ever. </p>

<p>These petty distractions over identity politics seem to happen every time that the powers that be are trying desperately to make really scummy moves. I can&#39;t prove it by any stretch of the imagination, but holy crap I&#39;m so sure it&#39;s true.</p>

<p><strong>tl;dr: TPTB used identity politics to distract from economic equality and promote the Hilldawg in recent years. I absolutely, positively, have zero proof of this, though.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ahh, sure, let me copy paste from a while ago.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Well i mean.. it&#39;s the perfect storm of monster stories, right? We&#39;d been drinking earlier, we were on a tiny island, alone, no other witnesses, it was dark, and it was also foggy - just to make sure that we had absolutely 0% credibility when we told other people.</p>

<p>We walked out onto the beach area, and it was &#39;sitting/floating&#39; in the water, kinda the way a duck does, when it either saw or heard us then it went straight under water and took off. We saw the outline of it and it was enough to stop us both in our tracks with a &#39;cold blood&#39; moment. When it went under it was loud, displacing a lot of water. Probably the size of a car, i&#39;d say. The water was perfectly still before and this thing made waves come to the shore.
I don&#39;t know wtf it was, but it was big and it moved fast. It wasn&#39;t a fish, it wasn&#39;t a duck.. it wasn&#39;t any of the other 500 things people have told me it was. It was alive, it was chilling out by itself, we spooked it and it bolted.</p>

<p>My friend told his sister (who was wheelchair bound and handicapped) the story, and the next day she comes up to us, hands us something like <a href="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/e8/5d/20/e85d20cf2d9f27e2157556f5e929d5ee--sock-puppets-hand-puppets.jpg">this</a>, says &quot;hey guys i found your monster&quot;, then turns around and wheels away laughing. Never been served so hard in my life.</p>

<p>&quot;In the 1960&#39;s, the elite media invented second-wave feminism as part of the elite agenda to dismantle civilization and create a New World Order.&quot; <a href="https://www.henrymakow.com/180302.html">https://www.henrymakow.com/180302.html</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Personally, I believe the &quot;fat acceptance&quot; and &quot;healthy at every size&quot; movements are forms of population and social/political control. Being overweight shortens your lifespan, period. The shorter youre alive, the less resources you use, and the less time you bave on earth to make a difference in society. Further, being overweight also means your body uses more energy to simply stay alive, leaving you with much less energy to do things like protest or start movements that would make real change. <em>takes off tin foil hat</em> </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. There is absolutely no reason to pick on people who are overweight; i&#39;ve been overweight and picking on me isn&#39;t what motivated me to get in shape. What did motivate me is realizing that if I continued down this path, I&#39;d likely be dead before I could make any change or difference in the world. Plus, bullying people only adds to the hate and divisiveness and negative energy that TPTB want- being mean to our fellow mam is literally going to be what ends our society as we know it. We should have an understanding acceptance coupled with education and positive reinforcement- when an overweight friend expresses displeasure in themselves or their experience, turn that displeasure into a learning opportinity, remind them that you want them to live as long as possible, and that you&#39;re here for them every step of the way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The vast majority of news is scripted, as in it didn&#39;t happen or it happened according to another higher up script. Like the speeches elected officials give are coordinated by an interconnected cadre of writers.  Within this group, partisanship doesn&#39;t happen. They&#39;re just writing a show and the goal is to distract and control us.  Factually, most of the news is copy-paste slighy rewrite from Reuters/AP who copy paste various governments, so I don&#39;t think this is a stretch, just a subtle twist on the reality we&#39;re told.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Shampoos and deodorants actually keep you &quot;dirty&quot; or smelling bad so you continue to use their products and put harsh chemicals onto your body, like aluminum.</p>

<p>There&#39;s videos of girls who stop using shampoo and after a month, their hair has adjusted to not needing it anymore and stays clean on its own with just water. I personally stopped using deodorant and while the first week i didnt smell so pleasant, i no longer need it and never smell.</p>

<p>I know, it&#39;s kind of a silly theory, but just a personal thing I&#39;ve observed. </p>

<p>I mean I&#39;ve pulled it off accidentally and ended up keeping my arms clenched by my sides the last few hours, but I get the feeling it&#39;d be a pretty tough experiment, for everyone.  </p>
