<p>There are 3 types of people here, conspiracy theorists, paid shills and parrots. Parrots are people who make comments on subjects they know little to nothing about and only repeat the official stories fed to them. A person who makes an idiotic circular comment like &quot;jet fuel can&#39;t melt steel beams&quot; are parrots, ignore them.</p>

<p>These people are the reasons sheeple is an insult to sheep, in the words of David Icke &quot;sheep need a dog to herd them, people herd each other&quot; and that&#39;s what these parrots do. They want to come across as intelligent and the way idiots achieve this is by repeating the words of the people they deem to be intelligent or more to the point, the people they have been told to listen to.</p>

<p>School teaches us to copy and repeat in this very same way, it&#39;s beaten into us to be this way. So how do we solve the problem?</p>

<p>Make then explain, not with links or sources, ask them questions. If they respond angrily then bingo, parrot. parrots hate being held to the flames because they only know what MSM has told them. These people are worse then paid shills. </p>

<p>But to find them you have to ask yourself before commenting &quot;do I actually know what I&#39;m saying?&quot;</p>

<p>Peace and love</p>

<p>He actually goes into more detail further down in the comment:</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>While it&#39;s a bit extreme, I agree with the general idea of what he&#39;s saying. If somebody can&#39;t actually explain their thought process/reasoning behind a certain stance (that happens to be a popular one), then they <em>are</em> a parrot. This applies in all topics in life.</p>

<p>I really don&#39;t think it&#39;s fair that you have replied to this post in this way. You&#39;re putting words in his mouth. Lots of people jump straight to the comments when they open such threads and you seem to be trying to derail this one with a bit of a strawman reply, in all honesty. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>by limiting the avenues which you can pursue to provide proof, you&#39;re intentionally trying to curtail the fact-based truth from coming out. providing links or sources is a GOOD thing, it means there&#39;s actual SCIENCE behind what you say. to try to stop empirical proof from coming to the fore is extremely anti-intellectual. maybe being PC and beating around the bush (by simply implying the OP is shallow instead of coming out and saying it) is the right way to go about things, but i can understand the frustration.</p>

<p>it definitely appears to me like what Rockran said is correct.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You seem to think it&#39;s a myth so I am asking how you have came to that conclusion. No sources. Just you and that brain of yours : )</p>

<p>I know for a fact that during every mass extinction event, the atmospheric conditions changed which resulted in an ice age. There is data world wide to &#39;prove&#39; that. </p>

<p>I want to know how you have came to your ridiculous speculation that man is not add excess chemicals into the atmosphere which will not push us towards climate change? Saying &#39;it can&#39;t be proven&#39; can be said for most, if not all conspiracies so that is a false statement (especially regarding humans output into the atmosphere and Earths history regarding the changes in atmospheric conditions concluding to an ice age.) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are asking me how I came to a speculation, that has boggled my mind. The answer is in the word speculate. I don&#39;t think anything about climate change, I just think we should do something about it regardless. So I don&#39;t understand what you are asking me.

    <div class="md"><p>Yes I want to know how you came to that conclusion. </p>

<p>What, do you just disbelieve everything or something along those lines? There must be a reason why you disbelieve that burning fossil fuels adds extra chemicals into the atmosphere which will push us towards climate change therefore next ice age will be sooner. </p>

<p>Nothing can be done to stop climate change. Trying to stop it could fuck up the planet big time. The Earth goes through cycles so it essentially needs to happen (who knows WTF would happen if the cycles didn&#39;t conclude.)</p>

I don&#39;t need an opinion on it. The point of my post is to question people when they make comments about certain topics they know nothing about. You made the comment on global warming so I asked you the questions, you didn&#39;t have any answers because you know nothing about it therefore proving the point of my post. So thanks :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And as I have repeated numerous times I have no opinion on it, but I think we shouldn&#39;t argue about it because it will help the planet and that&#39;s not a bad thing. I have said this since the beginning yet you can&#39;t seem to comprehend it. You seem to be making a lot of assumptions and none of them are correct. You keep saying I came to a conclusion, I&#39;d love to know what conclusion you think I have come to considering I have never stated anything of the like.

I&#39;ve not denied climate change, I merely stated there is no proof, you were unable to provide any evidence of any kind.

<p>Your OP says not to ask for sources so you are going against your own post lol</p>

<p>All I am doing is asking if you think humans affect the climate or not. Yes or no answer. Doesn&#39;t matter about proof or sources, I want your opinion since you are harassing me for sources to prove myself (when your OP says to ask questions, which you have failed to do but you went against your OP and started asking for sources to back myself up.)</p>

<p>There&#39;s plenty of evidence to show that global climate temperatures have risen dramatically over the past couple hundred years (since we started burning fossil fuels), far beyond the rates of the previous few millenia. </p>

<p>Are you suggesting that this data is wrong, or that it doesn&#39;t represent a continuing trend? </p>

<p>Many people also can&#39;t differentiate between opinion and facts.
That&#39;s something I find most frustrating. Like, here are the facts and the only response is, but it&#39;s just your opinion man. No, it&#39;s not. With different facts I&#39;d have a different opinion. Is that so hard to grasp? Guess it is, because most choose a side and stay on it till it crumbles and fall, no matter the facts. Like a fucking cult.</p>

<p>I like parroting, it has a more meaningful way for the analogy we&#39;re using it fro. Sheeps are way too fluffy and cute and can&#39;t harm anyone.</p>

<p>Define &#39;official&#39; stories. Are they the ones pushed by 4chan or random youtube videos? Or are they the ones pushed by the trump admins or congress? And what happens when our own research agrees with the &#39;official&#39; views?</p>

<p>Oh, I remember. When progressives/liberals started asking questions those ever loyal to the government conservatives called such people &#39;evil&#39;, traitors, etc.</p>

<p>But also don&#39;t be so quick to discard msm news. There is a hard propaganda push from the right to discredit anything and anyone who dares to criticize their master, trump. Be careful you don&#39;t simply jump on a bandwagon they are driving just because you find flaws in the press (which has always had them).</p>

<p>Too many now seem to rush off to find preachers who tell them what they want to hear, even if it is all or mostly lies (4chan, zerohedge, etc).</p>

<p>Judge all sources the same.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh don&#39;t worry, I recognise the bias from all sides. I don&#39;t disregard any media though. I acknowledge it, compare it to what other media outlets say, try to form the best idea of truth based on what resources I have at my disposal. There&#39;s pushes from both the hard right, hard left, neo-liberals, and every &quot;side&quot;, and that&#39;s because &quot;sides&quot; are controlled. There are no sides in the end. Just differing philosophies and ideologies. Politics should be about taking different aspects of these ideologies and applying them where most relevant to better the greater society. Problem is it&#39;s been hijacked and drilled into the minds of the people that politics is about choosing a box to put yourself in and pushing for only that forever. Politics don&#39;t account for the very nature of the universe - change. Practicing ideologies is problematic as ideologies don&#39;t plan for their own inevitable, eventual obsoletion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OP you have it all wrong. There are three types of people: dicks, pussies, and assholes. If you aren&#39;t a dick you&#39;re probably getting fucked.</p>

<p>Pussies don&#39;t like dicks because pussies get fucked by dicks. But dicks also fuck assholes. Assholes that just want to shit on everything. Pussies may think they can deal with assholes their way. But the only thing that can fuck a asshole is a dick, with some balls. The problem with dicks is they fuck too much or fuck when it isn&#39;t appropriate. And it takes a pussy to show them that. But sometimes pussies can be so full of shit that they become assholes themselves. Because pussies are a inch and half away from assholes. I don&#39;t know much about this crazy crazy world, but I do know this. If you don&#39;t let us fuck this asshole we&#39;re going to have our dicks and pussies all covered in shit.</p>
