        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I just stumbled upon a crazy theory while following Joseph Farrell.</p>

<p>Basically, the Nazis built nukes by 1944, and used them against Russia.  But, they didn&#39;t have good means to deliver them, and they wanted to save their bombs to use in Hydrogen bombs as triggers.  They flew a bomber sortie to New York within 20 miles.  But, their overall war effort fell apart, so the top generals and scientists cut deals with America (think Alan Dulles and the CIA), hoping to create a secret Nazi empire that fought in the background (think SPECTRE - these guys were behind the Muslim Brotherhood).</p>

<p>Anyway, here&#39;s my theory: The &quot;Manhattan Project&quot; was the NAZI project to build an H-bomb to destroy Manhattan.  America took it over and shuttled the bomb as quickly as possible to Japan for use there.</p>

<p>After the war, they &quot;declassified&quot; the Manhattan project and framed it as an American scientific effort complete with a fake history and test sites.  This was to cover up collusion with Nazi scientists after the war.</p>

<p>Everyone always says: &quot;the Manhattan project involved 30,000 people and they kept it secret.&quot;  Well, what if, &quot;the falsification of the Manhattan project involved thousands of people, but the world still believes it.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Compared with other nuclear events: The Chernobyl explosion put 400 times more radioactive material into the Earth&#39;s atmosphere than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima; atomic weapons tests conducted in the 1950s and 1960s all together are estimated to have put some 100 to 1,000 times more radioactive material into the atmosphere than the Chernobyl accident.&quot; :This article is written in page 8(9) of &quot;Ten years after Chernobyl:What do we really know? &quot;of the PDF official document.[4]</p>

<p>The radioactivity released at Chernobyl tended to be more long lived than that released by a bomb detonation hence it is not possible to draw a simple comparison between the two events. Also, a dose of radiation spread over many years (as is the case with Chernobyl) is much less harmful than the same dose received over a short period.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Chernobyl wasn&#39;t a nuclear blast, it was a failure of safety and containment protocols for a nuclear power plant. Radiation only mutates and damages cellular structures and DNA, often times mutations and damage is minor enough for organisms to survive to reproductive stages, which is all that&#39;s needed to survive, like in Chernobyl.</p>

<p>Nuclear bombs release superheated gas and shockwaves, severe enough to burn away anything organic, and pulverize whatever&#39;s left. </p>

<p>Surviving extreme radiation doses isn&#39;t so much a luck of a draw, as it is severity of exposure. Sure, you might be fine with a bit. But extreme exposure can lead to disturbing consequences, like <a href="http://wonderfulengineering.com/this-is-what-happens-when-human-body-is-exposed-to-radiation-graphic-content/">Hiroshi Ouchi, a victim of the Tokaimuri Nuclear Accident.</a> </p>

<p>Be careful though with this line of thinking though. There have been multiple times where I thought I was being rational in my immediate rejection of a proposed conspiracy theory, only to later find out that there was actually some merit to the argument. </p>

<p>Some things are so &quot;out there&quot; that even the most reasonable conspiracy theorist will laugh at without even giving the idea a chance. We must be vigilent in discerning the theories that sound batshit crazy on the surface, but have evidence to support it, and actually crazy theories that are either disinformation or just those in denial or looking for a conspiracy.</p>

<p>For example, this idea that nuclear bombs aren&#39;t real. Do I think that&#39;s true? Right away, my mind says &quot;that&#39;s bullshit&quot;. But do I cast it aside and deem anyone claiming this is crazy? Absolutely not. I&#39;ll first try to gain an understanding for why this person believes something ridiculous, and evaluate the theory based on the supporting evidence (even when it&#39;s circumstantial).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Chernobyl was not a nuclear blast. It was a meltdown. Lots of radiation but not a city leveling blast. And I think the shutting down of the city was really a cautionary precaution because they don&#39;t really know where all the radiation is and it&#39;s in hot spots you can be fine in one place and not so fine in another. But if they let anybody live there and somebody came down with any form of cancer the government would be liable. So rather than face that liability they just shut the whole damn place down.  Natural uranium is not particularly dangerous, even though it is radioactive. It has to be refined first to be really dangerous. That refining process is why every country in the world doesn&#39;t already have nuclear weapons. And as far as dying from it I think it&#39;s the luck of the draw. Just like you&#39;ll see some 90 year old man who smoked 2 packs of cigarettes every day for his entire adult life, you also see people dying of lung cancer in their 40s.  I do know from personal experience that radiation can definitely do some damage. I had bone cancer and got radiation therapy. Apparently it did kill the cancer, but it also fried my femoral head and now I have an artificial hip. </p>

Most of the people should be dead by now. So if you got a hold of the list of people working there you should be able to find death certificates for most. I really doubt that they would fake records for the marriages and children and deaths after the war. Or if they wanted to just wrap everything up have everybody conveniently died in car accidents would also be highly suspicious. But my point is that this is something that can be proven one way or the other. Just looking up a few at random and calling relatives would show up a fake pretty quickly. </p>

<p>The biggest thing is, those cities. Chernobyl is supposedly a nuclear wasteland, yet those cities are thriving. How? How can people live there after being bombed like that with nukes? Where is the fallout like Chernobyl? Where it&#39;s supposedly deserted. They kind of just looked like they were firebomb, yes.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Compared with other nuclear events: The Chernobyl explosion put 400 times more radioactive material into the Earth&#39;s atmosphere than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima; atomic weapons tests conducted in the 1950s and 1960s all together are estimated to have put some 100 to 1,000 times more radioactive material into the atmosphere than the Chernobyl accident.&quot; :This article is written in page 8(9) of &quot;Ten years after Chernobyl:What do we really know? &quot;of the PDF official document.[4]</p>

<p>The radioactivity released at Chernobyl tended to be more long lived than that released by a bomb detonation hence it is not possible to draw a simple comparison between the two events. Also, a dose of radiation spread over many years (as is the case with Chernobyl) is much less harmful than the same dose received over a short period.</p>

<p>The relative size of the Chernobyl release when compared with the release due to a hypothetical ground burst of a bomb similar to the Fat Man device dropped on Nagasaki.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As for that guy in the video, my guess is he&#39;s a charlatan. Much like the dozens of psychics/mediums/etc. of the early days in television. How do we know he&#39;s actually a nuclear physicist and that he&#39;s actually got radioactive chemicals on stage? Even if those <em>are</em> radioactive chemicals they wouldn&#39;t be immediately fatal from ingestion. </p>

<p>I also can&#39;t seem to find any legitimate info on this guy from some cursory google searches. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Chernobyl was not a nuclear blast. It was a meltdown. Lots of radiation but not a city leveling blast. And I think the shutting down of the city was really a cautionary precaution because they don&#39;t really know where all the radiation is and it&#39;s in hot spots you can be fine in one place and not so fine in another. But if they let anybody live there and somebody came down with any form of cancer the government would be liable. So rather than face that liability they just shut the whole damn place down.  Natural uranium is not particularly dangerous, even though it is radioactive. It has to be refined first to be really dangerous. That refining process is why every country in the world doesn&#39;t already have nuclear weapons. And as far as dying from it I think it&#39;s the luck of the draw. Just like you&#39;ll see some 90 year old man who smoked 2 packs of cigarettes every day for his entire adult life, you also see people dying of lung cancer in their 40s.  I do know from personal experience that radiation can definitely do some damage. I had bone cancer and got radiation therapy. Apparently it did kill the cancer, but it also fried my femoral head and now I have an artificial hip. </p>
