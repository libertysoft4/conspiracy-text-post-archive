<p>According to MS academia it is.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure there were death squads. I&#39;m not denying that possible genocide didn&#39;t happen. It was a fucked time in history. But, it was not officially from the top. </p>

<p>Also, it wasn&#39;t just Jews being killed, it was Slavs, Christians, Gypsies, homosexuals, etc etc. Jews should not have a monopoly on WWII.</p>

<p>This may be true, but if it is, it&#39;s because people are questioning it, so they have to keep re-framing it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why Sabbatean-Frankists rule not Rome:</p>

<ul>
<li>The money flows to Rothschild who are way more culty than Jesuity</li>
<li>All current political events easily traceable to Zionist Israel, presumably informed by this cult. What does Rome want in Syria vs. what does Israel want in Syria</li>
<li>Hard to imagine Zionists taking orders from Romans</li>
<li>Freemasonry infiltrated by the cult, as evidenced by their entire mythos being centered around Solomon&#39;s temple, one of the cult&#39;s focuses</li>
<li>1666 Weishaupt, Rothschild are united by Frank, who carries on the Sabbatean messianish Jewish cult. Perfect place to stop and analyze history without having to go back to BC, Egypt, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>Why <a href="/r/romerules">/r/romerules</a> is suspicious:</p>

<ul>
<li>Written by one dude</li>
<li>Refers you to his previous posts for information which are sometimes not super relevant</li>
<li>Likes to call people trolls and delete their posts</li>
<li>Very low explanation and discussion of: B&#39;nai B&#39;rith, Zionism, Israel, Greater Israel, Solomon&#39;s/Third Temple</li>
<li>Low interest by this community</li>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi man thanks for the reply that&#39;s interesting stuff. Much appreciated. </p>

<p>I will defend V_A (main Rome rules dude), the Jesuit theories and r/RomeRules:</p>

<p>It&#39;s mostly one guy posting but others do too. The number of posters in a reddit sub doesn&#39;t mean shit. For example the Donald has a lot and it&#39;s rubbish. There are thousands or more here yet a lot of bots shills and losers on this sub. Doesn&#39;t make it better (?)</p>

<p>There are a lot of trolls. Posts get deleted or chaned here too... I understand your point that he limits free speech is suspicious but no different to say te real world </p>

<p>He actually explains and sources the Jesuit control of Zionism pretty well IMHO</p>

<p>Lots of people are interested in aliens. I think aliens are fake and the amount Of interest doesn&#39;t add greater authority</p>

<p>I will look into the guys you talked about and the points you raise cheers </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I&#39;ve checked that out before. Rome vs. the Sabbatean-Frankists seem to be the final two conspiracy theories. Personally, I see more evidence for the Sabbatean-Frankists holding the power today which I can go into if you&#39;re interested.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why Sabbatean-Frankists rule not Rome:</p>

<ul>
<li>The money flows to Rothschild who are way more culty than Jesuity</li>
<li>All current political events easily traceable to Zionist Israel, presumably informed by this cult. What does Rome want in Syria vs. what does Israel want in Syria</li>
<li>Hard to imagine Zionists taking orders from Romans</li>
<li>Freemasonry infiltrated by the cult, as evidenced by their entire mythos being centered around Solomon&#39;s temple, one of the cult&#39;s focuses</li>
<li>1666 Weishaupt, Rothschild are united by Frank, who carries on the Sabbatean messianish Jewish cult. Perfect place to stop and analyze history without having to go back to BC, Egypt, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>Why <a href="/r/romerules">/r/romerules</a> is suspicious:</p>

<ul>
<li>Written by one dude</li>
<li>Refers you to his previous posts for information which are sometimes not super relevant</li>
<li>Likes to call people trolls and delete their posts</li>
<li>Very low explanation and discussion of: B&#39;nai B&#39;rith, Zionism, Israel, Greater Israel, Solomon&#39;s/Third Temple</li>
<li>Low interest by this community</li>
