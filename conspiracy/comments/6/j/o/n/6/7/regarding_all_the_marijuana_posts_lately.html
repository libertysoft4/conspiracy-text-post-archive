        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Okay, I was going to write a long ass post but erased it. I am going to go straight to the point.</p>

<p>This is a conspiracy in itself. The US government already knows it is going to legalize marijuana at some point. </p>

<p>They put out these articles regarding health benefits as a way to get us more attracted to the multi-billion dollar industry that is right around the corner.</p>

<p>Yes marijuana has health benefits, but that is regarding cannabinoids, not THC. So many articles have been coming out from all different universities propping up marijuana as the miracle plant and how legalization of the plant will solve many problems.</p>

<p>First off, the universities are compromised. Their studies and release of these articles are under supervision from the government. For example, the first article I ever read was from Harvard stating that marijuana can slow down cancer growth. </p>

<p>Harvard? One of the Ivy Leagues? They must have credibility. The Ivy League schools were funded through illegal CIA operations. The very schools that have secret societies. The very schools that have apparent authority and is revered as such. </p>

<p>This is an agenda. They used marijuana to place many people in jail. The CIA used marijuana to make a lot of money. They can make this money regardless if it is legal or not. Their next step is to legalize it. </p>

<p>The problem with marijuana is that it has become an addiction for many people. It saps people of ambition, clear thinking, develops paranoia, and makes us spiritually weak. Yes the plant can be helpful, but not in the way it has been marketed. </p>

<p>Marijuana THC levels have risen significantly over time. We are now extracting oils from it to get even more high. </p>

<p>This is not good in the long run.</p>

<p>The US government is preparing for legalization. It was not from the efforts of its citizens. </p>

<p>Yes there are countries in the world that has legalized it but it is in the US where it has been marketed heavily and memed into the minds of millions of youth.</p>

<p>We have to understand that whatever becomes popular, even within this sub, has to be taken with a grain of salt. I see pro-marijuana health benefit posts here everyday. I assure you that the front page of this subreddit has been compromised. </p>

<p>We are being duped. The US government already knows that the voices of conspiracy theorists are slowly gaining credibility. They know that people who once shunned us suddenly return saying, &quot;hey I think you might have been right about this.&quot; They are taking advantage of this.</p>

<p>I just want to end with saying that we have to understand that there is a lot of trickery afoot and just because we come to a group consensus about something, it does not make it necessarily the right path.</p>

<p>I am sure I will be downvoted but this is a message I hope reaches people who are willing to listen. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is ridiculous. Both THC-A, and THC have medicinal qualities. Where are you getting this stuff? </p>

<p>Are you asserting cannabis use can have negative side effects? If so, which ones specifically? Imho, what you are seeing is nothing more than a burgeoning industry born of grass roots activism and sacrifice. It&#39;s merely the power of human unification. That&#39;s not to say there isn&#39;t grave risk of losing the industry to a corporate takeover, there is, but at this moment in time, most of the proceeds from the industry are going directly into average Americans pockets. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I disagree, I can&#39;t really take your memory for evidence! It could have felt more potent to you since it was your youth and you may have not smoked as much before? There is plenty of evidence to show weed has gotten more potent with legalization and just down to breeding stronger plants. Look a Dabs. A totally different ball game. THC levels have risen quite alot but CBD content has stayed quite the same.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d counter that cross-breeding has always been a thing. Measuring THC content with number accurate methods has not.

    <div class="md"><p>You disagree based on inexperience and propaganda which has an anti marijuana agenda.  We used to get  the best world varieties and now we get almost exclusively  domestic. If you compare the crap domestic of yesteryear,  that  we called hay,  to today&#39;s  domestic then there has been improvement.</p>

<p>if you compare the  current  domestic to something like Thai Stick during the Viet Nam War, that often  lasted 24 hours and left you only capable of blithering during  that period,  there is no comparison.</p>

It just takes time and patience and most aren&#39;t willing to give that.

    <div class="md"><p>What? There is no GMO cannabis on the market. Yes, it&#39;s stronger, but potency is always relative to tolerance. I regularly smoke good cannabis, but I still don&#39;t get as high as I was when I was a kid smoking shitty Mexican brown weed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually this is a highly incorrect assumption. Farming techniques are not new, hydroponics isn&#39;t new. It&#39;s just more widespread. And as far as GMO based? What? You know nothing about the subject. </p>

<p>There might be some kind of GMO cannabis, but not that anyone is aware of except whoever&#39;s doing the modifying. You won&#39;t see that in places where you actually get it, or have it in legal shops. It&#39;s not efficient. THC increase is by cross breeding. And THC levels ARE NOT at a record high. It&#39;s just that higher potency strands are more widely available. Not too mention that even measuring THC is only newly widespread. There&#39;s nothing to measure against. These are all faux arguments.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I kinda get where you&#39;re coming from  Being a long time smoker myself I feel that strong THC plus mental health problems can cause problems such as laziness and complacency. Here in Ireland we smoke quite alot of strong weed since thats all we get. We smoke more than the Dutch per capita. I think if it was decriminalized like Amsterdam we could see usage of potent cannabis fall as their would be a variability in the market. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Objectively it is literally insane to keep this plant illegal, citizens going to jail for the possession of a flower is really starting to become an archaic practice and this is the reason people are pushing for full on legalization, not just medical. At this point most reasonable people can why this plant is being kept illegal and it&#39;s certainly not because of a public health concern. Alcohol ruins livers, cigarettes cause cancer, gambling can drive somebody to suicide and this is all legal. High THC content is no need to cause alarm, in the 60s-70s cannabis was really weak but now it&#39;s not because of the exquisite perfection of marijuana farmers over the years. High THC isn&#39;t dangerous, maybe just don&#39;t snake as much? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your post is littered with halve truths and falsehoods.   </p>

<p>As already pointed out THC is a cannabinoid.   </p>

<p>People who have addition problems will always find something to feed their addictive personality and I believe I have such a personality however as someone who has been married to Maryjane for a long time now I have never had a problem stopping for sustained periods. And neither have the large majority of smokers that I know. If marijuana is addictive, it is largely a safe addiction which countless reports already drops in Alcohol and Opioid abuse aswell as drops in crime across the board.   </p>

<p>Marijuana definitely does not make us spiritually weak, if anything I would say it promotes spirituality.   </p>

<p>Some strains of Marijuana definitely do cause short term laziness but many strains will also get you up off your ass doing shit even if it&#39;s just to clean the noise as you&#39;ve been putting off since last wkend.     </p>

<p>Marijuana is also used by huge numbers while meditating and I understand why as some of my most enlightening revelations have occurred while stoned.   </p>

<p>What I can only deduce from all of this is that you are either uninformed, misguided or have an agenda to push. Smoking marijuana may not be for everyone but I don&#39;t think that their is a single person whose life cannot be improved by one or another properties of the plant be that industrially, medically or recreationally.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s see. Time for a little inventory. My female best friend when I was in my early twenties got hooked on smoking as a lifestyle choice after a bad breakup. Talented, brilliant and beautiful. About eight years later she was a complete mess. Couldn&#39;t work or function. Ended up committing suicide around fifteen years later.</p>

<p>Two other female friends in their twenties and thirties respectively were always trying to sell me on the harmlessness of smoking, but later both confessed to me that they were smoking throughout the day, spending all their money, in debt to dealers, and unable to stop or work. I lost their phone numbers. Both college educated workers in the DC government arena prior to them being about four to sulus years into heavy daily smoking.</p>

<p>One ex-boyfriend went from casual use once or twice a week to full blown addiction and working as a dealer until he went to jail. I broke off contact at that point. Brilliant guy before addiction set in.</p>

<p>Another ex boyfriend was one of those exes I tried to stay friends with and check in with occasionally. When we were together we were too broke to afford weed. After we broke up he had friends who were big smokers who kept him supplied. He went from being an in demand highly trained actor to a total pothead seducing older women who would finance his habit, and the last I heard, nothing had changed. He watches TV and smokes all day at 50 just like he was doing at 35.</p>

<p>I was close to other smokers but am tired of writing about their sad, misspent lives.</p>

<p>Sounds much more like an issue with depression or other influences in life. I&#39;m sorry about that situation, but attributing smoking as a lifestyle choice as the cause of depression is pretty big accusation to make without going into life details that from what I can gather you don&#39;t know much about in the last fifteen or more years of their life. You might know more, but what you put there doesn&#39;t actually say anything to your point.</p>

<p>This is acting as if there is an actual physical addiction, which is not in any way true. However, I&#39;m going to assume you have recalled this accurately, in which would call out foul play with the stuff they got. Gathering from your post that it&#39;s in DC, it&#39;s not a far stretch to assume it was laced with something and that this problem actually stems from the black market which is only possible due to it&#39;s illegality. Also assuming from DC area, it&#39;s legal in DC now, that this happened some time ago, makes the possibility of laced weed higher. </p>

<p>There is most definitely waaay more to the story than this. </p>

<p>So he&#39;s 50? So he doesn&#39;t work? He just bums on someone&#39;s couch and smokes someone else weed? </p>

<p>Otherwise you&#39;re just saying you don&#39;t like that he&#39;s alive and enjoys his time smoking and watching tv. Doesn&#39;t sound much different than the old drink and watch tv stereotypes that used to be around. </p>

<p>So, from what I gather, you have a problem with weed. People who smoked it around stopped hanging with you because it was an issue. And that means they misspent their lives?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The only thing you&#39;ve got spot on is the bit about Harvard being Ivy League with secret societies. </p>

<p>Passed that, I&#39;d love for you to look into NORML and other such organizations that you just pushed off to side and acted like they didn&#39;t exist. Legalization is COMPLETELY an effort by the people. The government has fought it tooth and nail wholeheartedly the entire time. You&#39;re post mostly shows a lack of knowledge base on the specific substance. </p>

<p>Also you&#39;re negative side effects list is straight from the &quot;Grapevine&quot;. </p>

<p>This little tidbit:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The problem with marijuana is that it has become an addiction for many people. It saps people of ambition, clear thinking, develops paranoia, and makes us spiritually weak. Yes the plant can be helpful, but not in the way it has been marketed. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Where we might come to an agreement is in the corporate take over of what has been black market(which some might argue isn&#39;t much different). I would argue otherwise. Living in a legal state, I am in contact with smokers all day every day. You&#39;re list is far from off. I can understand where you got the misconception though. </p>

<p>I believe the issue here is an image in your head about what smokers are like. Well let me help with that. They are normal people. In fact, more than half marijuana smokers are not identifiable without serious investigation. Get to know your neighbors better. </p>
