        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The term Hollywood derives from the holly tree. The holly tree was used by Druids who were known for being priests and also wizards. The character of Merlin in the legend of King Arthur was a Druid wizard and he used a wand of made of holly wood. Hollywood movies are forms of sorcery using psychology, subliminal messages, and manifestation through what is called &quot;lesser magic&quot; and bewitchment. Today many actors in Hollywood practice witchcraft and kabbalah. The Kabbalah Centre International is located in Los Angeles California and many actors and entertainers are members including Madonna, Demi Moore, Brittany Spears, Ashton Kutcher, Rosie O&#39;Donnell, and Mick Jagger. Most of them can be seen in photographs wearing the &quot;red string&quot; bracelet which represents the red Gevurah sephirot of the Kabbalah Tree which symbolizes fire, wrath, and judgement and this is all related to Mars despite the cover up. Mars is known as the &quot;god of war&quot; in Roman Mythology and the red string Kabbalah cult is covertly promoting a war and holocaust. Mark Breakspear is a Hollywood special effects designer and he comes from the English Breakspear family which produced the only English Pope in history Pope Adrian IV of Nicholas Breakspear who also conquered Ireland for Rome. The name Break-spear translates to Rotti-Lance in Italian for the Lancellotti family. Lancellotti or Breakspear is where Lancelot comes from in the King Arthur legend. The Lancellotti family own a palace in Italy with a hedge maze and clock tower. These symbols are used in the Hollywood movie &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; and mazes or labrynths are meant to confuse or bewitch the mind. Prince Filippo Massimo-Lancellotti II is the head of the Lancellotti family today.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>DARPA and the Department of Defense along with Silicon Valley have developed an artificial singularity through HAARP, satellites, electronics, and chemtrails. HAARP. modern electronics and wireless frequencies are generating geometrically designed programs into society. The chemtrails are made of nano conductive particles that create an electromagnetic fuzz in the air and this enhances these electronic frequencies and creates a type of artificial singularity. These frequencies are hacking into the nerve systems and electrical system of the human biology and can manipulate chemicals, pain, arousal, as well as psychological states. The Church of Scientology is also working with Silicon Valley which has developed weaponized electronics disguised as computers, smart phones, wireless frequencies, and other systems. Sorcery is the unnatural manipulation of unseen forces like sounds, chemical reactions, and vibrational geometries with the intent of manipulating bodily chemistry, thoughts, and physiology. Kabbalah and Hermeticism are common forms of witchcraft practiced by the secret societies. Electronics enhance their sorcery.</p>

<p>The Church of Scientology, Kabbalah Center, and Silicon Valley have worked together to develop electronic weapons based on this witchcraft. The Church of Scientology considers itself a gnostic organization. Modern Gnosticism has been connected with Hermeticism which has a focus on alchemy or the manipulation of bodily chemicals. Kabbalah is similar but more about the manipulation of the mind and physiology through geometric sounds and vibrations. The Church of Scientology is involved with training members to use electronics with witchcraft. They are using electronics and wireless frequencies to torture people. Anonymous and other hacker groups are also involved with this covert persecution. Silicon Valley is partly overseen by Santa Clara University which is a Jesuit college and California&#39;s Jesuit Provincial who is SJ Michael F. Weiler. The Jesuits are also deeply involved with the US military and intelligence agencies. Santa Clara alumni include former CIA Director Leon Panetta, David Drummond the Senior Vice President of Corporate Development at Google, Brendan Eich the co-founder of Mozilla and JavaScript, Jack Kuehler a former top executive and electrical engineer for IBM, former Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano, Peter Oppenheimer the former senior vice president and Chief Financial Officer of Apple. Santa Clara has courses in various sciences, engineering, and psychological counseling.</p>

<p>There is a Church of Scientology located in Silicon Valley and some companies located in Silicon Valley include Sony, Google, Oracle, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Adobe, BEA Systems and many more. Japanese electronics companies work closely with Silicon Valley. Akihito the Emperor of Japan is a Knight of the Order of the Garter and serves the British Crown as the blood appointed head of state in Japan. The British royal family are deeply involved in this criminality and have Crown Knights and Freemasons involved in the US military and intelligence which work alongside the Jesuits and Roman agents. Sky Dayton is a Scientologist and created EarthLink which is a network and communications company. This is all about domination through the most ruthless measures. Many of the leaders in the global crime syndicate refer to themselves as technocrats. Technocracy is about a technological based governing system. Many actors in Hollywood are members of the Church of Scientology like Tom Cruise, John Travolta, and Kirstie Alley. Many in Hollywood are covert members and George Clooney is a top leader of the Hollywood Illuminati. The most ruthless Kabbalists I have come across are Dwayne Johnson, Natalie Portman, Ashton Kutcher, Josh Hartnett, and the rapper RZA.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The rapper RZA from Wu Tang Clan is a member of the Almighty Vice Lord Nation (AVLN) which operates in New Jersey where RZA has a residence. RZA is a shot caller for the AVLN and a 33rd degree freemason. The AVLN was funded by the Rockefeller Foundation and the rapper Jay Z who is worth over 600 million created Roc-a-fella Records and is a member as well. Jay Z displays the hat cocked to the left in professional photos and wears a top hat and both of these are AVLN signs. RZA is a Five Percenter which is connected with the Nation of Islam and the AVLN has incorporated Islam into its beliefs. The Five Percenters are a covert masonic organization and practice Solomon witchcraft and are involved in human sacrifice. RZA sacrificed Ol&#39; Dirty Bastard. Jay Z openly wore an Aleister Crowley shirt in public. Many rappers are members of the AVLN or other criminal organizations as well as masonic societies like the Nation of Islam or Five Percenters. RZA has covertly let me know that he knows where I live. I exposed the House of Saud and how they have a mafia involved with trafficking human beings at the Jersey ports and a few nights later RZA hired some thugs to roll up on my house just after I received a death threat. Jay Electronica is also a masonic Five Percenter and member of the Nation of Islam. He dated Kate Rothschild and lived in London for some time where he was trained by the British Freemasons. Illuminati rappers like RZA, Jay Electronica, Jay Z and others are involved with pedophilia, organized crime, gang stalking, threats, murder, and human trafficking. They also serve the House of Saud. Jay Z uses his hundreds of millions as a front to fund criminal activities. RZA is a hard core Satanist and one hundred percent evil. </p>
