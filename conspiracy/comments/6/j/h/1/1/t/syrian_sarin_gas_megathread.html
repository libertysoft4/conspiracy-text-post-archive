Imagine, if you will, the outrage here in the West, had a Syrian MP stood forward and given testimony about Assad using sarin gas on the Syrians.
But, alas, it is a NATO ally that gassed the Syrians, so it is all of no concern to any of us. (Except to Russia Today, of course, but they can be safely dismissed as being biased to the point of outright propaganda. So we don&#39;t have to pay them any mind.)</p>

Isn&#39;t this referring to the air raids a week ago?
The Syrian regime yesterday carried out a chlorine gas attack on opposition-held parts of the Hama countryside, injuring 100 civilians, the Anadolu Agency reported Syrian medical sources as saying. - MiddleEastMonitor March 31, 2017
Worth noting is also that Idlib is not in the Hama province, and I am pretty sure the symptoms on the victims of Idlib point to a nerve agent rather than chlorine.

<p>There was literally never a case for the &quot;Syrian-sarin case&quot;. The rockets used in the attack would have to have been fired from deep within &quot;rebel&quot; territory, as they only had a range of 2km. As well, the Britam leak already blew the lid off the &quot;Syrian-sarin&quot; false flag attack. The icing on the cake, that this was an inside job, was the fact that the White House&#39;s &quot;evidence&quot; was literally nothing at all.

<p>once you mix up the gas it gets a shelf life. The lie that a depot full of it was bombed is silly.
They keep the ingredients seperate until it is needed no way it could have not been dropped by a plane.
Unless it was pre mixed and set there for this occasion. Either way the lie that it was a depot full of gas is bullshit and for the uninformed. The chemistry behind the way sarin gas works makes the explanation inherently false.
Even if the precursors were together in a shed and hit by a bomb they would not mix properly to make sarin gas ever....</p>

Put your self in to Assad&#39;s shoes. You have just stopped one of the biggest rebel offensives since Aleppo recently. Rebels pushed back to fighting in Idlib. Wide spread change in international support recently as well. Why would Assad try and Bomb his own people after such successes in recent weeks?
Now this is where turkey comes into play. Note that Turkey has proposed staging false flag chemical weapons attacks in Syria recently. This possibility is even more likely considering the closeness in proximity of Idlib province in Syria to Turkey.
Furthermore, factions in Turkey have not only been providing conventional weapons and small arms to the Syrian rebels already, but they have also provided them chemical weapons precursors.</p>

&quot;It supports Seymour Hersh’s reporting that the notorious sarin gas attack at Ghouta was a false flag orchestrated by Turkish intelligence in order to cross President Obama’s chemical weapons “red line” and draw the United States into the Syria war to topple Assad.&quot;</p>

<p>I&#39;ve had suspicions about this very thing. I&#39;m beginning to wonder if the Saudi government and the CIA are collaborating on some kind of dirty mafia-style dealings. The guys blamed for 9/11 were (as a majority) from Saudi Arabia as well, right? I&#39;ve heard it said that the CIA was in on the Libyan rebellion, and that they were turning Al-Qaida soldiers loose and arming them. Could it be possible that the Saudi&#39;s were sending in reinforcements throughout the conflict? I&#39;m not sure what to make of any of it, but it reeks of shit. I&#39;ve heard from talking to people that the reason for killing Gaddafi was because he wanted to have his oil exports paid for in gold, of which the United States Federal Reserve owns absolutely none of. I don&#39;t know how true that is either, but somehow all this bullshit seems like it could all be related. <strong>In Wesley Clark&#39;s statement about the &quot;seven countries in 5 years&quot;, Libya, Syria, and Iraq are part of the seven countries, where Saudi Arabia is not. Perhaps the Saudi regime is in on the seven countries deal? Or maybe I&#39;m reading in too deeply. You never can tell anymore.</strong>

<p>There was literally never a case for the &quot;Syrian-sarin case&quot;. The rockets used in the attack would have to have been fired from deep within &quot;rebel&quot; territory, as they only had a range of 2km. As well, the Britam leak already blew the lid off the &quot;Syrian-sarin&quot; false flag attack. The icing on the cake, that this was an inside job, was the fact that the White House&#39;s &quot;evidence&quot; was literally nothing at all. Seriously, no one saw a single shred of proof that it was Assad because it was &quot;secret&quot;. At least when Bush duped us into war, he fabricated evidence, the Obama administration didn&#39;t even bother.</p>

<p>New article, suspiciously timed, and it reads like Assad&#39;s government was responsible. Not even a sentence given to provide balance:</p>

<p><strong>Bypassing all claims of ‘conspiracy theory’, it was actually Yahoo News that published an eerily psychic piece that warned of moves by the Obama administration to launch a chemical attack in Syria and blame it on Assad’s regime.</strong> 
<a href="http://www.infowars.com/flashback-yahoo-uncovered-syria-chemical-weapon-false-flag-in-january/">http://www.infowars.com/flashback-yahoo-uncovered-syria-chemical-weapon-false-flag-in-january/</a></p>

<p><strong>The Obama administration gave green signal to a chemical weapons attack plan in Syria that could be blamed on President Bashar al Assad&#39;s regime and in turn, spur international military action in the devastated country, leaked documents have shown.</strong>

<p><strong>In the exchange, it’s revealed that there is a plan to unleash chemical weapons in Syria in order to blame it on the Bashar Al Assad regime to justify a direct intervention by U.S. and NATO forces in the country&#39;s civil war.</strong> <a href="http://www.examiner.com/article/hacked-e-mails-reveal-washington-approved-plan-to-stage-syria-chemical-attack">http://www.examiner.com/article/hacked-e-mails-reveal-washington-approved-plan-to-stage-syria-chemical-attack</a></p>

<p>The attack ‘was not the result of the current regime’, he wrote. A former senior intelligence official told me that the Obama administration had altered the available information – in terms of its timing and sequence – to enable the president and his advisers to make intelligence retrieved days after the attack look as if it had been picked up and analysed in real time, as the attack was happening. </p>

<p>The distortion, he said, reminded him of the 1964 Gulf of Tonkin incident <a href="http://www.lrb.co.uk/v35/n24/seymour-m-hersh/whose-sarin">http://www.lrb.co.uk/v35/n24/seymour-m-hersh/whose-sarin</a></p>

<p>As intercepts and other data related to the 21 August attacks were gathered, the intelligence community saw evidence to support its suspicions. ‘We now know it was a covert action planned by Erdoğan’s people to push Obama over the red line,’ the former intelligence official said. ‘They had to escalate to a gas attack in or near Damascus when the UN inspectors’ – who arrived in Damascus on 18 August to investigate the earlier use of gas – ‘were there. <a href="http://www.lrb.co.uk/v36/n08/seymour-m-hersh/the-red-line-and-the-rat-line">http://www.lrb.co.uk/v36/n08/seymour-m-hersh/the-red-line-and-the-rat-line</a></p>

<p>The French report said that the airstrike on Khan Sheikhoun showed similarities to a Syrian attack on Saraqib, also in Idlib, on April 29, 2013. This conclusion was based on analysis of an unexploded grenade which was used &quot;with certainty&quot; by Assad forces during the Saraqib attack, according to the report.</p>

<p><strong>I think France might have made a serious tactical error here. By bringing up the chemical attack that occurred in Saraqeb on April 29, 2013, they have brought focus onto some important evidence regarding that specific chemical attack.</strong></p>

<p>PRI - GlobalPost May 5, 2013
REYHANLI, Turkey — Doctors in Turkey say initial tests of blood samples from victims of a suspected chemical weapons attack in Syria last month are negative for sarin gas. 
Medics tested the blood samples — which were taken from some 13 victims of an attack that included white powder in the northern village of Saraqeb on April 29 — at the Reyhanli hospital on the same day, but did not find anything unusual, they said. </p>

<p>They tested the blood specifically for sarin gas — a nerve agent — and also ran regular bloodwork. 
PRI GlobalPost May 6, 2013
On Sunday, UN human rights investigator Carla del Ponte, who is a member of the commission, said, &quot;According to the testimonies we have gathered, the rebels have used chemical weapons, making use of sarin gas.&quot;
&quot;We still have to deepen our investigation, verify and confirm (the findings) through new witness testimony, but according to what we have established so far, it is at the moment opponents of the regime who are using sarin gas,&quot; del Ponte said in an interview on Swiss radio.</p>

<p>Del Ponte&#39;s remarks were based on &quot;witness testimony&quot;, she said. But eyewitness testimony can also be unreliable.
7 days ago, I made a post on this subreddit voicing my concern that it appeared there was a narrative being formed about the April 2017 attack that was attempting to bypass any UN involvement.

Troubling narrative being formed on Syria chemical attack as FOX News attempts to delegitimize the UN (self.conspiracy)
submitted 2 months ago * by AIsuicide
The headline: UN seeks top role in Syria crisis, but its record is sketchy</p>

<p>The hit: The United Nations&#39; renewed efforts to play a lead role in settling the Syria crisis have only renewed questions about the world body&#39;s shortcomings keeping a check on the Assad regime so far. </p>

<p>Lavrov statement: “We think that it is absolutely necessary to conduct a thorough, objective, professional, and unbiased investigation,” Lavrov said. “We will insist that the OPCW and the U.N. in New York urgently send inspectors both to the site of the incident and the airfield itself, where, according to Western experts, the munitions were loaded with chemicals.”</p>

<p>Reuters reported that the OPCW already has dispatched investigators to Turkey to collect samples. The mission reportedly will determine if chemical weapons were used, but will not assign blame. <strong>The results are expected in May and will be be passed to a U.N.-OPCW investigation. An OPCW spokesman declined to comment on ongoing investigations to Fox News.</strong></p>

<p>So, why is this important? It says the results are expected in May.
Headline from BBC just hours ago: Syria war: Sarin used in Khan Sheikhoun attack, OPCW says
Lead paragraph: &quot;Incontrovertible&quot; test results show sarin gas or a similar substance was used in the chemical weapons attack in Syria earlier this month, the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) says.
So, will the UN have any input? It sounds like the BBC and FOX news have already made up their minds.
If CNN or MSNBC come out with hit pieces on the UN tomorrow I&#39;m going to get very concerned.
Update: <strong>As of May 13, 2017 the UN and OPCW have still not investigated the actual scene of the attack.</strong></p>

Now we are hearing that the Trump administration has decided Assad&#39;s fate operating solely on false intelligence reports from Paris.
Excerpt from article:
London – Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov’s meetings in Washington revealed an ongoing dispute between the two countries regarding the fate of head of Syria’s regime Bashar al-Assad. The administration of President Donald Trump insists on “cutting off the head” of Syria’s regime and 20 others of its aids, while Moscow warned from “the repetition of the Iraqi and Libyan models” in Syria, western diplomatic sources told Asharq Al-Awsat on Friday.
The sources said Trump’s administration now “has a clear position from Assad after intelligence apparatus in Washington, London and Paris received proofs that the Syrian regime was 100 percent responsible about the chemical attack in Khan Sheikhoun,” when its air forces attacked civilians in the countryside of Idlib.

What the media are not telling anyone. The hand grenade type weapon that was used in the Khan Sheikhoun attack on April 4, 2017 has a very suspicious and troubling backstory.
Paris used one of these un-exploded grenades for its testing of Sarin or Sarin-type gas and is the sole piece of evidence being used to determine the fate of Assad.
It&#39;s a lie...they know it&#39;s a lie...and if someone doesn&#39;t bring this to the forefront of the public&#39;s attention, then we are encouraging the regime changing and nation building foreign policy that has devastated our country through debt.

    <div class="md"><p>The Obama administration&#39;s role in the overthrow of Syria and rise of ISIS (self.conspiracy)
submitted 6 months ago * by soberreflection
By now, most people on this board are aware of the role of the Obama government in toppling Assad and fostering the rise of ISIS. To say that &quot;Obama created ISIS&quot; is perhaps too simplistic, but the actual truth is no less damning. I&#39;ve made this post, partly to organize my own notes on this subject, but also to seek other references and hopefully reach people who are unaware of the facts and balk at allegations that the US has been involved in any way in the rise of ISIS.
First, the plans to topple Assad&#39;s government in Syria were not laid by Obama&#39;s administration. They are part of a long-term project to maintain control of the region and the petrodollar regime—basically the &quot;neoconservative agenda&quot; spelled out in the &quot;Project for a New American Century&quot;.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_for_the_New_American_Century">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_for_the_New_American_Century</a>
<a href="http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/pdf/RebuildingAmericasDefenses.pdf">http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/pdf/RebuildingAmericasDefenses.pdf</a> (Syria, page 63-64)
<a href="https://youtu.be/r8YtF76s-yM">https://youtu.be/r8YtF76s-yM</a>
And how would the overthrow of Assad be orchestrated? Obama has wished, or sought to create the impression that he wished, to avoid direct military engagement in Syria. Whether for political concerns, to avoid appearing to be a warmonger, or because of a misguided belief that his chosen method of indirect engagement would be somehow more ethical or less brutal, is hard to determine exactly. But here is some mainstream coverage of the reasoning shaping the Obama administration&#39;s policy on removing Assad:
<a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-syria-crisis-obama-war-idUSBRE97U0AP20130831">http://www.reuters.com/article/us-syria-crisis-obama-war-idUSBRE97U0AP20130831</a>
What&#39;s important, though, is that Obama is following through with the PNAC agenda. And the chosen method of engagement, instead of direct military invasion, was subversion through the orchestration of the State Department, the CIA, and regional allies, especially Turkey, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_involvement_in_the_Syrian_Civil_War">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_involvement_in_the_Syrian_Civil_War</a>
To implement the regime change operation, the first stage was to orchestrate &quot;dissidents&quot; through CIA and State Department sponsored NGOs. To fuel the necessary anti-Assad propaganda campaign, it is first necessary to create the impression that there is a &quot;grassroots&quot; uprising ready to burst out. It should be acknowledged that Assad is not so benevolent a leader that he could not inspire legitimate dissidents, but the fact that mass protest movements were orchestrated was established by leaked cables:
<a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-syria-wikileaks-idUSTRE73H0E720110418">http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-syria-wikileaks-idUSTRE73H0E720110418</a>
The next stage was to enact a false flag attack that would tarnish Assad&#39;s reputation and provide the pretext of legitimacy for the insurrection that would bring about his removal. Of course, adhering to its policy of avoiding direct involvement, US intelligence orchestrated the gas attack against the protesting dissidents that it helped to put in place by relying on its foreign allies:

And now the &quot;rebels&quot; enter the scene. But only moderate rebels, of course, a phrase chosen no doubt because it causes the reader to imagine there are some tea-sipping British Labor voting type armed insurgents ready to bring about a democratic &quot;Arab Spring&quot; in Syria. Nevermind that some of the principal fighting groups being sponsored are affiliates of Al Qaeda:
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_armed_groups_in_the_Syrian_Civil_War">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_armed_groups_in_the_Syrian_Civil_War</a>
And then there is ISIS. Who created ISIS? In a sense, it&#39;s a pointless discussion. Movements like ISIS, like any ideological movement, have antecedents in other movements. According to the conventional view, which we&#39;ll stick to here, its &quot;founder&quot;, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, was a member of Al Qaeda that led the faction of it that would become ISIS. A better question is who pays to arm ISIS, who provides it with intelligence, and who protects it? While ISIS can generate its own revenue to some extent, it would not have been able to operate without funding, principally from Saudi Arabia and Qatar:

Of course, some of John Podesta&#39;s leaked emails confirmed what we already knew there, showing that Hillary Clinton (and implicitly, everyone else privy to the same intelligence knowledge she had) knows that the governments of Saudi Arabia and Qatar are funding ISIS:
<a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/3774">https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/3774</a>

<a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/1828">https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/1828</a>
But, some may say, that does not mean that the Obama administration knew about or sanctioned this funding of ISIS. And to that, I would say there is evidence they knew, as Michael Flynn former DIA Director explains in the following interview. But I would also add that assuming that US intelligence was not aware that its allies were funding ISIS is naive, and there&#39;s every reason to believe that it&#39;s exactly what they wanted because it would help to achieve their goal of toppling Assad. All we&#39;re missing is hard evidence of direct involvement of US intelligence with ISIS, but there are clues of that too:

Thus are the origins of the Syrian &quot;Civil War&quot;, which brought death and destruction to scores of innocent Syrians and launched the great migration. This humanitarian disaster has not only destroyed this country&#39;s people and infrastructure, its consequences have placed Europe&#39;s security in jeopardy, have propelled the undoing of the EU, and are likely to lead to violence there before all is finally settled.
And for what? I thought it ironic that some people had been criticizing Trump&#39;s pick of Rex Tillerson of Exxon-Mobil, as a demonstration that Trump is getting ready to run the government for big oil—ironic because it has been that way all along. Indeed, the Exxon-Mobil deal with Russia was nixed by Obama, who instead chose to sponsor the Saudi-Qatar pipeline that would need to run through Syria. Leaked cables again show that it was precisely when Assad refused to allow the pipeline to plow through Syria that the plans to topple him were set in motion:

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qatar-Turkey_pipeline">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qatar-Turkey_pipeline</a>
Was reducing Europe&#39;s reliance on Russian oil and catering to Middle Eastern allies by toppling the Syrian government and plunging it into war the more ethical approach? Now that the project has failed, I wonder how it can possibly be justified at all.</p>

Lotta stuff there. Good research. Here is my take on the same story for comparing notes. Cheers.
This is the conspiracy that brought me to this sub. This isnt a left/right issue. It is a US foreign policy issue. This is a post that <a href="/u/037_engineering">/u/037_engineering</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/u/037_engineering">https://www.reddit.com/u/037_engineering</a> made when they cleaned up one of my old posts. Theirs is better written and less partisan. But its a topic that has been public knowledge for some time but only twice have I seen it spelled out. Once by Assange and once by Greenwald on The Intercept. The reason we can trust this politician in this case is because it is verifiable and documented. If not actually spelled out until just now by Rep. Gabbard.
This has been posted a few times but people still deny it ever happened, let alone continues to happen <a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/290916-us-approves-115b-military-sale-to-saudi-arabia">http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/290916-us-approves-115b-military-sale-to-saudi-arabia</a> (The Hill) and in fact, was prevented from being blocked <a href="http://www.salon.com/2016/09/21/senate-rejects-bill-blocking-u-s-saudi-arms-deal-rights-groups-applaud-growing-dissent-against-yemen-war-crimes/">http://www.salon.com/2016/09/21/senate-rejects-bill-blocking-u-s-saudi-arms-deal-rights-groups-applaud-growing-dissent-against-yemen-war-crimes/</a> (Salon) as recently as September.

This entire effort should be done with a low profile, avoiding the massive traditional military operations that are at best temporary solutions. While this military/para-military operation is moving forward, we need to use our diplomatic and more traditional intelligence assets to bring pressure on the governments of Qatar and Saudi Arabia, which are providing clandestine financial and logistic support to ISIL and other radical Sunni groups in the region.
Its necessary to point out that the significance of this email is not what it literally states, obviously the US would rather limit ISIS&#39; influence in the region. The context is that the US knew that Saudi Arabia was arming ISIS when the US State Department approved $115 Billion Dollars worth of arms deals to Saudi Arabia <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-saudi-security-idUSKCN11D2JQ">http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-saudi-security-idUSKCN11D2JQ</a></p>

It is also likely that some of the small arms in IS’ possession – such as an M4 carbine-style Bushmaster X15E2S manufactured in the USA and documented in IS’ arsenal entered Iraq with private security companies during the US occupation and found their way into Iraqi arms markets.

submitted 2 months ago * by andywarhaul
This may be a shock but China, Russia, or the US couldn&#39;t give a damn about Assad, the people of Syria and whether or not they were gassed by Assad. Forget if the attack is a false flag or not because it doesn&#39;t effect the point and that&#39;s that they all only give a shit about gas and oil.
Let&#39;s lay it out to highlight why toppling Assad is important to Israel, USA, and Saudi Arabia. And why keeping Assad standing is important to Russia and Turkey. It will also highlight why China and Iran don&#39;t give a fuck about what happens either way.
Scene is the Middle East
The big players are Iran, Syria, Turkey, Russia, Israel, USA, Saudi Arabia and China
The prize is the South Pars gas/oil field <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Pars_/_North_Dome_Gas-Condensate_field">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Pars_/_North_Dome_Gas-Condensate_field</a>
The Iranians have an insane amount of untapped gas and oil. A combination of sanctions by the US, the inaccessibility of the reserves, and scores of other more easily accessed reserves have delayed Iran developing on it. They have just started producing in the last week or so
<a href="http://oilprice.com/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/Irans-South-Pars-Oil-Field-To-Produce-By-End-Of-March.html">http://oilprice.com/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/Irans-South-Pars-Oil-Field-To-Produce-By-End-Of-March.html</a>
The closest market for all that oil is Europe but you need a pipeline to get it there. There&#39;s a few options of where it could go through.
Iran doesn&#39;t give a fuck about where the gas and oil goes at all because no matter what they are getting paid.
China also doesn&#39;t give a fuck because they along with a French company have a 50% stake in the deal with Iran to develop the field. On top of that they are reported to be involved in investing over 42 billion dollars in developing the portion of the pipeline in Iran.
Let&#39;s look at the possible routes for that pipeline once it leaves Iran
We&#39;ll call this one the American Express
<a href="http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/335809bc5a4500918ff797c8a540c039">http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/335809bc5a4500918ff797c8a540c039</a>
And this one the Russian Run
<a href="https://m.imgur.com/a/nECpe">https://m.imgur.com/a/nECpe</a>
<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_Pipeline">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_Pipeline</a>
So starting with the American Express, we&#39;ve established that between Iran and China the development and pipeline infrastructure inside Iran is covered. Both Iran and China will make money no matter what.
With the American Express the next stage would be building a pipeline through Iraq:
Getting into the finer mechanics, the US the Saudis and the Israelis all lack control over Iran and Turkey, in other words they wouldn&#39;t be getting a cut of the profits if it goes through Turkey. Plus they have their own natural gas and oil asserts that would see a decrease in value when the South Pars starts producing full blast. So they want to make sure they are getting a cut.
Next they are going to want to make a route which they have total control over. The shortest route between Iran and the Mediterranean is through Iraq and Syria. So ideally you would want to take control of both of those countries to build your pipeline.
Iraq ✅ the US took care of that some time ago
Syria ❌
With Iraq under control that pesky Assad is all that stands in the way of the pipeline. Thank god for American aptitude at scheming to topple regimes. America is so talented at doing this that they cooked up a top shelf idea. What if you could take out 2 maybe even more birds at once with one stone? We&#39;re talking about consolidating oil/gas/energy power here and in that realm Gaddafis Libya was a major hindrance and threat to future oil/gas value and power for the Saudis and Israelis in the region.
The plan they hatched would solve the Gaddafi problem as well as work towards toppling Assad and they might just get lucky and bring down a couple more dictators with them. They would need a plan like this as the Russians were supporting Assad due to their interests which we will get into with the Russian Run.
Phase one of the plan was orchestrating and precipitating the &quot;Arab Spring&quot;. The goal was to destabilize the region and spark rebellions by the people, destabilizing the region surrounding a target (Assad) is a classic regime toppling technique.
<a href="https://wikileaks.org/google-is-not-what-it-seems/">https://wikileaks.org/google-is-not-what-it-seems/</a>
Phase 2 is to fund and arm a group of rebels to form an army. Once the uprising in Libya was sparked the US used their intelligence of the Libyan demographics and social structure to did their army. When Gaddafi came to power it was under the promise that strict sharia law would be the lay of the land and there would a be Sharia court that ruled supreme. He fell through on that promise and while sharia law was practiced in Libya it was not enforced in the traditional sense, he also created a civil sharia court system but it was essentially a bullshit court that didn&#39;t have the power the extremist population wanted. Gaddafi quickly grasped the country in an Iron fist with his loyal military (he was an army man) and crushed any dissenters. In other words there were many angry extremist Libyans who were upset with Gaddafi but were suppressed by his military strength. The US knew that there were some 200,000 of these extremists willing to fight Gaddafi. They sent these 200,000 &quot;rebels&quot; money and weapons, then with their friends the US bombed the shit out of Gaddafis Air Force, choking his militaries main weapon. With no airforce and a heavily armed, well funded, and angry army of 200,000 tearing through the country it wasn&#39;t long until Gaddafi fell.
A few goals were achieved. They stopped Gaddafi from creating a North African currency, they eliminated a threat to their control over the region, and they took control over an oil competitor. Libya was producing 1.6 million barrels of oil a day before the civil war. Just this passed year they have managed to get back to 500,000 barrels a day. Libya is no longer a competitor.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The main goal was that they had an army on the ground now in the 200,000 rebels. These &quot;rebels&quot; were cheated, they thought they would take over Libya and make it a sharia paradise, but the Americans did what they do and installed a puppet government. Screwed in that respect and screwed in the respect that their country was now destroyed, 100,000 of the rebels (with some guidance I&#39;m sure, we know various intelligence assets are involved with these groups in the region <a href="http://21stcenturywire.com/2016/12/16/reports-at-least-10-nato-military-officers-captured-by-syrian-special-forces-this-morning-in-east-aleppo-bunker/">http://21stcenturywire.com/2016/12/16/reports-at-least-10-nato-military-officers-captured-by-syrian-special-forces-this-morning-in-east-aleppo-bunker/</a>) decided that they would leave Libya with their guns and money and make their way on to Syria where the uprising was still going on and Assad stood as another &quot;not extremist enough&quot; leader who they could take down. On their way over they meet up with various groups that used to make up the Iraqi army. Including many former officers. <a href="http://time.com/3900753/isis-iraq-syria-army-united-states-military/">http://time.com/3900753/isis-iraq-syria-army-united-states-military/</a>
Together they morphed like a fucked up power ranger to make ISIS. They would wreak havoc over the region for the better half of a decade but thanks to the Russian backing Syria held strong the entire time. The plan was hitting a snag, Assad needed to fall and it looked like it would take real military intervention, but that won&#39;t happen as long as Russia backs them. Sarin gas false flag attacks are a good way to weaken Russia&#39;s support for Assad and sway public opinion to go to war. They tried that in 2013 and it didn&#39;t quite work. Obama was close and so ready to drop the bombs but he was stopped by Congress
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/31/syrian-air-strikes-obama-congress">https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/31/syrian-air-strikes-obama-congress</a>

So the American Saudi Israeli faction failed to clear the way for their pipeline and we will pause there for right now. Isis is being ejected from Syria and it appears as though they are winning the civil war.
Now on the other side we have the Russian Run:
Phase 1 would be to ensure there is no path for the oppositions pipeline by supporting Assad and not letting Syria fall. Done.
The three (Iran Russia Turkey) even have a plan to split up Syria into control zones for themselves <a href="http://mobile.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN14H12V">http://mobile.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN14H12V</a>
Phase 2 would be to build the pipeline infrastructure for the new route.
This pipeline already exists and could be adapted <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabriz%E2%80%93Ankara_pipeline">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabriz%E2%80%93Ankara_pipeline</a> but this pipeline was the new option <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_Pipeline">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_Pipeline</a>
So infrastructure is nearly completed or already completed, that combined with production at the South Pars field finally starting to flow made the Russian Run a much more serious and impending reality.
Just look how cozy all of the players involved in the Russian Run are getting lately
Russia selling $10 billion in arms to Iran

They were clamping it down in Syria
<a href="http://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/13784886">http://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/13784886</a>
There&#39;s even a prophecy that these allies will join to fight Israel but that&#39;s more for fun. <a href="http://www.alphanewsdaily.com/Warning%206%20Russia%20Iran%20Invasion.html">http://www.alphanewsdaily.com/Warning%206%20Russia%20Iran%20Invasion.html</a>
But there&#39;s some small snags in the Russian Run as well. Russia wants the west to have no influence over anyone involved in this deal to keep their hands off of it completely. This would include getting Turkey out of NATO (Turkey is also a key location for NATO in the region). I believe they got the ball rolling on that one by arranging for the Russian Ambassador to Turkey to be assassinated.
<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/19/europe/turkey-russian-ambassador-shot/">http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/19/europe/turkey-russian-ambassador-shot/</a>
Many people were quick (including Russia and Turkey <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/2438405/key-ally-of-vladimir-putin-claims-shadowy-nato-forces-masterminded-the-assassination-of-russian-ambassador-andrey-karlov/">https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/2438405/key-ally-of-vladimir-putin-claims-shadowy-nato-forces-masterminded-the-assassination-of-russian-ambassador-andrey-karlov/</a> <a href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/britain-blamed-after-russias-ambassador-9488222">http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/britain-blamed-after-russias-ambassador-9488222</a> ) to blame western intelligence for the assassination but I think that&#39;s a little too perfect. Just look at the situation, the only security guard on the Amb detail ends up being the shooter. Think about who controls his security schedule and who would have handled security at the venue. Sounds like an inside job if I&#39;ve ever seen one. And if it was the wests doing it would be with the purpose of souring Russia turkey relations but they would have been able to see through that easily. In my opinion it serves the will of Russia and Turkey far more, it&#39;s a precursor for Turkey to leave NATO claiming a lack of trust in other members. Don&#39;t believe me? Not two weeks after the assassination the Turks are asserting their right to close an air bases used by NATO to conduct air strikes on Syria <a href="http://www.veteranstoday.com/2017/01/05/turkey-leaving-nato-asserts-right-to-close-key-base-for-coalition/">http://www.veteranstoday.com/2017/01/05/turkey-leaving-nato-asserts-right-to-close-key-base-for-coalition/</a> they are absolutely gearing up to leave NATO.
With all these things falling in place for the Russian Run they are oh so close to making the pipeline and the billions of dollars attached to it a reality!
But as of this week it looks the the American Express is taking one last swing at conquering Syria. A second Sarin gas attack has allegedly taken place and the evidence suggests that it was most likely carried out by terrorist groups in Syria
<a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2017-04-06/ron-paul-zero-chance-assad-behind-chemical-weapons-attack-syria-likely-false-flag">http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2017-04-06/ron-paul-zero-chance-assad-behind-chemical-weapons-attack-syria-likely-false-flag</a>
All chemical weapons were taken from Assad in 2013 <a href="http://mobile.reuters.com/article/idUSBRE98E01W20130915">http://mobile.reuters.com/article/idUSBRE98E01W20130915</a>
ISIS manufacturing Chemical Weapons in Syria <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/isis-manufacturing-and-using-chemical-weapons-in-iraq-and-syria-us-official-claims-10496094.html">http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/isis-manufacturing-and-using-chemical-weapons-in-iraq-and-syria-us-official-claims-10496094.html</a> <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-34211838">http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-34211838</a>
And they use them <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/cia-director-john-brennan-60-minutes-scott-pelley/">http://www.cbsnews.com/news/cia-director-john-brennan-60-minutes-scott-pelley/</a>
If this attack is used to precipitate a US-Syria war then it appears that the American Express is still wanting to push through. But with the Russian Run so close to completion does it really matter? Iran is going to want to start making money ASAP so if the Russian Run line is completed first (which it will) then I&#39;m sure they will go with it. Unless....some pesky US sanctions appear and force them to slow down development again
<a href="http://www.ogj.com/articles/print/volume-96/issue-21/in-this-issue/general-interest/us-waives-sanctions-on-south-pars-field.html">http://www.ogj.com/articles/print/volume-96/issue-21/in-this-issue/general-interest/us-waives-sanctions-on-south-pars-field.html</a>
To sum up my point it&#39;s too late for Syria they have played their role in scheme for Russia and Russia/Turkey are so close to the prize that it&#39;s no longer as pressing of an issue to ensure Assad stays in power. Because of that Russia won&#39;t be rushing to start world war 3 with the US. And China certainly won&#39;t because they are getting paid regardless. I think this is a feeble attempt by the controlling powers of the west to bundle in one last shot at getting Syria while at the same time creating a situation that will muddy the waters for the Trump administration. So don&#39;t fret. World war 3 won&#39;t start over this, unless the US does some bat shit insane move like invading Iran...who wanted that again?

    <div class="md"><p>Russia would prefer not to be surrounded by failed states with Islamist factions at war with each other.    It would prefer secular governments that are reasonable more than ideological.   And the US?  It is creating that insability that is a threat to Russia&#39;s order in its border areas.    </p>

<p>The equation is not that different in the Ukraine,  except in that case the US also installs weapons systems on Russia&#39;s border that are loyal to NATO.    How could Russia welcome that?   Russia instead will take measures to secure its bases in Crimea.   Why is anyone surprised?   Because they do not know that the US provoked the whole situation by sponsoring a coup immediately before an election was scheduled in the Ukraine.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great thread. Thanks for including my posts. I need to clarify something in one of my posts. The April 4, 2017 attack was not with the hand grenade weapon. But OPCW has testified that the samples from the 2013 attack taken from one of the grenades is a 100% match to the April 4 2017 attack.</p>

<p>As far as I know. No one has shown any physical evidence of the delivery vehicle used in the 2017 attack.</p>

<p>Only pictures of the crater. </p>

<p>I wanted to be clear on this so that we can avoid any future misstatement regarding the actual delivery method used in the Khan Sheikhoun attack.
