        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hi <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a></p>

<p><em>TLDR</em>: Natural mechanisms of psychology and social dynamics make everyone willing to actively change the status quo into an inhuman &#39;alien species&#39;. Otherwise they fail to bring the changes to the world.</p>

<p>As in any complex domain, in order to understand and interpret observed facts regarding politics, business etc., one needs to be aware of the underlying dynamics and interactions. I will try to give you my (current) understanding in this post. And things are quite complex. Beware of the desire to see the world as black and white - it is our natural human bias and we would love to have simple explanations for everything. Often they just don&#39;t exist.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Imagine you want to change the world. Instead of just complaining and being outraged. How would you go about it? In your current state you are most likely a powerless little bug, crawling under the feet of giants. Even if you have the luck to be in top 1% of worldwide earners ($32,400 annually). Even if you&#39;re there AND one of the lucky few not constrained by loans and mortgages, there&#39;s not much you can do to change the big picture.</p></li>
<li><p>So you need to accumulate money and power somehow.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>But let&#39;s pause here - if you seriously want to do this instead of just saying how hard it is, how rigged the system is, you&#39;re already very different from the majority of the population who are happy to be unhappy and do nothing about it. Imagine how small that group is (unconstrained, willing and actually taking action) compared to the 7Bn humans we have on the planet. Something makes you different, and you probably have at least one of the following traits:</p>

<ul>
<li>ignorance (yeah, ignorance is power when you embark on a journey not realizing the risks)</li>
<li>power hungriness (who do you think <em>you</em> are to change the <em>world</em> instead of living how others do?)</li>
<li>fame seeking (maybe you love being in the spotlight? maybe you think it&#39;d be cool to be a famous actor or a celebrity?)</li>
<li>greed (maybe you&#39;re thinking that money is king and it can solve all problems? you think it&#39;s cool to be on a top 100 richest list?)</li>
<li>a fighter attitude (there are easier ways to satisfy it, becoming a MMA fighter, a soldier, a bankster or a gangster)</li>
<li>just a very large inner drive (ADHD much?)</li>
</ul>

<p>Where it comes from doesn&#39;t matter a lot, it may be just genes running in the family, a random mutation, some acquired neurological disorder, a consequence of some trauma, or a reason impossible to pinpoint altogether.</p>

<p>The immediate consequence of any of these traits is that you are not exactly following the social norms, you are an outlier. You are ready to sacrifice (maybe just) a bit of the social standards and norms to satisfy your additional needs.</p>

<p>But let&#39;s assume you&#39;re a genuinely good person with strong morals.</p>

<ol>
<li>You enter the power market and want your slice.</li>
</ol>

<p>After some time you realize that in this small group of people you belong to, there is an even smaller fraction who are successful in accumulating power. How are they different from the others? They are more experienced than others, they are more ruthless, they are &quot;trading with their morals&quot;, they are willing to sacrifice a lot. They form cliques. Without joining a clique, an established &quot;brokerage of power&quot; your influence is extremely limited even if you are rich. Any move you make that can endanger any single member of a clique will be met with resistance from all the other members of that clique. And even if you are rich, let&#39;s say you have $10Bn, you can lose it all almost instantly if you turn a clique against you, game over.</p>

<p>Most exclusive clubs operate based on the following basic dynamics:</p>

<ul>
<li>mutual trust</li>
<li>strong loyalty and cooperation within the group</li>
<li>a single member sacrifices his personal interest for the benefit of the group when required</li>
<li>the group defends its members against external attacks</li>
</ul>

<p>The group may have strong morals and be ideologically sound. But eventually you will be expected to sacrifice your own morals, cross your own boundaries &quot;for the greater good&quot;, whatever it may mean.</p>

<p>A group with enough power may face a choice of either killing 10,000 people, or witnessing millions starve to death. Morals end here (if they even lasted that long!), an agenda, ideology and loyalty to the cause take over.</p>

<p>At this stage you become disconnected from the population so much that you see a news report about 10,000 people being killed and you&#39;re happy that millions won&#39;t starve to death. All while a whole country mourns the 10,000 deaths, and TV viewers are shocked (or rather indifferent nowadays). Yes, these are the choices some people need to make if they got this far.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>You realize that at this level every choice you make can be painted in many ways for the public, depending on who pays the painter&#39;s salary. So everything is shrouded in secrecy, because bad PR could destroy your whole group. When shit happens one of your peers takes the role of a scapegoat. Just to be safe information is compartmentalized, nobody has the full picture, there are groups within cliques, there are direct connections and channels. Families. Networks. Clubs. When something is visible to the naked eye, it usually is just the tip of an iceberg. Money is an inconvenient form of power, because it can be lost or taken away. Connections, influence and &quot;potential to cause things happen&quot; are much better.</p></li>
<li><p>But you still have too little power to change things for real. Why? Because there are other cliques like yours. And they will resist when your actions are against their interests. What are their true interests, goals and agendas? Are they good or evil? It is impossible to know for real without joining them. You cannot judge their true goals by their actions, because you lack context and full information, just like you&#39;re obfuscating your own goals - to make it hard for others to disrupt your own agenda.</p></li>
<li><p>Most people in the world, and I mean literally everyone except maybe a few thousand give up at this point. They try to do &quot;good&quot; (or &quot;bad&quot;) according to their agenda, within the limited scope of their influence. At this level life already is a game, mostly incomprehensible to everyone else. A majority of these people are cloaked to a certain degree, although of course that depends on the means via which they obtained the power. Sometimes the way to power is very public and not much can be hidden. When money and power are visible, they can be taken away, the person can be eliminated or incapacitated. There are dedicated people who are exposed publicly, just like the presidents and prime ministers of countries are in the spotlight when in reality someone else is pulling the strings.</p></li>
<li><p>But there are people who go a step further. They do whatever it takes to realize their (sometimes benevolent, but still ego-driven) goals. They play both sides, multiple sides, so they can always win. They are not afraid to gamble with everything they have, but they gamble wisely, according to calculation. These people are probably almost exclusively psychopaths in addition to the traits above. Everything, literally everything is a tool in their hands. Pedophile monsters are tools for them. Pedophile scare is a tool for them. Terrorism and terrorism scare are tools for them. Every single thing you can imagine. This sub. It&#39;s a tool for injecting and breeding ideas that are supposed to seem &quot;legitimate&quot; and anti-establishment. Used by the establishment as well, as we all know.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Probably just a minority of them are evil in the sadistic sense, or were evil when they started their journey to power. It is virtually impossible to understand their motives, because while they work hard to build trust, they trust noone, confide noone in and ultimately they are capable of playing everyone around them and the world. But only when they benefit. Unlike the psychopaths who inhabit prisons because they do it compulsively.</p>

<p>To be so efficient and effective, they have to control their emotions, impulses, desires and human biases really well (comparatively). They have to be able to suppress sadness and anger, they have to be able to hide happiness and excitement, they have to act in front of others. They have to be as rational in their choices as possible. Which makes them so distant from the rest of humanity that that for most of us they are a form of alien, cryptic intelligence. We may call them lizard people if it&#39;s easier to grasp how vast the gap is.</p>

<p>How to change the status quo? I don&#39;t have a good idea. There&#39;s no guarantee that changing the system would make the world a better place, we&#39;ve never had any other system in place to compare. Maybe it is worth trying to change the world. THEY certainly think so. Do you?</p>

<p>Is your answer a revolution? Destroying everything and building from the ground up? Leaders will emerge. Guess what kind of people they will be. Guess what they&#39;ll need to make it successful while the whole world will be trying to get their slice.</p>

<p>And if you think you really have what it takes to change the world, read this post again, because now it applies to you. You&#39;ll either fail or become one of them.</p>

<p>And if you want another way, you&#39;ll <em>really</em> need to think outside of the box and come up with something that our whole species has never tried. Human nature is very hard to change - it ultimately is the major factor backing the current balance of power.</p>

<p>And then, still <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> will hate you if we know about you. But the sub wouldn&#39;t exist without you ;-) You fucking sneaky lizardman!</p>

<p>Edit: sorry for the typo in the title + list formatting :/</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In the sense that their patterns of thought and reasoning would be alien to most of us, yes, I think that virtually all people at the top are &#39;lizards&#39;. The esotery aspect may be a common way for some of them to cope with the brutal reality. Religion gives people resilience and inner strength to endure hardship, for people dealing with extremes, an extreme kind of religion may be preferred.</p>

<p>It&#39;s also worth remembering that all the traits of a successful power-grabber don&#39;t necessarily imply that one is a 100% reasonable, rational being. They also have their delusions, incorrect beliefs, trends and fashions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand what you are saying, referring to people with offensive socio-economic traits as lizards. However, I would argue that those traits make us human.

    <div class="md"><p>Indeed. Additionally contrary to the vast majority of commenters in the sub, I&#39;m trying to resist the temptation to quickly judge people as wearing black or white hats.</p>

<p>The people in power can separate their ultimate vision from long term strategies and short term tactics. We often assume that we know what the end-game is for people like Soros, Trump, Putin, Clinton and others - but we forget that:</p>

<ul>
<li>these people are not lone masterminds, but just publicly exposed elements of a hidden puzzle</li>
<li>they heavily control and choose which information to expose, deciding what perception to create</li>
<li>it is hard to become &quot;redpilled&quot; or &quot;awoke&quot; when a small group of people is capable of <em>directly shaping reality</em>, I&#39;m 100% sure they&#39;re already strategizing about ways to utilize the group of people who think of themselves as &quot;redpilled&quot;</li>

    <div class="md"><p>a top down world view is incorrect. every society and it&#39;s wealth is built off the back of the smallest contributing individual going up to the largest. we have extremely wealthy (EW), middle (M), extremely poor (EP) and the modern professions: arts, business, industry, law, science, technology, services. the EW exist due to achievement, the EP exist due to lack of achievement. you must balance these two groups against each other, taxation is the classical way to address the problem.</p>

<p>if an imbalance occurs, this is generally what follows:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>M use corrupt politicians to deadlock the process of radical change, keeping the current prosperity in static equilibrium (taxes, inflation, growth). this is called a functioning democracy. the late 20th century early 21st century has seen EW (fronted by technologists) preventing a functioning democracy.</p></li>
<li><p>EW use corrupt politicians to eliminate their tax burden, passing it down to M. M with increased taxes must reduce consumption, which reduces production, which decreases the tax revenue and increased the size of EP.</p></li>
<li><p>EP use corrupt politicians to eliminate EW and recreate society into a utopia.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>we are walking blindly into EP, with another fool&#39;s promise of utopia. i think your biggest weakness is assuming that EW are somehow special. they are highly intelligent (HI) and highly fortune (HF), a combination you would expect eventually to occur. some just inherit their fortune and eventually squander it due to the lack of competitive edge against other HI/HF people. the system fluctuates from equilibrium to war and upheaval as it has done for 6000 years, it is always in a state of change, better to look at civilisation as a train rather than it&#39;s conductor or passengers. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>This however is questionable IMHO. While true in the past, the explosive, exponential growth of technology occurring recently means that soon a single-digit number of people will be able to:</p>

<ul>
<li>destroy the planet (seems to already be the case)</li>
<li>stop any rebellion/resistance (e.g. with a fleet of autonomous armed drones/robots)</li>
<li>enslave the whole world (e.g. by engineering a virus carrying a genetic mutation that will kill everyone if they don&#39;t buy an antidote every 30 days)</li>
</ul>

<p>The problem with extrapolating from the past is that we can never be sure when it&#39;s about to stop working!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>information technology and the modern financial system of international banking is a rubber band waiting to be snapped back.</p>

<p>it&#39;s difficult to imagine a post internet world, but it would&#39;ve been difficult to imagine a post &quot;magnetic tape&quot; world also, until the &quot;laser disc&quot;. the internet is raw sewage, companies like google and facebook make their money through filter and curation algorithms and data collection, the future looks more like a library than a dirty bathroom stall. with self-censorship for the public good, like whispering in a library.</p>

<p>the past will never stop working because it&#39;s human nature (or something else) as a driving force, and you will always have something that is scarce and precious to many and available to few, that&#39;s why systems analysis is so useful. </p>

<p>example: today, the internet is available to many, but the truth is scarce and precious and only a few are in possession of it. </p>

<p>the fear of technology and it&#39;s change upon the world was felt most acutely in the 20th century. i think we&#39;re living in far less transformative times, the cult of the future which has  built up around silicon valley entrepreneurs shows you as much. you build a religion after your god is dead, not while he is still alive or has a future. despite billions of dollars being pumped into technology, by 2020 the current era of computing will be more or less embedded into useful products and automation will lessen the load for billions of people around the world, but that won&#39;t solve basic human problems of power, structure and communication. bribing politicians with money or robotic politicians with electricity and more processing power are not all that different. anything built by a man will inherit his weaknesses and flaws. taper to a peak then a decline and revival towards the end of this century. if anything you&#39;re on the right side of the technological curtain, no reason for the drones to bomb on their side of the wall.</p>

They are manipulative and do not value friendship or human interaction like normal &quot;humans.&quot; Whetherbyou believe the reptilian theory or jot( which I do) I know that the lack of conscience or normal emotion makes these elites excellent at manipulating and tricking people to stay on top. They are calculating and know when to take a gamble. Anyways great post ! Very true and righ on point.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Who looks down on who and lack of compassion, it&#39;s easy to understand why they do what they do.<br/>
You know that phrase &quot;As above so below&quot;, there are a few behaviors we can observe down here like for example who looks down on who. Many people look down on blue collars, peasants, blacks, gays, liberals down on conservatives and vice-versa, r/conspiracy looking down on everyone, all because the other is supposedly more stupid.  People at the top have all that money and are bored so why not play a game, have friends with whom share the game and amass the top scores, currency.<br/>
I&#39;m sure they also think &quot;if someone, 0.001%, truly wants to be free they will manage to be free&quot;, we can see this behavior down here as &quot;if you don&#39;t want to be bullied you&#39;ll fight against it&quot;.<br/>
It&#39;s a game with real stakes, not one of these virtual pieces of shit, if you had the money and boredom you would play too.</p>

<p>I also tend to think that, because one can achieve freedom in many different ways when you think outside of the box.</p>

<p>Becoming a farmer in a remote country is one route, it requires one to sacrifice &quot;the world as you know it&quot;, but it grants freedom of a kind. Some people travel the whole world on no budget, doing random jobs and whatever to get food and a shelter. This also is a kind of freedom.</p>

<p>There is also the freedom of the inner kind, which can also be achieved by some, regardless of what you do and how you live.</p>

<p>From my very personal perspective, the lack of freedom is closely tied with social constraints and expectations imposed by other people. &quot;I do not approve of your freedom&quot; is a sentence rarely spoken, but often meant by people.</p>

<p>Have you noticed that you&#39;re expected to only enjoy the kind of &quot;freedom&quot; that comes with spending money? There are a lot of other solutions available.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That was interesting to read. </p>

<p>However, this is an extremely defeatist position to take and comes in my opinion from a skewed evolutionary perspective of the world. A simplified mechanistic dynamic as well. Worse than that it assumes that the ultimate method to change the world is power, while time after time we have observed science, compassion, philosophy, and even blind rebellion having altered the face of the world, usually in forms more permanent and surely more enduring than the short life of any power-hungry individual. Power is certainly a mover not to be underestimated but it is a tactical not even a strategic one and subservient to higher forces. You will have to question yourself, those power-hungry persons that meet in the secret chambers, time after time, aeon after aeon, what higher demon do they worship in order to accept the continuation of a centuries old scope and goal above themselves? And who set the initial goal? Was he more powerful than them and why do they accept to serve him? </p>

<p>The other large pillar of defence and attack against such opinions are the groups of people that congregate when the natural order and beauty is distorted above a certain threshold deemed acceptable by the consciousness of the people. Lead by people of holy wisdom and divine inclination that are not exclusive, but inclusive, that do not condemn, but forgive, that do not seek but are being sought. A modicum of ourselves that are looking for a world that is not only here, but here as well. </p>

<p>if this is our <em>best</em> bet, I&#39;m worried. Because how many people do you think will unify? And it&#39;s not like there&#39;s a single agenda, each power group have their own.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, but if you look at the bigger picture, you can see that all power groups within this capitalist system share common goals and have similar impact on humanity (a point OP is making).</p>

<p>Unifying doesn&#39;t have to be as difficult as it sounds. </p>

<p>When our collective perspective changes through better understanding (which I personally believe is happening right now at a global level), we make individual changes in our lives that may be somewhat subtle but definitely resonate in our community. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very interesting OP, thank you. But IMO you are discounting the power of unilateral, individual human action. People like Satoshi (bitcoin), Cody Wilson (3D printed gun), Richard Stallman (GNU), Torvalds (Linux), Zimmerman (PGP), etc. have all had a tremendous impact on humanity (and those are only very few and recent examples).</p>

<p>What do they have in common? None had the intention of making an impact, or benefiting in any way - other than personal, internal (and sometimes even anonymous) satisfaction. They just followed their internal drive, they are utmost individualists (a la John Galt).</p>

<p>I think you grant too much importance to &quot;power&quot; (in the traditional sense) because of the way History is taught. See <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/C_S_T/comments/5sgk1p/the_real_conspiracy_of_history_the_biggest_scam/">my post on this subject</a> if you&#39;re interested. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;d like you to be right. But from the examples you gave - yes, these people had great impact on the world. They had some passion and just realized it. But they also had a lot of luck - not only in succeeding in what they intended to create, but also in how the rest of the world reacted to it and embraced it.</p>

<p>My post was discussing the route to guaranteed impact, as opposed to highly luck-based impact. Sure, one spends their life working on something like that, it may turn out that it&#39;s going to change the world. But in most cases one is just dismissed as a weird delusional crackpot hobbyist and literally nothing comes out of it, which is pretty sad.</p>

<p>Myself coming from the tech sector, I have a sense of urgency because I&#39;m seeing the direction in which tech is being utilized through the front window of the train. So I&#39;m discounting the unilateral human action with a lot of randomness in favor of less random ways to achieve change. Hopefully I&#39;m wrong and we still have a lot of time before it&#39;s too late.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree 100%, the examples (and people) I cited are lottery winners.</p>

<p>But that&#39;s actually part of my point - they had never guessed the impact their invention would have - and were probably satisfied once it happened, but originally did it for the sake of doing it (internal satisfaction) rather than pleasing others / getting rich or famous (external satisfaction).</p>

<p>It happens to be the case that most (if not all) meaningful evolutions in human history happened this way. Some would call it luck, others providence. Nature works like this - the beauty/impact of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence">emerged</a> results as a sum of unilateral, stochastic contributions is vastly superior to whatever is planned and organized (however intelligent the planners).</p>

<p>That&#39;s how you change the world in the long term IMO. Do your best to follow your calling, do it only for yourself and for no other purpose than fulfilling your internal drive, and <em>especially</em> don&#39;t focus on the end-result (and what others may think). You cannot control the outcome anyway, so do your best of what is right and trust the universe will leverage it for the greater good (individually speaking the concept of a greater good is evil).</p>

<p>You can only control what you do, not what others do with what you&#39;ve done. The central planners want us to convince organized/centralized action is the only way to move the world. It is perhaps so in the short term, but very very false at any other scale. They hate this truth, so we must keep reminding ourselves of it. And in no case should we try to imitate the uncrearive, parasitical, risible and ridiculous &quot;lizards&quot;.</p>
