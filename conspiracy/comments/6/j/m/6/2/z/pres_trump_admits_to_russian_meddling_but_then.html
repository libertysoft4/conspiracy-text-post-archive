    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve tried to not put too much stock in the looks or acts guilty thing. If he is innocent of everything and being politically slandered, he would definitely act this way regardless. I just don&#39;t see the point of constantly bringing these issues up. There&#39;s a purpose to aligning the terms &quot;collude&quot; and &quot;obstruct&quot; with Obama, basic counter-accusation. Would make more sense if Obama was the leading Trump-Russia cheerleader, but he hasn&#39;t made a single statement tying the two together in deviousness. It does make sense that he appears to support the Russian interference claims only once a lengthy article was written in which the Obama admin looks weak or incompetent. Claiming that this was done with some devious political goal in mind seems absurd though, just convenient spin to feed his base, a specialty. </p>

<p>This is exactly my point. I think he keeps trying to do this over and over while deflecting. Comey testified under oath that Trump came to him to talk about Russian hookers being fake months after the fact. He keeps bringing it up and paying attention to it. </p>

<p>at this point, it&#39;s being shoved down everyone&#39;s throat, so there&#39;s obvious resistance to that narrative. I do think that where there&#39;s smoke there&#39;s sometimes fire....but right now all the media coverage is too much.  It&#39;s burning everyone out</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No fire. Lots of smoke and now they are changing their tune.</p>

<p>At first it was election meddling! Now its Russian ties! Why? b/c they couldnt prove election meddling. DNC wont even turn over their server. (Sidenote how the f is the fbi taking no for an answer? If it was anyone else they would kick in the door and take the server..)</p>

<p>The American people can tell when its a real claim and spin doctoring.</p>

<p>When most of the wealthy democrats have ties to Russia as well people tend to shrug and ask the real issues:</p>

<p>wages, cost of living, cost of housing, jobs, environment.</p>

<p>But the corporate democrats are too busy furthering perpetual war for their donors and using it, they think, as ammo for the next election.</p>

<p>Dore is spot on when he quotes Assange who says the democrat party is dying b/c they are addicted to the money of wall street amongst other reasons.</p>

<p>Russia hacked all the senate and congress where democrats have lost it all?</p>

<p><em>Even if</em> Russia did hack what did they provide? True information.</p>

<p>Those emails were hers, never denied it. So the evil Russia did was provide America with true information? More than Debbie W Shits ever did. Her and her cronies are criminal.</p>

<p>But Russia did none of that. Its propaganda conspiracy theory to dirty Trump and provide impetus for the MIC to continue to rape the citizens tax dollars.</p>
