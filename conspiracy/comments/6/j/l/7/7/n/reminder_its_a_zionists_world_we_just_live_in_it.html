There was a post that took off titled <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/6jbyu1/serious_people_who_have_lived_under_sharia_law/">[Serious] People who have lived under Sharia Law, what was it really?</a>. To no one&#39;s surprise, the post went front page with thousands of upvotes and comments. I decided to make a post titled <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/6jgll5/seriouspeople_who_have_lived_under_zionism_what/">People who have lived under Zionism, what was it really like?</a>. Now, you&#39;d figure, since we feel the effects of Zionism globally everyday much greater than Sharia Law, upvotes and comments would flood in. I waited 45 minutes. What did I get? I got downvoted and garnered one comment and a reply to my comment. That was it. The state of Reddit is a reflection of the planet and WILL get worse before it gets better. </p>

<p>Well, you have to admit that the community of people opposing Zionism does tend to have some overlap with actual antisemites—you know, the kind that deny the Holocaust, think the Protocols of the Elders are real, believe Jews are the source of all greed and corruption, etc. To an outsider, it would be easy to conflate the two camps.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Have you actually examined the so called evidence they used to claim it was a forgery? The clim is based on a loose paraphrase from an earlier work by a guy named Maurice Joly, and Joly himself had plagiarized it from someone else. The existence of that paraphrase only implies that the author likely read Joly&#39;s work, or the work Joly plagiarised. If genuine, the Protocols were never intended for wide publiation. To claim that the paraphrase is proof that the document is a forgery is laughable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>However you look at it, the existence of the paraphrasing of a satirical text puts a pretty big dent in the idea that the Protocols are an actual account of a meeting of Jewish elders. Not to mention the strong resemblances to earlier canards, as well as Goedsche&#39;s novel. If you want to split hairs about this, that&#39;s fine—I&#39;m not trying to stop you. I just think it would be important for you to remember that the world might not be as black and white as you believe it to be.</p>

<p>My point is not to say that there aren&#39;t probably some Jews aiming for world domination, but rather that it isn&#39;t <em>only</em> Jews aiming for world domination. Off the top of my head, the Jesuits and the Rockefeller family come to mind.</p>
