    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s bullshit. Occam&#39;s razor dictates that the simplest solution is usually the right one, in this case it was the human characteristic of Greed. As humanity has grown into adolescence, we have been driven, guided by an unseen hand. The masses have adjusted this into frustration which they have turned upon themselves. Hence, the tyranny of the masses.</p>

<p>Back when there was imperialism we knew who our leaders are. Now the public ascribes leadership to scapegoats. Back before Adam Smith and his &quot;invisible hand&quot; and division of labor, humans would have turned into something different. But we have come so far since then. This future is volatile, hypnotic, and vast. Though one human may not make waves any more the collective spirit of mankind has within it the capacity to survive ourselves. If we only forgive ourselves first though. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You need to differentiate between &quot;simple&quot;, or easily understood or done and presenting no difficulty like a logical and lock-step sequence or progression of facts or events that make perfect sense when they&#39;re taken all together...</p>

<p>and &quot;simplistic&quot; which entails treating a more complex series or progression of facts or events as if they were far simpler and easier to explain than they actually are by deliberately omitting or overlooking any that interfere with or conflict with that explanation if they were all taken together.</p>

<p>It is in that &quot;simple&quot; and not &quot;simplistic&quot; sense that Occam&#39;s axiom was meant to apply, which is not to say that Sherlock Holmes first axiom or law of deduction that &quot;Once you&#39;ve eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, no matter how improbable it is, must be true.&quot; which is also an equally valid and more important one.</p>

<p>According to Holmes who is more specific than Occam you don&#39;t theorize or predict any particular outcome <em>before</em> but rather <em>after</em> you&#39;ve gathered and examined all the facts surrounding any unexplained event and deduced what they indicate has actually happened on that basis. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>But it does account for human nature. If the person had elaborated on their idea of the conspiracy then I would have had a different response. For me, the conspiracy behind 9/11 is the human capacity for greed. How it was accomplished is of course more complex then that. Human nature has been the driving force behind some of the most despicable events and conspiracies in history. Mind you, only some. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was trying to point out that Occam&#39;s razor is all too often used to justify simplistic and inadequate explanations, which is not what it&#39;s purpose is. Actually it&#39;s to more to discourage more imaginative, fanciful, and entertaining ideas some might be drawn to than what the evidence actually suggests in that regard.</p>

<p>But 9/11 and the taking down of the two main towers was actually a textbook Psy-op, timed and designed for maximum psychological impact on the masses that the mass media was very much in on and a part of whether any of those doing the reporting were aware of that and their role in it or not. </p>

<p>They are merely the eyes and ears and feet on the ground being told what to do, where to go, who to question, and what to ask and subsequently tell as they are constantly being cued and informed about what&#39;s happening overall from behind the scenes by higher-ups that they simply respond to.</p>

<p>You had all the tension, suspense and high drama of the plane crashes, fires, people trapped high-up in these smoking towers and first responders all rushing to the rescue and this is not some movie but really happening in New York on what started out as perfectly normal Tuesday morning went right out the window as more and more tuned in to see just exactly what was going on. </p>

<p>People being what they are, they were quite naturally drawn in and stressed out by what they saw. Worried about all they were watching and not a little worried about themselves too. </p>

<p>In short their defences were down as all that was ongoing and had any more time elapsed before the entire scene was unbelievably blown to smithereens destroying everyone and everything they were glued to watching those defences would have shifted back into place to shut down the flow of stress and anxiety and forced them to withdraw and turn away from it; shutting off and shutting down their emotional attachment and distancing themselves from it both psychologically and physically. </p>

<p>Three hours is about the limit for most people facing that kind of emotional stress and tension when they are powerless to do anything about the circumstances but watch them hoping for some kind of relief to appear which is why the buildings had to come down when and how they did before that happened and to great extent the minds of all the onlookers took the full brunt and force of not one but two totally unbelievable collapses they would never in a million years or even in their worst nightmare have ever expected to happen. </p>

<p>Their minds simply locked-up with something that can&#39;t possibly be happening somehow actually happening, suddenly, without any warning and with nothing to conceivably suggest it ever could or would, right before their very eyes.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why everything is so difficult to grasp and why unbelievable explanations proffered by the government have been getting a pass... people don&#39;t know what to believe and they don&#39;t trust themselves and their own judgement as the result of that trauma. To make those matters worse &quot;the truth&quot; that their own government or people in it could do such a thing is too horrible and repulsive. They don&#39;t and won&#39;t and can&#39;t bring themselves to believe it. Give them anything else but that and they&#39;d gladly accept it and it doesn&#39;t need to even be rational or make a whole lot of sense. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The people should already know something was up and fishy about Sandy Hook, the Aurora shooting, and the Boston bombing, in fact any attacks anywhere, London, Paris, Barcelona, whatever, where someone&#39;s government was co-incidentally running a terrorist drill or exercise of some kind when the real thing just <em>coincidentally</em>  happened. </p>

<p>Sorry but coincidences like that don&#39;t just happen they have to be made to happen and that can only be done from the inside and at the planning stage to time them that precisely or copycat the nature of the actual drill itself as far too many of them have.</p>

<p>A better question regarding those drills and exercises is why any first responders like FEMA, police, fire departments and emergency medical staff need any drilling at all. </p>

<p>They all generally work in tandem and are used to quickly assessing all kinds of untoward situations like natural disasters, factory explosions, railway accidents, multiple car crashes, runaway fires, gang wars and shootings and on and on. It&#39;s what they all do for living.</p>

<p>Any terrorist acts are no more out of the ordinary than any of what they must usually contend with. </p>

<p>The actual target for terrorism and terrorist acts are simply members of the general public who aren&#39;t in any way prepared for them nor while money gets wasted on massive drills for people doing what they normally do with virtually the same elements unpredictably involved as they usually are so that they can do the same job that that they always do is ridiculous. </p>

<p>It would make far more sense to prepare and advise the public who may find themselves in or around a terrorist event long before anyone arrives to help that need some fundamental information about how to avoid being one of the casualties those responders are going to scrape off the pavement after it&#39;s already happened. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, it&#39;s because it&#39;s the most tangible piece of the puzzle to attack.  We have lots of data on the collapses that is publicly available.  None of us will know the story of Bin Laden, it just won&#39;t happen.  However, experts can make their assertions on the videos and we can hope that the people involved at NIST will come forward.  It&#39;s just the part that offers the most hope for reconciliation (to the community).  And, can you just understand that a controlled demo performed by the government that killed 3,000 Americans would be the MOST egregious action within the conspiracy.  If they lied about Bin Laden, fine.  It doesn&#39;t change the situation all that much with regards to the general public.  But admitting to Americans that 9/11 had a role performed by our government would shatter the world view of many people in this country.  It would be world changing.  It would have international policy consequences.  It would be arguably the <strong>biggest</strong> deal in the 21st century (so far).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>it is so much more than the invasion of the middle east.</p>

<p>As they sold the middle class to china they needed a slow boil. and all those M.I.C. contractors helped pay the bills while the masses got addicted to every drug there is. All while the elite looted this great country in hopes to relocate to another spot while what is left of America tears itself apart. Divide and conquer is always at play.       Even if all those people that caused all this pain was brought to light.  The Trust for Government will never be restored.   So let the great reset happen already.     Massive Meteor strike we welcome you.   this 80/20 algorithm needs some adjustment. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>US Government? No. The Deep State -- mostly Israel, if you want to put it into a state context, but also Saudi Arabia, Bush family, Zionists, media, and lots of useful idiots. The US govt was punked by, essentially, a big magic trick:</p>

<p><a href="https://apunked.wordpress.com/overview-of-the-evidence/">The Day America Was Punked</a></p>

<p>If it&#39;s any consolation, probably &quot;only&quot; a few hundred died on 9/11. But then thousands more got cancer -- much quieter, more profitable way to kill people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s bullshit. Occam&#39;s razor dictates that the simplest solution is usually the right one, in this case it was the human characteristic of Greed. As humanity has grown into adolescence, we have been driven, guided by an unseen hand. The masses have adjusted this into frustration which they have turned upon themselves. Hence, the tyranny of the masses.</p>

<p>Back when there was imperialism we knew who our leaders are. Now the public ascribes leadership to scapegoats. Back before Adam Smith and his &quot;invisible hand&quot; and division of labor, humans would have turned into something different. But we have come so far since then. This future is volatile, hypnotic, and vast. Though one human may not make waves any more the collective spirit of mankind has within it the capacity to survive ourselves. If we only forgive ourselves first though. </p>
