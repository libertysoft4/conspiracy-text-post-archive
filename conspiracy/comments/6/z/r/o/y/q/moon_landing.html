I personally believe the landing was faked because the US wanted to be the first there in the Space Race. I think we faked it all to just be the first.

    <div class="md"><p>If you look at any narrative in history it&#39;s <em>fake faking the real</em> also known as:</p>

<p><em>winners write the history books</em> </p>

<p>or in the media </p>

<p><em>spin</em> or </p>

<p><em>fake it until you make it</em> or </p>

<p><em>giving the people what they want - (a story)</em>.</p>

<p>The conspiracy followers biggest heel is expecting there to be an easily digestible narrative in the bottom of the rabbit hole. There is, but the very way one thinks needs to be modified to see it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>somewhat agreed- the digestible narrative on an ostensibly discrete event is like looking for a trick shot on a pool table or bad black jack deck when the game being played is actually Go. </p>

<p>the other piece is that organizations get attached to historical narratives for so many different reasons, one of which being that is literally an effort to rework an explanation than just plop something into the preexisting one. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe people do so much proactive conspiring as reactive fitting. That said, something like Jekyll Island is a good example of straight up conspiracy. </p>

<p>So, indigestible is good way to put it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The astronauts are brave AF, because we may have been teleporting to the moon since before they even landed, but they have to go via traditional dangerous means--even if they went up to orbit, they are still grave.  Kubrick being discussed to film moon footage is not a conspiracy, that happened.  The moon studios were set up.      </p>

<p>Also, Neil Armstrong makes a case for it never happening because of his actions.  Here&#39;s a guy who should be the hero of the world.  Wherever he goes. But he becomes a hermit, staying out of the limelight entirely.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>ultimately it&#39;s not about the hoax.  it&#39;s about how, if you&#39;ve been taught something your whole life, how can you go against it and discover truth?  The answer is to be fearless.  Yesterday was 9/11, and boy did i happen to casually mention to a friend that the media indoctrinates us from birth with their version of truth.  He disagreed. I mentioned wtc7.  He had never heard of it.  He then told me that to be associated as a conspiracy theorist is one of the worst things a person can be.  It disgusted him.  I showed him building 7 videos, but he got angrier and angrier about how conspiracy theorists are just the worse kind of fucking losers.  Bart Sibrel and Moonraker on youtube, in my opinion have unequivocally proven the moon landing to be faked.  And yet, people hate them, they have been blacklisted, called losers with no life, and the real reason why, is because people can&#39;t go against MSM. It hurts their pride too much.  Pride = Fear.  To become fearless, first we have to be authentic.  Each layer of the onion of pride must be peeled back slowly</p>
