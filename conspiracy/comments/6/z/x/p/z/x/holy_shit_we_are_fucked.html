    <div class="md"><p>Same here, folks. </p>

<p>But, it&#39;s hard not to feel the pressure of a lot of folks talking about it. I feel for the simple fact that it&#39;s brought up so much, gives it some credibility ... but, so did the rest of those dates. 2012 for example ... but then again, apparently we got &quot;shifted&quot; during that time and avoided it. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not one to freak out over doomsday, cause whats the point - you&#39;re here the next day or not. </p>

<p>Since all the Sept 23rd stuff is popping up - where is it originating from exactly?! It kinda just started coming on to my radar last year</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh I have, haha. And trust me ... would love to believe that a lot of us are able to see through the BS and know what&#39;s really going on out there.</p>

<p>But, as the others, there was this and that to &quot;show&quot; that this time is real. </p>

<p>I for one have watched about 500 videos or more on the whole Nibiru thing, including recent sightings, space photos, infared videos, etc, and I agree something is strange... but i can&#39;t know for sure. </p>

<p>Do you know where it all started?! I see some folks saying it&#39;s bible related as well as amateur/professional researchers talking about it. Just curious how sept 23rd was settled upon initially? Maybe a leak of an estimated timeframe?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Somewhat bible related, if you are into that. The bible is just copies of older religions, that tell the same tale. The 23 is because thats when the allignment of stars and planets are perfect. Then Nibiru can be born or whatever. If i remember correcly, the last time they lined up like that was some 7000 years ago, but that could be completely wrong.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not overly into the bible stuff, for those reasons. </p>

<p>But, the alignment of the stars, and planets ... that&#39;s interesting to me. I have read that ancient cultures have written and spoke of this stuff, and it&#39;s been much the same conversation/message that we are chatting about now. </p>

<p>I&#39;m with you ... the internet/TPTB have done a great job and throwing so much info out on every single topic, that sometimes it&#39;s hard to know what&#39;s coming vs what isnt. </p>

<p>Someone saying it&#39;s a definite no is just as bad as saying it&#39;s a definite yes. We&#39;re both reading 2nd hand info given to us, and for someone to stand on one side of the fence saying theyre right, is silly to me, since I don&#39;t see much of a difference. </p>

<p>I hope you wake up on the 24th as well and get to have a laugh. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Acient culture is something you should dive into right away. That is so incredibly interesting, and when you see all the amazing things around the world, hidden from mainstream eyes.. mind boggling! up untill recently I thought the Giza pyramide and the mayan civilization were the only thing of value. There are major cities and vast structures being uncovered all the time, and one thing i can say for sure, the acients were at least as knowledgeable as us, if not more. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>haha, I agree. Years ago I touched base on it a little - but that was due to some of the 2012 stuff being said - which came and passed - unless it didn&#39;t, and the whole reality is a much stranger thing than we think - which, I&#39;m down with .... I see some shit every day that boggles my mind at times haha. </p>

<p>I bet there is a great thread linking all this stuff together on some corner of the internet - like the ancients talking and writing of this stuff, plus the signs they spoke of, plus modern proof ... I&#39;m into the whole Nibiru thing ... not sure why scientists would announce it, and then &quot;take it back&quot;. I feel some of this stuff is just too coincidental. </p>

<p>Have anything interesting for me to read in regards to this thread topic?! </p>

<p>Thanks for the good chats. I love a good chat back and forth, regardless of the view you may hold ... I feel thats what this place should be for. We could probably figure out a whole bunch more if we didn&#39;t spend the time here saying one another is stupid for believing one thing over another ... as most things are possible, and all of the 2nd hand info is just that ... it&#39;s just obvious you&#39;ll find more proof if they&#39;re writing the proof to fit the lie.</p>

<p>Is it Nibiru or acient history you want? I havent been down the Nibiru road in a while, figured i shouldnt wrap my head to much around that. At least not so long before the 23. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do a quick google search of &quot;2025 apocalypse&quot;</p>

<p>I have psychic abilities and I further researched them . What I do know is this is the year the government will establish full capabilities of their mind control programs and aswell as their weather machines . No doomsday revelations have came true up to this point obviously . But as crazy as it sounds ; I am going off all the information of classified documents I have read and linked together.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>haha, I agree. Years ago I touched base on it a little - but that was due to some of the 2012 stuff being said - which came and passed - unless it didn&#39;t, and the whole reality is a much stranger thing than we think - which, I&#39;m down with .... I see some shit every day that boggles my mind at times haha. </p>

<p>I bet there is a great thread linking all this stuff together on some corner of the internet - like the ancients talking and writing of this stuff, plus the signs they spoke of, plus modern proof ... I&#39;m into the whole Nibiru thing ... not sure why scientists would announce it, and then &quot;take it back&quot;. I feel some of this stuff is just too coincidental. </p>

<p>Have anything interesting for me to read in regards to this thread topic?! </p>

<p>Thanks for the good chats. I love a good chat back and forth, regardless of the view you may hold ... I feel thats what this place should be for. We could probably figure out a whole bunch more if we didn&#39;t spend the time here saying one another is stupid for believing one thing over another ... as most things are possible, and all of the 2nd hand info is just that ... it&#39;s just obvious you&#39;ll find more proof if they&#39;re writing the proof to fit the lie.</p>
