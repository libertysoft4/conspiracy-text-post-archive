<p>What follows is the original article I wrote when the news story first broke regarding the existence of a system to tap into any phone in America built into the surveillance system used by law enforcement authorities. Several cases were cited where investigations ranging from drug running and money laundering to the events of 9/11 had been compromised by leaks from the company that operated the phone taps as well as phone data from an associated company that handles billing services for almost every phone in America.
The focus of the article was a single question. Could Israel be blackmailing the entire US Government and media.</p>

<p>The answer is now obvious. Fox News, the so-called &quot;We report, you decide&quot; all news network, has removed the four part story from their website. No explanation is given except for the single Orwellian sentence at the end of one of the links, &quot; <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,40684,00.html">http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,40684,00.html</a> - This story no longer exists &quot;.</p>

<p>Israel, purportedly our friend, has been spying on us all. And we&#39;re not talking about individual spooks like Jonathan Pollard, or small-time networks such as the <a href="http://www.americanfreepress.net/03_10_02/Massive_Spy_Ring/massive_spy_ring.html">http://www.americanfreepress.net/03_10_02/Massive_Spy_Ring/massive_spy_ring.html</a> - 140 Israelis arrested by the FBI prior to 9/11 , or the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&amp;amp;contentId=A3879-2001Nov22&amp;amp;notFound=true">http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&amp;amp;contentId=A3879-2001Nov22&amp;amp;notFound=true</a> - 60 arrested since (including <a href="http://www.whatreallyhappened.com/fiveisraelis.html">http://www.whatreallyhappened.com/fiveisraelis.html</a> - 5 arrested who were cheering and celebrating as the World Trade Towers collapsed ).</p>

<p>It turns out that Israel has had a potential wiretap on every phone in America for years, along with the ability to monitor and record who any person is calling, anywhere in America; information of great value even if one does not listen to the calls themselves. Amdocs, Inc. the company which sub contracts billing and directory services for phone companies around the world, including 90 percent of American phone companies, is owned by Israeli interests. Yet another company, <a href="http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article6480.htm">http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article6480.htm</a> - Comverse Infosys, is suspected of having built a &quot;back door&quot; into the equipment permanently installed into the phone system that allows instant eavesdropping by law enforcement agencies on any phone in America. This includes yours.</p>

<p>Concerns about allowing an Israeli company such intimate access to the infrastructure go back many years. As reported by <a href="http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article5133.htm">http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article5133.htm</a> - Fox News , the Israeli company Amdocs was implicated in the leaking of police phone data that resulted in the collapse of on investigation into a massive drug and credit card fraud operation with Israeli connections.</p>

<p>In a telling repeat of the Los Angeles drug case, <a href="http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article7544.htm">http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article7544.htm</a> - investigators looking into the attacks on the World Trade Towers are again reporting that confidential telephone information is again being leaked in a manner that is interfering with the investigations. Again, Amdocs was implicated.</p>

<p>Not content with the phones of ordinary citizens in the United States, <a href="http://www.washington-report.org/backissues/062000/0006006.html">http://www.washington-report.org/backissues/062000/0006006.html</a> - evidence has surfaced that Israel compromised the telephone systems at the highest levels of the US Government.</p>

<p>Now, I want you all to stop and think for a minute of the full ramifications of this. Israeli interests have the ability to listen in on ANY phone in America connected to any of the systems used by Amdocs or Comverse Infosys. They have had this ability for several years. They can listen in and track the phone calls made by anyone&#39;s phone, whether police officer, elected official, media talking head, editor, policy setter, news mogul, even the President of the United States. The Ken Starr report on Whitewater describes how Bill Clinton warned Monica Lewinsky that a foreign government was tapping their phone calls.</p>

<p>Few indeed are the people in America who do not have something to hide. That insider trade, the brief but torrid affair, the stolen votes, the deliberate smear, the role one played in an assassination, the acceptance of money from drug runners to look the other way. Be honest. Is there a skeleton in your closet you hope will stay there? Something nobody knows about? Well, if that skeleton involved a phone call, someone may know about it. Amdocs and Comverse Infosys. And their Israeli owners.</p>

<p>Just think about it for a moment. Everyone&#39;s private phone traffic, right up to the President, potentially visible to Israeli interests. And you cannot find the phone taps or bugs because they are built right into the phone system!</p>

<p>Suddenly, a lot of events which have puzzled observers start to make sense.</p>

<p>Like the way the US vetoed the UN resolution calling for peace in Palestine, despite being the only 1 out of 15 voting nations to have voted against the measure. The USA gained nothing by this veto. But Israel did.</p>

<p>Over the last few weeks, the people of the United States have seen a great deal of evidence pointing the finger of blame for 9/11 at Osama bin Laden and Arabs in general, evidence which is circumstantial, often self-contradictory, and in some cases faked. Yet as was <a href="http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article7545.htm">http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article7545.htm</a> - reported in the news, evidence also exists linking many of the arrested Israeli spies (some of whom worked for the Israeli telecom companies above) with the events of 9/11. Yet this evidence is NOT being broadcast endlessly on the news. In fact, this evidence is CLASSIFIED. Someone has &quot;persuaded&quot; the US Government and the media that the American people are ONLY supposed to see the evidence that points a certain direction, and must never see any evidence that points someplace else. Likewise, the media has been &quot;persuaded&quot; not to report <a href="http://www.antiwar.com/justin/j121401.html">http://www.antiwar.com/justin/j121401.html</a> - evidence that Israel knew of the 9/11 attacks ahead of time . The <a href="http://www.paknews.org.pk/main.php?id=7&amp;amp;date1=2001-11-04">http://www.paknews.org.pk/main.php?id=7&amp;amp;date1=2001-11-04</a> - foreign press has outright accused the Mossad of taking part in the 9/11 attacks but the American media have been &quot;persuaded&quot; not to cover these accusations.</p>

<p>It was well known that there was an Israeli spy <a href="http://www.rense.com/general18/esp.htm">http://www.rense.com/general18/esp.htm</a> - inside the Clinton White House . But Clinton ordered the FBI to cease searching for the mole, code-named &quot;Mega&quot;. It is now known that &quot;Mega&quot; <a href="http://www.larouchepub.com/other/2001/2833mega_spy.html">http://www.larouchepub.com/other/2001/2833mega_spy.html</a> - was not just Mossad spy but top Mossad agent in America . The cancellation of the hunt for &quot;Mega&quot; occurred at the same time Clinton warned Monica Lewinsky that their phone conversations were being recorded. This strongly suggests that Clinton was &quot;persuaded&quot; to call off the FBI&#39;s hunt for &quot;Mega&quot; with the threat of a recorded phone sex session being made public.</p>

<p>Because of the purported links between Muslims and the attacks on the World Trade Towers, the US Government has been shutting down all Muslin linked charities in the USA. But the <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,40693,00.html">http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,40693,00.html</a> - Chairman of the Jewish Defense League, a group with a violent history, was arrested recently in a plot to bomb a US congressman. But the US Government has been &quot;persuaded&quot; not to take actions against Jewish charities, while the media has been &quot;persuaded&quot; to allow the story of hard evidence of JDL terrorism to fade away as quickly as possible.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.whatreallyhappened.com/mex.html">http://www.whatreallyhappened.com/mex.html</a> - Two Mossad agents were arrested with dynamite inside the Mexican Congress.</p>
