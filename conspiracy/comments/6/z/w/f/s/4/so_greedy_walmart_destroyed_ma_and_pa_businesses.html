        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>To top it all off, one look out the window and anyone can see endless nationwide corporations planted all over the place taking up valuable real estate where Ma and Pa shops used to be. </p>

<p>Some examples are McDonald&#39;s, Burger King, Best Buy, Taco Bell, Verizon, etc..</p>

<p>What a fucking joke. They took all of the business from the 99% and gave it to the 1%. Then they wonder why the top 20 richest people have more wealth than half of the world&#39;s population. The people who don&#39;t need the money are scrambling to take over all the Ma and Pa businesses without a care in the world. </p>

<p>Then dumb asses like Bush say that these Big Businesses need more money so they can hire the Ma and Pa shop employees who are now broke and need a job. So he, and others, lower taxes on these filthy rich claiming the trickle down effect will solve all of our problems while knowing damn well that it will increase the income gap. </p>

<p>Then they (i.e. Obama) spend our tax dollars on shit like funding ISIS and paying Rothschild for so graciously printing our money and lending it to us at high interest rates. Hell, we are barely covering the interest rate on Rothschilds Federal Reserve bills. All those tax dollars are going to the people who don&#39;t even need it like Rothschild and billionaire arms manufacturers. </p>

<p>These same people consider themselves to be above the law and so they do every vile thing imaginable (pedophelia, cannabalism, human sacrifices, organ harvesting, prostitution, etc..).</p>

<p>When we complain, they tell us to write our congressmen and everything will be OK knowing damn well the Congressmen don&#39;t give a shit about our letters. They probabaly don&#39;t even read them personally. </p>

<p>Most of the US government is guilty of treason and sabatoge. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think step 1 should be ending taxes. We, the people, would end them so that more money floats in the economy. I don&#39;t like funding terrorists or cops who steal any loose cash they find on citizens. </p>

<p>2nd, we should all try our best to shop and Ma and Pa shops. The problem is these corporations are enourmous and have hoards of money but by giving our money to Ma and Pa shops, we are keeping our money in the general 99% pool who will end up spending it instead of hoarding it like the corporations do. </p>

<p>If you want to tell people to stop paying taxes, who will fund the prisons that you will be inevitably sent to? We don&#39;t have to take the offensive against the government because we will never win that way. There are countries (eg. Sweden,Denmark) where over 50% of their income is taxed, but their country is among the happiest. The problem isn&#39;t the government taxing us, it&#39;s necessary for societal progress in the forms of welfare, education, infrastructure, etc. The problem is when the government uses the tax money for the wrong reasons. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll have to use batman as an example here but batman, a character that defies all odds, always says &quot;There is always a way&quot;.  This is optimist. There is always a way is a true statement.  </p>

<p>Pessimists usually think of a complex problem and when they are unable to resolve it quickly, they simply give up deeming it impossible. What they don&#39;t realize is that there is a way to solve the problem but they simply don&#39;t know the solution yet. Instead of working towards a solution, they simply give up and deem the problem to be unsolvable. </p>

<p>I was trained to be an optimist in the military like many others. It takes trial and error to become an optimist. Belief is the most important step. Pessimists often give up before even trying because they simply dont belive things are possible. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Where I live in Canada if a small business can&#39;t make $250,000-$500,000 per year they deem it not worth the effort. I have seen numerous small businesses go under by refusing to be competitive and gouging with ridiculous costs. I recently renovated a kitchen using Ikea for $7500 The closest small business was $12,000. Now it took a little longer and I had to do the work but the quality of Ikeas product was better. If I wanted equal quality the quotes where closer to $20,000 which is ridiculous for a small kitchen. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually I DO now what I&#39;m talking about because I&#39;ve done 3 kitchens, one by a outfit one by a friend and one by myself so I know the time and cost and a coworker went to Ikea for the identical kitchen I had and the install was more than the product. And if the job is prepped and you know what you are doing it is only 6-8 to install cabinets. I think you should quit while you are behind. I can tell by your rhetoric you have NEVER installed anything except maybe plugging in a video game controller!</p>

<p>This is exactly what I do but I find with most I don&#39;t need a coupon or anything, the shipping is just free. I also usually get it in just a few days but with Amazon, since I don&#39;t have prime, it takes a week just to leave their warehouse. </p>

<p>Complaining over and over again isnt going to fix the problem though, post solutions.  Example: create anopther jet to squeeze in on amazon&#39;s and walmart&#39;s profits</p>

<p>Teach people alternatives and show them how to get 0% taxes or how infrastructure projects could increase everyone&#39;s lifestyle to that of a millionaire within several years quite trivially</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s the thing though. When a local business does try to compete, they do well. Where I live, two locally owned grocery stores have managed to run Kroger, Albertson&#39;s, Brookshires and Safeway out of town, and have split the local market between themselves. The closest Wal-Mart Supercenter is miles away and on the other side of the interstate in order to not conflict, and even stopped price matching long before they did company wide recently. </p>

<p>Their prices aren&#39;t really as competitive, but they offer fresh, custom cut meat and fresh local produce. They consider Wal-Mart a non-issue. Too many of these mom and pop shops that are being oppressed by big bad Wal-Mart are trying to mark their products at triple Wal-Mart retail and expecting you to hunt down whatever place they stocked it, and they&#39;re not intending on helping you look for it.</p>

In inclement weather situations, they frequently sell out of milk and bread well before the Wal-Mart. I&#39;ve seen them selling Wal-Mart product before ice storms because they ran through their stock and went over and bought unsold Wal-Mart merchandise.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Someone needs to start a corporation, and then give away free stock to those that qualify. The corporation could do it all. It could manufacture everything, and provide every service imaginable. The only thing necessary is that the people who are the first to join are excellent in their trade or skills. The main corporation holds 51% of the stock, meaning it is in control, and the other 49% is broken up into small companies whose owners have served their dues by working as &quot;apprentices&quot;. Once they have served their apprenticeship they are given ownership of their new small business. They own 49%, while the main corporation owns 51%. The little business owner must follow strict guidelines and regulations to keep the business honest and competitive. There is more to this, but this idea could put all those large corporations out of business.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The issue with this is that you are basically arguing against the very idea of capitalism. When business is made to be more efficient and cheaper the consumers benefit and the need for a strong workforce diminish. This workforce is now displaced, but it opens up room for them to go to another area of the economy that could use more attention.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure people are happy to use Amazon over having to 15 dollars for relatively cheap orders that shouldn&#39;t require such a high shipping price.</p>

<p>Of course the displacement is uncomfortable, but technology brings jobs and destroys them. It may of given you walmart, amazon, and netflix which kills small business, yet it has also given you call centers, information technology support, computer repair, and factories (which displaced a lot of skilled labor I might add). </p>

<p>Pessimists usually think of a complex problem and when they are unable to resolve it quickly, they simply give up deeming it impossible. What they don&#39;t realize is that there is a way to solve the problem but they simply don&#39;t know the solution yet. Instead of working towards a solution, they simply give up and deem the problem to be unsolvable. </p>

<p>I was trained to be an optimist in the military like many others. It takes trial and error to become an optimist. Belief is the most important step. Pessimists often give up before even trying because they simply dont belive things are possible. </p>
