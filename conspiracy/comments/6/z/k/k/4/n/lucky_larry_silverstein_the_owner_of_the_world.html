        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Larry Silverstein is the New York property tycoon who purchased the entire WTC complex just 6 months prior to the 9/11 attacks. That was the first time in its 33-year history the complex had EVER changed ownership. </p>

<p>Mr. Silverstein’s first order of business as the new owner was to change the company responsible for the security of the complex. The new security company he hired was Securacom (now Stratasec). George W. Bush&#39;s brother, Marvin Bush, was on its board of directors, and Marvin’s cousin, Wirt Walker III, was its CEO. According to public records, not only did Securacom provide electronic security for the World Trade Center, it also covered Dulles International Airport and United Airlines — two key players in the 9/11 attacks. </p>

<p>The company was backed by an investment firm, the Kuwait-American Corp., also linked for many years to the Bush family. KuwAm has been linked to the Bush family financially since the Gulf War. One of its principals and a member of the Kuwaiti royal family, Mishal Yousef Saud al Sabah, served on the board of Stratesec. </p>

<p>Now, consider: The members of a small cabal owned the WTC complex, controlled its electronic security, and also controlled the security not only for one of the airlines whose aircraft were hijacked on 9/11, but the airport from which they originated. </p>

<p>Another little “coincidence” -- Mr. Silversten, who made a down-payment of $124 million on this $3.2 billion complex, promptly insured it for $7 Billion. Not only that, he covered the complex against “terrorist attacks”. </p>

<p>Following the attacks, Silverstein filed TWO insurance claims for the maximum amount of the policy ($7B), based on the two -- in Silverstein&#39;s view -- separate attacks. The insurance company, Swiss Re, paid Mr. Silverstein $4.6 Billion — a princely return on a relatively paltry investment of $124 million. </p>

<p>There’s more. You see, the World Trade Towers were not the real estate plum we are led to believe. From an economic standpoint, the trade center -- subsidized since its inception by the NY Port Authority -- has never functioned, nor was it intended to function, unprotected in the rough-and-tumble real estate marketplace. How could Silverstein Group have been ignorant of this? </p>

<p>The towers required some $200 million in renovations and improvements, most of which related to removal and replacement of building materials declared to be health hazards in the years since the towers were built. It was well-known by the city of New York that the WTC was an asbestos bombshell. For years, the Port Authority treated the building like an aging dinosaur, attempting on several occasions to get permits to demolish the building for liability reasons, but being turned down due the known asbestos problem. Further, it was well-known the only reason the building was still standing until 9/11 was because it was too costly to disassemble the twin towers floor by floor since the Port Authority was prohibited legally from demolishing the buildings. </p>

<p>The projected cost to disassemble the towers: $15 Billion. Just the scaffolding for the operation was estimated at $2.4 Billion! </p>

<p>In other words, the Twin Towers were condemned structures. How convenient that an unexpected “terrorist” attack demolished the buildings completely. </p>

<p>WTC Building 7 was a part of the WTC complex, and covered under the same insurance policy. This 47-storey steel-framed structure, which was NOT struck by an aircraft, mysteriously collapsed 8 hours later that same day into its own footprint at freefall speed — exactly in the manner of the Twin Towers. </p>

<p>How could this have happened? Mr. Silverstein gave the world the answer when he slipped up during a PBS television interview a year later, on 9/11/2002: </p>

<p>&quot;I remember getting a call from the...er...fire department commander, telling me that they were not sure they were gonna be able to contain the fire, and I said, &#39;We&#39;ve had such terrible loss of life, maybe the smartest thing to do is pull it.&#39; And they made that decision to pull and we watched the building collapse.&quot; </p>

<p>As anyone who knows anything about construction can tell you, “Pull” is common industry jargon for a controlled demolition. </p>

<p>One thing is for sure, the decision to &#39;pull&#39; WTC 7 would have delighted many people. Especially because it has been reported that thousands of sensitive files relating to some of the biggest financial scams in history — including Enron and WorldCom -- were stored in the offices of some of the building’s tenants:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK, so the BBC, a left-leaning publicly funded broadcaster was read in on the timetable of events but announced the Tower 7 collapse before it happened, thereby blowing open the whole conspiracy. If the BBC was read in then presumably the major broadcasters from other countries were read in and could all be trusted to stick to the story - TF1, ARD, Rai Uno, NHK etc... </p>

<p>Or,</p>

<p>Given the FDNY was saying the tower was going to fall and they pulled all their people out hours before it actually happened, the BBC heard of this and on a day of unparalleled chaos and confusion in modern history, they mis-reported that the tower had already fallen.</p>

<p>Which is more likely?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It also wasn&#39;t insured for &quot;terrorist attacks&quot;, that wasn&#39;t even a type of coverage you could get if you wanted then. The attack was covered under the regular policy as just an unforeseen circumstance. He had to pay off the loan still now (which is why he was required to get insurance. When you borrow for a car/house/etc you have to have insurance. It&#39;s not nefarious that he got insurance, it&#39;s what the bank requires you to do).  The lease with the port authority said he had to have a building there in order to maintain control, so he was going to have to rebuild (est. to be 4-7 billion). He also had to keep paying rent to the port authority, even though there was no building. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a completely sane legal strategy to say it was 2 events and go for as much as you can to pay all that off. He still ended having to give the building up back to the port authority. Idk if he made any money in the end. He owned other building in the WTC for a while and they had other policies. He didn&#39;t just take a multi-billion dollar insurance payment and walk away though, that&#39;s for sure.</p>

<p>People also never seem to know that the insurance policy <em>wasn&#39;t even signed and finalized yet</em> He was undercovered but Swiss Re wouldn&#39;t give him anymore coverage so they hadn&#39;t agreed to final numbers yet. Swiss Re told the court they&#39;d honor the original deal they were willing to give out of simple good faith. Larry could of received NOTHING! if not for Swiss Re being nice!</p>

<p>So the poor guy <em>only netted $1.424B.</em> Doesn&#39;t do anything to diminish the story and it is still a princely sum. But you are so accurate and comprehensive with the rest of the story, that it doesn&#39;t make sense to skip this detail.</p>

<p>NYpost <a href="http://nypost.com/2014/04/09/watchdog-sues-port-authority-over-7-7b-rebuild-of-wtc/">article</a> from 2014 regarding WTC rebuild problems.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A Silverstein spokesman said of the $4.5 billion in insurance money awarded to the developer “$3 billion went directly to the Port Authority, including$1.5 billion in rent since 9/11, and another $1.5 billion for the PA-controlled redevelopment of WTC towers 1, 5 and retail space.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I cant seem to find information on the loan repayment. It may be tied up in the redevelopment deal? </p>

<p>Its estimated that he made about 500 million for himself, as WTC7 was owned and insured on a seperate policy for about 800 million.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The initial investment was between Silverstein Group and two other investors, operating under Westfield Group. They split the 124M, 16 of which was Silverstein own personal money. They would pay little upfront increasing their lease payments, also incurring a mandated renovation cost of estimated 200M. The buildings got destroyed, he rebuilt with a brilliant new attention getting building. The insurance settlement he received years later will more than pay for the complete cost of the lease, which was 99 years. The building will operate on pure profit from the moment it was complete for the 80+ years remaining on his lease. I&#39;d say the final profit will be much greater than the insurance settlement. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>First note: Silverstein didnt buy anything. He acquired the lease on WTC. Second, He is just the managing member of the group, not even the largest investor (by a long shot). Third, he insured the buildings againt &quot;terrorism&quot;  Hmmmmmmmm maybe there was a history of trying to blow up the building in the past? Weird that he got paid out? He Used the fund to REBUILD. I believe there is a ton unknown about 9/11 and much being withheld, but cmon, use common sense. Also-Securuicom had been &quot;handling&quot; security at WTC since like 1997, well before silverstein took the lease. By &quot;handling security&quot; i mean they sold some equipment as a vendor to Kroll security who actually managed security post 1993 bombing.</p>

<p>You know, the neoconservative think tank literally founded by Dick Cheney? Which has stated a desire for regime change in Iraq since Bill Clinton was president? And which stated in a report that it would take a Pearl Harbor like event to galvanize the American people to action? </p>

<p>All this Larry Silverstein shit seems like a distraction from the actual architects of this event. It makes more sense to put a patsy in as owner rather than tie the name of any of the actual planners to the building, and I&#39;m sure the billions in hush money didn&#39;t hurt this plan. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying Silverstein wasn&#39;t involved, so nobody come at me with that strawman shit. I&#39;m saying that it&#39;s stupid to focus on him over the people who literally hoped for a new Pearl Harbor and just happened to get everything they ever wanted when they literally assumed the presidency. Just look at all the Bush administration people affiliated with PNAC. His fucking brother (Jeb, not Marvin) was signatory to its Statement of Principles...</p>

<p>Some things that don&#39;t make sense:</p>

<p>Larry Silverstein, the wealthy property owner and developer who held the lease on the World Trade Center properties, was due to work that morning of September 11, 2001, in the temporary offices of his company, Silverstein Properties, on the 88th floor of the North Tower. But he had a problem; he had a dermatologist appointment that morning, too. According to Silverstein, his wife “laid down the law” and told him he could not miss the doctors appointment. Therefore, Silverstein was not at the World Trade Center when the planes hit. Two of Silverstein’s children, his son, Roger, and daughter, Lisa, would regularly attend meetings with important clients at Windows on the World. That morning, they too were running late and were not at Windows when the planes hit. All three Silverstein’s survived, leading conspiracy theorists to assume that they had advance knowledge of the attacks and deliberately stayed away from the WTC buildings that day. Silverstein did lose four employees in the attack; two of them had just been hired.</p>
