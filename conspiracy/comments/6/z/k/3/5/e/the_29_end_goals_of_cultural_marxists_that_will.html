        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Who are these cultural marxists I am talking about? You may have guessed it, it is the Social Justice Warriors.</p>

<p>The liberal arts and the Democrat party are infested with SJW&#39;s, who are a subgroup of radical feminists that have emerged over the last 10 years. SJW&#39;s have embolden terrible people like Crooked Hillary to weaponize identity politics. Bernie Sanders (as insane as his ideas are) is not an evil man and had reasonable criticisms of her. That made him an evil misogynist for daring to question Hillary since she is a strong womyn. Thankfully the public is mostly sane and humiliated her on November 8th, 2016, but this is not last hurrah of the SJW&#39;s. They will be back in 2020, with new SJW candidates. And if we allow Democrats to gain control of the presidency and both chambers of congress, do not be surprised to see the following occur:</p>

<ul>
<li>Draconian hate speech laws come into effect immediately - this will be key to implementing the rest of the agenda</li>
<li>Questioning a woman on anything she says will be considered misogynist as it is mansplaining and will be considered hate speech and punishable by law</li>
<li>If a woman thinks you looked at her for too long, you will be in legal trouble as that will be termed sexual assault</li>
<li>Fascist and Nazi ideologies will be banned, and this will be convenient as anyone who opposes the Democratic party will be considered a Nazi or a fascist</li>
<li>Opposing a political candidates positions in a way that could trigger someone will be considered hate speech and punishable by law</li>
<li>The court systems will lower the evidence threshold of rape cases to &quot;preponderance of evidence&quot; standards, establishing Kangaroo Courts for those men accused of rape</li>
<li>If a man and a woman have sex, and the woman has any alcohol in her system, it will be considered rape. Even if her BAC is .02 and his is .20</li>
<li>Turning down advances from an overweight woman or a transgender women will be considered bigoted if done for the &quot;wrong reasons&quot;, and will be considered hate speech and be punishable by law</li>
<li>&quot;Checking your privilege&quot; classes will become mandatory for all boys in K-12</li>
<li>Opposing abortion under any circumstances will be considered hate speech and punishable by law</li>
<li>Doctors will be threatened with loss of their medical license, lawsuits, and prison time if they treat obesity as a health problem</li>
<li>Doctors will be threatened with loss of their medical license, lawsuits, and prison time if they acknowledge someone&#39;s biological sex at birth</li>
<li>The military will be drastically cut back, NATO will collapse, and America and its allies will be invaded in under 20 years.</li>
<li>It will be considered homophobic if you don&#39;t at some point in your life entertain the idea that you might be gay, and try kissing someone of the same sex</li>
<li>Sports networks like ESPN will be mandated by law to cover female sporting events equally to male sporting events (for example, the WNBA would receive equivalent coverage to the NBA)</li>
<li>Calling a woman a derogatory word such as &quot;slut&quot; will be a hate crime and could lead to prison time</li>
<li>In addition to the Sex Offender Registry, there will be a Bigot Registry for those convicted under hate speech laws</li>
<li>Companies will be mandated by law to have at least 50% of their managerial staff be women, regardless of the industry and how many women are employed in that industry</li>
<li>It will be considered hate speech for a man to indicate preferences for his ideal woman&#39;s body type (shaven or unshaven legs, butt size, long or short hair, thin or overweight, etc.)</li>
<li>If a man and a woman are in a relationship and she decides that she wants to open up the relationship, it wil be considered polyphobic for the man to then break up with her and will be considered punishable by law</li>
<li>In the textbooks for our children, history becomes herstory and woman becomes womyn</li>
<li>Men will be assigned a 23% male privilege tax to overcome the &quot;wage gap&quot;</li>
<li>Girls opposing those born men on their sports teams who are not taking estrogen will be publicly shamed and humiliated</li>
<li>Microaggressions will be considered hate speech and could lead to legal trouble</li>
<li>Owning a gun will be considered a microaggression</li>
<li>Fleshlights and sex robots will be criminalized and if a man purchases such an item he will be convicted of rape</li>
<li>Men who dislike the idea of those born women in their locker rooms showcasing female body parts will be guilty of hate speech and be in legal trouble</li>
<li>Women who dislike the idea of those born men in their locker rooms showcasing male body parts will be guilty of hate speech and be in legal trouble</li>
<li> If a woman or an LGBT person assaults you, it will be considered justified if you committed a microagression that &quot;triggered&quot; them</li>
</ul>

<p>These policies will be used to help usher in world government, which will cement these policies for eternity. We must not let this happen.</p>

<p>My wife is Mexican. I agree with AJ and this video makes me love AJ more. I am against illegal immigration and all illegal immigrants must go ASAP but we love our legal immigrants and we care not about what color the people who are here legally are. The video title is racist bait for the leftist alt-right. I see you are a Richard Spencer fanboy, very sad indeed. You are a tool of Soros, nothing more. Racism is leftist thinking.</p>
