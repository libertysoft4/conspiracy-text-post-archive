<p><em>September 10, 2017 @ 18:50 UTC</em></p>

<p>Okay... how about a major X8.2 solar flare for a parting shot? This event was just observed peaking at 16:06 UTC around region 2673, now located off the west limb. A Strong (G3) level radiation storm is now in progress as particles ejected outwards following the blast stream past Earth. Another massive coronal mass ejection (CME) is visible in STEREO imagery, but will be mostly directed towards the west. More updates once Earth facing LASCO coronagraph imagery becomes available.

<p>￼</p>

<p><strong>ALERT:</strong> <strong>Proton Event 10MeV Integral Flux exceeded 1000pfu</strong>
Begin Time: 2017 Sep 10 1840 UTC
NOAA Scale: S3 - Strong</p>

<p><strong>Potential Impacts:</strong> Radiation - Passengers and crew in high latitude, high altitude flights may experience increasing radiation exposures. Astronauts on EVA (extra-vehicular activity) are exposed to elevated radiation levels.</p>

<p>Spacecraft - Single-event upsets to satellite operations, noise in imaging systems, and slight reduction of efficiency in solar panels are likely.</p>

<p>Radio - Degraded or episodically blacked-out polar HF (high frequency) radio propagation.</p>

<p><strong>SUMMARY</strong>: <em>10cm Radio Burst</em>
Begin Time: 2017 Sep 10 1550 UTC
Maximum Time: 2017 Sep 10 1554 UTC
End Time: 2017 Sep 10 1706 UTC
Duration: 76 minutes
Peak Flux: 1900 sfu</p>

<p><strong>ALERT: Type II Radio Emission
Begin Time: 2017 Sep 10 1608 UTC
Estimated Velocity: 928 km/s</strong>
Description: Type II emissions occur in association with eruptions on the sun and typically indicate a coronal mass ejection is associated with a flare event.</p>

<p><strong>General forecast:</strong>
Another X Class Solar flare W CME &#39;Today&#39; to cause likely <strong>6.8 - 7.8 Earthquake: 7 day watch-</strong></p>

<p><em>(glancing blow off the east limb).</em> </p>

<p><em>Would rate higher magnitude if more earth directed. Its nearly a miss with a likely smaller incident per an earth directed hit.</em></p>

<p><em>September 11, 2017 @ 01:05 UTC</em></p>

<p><a href="http://www.solarham.net"><strong>Large Coronal Mass Ejection Update / Proton Storm</strong></a></p>

<p>Coronagraph imagery is now complete following the X8.2 solar flare on Sunday. The full halo coronal mass ejection (CME) was so powerful and widespread, there actually appears to be an Earth directed component, most evident when viewing the LASCO C3 (blue color) video. If so, an impact to our geomagnetic field may be possible by September 12th. More updates once an updated CME tracking model becomes available. </p>

<p><strong>MAJOR SOLAR FLARE AND RADIATION STORM:</strong></p>

<p>Departing sunspot AR2673 erupted again on Sept.10th (1606 UT), producing a major X8-class solar flare.  Protons accelerated toward Earth by the explosion are swarming around our planet now, causing a moderately strong solar radiation storm. (continued below)</p>

<p>￼
NASA Solar Dynamics Observatory recorded the flare&#39;s extreme UV flash</p>

<p>A pulse of ultraviolet and X-radiation from the flare ionized the top of Earth&#39;s atmosphere, triggering a shortwave radio blackout over the Americas (blackout map #1). That blackout is now subsiding. However, an even stronger blackout of shortwave radio communications around the poles is still underway (blackout map #2). Stay tuned for updates about this significant event.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There can be a high correlation but still no guarantee. </p>

<p>Earthquakes are caused by ruptures along faultlines where pressue has built to a certain tipping point. Solar activity appears to influence the final push for some faults to rupture. Other forces can also cause the rupture so earthquakes can occur independent of the sun and, there&#39;s no guarantee a solar event will be enough to cause a rupture if faultlines in the affected area are not ready to go.</p>

<p>The biggest issue with this theory is that it is <em>impossible</em> to predict the location that will be affected by any solar events due to all the bodies being in motion, the rotation of the earth and the fluid nature of solar ejecta.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a lot more of a relationship between the sun&#39;s solar geomagnetic activity and your cup of tea but I do agree that there is little usefulness to this relationship if it can&#39;t be used to identify a specific event.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The &quot;where&quot; is pretty much impossible to predict from solar data.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.swpc.noaa.gov/products/wsa-enlil-solar-wind-prediction">If you look at the solar wind data from NOAA</a> for example, you can gauge an approximate timeframe for an event to occur (in this case he says 7 days) based on the ruptions arrival at Earth but choosing which area will be affected is impossible as the Earth is turning whilst moving through space and the solar ejecta is also moving. There&#39;s then also latitude of impact to consider. </p>

<p>That doesn&#39;t rule anything invalid though. The fact remains that flares do infact appear to influence seismic events through the triggering of already stressed regions</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Without a location, this isn&#39;t a particularly bold prediction. 6.8+ earthquakes happen somewhere in the world <a href="https://m.emsc.eu/earthquake/latest.php?min_mag=6.8&amp;amp;max_mag=n/a&amp;amp;date=n/a&amp;amp;euromed=World">around once a month</a>, so you&#39;ve got a pretty good chance of predicting one happening with a week&#39;s range just by guessing.</p>

<p>If he&#39;s serious about this, he should probably hold off on predictions for anything except the much rarer big ones like Mexico last week. Predicting common events, and still often getting them wrong, makes it really easy to dismiss.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely. The biggest issue with this theory is that it is impossible to predict the location that will be affected by any solar events due to all the bodies being in motion, the rotation of the earth and the fluid nature of solar ejecta.</p>

<p>Basically all we can deduce from the solar geomagnetic relationship is that when conditions are right, a major magnitude quake is highly likely but his isn&#39;t particularly useful information. It&#39;s interesting, but not useful.</p>

<p>I am consistent in my belief that scientific related things be done in a scientific fashion as my posting history on multiple topics shows.

<p>There is overwhelming proof of conspiracy and incompetence in science, but anyone who points it out can be labeled an &quot;antiscience quack.&quot; If parsingsol is right, then the incompetence and collusion within the scientific arena will prevent him from being recognized until his methods are overwhelmingly proven beyond all doubt. </p>

<p>Then there is the problem of all of these scientists who have spent decades working on similar quake detection methods having their work eclipsed by parsingsol&#39;s, so I wholeheartedly agree that if he&#39;s right, it will be a long and uphill battle. </p>

Not that one cause the other, but that the processes that cause them might be similar. The other articles&#39; abstract was said that not all earthquakes were preceeded by solar flares and there was no clear correlation between large earthquakes and large solar flares.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah they&#39;re always talking about the big one coming to LA sometime &quot;soon&quot;. There&#39;s several fault lines in the US that are overdue for a rumble really. Check out the New Madrid Fault Line (Missouri/Tennessee border). It&#39;s gone off before in the early 1800s and was felt over most of the Eastern half of the US. If it goes off again, the shear amount of area it could cover to damage buildings would be huge.</p>

<p><strong>FAST CORONAL MASS EJECTION:</strong></p>

<p><em>A coronal mass ejection (CME) exploded from the vicinity of sunspot 1164 during the late hours of March 7th. It lept away from the sun traveling some 2200 km/s, making it the fastest CME since Sept. 2005. A movie of the cloud prepared by Karl Battams of the Naval Research Lab seems to show a small but non-negligible Earth-directed component. This CME and at least one other could brush against Earth&#39;s magnetic field on March 9th or 10th.</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is kind of interesting. I was actually going to comment on the last parsingsol thread about Idaho having a quake soon. I was looking at the USGS earthquake map then and saw plenty of activity in Soda Springs, Idaho. The Mexican quake had a swarm a week before, to the SE, before their big one, and then tons of aftershocks. Since this new prediction was posted I went to look if the USGS showed any swarm areas. SE Idaho is still getting hit.</p>

<p>It says their 7.0+ chance is low, but that&#39;s pretty crazy to see that much activity. I know fracking causes tremors you can feel in TX/OK. I don&#39;t think Idaho has fracking though. </p>

<p>X8.2 Solar Flare / Radiation Storm</p>

<p>September 10, 2017 @ 18:50 UTC</p>

<p>Okay... how about a major X8.2 solar flare for a parting shot? This event was just observed peaking at 16:06 UTC around region 2673, now located off the west limb. A Strong (G3) level radiation storm is now in progress as particles ejected outwards following the blast stream past Earth. Another massive coronal mass ejection (CME) is visible in STEREO imagery, but will be mostly directed towards the west. More updates once Earth facing LASCO coronagraph imagery becomes available. Click HERE for video of the solar flare.</p>

<p>￼</p>

<p>ALERT: Proton Event 10MeV Integral Flux exceeded 1000pfu Begin Time: 2017 Sep 10 1840 UTC NOAA Scale: S3 - Strong</p>

<p>Potential Impacts: Radiation - Passengers and crew in high latitude, high altitude flights may experience increasing radiation exposures. Astronauts on EVA (extra-vehicular activity) are exposed to elevated radiation levels.</p>

<p>Spacecraft - Single-event upsets to satellite operations, noise in imaging systems, and slight reduction of efficiency in solar panels are likely.</p>

<p>Radio - Degraded or episodically blacked-out polar HF (high frequency) radio propagation.</p>

<p>SUMMARY: 10cm Radio Burst Begin Time: 2017 Sep 10 1550 UTC Maximum Time: 2017 Sep 10 1554 UTC End Time: 2017 Sep 10 1706 UTC Duration: 76 minutes Peak Flux: 1900 sfu</p>

<p>ALERT: Type II Radio Emission Begin Time: 2017 Sep 10 1608 UTC Estimated Velocity: 928 km/s Description: Type II emissions occur in association with eruptions on the sun and typically indicate a coronal mass ejection is associated with a flare event.</p>

<p>Flare here 1 min data</p>

<p>General forecast: Another X Class Solar flare W CME &#39;Today&#39; to cause likely 6.8 - 7.8 Earthquake: 7 day watch-</p>

<p>(glancing blow off the east limb).</p>

<p>Would rate higher magnitude if more earth directed. Its nearly a miss with a likely smaller incident per an earth directed hit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maestro is correct.  The problem OP faces is that he is not the first or only one trying to find a correlation between solar flares and earthquakes.  His hurdle is that statistically speaking when we see patterns of solar flares, for instance when sun spots show up they increase the number of flares, we don&#39;t see any change in the numbers of earthquakes when flares show up or when they go away.  We&#39;ve been tracking flares and earthquakes for decades now, probably longer.</p>

<p>Point being if I make up some math and we see 5 earthquakes each day and 2 flares each day we should see 10 earthquakes each day when there are 4 flares in a day.  We don&#39;t see that though. 
 When we see 0 flares or 20 flares we still see 5 earthquakes each day.  Please remember those are just made up numbers to show what I mean.  The majority of people who study earthquakes and their causes don&#39;t agree with solar flares being related to them.  So he wouldn&#39;t be able to put this on <a href="/r/science">/r/science</a> or some sub like that and not get laughed at.  This would be one of the few subs that would be into this stuff.  </p>

<p>With what I said above I don&#39;t see any reason for OP to stop doing what he is doing.  We learn more and more about this stuff everyday and breakthroughs can come from very random things.  So even if he does or doesn&#39;t end up being correct, he might open up other possibilities.  Plus if he ends up being correct it would be the first time in history we could predict earthquakes successfully.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Rather than making predictions after future big solar flares, can you simple correlate flare activity with earthquake activity using data in some database somewhere? I understand it would be tricky because where do you draw the line - does the earthquake need to have happened within 7 days of the flare, or 10 days, or 1? Maybe you should ask for advice on how to set up the statistical test/collect the data instead of trying to predict one earthquake at a time? Then, if you see a relationship, do you expect that the area on earth affected corresponds to the area on the sun, assuming something deep in space is causing both? And do we miss half of solar flares that are on the side of the sun not facing us? That would make the statistics a lot more tricky. In any event, maybe people could brainstorm.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wish it did. </p>

<p>My initial idea was to plot the earthquakes in parsingsol (data by year) to the wind charts. You could easily do that with paint. Just copy the data images. Then find the earthquake lists in<a href="/r/parsingsol">/r/parsingsol</a> by year. 
Find the date. Plot. </p>

<p><em>the reason I recommend the data sets are that they are already set in order from big to small.</em></p>

<p>Seeing a trend that matched the highest bz activity to the largest quakes would be awesome. :) </p>

<p><a href="https://www.rt.com/news/402946-iss-shelter-solar-flare/">n terms of the weak shock front</a>.
The cme was intense enough to engage in safety protocol as it struck the iss. Just noting this isnt a force breach / &#39;mass&#39; based influencing. Its based on induction via charged particle and their intensity / effect on inner earth dynamo systems. (in terms of flux absorbtion). 
So just noting while it seems to show a weak &#39;shock&#39;. We are basing this on the intensity of the event via electronic charging ability. </p>

<p>Why?  You know you can look at past data and view the correlations and see that they are statistically insignificant right?  You know that <a href="/u/parsingsol">/u/parsingsol</a> has been presented with this data and then selectively ignored sections of it in order to suit their biases right?

    <div class="md"><p>In terms of location of earthquakes, how are you trying to predict it? I am wondering if you picture the sun and earth represented by balls , would the location on earth be analogous to the location where the flare was on the sun at the point in time of the flare? meaning, are you assuming something deep in space is causing solar flares and affecting a spot on earth pointing in the same direction as the flare (toward something further out in space)? how would you even look something like that up to find out where the analogous spot on earth was for a specific time point? and do we miss half of the solar flares, since we can&#39;t see the ones on the other side of the sun?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Final thoughts. I got this data really early. &quot;Did the post live&quot; did my best to project it. I do feel this is within what I expected. I did assess a 7.3 in 7 days. Im maybe upto 4-14hrs late. I dont want credit. But it did happen. So there is that. Its not in fiji either. (nor was the last in japan). We need a better location algorithm which is likely producable. Based on simple data extraction and an analytics algorithm which will detect probability. </p>

<p><strong>The incident today:</strong></p>

<p>38 minutes ago 7.1 magnitude, 51 km depth 
Raboso, Puebla, Mexico</p>

<p>I dont care if this wasn&#39;t what I posted. My only argument is that I expected that magnitude an event after that magnitude of an incoming solar event. Which happened again. So theres that...</p>

<p>Its two days late, not the magnitude predicted or anywhere near your locstions. How is this somehow within what you expected?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>But it falls outside your window. you dont just get to claim it.</p>

<p>There were 34 7-8 mag quakes in 2015-2016.</p>

<p>Assuming they were evenly distributed, you had a 1/3 of it happening in your 7 day, or 43% in the extended window youre now claiming. You had nearly a 50/50 shot at a lucky guess but someone this is all down to your model.</p>
