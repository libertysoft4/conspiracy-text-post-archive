    <div class="md"><p>While there certainly may be a shadow banned user commenting, don&#39;t mistake Reddit&#39;s queue system for shadow banned users.</p>

<p>Comments are submitted to a queue. The comment count is updated immediately, but the comment isn&#39;t available until the queue processes it. Sometimes that can be several minutes, especially during busy times.</p>

<p>So you may see the comment count increment and no comments showing.</p>

<p>That might be shadow banned users, but it&#39;s probably just a lagging queue.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree- think that cars will be cloud based and leased for durations lasting from minutes to much longer. Using your personal chip, the car environment is customizable to your needs (data sources, seats, etc). You might be charged based on your CO2 emissions (if you need to use more electricity to go fast, have bigger ride you&#39;ll be charged more- an enclosed scooter type format might be the cheapest). Hopefully you can fly at some point. </p>

<p>Anyway, it will be controlled from the cloud. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I saw that article and it kinda made me mad. If you spend that much on a car and they market it as a 200mile range per charge (just an estimate) then a natural disaster strikes and boom you can go 300miles on a charge it make me very suspicious of that company and I&#39;d probably get rid of it because whose to say when a new model comes out they won&#39;t limit it to 150miles per charge?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Same reason Adobe sells two different versions of Photoshop. </p>

<p>Tesla wants to sell as many cars as possible. Selling a cheaper version lets them access customers they couldn&#39;t otherwise, but it has to be more limited than the full-price car or people would only buy the cheaper one. </p>

<p>Car makers have been doing this from the beginning. Only difference now is that the limitation is software, so people can pay to lift it at any time.</p>

<p>It does benefit the customer, ultimately, because we get a more affordable Tesla.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How is this scary?  Lithium ion batteries degrade significantly faster when you charge them to 100% capacity and discharge them to 0% - as a result Tesla caps the max and min charge of your car in order to increase the batteries longevity.  </p>

<p>I&#39;d also like to mention that Tesla do have access to a lot of information from your car - though they cannot drive it remotely (only have access to the brakes atm).</p>

<p>Privacy and security are very important especially as we get close to fully automated driving - but Tesla are the best out of all the car manufacturers by quite a wide margin.  This could certainly change, but let&#39;s not bash Tesla when they are clearly superior to Volkswagen, GM, Jeep, etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Only access to the brakes? Idk. Maybe its for the good. I do have a new vehicle with Onstar and i love it. So maybe it is good. It feels odd that they make you pay $4500-$9000 for more battery life they can add remotely. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The closer to 100% and 0% you allow the battery to get to - the more the capacity decreases each cycle.  Tesla offer an 8 year unlimited mile warranty on the battery - if the battery decayes too quickly it could cost them a lot of money to replace batteries - it&#39;s not as simple as a flick of a switch </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Everyone is freaking out about this. It would be retarded of Tesla to not streamline their production lines and produce fewer battery types where some are choked, but can be upgraded for a cost should the customer choose. It benefits everyone! Not everyone has money to buy a model X or whatever the fancy models are called, or a model with more battery capacity, so they get a choked version with possibility to upgrade.</p>

<p>This is standard business practice and everyone that has such an option to do so, will do so.</p>
