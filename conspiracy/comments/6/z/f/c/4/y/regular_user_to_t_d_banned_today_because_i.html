<p>To democracy, freedom, rights - just about everything that gives us power. Seeing as it&#39;s the anniversary of 9/11, look at their involvement in 9/11 and the repercussions that has had for the entire world. The world was never the same after that. It made it worse for the people and better for those who want power over the people.  </p>

<p>Okay then, Mr. Disingenuous. You&#39;ve yet to elucidate <em>any</em> motivation for this &quot;Zionist Cabal&quot;. More importantly, you&#39;ve yet to point out why anyone should <em>care</em> about Zionists. </p>

<p>Given the absolute lack of legitimate motivation; there can only be irrational and illegitimate motivations left: including bigotry. Since this is a tangentially jewish thing; the type of bigotry that applies is anti-semitism. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you are done being deliberately obtuse; Zionists of different factions (ie: Evangelical Christians, the Israelis blah blah) defend and push the Zionist agenda because they believe that the reestablishment of Israel in the Holy Land is necessary to bring about their shitty fan-fic book&#39;s version of the &quot;End Times&quot;.</p>

<p>The Jews believe they are God&#39;s chosen people. The Christians believe that when Revelation happens they will be taken in the rapture and put in the fast lane to heaven instead of having to be left behind to witness the devastation.</p>

<p>Speaking of deliberate obtuseness... </p>

<p>My question is <em>why should I care</em>. More than that, you&#39;ve illuminated a core problem with the &quot;Zionists are an evil cabal&quot; thing. Each Zionist element clearly has different motivations. In fact, many of them are patently at odds with each other. My point is  this: How can you ascribe malice and coordinated central intent to a group that is clearly at loggerheads with itself? </p>

<p>In other words: where is the conspiracy?</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>The Protocols of the Meetings of the Learned Elders of Zion is an antisemitic fabricated text purporting to describe a Jewish plan for global domination. The forgery was first published in Russia in 1903, translated into multiple languages, and disseminated internationally in the early part of the 20th century. According to the claims made by some of its publishers, the Protocols are the minutes of a late 19th-century meeting where Jewish leaders discussed their goal of global Jewish hegemony by subverting the morals of Gentiles, and by controlling the press and the world&#39;s economies.</p>

<p>Henry Ford funded printing of 500,000 copies that were distributed throughout the U.S. in the 1920s. The Nazis sometimes used the Protocols as propaganda against Jews; it was assigned by some German teachers, as if factual, to be read by German schoolchildren after the Nazis came to power in 1933, despite having been exposed as fraudulent by The Times of London in 1921. <strong>It is still widely available today in numerous languages, in print and on the Internet, and continues to be presented by some proponents as a genuine document.</strong></p>

<p>What kind of disingenuous shit is this, dude. You know damn well that asking people their religion and then changing your responses to them based on that comes really close to bigotry. Worse, if it&#39;s only related to Jews, then you are damn close to anti-semitism. Don&#39;t act like you don&#39;t know this, and don&#39;t act like you don&#39;t skirt the rules really closely on shit like this. </p>
