        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This isn&#39;t a new theory I&#39;m sure but I just wanted to post a few thoughts on the subject.</p>

<p>As most of us on this sub are aware, there is a huge amount of propaganda being pushed onto the web to influence public opinion on various subjects. YouTube, Google, Facebook and many other sites are now using advanced AI to alter what information any given user is subjected to. I believe Reddit too is using similar tactics.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/thenextweb.com/artificial-intelligence/2017/08/02/youtube-unleashes-google-ai-crack-extremist-content/%3famp=1">https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/thenextweb.com/artificial-intelligence/2017/08/02/youtube-unleashes-google-ai-crack-extremist-content/%3famp=1</a></p>

<p>I have noticed posts and comments I have made to distinguish patterns in votes and have found that karma changes up and down regardless of how many new views they have, which tells me that they are not necessarily correlated with one another. A post will be downvoted without actually receiving any new views so can only mean that either this is automated (AI interpreting whether the post fits an agenda then adjusting accordingly) or mods have the power to alter this manually. </p>

<p>The purpose of Reddit isn&#39;t to stifle information as much as it is to influence users into believing that certain mentalities (pro-war, nationalism, race inequality etc) are the norm and therefore what you should believe.</p>

<p>A take away to combat this is to think more critically about information and opinions presented and make up your own mind without taking heed too much of the apparent &quot;public&quot; opinion and use the power of democracy to combat the influence. I.e use the voting buttons much more frequently and comment regardless of how you expect your opinion to be received.</p>

<p>Edit: I have assumed it to be the CIA that is causing this social engineering phenomenon but it could just as easily be other intelligence agencies or a mix of many. The point is that content and commentary on here is being used as a means to manipulate it&#39;s population. </p>

<p>In other words, to make everyone think that everyone thinks this way.  Have you considered why would they feel the need to do this? Isn&#39;t it a rather desperate attempt? Have you considered how majority of people <em>really</em> think and feel in private?  The feeling that you have of being isolated or alone is really just a carefully cultivated illusion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Stay positive and hopeful that the truth eventually wins. A single, well-sourced lucky comment can negate all of the propaganda that was fed to thousands of people on a topic. </p>

<p>Here is a list of news articles and other information about shilling: <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/shills/comments/4kdq7n/astroturfing_information_megathread_revision_8/">https://np.reddit.com/r/shills/comments/4kdq7n/astroturfing_information_megathread_revision_8/</a></p>

<p>The best thing we could do to mitigate some of the effects of this social media control is to spread information about it. The more people who know about it, the more people will be skeptical of vote tallies and what they see at the top of comments sections and their front page. The only reason the propaganda is so effective is because people aren&#39;t aware of it. A person is much more likely to engage with and be convinced by an ad if they don&#39;t even know it&#39;s an ad. It&#39;s basically just a giant peer pressure machine. They pretend to be your peers (fellow redditors), and manipulate the votes in such a way as to make you think the general consensus is this or that. </p>

<p>They can hide links from most of the public by simply using a bunch of accounts to downvote posts early on so they don&#39;t gain traction. They of course cannot hide everything, so the other tactic is to just keep participating instead of giving up just because your content was buried a few times. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wish I had your confidence.  As George Orwell demonstrated and warned about, deception might not last forever under normal conditions, but combined with the usage of social engineering/social revision it can certainly last indefinitely.  </p>

<p>So much money has been poured into mapping out human psychology and devoloping propoganda/methodologies to influence the human brain and manipulate the public in addition to all of the monitoring that I think there&#39;s a real risk of a 1984 situation if the wrong person ever holds the key (Snowden&#39;s idea of a latchkey government supports this nicely). </p>

<p>That&#39;s not to say that the people who run the show right now aren&#39;t awful.  However, lets say somebody like Hitler, Napoleon, or Stalin (Trump doesn&#39;t really compare imo though people do equate him with such figures) takes control of the government.  Somebody with the drive and intelligence to really seize control of the reigns.</p>

<p>America has become so consumed with war that as a society we&#39;ve sort of rationalized/normalized what our government gets away with.  Personally, while World War 3 is a terrifying prospect, that&#39;s really only the tip of the possible outcomes that worry me.  </p>

<p>I would agree with you that such an act is ideal if it could be carried out successfully.  So far however, this metholdogy has proved very ineffective.  Pretty much <em>all</em> of the people who have acted in this way have been disposed of.  Modern society is essentially designed to stack the cards against such individuals not only through setting up mechanisms to be used against them, but by engineering the public&#39;s thought patterns in such a way that they become resistant to such revelations.</p>

<p>New methodologies have to be created if one is to fight the beast.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>True.  It&#39;s a complicated situation.  Both anonymity and publicity carry certain pros and cons.  The importance to me though isn&#39;t whether you&#39;re anonymous or public.  It&#39;s how you play the game.</p>

<p>The old school way of trying to bring things to the public eye and that they&#39;ll somehow sort themselves out doesn&#39;t work anymore, if it ever did in the first place.  But you are right that sitting on information/working behind the scenes runs the risk of having even less of an effect if you do get targeted.</p>

<p>Here a <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/samharris/comments/5uppqp/the_irredeemable_left_how_wide_of_net_is/ddw8xen/">quote </a> from u/ClosedSociety404</p>

<p>&quot;I&#39;m overwhelmed with fear for the future but convinced that a putsch against the regime is the obligation of all moral beings. I hope and pray that the process is mostly just a reemergence of free speech, that the violence entailed is not much more than the smashing of the Berlin wall. But whatever the consequences, we must march forward because a genocidal totalitarian closed society cannot go on.</p>

<p>It worked to an extent.  Though the circles that made up the East German government were never fully dealt with and likely continue to affect the nation to this day.  Not to mention that most Soviet officials have maintained their allegiance to Russia/the SU even after its collapse.</p>

<p>I would also argue that it was more than just the protests that did it though that certainly played a part.</p>

<p>Yet your assertion was that it was the protests themselves that led to the deconstruction of the wall.  Not any of the other numerous factors that put pressure on the Soviets to destroy it.  I think the protests were more the straw that broke the camels back than the actual defining reason for the collapse of the wall.  Protests had been occurring for some time before its fall without the wall collapsing.</p>

<p>Stop twisting my words to make them fit your own perception of reality.</p>

<p>I offered an example of Berlin Wall falling to show that your &quot;That has never at any point in history worked out though&quot; posted in reaction to me quoting another user who highlighted the significance of &quot;a reemergence of free speech&quot; for a - hopefully peaceful - revolution to happen.

<p>Go read some history books if you are not aware that a critical mass was reached and the majority of  people were <em>suddenly</em> not afraid to start loudly telling the truth after decades of oppression and fear of the regime. Their inner wall of fear symbolically collapsed, and the big, concrete one soon therafter.</p>

<p>It&#39;s less that I&#39;m twisting your words and more that you had very few words to begin with. With no context on your part I <em>had</em> to make some assumptions in order to figure out wha how to you were talking about.</p>

<p>You should have probably explained this at the start in order to prevent individuals misconstruing your meaning like I did.</p>

<p>Anyways the discussion between me and him had very little to do with freedom of speech so I don&#39;t know where you&#39;re pulling that from.  I mean, I guess it could be seen that way in a roundabout fashion, but it had less to do with freedom of speech itself and more about how to disclose certain uncomfortable truths to the public in a way that they would believe and act upon.  But I think you&#39;re sort of missing the point of what we were talking about.  Which is probably <em>why</em> I misconstrued what you were saying since it&#39;s built around a slightly different discussion/point.</p>

<p>Free speech already exists in America.  It might have started to become slightly restricted in recent years, but it&#39;s never been the main issue of this nation until very recently and during the McCarthy era.  But that was more of the exception than the rule.</p>

<p>My argument that &quot;that has never at any point in history worked out though&quot; was more in regards to discrete information being disclosed to the public in a way that leads to revolution/realization vs.  Revolution being the means of recreating freedom of speech which seems to be what you&#39;re arguing for.  The fall of the Berlin Wall had absolutely nothing to do with intelligence information getting leaked to the general public, and like I demonstrated in the articles I provided, that information was largely buried and obfuscated by the fall.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I mean I get where you&#39;re coming from but the &quot;truth&quot; you&#39;re talking about doesn&#39;t seem to be the same &quot;truth&quot; I&#39;m talking about.  Not to mention the Fall of the Berlin Wall is a <em>very</em> different situation than, say, Edward Snowden&#39;s leaks.  So I think it&#39;s hard to compare the two since one is more about disclosure of deep state secrets and the other is about a social movement built on oppression.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Not physically no, but they let it happen.  It takes two to tango. They could have just as easily said &quot;fuck off&quot; and shot everybody.  That seems to be a much more common approach these days. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The only way we&#39;ll truly put change into effect, I believe, is through a literal consciousness awakening for humanity. Our reality has been inverted long before you or I were alive. What I mean is, there has been a focus on self-service for thousands and thousands of years, as Satan or Lucifer or whomever would want. In order for such a reality to be maintained for so long, the people who make up the society that lives this reality have to believe themselves to be something they are not. Today, the majority of humanity literally believes they are their self-image. A very small percentage of humanity fundamentally understands that what each of us truly is is consciousness, or awareness. This small percentage understands that one&#39;s entire understanding of one&#39;s self is just a thought, and all thoughts happen <em>within</em> the totality of what we actually are. Meditation opens a space within the meditator to be able to see this fact experientially, which is life changing. To see this truth is to awaken. Once one awakens, one&#39;s attachment to the world and to one&#39;s self dissipates. And such a person is most inclined to speak fundamental truth, and only truth, because no longer is there some self-image within the person for whom the person lies to get what the identity would want. I hope this makes sense. Long story short, once humanity takes a break from following the narrative that society puts in front of us on TV and radio, and once humanity looks <em>within</em> and realizes that we are all literally the same no-thing&#39;ness, we will finally let go of this mind virus (ego, or allowing one&#39;s self-image to control one&#39;s life) and truth will reign free.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You also have to realize most of reddit didn&#39;t have any mods and wasn&#39;t controlled by mods.  Then <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/ibr9r/new_subreddit_moderation/">6 years ago they took over</a> and now act like gatekeepers on stories they don&#39;t like.  For instance, go search &quot;Awan&quot; in r/news, 20 house democrates had they electronics and data stolen and accuse IT staff of it and asked for an investigation, which would seem like huge news.  Although r/news won&#39;t allow any posts related to it because they claim it breaks the politics rule, but most days there are blatently political posts all over their front page.  Even right now  [r/politics is removing any post about Hillary criticizing Bernie as being off topic](corrupt_ctr_mod_utherealdanhill_is_still_deleting).  This kind of thing happens on the regular as you probably know.  To think that the 5th largest website in the US isn&#39;t controlled seems naive to me.</p>

That shit is legitimately happening but most of you fucking ignore it. Does anyone have proof shareblue or CTR exists in the way you claim, like having 1000s of commenters on reddit? I&#39;ve never seen any proof they operate that way but a section of users always state it as if its a fact. Meanwhile, there is actual proof they&#39;re overflowing with russian trolls subverting their groups and none of them/you seem to care. Some of you need to stop chasing boogeymen and wake the fuck up to the real threats.

<p>Then a DARPA Contractor, Rand Waltzman, tries to <a href="https://admin.govexec.com/media/defense_technology_briefing_-_issue_12_(6%29.pdf">spew the campaign</a> to social media under the guise of fighting radicals and ISIS extremists.

<p>very few people can thrive in the realm of truth. It&#39;s a lonely path. This sub is full of cointelpro and bots. There are few real users here, but it doesn&#39;t matter, it mimicks the real world. I like to come here and shout some words down on this sub. The truth has its own intrinsic value even if no one believes it. Everyone is dead asleep here and everywhere. Awakening is a spiritual thing. The Truth is inconvenient to material beings cause they don&#39;t know the truth about themselves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This has been evident and talked about for awhile.</p>

<p>Instead of out and out deleting content bots are used to quickly UPVOTE or DOWNVOTE content. </p>

<p>Is a thread something that doesn&#39;t align with the entity&#39;s viewpoint? Set the bots to work and downvote into oblivion.</p>

<p>Is a thread something that fits the entity&#39;s narrative? Set the bots to upvote and any comments within the thread that dissent are downvoted.</p>

<p>That&#39;s how any entity—the US government, foreign governments, private corporations, etc—can easily manipulate Reddit. </p>

<p>Bots are a real thing and can be bought. We know this.</p>

<p>You can go a step further. Have the bots create content that fits your narrative. Or hire actual people to blanket Reddit with posts that you want in the public realm.</p>

<p>Race inequality is the natural state of mankind because the races are different and can never be equal for as long as those differences exist. This also dovetails into the reason why we need ethno-nationalism, as it seperates the races and ensures that people cannot be treated unfairly, because humans prefer to be with their own. Race relations continue to get worse because borders existed between different peoples for a good reason, we&#39;re slowly rediscovering this fact and it will sadly end in blood. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wars are necessary because evil exists, you need war to confront evil. Evil wants to destroy, it doesn&#39;t want to reason. Think of evil as a cancerous cyst, and war as the knife that can cut it off.   </p>

<p>We&#39;re not one people, we are many people, with different customs, languages, ideas and so forth. What one people prefer will differ from nation to nation, from race to race. Some groups enjoy collectivism, other groups are more individualistic and so forth. </p>

<p>When you force people to come together, they tend to bunker down and isolate themselves to their own communities, creating micro-countries within countries, this is the natural state of man. We enjoy being around others that look like us because we ultimately prefer our children to the children of the foreigner. The family is a microcosm of the nation, and for as long as you prefer your own family over the family of the foreigner, racism and racial inequalities will always exist. To destroy it is to destroy your preference for your own child, which is a terrible thing. </p>

<p>When borders fail, wars will begin and humanity will rediscover why borders existed in the first place. We&#39;re not going to realize this until it&#39;s too late and a lot of people will die. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>well said</p>

<p>it is worse than this though</p>

<p>i can testify that this summer reddit posts i have made, and basically my entire online history, has been used for various undercovers to harass me with various scenarios to entrap me into crimes.  </p>

<p>i believe but cannot prove that only a small portion of these numerous incidents are actual law enforcement.  NoDapl reports similar types of encounters with the specific private &#39;security&#39; firms that have been paid to attack them.  </p>

<p>there is a definite change here, where &#39;precrime&#39; is a thing.  they decide who they would like to see in jail based upon how much your online life goes against certain narratives (in my case,  i can&#39;t stand israel, have posted a lot on r/psychonaut and am actively investigating #pizzagate/Arizona&#39;s apparent child abuse ring inside of their cps) </p>

<p>plus my graphic about the pyramid where I list a ton of actual entitities that are bound to be also already surveilled...but the game has changed, they aren&#39;t just gathering anymore.  the little gambits they run are things like dressing up like my ex girlfriend and her current husband, or like a woman who i had a problem with at a job.  </p>

<p>my family doesn&#39;t believe me, they can&#39;t imagine cops would go to these lengths, but they don&#39;t understand it&#39;s private now.  stratfor etc has all the same information the fbi does because it&#39;s all either been leaked or they get it from fake facebork friends i have.  </p>

<p>im a comedian and writer, i can&#39;t live my life without being a public person and speaking my mind freely. </p>

<p>it does appear that the united states may no longer be the place for me.  baiting someone, even if with shallow psych 101 crap, is a form of intimidation where you are saying &#39;we want you in jail, we are following you, we think you are one of the bad guys, maybe we will just frame you, or who knows what, but we are just always here expecting the worst of you, gathering more information&#39; </p>

<p>friends and even a girf i was with i believe turned out to be long term operatives.  it&#39;s been very tricky to determine who is real in the last few years of my life. </p>

<p>be VERY WARY at any festivals or public events, they are out there, spying, instigating, obstructing.  it&#39;s a very scary time to be alive.  it&#39;s exactly like the matrix, all of the agents are actually the same person, and nearly anyone could turn into an agent at any moment.  </p>

<p>and the people in your life who are like &#39;aw gosh golly, the police dont have time to get into all that&#39; dont have a leg to stand on, the stratfor docs point it out clearly</p>

<p>im also afraid they are siloing us, where even if we message or email or tweet to some people, they just say, no.  or if they dont like you, then they fuck up your matches on okcupid or tinder.  or your resumes dont get to where you send them. </p>

<p>they could totally decide who is allowed to even exist economically without you even knowing your life is being quietly ruined.  </p>

<p>again, scary times.  hiding under a rock isn&#39;t going to make it go away either.  </p>

<p>i am looking for other sites where i might be able to contribute and actually be seen and get credit for content based on the quality thereof, rather than whether or not i kiss israeli ass.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>wow, this post where i totally go out on a limb at risk to myself only has 2 votes.  </p>

<p>and then what are votes here anyway but puffs of wind?  </p>

<p>so for the sake of maybe someone seeing something i write i post here, but at this point it&#39;s become clear how really risky that is, and that in the united states there is no real freedom.  only if you are a willing to be delusional enough to believe the official narrative.  </p>

<p>see, you respond but you don&#39;t address any real issues, and that is the exact pattern of the fake law enforcement types i encounter.  </p>

<p>never any depth, always surface level, oh it&#39;ll be alright, dont be too upset about how im shoving this up your ass etc etc</p>

<p>This is the biggest give-away for me.<br/>
Virtually every popular sub on reddit -- subs that are supposedly progressive leaning -- supports the U.S. military and its invasions.<br/>
IMO, that&#39;s not even close to possible and shows that CIA/<a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2014/07/eglin-air-force-base-busted-gaming-reddit.html">Eglin   </a> has extremely strong ability to manipulate votes and comment visibility.</p>

<p>A post will be downvoted without actually receiving any new views so can only mean that either this is automated (AI interpreting whether the post fits an agenda then adjusting accordingly) or mods have the power to alter this manually.</p>

<p>Votes are actually fuzzed a bit for whatever reason. Aside from that, mods do not actually have the ability to alter the karma of any post (source: I&#39;m a mod).</p>

<p>These and other aspects are surely part of it and we could debate it for hours, but the fact is that Berlin Wall is gone. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yet your assertion was that it was the protests themselves that led to the deconstruction of the wall.  Not any of the other numerous factors that put pressure on the Soviets to destroy it.  I think the protests were more the straw that broke the camels back than the actual defining reason for the collapse of the wall.  Protests had been occurring for some time before its fall without the wall collapsing.</p>
