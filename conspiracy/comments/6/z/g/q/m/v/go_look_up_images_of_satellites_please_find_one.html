        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>seriously I just spend and hour on military websites and multiple search engines looking for an actual photo a satellite. NOT A SINGLE ONE WAS FOUND. I don&#39;t buy the idea that they can&#39;t show us a real image for security reasons. If that were true,  showing a cartoon would be no different. If there were security reasons for not showing what an actual satellite looks like I don&#39;t understand how showing a cartoon would be ok. 
The only conclusion I can make from this is the satellites are not what they tell us. The cartoons are not real representations of what actual satellites look like. </p>

<p>Now, I know this is a big idea for some to wrap their head around. So I&#39;m not going to jump ahead to the next logical conclusion which I have drawn, but I&#39;m sure some of you already know and agree with me. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Our continents are pretty well defined though. Shouldn&#39;t it be extremely obvious what huge chunk of land this is? It kind of looks like South America I guess but it definitely looks different enough from what I&#39;m used to seeing on a map that it makes me confused. Is the fish eye lense causing this?

    <div class="md"><p>No, and there are logical reasons you can&#39;t figure out what land mass this is.</p>

<p>Firstly, you don&#39;t know how high this satellite is. If it were only 70km from the surface, you wouldn&#39;t really be able to make out large land masses. Without a frame of reference such as altititude, you can&#39;t easily determine how much land you should  theoretically be able to see.</p>

<p>Secondly, the earth does not look like a globe. If you&#39;re trying to figure out what is what by comparing it to a map, you&#39;re gonna have a bad time. </p>

<p>Thirdly, because of the camera lens, depth is skewed as well as distance. The lens itself will warp the view of the land mass. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t necessarily believe the earth is flat, I no longer believe the globe model. </p>

<p>Believing spaceflights and satellites not being real is really only an extension of the more <em>mainstream</em> Moonlanding hoaxers/NASAfakesstuff/Marsmoonrockscrowd/... conspiracies.</p>

<p>It&#39;s an anwser to the &quot;Why?&quot; would they fake all this stuff? Cuz they have to...</p>

<p>Logic only goes so far when talking about perspective, what we <em>should</em> be able to observe, what we <em>are</em> observing and what <em>shouldn&#39;t</em> be observable.</p>

<p>Flat Earthers (or people grouped up with them, like myself) aren&#39;t retarded. We didn&#39;t suddenly drop the ball somewhere. Enough of us struggled through and realize that at the end, there&#39;s a serious issue for the globe model. The theory of evolution is already dead in my book (I would take this to court, given a laptop and the internet to source my defence) and the Big Bang is nothing but Big Balony.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a crazy world out there, I&#39;ve come to realize. Flat Earthers don&#39;t have (all) the anwsers, but it&#39;s a start. The only way I see to ever get this conspiracy shit off the ground. (I&#39;m talking all conspiracies, most if not all tying back to the secret societies, starting with those)</p>
