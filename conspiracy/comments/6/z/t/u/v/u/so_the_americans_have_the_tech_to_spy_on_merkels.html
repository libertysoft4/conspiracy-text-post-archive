    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Where is the SMOKING GUN that will get Trump out of office? There must be ONE only. And I want it in your words, not what he said she said.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are several very realistic options to charge/impeach Trump with a crime:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Obstruction of justice</strong>. Comey firing, and very possible that there was criminal intentions behind the firing of Sally Yates and Preet Bharara. As well as pressuring James Comey to drop the investigation of Mike Flynn.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Financial crimes involving the Trump Org</strong>. The Trump Org has been laundering hundreds of millions for Kazak and Russian mafia organisations since 2005. Trump himself has been paid millions from these deals as well as retained ownership in the projects involved in the laundering operations. During these deals, Trump and the Russian and Kazak mafia associates committed large scale tax fraud, embezzlement, money laundering, and investment fraud. The largest operation was done in NY state, making it impossible for Trump to pardon state crimes involving tax fraud and money laundering. Even aside from the Kazak and Russian mafia operations, Donald Sr and Ivanka were heavily involved in a laundering operations ran by the Transportation Minister of Azerbaijan, who has used construction projects around the same time period to launder money for the Iranian Revolutionary Guard.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Changing campaign and party positions under direction of Russian intelligence</strong>. This was done primarily through Paul Manafort. During the campaign, Paul Manafort was not paid a cent from campaign finances. I don&#39;t understand how this is not bigger, but Paul Manafort was in debt $35 million during the campaign to Oleg Deripaska and Dmytro Firtash, both figures which are heavily associated with Russian mafia organisations. Deripaska went on to essentially forgive Manafort&#39;s debt right before he became campaign manager, effectively paying him close to $10 million while he was paid nothing from the campaign. Manafort was also actively laundering millions during the campaign he previously received from work he did in Ukraine for Rinat Akhmetov Oleg Deripaska. While this was all happening, Manafort organised the efforts at the RNC to change the parties official stance on arming the Ukrainian army in their civil war. Several Manafort associates were engaged in these efforts and have went on the record acknowledging their involvement. Konstantin Kilimnik - a &#39;former&#39; GRU officer - has admitted his involvement in the policy changing process. Rick Gates would have likely been involved in the process considering how much he previously worked with Manafort and Kilimnik in Ukraine as well. Aside from the RNC platform change, the June meeting at Trump Tower regarding the Magnitsky act is also another instance related to illegal influence peddling and lobbying. There is also a larger instance that likely ties into the big picture with the active negotiations by Trump himself to sign onto a Trump Tower Moscow deals while he was actively in the campaign. These Trump Tower efforts involved someone who was also very well connected to the Russian mafia.</p></li>

<p>No you didn&#39;t. You asked specifically:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>DISCUSS: Where is the SMOKING GUN that will get Trump out of office? There must be ONE only. And I want it in your words, not what he said she said.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You are moving the goal posts. The reasons I specified contained publicly available information regarding high crimes committed during the campaign, after the campaign, and crimes that Russian intelligence would have used for blackmail. These crimes would be, as you put it, &#39;<em>will get Trump out of office</em>&#39;.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Nixon was brought up on 3 articles of impeachment. So by precedent, you are able to impeach a president on multiple crimes, as well as crimes that were committed before coming to power.</p>

Tillerson has a lot of incentive to start removing names from the list and dismantling the sanctions in any way he can.

    <div class="md"><p>So why would Trump delegate the authority to these two people then? If they weren&#39;t going to do <em>something</em> there would be no need to give them the power at all. Unless they aren&#39;t planning on removing any names at all from the list, but adding more names to it. Certainly there are a few business rivals of Trump, Putin, or other associated billionaires that could really be hurt by adding their names to the sanctions. </p>

<p>Yes. Exactly. This never happened. The woman Don Jr met had absolutely NO RELATION to the Russian government and was previously paid by the DNC. Her FB page had pictures from Hillary fundraisers lol.</p>

<p>-You say no information was exchanged in the meeting but that is coming from the two people who repeatedly denied the meeting even took place.

<p>The obstruction of justice charges are directly tied to Trump. Those are easy to point out. Plus they have the most impeach precedent behind them.</p>

<p>The financial crimes are also very easy to point out too. Trump made millions from huge money laundering operations from 2005 to his presidency, when he dropped all of the remaining deals because of the &#39;conflicts of interest&#39;. Look at the Trump Soho development project. That entire corporate structure reeks of Kazak and Russian mafia involvement. That&#39;s not including Baku and Batumi deals. </p>

<p>Asking the head of the FBI to drop a criminal investigation into your National Security Adviser is obstruction of justice. There is no grey area there.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Any financial crimes (I&#39;m sure there are multiple) that were committed before inauguration will have to wait until his time after office. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Clinton V Jones already established that a sitting president is not immune from litigation stemming from before they were president. So Trump is absolutely vulnerable to litigation regarding financial crimes committed before he became president. His children were also involved in those crimes, which opens another area of possible obstruction if Trump intervened or intervenes in any state level crime investigations regarding those deals.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That is unless his enterprise does some stupid, like a big foreign deal, whilst he is in office. Which is quite possible.</p>

<p>Those actually would not be of any legal liability to him considering he is not operating the Trump Org while he is president.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure what it&#39;s like where you are, but in America they generally have to go through trials and investigations.  The more serious the crime and/or more connected the defendant, the longer it can take to gather more evidence.  Mueller is investigating, though it might take even longer before anything concrete is released to the public.  It&#39;s just media conjecture right now until a trial starts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right.  Until Mueller&#39;s team goes to trial the public basically only has limited information on exactly what is being done.  There&#39;s some educated guesses based on who he&#39;s hiring and who he&#39;s been questioning, so it seems like Manafort might be screwed, but as it&#39;s an ongoing investigation they&#39;re trying to be tight-lipped about it.  Not sure if your country&#39;s news will cover it, but I&#39;m sure if you keep up with various news outlets online you will likely see notice of the trial when it commences.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump himself said that he would lock hillary up when in office but still didn&#39;t because there is nothing to talk about that is even close to happened with him. Information can definitely be argued to be illegal and even if that is proven not to be, the cover up is definitely illegal. The dirt was promised, he accepts the meeting, the lawyer they met with lobbied to end the magnitsky act, later in the election dirt is released, just this week magnistky act actions are being made. It is a pretty clear line from just public articles and knowledge that it is extremely possible that information was traded for international laws being changed.</p>

After that the press lets them trickle truth for days before hitting them again and again with the actual events that they learned about.

<p>As a lawyer, WTF are you talking about? That is absolutely not true.

    <div class="md"><p>Nope. And no evidence that Trump colluded with Russia will ever come out. Mark my words. Otherwise, it would have already. There is no way that sort of info wouldn&#39;t get leaked. Don&#39;t be naive. </p>

<p>This investigation is just a fishing expedition, anyway. It makes no sense to investigate something to see if you can find evidence for it. I say we investigate John McCain for assassinating JFK. Just because we have no evidence that he did doesn&#39;t mean that it doesn&#39;t exist! These investigations take time, we will find out when John McCain is put on trial.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/09/08/presidential-memorandum-secretary-state-and-secretary-treasury">https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/09/08/presidential-memorandum-secretary-state-and-secretary-treasury</a> </p>

<p>Trump just gave the authority to remove names from the Magnitsky Act restrictions to his Secretary of Treasury and Secretary of State. This is what Russia has wanted all along since so many of Putin&#39;s very wealthy allies had their American financial investments frozen by the act. Congress had passed a bill that prevented Trump from personally lifting these and other sanctions so he thinks he has found a loophole by delegating the power to his subordinates. Even if congress determines this is in violation of their previous bill, it won&#39;t matter since it will likely be too late to stop the Russians from recovering all of their financial assets. Let&#39;s not forget that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson was also the head of ExxonMobil who had a very large oil investment in Russia blocked by these sanctions as well. He wouldn&#39;t have any motive to mess with these sanctions now would he? </p>

<p>The majority of &quot;leaks&quot; that have been coming from the investigation revolve around what people have said about it or what they think about it.  None of the actual evidence has leaked because:</p>

<p>1) it doesn&#39;t exist. This probably isn&#39;t the case, as the investigation has gone pretty far. Remember, systematically a lot of stuff from the Steele document has been proven correct.
2) the investigators don&#39;t leak evidence because this is what they do professionally. </p>

<p>Do investigations start before or after a crime has taken place? What crime did Trump commit to warrant an investigation? </p>

<p>See what the problem is here? CRIMES get investigated. There has been no crime so how can there be an investigation? This is called fishing.... </p>

<p>Is Trump installing the &quot;Russian System&quot; in America????? LOL. I don&#39;t want the Russian system. I want the classic American system. That&#39;s why I voted Trump, that&#39;s why I&#39;m 1000% behind him. There is not a single thing he&#39;s done that indicates to me he&#39;s Pro-Communist. </p>

<p>All he&#39;s done is help the working class of ALL RACES, GENDERS, AND ETHNICITIES. Ending the TPP saved the working class in this country. Securing the border again will save the working class and raise wages. Trump has done nothing but good (so far) for ALL American citizens. (Sucks that it hasn&#39;t been good for illegals but they are welcome back if they follow the rules.)</p>

<p>You sound like you really care about wages. Do you also support Sanctuary Cities and DACA? Illegal immigration lowers wages. Even Karl Marx wrote about how the Capitalists use the &quot;Unemployed Labor Army&quot; of immigrants to oppress the working class.</p>

<p>Illegal immigration oppresses the working class proletariat but liberals continue to use their privilege to fool you into voting for them. </p>

<p>How can Trump &quot;cut wages&quot;? lol. If someone doesn&#39;t have the skills to make $10 hour, then they don&#39;t deserve that money. Minimum wage is complete bullshit. If minimum wage worked, why not just make it $100/hour for everyone? Why doesn&#39;t anyone do that, can you answer? </p>

<p>Seattle literally just tried $15/hour and it HURT WORKERS. Proof: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/26/business/economy/seattle-minimum-wage.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/26/business/economy/seattle-minimum-wage.html</a></p>

<p>&quot;Socialism makes herd animals out of men&quot;, Nietzsche. Only the people that demand &quot;Equality for all!&quot; are cattle. Men are not equal and when we try to force it to be that way, everything collapses. Id rather have FREEDOM than free healthcare and free college.</p>

<p>Leftists want to be taken care of by Daddy. Conservatives want freedom and liberty. That&#39;s why I&#39;m on the right. I used to be full marxist in college, until I got out into the real world and actually had to earn a living for my family. How old are you? Do you have to provide for a wife and kids? </p>

<p>Do you remember this email to John podesta from Michael foreman. Foreman was the executive from Citibank during 08 presidential election and he sent podesta who was chair of Obama&#39;s transition team a list of people and the cabinet positions he wanted them in. Check the attachments. </p>

<p>The cabinet list ended up being almost entirely right. Holder for Justice Department, Napolitano for Homeland Security, Robert Gates for Defense, Rahm Emanuel for COS, Peter Orszag for OMB, Arne Duncan for Education, Eric Shinseki for Veterans Affairs, Kathleen Sebelius for HHS, Melody Barnes for the Domestic Policy Council, and more. For the Treasury, three possibilities were on the list: Robert Rubin, Larry Summers, and Timothy Geithner.</p>

<p>He sent this email on Oct 6 a full month before Obama was actually elected. So we have this executive from Citigroup who received the largest bailout during the financial crisis and he picks Obamas cabinet. </p>

<p>Do you think Obama ever wanted to see these Wall Street executives face charges or do you think he wanted to keep the &quot;too big to jail&quot; saying alive? </p>

</blockquote>

<p>What a disingenuous misreading of what I said. Because of the President&#39;s position in the legal system, it&#39;s basically impossible for the President to be &quot;found guilty of&quot; a crime outside of impeachment. Impeachment is the mechanism through which these crimes would be punished. So you&#39;re essentially saying &quot;You think Trump did something that deserves impeachment? How come he hasn&#39;t been impeached then HUH???&quot; You can&#39;t use whether he&#39;s been &quot;found guilty&quot; of these things as your baseline for whether he should even be suspected for them.</p>

<p>I say it&#39;s basically common knowledge that he <em>did</em> them because they are public actions that anyone can easily see happening. In the case of firing Comey being obstruction of justice, he even personally admitted his reasoning for doing it (to interfere with the Russia investigation targeting his campaign) in a publicly broadcasted interview.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They spied on Trump and his team for months, they have yet to put forward prof that Trump colluded with Putin and you still think they&#39;re going to find it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I hope this happened, but I haven&#39;t seen any proof of it yet. In fact, the Trump administration recently admitted that the accusation that Trump tower was wiretapped was a completely fabricated lie.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Come on man, if collusion happened they would have shown proof 9 months ago. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Depending on who had the proof, and at what time. Mueller&#39;s investigation is not complete, so there&#39;s no reason to believe that any unique information he has would be known by the public. Because it&#39;s not <em>supposed</em> to be. Saying &quot;if any proof exists, we would know about it&quot; is tantamount to saying &quot;it&#39;s impossible for any organization to keep information secret&quot;, which is pretty close to the conclusion &quot;conspiracies cannot exist&quot;, which I find very interesting for this sub.</p>

<p>The emoluments clause part is referring to the many business deals that have happened and profits he has had that coincide all to well with various statements and etc. Essentially this also brings up his unwillingness to put his businesses in a blind trust. This is, however, less clear cut than obstruction of justice.</p>

<p>He has not been sentenced of anything yet, but these things take a long ass time. There is clear evidence and admission that James Comey was fired for investigating ties to Russia. That is obstruction of justice. This is known.</p>

<p>Also, if you did a bit of searching outside of MSM bullshit shock jock reporting, you would have known about the financial fraud at Trump University, as well as the $10 fine his casino&#39;s received from FinCEN regarding money laundering violations.

    <div class="md"><p>You and I have different understandings of the Alfa Bank/ Trump Tower link. It was never used to conduct legitimate business. How do we know? There were only a handful of pings designed to hide the message being piggybacked on the signal. They happened within hours of trump making statements about new dirt to drop on Clinton and leaks being released. Those were the only times the servers talked to each other. </p>

<p>So your &#39;reasonable fact&#39; doesn&#39;t make any sense. </p>

<p>Within hours of jr sending the email saying &#39;I love me some Clinton dirt&#39; daddy big hands tweeted &#39;stay tuned big clinton dirt incoming&#39;. As far as the law is concerned it doesn&#39;t matter if it&#39;s attempted collusion that results in a nothing burger or attempted collusion that results in a big Wikileaks dump. </p>

<p>So it doesn&#39;t matter wether you think that&#39;s weak or not. The law doesn&#39;t really care what you think. </p>

<p>But, none of this really matters. You&#39;re one of the people agent orange talks about when he says &#39;I can shoot a motherfucker and the morons who follow me won&#39;t give a fuck&#39;.

<p>So not all legal experts, and Jr. has testified about this meeting so they are/were looking to charge him, they just have not done it yet. And if the info wasn&#39;t of value, why were they discussing &quot;russian adoption&quot; which is just code word for the magnitsky act, it makes it seem like they were giving them something back.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It doesn&#39;t matter what Trump said. He has the power to fire the FBI director for any reason. He can also pardon anyone for any reason so do pardons count as obstruction? No. Trump didn&#39;t say he wanted to stop the Russia investigation, in fact Comey&#39;s memo claimed that Trump told him it would be good to know if any of his staff did collude. The investigation is still ongoing and the actin director told the senate that Comey&#39;s firing had not obstructed the investigation. </p>
