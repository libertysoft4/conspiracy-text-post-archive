    <div class="md"><p>Invisible Pink Unicorns are beings of awesome mystical power. We know this because they manage to be invisible and pink at the same time. Like all religions, the Faith of the Invisible Pink Unicorns is based upon both logic and faith. We have faith that they are pink; we logically know that they are invisible because we can&#39;t see them. ~ Steve Eley</p>

<p>Man is certainly stark mad: he cannot make a worm, yet he will make gods by the dozen. ~ Michel de Montaigne</p>

<p>I contend that we are both atheists. I just believe in one fewer god than you do. When you understand why you dismiss all the other possible gods, you will understand why I dismiss yours. ~ Stephen Roberts</p>

<p>The philosopher has never killed any priests, whereas the priest has killed a great many philosophers. ~ Denis Diderot</p>

<p>All Bibles are man-made. ~ Thomas Edison</p>

<p>He who knows nothing is closer to the truth than he whose mind is filled with falsehoods and errors. ~ Thomas Jefferson</p>

<p>Religion is an insult to human dignity. With or without it, you&#39;d have good people doing good things and evil people doing bad things, but for good people to do bad things, it takes religion. ~ Steven Weinberg</p>

<p>Men who believe absurdities will commit atrocities. ~ Voltaire</p>

<p>It&#39;s not what you don&#39;t know that hurts you. It&#39;s what you know that just isn&#39;t so. ~ Satchel Paige</p>

<p>All natural institutions of churches, whether Jewish, Christian, or Turkish, appear to me no other than human inventions, set up to terrify and enslave mankind, and monopolize power and profit. ~ Thomas Paine</p>

<p>It is hard to free fools from chains they revere. ~ Voltaire</p>

<p>Religion, comprises a system of wishful illusions together with a disavowal of reality, such as we find in an isolated form nowhere else but in amentia, in a state of blissful hallucinatory confusion. ~ Sigmund Freud</p>

<p>Religion is the end of love and honesty, the beginning of confusion; faith is a colorful hope or fear, the origin of folly. ~ Tao Te Ching</p>

<p>A celibate clergy is an especially good idea, because it tends to suppress any hereditary propensity toward fanaticism. ~ Carl Sagan</p>

<p>Where it is a duty to worship the sun, it is pretty sure to be a crime to examine the laws of heat. ~ John Morley</p>

<p>If you pray for rain long enough, it eventually does fall. If you pray for floodwaters to abate, they eventually do. The same happens in the absence of prayers. ~ Steve Allen</p>

<p>If you believe in the existence of fairies at the bottom of the garden you are deemed fit for the bin. If you believe in parthenogenesis, ascension, transubstantiation and all the rest of it, you are deemed fit to govern the country. ~ Jonathan Meades</p>

<p>A man&#39;s ethical behavior should be based effectually on sympathy, education, and social ties and needs; no religious basis is necessary. Man would indeed be in a poor way if he had to be restrained by fear of punishment and hope of reward after death. ~ Albert Einstein</p>

<p>The most detestable wickedness, the most horrid cruelties, and the greatest miseries that have afflicted the human race have had their origin in this thing called revelation, or revealed religion. ~ Thomas Paine</p>

<p>Cast aside those who liken godliness to whimsy and who try to combine their greed for wealth with their desire for a happy afterlife. ~ Kahlil Gibran</p>

<p>When you call yourself an Indian or a Muslim or a Christian or a European, or anything else, you are being violent. Do you see why it is violent? It is because you are separating yourself from the rest of mankind. When you separate yourself by belief, by nationality, by tradition, it breeds violence. So a man who is seeking to understand violence does not belong to any country, to any religion, to any political party or partial system; he is concerned with the total understanding of mankind. ~ J. Krishnamurthi</p>

<p>Be happy while you&#39;re living, for you&#39;re a long time dead. ~ Scottish proverb</p>

<p>I saw a human skull the other day. There was an inscription below it: ‘Look long and hard at me, for I was once as you are and you will soon be as I am. ~ Unknown</p>

<p>The first clergyman was the first rascal who met the first fool. ~ Voltaire</p>

<p>I know of no crime that has not been defended by the church, in one form or other. The church is not a pioneer; it accepts a new truth, last of all, and only when denial has become useless. ~ Robert G. Ingersoll</p>

<p>Reality is that which, when you stop believing in it, doesn&#39;t go away. ~ Philip K. Dick</p>

<p>If you talk to God, you are praying. If God talks to you, you have schizophrenia. ~ Thomas Szasz</p>

<p>When did I realize I was God? Well, I was praying and I suddenly realized I was talking to myself. ~ Jack Gurney - &quot;The Ruling Class&quot;</p>

<p>Isn&#39;t killing people in the name of God a pretty good definition of insanity? ~ Arthur C. Clarke</p>

<p>Secular schools can never be tolerated because such schools have no religious instruction, and a general moral instruction without a religious foundation is built on air; consequently, all character training and religion must be derived from faith ... we need believing people. ~ Adolf Hitler</p>

<p>Which is it, is man one of God&#39;s blunders or is God one of man&#39;s? ~ Nietzsche</p>

<p>Each nation knowing it has the only true religion and the only sane system of government, each despising all the others, each an ass and not suspecting it. ~ Mark Twain</p>

<p>The Church says that the earth is flat, but I know that it is round, for I have seen its shadow on the moon, and I have more faith in a shadow than in the Church. ~ Robert G. Ingersoll Quoting Ferdinand Magellan - no citation</p>

<p>Could a being create the fifty billion galaxies, each with two hundred billion stars, then rejoice in the smell of burning goat flesh? ~ Ron Patterson</p>

<p>Science has done more for the development of western civilization in one hundred years than Christianity did in eighteen hundred years.
~ Jeff Burroughs</p>

<p>I read about an Eskimo hunter who asked the local missionary priest, ‘If I did not know about God and sin, would I go to hell?’ ‘No,’ said the priest, ‘not if you did not know.’ ‘Then why,’ asked the Eskimo earnestly, ‘did you tell me?’ ~ Annie Dillard</p>

<p>I sometimes think that God in creating man somewhat overestimated his ability.
~ Oscar Wilde</p>

<p>Knowledge comes, but wisdom lingers. ~ Alfred, Lord Tennyson</p>

<p>I don’t really miss God, but I sure miss Santa Claus! ~ Courtney Love</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Atheism just means that an individual doesn&#39;t believe in any deities which are all thought up/made by people.  A lot of that comes from the bull shit people have seen revolving around religions.  If you look at it from a practical sense you do not need to adhere to a god to live in this world and and to be a good person.  I imagine most atheists don&#39;t trust government either as it appears to be a corrupt controlling entity like some religions.  It is probably also true that the highest authority for an atheist is one&#39;s self and they will adhere to their own morals in everyday life. </p>

<p>They wouldn&#39;t be atheist and renounce all other religions if they were rule abiding.  </p>

<p>They make up PC rules that they follow:
What PC rules did atheists makes?</p>

<p>They&#39;re not free thinkers:
Explain this one to me because it makes no sense.  They would be free thinkers if they stuck around with mainstream religions?</p>

<p>They&#39;re followers:
Atheism itself directly contradicts this.  They literally chose to follow no other religions.</p>

<p>I&#39;m generally left leaning and atheist and own guns and hang out with similar people who own guns and shoot. In fact, a bunch of us went out and sighted in some rifles this weekend.</p>

<p>Why do you think they want guns banned?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Atheists don&#39;t want guns banned... In fact only a small percentage of the country wants guns banned. The noise about it comes from a small subset of soccer moms, a small subset of college students, and a large subset of sociopathic politicians who control the media and most polls.</p>
