What event would force alien disclosure? We should try to keep in the realms of possibility here but the floor is open to any sort to suggestion that would realistically result in the government or whoever to admit the existence of aliens and/or our contact with them.  </p>

<p>For example,  a large mob storming Area 51 streaming cell phone footage. Before I get shouted down with &#39;there&#39;s only military planes there&#39; it&#39;s an example to highlight what could potentially do it.  The most likely example would be the leak of documents or media, that proves the existence of any sort of secret space program, through a medium like WikiLeaks. Again, not perfect, just an example. </p>

<p>Has anyone thought about this over the years?  </p>

<p>What is there to explain?  Every observation, measurement and experiment demonstrates that the Earth is spherical and convex.  Claiming anything else is distraction-based nonsense pushed to get people to look away from the underpinning problems in society.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t have any alts, what are you getting on about?  This sub has seen progressively increasing subscriber rates as the demand to know the truth grows, this goes hand in hand with more people calling you out on your disinfo nonsense.  No need for alts to call you out when anybody with a basic understanding of the world around them will do the same.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It could be that no matter how far you look into space, you&#39;ll always see more and more infinite, mostly empty space because that is the <em>design.</em> If beings built this place to make or preserve life, this is what they night do to give the illusion of expansive space when in reality there is nothing out there. I don&#39;t necessarily believe this, but it&#39;s a possibility, and an answer to your question. If that&#39;s the case, we don&#39;t know who designed it anymore than we could know why the big bang happened, and in either belief system, we know very little of what reality is or why the universe exists.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that we know very little about it. But if you speak of reality, you can&#39;t ignore the fact that we have a solid third-density understanding of our surroundings, and that when you look through a telescope you can see light from (what appears to be) another galaxy. </p>

<p>Yes we can view this as an illusion, but then we need to present an alternative explanation that goes beyond &quot;it&#39;s the design&quot;. How does it work?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know we have a good understanding, but part of science is that it is forever open to new understandings as they come up (discoveries, experiments, etc). As an observant private citizen, however, I question some of main stream science (admittedly, some of that is mere ignorance of science teachings). </p>

<p>For instance, if we are going 600 million miles per hour, how can the stars stay put in the sky (spinning around Polaris in perfect predictable circles) for thousands of years to the point that ancient people played connect the dots with them to form drawings which we <em>still use</em> today? Why aren&#39;t they, and those other galaxies, moving at such speeds in all directions? A possibility: the light from the other galaxies could be just that: light, as in light on a TV screen (impossibly complex to us). If we can&#39;t explain what exactly gravity is, then the entire premise of balls of gas attracting balls of rock way out there in space is built on theories and assumptions. Therefore, we could be looking at little balls and glowing dots put there for reasons as unknown as the reason the big bang happened (as science preaches), and to question them is like questioning what was there before the big bang: there is much we don&#39;t know.</p>

<p>Scientists wonder: how does it work. Some things we may never know. Why are we here? To a scientist or philosopher, it is moot. But anyone can guess and come up with a possible reason: beings, such as humans or unimaginable to us, may have preserved life (for reasons unknown, perhaps a catastrophe of sorts) on a vast plane of water and land, designed to replicate indefinitely under a shield (with infinite hologram), with a ball of finite feul rotating above. How does that shield work? We may find out, or never know. That&#39;s a simple answer.</p>

<p>An &quot;illusion&quot; is an easy way out, I admit. But a potential reality, nonetheless.</p>
