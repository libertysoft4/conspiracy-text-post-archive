        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>If I was an intelligence agency that had thousands of data points on every citizen and could intercept and monitor what everyone was doing online, I would be compiling all of that information into a database to create behavior and personality profiles on everyone.</p>

<p>From there I&#39;d want to create maps of how information flowed between certain personality types and chart how behavior is affected. </p>

<p>One thing I&#39;d definitely want to know is how easily lies are believed, what kinds of lies are believed, how they spread, and who spreads them. A great way to test this would be to come up with something very bizarre but seems like it could maybe be true. </p>

<p>I&#39;d create a few dozen youtube videos about how the earth is &quot;flat&quot;, give odd examples that appeal to people&#39;s immediate observations and not scientific process, and then start posting them to sites like reddit, facebook, forums, ect. </p>

<p>After a year or two, you&#39;ll now have a whole new set of data points on how false information can be spread, which videos worked the best, which points in the videos have been repeated the most, and what demographic of people believed them and shared them.</p>

<p>From there you have a new avenue to spread false information. Better yet, you can create a new experiment based on the data you&#39;ve collected from the old one and try to slowly perfect your ability to control the beliefs of a huge number of people. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My family member later eventually started running around on the street, yelling green green green. And then made his children stay home because he thought all food outside of the house was poisoned and that the government was out to get them. A few days later, the house became haunted, and he made his family stay at his mom&#39;s house. A week or two later, he told his wife that he has to kill himself in order to make a sacrifice to God and to save his kids.</p>

<p>He wasn&#39;t always like this, but a few years prior to this he was normal, but flatearth beliefs was the first sign of something wrong.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>there are so many different ways to respond to what you&#39;re saying, but the pure and simple truth is our society is sick and extremely fucked up. </p>

<p>We&#39;re prescribed pills that fuck with our bodies/minds, most of the food we are sold is poison is some form or another, even &#39;organic&#39; food isn&#39;t safe. </p>

<p>I wonder if you were there and actually saw all of this with your own eyes and ears or if they were just second hand stories from other people who said they saw it. The reason I bring this up is because I know of others who had been accused of &#39;going crazy&#39; and the reality is the family was lying or exaggerating what was happening because they were scared. Not saying this is the case, but it happens. </p>

<p>Even if this was the case, why the break down? you say he wasn&#39;t always like this, but &#39;normal&#39; so what happened? new medication, stresses from work/money? I mean really, FB or other internet services could have programs that &#39;trigger&#39; people to go &#39;crazy&#39;, we know that FB and Twitter run manipulation systems to get people to feel/think about certain things, maybe he watched a youtube video that scrambled his brains?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was there. I was close to this family member. Everyone in the family hated him, but I always tried to give him a second chance.</p>

<p>I was the one trying to help his family get him to seek help, but he refused to do so until it was too late.</p>

<p>They said he had bipolar mixed with something else. The changes started to happen when he got into a car accident and had major head trauma. He recovered and seemed ok. </p>

<p>Then he started working night shift every night for several years and wasn&#39;t really sleeping much.</p>

<p>I personally think the trauma from the car crash and the lack of sleep and stress about taking care of his family drove him off the deep end. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was the major head trauma. You hardly ever recover to the person you were, ever. </p>

<p>Guaranteed he was on some prescription pills. </p>

<p>This not a mystery, he wasn&#39;t crazy, there are just somethings it&#39;s incredibly hard to heal from. I would bet if you found out the drugs he was on and looked them up, the side effects correlate to what was happening :/ </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a weak attempt at trying to discredit flat earth theory.</p>

<p>Subtle manipulation only works on non critical thinkers.  </p>

<p>By taking the stance that flat earth is an assumed absurdity you can move past it without going into any actual scientific analysis.</p>

<p>This post of your &quot;theory&quot; is completely worhtless, except as an attempt to divert people&#39;s attention away from looking at flat earth seriously. Shame on you.</p>

<p>Anyone who has honestly looked at the evidence can make their own conclusions without your pathetic validation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s very simple. Pilots need to calculate their fuel pretty much exactly when they&#39;re making long trips. Fuel weighs a lot. If you over fuel, the plane will be to heavy to reach the destination and they&#39;ll either have to dump the fuel over the ocean, or return to the airport to de-fuel. If you&#39;re flying halfway around the globe on a 16 hour flight, you need your fuel calculations to be 100% perfect.</p>

<p>And you know one of the things they factor in when they&#39;re navigating long trips? The curvature of the earth, because a curved line is longer than a short one. Source: my father, the career pilot, teaching me how planes navigate while we were on a trip together and he was flying the plane. </p>

<p>Of course, I assume you&#39;ll tell me that my dad is in on the conspiracy. That every single pilot in the world is in on the conspiracy.</p>

<p>Not to mention the fact that we have damned icecaps which exist because those area of the planet receive the least amount of sunlight.</p>

<p>Or the fact that we have seasons. </p>

<p>Or that we can launch satellites which orbit the globe. </p>

<p>Or the fact that when I was in highschool we launched a weather balloon with a camera to take space pictures and could clearly see the curvature of the earth. </p>

<p>Or the laws of physics. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is some ignorant shit right there. The most funny and ironic thing I have realized since I went flat 2.5 years ago is that the customary mockery that most do you are honestly only mocking yourselves. Flat earth is truth regardless of what jokes you want to crack. However from my perspective you all look/sound like the assclowns in idiocracy cracking jokes on the only intelligent character in the film. You will never get it I fear, you will fall for all the lies that ball earth is based on. I mean you folks came from monkeys 🐒 so really there is not much I can do other than help those that get it. I have converted hundreds and not one of them has ever come back to me and said yeah man you are wrong the earth is a ball. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have proven it nobody cares to even look at the evidence. Thousands of YouTube videographers have proven it. Water never bends. Polaris never moves. Perspucular rays prove it. Double rainbows prove it as the second rainbow is always inverted as it reflects off the dome. Oahu can be seen 90 miles away which would be impossible as the curvature would be a miles worth. Chicago skyline can be seen across Lake Michigan at 60 miles away. Horizons would not be flat. Googling earth from space one would see a real picture of earth. We would not have cartoons from weather channels but would see a realtime spin of the earth and everyone would watch the earth channel and see realtime weather patterns you could put an iPhone in orbit to accomplish this but you will NEVER see it because its impossible. I fly every week and take pictures at 7-8 miles high and never a curve to be found. So I speak truth to everywhere I go and have personally converted hundreds of people.  I don&#39;t do this for recognition I do it to free humanity from a tyrannical government who first lied to you in Kindergarten. Just spend an honest day researching it for yourself. Drop everything you think you know as Aristotle suggests and start like it was the forst day on this earth and realize your reality that&#39;s all I ask. I cannot prove it to you it must be proven by you. Don&#39;t look for debunking videos but rather proof videos. Flat earth proofs should be your search. </p>

Citing bullshit is not science measuring and actually doing science is science. Either experiment for yourself or shut the fuck up as it&#39;s annoyingly painful hearing the same exact shit I bought and learned. I know ALL of the global models, fake distances to stars, fake planets, fake galaxies, their distances across. I was once a left brained scientism worshipper too. I have for the last 2.5 years dedicated my life to flat earth vs ball earth research. Ball earth is just pseudoscience that relies on assumptions and math. Math is a language to describe and predict reality it is not reality.

<p>No need to, you are unable to explain the following:</p>

<li>sunrise going from south-north in the Southern Hemisphere and north-south in the Northern Hemisphere</li>

<li>different constellations in each Hemisphere</li>
<li>sun setting below the horizon without getting smaller</li>
<li>certain constellations disappearing below the horizon as you go from the Northern to Southern Hemisphere and vice versa</li>
</ul>

<p>But I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll wave all this away and talk about your personal experiments which lack any kind of evidence and that I seriously doubt you actually have the mental capacity to accurately conduct.</p>

<p>Care to provide a link to this &quot;study&quot;? Just making a claim that this study happened isn&#39;t enough. It&#39;s this magical thing called proof, which you never provide. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Question; how would you expect the horizon to curve yet still meet up at eye level behind you on <em>any</em> shape of earth? Geometry suggests that being this close to a huge ball will result in a flat horizon to the observer.

<p>You sure do get aggressive when it&#39;s demonstrated that you have no clue what you&#39;re talking about, why are you getting so angry when you&#39;re so certain of something?  Why are you unable to explain how the Belt of Venus works on a flat Earth?  How did you not come across the Belt of Venus in your previous &quot;research&quot; and are now hearing about it for the first time?</p>
