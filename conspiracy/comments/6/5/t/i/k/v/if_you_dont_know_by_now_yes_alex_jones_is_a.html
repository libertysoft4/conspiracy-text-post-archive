<p>TPTP handling 🍕gate knew that if they used their limited hangout messiah of the conspiracy movement (jones) as bait, and he backed away from 🍕gate, they hoped ALL his supporters and the conspiracy community at large would also walk away from it, assuming it&#39;s fake. </p>

<p>&quot;Well, Alex Jones said it was fake, so it must be right?&quot;.</p>

<p>Didn&#39;t work out as they planned. AJ&#39;s followers were PISSED and unsubscribed and called his ass out. He&#39;s definitely a limited hangout guys. Don&#39;t give me this &quot;he was threatened with a suit&quot; or &quot;his family was threatened&quot; shit. He ALWAYS backs down when we have something legitimately detrimental to the system. They use him as an &quot;insider&quot;, to steer us away from investigating important information. Fuck Jones. We have to do this on our own. </p>

This is bigger than the Podesta emails for this horrible evil disgusting tradition on the world&#39;s children has been going on since time immemorial. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/georgwebb">George Webb</a> has a good channel that follows the money trail with Dyncorp, the Clinton&#39;s shenanigans, human trafficking connected with...well, everything from human organ harvesting to chemical agent and vaccine testing (especially with what seems to be going on in Haiti right now).

        Anyway, trying not to feel discouraged for the reddit community has been more aggressive than ever (positively and negatively) as have the major networks that most people ingest their slant on what&#39;s going on in the outside world.  Buzz words abound more than ever where everything is a &quot;-gate&quot;, narratives and news have to be on one side or the other.  &quot;Fake news&quot; clouds opposed opinions and facts while being diluted and dismissed with knee jerk reactions from the magical phrase &quot;CONSPIRACY THEORY/THEORIST&quot;&#39;.  Then the surreal open admittance the social elitism, secret societies, and people don&#39;t seem to bat an eye because of the social conditioning an apathetic &quot;that&#39;s just the way it is&quot; mentality.

    <div class="md"><p>Perhaps I should apologize for not being clear on emphasizing what I was saying was evil and disgusting.  Not political opinions but the alleged acts of human trafficking, sex trade, etc.  I mistakenly assumed since the expanded uproar of Jones&#39; alienation  mostly caused by his retention into the whole P-Gate thing, was likely the catalyst for the Original poster&#39;s post.<br/>
          I think I gave a pretty broad feeling that a lot of people would at least empathize or somewhat agree with and certainly not enough to immediately know what my political opinion is.<br/>
        Also, I don&#39;t think I was demonstrating anything selfish except for maybe wanting my voice heard. The link to a channel I gave would help show how much bigger it is than solely P-Gate.<br/>
          In conclusion, I apologize for not being clear.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>BECAUSE of a lawsuit that threatened to take him down.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There was no actual lawsuit though, only the potential for a lawsuit. Nothing was ever filed, and he never set foot in a courtroom. As stated in his apology, his retraction was in response to a letter from Alefantis. Under <a href="http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/CP/htm/CP.73.htm">Sec. 73.055</a> of Texas state law (Jones is based in Austin), a plaintiff must have requested &quot;Correction, Clarification, or Retraction,&quot; <strong>before</strong> suing for defamation.</p>

<p>Jones could have used any of those three options in response to the defamation accusations, so why choose to retract? Does he not have enough evidence to back up his claims, or does he just not care? Either way it says a lot about his character IMO, and he comes off as a huge pushover.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s likely that the source of the lawsuit isn&#39;t even something he put up directly, but was put up under the Infowars banner.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m sure you&#39;re right, and their are many parts of his apology that reference things &#39;we&#39; did. But there are also parts where he personally apologizes:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In our commentary about what became known as Pizzagate, <strong>I made comments about Mr. Alefantis that in hindsight I regret</strong>, and for which I apologize to him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>These are all good points.  However, consider this:  Jones is already in a court/custody battle with his ex-wife.  He is likely lawsuit-averse at this point in time.  His lawyer might have suggested he punt this one.  And I wouldn&#39;t be surprised that the wording of his apology was crafted in part by his lawyer.  </p>

<p>It is not out of the realm of possibility that Jones is controlled opposition, but many of the facts on this sub are half-truths or false.  It may be a case of trying to peel back layers that don&#39;t exist.</p>

<p>Yes. He has no evidence. None of them do. If they did, why don&#39;t we have the evidence? Period. </p>

<p>I have a question: what does it say about conservatives that you think that people who have a slightly different political philosophy than yours are all wicked? </p>

<p>American Liberals, for the most part, like capitalism, they support much lower taxes than even the conservative parties in other countries, they believe in civil rights but also want to see criminals punished.</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s the fact that you feel a little bit guilty for your political philosophy, one that completely rejects collective action and is inherently selfish, so you try to project that onto others.</p>

<p>I am sure Hillary Clinton has done a lot of indefensible shit. I think that is common trait for any leader. But the fact that you people just seem to think that she is some constantly scheming supervillain says more about you than it does about her.</p>

<p>Could you prove pizzagate in a court with a fair judge? No? Then shut the fuck up, please. Just take your nutropics and plant some seeds and shut your trap. You have no right to try to make everyone else as miserable as you feel.</p>

<p>And that was my point: he <strong>doesn&#39;t</strong> have evidence to justify the claims he made, which is why he chose to issue a retraction instead of defending himself in court.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But this is just the tip of a shit iceberg. The amount of paranoid bullshit slung by right-wing conspiracists is ridiculous. These people only care about selling seeds and the only way to sell seeds is to reinforce paranoia.</p>

<p>The by-product of always crying wolf is that nobody believes you when there is actually a wolf. The fact that the reporting of a so-called conspiracy got so far on such flimsy evidence is proof of just how paranoid they are. Its convenient that nearly all of the paranoia is directed at their political enemies.</p>

<p>Look, I think being an American conservative is pretty damn dumb and selfish. Still, I think that most conservative politicians are probably trying hard within their belief system to do the right thing. These conspiracists on the other hand play politics like the worst kinds of football fans. The kind that cheer when the opposing players get injured. The kind that break into hotels and pull the visiting team&#39;s fire alarm.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not trying to convert anyone or anything, but it makes me furious that someone like Alex Jones can get rewarded once for absolutely inventing a conspiracy out of thin air, and then, get rewarded again when he apologizes for it. I&#39;m not even angry at him, really. I&#39;m angry that there are millions of people who are polluting my country who can be fleeced by nutropics con men.</p>

<p>No, he&#39;s a businessman, staying rich by keeping his listeners on the edge of their seats...telling them precisely as they expect to hear. Ask yourself what would happen to his &quot;business&quot; if his theories started having definitive answers and conclusions.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>TPTP handling 🍕gate knew that if they used their limited hangout messiah of the conspiracy movement (jones) as bait, and he backed away from 🍕gate, they hoped ALL his supporters and the conspiracy community at large would also walk away from it, assuming it&#39;s fake.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No one was handling anything. It was/is an accusation that ran wild on the internet, demonizing the democratic party during an election. Not even that had much effect. You guys can&#39;t convince a conspiracy board, yet think &quot;TPTB&quot; took interest on that scale? Not even close. Defaming a couple powerful people sure, but their actions in response are not surprising. What would you do if your neighbors started telling people you molest kids or are a rapist? Pretty serious accusations, and hard to wash that stink off once it&#39;s on. You&#39;d likely have to move. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>He&#39;s definitely a limited hangout</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Limited hangout, controlled opposition, shill, false flag, etc. You sound like an uneducated teenager by using such terms and it doesn&#39;t help bolster whatever you&#39;re trying to relay. Really, it sounds stupid.</p>

<p>He ALWAYS backs down when we have something legitimately detrimental to the system</p>

<p>Again, he&#39;s a businessman. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>They use him as an &quot;insider&quot;, to steer us away from investigating important information.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Who&#39;s they? And why would you consider what you&#39;re doing an &quot;investigation&quot;. It&#39;s not, and has bore no fruit.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We have to do this on our own.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And you&#39;ll continue to spin your wheels, relying upon the fact no one can disprove something that has not yet established substance. Continue to ignore the burden of proof and instead toss it upon people with questions. Continue to use the &quot;kid&quot; aspect as a means to ride the empathy/heart strings bus into oblivion.</p>

<p>YOU want someone powerful to go to jail. To go down. To be taught a lesson. A win for the people! This isn&#39;t about kids or sex trafficking, stop kidding yourself. It&#39;s about the conspiracy crowd finally knocking someone of authority down a notch, and this has a unique way of gaining support: &quot;Don&#39;t you care about the kids?&quot;--&quot;Must be a pedo..&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>At the Nashville rally, Trump cited Dershowitz&#39;s statement on MSNBC when talking about the ruling, which he called &quot;terrible.&quot;
&quot;Even liberal Democratic lawyer Alan Dershowitz, good lawyer, just said that we would win this case before the Supreme Court of the United States,&quot; Trump said.) at rally (in regards to the travel ban (<a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/president-trump-alan-dershowitz-travel-ban-muslims-2017-3">Source</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>AND his <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2017/02/alexander-acosta-trump-jeffrey-epstein-plea-235096">pick for secretary of labor</a> was the federal prosecutor that cut Epstein a (pretty inappropriate) deal in his underage sex case.</p>

<p>As someone who disliked both Trump &amp; Clinton, I tried mentioning this all to my Trump-supporting friend(s) before and it&#39;s like they block it out &amp; I&#39;m speaking another language.</p>
