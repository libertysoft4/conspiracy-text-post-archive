        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Assad denies attacking his own people and says these claims are simply to fit the West narrative since ISIS is seriously losing the battle outside of a big front in Aleppo. </p>

<p>Further he says the claims about accidentally bombing his own schools and hospitals can&#39;t be true because those targets rely on precision targeting. Finally, he mentioned a gas attack would mean massive civilian casualties which didn&#39;t happen.</p>

<p>This whole thing is a hoax. ISIS is getting their asses kicked by Assad and Russia so the West is upset about it because they rely on ISIS to remove Assad so that the west can install another puppet President under the Rothschild banner. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for a thoughtful response. They seem to hold all parties accountable when it comes to this stuff, meaning they have criticized the Obama administration as much as they are or will criticize the Trump administration. </p>

<p>This sub definitely raises some valid points with some of this stuff, for example, countries that are being invaded that do not have central banks. However, the &quot;false flag&quot; idea in this scenario seems off. </p>

<p>Lastly, not to stir the pot and create the proverbial shit storm, but this sub has definitely been compromised therefore, making a &quot;false flag&quot; scenario in regards to the use of chemical weapons seem that much more suspect. At least when presented in this context. The Assad&#39;s have several decades of history suggesting they would have no qualms gassing their own people. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe the chemical weapons attack was a false flag executed by the rebels or the US. As with most everyone, I think it doesn&#39;t make sense for Assad use chemical weapons when he was winning.</p>

<p>HOWEVER, I can think of one reason Assad might use chemical weapons when winning so handily: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Saddam gave up his chemical weapons, and was attacked soon after. </p></li>
<li><p>Gaddafi gave up his chemical weapons and was attacked soon after.</p></li>
<li><p>Disarming a country of chemical weapons looks like it may be the first stage of a planned US invasion.</p></li>
<li><p>It&#39;s possible that Assad used chemical weapons exactly because he was winning. Could be he was worried the US would invade, either in response to his winning or because he had evidence of a planned invasion. </p></li>
<li><p>Letting the US know he still had chemical weapons would probably keep the US out of Syria. </p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>Can you present a plausible scenario for how this could be a false flag? I do not believe the US would be able to do this, it would require too many people to outright lie. We&#39;re talking radar technicians, intelligence analysts, special forces on the ground. Plus, this wasn&#39;t some covert operation with no witnesses, like Tonkin. Many witnesses on the ground reported seeing Russian made Jets on the attack. And they were traced from that airfield. And we picked up communications regarding the chemical usage at around the time of their use. And we have the British now too examining the evidence.  I just find it almost impossible to believe this could be faked. </p>

<p>Now, the only evidence I&#39;ve seen for it being faked is a lack of motive. And I think many people who are saying that lack an expertise in military statescraft or international politics. To me it is far more likely that Russia okayed the operation specifically so the US could respond, which they knew we would, to artificially sour Us/Russian relations, which takes heat off the administration, and gives them more flexibility in negotiating with the Russians. We also know that in the days leading up to the gas attack the administration basically stated that regime change was not a priority and that Assad would have a role in rebuilding the country. Simplicity says this could embolden Assad to carry out the attack, thinking the US stance has changed. A grave miscalculation obviously, but a not so unreasonable one.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, the scenario is, the warehouse was bombed because it was known to be a rebel held asset. This does not imply previous knowledge of chemical weapons being stored there. The CIA bought old chem missiles from an unknown Iraqi source during O.I.F. in 2006. The U.S. currently needs an excuse to go and invade Syria, as their backed &quot;rebels&quot; aren&#39;t succeeding in the war against the Syrian Army. It&#39;s totally plausible that they&#39;ve placed these missiles in prime rebel targets across Syria as to create the whole &quot;Assad is gassing his people&quot; scenario.</p>

<p>Gaddafi had completely disarmed. Wikileaks has Hillary emails saying exactly that. They also indicate that Gaddafi is willing to do most anything else demanded of him. Hillary instructed her staff to ignore him and his overtures. </p>

<p>The US doesn&#39;t actually care about people being gassed to death. Remember, they helped Saddam use chemical weapons on over 300,000 Iranian soldiers. They only care when the weapons might be used on them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Syria ain&#39;t the US or Europe.</p>

<p>Syria has the problem of &quot;diversity&quot; - there are multiple groups in Syria and they do not get along. Racial, ethnic, and cultural diversity is terrible and ALWAYS leads to conflicts.</p>

<p>Assad may be a dictator by Western standards, but he&#39;s the only thing that is keeping the Syrian minorities like the Alawites and the Christians from being slaughtered by the Muslim majorities.</p>

<p>If you brought democracy to Syria, you would get a President that would likely start mass genocides - and probably would then set himself up as a dictator anyway.</p>

<p>The USA has no problem with dictators - our Second Best Ally Saudi Arabia is nothing but a dictatorship.</p>

<p>But Israel wants Syrian destroyed, so therefore Assad is a Bad Guy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why on this thread are we more inclined to believe madmen like Assad rather than the legitimate governments and institutions of the world? What has Assad done for Syria other than bleed it dry? Why are we believing him now? Was he ever known to be a very credible and honest man?</p>

<p>I know we don&#39;t want to get dragged into another war - and we must resist this as much as we can - but it&#39;s painful to see so many people justify the murdered and butcher of children. There are millions of Syrian refugees in turkey and across Europe right now, they&#39;re real and you can all go see/talk to them right now. They all have stories of torture and war crimes even though they don&#39;t all coordinate stories (how could a man in Paris who ever met the refugee in southern turkey have a similar story of war crimes even though they weren&#39;t even in the same city in Syria?), they can&#39;t all be &quot;terrorists&quot; because so many of them are Christian/children/elderly/women. They were just innocents caught between the forces of civil war, Isis was created by Assad when he opened the prisons and let the known jihadists free in the north so they could fight assads free Syrian army rebels. </p>

<p>Assad is a tyrant, an enemy to all of us who hate oppressive government. If any of you were stuck in assads prisons and tortured to death simply for being a male aged 11 to 70, you&#39;d realize he was lying right before you died. Can we please stop justifying his war crimes? Yes the CIA does fucked up things but no, not every tyrant is a false flag attack. Some dictators are just evil - that&#39;s what Assad is, that&#39;s what Hitler was, same with Stalin and Mao. </p>

<p>The only way to find out who did it , is through an independent investigation who is not be biased pro or anti anything and ONLY THEN anyone can claim to KNOW who did it. Until then everyone needs to be honest and say it as it is = WE DON&#39;T KNOW. Period.</p>

<p>There are motivations enough for a number of countries to do it, but this should not be based on speculations. So everyone needs to STOP speculating and start investigating. </p>

<p>What we are witnessing on the media is only propaganda, whether its PRO or ANTI Assad and both are just as bad. Thise people have been killed in an awful way JUST FOR THE SAKE OF PROPAGANDA so lets stop provoking it. </p>
