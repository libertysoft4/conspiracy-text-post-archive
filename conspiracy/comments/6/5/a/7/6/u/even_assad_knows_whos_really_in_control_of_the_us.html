<p>&quot;…I was very cautious in saying any opinion regarding him before he became President and after. I always say let’s see what he’s going to do, we wouldn’t comment on statements. So, actually, this is the first proof that it’s not about the President in the United State; it’s about the regime and the deep state or the deep regime in the United States is still the same, it doesn’t change. The President is only one of the performers on their theatre, if he wants to be a leader, he cannot, because as some say he wanted to be a leader, Trump wanted to be a leader, but every President there, if he wants to be a real leader, later he’s going to eat his words, swallow his pride if he has pride at all, and make a 180 degree U-turn, otherwise he would pay the price politically”.</p>

<p><a href="https://theduran.com/4-key-points-from-president-assads-first-post-attack-interview/">https://theduran.com/4-key-points-from-president-assads-first-post-attack-interview/</a></p>

<p>The whole world probably knows who&#39;s really in control. Trump didn&#39;t reverse on any policies, he just learned his place like a good little boy. That&#39;s why every president is essentially the same as the last one. There is no left or right, democrat or republican. It&#39;s all an illusion to make you feel like you have a choice. </p>

<p>It&#39;s generally easier to guess Putin&#39;s intentions as he&#39;s pretty overt in his speeches and actions, and he&#39;s been at the helm of Russia for 17 years now, so he&#39;s been able to play the long game, and he&#39;s been pretty consistent in his goals.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The US imprisons more people per head of population than any other country on earth, including North Korea. In prison, they are treated as slave labour, making consumer products while law-abiding Americans are unemployed.</p>

<p>The US is 31 on the list of nations ranked by life expectancy, behind nations like Greece and Slovenia.</p>

<p>In the world&#39;s richest nation, 13% live in poverty with over 600,000 homeless people wandering the streets. 44% of those homeless people are employed in some capacity. Recent census data suggests half of the American population qualifies as poor or low income.</p>

<p>In June 2016, the IMF warned the nation that spends 600 billion dollars a year on its military that poverty needed to be tackled urgently by raising the minimum and offering paid maternity leave.</p>

<p>I&#39;d say that the US could use some pity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yeah ok keep saying what you&#39;re saying because all know whatever shithole country you&#39;re sitting in if you say the wrong thing you can be fined or thrown in prison lmfao, even if it&#39;s western european.</p>

<p>and if you&#39;re an american then you&#39;re just a dumbfuck ignorant about what the rest of the world is like. you don&#39;t like it here? go somewhere else. see how much fucking worse it is kiddo. see how everyone bends over and gets fucked in the ass by the government.</p>

<p>to say &quot;americans worship their leaders&quot; or &quot;uniquely engage in cult of personality&quot; is fucking stupid about a nation that literally has armed fucking militias set up that are at the ready to stand up to the fucking government at a moments notice if it gets out of line (bundy ranch, anyone?). oh and is there a &quot;sovereign citizens&quot; movement in fucking iran? or africa (outside of primitive tribes that are allowed to remain &quot;free&quot; by government degree)? or even god damn europe? no? didn&#39;t think so. </p>

<p>and europe is totally left-wing, which literally means growing government and giving it more power and responsibility. </p>

<p>the fucking stupidity of what you&#39;re saying is massively off the fucking charts. <strong>massively</strong>. you can &quot;wah wah muh kool-aid&quot; all you want, but that doesn&#39;t change the fact that what you are saying is <strong>undeniably an irrevocably factually untrue</strong>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yeah because we have working police force, that you can&#39;t just slip a benjamin to in order to recuse yourself of any sort of investigation, and we don&#39;t execute massive numbers of people, you ignorant tard. we also have the financial resources to house criminals in ways that many other nations don&#39;t, which means fucking zimbabwe doesn&#39;t have a lower prison population &quot;because they&#39;re more free&quot; or anything, idiot. we also don&#39;t do mob justice here (except on the front page of reddit, home of retards who love to congregate here). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes.
I am sure.</p>

<p>Just because you can point out a theory which has some fitting aspects of our current world, and how the USA fits into it, does not mean it is accurate.</p>

<p>In the USA we have seen a slide towards corporate power. A problem that we, as a people, can fix. But much like the Declaration of Independence states that a people aren&#39;t likely to revolt until extreme discomfort is imposed upon them, a similar such scenario must take place for the public to care enough to get properly involved in the government as such to impose certain changes that would tip the balance of control back to the people and away from corporations and the ultra rich.</p>

<p>That being said, I have seen what other countries are like. Others who have seen far more than I have also agree with me, in the USA we experience a freedom unlike that anywhere else in the world. And not only that, opportunity like noplace else.  Most native born Americans are blind to it. Instead they complain about corporate greed, and a lack of jobs. Meanwhile an immigrant opens a shop and provides a comfortable life for his family, buys their first home and puts a couple kids through college...  </p>

<p>America is full of problems, but it&#39;s still the best overall game on the planet for those who are willing to work for what they want.</p>
