<p>Not saying that they don&#39;t. But the point is that any person online can say anything. </p>

<p>You would think this would be obvious but it isn&#39;t considering how many times that comment was upvoted and &quot;gilded&quot;. </p>

<p>Once again, I personally do believe a bomb went off but have my own theories about the how and the why. So I am not claiming that people were not injured and I am not claiming that the person who said they &quot;know people&quot; is lying.</p>

<p>But what I am saying is that a person upvoted into the thousands and gilded multiple times, solely for starting their comment with &quot;I personally know people...&quot; is a load of BS and should be addressed.</p>

I understand that the Boston bombing has many witnesses (although thousands upvotes and gold raise some flags, but I mean generally, not that particular comment).

But on the other hand all you people claiming it never happened and all the victims were invented can eat a dick too. I might listen to the shooter was MK or the CIA or Mossad did it. But the whole school never existed is going full potato. It&#39;s the no-planes-at-all-its-a-hologram retarded. Rather than debate all these lunatics it must be very tempting to just say you are a family member. </p>

If anyone parroting this shit would get off their ass and look into it, its very, very easy to debunk this nonsensical idea. You could easily find parents of kids that went to that school. It would take you a few hours, tops. But no one cares enough to do that, because it would completely shut down the conspiracy. And that&#39;s just no fun.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s called confirmation bias. People WANT to believe a certain narrative, and thus they treat sources of information that align with their beliefs as &quot;more credible&quot; than any source that may conflict with what they want to believe as true. These aren&#39;t people who are making an honest attempt at finding objective truth regarding a situation/event...these are people who are already mostly certain about things in their own minds and are only seeking that which will reinforce it. Anyone who challenges them is almost certainly either a paid shill/disinfo agent or just a brainwashed sheep. In your case, since you are a relative of someone from Sandy Hook, you must be a paid shill/crisis actor who cannot be trusted in their minds.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>No one has ever done that. How do I know? Because anything can pierce through anything if the energy transfer is high enough.</p>

<p>The US navy&#39;s railgun uses aluminium projectiles. They can pierce through multiple layers of steel armour simply because they are accelerated to an extremely high velocity.</p>

<p>Force = Mass x Acceleration.</p>

<p>A small mass undergoing a high acceleration can have the same force as a large mass undergoing a lower acceleration.</p>

<p>If you run the numbers, an empty 757 traveling at 500mph hits with about the same force per square inch as a .50 caliber rifle bullet at point blank range.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not discounting that. At the very least, there were some things in the Podesta emails that were strange at first glance without context, but the real question is whether it was actually indicative of anything illegal/immoral. It certainly got much more play than it would have because people <em>wanted</em> it to be true for electoral politics reasons. </p>

<p>You get some of the same biases when anonymous people claim to know victims of various attacks: some want them to be true and some are convinced they&#39;re not. My calculus in evaluating them is the same. If a person makes a claim based on personal knowledge without staking that claim to their personal identity or otherwise providing evidence, I give it very little credence. Not saying it isn&#39;t true, just that I have no reason to believe it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Uncanny? I do not see that many claims. We have 446,800 subscribers and many more that visit without subscribing. Statistically speaking it would be more surprising if there were less people that knew someone.</p>

<p>In fact you can be sure that it would be used as evidence that no one knew anyone involved because they were paid actors.</p>

<p>That&#39;s how these people work. They can twist anything to conform to their theories. Someone says &quot;I know people&quot; he&#39;s clearly a paid shill. No one says &quot;I know people&quot;, its clearly because the people were actors.</p>

<p>That&#39;s the reality here. Anything can be twisted into &quot;evidence&quot; of any claim. You demand proof, I provide it, you call it fake and proof of your theory. I demand proof, you fail to provide it, I claim it is proof of my theory. And so it goes.</p>

<p>Globally and not just from the US, makes the probability rate of people from SH being on this sub (of all the places on the net in general) that much more unlikely.</p>

<p>Even more unlikely when you compare the demographics of those people against the typical person that joins (let alone browses, hi to the lurkers) Reddit.</p>

<p>My opinion is that most are talking themselves up to appear to have higher social standing in the sub on the topic in question (if not simply trolling), while in reality they are of lower social status and inflating their egos by impressing strangers on the Internet. Similar to how on FB people post highlight reels whereas the reality is most are in debt to the eyeballs and struggle to pay the bills.</p>

<p>Real victims of crime don&#39;t dwell on it as much online by comparison; looking instead to get on with life the best they can and very rarely try to claim victim status for social points (real rape victims don&#39;t make porn films about the rape, like a mattress wielding graduate for instance).</p>

<p>In short; after a cursory process of elimination I deem the possibility that there are genuine people related to victims of SH infinitely small.</p>

<p>This observation is regardless of any reservations for or against SH being a hoax or otherwise.</p>

<p>Totally good point. Still not sure about whether that first blast zone scene was staged or not. I read a very convincing explanation from a doctor as to why Jeff Bauman (aka Miracle Man) couldn not be at a Bruins game giving a big thumbs up less than three weeks after such a traumatic injury, and I tend to believe it. Plus Carlos and the ridiculous blood-soaked flag seems so contrived I would expect see Micheal Bay as the executive producer in the credits. </p>

<p>When someone claims they personally knew a victim, I give that no credence unless they provide evidence. I get why they may not want to — hell, I certainly wouldn&#39;t want to in most cases — but that doesn&#39;t mean they should be believed simply because they assert it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This posted on Reddit 3 months ago::</p>

<p>As followup to interest in the Sandy Hook FOIA post, here is some more info regarding Wolfgang Halbig&#39;s inquiries into Sandy Hook. </p>

<p>Halbig was leading the charge to file FOIA request for various school records pertaining to Sandy Hook Elementary School (SHES) such as maintenance and records for the school, receipts and contact for contractors performing work to the school, as well as police dash cam tapes and audio from the day. </p>

<p>If everything was indeed real, and the school was running, there should have been volumes of financial data, which is a matter of public record. However, many of Halbig&#39;s FOIA requests were denied. An appellate hearing was held and several witnesses involved with the school were examined.</p>

<p>A great excerpt of the school district&#39;s maintenance supervisor being examined. </p>

<p><a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=1cumfVWpVCc">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=1cumfVWpVCc</a></p>

<p>(Update to Halbig&#39;s inquiry: Halbig has shut his website &quot;sandyhookjusticereport.com&quot; down after receiving alleged threats to his family. He is interviewed about this on the Richie Allen Show 10/6/16)</p>

<p><a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Pe3sLE21eDo">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Pe3sLE21eDo</a></p>

<p>Still with me? </p>

<p>Here are some of Halbigs Original issues with the SHES &quot;massacre&quot; below. (Quoted from <a href="https://fellowshipoftheminds.com/2014/02/25/sandy-hook-massacre-was-a-contrived-event-says-former-state-trooper-wolfgang-halbig/">https://fellowshipoftheminds.com/2014/02/25/sandy-hook-massacre-was-a-contrived-event-says-former-state-trooper-wolfgang-halbig/</a>)</p>

<p>1.When the police arrived at Sandy Hook Elementary School (SHES) that morning, they parked ¼ mile from the school’s front door instead of doing what first responders are supposed to do in an active shooter event, which is to neutralize the threat as quickly as possible so as to save as many lives as possible.</p>

<p>2.Paramedics and EMTs (emergency medical technicians) were not allowed to enter the school. Instead they were kept waiting in the Sandy Hook fire station nearby, 500 yards down the road from SHES.</p>

<p>3.Trauma helicopters, which can provide the quickest and best medical services in an emergency, were not sent to Sandy Hook. Life Star, the medical helicopter service at Danbury Hospital’s Trauma Center, told Halbig “we were never called, never asked.”</p>

<p>4.Where were the ambulances to transport the wounded to hospitals?</p>

<p>5.Why did police declare 26 people to be dead within the first 11 minutes of the shooting, when according to Connecticut law, only a doctor can declare someone to be legally dead?</p>

<p>6.Why did the FBI classify the Sandy Hook massacre? This has never been done before. Even the Columbine School massacre was not classified information. To this day, the FBI report on Sandy Hook remains classified information, not releasable to the public.</p>

<p>7.Why did the State of Connecticut wait ELEVEN whole months to issue its official final report on the Sandy Hook shootings to the American public? Note that the final report does not include the FBI’s still-classified report.</p>

<p>8.Police transmissions don’t lie because they are made by sworn and trained law enforcement officers. On the morning of Dec. 14, 2012, recorded police transmissions said “We have multiple weapons inside the [SH] classroom — a rifle and a shotgun.” But nobody could find the shotgun in the school. Instead, a shotgun was found in the black Honda parked outside the school.</p>

<p>9.At 9:45 AM that day, a police officer found a surviving kindergarten-aged girl in the hallway. The officer sent her back into Room 8 — a crime scene with students and teachers shot dead. What police officer would do that?</p>

<p>10.Similarly, that morning, two Connecticut state troopers entered Room 10 and found an unharmed boy hiding in the bathroom. The troopers ordered the boy to stay in the room — a room with dead people. “That’s not police protocol.”</p>

<p>11.Having investigated and given expert testimony on many school shootings, Halbig says “I know what tears look like.” But the parents of slain Sandy Hook children, as we’ve noted here on FOTM, did not cry. (In the now famous case of Robbie Parker, the father of allegedly slain 6-year-old Emilie, he went from laughing and joking to pretending to choke back tears in the blink of an eye.)</p>

<p>12.Sandy Hook’s medical examiner Dr. Wayne Carver refused to let the parents see the bodies of their slain children, and instead gave them photos of the bodies, which is “unheard of.” Halbig knows about the inconsolable grief of parents and is himself a parent. Parents whose children had been shot dead “would kick the door down” demanding to see the bodies.</p>

<p>13.Why was Sandy Hook Elementary School torn down? This is not the case with any of the other schools where shootings had taken place, including Columbine School.</p>

<p>14.Who installed the new security system at SHES? This should be a matter of public record.</p>

<p>(This new security system was bragged about in a SHES news letter prior the incident)
1.The shooting-to-death of 26 people would leave 45-60 gallons of blood. Who cleaned it up? What biohazard company was hired to clean the crime scene?</p>

<p>(Receipts, records, chain of custody for biohazard cleanup?)</p>

<p>1.Why is there not even one lawsuit by a Sandy Hook parent against SHES for negligence? Halbig has never ever seen a school shooting without parents suing the school for negligence. </p>

<p>2.Why are there so many fund-raisers for the Sandy Hook shootings? Halbig: “I’ve never seen so many fund-raisers” in the case of Sandy Hook. One fundraising alone, by United Way, netted $17 million, from which “every [SH] parent got a big chunk of money.”</p>

<p>3.Alleged shooter Adam Lanza, 20, is said to have Asperger syndrome — a high-functioning (in academics) form of austism. Halbig points out, however, that like those with autism, children with Asperger have “very very poor motor skills” and “very poor muscle tone.” How did Asperger-afflicted Adam Lanza with “very poor muscle tone” carry a rifle, a shotgun, a handgun, and bullets? How did Asperger-afflicted Adam Lanza with “very very poor motor skills” shoot 26 people dead — not wounded — in less than five minutes, firing one bullet roughly every two seconds?</p>

<p>(An amateur shooter, with no formal training or experience, and adrenaline pumping, would not be able to shoot, lethally hit targets and reload quickly, while cycling between 3 different weapons. Below is a link of Keanu Reeves shooting for time in a &#39;3-gun trial&#39; while training with professionals for John Wick 2; essentially, this is how Lanza would have to be moving)</p>

<p>Globally and not just from the US, makes the probability rate of people from SH being on this sub (of all the places on the net in general) that much more unlikely.</p>

<p>Even more unlikely when you compare the demographics of those people against the typical person that joins (let alone browses, hi to the lurkers) Reddit.</p>

<p>My opinion is that most are talking themselves up to appear to have higher social standing in the sub on the topic in question (if not simply trolling), while in reality they are of lower social status and inflating their egos by impressing strangers on the Internet. Similar to how on FB people post highlight reels whereas the reality is most are in debt to the eyeballs and struggle to pay the bills.</p>

<p>Real victims of crime don&#39;t dwell on it as much online by comparison; looking instead to get on with life the best they can and very rarely try to claim victim status for social points (real rape victims don&#39;t make porn films about the rape, like a mattress wielding graduate for instance).</p>

<p>In short; after a cursory process of elimination I deem the possibility that there are genuine people related to victims of SH infinitely small.</p>

<p>This observation is regardless of any reservations for or against SH being a hoax or otherwise.</p>
