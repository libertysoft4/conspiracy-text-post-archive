        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>my initial thoughts (i sometimes read it but not that much) of scanning their websites / articles (appreciate diff columnists can have diff views):</p>

<p>1) they point the finger at Israel / Mossad etc (something that Breitbart / Infowars dont do)</p>

<p>2) they are critical of both Trump and Clinton</p>

<p>3) they do seem to flip flop on some things (e.g. their position on Flynn - but keep in mind that i dont religiously read them &amp; this is just my view after reading a few Flynn articles)</p>

<p>4) hits out at Alex Jones / Breitbard </p>

<p>5) hits out at &quot;fake news&quot; such as pizzagate &amp; email scandal (???)</p>

<p>6) does seem to have a positive view on Russia (claims sources etc...but then again with Russia standing up for Syria / NK / Iran vs Israel cant help but be pro Russia if youre anti Israel influence)</p>

<p>7) they see ISIS for the false flag creation that they are (from what i gather) </p>

<p>8) i haven&#39;t noticed anything glaring crazy on their site (gay frogs, flat earth, inter dimensional vampires)</p>

<p>if my above assumptions are correct why doesn&#39;t this website have a greater following in the conspiracy realm? </p>

<p>i understand it might be &quot;too real&quot; for Trump supporters (of which i used to be a passionate one but now sort of just hoping he keeps to his campaign promises of no world police etc) but otherwise it doesnt seem like a &quot;limited hangout&quot; etc type of place.</p>

<p>i dont think i see it at all here. </p>

<p>&quot;he is limited hangout. he talks about CIA surveillance sure, but then makes all of us seem crazy by talking about them putting chemicals in water that turns frogs gay&quot;</p>

<p>i think there def was some reporting by him of it and funnily enough i think later research has turned up that certain chemicals (estrogen etc) do alter behavior of frogs funnily enough. </p>

<p>in other parts of their website that ive been reading today they have no issue pointing the finger at Israel / Mossad.</p>

<p>are they going for the &quot;crazy method&quot; approach (e.g. holograms) which discredits the &quot;truthful&quot; element of who did it (mossad/cia etc)?</p>

<p>infact it was easier for me to google veteranstoday + 9/11 disinfo on google than talking to you / looking at their past articles to get to this:</p>

<p><a href="https://kendoc911.wordpress.com/911disinfo/911-disinfo-trolls/veterans-today-is-disinfo/">https://kendoc911.wordpress.com/911disinfo/911-disinfo-trolls/veterans-today-is-disinfo/</a></p>

<p>which seemingly says that they promote mini nukes &amp; holograms vs controlled demolition (ironically thats the &quot;disinfo&quot; i asked if they were spreading in my initial posts).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>question is, who do you trust more:</p>

<p>source a) which says 9/11 was controlled demolition...orchestrated by THE VATICAN &amp; JESUITS</p>

<p>or source b) which says that 9/11 was hologram planes &amp; mini nukes...orchestrated by Mossad.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They&#39;re closer to the truth than just about anyone else. Alex Jones is clearly controlled opposition, Noam Chomsky doesn&#39;t touch the topic, and anyone credible will point to Mossad taking care of the specifics and the neo cons maintaining plausible deniability throughout, with a cover up after the fact. That&#39;s my opinion though </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It depends which article/author you&#39;re talking about, but they generally say 9/11 was a false flag, controlled demolition, with Mossad involvement. Seems pretty legit.</p>

<p>They do sometimes call it a mini-nuclear attack, which in my opinion is disinfo. For example, the Khazarian mafia piece is very interesting, but it mentions the mini-nuke theory and that tends to make people skeptical of the entire piece.</p>

<p>There seems to be some evidence of nukes, the presence of certain isotopes and persistent heat from the wreckage. But in general I think the theory is disinfo. The question would be if they actually believe it, are knowingly spreading disinfo, or are spreading disinfo as cover (e.g. the lizard people so you seem crazy theory).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s gone off the rails on any number of issues and had a lot of infighting and accusations that became public between two of the people that originally managed it that laid it low and damaged it&#39;s credibility, as I recall. </p>

<p>The site get&#39;s referred to most often on other sites like &quot;Beforeitsnews&quot; that really is a mixed bag of both genuine stories and events along with a lot of really off the wall shit like end times prophesy, aliens, and near death experiences, etc. that are always to found on their roster along with them in no particular order or one that constantly shifts and shuffles them around. A time waster, when you have time to waste and see what&#39;s going on in the outermost fringes and gets more traffic than VT, I&#39;ll wager, that places it in the same category.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea, I was down with some of VT&#39;s stuff at first until I saw them pushing the whole &quot;nuke&quot; narrative. And then read a bunch of the guys split off and started veteran news network or someshit.
