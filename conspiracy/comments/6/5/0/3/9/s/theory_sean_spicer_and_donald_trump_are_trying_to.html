        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So, a while back Sean Spicer <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/sean-spicer-sends-distress-signal-to-america-with-upside-down-flag-pin_us_58c2f67ee4b054a0ea6a8502?hnz14dtlkgdd6ajor=&amp;">wore his American flag pin upside-down</a>, which is a sign of <a href="http://www.usaflagsupply.com/upside-down-flag/">distress</a>. </p>

<p>Then recently we have these slip ups where Spicer is shown blatantly saying they are trying to <a href="http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/328397-spicer-accidentally-says-trump-trying-to-destabilize-the-middle-east">destabilize Syria</a>. </p>

<p>Perhaps both of these were deliberate attempts to signal to America. Maybe Spicer and Trump know that things like war in Syria is a bad idea and these military actions are just to placate warmongers within the White House. Or perhaps they are asking for help, saying there&#39;s nothing they can do to stop TPTB and basically throwing an &quot;America, help!&quot; to all the viewers.</p>

<p>Idk, just a possibility. I&#39;m sure this has been said before, but I just wanted to throw it out there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a huge topic on its own though. It&#39;s not a topic I like to have a set opinion on, but there&#39;s certainly a reasonable argument to be made that the holocaust narrative is a highly fabricated one, particularly the aspect of it that pertains to the deliberate gassing of prisoners in chambers filled with Cyclon B. </p>

<p>And just to clarify, as it&#39;s such a contentious topic, I am not denying that thousands, probably hundreds of thousands, died in concentration camps. A tragedy of tremendous scale did occur without a doubt, but the main culprit seems to have been typhus and other diseases that have a tendency of flourishing in cramped, swampy and wet living conditions. And while Cyclon B was found in all concentration camps, it appears to only have been used on the inmates&#39; clothes and beddings, rather than as a chemical weapon (as its blue residue was only ever found in small disinfecting-chambers, and not in the large alleged gas chambers)</p>

<p>Through that lens (and again, I&#39;m not claiming to know anything for sure, just expressing my suspicions), were it true that the gassing narrative was invented after the fact and the numbers of deaths inflated, Spicer&#39;s remarks would actually be true, albeit provocative like nothing else. It would still be pretty wild for a US press secretary to hint at that publically, but at this point I wouldn&#39;t even be surprised if that was deliberate.</p>

<p>The point of that one isn&#39;t that it&#39;s always true, it&#39;s that it leads one to the most likely conclusion. Weird shit happens, which is why &quot;truth is stranger than fiction&quot; is also a common turn of phrase.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OP I agree with you. I think there&#39;s something to this. I&#39;ll say for about the 15th time here,  Trump will not attack Syria. (At least not a real attack) I believe its a great possibility that Trump is indeed working with Russia, hence Assad to end the REAL tyranny the is world is under. Maybe I&#39;m just optimistic but I follow this very very close. 
For some reason you&#39;re not being told the complete truth about the chemical bombing. 
Don&#39;t be discouraged OP you might be on the right track. It&#39;s a shills job to stop/derail things like you posted here. There will be others who will speak negative but that&#39;s just their ignorance. Stay safe, we need people like you! </p>

<p>Either he&#39;s just a stupid puppet who is there as a symbol and all the appointments had nothing to do with him, or he&#39;s really just a shitty president who&#39;s happy to bomb Syria even though he mocked Obama for years with saying how terrible bombing Syria was.
