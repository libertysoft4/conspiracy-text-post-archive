        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>There have already been thousands of retail stores that have closed due to Amazon.com. How are retail stores supposed to compete with low prices and shipping (usually free if you order enough) from an online store that has nearly everything? Day by day Amazon is increasing the variety of items it has in different departments and soon will probably be the only place to shop retail. Once enough retail stores have gone out of business, amazon will be able to increase their prices and do w/e they want.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>well hopefully with all that additional business they will be able, and do lower their prices or at least keep them steady :)     </p>

<p>I&#39;m gonna give them the benefit of the doubt and opportunity to do the right thing, because online shopping is much more efficient, enjoyable,  and a step in the right direction imo. And retail has been ripping off customers for as long as I can remember.      </p>

<p>And if prices do go up, and hope its only because their employees are treated better than a lot of them are in retail. And there could be other reasons for price increases besides greed. Really a lot to consider...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep it&#39;s not necessarily a bad thing, however that all depends on what Amazon decides to do. If they decide to raise their prices but treat their employees better then I&#39;ll support them. Unfortunately I dont think thats what is going to happen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yeah. Personally i like the idea of a one stop shop, and places like amazon make it relatively easy for producers of goods to get their goods to market, so hopefully the transition away from the traditional retail market will go smoothly.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They will start to become more predatory to merchants once they get more leverage over the market. I.e. banning merchants, giving their items the buy box over other merchants, hiding the link to see other buyers, putting their items at the top of search results etc... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well as i said in my edit of the previous comment, other chains have to get it together and start competing with amazon. There is no reason why amazon should have a monopoly on their business model. There is still time for other retailers/investors to give amazon a run for their money, which should curb the amount of shady practices being implemented.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can actually order something from amazon and get it within like 2 hours. And as the number of distribution centers grow, that number and the amount of items available for that fast of delivery will increase.     </p>

<p>I remember the Christmas before last, my sister had got my mom a blue ray disc, but my mom didn&#39;t have a blue ray player, so my sister ordered one on amazon, and it was there, on Christmas day, in a few hours. Ordered, shipped and delivered, on Christmas day, in a span of a few hours....that&#39;s a pretty convenient service that the masses will gobble up as it grows.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While I understand what <a href="/u/Longtimelurker859">/u/Longtimelurker859</a> is saying, amazon will be hard pressed to replace ALL retail. The biggest hurdle online retailers have is that case is still king. And while visa gift cards to exists, if you are running out to convert cash to a medium that can be used to purchase online you probably will just go some where to buy with cash. I live where I get 2 hours delivers with amazon, but mind you it&#39;s a limited inventory, so if you are looking for a specialty item you either will end up waiting for it to be delivered or go find it at a store around you. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>True. But people can&#39;t just manufacture a guitar. The industry is extremely conservative and traditionalist, and almost all companies refuse to mass manufacture beyond what they can do with wood, like CNC milling. People pay thousands of dollars for Gibsons manufactured with historical methods, for example.</p>

<p>The few companies that have tried making guitars of easier/quicker to manufacture guitars, like Switch Vibracell, have almost all completely failed. I don&#39;t foresee retail stores for musical instruments like guitars, drums, brass, or other string instruments failing any time soon, or at least until sufficiently advanced rapid manufacturing technology gets here. </p>

Read Amazon&#39;s financials and you&#39;ll quickly realize that their annual revenue growth doesn&#39;t come close to accounting for the revenue losses experienced by the brick/mortar retailers. Wall Street doesn&#39;t want you to realize that the store closures and bankruptcies are due to the significant spending cuts by the American consumer. God forbid that  Main Street actually get out in front of a market crash and not have their 401(k)s incinerated. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well as i said in my edit of the previous comment, other chains have to get it together and start competing with amazon. There is no reason why amazon should have a monopoly on their business model. There is still time for other retailers/investors to give amazon a run for their money, which should curb the amount of shady practices being implemented.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Walmart also has free store to store shipping now, so if your local shitty Walmart doesn&#39;t have what you need/want, chances are the exotic shitty Walmart 20 miles from where you live has it.</p>

<p>I thought Amazon originally had the $35 free shipping and they upped it to $50? I could be wrong. </p>

<p>And I think Walmart will get in on the drone delivery deal as well...</p>
