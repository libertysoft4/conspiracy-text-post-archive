    <div class="md"><p><em>Now I will tell you the answer to my question. It is this. The Party seeks power entirely for its own sake. We are not interested in the good of others; we are interested solely in power. Not wealth or luxury or long life or happiness; only power, pure power. What pure power means you will understand presently. We are different from all the oligarchies of the past in that we know what we are doing. All the others, even those who resembled ourselves, were cowards and hypocrites. The German Nazis and the Russian Communists came very close to us in their methods, but they never had the courage to recognize their own motives. They pretended, perhaps they even believed, that they had seized power unwillingly and for a limited time, and that just round the corner there lay a paradise where human beings would be free and equal. We are not like that.</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Back to the topic, there are certain things that are can never be under national control. And those are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Offensive Military (defensive and offensive are totally separate).</p></li>
<li><p>Espionage Organizations (by their nature, they are intended to subvert the elective process)</p></li>
<li><p>World Economics (Economics is a series of agreements between nations)</p></li>
<li><p>Pharmaceuticals and Health (One nation can not tolerate another possessing ownership over life and death)</p></li>
<li><p>Multinational Corporations (A nation can not own a corporation that is inherently stateless)</p></li>
<li><p>Religious Institutions (the primary concept of religion is that it supersedes all outside allegiance)</p></li>
<li><p>Patents and Technology (one nation can not bare to suffer knowing of a better solution, by enforcing another nations patents)</p></li>
<li><p>Forms of Political Unity (one nation can not separate and excel without causing unrest with its primitive neighbors)</p></li>
<li><p>News (one nation can not allow indecent information to reach it&#39;s populace, which it is attempting to censor)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>There is essentially one exception to this, and that is Switzerland. They operate under a completely unique, and vastly superior government, with enormously higher standards of living, without inciting unrest with it&#39;s neighbors. Likewise, they contribute nothing to the world military, while setting the standards for world economics, pharmacuetical patents, espionage, news, corporate secrecy, and are the guardians of the Vatican.</p>

<p>All the same, offensive military is just a population tax. True conquest is done through improving organization, bettering the minds, and bettering the living conditions. The military stick is only there to &#39;genocide&#39; conceptions of rebellion. The nations that are least able to defend themselves pay the cost of the military, but the bomb, tank, and weapons dealers are international in nature. No one nation would allow another to become the sole possessor of nuclear power, not for long, and never will a Tank win the hearts and minds of a people, or turn them into profitable subjects.</p>

<p>I won&#39;t go too far off on a tangent here, but just realize no one nation would EVER, be allowed the sole right to assassinate, sabotage, or bomb a nation. If you suspect &#39;cave dwelling Muslims&#39; are even the smallest bit of the problem, imagine what an organization as powerful as the EU could do to the US, if assassination and sabotage was permitted internationally on an ad hoc basis?</p>

<p>No, no. All these issues are decided internationally, along with deciding which nations will pay for them, and how much. Does the US not agree with contributing $4 Trillion toward a international bombing campaign against the Iraqis? How about we kill all your bankers, steal the banking industry, and blow up a couple towers... would you pay then, or like another reminder or your true role in the world of politics?</p>

<p>How about we kill your President? Would you pay our tax then?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It has been a long time since I read the document entitled, &quot;A World Effectively Controlled By The United Nations,&quot; but to my mempry, it seems that the UN was needed until such a time as it can be reformed and radically redesigned, resulting in the appearance of something more or less, a global tyranny.</p>

<p>What we are witnessing now, is the way in which countries will increase their own power by uniting their people against external threats. What&#39;s different is that, while people certainly ARE becoming Nationalistic, the enemy riled against is the same for everyone- Terrorism.</p>

<p>So the world seems to be drifting apart, but each part is heading in the same direction. I foresee another Great War, looming on the horizon. What form the world takes after the fact, is not immediately obvious.</p>

<p>On the other hand, as Lincoln P Bloomfield suggested in 1961, a war or brink of war,-like scenario could be envisioned, to push reforms that would tighten control over time. Disarmament comes in three phases. We are in the second phase. I believe a fear of a global war will push people to accept the third phase of disarmament, and if that happens, the people behind the EU will have won.</p>

<p>In a world controlled by a central authority, nations will be able to retain their own identity. They won&#39;t be any less slaves.</p>

<p>The UN wants to chip the entire planet with biometric computer chips. Somehow I doubt they would just let everyone go now that they have them right where they want them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No power vs. Little power are two different things, especially when the UN Charter can and has been radically redesigned, to apportion more power.</p>

<p>The UN is 75 percent funded by the USA and it&#39;s constitution was penned by 13 US Senators in San Francisco in 1963. It seems fair to presume that the UN is just an extention of the will of the United States, which itself is an extention of the will of European elites who run the EU.</p>

<p>So there is a lot of power there, if you aren&#39;t willing to ignore the rest of the picture.</p>

<p>My main point is that A) It&#39;s power may make a quantum leap soon, or</p>

<p>B) The USA may do away with the UN as it is no longer useful as a means t the end which is global domination.</p>

<p>How is this nonsense?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It seems to me that the UN is more key than you think. It may be this or that, but one thing it is not, is irrelevant.</p>

<p>It&#39;s vision is the reason for the world going the direction it goes. Incrementally implimenting the UN&#39;s policies, is well underway, and led to developments such as the African Union, which started out with 75000 troops trained over ten years prior, by none other than the USA. Coincidence?</p>

<p>The powers behind the UN are very relevant, and their ambition is clear- global domination.</p>

<p>They have resources to make this happen, and are well into the progress of their plans.</p>

<p>What makes you think they are A)only Anglo, and B)Losing power?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>they are only anglo. the entire EU disaster and UN disaster were design by the Wilsonian Idealist morons in the US and UK. as is the whole IMF disaster and all the financial capitalist bullshit.</p>

<p>they funded nazism to create the EU etc...</p>

<p>the UN right now as it exists is just a way for them to shame China and Russia on the world stage seemingly. it&#39;s not really working though.</p>

<p>there have been many articles written on the death of US military and political dominance and hegemony. the whole &quot;american century&quot; bullshit thing was just propaganda written by cheney among others.</p>

<p>the dominance of russia and china in the future was even spoken about by US intelligence analysts in the 60s by the way.</p>

<p>it is due to their geographical advantage in Asia, the most plentiful source of untapped resources on the planet</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that the last century is behind us, and a new century, with new potential lay ahead. China is certainly becoming a big deal. Russia too, but they could both be history depending on how the tides turn. America hasn&#39;t really lost military hegemony. In fact, they have made astounsing gains and anticipate (it seems), making further gains. We will really just have to wait and see.</p>

<p>I&#39;m still unclear why you think everyone behind the EU is Anglo. Can you name some names?</p>

<p>It seems to me that anyone from that area, by now would be Anglo-Saxon, if not a mix with other types. I have a hard time believing anyone on earth is only Anglo.</p>

<p>I myself am from a Frisian family that stretches back over a thousand years at least, but I am 6 other things also, including Ukrainian, French (pff), and possibly Israelite (it&#39;s a rumour; a rumour I started).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Haha you have missed my point entirely! My point is that, at some point in history, the Anglo and the Saxon tribes mixed so much, that people began to call them Anglo-Saxons. This is actually, extremely relevant.</p>

<p>There is no such thing anymore, as an Anglo person.</p>

<p>Now obviously this is splitting hairs, but it is so funny how you are defending this point to the death, even though you don&#39;t have to.</p>

<p>I just want you to call them Anglo-Saxons. Is that so terrible?</p>

<p>Wilsonian Idealism is an interesting topic, sure, but how will looking it up help me? Why can&#39;t you just write a couple more sentances expoinding upon your point? Why do you just say two words and then run away? Like I said, if you don&#39;t have the time just say so, but I would prefer to have an actual conversation, rather than to have some rude person tell me what I do and don&#39;t know.</p>

<p>Seeing as you are the kind of person to make snap judgements, based on logical fallacies, I feel as if you are almost entirely a waste of time to talk to.</p>

<p>I did some reading about Wilsonian Idealism yesterday, and I already admitted that i find it interesting, so how can you go ahead and say what you just said? It seems as if you are actively trying your hardest, to not have a conversation.</p>

<p>I warn you now, if you say just one more thing about who I am, and call me names or say something bad about me, I will report you for it. I am not against wading through the IRE, to find interesting things, but you&#39;re not seeming to be offering anymore. Just non-stop spewing of toxic hate. Why do you hate so much? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>But you are twisting my words. I didn&#39;t mean to say that anglo culture doesn&#39;t exist. I pointed out that the Wiki cites Anglo culture to be either Anglo-American or aome part of the Eastern UK. So if you use the word, at least use it properly and not as a general term for all white people.</p>

<p>I meant that Anglo is an old word, and modern times doesn&#39;t see a lot of Anglo-only culture.</p>

<p>Even just reading the wiki, makes it clear that Wilson would be considered an Anglo-American, which is not the same as calling him Anglo.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>for most of us in this sub the obviousness of this quote makes the attribution quite unnecessary. this specific quote is arguably the most conspiracy relevant comedian quote of all time outside of the equally obvious George Carlin material. </p>

<p>inserting a <strong>painfully</strong> obvious quote into the rare situation where if fits perfectly into an unrelated comment thread is a kind of inside joke on reddit.... using a Bill Hicks quote (<strong>especially that one</strong>) in this sub is obviously a joke to anyone who has spent any time around conspiracy material, or comedy, or music, or popular culture ffs. can you understand how attribution kind of ruins the inside joke? anyone who is unseasoned enough to have not yet encountered the original bill hick&#39;s routine (or the hundreds of times it has been sampled into songs, memes, etc) will get in on the joke when they eventually do.</p>

<p>Compared to Hillary, he&#39;s a fucking genius of a saint.</p>

<p>But yeah, it doesn&#39;t matter what the electorate does. Americans do not control their govt and their govt does not control their military resources.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I truly think this is just a ratings grab. Trumps been seen as insensitive and conscious-less. The narrative is that Assad murdered innocent children with gas. If he goes on the offensive to protect innocent children, he&#39;s seen as having a conscious by the left which will certainly boost his record low ratings. At the same time, he&#39;s rallying up the right by doing what he said and &quot;going after ISIS.&quot; Now he&#39;s trying to have us all rally around the flag in order to boost his ratings to try and secure a second term. He had nothing to lose in fear of impeachment. </p>
