        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Some of you might have seen my <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/63pib8/alex_joness_threat_to_a_congressman_may_be_a/dfw3y6b/">recent post</a> about Donald Trump and Alex Jones being deeply involved with the cult of scientology or that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/64efor/why_did_obama_back_down/dg1ie0e/">suppressed history</a> getting out is considered an existential threat to the old world order.</p>

<p>Shortly thereafter, the relationship between Elon Musk and Amber Heard received a lot of attention.  That&#39;s relevant to the above posts for a number of reasons.  One, Amber Heard is a scientologist as well.</p>

<p>Not widely known but also significant is that scientology <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/01/scientology-alien-space-cathedral_n_2388833.html">has built</a> landing strips and rocket pads in the New Mexico desert complete with a cathedral to aliens.  They claim we were seeded on Earth by aliens from Planet Xenu.</p>

<p>Today, it was <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/donald-trump-mars-nasa-international-space-station-red-planet-livestream-three-years-a7699686.html">announced</a> that Trump wants to accelerate a &#39;mission to Mars&#39; to within the next 4 years.  Obviously that implies an awful lot of rocket launches to build the Mars spaceship in orbit in preparation for such a journey.</p>

<p>Of course that is not their true intention.  The preprogramming went into high gear over the weekend, with notorious CIA disinformation agent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vXf6tYSi6k&amp;t=17m30s">Alex Jones</a> claiming that we are seeded by aliens from another planet.  With a pretext in hand to put a lot of rockets into near Earth orbit, the stage is set to assemble the required equipment to stage a fake alien invasion / landing, perhaps under the pretense of &quot;greeting&quot; us because we have matured to an interplanetary species or as a hostile force.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is no NWO. The NWO is what the Old World Order is trying to avoid. They are desperately trying to hold on to the power that they had for the past millenium. The NWO is a psy-op to think there is a grand scheme they are putting together when in fact, they are acting on plans they have been working on for hundreds of years. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right. I don&#39;t think AntiFa is the kind of change we need.</p>

<p>That said, I don&#39;t believe that the &#39;OWO&#39; would need a fake alien invasion to take control of the population. What makes me skeptical is that you guys pushing this theory seem to suggest that the (((elite))) are looking for a unbelievably complex solution. But based on the attitude and activities of our recent leadership and information suggested by sources like FBI anon, given that info is true, the elite seem to have been quite sloppy and disorganized about keeping their act under wraps. Personally, I think there are widespread management issues among the (((elite))) and something like a fake second coming of Jesus would require 110% precision and coordination.</p>

<p>That said, it isn&#39;t likely that the population is going to buy the alien story no matter what they do, and conflict seems inevitable. The people already suspect the government, why bother with trying to cover it up?</p>

<p>Also, what makes you think changing the current system will fix our issues? The problem lies not with the system but with the people running it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a beauty.... not only was Amber Heard raised catholic (in Texas) she became an atheist when her friend died at 16.</p>

<p>She considers herself bisexual and has dated many women. </p>

<p>If you are grasping at straws here to make a John Depp connection and his participation with Scientology let me remind you that he went on record with Vanity Fair in 2011 saying that he went to a couple of meeting because they paid him &quot;stupid amounts of money&quot; and he didn&#39;t believe it. </p>

<p>That was a year before they started to date and lead times with magazine like vanity fair can take up to 6 months to a year to plan an interview. It&#39;s likely that these meeting took place years before she was in the picture.</p>

<p>She is being blasted as a money grubbing whore so if she was indeed a scientologist wouldn&#39;t she be very public about this to get the &quot;stupid amount of money&quot; paid to celebs to participate? </p>

<p>Also, it&#39;s insulting that you think that Elon Musk would even slip his peen in a Scientologists vagina even if it was a one night stand - let alone date her and let her be around his kids. </p>

<p>The whole OP is now rubbish. You really could have just let that off your post and <em>maybe</em> someone would have believed this bullshit.</p>

<p>This will sell beautifully. KibBitzLaw tweeted:</p>

<p>&quot;Does life imitate art or does art imitate life? It&#39;s the latter. The evidence is overwhelming for Draco - human sacrifice connection</p>

<p>Honestly, the only way Podesta could be forgiven for all he&#39;s done is if he SOMEHOW forgave himself, admitted everything, and explained&quot;why&quot;</p>

<p>Presume I am correct about Draco-human sacrifice connection and then let&#39;s say Podesta is a patsy who got tied up in this years ago.</p>

<p>Could any of us honestly say we wouldn&#39;t have done the same in his shoes? If all of it is true, the man has seen things you&#39;d never wish on even your worst enemy. I mean honestly, we see this as the ONLY way Podesta&#39;s involvement in Pedogate can be somewhat understood. So with that said: John, we&#39;re ready when you are. If you want to make things right and fess up, we can ensure your safety.&quot;</p>
