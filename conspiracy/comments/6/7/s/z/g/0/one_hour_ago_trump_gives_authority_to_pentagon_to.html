        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>President Trump has delegated to the Pentagon the authority to set the American military troop levels in Iraq and Syria. The move restores a process that was in place prior to the Bush and Obama administrations and is another sign of how the White House is giving military commanders greater flexibility in their operations.</p>

<p>&quot;The President has delegated the authority for Force Management Levels (FML) for Iraq and Syria to the Secretary,&quot; said Captain Jeff Davis, a Pentagon spokesman, referring to Defense Secretary Jim Mattis.</p>

<p>On March 30, the Pentagon made this announcement:</p>

<p>In order to maintain tactical surprise, ensure operational security and force protection, the coalition will not routinely announce or confirm information about the capabilities, force numbers, locations, or movement of forces in or out of Iraq and Syria,” said Eric Pahon, a Pentagon spokesman.</p>

<p>On April 13, McMaster was saying he wanted 50,000 troops in Syria.</p>

<p>Please see my post on France&#39;s declaration of proof today that the chemical attack was conducted by Assad.</p>

<p>With reports of Israel conducting airstrike on Damascus airport it could be important</p>

<p>Edit: Forgot to point out that Turkey conducted airstrikes on Kurdish forces in Syria and Iraq yesterday. If you&#39;re not aware of it, the US just announced approval of a 300 million dollar arms sale to the Kurdish rebels.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My theory is probably not true, but I was wondering if this whole warmongering thing was a necessary part of some kind of deal. </p>

<p>Could the military and military intelligence agencies (possible military industrial complex as a whole) be working in tandem to take down one part of the deep state, pizzagate, but at the same time requesting that Trump beat the war drums to keep business going. I am thinking that there must be some patriotic or at least sensible people in the military don&#39;t want their whole country getting fucked while their buddies get fucked from war and not taken care of afterwards.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The man literally promised to &quot;bomb the shit&quot; out of his enemies and said he is the most militaristic guy you&#39;ve ever seen. He was clearly a warmonger during the campaign but no one chose to listen - and his actions show this. He goes straight for confrontational escalation rather than flexing soft power (sanctions, blockades, other economic measures). </p>

<p>Trump does what suits his ego, he saw how the media loved his little pseudo airstrike in Syria so my belief is he will want to be a &quot;war time president&quot; like Dubyah and wear his military jackets and hats with &quot;mission accomplished&quot; banners behind him for the boost to his ratings. War sells, it saved Bush and sunk Obama for pulling out. </p>
