    <div class="md"><p>Yeah sorry, I misread your post and edited mine when I realized that I was basically  saying the exact same thing as you.</p>

<p>Sentience is an ideal standard, but it&#39;s impossible to measure. The real question is when does a fetus become a human but that&#39;s nearly impossible to tell because there is really no clear line you can draw. But I&#39;m sure most people don&#39;t think an egg or sperm counts as a human. A few people more might argue that first trimester counts as a human. And nearly everyone will agree that late into the third trimester it&#39;s basically a human. It&#39;s an incredibly complex topic because there really is no line in the sand you can draw.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If we use the same medical standards as we do to determine if someone is &quot;braindead&quot; and therefore should be removed from life support, we would measure brain waves. Fetuses develop brain waves at approximately 8-9 weeks gestation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s not what I&#39;m saying. I&#39;m saying if your argument against aborting a fetus is because it&#39;s alive, you must also agree that eating plants and animals is wrong because they are alive. The attribute of life isn&#39;t special to humans, so that can&#39;t be the defining factor of why it&#39;s wrong to kill a human and not an animal.</p>

<p>And if you&#39;re only talking about killing human life (even though that&#39;s a terrible argument), then it&#39;s also wrong to have doctors draw blood or have surgery of any kind. You can&#39;t smoke or drink because those also kill human cells, which are alive. </p>

<p>What makes a human life special is not the fact that it&#39;s alive, but rather it&#39;s consciousness. But when does consciousness begin? That is the real question, not when does life begin.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Only in cases where that person is still sentient. If you can still detect regular brain activity, it could be argued that it is murder. There have been people that have been totally comatose but still were aware about what was going on around them. Which is why answering questions like &quot;is it ok to pull the plug&quot; become so tricky. If their brain activity has totally ceased, though, it&#39;s not really murder because they are already dead.</p>

<p>But then that gets into the discussion that is any type of murder justifiable. Is assisting in killing someone who is living with an incredibly poor health conditions justifiable? If someone is going to die, or is so impaired that they cannot live a happy life at all, is killing them a mercy?</p>

<p>&gt; Still think first trimester fetus is alive or even &quot;a baby&quot;</p>

<p>&gt; Doesn&#39;t understand that the death penalty is highly unethical and painful</p>

<p>&gt; Doesn&#39;t understand the death penalty directly conflicts with the Hippocratic Oath</p>

<p>&gt; Doesn&#39;t understand that innocent people are killed under the death penalty</p>

<p>&gt; Doesn&#39;t understand that for the Death penalty is ok, you first must admit murder is ok</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah that&#39;s yet another issue with it.</p>

<p>Hundreds of people have been released from death row after being found innocent. How many people weren&#39;t found  innocent before being executed? To be ok with the death penalty, you have to be ok with a few hundred innocent people being killed needlessly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I was for it when I was a teenager. In my young head I figured if you you got charged with murder you did it. OJ got away with it, it must be hard to prove. Then over the years I started seeing people released due to DNA and general police fuckery and did a full 180. In general I&#39;d rather 100 criminals go free than punish one innocent person. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>well, don&#39;t get upset with them when they tune you out after that ... because you&#39;re confusing the issue from their point of view.</p>

<p>The reason that the death penalty costs so much is simply because of the difficulty in executing the statement -- legal fees, basically.  IF the System were to condone murder and just simply execute the sentence ... it would be much cheaper.  Couple days after sentencing in a jail, few hundred/thousand dollars worth of equipment/drugs ... and done.</p>

<p>So, from your conservative nemsis&#39; point of view, if it weren&#39;t for these damn meddling kids making the sentencing harder ... it would be quick, cheap way of murdering people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t listen to the haters, you&#39;re right that society has become decadent and corrupt. A fetus is an unborn baby contrary to what the pro-murder crowd is screeching and the fact that they justify &quot;choice&quot; for killing the child when they are allowed to be born and live is disgusting and hypocritical. Don&#39;t fall prey to mainstream culture and the lies it spreads. God bless and best of luck to you in all endeavors.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree OP.
Sucks to see all these liberals in here.  Abortion should only be allowed in cases of the woman being impregnated against their will.  It is the woman&#39;s responsibility to control the flow of semen to her eggs.  I am okay with the morning after pill but not if it gets to where everyone takes it after having sex every time. </p>

<p>I am for the death penalty, but it needs to be done as soon as they are 100% proven guilty.  Need something better than lethal injection though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah sorry, I misread your post and edited mine when I realized that I was basically  saying the exact same thing as you.</p>

<p>Sentience is an ideal standard, but it&#39;s impossible to measure. The real question is when does a fetus become a human but that&#39;s nearly impossible to tell because there is really no clear line you can draw. But I&#39;m sure most people don&#39;t think an egg or sperm counts as a human. A few people more might argue that first trimester counts as a human. And nearly everyone will agree that late into the third trimester it&#39;s basically a human. It&#39;s an incredibly complex topic because there really is no line in the sand you can draw.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Obviously, the context is that of human life. You&#39;re getting lost in semantics. The question is, at what point during the process of embryo to human do you become an entity with rights. There is nothing currently known to test when that moments occurs, yet that is the problem that OP supposedly has solved. We agree. I assure you. </p>
