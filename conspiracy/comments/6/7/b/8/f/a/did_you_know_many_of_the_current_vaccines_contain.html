<p>First, just read the current schedule&#39;s ingredients list: </p>

<p>There are many red flags but let&#39;s just focus on MRC-5 for a moment.
MRC-5 (Medical Research Council cell strain 5) is a diploid human cell culture line composed of fibroblasts derived from lung tissue of an 14 week old aborted caucasian male fetus. The cell line was isolated by J.P. Jacobs and colleagues in September 1966.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MRC-5">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MRC-5</a></p>

<p>So let me get this straight... forcing someone to inject their child and themselves with aborted fetus tissue is somehow ethical?</p>

<p>How is keeping this information hidden using medical brand naming ethical? Does this not violate the idea of informed consent?</p>

<p>Many so-called liberals are demanding GMO labelling, ingredient labelling, stricter quality controls on our water and air, but they just look past MRC-5 without even looking into what it is. This makes no sense whatsoever.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lazy response. A quick Google search can confirm.</p>

<p>&quot;Varicella (chickenpox), rubella, hepatitis A, shingles and one preparation of rabies vaccine are all made by growing the viruses in fetal embryo fibroblast cells. Fibroblast cells are the cells needed to hold skin and other connective tissue together. The fetal embryo fibroblast cells used to grow vaccine viruses were first obtained from elective termination of two pregnancies in the early 1960s.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Basically there is no other way to grow the attenuated viruses used in vaccines than growing them in human cell lines.  And the cell line chosen is based on its ability to replicate the viruses in an efficient manner. Viruses are then purified extensively and tested for contamination before being used in vaccines. So in my mind, this is a non-issue.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The MMR and Chickenpox vaccine contain products derived from human albumin. This raises concerns about a risk of prion disease transmission, as prions are too small to be filtered out by any current purification step, nor can they be killed by any known heat treatment for sterilization, nor is there any known test for it. </p>

<p>-&quot;However, the use of pHSA carries the risk of transmission of virus and emerging infectious pathogens, such as prions, from blood for which no tests are available. In addition, existing heat treatments for blood and blood products are ineffective for prions and possibly unidentified infectious agents. &quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It doesn&#39;t matter the amount. It is in direct violation of many ethical principles some people (like myself) hold. The fact they try and hide it only makes it less trustworthy. The fact that you and others marginalise this principle should make everyone question rights, laws, and ethics in the first place. </p>

<p>Vaccine theory and efficacy are a different issue than vaccine safety. And to assume immunisation is only achievable through vaccination is also a common fallacy.</p>

<p>Aluminum is essential for the vaccine activity because it is what is known as an adjuvant. Without it the vaccine just won&#39;t work. If you have ethical or personal reasons not to vaccinate, that&#39;s ok. Just don&#39;t do it yourself. But overall vaccines are one of the best medicines we have. In fact they&#39;re so effective and useful that drug companies didn&#39;t want to fund <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/02/vaccines-are-profitable-so-what/385214/">them</a>.

The amount of aluminium found in ONE dose of Hep-B (given to most infants in US in the first 12 hours of life) exceeds even the EPA&#39;s drinking water standards.

    <div class="md"><p>Everyone is entitled to their opinion. I happen to believe vaccination is worth it. The aluminum in the vaccines is in a form that does not easily enter the circulation. So it does not move around the body much, but stays put where the vaccine was injected. That limits any potential toxicity. And the vaccines are tested both before use and then side effects are extensively studied after they go into clinical use. I realize I am in the minority opinion here, but I am not a shill. I don&#39;t work for drug companies, this is just my personal opinion. I read r/conspiracy because I do believe some conspiracies are real. But, in my mind, I just don&#39;t think this is a problem.

I believe in your right to chose vaccination for you and our kids, but now they have started rolling out mandatory vaccines for everyone. It starts in CA as SB277 and next it will be adults. No exemptions. Right now 69 shots from 0-18. There are 140 new vaccines in the pipeline. </p>

<p>Not long ago I probably would have agreed with you on vaccines, I was told they were good. However the last few years really have shifted me as I have researched this topic. Once you dig into it, it becomes obvious that this topic is very one sided in the media, and the establishment medical and science communities. Once you start to uncover the inconvenient realities you start to wonder. Are vaccines actually hurting more than they help?</p>

<p>Autism and chronic illness rates are skyrocketing. No one has an explanation. Is there a chance vaccines and/or vaccine additives are a contributing factor? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are we not entitled to religious freedom in the modern world. So you can deny one person&#39;s right (in this case religious freedom) for another person&#39;s belief (blind faith in big pharma)? So what good are rights then at all? 
This is a typical collectivist trap: you have rights as long as you believe what WE do. </p>

<p>Eventually this completely eliminates the rights of the  individual in the end. See, this process of eroding our rights has been well underway for a hundred years, and you people just keep screaming about new reasons to take away individual liberties. </p>

<p>Can you not see the police state unfolding before your very eyes?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You will find ethical aspects of her story are more repulsive, than these cell-lines, because it&#39;s a story of medical knowledge that includes deep aspects of pre civil-rights racism, sexism and questionable ethics in a bygone era of medicine, that we all have already benefited from. I think that the Radiolab podcast may have done a show on her. It is more disturbing, I sincerely believe, because she was a sentient, realised human, and not a potential human. And I know this is the knife edge of what so deeply divides us on that issue. If you are repulsed by that argument, regarding the vaccines that still use the cell lines that originate with fetus tissue, then it is the physical, reproductive link that ties that tissue to its origin that repulses you, like a limb that has been amputated and obscenely kept alive, separated from its spirit. I understand that, I feel it when I think of the physical link to my own ancestry. Here is the crux of an unavoidable future: the information that makes up a cell can now be read and copied into a digital format, stored on a hard drive for X time, soon, it can be read and printed. Separated from the source, finally, physically and spiritually severed.  Would that change your thoughts? Sincerely : BingoRage</p>
