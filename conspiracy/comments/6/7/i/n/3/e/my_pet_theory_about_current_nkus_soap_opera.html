        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>We <a href="http://thediplomat.com/2017/04/the-us-didnt-send-that-carrier-group-to-the-korean-peninsula-but-did-north-korea-know-that/">now know</a> that the USS Carl Vinson was in fact <em>not</em> dispatched to the North Korean peninsula as a show of strength and defiance to Jong Un. Why was this false narrative pushed by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdD6dz-e2S8">mainstream media</a>, and by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ccHY0fcWTQ">Trump himself</a>? You also have Chinese troops amassing at NK border right after Xi meets with Trump in Mar-a-Lago. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s what I think; If we would all direct our short-term memories to 1-2 weeks ago, what was the media drilling us with? Chemical attacks by Assad and Trump&#39;s subsequent response. You know exactly when the North Korea coverage ramped up and began being shoved down our throats? Right when <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OwObMIIkvo">this interview</a> of Assad was released, where he very cogently explains that a chemical attack by his regime in the current climate would be the dumbest possible decision to make, stating legitimate reasons why he would have had to be suicidal to do such a thing. You also had <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0cNuPd2CDk">Ron Paul</a> and an <a href="https://www.rt.com/usa/384520-postol-report-sarin-syria/">MIT professor</a> also coming out to say it makes zero sense for Assad to do it, and it makes 100% sense for a rebel group to carry this out in order to achieve desired results. </p>

<p>My theory: People were starting to scratch their heads about who really carried out the chemical attacks, and the media needed another blitz to shake the etch-a-sketch. The drama between US and NK is a manufactured distraction. If nothing comes of it, I&#39;d say it&#39;s pretty safe to assume, as the media is making it look like a full scale conventional or nuclear war is imminent. </p>

<p>No he&#39;s not. </p>

<p>The article linked about the missing carrier decries the false rhetoric by Trump as a dumb move. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not a dumb move, it&#39;s a show of strength. NK was scared, so they backed down.</p>

<p>I&#39;d say they were always waking up. They just lived in the country. If you watch old movies, you&#39;ll never see a straight-up hero, always the anti-hero. </p>

<p>Humphrey Bogart also came up around that time (they were both from New York). </p>

<p>Their films carried until the mid 50s, and then there was the Twilight Zone which was a massive red pill series (because every episode opens on characters who do not fit in their surrounding, and try to wake everyone up to the insanity of the world they live in). </p>

<p>Multiple things can occur simultaneously, and most people do not have one-track minds.</p>

<p>The DPRK have conducted a series of missile tests since February so this has been an ongoing story that predates the chemical attack of 4th April.</p>

<p>What else happened on April 4th? Another missile test. And on the 15th? A massive military parade that showed off what appeared to be new ballistic missiles and ICBMs. 16th? Another missile test.</p>

<p>There is also evidence to suggest that they&#39;re planning further nuclear tests.</p>

<p>Not to mention the threat to sink the Carl Vinson, strike Australia with nuclear weapons, threaten China with &quot;catastrophic consequences&quot; and more.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bill Maher was making fun of Trump for losing a fleet. This is retarded. We&#39;ve become so accustomed to holding Presidents accountable for what they say publicly, or at least obsessed with fact checking it as if that&#39;s all that matters.</p>

<p>A simple explanation is that Trump is loose with the truth and will probably tell a lie to strengthen his negotiating position. So it turns out the fleet was going south with some Japanese ships to run some military drills.</p>

<p>But now it appears the fleet is going back north and something big with NK is looming... who knows maybe more posturing.</p>

<p>If anything it should tell us to never take anything Trump says at face value.</p>

<p>I&#39;d say they were always waking up. They just lived in the country. If you watch old movies, you&#39;ll never see a straight-up hero, always the anti-hero. </p>

<p>Gangsters railing against the big banks, con-artists decrying their position in life from crooked judges, etc. </p>

<p>Those film genres were huge in the 30s to 70s. </p>
