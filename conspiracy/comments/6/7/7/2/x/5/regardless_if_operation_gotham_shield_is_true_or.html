<p>IT CAN. If enough people are wise to a plot, TPTB have no choice but to pull the plug. Otherwise they leave a trail of evidence behind that was found even before they pulled the trigger, which makes it twice as damning as finding the same evidence after the fact. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Throwing some copypasta from a thread I made about this as well OP. Hope the info provided helps. </p>

<p>The first EAS message in Sept 2016 said &quot;would you, could you, on a train?&quot;. The next morning there was a train crash in NY. </p>

<p>Shortly before (or after), the EAS saying &quot;Trump April 26&quot; was played. Keep in mind, Trump wasn&#39;t even elected yet when that EAS message was captured. </p>

<p>NY EAS said they were hacked. I don&#39;t buy it. Also worth noting; the train wreck was in Hoboken. Operation Gotham Shield is centered near Hoboken. </p>

<p>Now, why that pertains to this post; on April 26th, there is a huge drill/training exercise going on in NYC, it is simulating a 10kt nuclear blast over the city. Why is that relevent? Because on the morning of 9/11, there was a massive drill/training exercise going on which (you guessed it); simulated commercial aircraft being hijacked and weaponized. The day of the Boston bombing there was a drill simulating a bombing with a backpack bomb near the finish line. Same thing happened during the London tube bombing as well. </p>

<p>Now let&#39;s look at other weird occurrences over the past few weeks; </p>

<blockquote>
<p>1 - For the past 10 days, sub-hunters have been orbiting off the coast of SoCal. 
2 - Hawker hunters have been observed off the east, and west coast
3 - on April 17th, the &quot;Doomsday Plane&quot; was orbiting the same SoCal area as the sub-hunters
4 - Russian bombers have buzzed Alaska twice this week
5 - China&#39;s bombers on high alert status
6 - Russian and Chinese troop movement on the NK border
7 - NK propaganda showing San Francisco being nuked
8 - A U.S Nuke Sniffer buzzed NK today 
9 - Atlanta has one major highway indefinitely shut down
10 - 3 weeks ago, a guy walks into the nuclear commission in Atlanta claiming to have &quot;Red Mercury&quot;
11 - Russian bombers and jets have now buzzed Alaska 4 times in 4 days 
12 - Large power outages in NYC, LA and San Fran today (4/21)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Tin foil hat time; what if North Korea&#39;s nuclear test isn&#39;t their usual underground test? What if it&#39;s a &quot;test&quot; of their newly unveiled submarine based ballistic missiles...from a sub off the coast of the U.S. </p>

<p>Now let&#39;s move on to other shit that has happened through history on 4/26: There is a curious list of nuclear related tests and other odd events that have happened on April 26th throughout history...the one which sticks out most to me he most is obviously Chernobyl. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Truthfully we starved out the koreans for years with our sanctions. Then finally once a new administration takes over kim and trump immediately go at it. Leading to further reduction of rights. Oil and coal trade is now cut. Russia and china are protecting their own border from refugee influx. I dont see china moving in. I see them standing outside protecting and looking out for themselves. </p>

<p>Despite North Korea&#39;s antiquated military, they still possess the largest submarine fleet in the world. <strong>Now I know what you&#39;re saying; &quot;but they use diesel subs&quot;. Yes, they do. But diesel subs do not run on diesel all the time. Actually, they only run the diesel engine to charge their battery. Otherwise, they run nearly silent on battery power.</strong> Added to which, why unveil the brand new sub-based ballistic missiles now?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I usually lurk conspiracy as opposed to posting here, but I just wanted to say: <strong>Thank you for being the only person on Reddit I&#39;ve seen who has any understanding on diesel submarines.</strong></p>

<p>I&#39;m in the navy and hunting submarines is what I do for a living. For the past few weeks, whenever North Korea&#39;s military capabilities are brought up, I always see Redditors blabbing on about how North Korea&#39;s submarines are diesels and we don&#39;t have to worry about them. I keep wanting to correct them but hold out because I know how Reddit gets when they get something in the hive mind and you point out that it&#39;s incorrect.</p>

<p>So the thing about diesel subs that gets Western navy&#39;s panties in a knot is how quiet they are. To understand why that&#39;s important you need to know how sonar works. There are two types of sonar, active and passive. Active sonar is where a ship or a submarine sends out a sound wave and waits for it to bounce off of an object to give it the direction and range. Very similar to how radar works. Passive sonar is where you use sensors and equipment to listen for an object, whether it be the sound of the submarine moving through the water, the sound of the engines running, the submarine using active sonar, or (god forbid) the sound of the torpedo tubes opening. You can tell what direction the sound is coming from, but because you&#39;re not sending out the pings you don&#39;t know for sure the exact range of the sub. We do have tactics and procedures we use to narrow down how far away the noise is, but passive sonar is still a lot harder to find a submarine with and how easily you can find a sub is largely based on how much noise the sub is making. </p>

<p>So, the advantage of active sonar over passive is it gives both direction and range, better at picking subs up. Disadvantage is that it pretty much instantly gives away your position to anyone listening. </p>

<p>The point I&#39;m trying to make is that noise can mean life or death when you&#39;re pitting ships vs subs or even subs vs other subs. And ships are already at a disadvantage because of how they&#39;re significantly louder they are than subs. Sailors on ships always joke &quot;The fastest way to find out if an enemy sub is working in your area is if one of your consorts blows up&quot; and submariners always joke &quot;There&#39;s two types of vessels: submarines and surface targets&quot;.</p>

<p>Nuclear subs are significantly faster and larger than diesel subs and can stay submerged longer and can carry larger payloads. They&#39;re doomsday weapons capable of striking inland targets. However, compared to diesels, they&#39;re noisey as hell. Nuclear generators make a lot of noise and the faster you go underwater the more noise you make. Diesel subs, by contrast, only use diesel to charge their batteries and then after that they rely on electricity from their batteries to power their engines. Which makes them <em>fucking quiet</em>. A lot more than nuclear submarines. And way more than surface ships. </p>

<p>So, I&#39;m not going to comment on the nuclear capability of North Korea or their submarine fleet. Yes, it&#39;s pretty old. Yes, there are still ways to find them. But you can&#39;t write them off because they&#39;re diesels. I&#39;d argue that you should worry about them more, but I might be biased because diesel subs are more used to hunt and kill ships and other subs and nuclear submarines can literally start armageddon. </p>

<p>Sorry to go on a long winded and only semi related rant, but as I said, it&#39;s nice to see someone on Reddit who isn&#39;t completely ignorant attempting to pass as an expert.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for not only the compliment, but the detailed explanation on sub-hunting. It seems a hell of a lot more difficult to locate a sub than I ever imagined. Fuck, I don&#39;t know how you guys are able to do that. </p>

<p>I have a question, and I touched upon this in my comment above, but; is it even feasible that North Korean subs could use the Long Beach port as cover of sorts? As in; could the traffic going in and out of there mask a passive sonar search? Or am I completely talking out of my ass with that one? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s definitely a pain in the ass and the funny thing is that it only gets more complicated. I gave something of a layman&#39;s explanation to try and give context, but the truth is anti-submarine warfare gets even more complicated when you factor in stuff like depth layers, oceanography, and even water temperature. And the perspective I gave was just from a surface combattant looking for a sub, helicopters and fixed wing aircraft are also utilized to find a sub. Lots of navy personnel find anti-submarine warfare to be extremely boring because of how slow it can be, but it is still interesting and it does still scare the high brass. There&#39;s something humbling about a diesel sub getting a simulated attack in on an aircraft carrier during an exercise without anyone in the task group knowing where it was. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV8MF-440xg">Here&#39;s a video of the Aussies firing a torpedo at a decommissioned ship to emphasize how subs can fuck shit up.</a></p>

<p>Now, to answer your question, the answer is kind of. Subs use heavy traffic areas all the time to hide their position. They will follow underneath large merchant ships and match their speed so if we either can&#39;t pick them up or if we do we think that the noise is just coming from the merchant ship. So you&#39;re right in the fact that a sub could mask its position and course with heavy traffic.</p>

<p>However, keep in mind that there are listening stations all over the ocean. They also use satellite imaging to see what subs leave what port and when. So it&#39;s not feasible that a North Korean sub could pop up in Long Beach while we still think it&#39;s docked on the Korean Peninsula, but it&#39;s definitely possible that a sub (especially a smaller one) could slip into a harbour while we were searching for her a hundred NM or so away. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Something I&#39;ve noticed with a lot of these posts is the &#39;catastrophic&#39; event always seems to be right around the corner. It&#39;s the carrot that keeps you believing until the new theory comes out. Nothing ever happens, nothing ever changes; yet a new nuclear attack, marital law, manufactured weather disaster or Zionist terrorist attack is right around the corner. </p>

<p>This sub isn&#39;t happy unless it&#39;s predicting Armageddon. I think some people here would rejoice if something did happen, killing hundreds of thousands. It would give you something to dissect and obsess over for a decade. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I respectfully disagree. </p>

<p>You don&#39;t think looking into possible false flags is useful? How are threads like this distracting? If it doesn&#39;t interest you, move on. I personally believe flat earth is bullshit, so I just ignore those threads and move on. </p>

<p>Just because I researched it does not mean I wish for it to happen. I&#39;m sure there are people who want these disasters to happen  (the greater part of /pol/ for example), but they are a small percentage. For folks like me, I do it to try and give people a head&#39;s up in the worst case scenario. </p>

<p>Part of understanding the greater conspiracies on this planet is realizing that false flags are just another tool the cabal uses to assert control, so why not actively try to figure out when or where one will come? </p>

<p>It&#39;s a conspiracy sub, and things like this should absolutely be discussed, if for nothing else than visibility <em>in case</em> something were to happen. </p>

<p>You know why? Because on the 1% chance that shit does get turned to glass, but one person saw a thread like this and said &quot;Im getting the fuck out&quot;, then it was worth the 30 minutes I put into researching my above comment. </p>
