        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Whether you consider the issue from a secular or Biblical perspective, all &quot;humans&quot; do not share a common ancestry. The idea that all humans are &quot;family&quot; is a lie propagated by the ruling Jewish Establishment and the apostate &quot;Judeo-Christian&quot; churches -- and supported by the fraudulent theory of evolution -- which serves as a basis for the &quot;multicultural&quot;, race-mixing, and &quot;one world community&quot; agenda that is designed to destroy the white race through mongrelization and absorption with the non-white races.</p>

<p>Biologically and scientifically speaking, how is it possible for the pure-blooded black, asian, and white races to have descended from Adam and Eve, Noah and his wife, or any other common ancestor? Could Adam and Eve reproduce and have black, white, and asian children? Of course not. That&#39;s biologically impossible.</p>

<p>The black, white, and asian races -- in their pure-blooded states, absent any mixing among the races -- are of completely different lineage. They were created separately, and are essentially different species of &quot;humans.&quot; The fact that separate races can interbreed (and produce hybrid species) is not proof of common origin or common species, as this phenomenon exists among other animals -- eg, lion and tiger can mate and produce a hybrid &quot;liger&quot;, horse and donkey to produce mule, etc.</p>

<p>The Bible, when translated and interpreted correctly, confirms the fact that Adam was not the first &quot;human.&quot; There were other people on the earth before Adam was created. That is why Cain feared other people would kill him after he was banished, and how Cain was able to find a wife, have his own descendants, and build a city after being banished from Adam &amp; Eve and their descendants.</p>

<p>Who, then, are the descendants of Adam and Eve? The evidence strongly indicates that it is the white race. The word &quot;Adam&quot; in the Hebrew is &quot;aw-dam&#39;&quot;, which means &quot;to show blood (in the face), i.e. flush or turn rosy&quot;. Only the white race can blush and show blood in the face.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>White people originated in the Mid East.  That&#39;s why my original post was about.   Only the white race descends from Adam and Eve.  The true descendants of the Israelites are the Anglo-Saxon, Germanic, and kindred European peoples.   The Israelites migrated into Europe after they were released from the Assyrian and Babylonian captivities, around 700 BC and 500 BC respectively.</p>

<p>The people who created great civilizations in the Mid East thousands of years ago were WHITE.  They have since migrated all over the earth.  For instance, the ancient Egyptian pharoahs were white.

<p>They also purposefully disenfranchised the ethnic communities of Western countries by segregating them, flooding them with drugs, profiling them through law enforcement etc. This obviously creates disdain for the overwhengly white establishment they perceive as being responsible.

<p>Nope nope and nope.  All of them were brown people in various degrees.      </p>

<p>Blondness was and is still a recessive mutation and is NOT a common trait unless +97% of the population is blond, like in the Nordic countries.<br/>
The middle east is not the Nordic area of the world, all of the people in the middle east get far too much exposure to the sun to be white and blond.  </p>

<p>No, a retard believe in your master race, hybrid baby nonsense. A normal person believes in evolution, because it&#39;s been heavily proven.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Or believes that a first human pair could reproduce and have white, black, and asian children.</p>

<p>1) No. A pair of humans would have their children die due to inbreeding in a few gens. You need a few breeding pairs to avoid that.</p>

<p>2) it&#39;s called evolution, it can lead to all the differences between the races.</p>

<p>Of course not, jews are clearly the master race. i mean you pointed it out yourself when you claimed that jew rule the world. How could they do that if they weren&#39;t the master race?</p>

<p>All of the middle east was brown</p>

<p>Living in colder northern climates meant covering up and much less exposure to the sun - lighter, paler skin was the result. Extracting resources from the ground (like farming) also meant northern peoples required a bit more ingenuity to survive than southern latitudes with their ideal sunny, tropical weather. That ingenuity wasn&#39;t based on intelligence or &quot;whiteness&quot;, but necessity. Innovate or die. It&#39;s a microcosm for all of nature</p>

<ul>
<li><p>We don&#39;t live outdoors anymore. By and large we don&#39;t farm, raise animals, or hang outside a majority of our work lives like we used to, hence we don&#39;t get nearly the sun exposure we used to either</p></li>
<li><p>Humans travel and mate with humans from all over the world. Light, dark, it all gets mixed and the trend goes to lighter skin colors, not darker ones. Australians are not limited to mating with Australians</p></li>
<li><p>The modern world is more aware of sun exposure than ever. Women wear makeup, people wear lotions and sunblock, we wear more hats and longer sleeved clothing</p></li>
<li><p>If all of the above were not true, the answer to your question is Yes, we would see a marked change in skin color over time and those people would naturally acclimate to their environment. But because we have all the modern accoutrements like air travel, office jobs, nice clothing, and sun block it couldn&#39;t happen like the old world</p></li>

<p>Yea, because of minor differences in bone structure. It&#39;s one of those superficial differences I mentioned earier</p>

<p>It&#39;s less than .1% different. That&#39;s just a fact. </p>

<p>superficial differences</p>

<p>You mean those things that change with class and not race? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>For starters, you claim adherence to the concepts of Christian Identity, a hate group.  One only needs to read their literature to see.  CI is monitored by the FBI as well.  Also, you spoke poorly of &quot;Arabs&quot; (your term), mixed-race people, Jews, etc.  </p>

<p>For sake of honesty, I look down on some people too, but only because of certain personal choices, not the things they can&#39;t control, such as their race.  For example, I think people in the Christian Identity movement are weak-minded losers who can&#39;t acknowledge or accept their own personal failures, so they lash out at others to make themselves feel better. They need to scapegoat others because they are too weak to make positive changes in their own lives.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>1) The Bible is not a scientific source. Any attempt to introduce it as evidence to support a racial theory is preposterous. Science is based on facts, not myths and legends.</p>

<p>2) Humans around the world are of the same species, <em>Homo sapiens</em> (around 200,000 years old), and can accordingly produce fertile offspring, unlike hybrid mules and ligers, which only reproduce in exceptionally rare cases. However, even early modern humans interbred with Neaderthals, as small traces of their DNA (1-4%) are still present in modern-day non-African people, including Europeans and Asians.  </p>

Any differences that you see on the surface, like hair, eye, or skin color are merely relatively short-term adaptations (in our long-term history) to local climate, geography, and diet.

</blockquote>

<p>The Christian Bible may be &quot;historically&quot; accurate in some aspects because it is based on even older written histories compiled by the Jews around 450B.C., called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanakh">Tanekh</a>, or <em>Hebrew Bible</em>. However, outside of names of rulers and kingdoms, <strong>there is absolutely no evidence whatsoever for any of the supernatural or claims in either the Old or New Testament</strong>, for example, the creation of Adam and Eve, the worldwide flood, etc., but especially the existence of God. That said, one cannot prove there was ever any 10 Commandments written by God in stone. Nor is there any mention of Jesus in any contemporary historical narrative outside of the Bible itself.    </p>

<p>2) If you call science preposterous just because it doesn&#39;t confirm your bias, then you simply can&#39;t handle the truth. The Catholic church did the same when Galileo aimed to prove that the Earth circled the sun back in the 17th century. It wasn&#39;t until 1992 that Pope John Paul II even apologized for that, so I won&#39;t be holding my breath waiting on you to admit you&#39;re wrong either. </p>

<p>3) DNA testing proves no such thing. DNA proves that the separate races have unique DNA profiles. The race of a person can be identified from their DNA. The races do not have identical DNA. </p>

<p>Um, no one said we all have identical DNA. Even you and your siblings don&#39;t have identical DNA. You have 99.95% identical DNA, but any 2 humans on Earth have 99.9% same DNA. That&#39;s a fact. You clearly don&#39;t understand science, so you don&#39;t trust it. However, you choose to believe the myths and legend of the Bible.
Fine, but don&#39;t expect people to ignore an irrational argument. Which begs the question, why are you even posting here if you&#39;re going to just close your eyes, put your fingers in your ears, and keep repeating &quot;it&#39;s all a bunch of lies&quot; to yourself?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Examples of historical inaccuracy in the Bible--</p>

<p>Enslavement in Egypt and wandering through the desert - despite there being supposedly hundreds of thousands or millions of Jews involved in this, there is no archaeological record of it happening.</p>

<p>Destroying of the walls of Jericho - Jericho did exist but archaeologists have found that it was destroyed at a different time and by different methods than described in the Bible.</p>

<p>Prophecy of Tyre - Prophecy claims the city of tyre will be destroyed and never rebuilt. It still exists to this day.</p>

<p>All of Jesus Life - Only one non-religious contemporary of Jesus writes about him (Josephus) and all he says is that he was a leader of a religious sect. Nothing about all the amazing miracles and world going dark that supposedly happened.</p>

<p>I can keep going, but there are about a billion lists you can look up for yourself. Regardless, even these few should call into question for you whether or not the Bible has been &quot;proven over and over to be completely accurate. And if none of the counter examples to your point are robust enough evidence for you to at least wonder about the complete historicity of the bible, maybe ask yourself why every time something contradicts the views you already hold, you just say that piece of evidence doesn&#39;t count.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe you&#39;ve changed your beliefs about other things but I see how you&#39;re responding on questions on this subject and you&#39;re responding like a dogmatist.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The mainstream archaeologists are wrong about Jericho. Their carbon-dating is wrong.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s a tactic the church teaches you. Simply discredit any dissenting voices. Learn them just enough to give them a straw man representation, and then refute it. It makes you feel like you&#39;ve explored all the options and christianity is simply the most true. But let me tell you man, it&#39;s so much more fulfilling to give an honest voice to the ideas that disagree with you. To really look and see if the white race is superior, by listening to people who think it&#39;s NOT. How else will you know if what you know is true? If it is, then your beliefs shouldn&#39;t be threatened anyway, right?</p>

<p>And I know you&#39;ll want to say you have looked at all the sides, but honestly consider if you have. Evolutionary theorists are smart people, just like you, and there&#39;s a reason that almost all of them agree that evolution is more or less what happened. And consider that your reaction in reading that, in wanting to respond with, &quot;Yeah well the scientific establishment is run by jewish sjw cucks,&quot; consider that that might be another mental tactic that the &quot;meme&quot; of christianity has taught to you in order to be able to immediately discount any dissenting view without ever considering it.</p>

<p>I perfectly understand the theory of evolution.  I&#39;ve had the garbage force fed to me my entire life. I went to public schools in the USA.  And I have a &quot;vast&quot; knowledge of the Bible, when compared to the average person.  I&#39;m hardly someone ignorant of these subjects.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When you claim that races have different DNA, you are being pedantically ridiculous. Of course they do. <em>We all of have different DNA</em> except for identical twins. </p>

<p>When you claim certain races aren&#39;t human, you clearly have no idea how speciation works. All races can reproduce with one another. The definition of a species is literally &quot;can produce fertile offspring&quot;.</p>

<p>That shit is embarrassingly, awfully, totally ignorant and frankly, unintelligent. Just stop. Science isn&#39;t the Bible. Whatever bible based science claims you are reading are almost certainly completely ridiculous. Go learn something about this stuff.</p>

<p>Natural selection acts on phenotypes, resulting in expression of the genetic change in the later generation.  You claim to &quot;fully understand evolution&quot;, yet you FAIL at even the most basic scientific concept at the core of the theory! You think this concept is the &quot;latest delusional theory&quot;.  You not only do not have &quot;sufficient knowledge of the theory of evolution&quot;, you FAIL at the very basic concept!

<p>These aren&#39;t all about evolution, but they&#39;re all truth claims where you&#39;re rejecting millions of experiments and pieces of evidence. I know you hate the mainstream and blah. But you should think about why so few people believe your alternative beliefs. Sure there are flaws in the mainstream versions, but if you apply the same standards to your beliefs I know you&#39;ll find even more massive holes in them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a concept called steelmanning. After your opponent speaks, you restate their position in a such a way that they would say, I wish I had described it like that. It shows that you understand what they believe and you&#39;re responding to what they actually believe, rather than your own distorted version of it. Do you think that your version of evolution is such that an evolutionary theorist would say, Yeah, I would describe it that way. Because if it&#39;s not, then that means you&#39;re not actually arguing against evolution, you&#39;re just arguing against your made-up, easy-to-argue-against version of it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, your simply rejecting how much the malleable canine family can change in 20,000 which is extraordinary when you can see how much a breed can change in size and character in less than 100 years.</p>

<p>Seriously, there is nothing biologically problematic in getting breed populations to diverge in that time. We&#39;re not talking about hybrid breeds here we are talking about taking litters of pups and consistently taking (say) the largest ones to breed from. </p>

<p>The fossil evidence suggest that the first canines (which wouldn&#39;t have been like a modern wolf) sprang from the <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miacoidea">http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miacoidea</a> &quot; mostly small carnivores superficially reminiscent of martens or civets.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hello, 
A fascinating read. I respect your courage to voice an opinion so diffident to everyone else&#39;s. I wanted to say a couple of things about Physics. </p>

<p>As a person with a degree in science I felt that I just had to reply to this post. Physics is an empirical science. This means that it only concerns itself with questions that can be answered by performing experiments and gathering data. There things which can be measured and experimented upon (width of the Observable Universe, density of a proton? half life of radioactive particles or the rate of expansion of Space). Whether the universe is infinite in time and/or space hasn&#39;t been confirmed yet. We&#39;ve only got it figured ~13,000,000,000 years backwards and then we&#39;ve hit a problem that we don&#39;t understand (yet)- Singularity. It also is not confirmed whether it has existed forever or not (expanding and collapsing in cycles similar to cycles of a pendulum). This means that we don&#39;t know whether the universe had a beginning. (What is a beginning anyways if it isn&#39;t an end of some previous state?) Some questions simply don&#39;t have answers. It&#39;s a logical fallacy to assume an answer before acquiring data to analyse.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t really understand why the thermodynamics states that universe cannot have existed forever. Please, elaborate. </p>

<p>I just wonder: where does your information come from? It seems like you&#39;ve replaced difficult to understand facts with your opinions. </p>

<p>There has been no empirical experiment devised yet that proves that god does or doesn&#39;t exist. I am fairly confident about that. This means that existence of God is a question outside the realm of science. Which is a system that confirms facts through empirical evidence. Without a designed, repeatable experiment the existence of God cannot be scientifically pondered upon. Thus it&#39;s illogical to evoke science as a proof of Gods existence. It&#39;s like trying to use a 30cm ruler to measure the colour schemes of one&#39;s favourite memory. It simply isn&#39;t the right tool for that task and none has been devised yet. To the best of my knowledge that is. </p>

<p>As someone has said before, the egyptians and later the arabs were  living in splendor while europeans were eating mud. The Aztecs had a bigger city than anything in europe, complete with schools, water services and parks. And I don&#39;t believe any german or Englishman would be willing to let you appropriate their cultural heritage as something you had any part in.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t want limitations because you only have one resource for the creation myth...a 2,000 year old book.  You know without this ONE book, you have zero argument.</p>

<p>There are thousands and thousands of research documents supporting evolutionary theory. You are typing on a device which allows you to access this information and learn so, so much.  </p>

<p>Google evolutionary theory, do some reading, and get back to me when you understand concepts such as observation and extrapolation to larger groups, taxonomic patterns of relationships among organisms, vestigial organs, biochemical similarities, genetic drift, etc..  </p>

<p>Since you are one who believes the creation myth, I suspect it will take you some time to ramp up to debate level, and I don&#39;t have time to bring you up to a high school-level understanding of science.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I had to get condescending because your a dense and there was no other way to get the point across.  I was aiming for your shoelaces with my comments, but they still went over your head.  The point is that while there are literally THOUSANDS of documents supporting evolution, you have one old book.  Without that book, you have nothing!  There is not even any credible evidence for Jesus outside of the bible. It is a book of stories, with supernatural effects thrown in to arouse emotions.  If you are looking to the bible for scientific answers, you&#39;re going to come up with nothing.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t need to convert anyone because most thinking people understand the theory evolution is supported by facts.  Just because you don&#39;t agree with the fact dos not negate them.  These facts still exist.  You can&#39;t say that about burning bushes or dead men rising from a grave.  These things do not happen in reality.</p>

<p>The theory of evolution is one of the most preposterous ideas in the history of mankind. There is no evidence whatsoever to support it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This comment alone shows the depth of your ignorance, and I mean that with full condescension.  A simple Google search will put plenty of evidence right before your eyes.  You are making the choice to not look into all the evidence supporting evolutionary theory.  </p>

<p>The limitations on the discussion rest fully in your court.  You have no source other than the bible, and you appear to have not even a basic understanding of science or evolutionary theory.  If you did, I would have expected to see something of it by now.  </p>

<p>And no, I won&#39;t debate you for a few reasons. First, your position is &quot;God did it.&quot;, and there is no evidence for any god at all.  So you&#39;d have to prove the existence of one before you can even say the words &quot;God did it&quot;.  Otherwise, it&#39;s just me sharing facts and you replying &quot;God did it&quot;. Second, because you haven&#39;t used facts or reason to reach your beliefs, so no amount of facts or reason will move you away from them.  Trying to put facts in front of you would be the proverbial &quot;pearls before swine&quot;.  (That&#39;s a bible reference, btw.)</p>

<p>Lastly, I won&#39;t continue because you put forth information from a Christian Identity website and espoused similar beliefs in your post and comments.  </p>

<p>Christian Identity is a known hate group.  You are promoting their beliefs.  I&#39;m just here to point out to you what is obvious to so many others; your beliefs are hateful, outdated, and have no relevance.  </p>

<p>I haven&#39;t lost a thing.  You have failed to show even a basic understanding of science.  When you can demonstrate you&#39;ve grasped the concepts I mentioned earlier, we&#39;ll talk.  Until then, good luck with your little hate group.</p>

<p>The theory of evolution is absolute horse shit.  There is ZERO evidence to support it whatsoever.  Only frauds and hoaxes, like Ernst Haeckel&#39;s faked &quot;embryo drawings&quot;, &quot;Piltdown man&quot;, and &quot;Nebraska man&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As much as we try to enforce the rules as consistently as possible, each mod interprets them slightly differently when it comes to applying them, trying to uphold the spirit of the rule.

Rule 10 specifically (but not exclusively) prohibits users from calling others shills or trolls. </p>

<p>The problem if we let users make indirect but clear implications of these accusations or insults is that the real problem users (which I don&#39;t at present think you are) just couch their language in thinly veiled suggestion, and we end up back where we started, with users attacking <em>users</em>. </p>

<p>We&#39;re more likely to let something like that slide than a direct accusation, but I wouldn&#39;t count on it. I think you&#39;d be better off saying something like &quot;I disagree with you on x, y, z, but I don&#39;t think you&#39;re arguing in good faith so I won&#39;t continue this conversation.&quot; If the user is truly a troll, what they want is to provoke you and drag you into a conversation you cannot &quot;win,&quot; and get you to break our rules. </p>

<p>Strange that so many extremely religious, anti-jewish, racist, hateful people have found their way here recently.</p>

<p>If anyone hasn&#39;t noticed, this has a lot to do with /altright, their new home at /pussypass, the Antifa craziness, and an overall push by white nationalists to infiltrate different places on this site. It ramped up within the past two weeks, here in this sub at least. (I observe such things).</p>

<p>Surprisingly, on such hot-button issues, most of the people here are being cordial and inquisitive. OP is not interested in constructive discussion or debate though, that much is clear by reading the thread.</p>

<p>He&#39;s here to push his agenda and perhaps seek out/recruit like-minded people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For starters, you claim adherence to the concepts of Christian Identity, a hate group.  One only needs to read their literature to see.  CI is monitored by the FBI as well.  Also, you spoke poorly of &quot;Arabs&quot; (your term), mixed-race people, Jews, etc.  </p>

<p>For sake of honesty, I look down on some people too, but only because of certain personal choices, not the things they can&#39;t control, such as their race.  For example, I think people in the Christian Identity movement are weak-minded losers who can&#39;t acknowledge or accept their own personal failures, so they lash out at others to make themselves feel better. They need to scapegoat others because they are too weak to make positive changes in their own lives.  </p>
