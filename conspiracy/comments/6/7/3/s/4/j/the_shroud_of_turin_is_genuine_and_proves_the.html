        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The Shroud of Turin, if genuine, is one of the most important historical artifacts or records that conclusively proves the reality of the life of the &quot;Jesus&quot; of Nazareth, his death, and even his resurrection.</p>

<p>Archaeologists, medical doctors, scientists, and others have extensively analyzed the Shroud, and there is growing concensus that it is authentic. They cannot find any evidence that it is a forgery, and have determined that it would be far too difficult, if not impossible, to do so. They cannot explain how the image on the shroud was created.</p>

<p>The image on the shroud (which could not have been painted) depicts wounds on the body of a man exactly corresponding to the accounts in the Bible. The image has been found to have been made with actual human blood. The blood stains (image) show no sign of smearing or pulling apart as would be the case if a body were unwrapped while removing it (possible explanation: the body &quot;vanished&quot; and the cloth was left behind).</p>

<p>Further evidence:</p>

<ol>
<li>Scourge marks on the shoulders, back, and legs of the man of the shroud match the flagrum (roman whip) which has three leather thongs. Wounds one the forehead from the crown of thorns are visible.</li>
<li>Recently, a researcher analyzed some visible writing on the shroud and claims to have translated the writing, finding that it effectively was a &quot;death certificate&quot;, written in greek, latin, and aramaic -- containing the greek words &quot;(I)esou(s) Nnazarennos&quot;, or &quot;Jesus the Nazarene&quot;....from a piece of paper placed on the body containing that writing.</li>
<li>The image indicates that coins were placed over the eyes of the corpse, and they have found coin-lettering consistent with the lepton (widow&#39;s mite) minted by Pontius Pilate between 29 - 32 AD.</li>
<li>Analysis has shows that pollen and floral imprints found in the Shroud only exist in the area around Jerusalem.</li>
<li>Chemical analysis of travertine aragonite calcium, found on in the Shroud&#39;s fabric, strongly suggests it was once in direct physical contact with one of Jerusalem&#39;s limestone caves or tombs.</li>
</ol>

    <div class="md"><p>How wrong you are my brother. Want more signs of His coming soon? Look up the great sign of Revelation 12 that occurs Sept 23 of this very year. Time is short.</p>

<p>The 7 year tribulation that is about to come upon this fallen wicked world is the last and final oppurtunity to accept the truth and reality that that there are many false &quot;gods&quot; but there is only One True Living God, that loves you so much, that he gave Himself as the attoning sacrifice for all our sins. ALL sin. His name is Yeshua (Jesus) the Christ/Messiah.</p>

<p>But we do have a choice to make. Choose to accept, or choose to reject. That is the price of free will, you can choose eternal death if you wish.</p>

<p>One choice.
Two paths to choose from.
No neutral ground.</p>

<p>These are the last days. You don&#39;t even need to be a believer to be able to see we are coming to a breaking point. Everything we are seeing today, the very conspiracies unearthed in this sub are pre-fulfillment of prophecy.</p>

<p>The image on the shroud (which could not have been painted)</p>

<p>Maybe not, but it has been recreated using other means.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;New test dates Shroud of Turin to era of Christ&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It does?.. let&#39;s see:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The new test, by scientists at the University of Padua in northern Italy, used the same fibers from the 1988 tests but disputes the findings. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>....</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It determined that the earlier results may have been skewed by contamination from fibers used to repair the cloth when it was damaged by fire in the Middle Ages</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They used the same contaminated fibers but came up with different results? Interesting.</p>

<p>An alternative view:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Nickell pointed out that Fanti&#39;s tests &quot;involve three different procedures — each with its own problems — which are then averaged together to produce the result.&quot; He said that stands in contrast with 1988&#39;s mass spectrometry tests, which yielded a date range between 1260 and 1390. Fanti says those earlier tests were not &quot;statistically reliable,&quot; but Nickell and most scientists are sticking with the verdict rendered in 1988.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Because there&#39;s &quot;no degree of security&quot; as to the authenticity of the fiber samples, the shroud&#39;s custodians &quot;cannot recognize any serious value to the results of these alleged experiments,&quot; Nosiglia said in a statement quoted by La Stampa&#39;s Vatican Insider. The archbishop&#39;s comments &quot;put stakes into Fanti&#39;s work,&quot; Vatican Insider reported.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sounds like this Fanti guy set out to prove something and, unsurprisingly, did.</p>

<p>Who is he?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>From a religious point of view, I am sure that the Holy Shroud is authentic and it
is the most important Relic of Christianity. This because, following a precise
question of mine, I had a personal “answer” in 1998 in front of the Relic.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.shroud.com/pdfs/Fanti-refl.pdf">https://www.shroud.com/pdfs/Fanti-refl.pdf</a></p>

<p>Ah, I see... he is a &quot;true believer&quot; that set out to prove the shroud was real as he believed it to be, and using methods that have been called into question, did exactly that.</p>

<p>Big surprise.</p>
