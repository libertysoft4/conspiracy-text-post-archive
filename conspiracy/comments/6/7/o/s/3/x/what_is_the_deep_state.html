    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure there is an established definition. How I have come to understand the deep state is that it is a somewhat large group of people who are NOT elected officials, and therefore are not accountable to the public. I agree that most politicians are not held accountable, but we know who they are and with enough pressure it is possible to put one out of office. By contrast, the deep state is unknown and untouchable. To put simply the deep state is the people who manage and operate the systems of money in politics from behind the scenes.</p>

<p>The people who are part of the deep state are there to coerce the government into doing things that benefit themselves or their respective organizations.  Lower level people are simply trying to hold on to their government funded (often high paying) jobs while higher level people are actively playing a role in the government policy making. </p>

<p>Other people might like to define the deep state as a few people calling all the shots and running the puppet show in front (i.e. The 7th Floor Group). If these people exist they are certainly part of the deep state; however, this idea is difficult to prove with absolute certainty. Which leaves an easy avenue for people to deny it&#39;s existence. On the other hand, the definition I laid out would encompass these few people plus the unelected influencers who certainly exist. </p>

<p>Anyone care to critique this definition?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Neocons/Neoliberal/CIA.</p>

<p>The first two serve the interests of the CIA though, either through blackmail or bribery (or better yet, bribery turned into blackmail.)</p>

<p>The CIA has factions within it that serve many disparate interests, but above all they serve and protect their agency, even above the interests of the country. They have been playing a REALLY long game of proxy war with Russia over the middle east, and despite how history is frames, the cold war NEVER ended.</p>

<p>The pentagon is not the same as the deep state though, in spite of how they are frequently bundled together with the term &quot;military industrial complex&quot;. The pentagon is more often than not the victims of misinformation by the CIA and private intelligence contractors who use them as a cudgel, most often to further the interests of the CIA many clandestine wars and to beef up spending for military contractors.</p>

<p>The deep state also runs the media in the majority of western countries and uses them to shape the public&#39;s perception about policy both domestic and international. They also use this tool to ruin people who work against their interest.</p>
