Let&#39;s make sure we keep a nonpartisan attitude and maintain a logical and reason based state of mind with whatever happens today.

    <div class="md"><p>You want Marshall law? You want the grocery stores to run out of food? I&#39;m young man, I haven&#39;t had enough time to prepare to be self sustaining in the event of total societal collapse. </p>

<p>Either way, I just don&#39;t see it happening. Tv shows and movies that depict apocalyptic society is very skewed from reality imo. I think people would work together. Form small communities. At least outside of the major cities. Major cities will probably start eating each other. But I think that communities would form, people would protect each other and feed each other. </p>

<p>people holed up on their farms in the country with their 8 kids and 30 guns are the ones who are going to be killing each other for food.  they already think the government is after them so they&#39;re already the most paranoid.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lots of people were injured. A girl wearing a red &quot;Make Bitcoin Great Again&quot; cap was pepper sprayed by some asshole in a black hoodie with a black mask while being interviewed. </p>

<p>The Berkely riots have been organized by public school teachers. You don&#39;t think the kids who those teachers have taught to riot and fuck shit up, wouldn&#39;t fuck shit up if all of the power went out and everything? The woman who organized a lot of it said that Milo was a bunch of -isms including homophobic. Flamboyantly gay Milo. But he has some conservative positions on policy, so he must be a Nazi, and we have to protect our freedom of speech from people like him. </p>

<p>That&#39;s the kind of people we&#39;re dealing with. They&#39;re idiots. And they have a lot of public influence. That&#39;s not good in my opinion, and I believe that if they were give the opportunity, they would begin &quot;cleansing&quot; California of &quot;Nazis&quot; and literally murder anyone who doesn&#39;t bend the knee to their delusion. Funded by Soros.</p>

<p>Also if people dont think some of these back wood folks wouldnt just block roads or destroy bridges to keep the vast amount of insiders out.  It is something to be heavily considered.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Having been born and lived mostly in the country I&#39;ll say that I completely disagree with you.  I&#39;ve waved and attempted to at least be cordial and get acquainted with neighbors on both sides of my house in the city.  After a year neither waves back, looks at me when I&#39;m outside, and frankly I&#39;ve given up, fuck them.  Now whenever I head out to visit around my Dads house, everyone waves at everyone and he always has a story about any number of the neighbors stopping by just to shoot the shit and see how each other are doing.  I bought a house in the city for dirt cheap but I&#39;m hoping to get my house sold in a few years and buy a tract of land from my family just to escape the assholes.  Cities will eat themselves in days.</p>

<p>Well of course they are, the goal is to entertain! Would Walking Dead be very good if they lived their lives in peace once they get to Alexandria? Or The Governor worked <em>with</em> them to turn the prison into a haven for humanity? They need to throw in human-related strife. They can&#39;t just kill zombies for 8 years.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>probably would depend on what happens and during what time of year, because in more northen places, like Canada or the Mid west in the US food would become scarce quickly in the winter if there are no major food storages.
Walking dead like apocholapse would not likly be much of a problem as the zombies would run out of food pretty quick, and the military would set up safe zones and bomb any area that was to infested into oblivion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right on. And you know we discuss all of these subjects as if they are real. I will speak for myself here, but I imagine other veterans of places like this are much the same way. I will entertain anything as true and real for the purpose of exploring the idea. But, this is an intellectual exercise, and not an indication of actual beliefs. To get the most out of places like this, suspending disbelief is required.</p>

<p>I think the misunderstanding of that by outsiders is what gets us characterized as crazy. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I believe what would be considered some weird ass shit too I&#39;m sure. But in general, the stereotype of tinfoil hat wearing ultra-paranoid bunker dwellers isn&#39;t accurate at all. </p>
