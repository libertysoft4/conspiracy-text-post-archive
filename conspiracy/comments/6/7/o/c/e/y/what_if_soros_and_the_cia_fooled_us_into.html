<p>On April 18th thru May 5th, 2017, state, local, and federal organizations alike are planning for Operation Gotham Shield 2017 — a major nuclear detonation drill in the New York-New Jersey area, along with the U.S.-Canadian border. During this exercise, 4 nuclear devices, 2 of which are rendered “safe” during the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) Vital Archer Exercise, and one successful 10kt detonation in the NYC/NJ area, along with one smaller detonation on the U.S./Canadian border are to take place.
Among the organizations involved are:
– U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)
– U.S. Department of Defense (DOD)
– U.S. Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO)
– U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)
– U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)
– U.S. Northern Command (NORTHCOM)
– State of New Jersey Office of Emergency Management
– State of New York Office of Emergency Management
– City of New York Office of Emergency Management</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OP is over-estimating the Cabal&#39;s threat level assessment of the conspiracy research crowd. More than likely this is further preparation for an event that is yet to happen, a recognition of fact - that the Executive is fully incompetent and unable to provide leadership in a time of crisis.

    <div class="md"><p>I will never understand how people will go out and say that &quot;the Executive is fully incompetent and unable to provide leadership in a time of crisis&quot;. What exactly about the current Executive makes him so much more incompetent than say, Obama? If anything the Executive has had way more leadership experience in a time of crisis, at least from a business standpoint, than a &quot;community organizer&quot; and &quot;freshman senator&quot; from Chicago. I mean at the very least, the current Executive had navigated his business through at least two real estate bubbles popping and the dotcom crash.

<p>The current executive would have objectively made more money had he simply earned interest on the lump sum. Fact. </p>

<p>More importantly, you immediately took my statement to mean TRUMP, when what I said was THE EXECUTIVE. As in, the branch of government. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No you brought up an argument about his wealth, which has nothing to do with him (mostly) successfully navigating his real estate business through two real estate bubbles and the dotcom boom. Therefore, my point is, he is not as incompetent in a time of crisis as someone who had limited life experience compared to his. I&#39;m not the biggest fan of the guy, I can get behind some of his policy ideas better than those of Obama but he isn&#39;t the savior. The memes are great though. </p>
