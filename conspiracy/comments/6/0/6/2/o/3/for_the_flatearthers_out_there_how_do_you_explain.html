    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve got a simple question for you. The theory of relativity posits that mass bends the &quot;fabric&quot; of spacetime, in turn producing &quot;ripples&quot; across the universe which we experience as gravitational waves. This &quot;bending&quot; of spacetime is also what causes astronomical bodies to orbit.</p>

<p>So, what exactly are the properties of space and time that allow them to be bent by mass? Height? Width? Depth? Breadth? Alternatively, according to our laws of physics, how is mass able to bend or curve something that has no physical properties?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The fact is, although we do have accurate methods of measuring relativity . (time, space , mass) it gets thrown out then window when quantum mechanics get involved. Even the act of measuring and quantifying (heh) attributes, has massive ramifications  and changes the very nature of what you&#39;re trying to do in the first place.... </p>

<p>TLDR. our mathematics is good, but not done or complete.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>H, W, D are physical properties so I don&#39;t quite get the question.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not a physicist, I couldn&#39;t tell you.  But I can tell you that I disagree with some of the theory of relativity.  And at the quantum level it just completely breaks down.  I think FTL travel is possible.  I think dark matter plays a bigger role in our univers than people think.</p>

<p>Just because you (and I) don&#39;t fully comprehend the upper levels of science and scientific theory doesn&#39;t automatically mean we&#39;re being lied to.  </p>

<p>Space-time is an all encompassing dimension, it is what mass exists in not an object in and of itself. To say mass has no affect on that in which it exists seems a little silly, even to a layman like me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re absolutely correct. H, W, &amp; D are all physical properties, and both space and time lack these properties.</p>

<p>In order for mass to bend or curve space-time, there must be a precondition. Space and time must posses physical properties in order for them to be physically acted upon. I think we can both agree that neither space not time possess any physical properties.</p>

<p>Your last two sentences are very interesting to me and I think they speak to the irrationality of some of contemporary sciences modern theories.</p>

<p>You concede the point that space-time is not a physical object, yet inexplicably believe it can be physically affected by mass. That is very peculiar to me. It seems silly to you to believe mass has no effect on that in which it exists, but it is irrational to me to believe that space-time doesn&#39;t adhere to the laws of physics.</p>

<p>I am no astrophysicist either, but what causes concern for me is that the individuals who are astrophysicists have no explanation for this either.</p>

<p>If something as paramount as gravity cannot be adequately explained by asking elementary questions, is it rational to base the entire model of our universe on this?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Would you say magnatism has physical properties?  </p>

<p>Space-time does adhere to the laws of physics because the concept of space-time was born of physics. Physical objects exist in space time.  Physics has to consider space-time because without it physics would not exist.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Drewcifer419, we have not sufficiently resolved the issue of space-time, so it is irresponsible of us to attempt to shift the subject to magnetism. Once we resolve the issue of spacetime, I would be happy to discuss magnetism.</p>

<p>I have to disagree with you here. I don&#39;t believe space-time was born of physics; if it were, there would be an adequate physics based explanation as to how mass bends or curves something that has no physical properties. </p>

<p>The theory of relativity espouses that space-time is a fabric e.g. a physical medium that can be acted upon. Now, what exactly is the fabric of space-time composed of? Space &amp; time? That would be a circular definition, and is not adequate in defining the composition of space-time. Is it composed of higgs boson particles? Gravitons? Dark matter? None of these entities have actually been observed in the real world and only exist in theory. The heliocentric model of the universe is utterly dependent on the theory of relativity, yet we are unable to adequately explain how exactly space-time is manipulated. That is something I unfortunately cannot overlook.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure I understand your illustration. Regardless of the dynamics of the relationship between the paint and the canvas, it is unquestionable that the canvas has physical properties. It can be seen, felt, smelled, even tasted if you were so inclined to experience that. The canvas has length, width, height, texture, etc. all qualitative physical properties meaning it can be physically acted upon. These, nor any other physical properties, are not present in space-time, so it is irrational to say that it can be physically acted upon.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s the thing. Mathematics, no matter how complex and esoteric, doesn&#39;t EXPLAIN things. By it&#39;s very nature, it can&#39;t because it&#39;s a descriptive language. There is a key distinction between describing something and explaining something.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t need mathematics to explain gene mutation or photosynthesis or electromagnetic induction. Each are complex linear processes that can be easily explained using real world terms. These are physics based explanations with no need for complex mathematical formulas.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure why you keep mention us being lied to. I never even alluded to the notion of us being lied to, you introduced that into the discussion. All I&#39;m doing is scrutinizing the information we&#39;ve been given and critically assessing its validity. I for one can&#39;t accept the notion that something as important as the nature of our universe can only be understood by a select group of people in an esoteric language they created (because mathematics is a language), but you&#39;ve made it apparent that you can accept that. I respect your rights to have faith in your belief system, and as long as you are happy in your beliefs that&#39;s all that matters.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>that&#39;s not even the question to be asking, the real question is this: </p>

<p>If the earth is traveling through space, via our own solar system, and as we&#39;re told we&#39;re expanding outwards as is all things in the universe, how would it or could it be possible that the stars are in the exact same spots, that they haven&#39;t fluctuated or moved from each other?</p>

<p>The pyramids of Giza is the best example, still to this day they line up perfectly with Orion, if everything is traveling through space, subject to gravity and &#39;random&#39; events in space, then how did something humans supposedly built around 2589 and 2504 BC, still show alignment with stars that are 240-1300 light years away? </p>

Do objects in space not interact with each other? does gravity not pull to large objects together, how is it that everything is seemingly frozen in place by gravity, yet at the same time being pulled together under gravity?

<p>Of course they do, that&#39;s exactly why they act in such a predictable way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly my point. Flat-earthers say the moon only looks like it&#39;s drpping below the horizon because of perspective. But if that were the case the moon would shrink away, not look larger from our &quot;perspective.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Except that the moon being larger on the horizon is simply an optical illusion.  Measuring the diameter with a camera is easy enough and demonstrates that it&#39;s effectively the same size whether it&#39;s above or on the horizon.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Whoa whoa, we freaking revolve around the center of the galaxy every 230 million years? That actually seems short, that means the dinosaurs were in a completely different part of the galaxy. Strange to think about it. If we had time machines we would have to account for galactic positioning of our star to reach our planet maybe?</p>
