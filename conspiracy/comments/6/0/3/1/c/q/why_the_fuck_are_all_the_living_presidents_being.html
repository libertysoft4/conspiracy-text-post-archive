        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>We have recently seen the media deepthroating and propping up former presidents (Bush and Bush senior) with the super bowl and several television appearances, their libraries and awards and honors...</p>

<p>You have to understand, they do this to some degree with ALL the former presidents after they retire. It is important to maintain the image of the US President as a courageous, and patriotic &quot;Everyman&quot;, and with all the recent stuff going on (leaks, <strong>pizzagate</strong>, 9/11 truth picking up steam), George W is in some DEEP shit, right? </p>

<p><strong>If he goes down, or if any individual president is subject to criminal trials, the whole system goes down! The president is the elites squeaky clean &quot;front man&quot;. If Bush were subjected to a federal investigation or Trial, it would really speed up the awakening process. Imagine if people found out their government did 9/11? Or that there was even a NEW investigation into it? Red pill city...</strong></p>

<p>He&#39;s wanted for war crimes in several countries. They are just going on the offensive here, trying to beat us to the punch, prop up this guys image before the Pizzagate or 9/11 stuff starts to really become a mainstream accepted belief. They need to instill a trust and allegiance to George W within the American Public, so that nobody questions his character and they will be able to blow off the accusations as &quot;hog wash&quot; or &quot;conspiracy&quot;.</p>

<p><strong>&quot;George w bush? Yea I just saw him on Ellen! I love his paintings. Now I&#39;ll admit, I never really agreed with the guys presidential policies, and he was a very radical president. But I respect him as a person, and he has a great sense of humor. I REALLY doubt that he is involved in the plotting of 9/11 sweetheart...and DEFINITELY not a child abusers ring&quot;</strong></p>

<p>That&#39;s what they want from us ^ And some people really DO think bush is like the cool grandpa or some shit...They WANT to desperately believe that. In reality, the guy is likely a sexual sadist, former drunk, and just an all around war criminal who just so happens to also be a socially awkward and disgusting person...</p>

<p>That&#39;s the whole point. And they&#39;re gonna do it with EVERYONE; Biden (the memes), Trump, Clinton, you name it. </p>

<p>I suspect they are more worried about Pizzagate and 9/11 truth breaking. Their plugs won&#39;t hold water for much longer. </p>

<p>Anyway, THATS why you&#39;re seeing presidents and politicians being frantically painted in a positive light by the media recently. fuck these clowns, keep exposing them. </p>

Called us and began talking about how Bush was painting and how it helps him meditate, and how she&#39;s going to try it now that she saw it helped him. It was insane the way they can just put ideas in our heads.

    <div class="md"><p>Also, whitewashing them is so damn easy now, with MSM&#39;s characterization of Trump. He&#39;s a mob-connected scammer, for sure, and anyone that didn&#39;t knew that was asleep the past 30 years. But right now media has pinned him as the antichrist at best, and a pee drinker at worst, and his family has the gall to order cuts so old folk will starve as they eat lobster... And the short memory and plain ignorance of the re-twiteering public does the rest, since it&#39;s the first time in &#39;merican history that scamming kleptocrats have stiffed us all. </p>

<p>Compared to the orange bucket of shit, of course grampa Bush or Barack O&#39;Drone look good. As long as you swallow the glop vomited by media.</p>

<p>All these presidents have had us bickering and fighting each other.  Because as long as we&#39;re fighting each other we&#39;re not paying attention to the global corporations using our collective resources to maintain dominance.  It&#39;s pretty hilarious to see the Trumpbots try to pretend he&#39;s somehow different just because he says so. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. The reason I think trump is so important in particular is because he is a symbol of racial divide and hate in the country. And entire political party views him And his supporters as evil people. Honestly, the stage has been set for the two sides to clash. The tension is building between the classes. They&#39;re engineering is to fight each OTHER, and not the people who are really in control. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree somewhat, but I don&#39;t think their goal is an actual widespread violent fight.  I don&#39;t see how that is useful to them.  Population control maybe, but there are more controllable ways to achieve that goal.  I think if there was anything close to a civil war it would be quickly quelled  by the media first and by martial law second.  </p>

I think pretty much the only positive impression I had was that he at least seemed to understand the ramifications of nuclear warfare and opposed his Chiefs of Staff constantly wanting to nuke everything, but even then he came off as much more of a warmonger than I&#39;d previously thought. Just coming out of school all you&#39;d think about when it came to him was his Great Society and all that...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The post was removed because of the misleading title I believe. It wasn&#39;t anything exposed by anyone, a left wing conspiracy journalist sent a random person at stratfor his article about how bush was covering up a pedo ring(it didnt even say who the recipient was, and there wasn&#39;t a reply). So it was included in leaked wikileaks emails, but nothing about that made the story more true, and his article that was pasted in the email has existed in the public eye for 10 years.</p>

<p>Also dovetailed into this bullshit is the American faux monarchy. Who the hell thinks the same family sequentially elected to the White House is at all any kind of a good idea? Why should Hillary even have been eligible to run for the presidency if she was essentially acting shadow secretary of state while her <em>husband</em> was the president? Likewise Michelle Obama. I&#39;m seeing rumblings of a M. Obama- E. Warren 2020 ticket, and people are eating that shit up. Are you fucking kidding me? We had eight fucking years of the Clintons and another eight of the Obamas. Do not try to tell me that these wives had no political input into their husband&#39;s administrations. Another four to eight years of the same family? Chelsea? Malia? What is wrong with voters? Same thing with the Bushes - at one (albeit brief) point in the last electoral process, it was lining up to be a Bush v Clinton race <strong>again</strong>. What is this shit? Keeping all the shady business in the families to minimize exposure and maximize profit? Are Americans really this stupid?</p>

We passed the biggest energy bill in the history of our country, a stimulus bill relating to refundable tax credits for poor people, a very progressive legislation.

<p>i have given up on popularity but for some reason it is still satisfying to get 5 upvotes and know i made a connection despite/in spite of the noise.</p>

<p>one day the signal to noise may get too huge....i have long thought a site needs to be created like reddit but without any commercial interest, maybe thats 4chan idk. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the adoption of the word &quot;statism&quot; could be one of the more important shifts out there. Terms like &quot;liberal&quot; have become derogatory even though very few that are labeled as such hold truly &quot;liberal&quot; views. Just as importantly, this behavior is not limited to a single group, even though it IS applied differently depending.</p>

<p>None of this is random happenstance or &quot;luck.&quot; The psychology behind these things is as basic and simple as it is powerful.</p>

<p>Associate someone like Bush with &quot;wholesome America,&quot; and those connections start to take shape <em>physically</em> whether we like it or not. Using that technique, it can be used (and has recently) to induce what is essentially mass hysteria.</p>

<p>Maybe in your circles, man, but back in October 2015 - for example - Biden&#39;s favorability among Democrats was at 85%. With adults in general it was 49%. Democrats had always viewed his favorably, but it had really begun to climb and a great many people wanted him to run for president.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your statement that a year ago reddit in general thought of Biden as a creepy pervert is false. Only two demographics have consistently loathed Joe Biden: Republicans and (to a lesser degree) conservatives. The insinuation that America at large had their opinion of Biden changed from &quot;creepy pervert&quot; to goofy uncle via memewarfare is predicated upon the false notion that the bulk of people ever considered him anything like a creepy pervert. Despite right-wing memes to the contrary, that was always the definition of a fringe notion.</p>

<p>The Joe Biden memes have existed since at least his &quot;this is a big fucking deal&quot; comment, if not before then.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There could be a lot of a reasons why many people found Biden likable or - perhaps - you&#39;ve got cause and effect partially mixed up, because even before the surge he received from that he was still very popular among most demographics and not viewed too unfavorably by any save conservatives and Republicans. Either way, though, Biden&#39;s image has not been rehabilitated by r/bidenbros - the implications, no the blatant statements this OP has made that the majority of reddit found him creepy and pervy are total bullshit, pulled out of thin are, unsubstantiated, not backed up by the data, etc. More nonsense to create the narrative that right-wing thought is popular thought, that the right-wing is the silent majority, when they&#39;re no majority at all, etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Part of the reason, in my opinion, is that it&#39;s acceptable to give in to confirmation bias when consuming media.  People will read stories and sources that espouse ideals that they share.  The whole &quot;dossier originated on 4chan&quot; bullshit is the perfect example of this.  If you read or watch any news that attempts actual journalism, then this was widely reported.

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s really strange to me how supposedly commercial channels like CNN and FOX and NBC have time for all the propaganda segments, although maybe at this point they just get more money directly from the pentagon than the could get from their shit reporting.  Actually, that&#39;s probably it.   </p>

<p>Everyone needs to learn the word &#39;hagiography&#39; and watch out for it.  It&#39;s basically the History channel&#39;s incessant WW2 coverage of Patton and Eisenhower, as if it happened yesterday.   </p>

<p>Anything that makes America look like a super great, idk, Big Brother, even if it is the weakest plotted bs in the world like American Sniper or Hurt Locker, or hammy 60 minute commercials for the Navy Seals, get 2 thumbs up, a pile of money, a bag of chips and an award. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think your analysis is overly complex.</p>

<p>Occham&#39;s Razor demands a simpler explanation.  How about this:</p>

<ol>
<li>The media has a side, generally supports whoever is &quot;more left.&quot;<br/></li>
<li>They make a lot of big stink about scandal, etc, whenever the &quot;wrong side&quot; is in power.  But they don&#39;t mean it-- it&#39;s not ethics or morals or belief, it&#39;s purely tactics.<br/></li>
<li>After the &quot;wrong side&quot; is out of power, they don&#39;t need the tactics any more, and they&#39;re removed.  New tactics may demand treating the out-of-power guy like he was a saint.</li>
</ol>

<p>The whole thing is purely marketing and advertising to reach a goal.  Ethics, morality, and belief don&#39;t even factor in.</p>

<p>Ten years ago, the &quot;left goal&quot; needed Bush to be Hitler.  Now they need Trump to be Hitler.  Previous guy is out of power so he no longer <em>needs</em> to be Hitler.  </p>

<p>Since no morals, ethics, or belief are involved, the tactics can switch to a sort of pretend objectivity to make it look like all previous guys on the &quot;other team&quot; were decent fellows, and it&#39;s only this new guy who really alarms everyone.</p>

<p>TLDR; By painting Bush as a decent fellow now, they can fool a small (but significant, I guess?) minority of people into thinking they&#39;re not crying wolf over and over again.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m late to comment on this but I had to say that the recent comments on posts which were making observations about good old W made me want to barf.</p>

<p>There was a very noticeable pattern of this type of comment &quot;Yeah, didn&#39;t really love him while he was in office but he seems like a cool guy to have a beer with....&quot;</p>

<p>If it had been once or maybe twice I wouldn&#39;t have noticed but I kept seeing it on at least a dozen or so different threads here on conspiracy.  Very suspect.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Holy shit... I was out drinking yesterday, and Someone brought up George Bush, and I said &quot;yea I don&#39;t agree with his politics, but I could have a beer with that guy&quot; but like I hate George Bush, I always have, when did I suddenly change my mind? It&#39;s like I subconsciously bought into this man sentiment change... fucking weird. </p>
