<p>Listen, Bernie Bros. I get that you&#39;re all about taking down evil wall street bankers, and evil corporations, and corruption, and finding the truth.</p>

<p>But in these comment sections there is so much Bernie praise still after he has been EXPOSED!</p>

<p>If you think the answer to the problems we have today are answered by confiscation of wealth, and just &quot;getting the right people in government&quot; will fix it. What the fuck do you think the conspiracy is? It&#39;s you.</p>

<p>They are using you to sell statism to keep you a slave. Wake the fuck up and read some Ron Paul. You think corporations aren&#39;t your friend by somehow government will be? Get over yourself.</p>

<p>You bernie bros are the biggest phonies ever buying into statist propaganda just like TPTB in all sectors of life want you to. Get real.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t have to be a fucking nut job, but look at what statism does, it kills people. Don&#39;t bring that weak ass shit about Bernie in here, that guy is a fucking fraud. </p>

It&#39;s really about recognizing that by contributing to something bigger than yourself, actually benefits yourself. Look beyond your borders. The US is kind of totally fucked so don&#39;t use that as a model to start. Cheers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Name a functioning state with a government that doesn&#39;t force it&#39;s citizens to do things, like... pay taxes, obey laws, and conform to social norms.</p>

<p>Your argument that socialism is making people do these things &quot;by force&quot; isn&#39;t incorrect, but it&#39;s disingenuous because all forms of government that currently are functioning do the same thing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why has the default position become &quot;more government is good?&quot;  I guess I envy you, in that you can place that much trust in yours.  But time and time again, in the US, we&#39;ve been shown that we can&#39;t.</p>

<p>Super basic example would be &quot;let&#39;s increase taxes by $100billion to pay for addiction treatment.&quot;  That sounds nice, and it very well might be a good idea.  Unfortunately, what ends up happening is that $100billion gets collected, and like $20billion gets spent on addiction treatment.  Pull that kind of stunt in almost every area of government, for longer than most of our parents have even been alive, and people rightfully become skeptical.  So unless/until I see <em>responsible</em> government within it&#39;s current scope, I&#39;m going to resist any increase in its power.</p>

<p>our fight isn&#39;t to stop people from disregarding their current party preference, our fight is to warn of all gov.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A form of government that ensured health of all citizens, concentrating investment and innovation on technological advancement to improve the health, well-being of people and the planet, so we can forget about being tied to a work-debt-slavery system and can spend time leisurely and spiritually evolving - whilst banishing companies such as Apple from producing a new phone with some more megapixels for $500 more, and all other capitalist money-making enterprises that provide no real benefit for humanity outside of the biggest benefit of making themselves money, To provide free healthcare to all, free effective, ecologically sustainable public transport.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m all for helping people through tough times, but socialist programs are not the answer now.  Why? Because they are being used to control people.  Soros, Omidyar, the Open Government Partnership - spout attractive ideas, suck people in with them, and then hit them with a hammer when they turn the &quot;philanthropy&quot; into  profit-generating, venture capitalism.  These people swoop in with the promise of a &quot;pretty world,&quot; and in every instance the real-life result is ugliness.  </p>

<p>The more I know about this, the more I see the gravity of what we&#39;re facing.  Interesting Jeff Rense interview with Meral, a German citizen - scary thing is the brainwashing she describes is identical to what we&#39;re facing here.  </p>

<p>That is... absurd. Corporations LOVE free markets, because they are then free from those pesky regulations. </p>

<p>And also, if you honestly think that ONLY government use force to accomplish its goals, you are incredibly naive.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Name a functioning state with a government that doesn&#39;t force it&#39;s citizens to do things, like... pay taxes, obey laws, and conform to social norms.</p>

<p>Your argument that socialism is making people do these things &quot;by force&quot; isn&#39;t incorrect, but it&#39;s disingenuous because all forms of government that currently are functioning do the same thing.</p>
