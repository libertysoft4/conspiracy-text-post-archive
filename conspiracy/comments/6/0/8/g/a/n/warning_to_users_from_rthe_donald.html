    <div class="md"><p>He&#39;s not wrong though. The &quot;United States&quot; of America was more akin to an alliance of independent states, rather than a single country. The idea was to spread power out as much as possible to avoid any sort of tyranny. With each administration we see the trend is to take away state powers and consolidate them near the top, seeding in a more and more permanent government in the deep state that runs the show. </p>

<p>What is never talked about or even taught, that the founding fathers understood, the single most important requirement for non-tyrannical societies, be they local or global, is the balance of power. Every power needs another power to impede them or else they end up with total world control. And as idealistic as it may be to hope that these world rulers are benevolent, nothing about human history has suggested anything but the most sociopathic making it into the high reaches of power. Even if they are good rulers there, it is only a matter of time before someone takes them out or replaces them that are corrupt or incompetent enough to be manipulated. Even the wicked don&#39;t stand to benefit from total power as they live with targets on their backs even among their own, and will have to relinquish their power to someone with different ideals.</p>

<p>Therefore the single most important role you can have as a citizen of Earth is to act in a way as to maintain the balance or power and deter its concentration.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most posts there are anti-Trump, but that&#39;s only because it&#39;s mainly liberal. It&#39;s good to see the viewpoint of the left, but if you look (deep, past the top comments which aren&#39;t usually that amazing) in the comments there is some good conversation. Of course, conservative opinions are more likely to be downvoted, but I&#39;ve seen some great exchanges.</p>

<p>T_D is much more of an echo chamber because they destroy opposition, politics just drowns it out and down votes you. The effect is essentially the same though however - you have to get other portions of your news elsewhere. The main difference between T_D and politics is style of oppression.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem with being one-sided is that it leaves a vacuum, no place with such a wide-reach for Trump supporters to freely discuss and critique policy. 
Recently, I noticed any comments against the administration&#39;s potential policing of marijuana seemed to quickly disappear on r/ TD. I&#39;ve also read speculation that Trump&#39;s team may actually view the Donald sub to gauge public opinion. Well, with the increased removal of honest critique and dissenting views, his team won&#39;t find a true measure of what supporters think. One can support Trump and also be critical of some of his policy decisions. 
I&#39;ve been disappointed to see that sub turning into an echo chamber. </p>

<p>I made a post in T_D right before the election that said if Trump doesn&#39;t follow through and actually drain the swamp that he would be a political hack in my mind - and I got outright banned (&quot;deported&quot;) for that one. I appealed it and they let me back in - but there isn&#39;t any room for it. They do it because everywhere else is a battle  ground. Ironically, its a safe space for them.</p>

<p>That said, r/ask_TheDonald is open to questions and conversation about his policies, but I imagine far fewer people go there.</p>

Sure that means they need to put in a bit of effort. BUT that&#39;s the point isn&#39;t it, if you are the mods of such a big subreddit, that comes with some responsibility. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think Trump marketed himself as such but none of his actions or even campaign promises are outside of the old  paradigm.  His campaign platform from the wall to repeal of Obamacare/ACA are pure GOP platform ideas. The wall got its start with WH Bush and section were built long before him.  Repeal Obamacare, again the GOP has been trying for the past 7 years.  I am not seeing anything outside of the ideas that have already existed for a long time in both parties. Even his cabinet/admin picks, while some are out of the ordinary they still are all in line with the GOP and tea party platform.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. I&#39;ve noticed a considerable downgrade in the_d. One of the very first posts I made once Trump got elected was to please continue the inclusive attitude shown during the election (back when they were considered scrappy underdogs and welcomed pretty much everyone). Now it&#39;s back to being binary and I have no doubt there&#39;s an agenda. That said, it&#39;s still a very useful sub because people there are red-pilled more than most... especially <a href="/r/redacted">/r/redacted</a> which is entirely corporatized at this point. </p>

<p>And what is up with the &quot;Islam is a cancer&quot; shit? I&#39;m all for more stringent immigration and a complete overhaul, but ISIS is a tool used by our own damn government. WE are the ones fomenting radicalization (or at least capitalizing on) an otherwise normal religion for political purposes. There are of course more primitive sects of the religion doing stupid shit like stoning, but if it was inherently violent, the world would be in massive trouble given its followers totaling in the billion.  </p>

<p>I see the &quot;hate Islam&quot; as one such useful tool being deployed by whoever is modding the place. If they&#39;re pro-Israel zionists then I&#39;m not at all surprised.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just wanted to add to the conversation that the_donald is usually one of my stops from the front page, through the news/world news, politics, Hillary Clinton and Hillary Clinton for Prison and then finally this sub before shutting it down.  Anyway, interesting that recently the_donalds front page has been showing a lot of anti-bernie Sanders articles.  Kinda ironic considering I don&#39;t see Trump having won without a ton of Bernie  supporters citing for Trump in the end.  Idk if they are trying to win over the Bernie Bros by proping up Donny as the true people&#39;s champ or what, but it really comes off as rather divisive and probably counter productive to any hope of Donny getting re-elected.  To be honest my grasp of politics is rather rudimentary so who knows.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, he completely sold us out and he had some very peculiar flaws even before that occurred. His primary flaw being that, even while trying to appeal primarily to progressives, he virtually never spoke out against the military invasions or the military budget (even though those are, by far, our most serious problems). In fact, he even talked about getting other countries in the region involved in the invasion so that the U.S. isn&#39;t doing everything on its own, which, as you may be aware, had been the plan of the CIA/Pentagon for years.<br/>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not about money printing or trade deals.  That&#39;s sort of kind of a dispute between American centric globalists and European centric globalists.</p>

<p>Around 1900, big businesses started using government regulations to suppress competition and guarantee their wealth to a degree.  If they hadn&#39;t, we&#39;d have seen a sort of retro futuristic world like Ayn Rand&#39;s by the 40s.  The industrial revolution ended when competition and thus entrepreneurship that affected big business ended.</p>

<p>Business now is a political enterprise.  It&#39;s about who you know and what you say and do that gets you access to resources.  For example, homesteading rules and the ability to sue polluters who pollute other private property would be enough to manage oil in the free market.  Instead we have an almost communism where the government mandates where and when oil can be drilled.  Only a few certain companies are approved to refine oil in certain licensed refineries.  It&#39;s New Deal goddamn American economic fascism.  Telling businesses and consumers what they can or can&#39;t sell and managing - not regulating - big important consequential industries.  Little ma and pa companies still have relative freedom.  But energy, agriculture, transportation, healthcare - yeah not even close to a free market.  America is more than we admit a socialist shithole in ways.</p>

<p>The Fed enables this.  There used to be 30 some odd banks in America 8 years ago and now there are like 4 major ones left.  Want a lot of money to open a multi-hundred million dollar thing which will be economically consequential?  What an environmental approval?  Want that healthcare law waiver so you can afford you employee health benefits program?  Better fucking hire SJWs for your Har department.  That&#39;s the game.</p>

<p>The real politics in America occurs in smokey back rooms, and elections are a joke.  I thought Trump represented some exception to this.  Nope.  His Bannon/Breitbart bullshit about America&#39;s military and factories going back to 1955 is hardcore bullshit.  1955 America was <em>better</em> than the New Deal, but it was 66% of the way to the New Deal from 1922, and was a military corruption money wasting powerhouse.</p>

<p>Nothing has been taken from &quot;them&quot;.  Trump is begging Yellen to keep the pumps flowing so the economy doesn&#39;t collapse before 2020.  Good luck.</p>

<p>My hope was that Trump would expose the true nature of the American system which is the necessary first step to real change.  But he&#39;s not going to do that.  Hillary won&#39;t ever go to jail.  It&#39;s a joke.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>The conspiracy side of me believes that some big movers inside reddit have been able to infiltrate that sub  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;d say that&#39;s likely the case. There&#39;s a lot of psychology and precision involved in the current effort. It&#39;s like a branch of the CIA showed up; the branch that&#39;s in charge of perpetuating the left-vs-right bullshit through the generations.  </p>

<p>And yeah, the main things being pushed are the usual we see every decade:   </p>

<ul>
<li>Hate &#39;muslims&#39;<br/></li>
<li>Hate &#39;liberals&#39;<br/></li>
<li>Love gas guzzling vehicles &amp; guns<br/></li>
<li>Love football &amp; Jesus<br/></li>
<li>Worship police and military<br/></li>
<li>Praise capitalism and corporations<br/></li>
<li>Focus heavily on a person&#39;s physical appearance<br/></li>
</ul>

<p>It may appear as though I&#39;m just describing a stereotypical &#39;Republican&#39;. That&#39;s because I am. These shills are trying to make Trump supports believe that, because they supported someone who just happens to have run under the Republican banner, they must now adopt all these &#39;Republican&#39; stereotypes. The shills are trying to  turns the &#39;alt-right&#39; (a diverse bunch that includes many independent thinkers) in the classic, stereotypical &#39;Republican&#39; because that&#39;s what they need to continue to use the left-vs-right, divide &amp; conquer play book they&#39;ve been using for decades.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well based off what you have said I could also say the same for <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. Anyone who uses logic and common sense are down voted or comments get deleted that support Trump in this case depending on the situation, but as I have said criticize him when it is warranted, but not if it is unnecessary. This entire post could also be said as the same as you suggested as divide and conquer mentality. Telling people that moderators on another subreddit are &quot;shills&quot; and try to use logic thinking, but to dumb down others to believe a different point of view just because, but I am taking it as you suggested it can be seen both ways.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The_Donald is for Trump supporters, what&#39;s wrong with that?</p>

<p>It&#39;s great to have a moderated forum for purely pro-Trump messages. You think Trump supporters don&#39;t get out to other forums?</p>

<p>It&#39;s a home base, and most certainly should be a protected space for Trump supporters. If you want debate, go to AskTrumpSupporters.</p>

<p>What a stupid &quot;warning&quot;. Where is your outrage over forums that actually should be open for fair debate, politics, news, etc.</p>

<p>Why not issue a warning to the StarWars forums, attention!! Star Trek fans aren&#39;t welcome.</p>

<p>Your logic is terrible, and your shill ad hominems are nothing more than projection.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because Trump supporters elected Trump for certain reasons and would stop being Trump supporters if those reasons don&#39;t get fulfilled.  The T_D mods are shaping the discussion to keep that from happening.  Outside of T_D, Trump is cancer and can&#39;t be discussed sincerely.  So by framing discussion within T_D to certain issues, you can have &quot;two&quot; sides to an issue but no meaningful debate. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Diverse minds?  They call their sub a 24/7 campaign rally for Trump and if you criticize anything Trump does you can get banned.  You can be diverse in the way you attack other politicians but if you criticize Trunp you are outta there... even mild criticism.. people got banned for asking about Trump&#39;s connection to Betsy Devos&#39;s brother (blackwater founder) and how that seems likely to be the reason he picked her for Education.  Go over there and ask how appointing Mitch McConnell&#39;s wife to a cabinet position helps &quot;drain the swamp.&quot;  You&#39;ll be banned.  The sub was designed to be a circlejerk.  It wasn&#39;t designed to be a 2-sided conversation or a free marketplace of ideas.  Go there to praise kek, blow everything Trump does and share memes.  Don&#39;t go there to question the dear leader or have an honest discussion about whether or not Trump is draining the swamp.  The people who post there regularly have no interest in holding Trump accountable.  They are just there to justify anything he does.  It&#39;s like divine command... something you might not agree with or like if a different politician did it suddenly becomes good when Trump does it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I at least can handle an echo chamber that openly expresses itself as such. The liberal reddit groups seem more like wolves in sheep skins. The Donald is a farce that is openly believed in and it pisses the liberals off. It used to be a glorious echo chamber that touted itself as such. If that is the case, then what are you guys complaining about??? Of course you got banned because you assumed it was a regular political reddit. In their ridiculous antics at least there is a modicum of truth in the lie... liberals believe they never lie and think they are proclaiming truth.</p>
