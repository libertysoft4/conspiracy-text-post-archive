        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">9</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2017-03-19 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/andywarhaul.html">andywarhaul</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I was at the dentist the other day and I decided to ask my dentist about their opinion on fluoride in drinking water. </p>

<p>A couple things to know, they are from China a country that does not fluoridate their drinking water, but they are now working in Canada a country with selective fluoridation depending on a municipalities choice. Their first job in dentistry in Canada was in a large centre where the water was fluoridated and now works in a small community where the water is fluoride free.</p>

<p>They said that for anyone except small children and possibly the elderly there isn&#39;t any benefit from having fluoride in the drinking water. The reasoning being that children will absorb the fluoride into their teeth because their adult teeth are in development and will benefit from having the fluoride absorbed into them. I don&#39;t know how legit that is and I&#39;m not claiming it be the 100% accurate truth but that&#39;s just what they told me. They also went on to say that however with fluoride in the water you have to worry about the amount of water the child is drinking because they may develop <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_fluorosis">Fluorosis</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Many well-known sources of fluoride may contribute to overexposure including dentifrice/fluoridated mouthrinse (which young children may swallow), excessive ingestion of fluoride toothpaste, bottled waters which are not tested for their fluoride content, inappropriate use of fluoride supplements, ingestion of foods especially imported from other countries, <strong>and public water fluoridation.[13] The last of these sources is directly or indirectly responsible for 40% of all fluorosis</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>So they say that fluorosis is mostly aesthetic but in moderate to severe cases there is physical damage to the teeth. My question would be is what amount of fluoride is needed to be ingested to get fluorosis? Because it&#39;s happening from just drinking water. And then does that amount of fluoride being ingested raise concerns based off of this report which classifies fluoride as a neurotoxin? <a href="http://www.thelancet.com/journals/laneur/article/PIIS1474-4422(13)70278-3/fulltext#article_upsell">http://www.thelancet.com/journals/laneur/article/PIIS1474-4422(13)70278-3/fulltext#article_upsell</a></p>

<p>The dentist did say that they see more cavities in their new smaller community that doesn&#39;t fluoridate the water. But is that worth it if we&#39;re not exposing people to a potentially harmful neurotoxin? Surely there&#39;s other ways to improve oral hygiene that would limit expose to fluoride for everyone, especially considering that adults have no benefit from fluoride in drinking water. </p>

<p>What I took away from their remarks was that they saw fluoride in the water as a positive because it causes less cavities in kids but that they didn&#39;t see a reason for adults to be drinking the same water. They also made the point of <em>watching a child&#39;s water intake</em> when drinking from a fluoridated source. That just really blew me away. I don&#39;t think anybody considers how much water their kid is drinking. </p>

<p>Just my thoughts on the topic I know it&#39;s been popular here before so I just thought to ask. </p>

<p>You reject referenced material, get basic physics wrong, and then claim to hold an MA in physics. Look at this link:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.industrialheating.com/ext/resources/IH/Home/Files/PDFs/Raytek%20White%20Paper.pdf">http://www.industrialheating.com/ext/resources/IH/Home/Files/PDFs/Raytek%20White%20Paper.pdf</a></p>

<p>Where it tells you:</p>

<ul>
<li>&quot;This ability is based on Planck’s Law of black body radiation that states every object emits radiant energy, and the intensity of this radiation is a function of the object&#39;s temperature.&quot;</li>
</ul>

<p>Or this: <a href="http://www.tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca/biens-property/sngp-npms/bi-rp/tech/ir-eng.html">http://www.tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca/biens-property/sngp-npms/bi-rp/tech/ir-eng.html</a></p>

<ul>
<li>&quot;Even very cold objects, like ice cubes, emit energy in the infrared spectrum. The higher the object&#39;s temperature, the greater the IR radiation emitted.&quot;</li>
</ul>

<p>How would <a href="/u/CuriousAbout_Physics">/u/CuriousAbout_Physics</a>&#39; account being created shortly after some other account&#39;s suspension link those accounts to me? Wouldn&#39;t you have to prove that some account was created after <em>my</em> account was suspended? But my account has never been suspended. So what links any of these accounts to me?

<li>&quot;Because of its dependence on temperature, Planck radiation is said to be thermal radiation. The higher the temperature of a body the more radiation it emits at every wavelength. Planck radiation has a maximum intensity at a specific wavelength that depends on the temperature. &quot;</li>

<blockquote>
<p>All bodies with any temperature will emit photons at <em>every</em> frequency, but <strong>bodies at higher temperatures will emit more photons at certain frequencies</strong>, compared to others (<strong>the peak of the curve shifts</strong>). However, <strong>even though the peak shifts toward higher frequencies at higher temperatures</strong>, more photons are emitted at <em>any</em> given frequency as well, compared to when the temperature was cooler. Take a look at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck&#x27;s_law">Planck function</a>, which shows that as temperature increases, the value of the function increases for <em>all</em> frequencies. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, I include a link to Wikipedia, which supports exactly what I said. By the way, it&#39;s funny how you claim that I don&#39;t provide references and then one sentence later you talk about how I referenced Planck&#39;s law. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t see how anyone could possible interpret what I said above as &quot;insisting that cool objects emit the same radiation as warm ones,&quot; but maybe that just because I understand blackbody radiation and you don&#39;t. Again, all bodies with temperature emit at all frequencies, but <em>how many photons</em> they emit at each frequency is different. You replied, saying the following: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>So an ice-cube emits the same range of IR as the sun? Since IR is heat both would be same temperature.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not only are you incredulous about the facts of blackbody radiation, but you also volunteer that you believe that heat and infrared are the same thing, something that a child might believe until it is debunked in middle school. I replied:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yes, both objects emit at all IR frequencies. The Sun emits <em>way more</em> photons at every frequency and peaks in visible frequencies. A black body at the temperature of an ice cube would emit <em>way fewer</em> photons and would peak in the near to mid infrared.</p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/pzk2ect">Here</a> is a plot I made for you that shows the two Planck curves. The ice is shown in blue (273.15 K) and the Sun is in yellow (5777 K). It was hard to see both curves on a plot like this, so I have scaled up the blue curve. It is important to note that neither object is a <em>perfect</em> black body, but stars (like the Sun), for example, are very well approximated by black bodies.</p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/gIpOg1y">Here</a> is another plot I made, this time plotted on a log scale (the blue curve is no longer scaled up here), which better illustrates that both of these bodies emit across the <em>entire</em> infrared spectrum (plotted here is 700 nm and longer wavelengths).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Claiming that I&#39;m wrong about the behavior of the Planck function is ridiculous. I&#39;ve <em>plotted it</em> for you. Are you going to claim that these plots are wrong too?</p>

<p>Again, the <em>number of photons</em> emitted depends on temperature, not whether or not photons of a given frequency are emitted. Photons are emitted at all frequencies in varying amounts for any body with nonzero temperature. This is one of the first things that anybody learns about blackbody radiation in their first thermodynamics course. </p>

<p>The <em>number of photons</em> emitted in a given frequency band is dependent on temperature, but a cool object does not all of a sudden <em>stop emitting</em> in the infrared, like you have claimed over and over again on Reddit. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Your trying to split hairs does nothing to refute that.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Every time I prove you wrong you come back with this argument that I&#39;m splitting hairs. It is not splitting hairs to plot the blackbody curve for an ice cube to show that it <em>does</em> emit across the entire infrared portion of the spectrum, completely contrary to your claim. </p>

It seems that rather than actually respond to my points, you are just resorting to copying and pasting things now. I would like my questions answered:</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s because any body with nonzero temperature <em>does</em> emit photons at all IR frequencies. A cooler body will emit fewer photons at these frequencies than a warmer one, but neither of these bodies will emit identically zero radiation at these frequencies. You seem to not understand the difference between width of a frequency band and number of photons emitted within a frequency band.</p>

<p>Like I said before, all you have to do is plug a frequency and temperature into the Planck function. Unless the number you get out is zero (not just very small, but <em>identically</em> zero), then you will have emission at that frequency. You can&#39;t argue with the Planck function. Do you know how to use it?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>None of you people can supply a reference refuting any of that. So, I win, and you lose.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why would anybody try to refute any of that? Nothing you&#39;ve quoted there is incorrect, and it&#39;s totally in agreement with what I have explained to you for days now, across two different subreddits. </p>

<p>If you would like to try to prove your understanding of blackbody radiation, please answer this:</p>

<p>Consider an ice cube at 273 K and the Sun at 5777 K. How many photons per second does the Sun emit at 10,000 nm? How many does the ice cube emit? How much more total power per unit area is radiated by the Sun across <em>all</em> frequencies than is radiated by the ice cube?</p>

<p><strong>Are you capable of answering these questions? Do you even know where to begin?</strong> Each question should only take a few seconds to answer, if you know anything about this topic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are claiming that a cooler object will not emit certain frequencies that a warm one will emit. </p>

<p>Here is a quotation from the Wikipedia page for thermography supporting my claim that any body with nonzero temperature emits photons at all IR frequencies:</p>

<p>&quot;<strong>Since infrared radiation is emitted by all objects with a temperature above absolute zero according to the black body radiation law</strong>, thermography makes it possible to see one&#39;s environment with or without visible illumination.&quot;</p>

<p>At this point, if you are going to continue to argue, you should try to do one of the following things:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Try to find a quotation that supports your claim that the above Wikipedia quotation is not true. </p></li>
<li><p>Try to plug a temperature and an IR frequency into the Planck function to show that you can get an answer that is <em>identically zero</em>. </p></li>
<li><p>Plot the Planck function for a body of any temperature (vs either wavelength or frequency) and try to find where that plot hits the horizontal axis. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>If you can&#39;t demonstrate that your claim is true, then why continue to make that claim? I have demonstrated that an ice cube will emit across the entire IR spectrum by <strong>plotting it for you</strong>. How are you going to continue to deny this when I have already showed you a plot illustrates that you are wrong?</p>

<p>Additionally, if you are so sure of yourself, despite all of the evidence that shows you are wrong, then feel free to ask about this in <a href="/r/AskPhysics">/r/AskPhysics</a>. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Haha you don&#39;t know how to calculate it. I actually <em>do</em> know how to calculate it, because I actually <em>understand</em> blackbody radiation.

<p><em>Consider an ice cube at 273 K and the Sun at 5777 K.</em></p>

<p><em>1. How many photons per second does the Sun emit at 10,000 nm?</em></p>

<p><em>2. How many does the ice cube emit?</em></p>

<p><em>3. How much more total power per unit area is radiated by the Sun across all frequencies than is radiated by the ice cube?</em></p>

<p><strong>Are you capable of answering these questions? Do you even know where to begin?</strong> Each question should only take a few seconds to answer, if you know anything about this topic. </p>

<p>If you are unable to answer these questions (like you were unable to answer my <a href="http://archive.is/7CVSb">climate-related questions</a>), then I would be happy to type up the solutions for you (like the <a href="http://docdro.id/bstidUI">solutions</a> I typed up for the climate-related questions you couldn&#39;t answer). </p>

<p>You can&#39;t. </p>

<p>You said that you didn&#39;t want to talk about &quot;stray photons&quot; that were emitted around once a minute. I asked if you believed that a 273-K object would emit only around one photon per minute in certain infrared frequencies. <strong>You admitted that you don&#39;t know</strong>. </p>

<p>How do you not know, Bunnies? You claimed to understand blackbody radiation. Shouldn&#39;t you know how to calculate the number of photons emitted by a blackbody at a given frequency? </p>

<p>Wikipedia&#39;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermography">thermography</a> page:</p>

<p>&quot;Since infrared radiation is emitted by all objects with a temperature above absolute zero according to the black body radiation law...&quot;</p>

<p>Wikipedia&#39;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-body_radiation">blackbody radiation</a> page:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>These are the sources I&#39;ve listed. Tell us why each is wrong:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They aren&#39;t wrong. Those are basic facts about blackbody radiation. They have nothing to do with the claim you made. <strong>You said that a &quot;cool object&quot; will not emit the same IR frequencies as a &quot;warm object,&quot;</strong> as if there is some kind of cut-off frequency, where the Planck function is <em>identically zero</em>. <strong>You have not been able to provide any reference which claims that</strong>. <em>None</em> of the things you have quoted claim that. </p>

<p>Continuing to copy and paste correct statements unrelated to your claim and asking people to refute them is nothing more than a distraction, since you know that your claims about blackbody radiation are wrong. If you really believed your claims, then you would find a source that <em>actually addresses what you&#39;ve said</em>, or you would use the Planck function to either plot a black body curve or calculate the IR emission of a given body, to show that there is zero emission somewhere in the IR, like you have claimed. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>You can&#39;t provide even one source refuting Planck&#39;s law.</p>

<p>No, because Planck&#39;s law is correct. I have provided two sources above that refute your <em>incorrect</em> claims about Planck&#39;s law though (that a &quot;cool object&quot; will not emit the same IR frequencies as a &quot;warm object&quot;). I have also plotted blackbody curves for you, showing you that they are not zero anywhere. Your continued denial of this is embarrassing. </p>

<p>I explained this <em>to you</em> in <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/607ytu/comment/df7rz4b?st=J1EXBAWO&amp;amp;sh=18931947">this comment</a>:</p>

<p>&quot;All bodies with any temperature will emit photons at <em>every</em> frequency, but bodies at higher temperatures will emit <em>more</em> photons at certain frequencies, compared to others (the peak of the curve shifts). However, even though the peak shifts toward higher frequencies at higher temperatures, more photons are emitted at <em>any</em> given frequency as well, compared to when the temperature was cooler. Take a look at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck&#x27;s_law">Planck function</a>, which shows that as temperature increases, the value of the function increases for <em>all</em> frequencies.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Game, set, and match for me.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure how you think this is &quot;game, set, and match&quot; for you. I have already explained all of this to you weeks ago. You are literally quoting articles that agree with what I have explained to you about blackbody radiation in an attempt to discredit me haha. </p>

<p>If you are trying to demonstrate that you understand blackbody radiation, then you are doing a pretty horrible job. If you&#39;d like to try to redeem yourself, then you should answer the following questions, to show that you know how to use the Planck function. </p>

<p><em>Consider an ice cube at 273 K and the Sun at 5777 K.</em></p>

<p><em>1. How many photons per second does the Sun emit at 10,000 nm?</em></p>

<p><em>2. How many does the ice cube emit?</em></p>

<p><em>3. How much more total power per unit area is radiated by the Sun across all frequencies than is radiated by the ice cube?</em></p>

<p><strong>Are you capable of answering these questions? Do you even know where to begin?</strong> Each question should only take a few seconds to answer, if you know anything about this topic. </p>

<p>If you are unable to answer these questions (like you were unable to answer my <a href="http://archive.is/7CVSb">climate-related questions</a>), then I would be happy to type up the solutions for you (like the <a href="http://docdro.id/bstidUI">solutions</a> I typed up for the climate-related questions you couldn&#39;t answer). </p>

<p>I provide references for everything, you do not. You insist that cool objects emit the same radiation as warm ones. You even referred to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck%27s_law">Planck&#39;s Law</a> without having looked it up to make sure it says what he thinks it says. It doesn&#39;t:</p>

<ul>

<blockquote>
<p>All bodies with any temperature will emit photons at <em>every</em> frequency, but <strong>bodies at higher temperatures will emit more photons at certain frequencies</strong>, compared to others (<strong>the peak of the curve shifts</strong>). However, <strong>even though the peak shifts toward higher frequencies at higher temperatures</strong>, more photons are emitted at <em>any</em> given frequency as well, compared to when the temperature was cooler. Take a look at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck&#x27;s_law">Planck function</a>, which shows that as temperature increases, the value of the function increases for <em>all</em> frequencies. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, I include a link to Wikipedia, which supports exactly what I said. By the way, it&#39;s funny how you claim that I don&#39;t provide references and then one sentence later you talk about how I referenced Planck&#39;s law. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t see how anyone could possible interpret what I said above as &quot;insisting that cool objects emit the same radiation as warm ones,&quot; but maybe that just because I understand blackbody radiation and you don&#39;t. Again, all bodies with temperature emit at all frequencies, but <em>how many photons</em> they emit at each frequency is different. You replied, saying the following: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>So an ice-cube emits the same range of IR as the sun? Since IR is heat both would be same temperature.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not only are you incredulous about the facts of blackbody radiation, but you also volunteer that you believe that heat and infrared are the same thing, something that a child might believe until it is debunked in middle school. I replied:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yes, both objects emit at all IR frequencies. The Sun emits <em>way more</em> photons at every frequency and peaks in visible frequencies. A black body at the temperature of an ice cube would emit <em>way fewer</em> photons and would peak in the near to mid infrared.</p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/pzk2ect">Here</a> is a plot I made for you that shows the two Planck curves. The ice is shown in blue (273.15 K) and the Sun is in yellow (5777 K). It was hard to see both curves on a plot like this, so I have scaled up the blue curve. It is important to note that neither object is a <em>perfect</em> black body, but stars (like the Sun), for example, are very well approximated by black bodies.</p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/gIpOg1y">Here</a> is another plot I made, this time plotted on a log scale (the blue curve is no longer scaled up here), which better illustrates that both of these bodies emit across the <em>entire</em> infrared spectrum (plotted here is 700 nm and longer wavelengths).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Claiming that I&#39;m wrong about the behavior of the Planck function is ridiculous. I&#39;ve <em>plotted it</em> for you. Are you going to claim that these plots are wrong too?</p>

<p>What you are saying here flies in the face of the Planck function. Plug any temperature and frequency into that equation and you will get a nonzero value out. Did you not know how to use this function?</p>

</blockquote>

<p>From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-body_radiation">Wikipedia</a>: &quot;<strong>A black body radiates energy at all frequencies</strong>, but its intensity rapidly tends to zero at high frequencies (short wavelengths). For example, a black body at room temperature (300 K) with one square meter of surface area will emit a photon in the visible range (390–750 nm) at an average rate of one photon every 41 seconds, meaning that for most practical purposes, such a black body does not emit in the visible range.&quot;</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t trust Wikipedia, then learn how to use the Planck function and plug in the numbers for yourself. Like I said, if you plug any temperature and frequency into that equation, you will get a nonzero value out. What does that tell you?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yes, IR is heat. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, IR is not heat. IR stands for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared">infrared</a>, which is a portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat">Heat</a> is something entirely different. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>As are visible light. <em>[sic]</em> X-rays, and gamma. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, neither of these are heat either. Again, these are just portions of the electromagnetic spectrum. Read the Wikipedia page on heat that I have linked above.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Heat is why molecules emit radiation. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yet again, this is wrong. Heat can <em>flow</em> via radiation, but also by conduction or convection. <em>Temperature</em> is what dictates how a black body will emit radiation, but temperature and heat are not the same thing. Molecules emit radiation for many different reasons. When a molecule is in an excited state and jumps back down to a less excited state (like the ground state, for example), then it will emit a photon. Read <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emission_spectrum">this Wikipedia page</a> for more information.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>See the definition of &quot;absolute zero&quot; for more information. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_zero">Wikipedia</a>: &quot;Absolute zero is the lower limit of the thermodynamic temperature scale, a state at which the enthalpy and entropy of a cooled ideal gas reaches its minimum value, taken as 0.&quot; In what way do you believe this supports your argument?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do you still expect people to believe that you hold an MA in physics?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t really care what people believe about my credentials. I showed you that I have <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/science/comments/5ivw50/do_you_have_a_college_degree_or_higher_in_science/dbrmvd9/?">flair</a> on <a href="/r/science">/r/science</a>, verifying that I am a PhD student in astrophysics, but you still don&#39;t accept this. What I <em>do</em> care about is that you are trying to spread misinformation and refusing to accept evidence.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On your bullshit image you have the sun cooler than ice. Way to go.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Sun is not cooler than ice in either of those plots. Would you care to share why you think this is the case? If you answer only one thing from this comment (it would be nice if you would answer all of it, but you fail to do that sometimes), then I ask that you please answer this one. I would like to know why you think the plots I have made for you show that the Sun is cooler than ice.</p>

<p>You didn&#39;t believe that certain objects (like ice cubes) would emit at all in certain portions of the electromagnetic spectrum that other objects (like the Sun) do.

<p>Both objects emit many photons per second across the infrared portion of the spectrum. To claim otherwise is incorrect. Again, I <a href="http://m.imgur.com/a/1Q67X">plotted</a> their blackbody curves for you. Plot them yourself! <strong>Do you know how?</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck%27s_law">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck%27s_law</a></p>

<p>Note the passage in the Introduction:</p>

<ul>
<li>&quot;Because of its dependence on temperature, Planck radiation is said to be thermal radiation. The higher the temperature of a body the more radiation it emits at every wavelength. Planck radiation has a maximum intensity at a specific wavelength that depends on the temperature.&quot;</li>

<ul>
<li>&quot;This ability is based on Planck’s Law of black body radiation that states every object emits radiant energy, and the intensity of this radiation is a function of the object&#39;s temperature.&quot;</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>&quot;Even very cold objects, like ice cubes, emit energy in the infrared spectrum. The higher the object&#39;s temperature, the greater the IR radiation emitted.&quot;</li>

<p>I have a proposition for you: pose a question about this to <a href="/r/AskPhysics">/r/AskPhysics</a>. Ask them whether the Planck function says that a body of nonzero temperature emits across <em>all</em> frequencies. Ask whether an ice cube and the Sun both emit across <em>all</em> of the IR portion of the spectrum. </p>

<p>If you are so confident that you are right about this, then you should have no problem asking people to confirm who is right. </p>

<p>Bunnies claims that some black bodies will emit <strong>zero radiation</strong> in certain parts of the infrared. Bunnies was incredulous about the fact that an ice cube would emit photons across the entire IR portion of the spectrum just like the Sun does (even though the Sun emits way more of them). Read the rest of this thread for more context. I have <a href="http://imgur.com/a/1Q67X">plotted</a> the blackbody curves for bodies at 273 K (the temperature of ice) and 5777 K (the temperature of the surface of the Sun), and I have shown that neither curve crosses the horizontal axis at any frequency (the log plot illustrates this best), yet Bunnies is still in denial of this. Bunnies is now quoting bits from Wikipedia that do not claim what Bunnies is claiming, yet Bunnies thinks they do. I would like to know your thoughts on this.</p>

<p>Your references actually say what I&#39;ve been saying, and say nothing about <em>zero emission</em> at certain frequencies, which is what you are claiming. Posting links and quotations that don&#39;t even address your claim is not &quot;backing you up.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Isn&#39;t this what children say? I&#39;m more interested in evidence. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve shown you that a black body at the temperature of ice (273 K) emits radiation across the entire IR spectrum by plotting the Planck function (see my comment above). You have chosen to deny this evidence. In response, I asked you to plot a blackbody curve yourself in order to attempt to demonstrate your claim certain body will emit <em>zero radiation</em> in certain bands, depending on their temperature. If there is even <em>one</em> part of a properly plotted Planck function that crosses the horizontal axis, then I would tell you that you are right and I am wrong. You just have to show <em>one</em> part of a blackbody curve crossing the horizontal axis. </p>

<p>Why would you not attempt this? I don&#39;t think you know how to use the Planck function, but rather than just admit you don&#39;t understand, you continue to change the subject and claim that you&#39;ve won haha.</p>

<p>Oh, so now you agree with me? And I only had to explain it to you 30 times! Wow, you&#39;re getting better at admitting you&#39;re wrong, Bunnies! </p>

<p>This does, however, leave me with the question... how do I lose, exactly? You are now agreeing with me that any black body at any nonzero temperature will emit a nonzero amount in all frequencies. Doesn&#39;t that mean I win, since this is what I have been explaining to you for days now? You seem to be contradicting yourself here. </p>

<p>Anyway, thanks for admitting that you have been wrong about this. It&#39;s good to see that you&#39;re capable of accepting overwhelming evidence, even though it is preceded by several days of denial. </p>

<p>I do. And just as a single data point. A good Reverse Osmosis filter will remove fluoride from drinking water. We told our kids dentist that we RO our water and he kept warning us about potential cavities for the kids with unfluoridated water.
