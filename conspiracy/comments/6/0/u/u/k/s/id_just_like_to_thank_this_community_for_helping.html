    <div class="md"><p>Has anyone confirmed that the North and South shafts <em>actually</em> faced the North Star and the Orion belt when the pyramids were first built? IIRC they no longer line up with any stars.</p>

<p>I have also read the explanation that they were air vents.</p>

<p>And I remember reading that the pyramids were potentially used by extra-terrestrials to make fuel as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m still making my way through it, but the events leading up to the war are basically entirely different from what we have been lead to believe. One of the most surprising things so far was the fact that before the war, Hitler actually made a deal with the Jewish leaders to move them to Palestine. Another one was that he offered Britain two dozen peace treaties after he invaded France and was clearly winning the war after pushing them across the English canal, but the British did not accept any of the offers. The whole motivation for every one of his attacks was basically a response to what the other European countries were doing to the German people. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just watched it and although you weren&#39;t referring to the docs I thought you were originally--I&#39;m glad that was the case and you sent me that link directly giving me that little push to actually watch what I probably wouldn&#39;t have otherwise. Completely convincing and I don&#39;t even know what to say. Man can go faster than the speed of light apparently and do so without a local sense of acceleration or inertia or being turned inside out and jostled like a paint mixer. NASA is still a ridiculous farce of course but I suppose that&#39;s the point. Anyway thanks!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I still remember the visceral shock I felt when I stumbled onto the fact of that first big disclosure project press conference... I couldn&#39;t believe what I was seeing had happened just a few years before the time I found out about it and somehow I hadn&#39;t heard a thing about it happening when it happened... why wasn&#39;t there stunned people on every channel with talking heads not talking just sputtering and asking each other whether or not they&#39;d just seen what they&#39;d just seen... would it even be possible to fake that many whistle blowers like that? I mean, those were dozens of real people with real verifiable lives and careers that matched their claims and I couldn&#39;t imagine that kind of organization it would have taken to plan and orchestrate such a tapestry of ordinary folks with disparate personalities and roles but similar stories clearly all describing their section of the same &#39;elephant&#39; so to speak... they spent at least 3-or-4 years setting up and playing out the whole Sndy Hook Hoax and that was ham-handed as hell. But that press conference was as genuine and authentic-seeming as only reality ever is. Shocking as it was, I couldn&#39;t consider it anything other than generally genuine. </p>

<p>Convincing anyone I knew to so much as give me 5 minutes of their attention to show them what I was talking about though... now that was an unlikely event and ultimately impossible task. Definitely knew one thing--I had to get rid of such idiot friends and families who created world views that absolutely wouldn&#39;t allow for anything unusual ever occurring no matter how long they had to walk around with their hands covering their eyes telling themselves &#39;nothing to see here folks just keep walking and we&#39;ll get to the water cooler and the fellas soon and then we&#39;ll talk about the game and everything will be aaaa-ohhhkayy hahaha keeep walking...&#39;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Over the last couple months I&#39;ve been trying to put together a collection of convincing clips for various &#39;conspiracies&#39; send me a private message if you want to browse and watch what interests you and eventually tell me if you had your opinion swayed because of whatever following your curiosity lead you to check out from these clips. It&#39;s amazing to me how difficult it&#39;s been to convince any of my knee-jerk skeptical friends to even look at the titles much less actually click and watch anything.</p>

<p>Other than that though for 911 I think September Clues plus the dozen or so short related clips Simon Shack et al also put together as well as the doc called 911 Octopus are essential resources of actual reality (as opposed to the fiction they call news or history.</p>

<p>And other particular YouTuber&#39;s to check out that are reliably onto the truth of the matter regardless of the specific matter in question are some of these names RandomShots174, RedSilverJ (formerly aka TeamWakeEmUp), FreeRadioRevolution (although I think he may have had to relaunch under new username&#39;s thanks to cointelprotroll Lenny Posner), Max Malone (this guy is a World-Class talent at communicating difficult ideas with video editing and graphics that will blow you away although he is getting progressively more pisses off at how difficult it is to convince anyone to even deign to look at the amassed evidence on anything and it makes his tone of voice difficult to sit through so check out his earlier stuff on Boston Bombing and many other smaller Fakeries like Asiana 777 crash flight #?? Forgot the number but the one the news claimed they got pranked into reading fake names of supposedly dead Chinese pilots like Wee Too Low, Bang Ding Ow, Ho Lee Fuk etc...  Also track down anything Sofia Smallstorm puts together, her Sandy Hook piece is brilliant. Stackpot was another genius who had his life destroyed by gangstalking harassment for his troubles and last I heard was homeless as a result. His work was smart and art and generally focused on more than just the true/untrue of a claim but delved into some of the subtler manipulation s seemingly being sprinkled into all these relentless hoaxes. </p>

<p>Sounds like you are getting to that point where you start realizing every single thing that the mainstream mocks and dismisses is something that shouldn&#39;t be. For me anything sneered at without cause is a hallmark of something important the manipulating class does not want people knowing about/understanding. Keep up the good mind-opening!</p>
