    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. I don&#39;t &quot;want&quot; to like Trump and I&#39;m suspicious as hell of some of his motivations-- mostly all the Goldman Sachs ties.

    <div class="md"><p>Decent start in things here, a little outdated though </p>

<p>Rex Tillerson is probably involved too.
He has access to the highest levels of the Kremlin, specifically Vladimir Putin and Igor Sechin. Plus, He has to a lot to gain from the lifting of sanctions.</p>

<hr/>

<p>This <a href="http://riggedcabinet.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Rex-Tillerson-Research-Report.pdf">Rex Tillerson Research Document</a> goes into depth on the direct and indirect decades long relationship between Rex Tillerson, Rosneft, Igor Sechin, Trump Campaign, and Putin. Here&#39;s some highlights:</p>

<ul>
<li>2011: Under Rex Tillerson, ExxonMobil reached an agreement with state-owned Russian oil company Rosneft to develop hydrocarbon resources in the Black Sea. </li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>The Exxon-Rosneft agreement commits Exxon to spend about $1 billion looking for oil off Russia’s Black Sea coast, and holds the promise of sharing in the prize if it is
discovered.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>August 2011: Exxon And Rosneft entered into a wide-reaching “Strategic Cooperation Agreement” under which the companies would undertake joint exploration and development projects throughout the world. </li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Rosneft and ExxonMobil have executed a Strategic Cooperation Agreement under which the companies plan to undertake joint exploration and development of hydrocarbon resources in Russia, the United States and other countries throughout the world, and commence technology and expertise sharing activities. </p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>In 2011, Tillerson struck a deal with Rosneft chairman, Igor Sechin, as a “giant leap forward… more ambitious than man&#39;s first walk in space or sending a man to the moon.”</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Tillerson&#39;s biggest deal in Russia was announced in 2011 with Rosneft. The companies were focused on drilling for oil in three key Russian regions: the Arctic, the deepwaters of the Black Sea, and Siberia.</p>

<p>Before it was blocked by sanctions, <strong>Vladimir Putin called the Rosneft deal &quot;one of the most important involving Russia and the U.S.,&quot;</strong> forecasting it could generate $500 billion.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Rex Tillerson and Vladimir Putin met in Sochi to announce a $3.2 Billion investment by ExxonMobil and Rosneft to drill in the Arctic Kara Sea. This deal also opened up potential drilling in Texas for both parties.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Rosneft CEO Igor Sechin on expansion Of ExxonMobil-Rosneft strategic cooperation agreement: “The agreements signed today bring the already unprecedented scale of the Rosneft and ExxonMobil partnership up to a completely new level.”</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>2014: Exxon signed an agreement with Igor Sechin, Head Of Russian State Oil Company Rosneft, weeks <strong>After</strong> the U.S. imposed individual sanctions on Sechin.</li>
</ul>

<p>Tillerson routinely met with Putin and Sechin, the head of Russia’s state-owned oil company Rosneft, even after Sechin was hit with U.S. government sanctions. Along with Putin and Sechin, Tillerson orchestrated multiple billion dollar deals to collaborate with the state-owned company on drilling operations in Russia and the United States. Joint operations in Russia have benefited the Russian Government to the tune of hundreds of billions of dollars. In one instance, a $1 billion investment by Exxon in Rosneft oil holdings in the Black Sea boosted Rosneft&#39;s valuation by $7 billion. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s a series of events involving Vladimir Putin, Igor Sechin, Qatar, Carter Page, Rex Tillerson, and a dormant FBI twitter account prior to a Rosneft sale.</p>

<hr/>

<p>From the <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3259984-Trump-Intelligence-Allegations.html">dossier</a>:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Speaking in July 2016, a Russian source close to ROSNEFT President, PUTIN close associate and US-sanctioned individual, Igor SECHIN, confided the details of a recent secret meeting between him and visiting Foreign Affairs Advisor to Republican presidential candidate Donald TRUMP, Carter PAGE.</p></li>
<li><p>According to SECHIN&#39;s associate, the ROSNEFT President (CEO) had raised with PAGE the issues of future bilateral energy cooperation and prospects for an associated move to lift Ukraine-related western sanctions against Russia. PAGE had reacted positively to this demarche by SECHIN but had been generally non-committal in response.</p></li>
<li><p>In terms of the substance of their discussion, SECHIN&#39;s associate said that the ROSNEFT
President was so keen to lift personal and corporate western sanctions imposed on the
company, that <strong>he offered PAGE/TRUMP associates the brokerage of up to a 19 per cent
(privatised) stake in ROSNEFT in return.</strong> PAGE had expressed interest and confirmed that were TRUMP elected US president, then sanctions on Russia would be lifted. </p></li>

I simply see a narrative being pushed very clearly that for whatever reason I feel above and do not fall for as you clearly have.

    <div class="md"><p>Title is asking for someone to show you evidence Russia and Trump colluded to get him elected/hack the election. You then complain the guy showing you evidence that he thinks is sufficient, saying he&#39;s not showing you proof of collusion from when Trump was president. You ask for one thing, go off on a tangent and bash the guy showing you that stuff, then change the description of what you&#39;re looking for.  It seems like you just really don&#39;t want to believe there might be some collusion here and you&#39;re just gonna trash anything that might hint at it.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not the biggest believer in all the trump Russia connection, like saying Russia hacked election is kind of silly, but to deny some of the clear connections between some of his associates and Russia just shows you&#39;re stuck in your ways regarding your position on the issue. I&#39;m skeptical of the media and all that crap you&#39;re gonna say too, but at some point you&#39;ve gotta look at yourself and see if you&#39;re actually being objective and looking at it the same way you would if it was something about say Hillary, or if you&#39;re just asking for evidence just so you can shit on it to feel better about your non wavering stance on the issue.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Please don&#39;t fire any shots at me personally about what I believe or don&#39;t believe. ALL of the evidence he presented to me are merely ties between people associated with trump and business ties between trump and Russian entities prior to his presidency. Firstly, if that is enough to assume that there was collusion then he would already be in jail. Secondly, you admit that the Russian hacking narrative is silly, yet all trump/Russia collusion theories root from the same random accusation that Russia hacked the DNC. It literally has been a downward spiral of bullshit since then and if you can&#39;t see that then you don&#39;t need to be telling me I&#39;m being objective. I don&#39;t have a wavering stance on the issue because I still have seen ZERO EVIDENCE OF SUBSTANCE WHATSOEVER </p>

<p>Except, South Ossetia was not a &quot;land grab&quot;. South Ossetia declared independence from Georgia in 1991, at which point Georgia tried to establish control over it by force. After the Georgian invasion of South Ossetia in 2008, the Russian government recognised South Ossetia as an independent state.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Ossetia">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Ossetia</a></p>

<p>There was no &quot;land grab&quot;.</p>

<p>As for Crimea, it was a part of the Russian Empire for hundreds of years. Then is became part of the Soviet Union. In 1954, without consulting Crimeans, the Soviet Union granted control of Crimea to the Ukrainian Socialist Republic, also part of the Soviet Union.</p>

<p>After 1991, when the Soviet Union collapsed, Crimea declared conditional independence from Ukraine, but pressure from Ukraine kept them as an autonomous republic.</p>

<p>It was not exactly a &quot;land grab&quot; so much as it was the Russians finally recognising that the Crimeans should have a say in their own future. When given the chance <em>again</em>, the Crimeans voted to separate from Ukraine <em>again</em>, and instead join Russia. </p>

<p>Russia invaded Crimea and while under occupation held a referendum that seemed questionable at best.</p>

<p>both of these circumstances involve Russia invading another country, and recognizing independence before eventually integrating the land into Russia.  Under Putin, Russia has expanded using these methods, which are almost definitely illegal under international law.</p>

<p>I&#39;m interested in your opinion on Donetsk/Lugansk, and Russia&#39;s funding of rebels there.  It seems pretty clear to me that if the rebels are successful, and the international community does nothing, the south-eastern regions in Ukraine will become part of Russia.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The idea that a &quot;super power&quot; would stand back and allow a rival &quot;super power&quot; to hold open elections without at least <em>attempting</em> to influence the outcome of those elections is, in my mind, preposterous.</p>

<p>This does not mean there was <em>collusion</em> with any candidate, but if there was a potential for collusion, you can be sure they tried to work out a deal.</p>

<p>The US has long sought to influence elections of enemies and allies alike. Remember when Obama involved himself in the Brexit debate? Remember who he was standing beside when he tried to influence the British voter? It wasn&#39;t Nigel Farage. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>President Obama’s warning to those championing Britain’s exit from the EU was stark: Leave, he said, and the “U.K. is going to be in the back of the queue” on trade deals with the U.S.</p>

<p>The American president was flanked by David Cameron, the British prime minister, who is advocating that Britain remain in the EU.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2016/04/obamas-brexit-plea/479469/">https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2016/04/obamas-brexit-plea/479469/</a></p>

<p>That was direct, blatant interference in a British election, in collusion with then Prime Minister David Cameron. But somehow, that was simply &quot;politics&quot;.</p>

<p>Did Trump &quot;collude&quot; with Russia? I have seen no direct evidence that that was the case, but I would be shocked if the Russians didn&#39;t at least try to make a deal with him. I would be equally shocked if they didn&#39;t try to make a deal with Clinton.</p>

<p>The only difference between that, and what Obama did, is the spin the western media puts on it.</p>
