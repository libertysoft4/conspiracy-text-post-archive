        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Now I know this isn&#39;t the normal run of the mill political post that this sub is dominated by but I thought maybe you guys would like to take a look at this:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.metacritic.com/game/switch/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild/critic-reviews?sort-by=date">http://www.metacritic.com/game/switch/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild/critic-reviews?sort-by=date</a></p>

<p>Take a look at the sudden negative critic reviews around the 12th. Here are a few things that seem odd to me that stick out:</p>

<ul>
<li>For 78 reviews straight Zelda BotW was given a 90 or above since it started being reviewed with and average of 98. </li>
<li>In a 2 day period Zelda BotW received 4 reviews below 90 starting on the 12th.</li>
<li>During the timeframe those 4 reviews came in 6 total reviews came in. So the 4 reviews below 90 and 2 above 90 scoring the game 90 and 100.</li>
<li>These negative reviews gave incredibly low scores (60/100, 60/100, 70/100, and 84/100) when you compare the previous 78 critics in a row all giving the game 90/100+.</li>
</ul>

<p>So we have the first 13 days in a row 78 reviewers in a row scoring all 90 and above with an average of 98. BotW is tied for the 2nd best game of all time and only behind Ocarina of Time the N64 Zelda game. Then there is a sudden influx of negative critic reviews that knock it down to rank 17. These reviews all come in suspiciously close proximity to each other.</p>

<p>Reasons Nintendo&#39;s competitors would want to do this:</p>

<ul>
<li>The Switch is off to a fantastic start. They would want to try and slow down the accolades it&#39;s top title is getting.</li>
<li>BotW had a few marketable phrases until these sudden negative reviews came in such as &quot;BotW, the highest rated game on metacritic in 20 years.&quot; &quot;Second only to OoT.&quot; etc. These sudden reviews removed some &quot;top rated&quot; type quotes used to drive sales.</li>
<li>The Switch is dangerous to the other consoles. it is not suck being a console. It can also be a handheld and it is disruptive tech.</li>
</ul>

<p>I just find it suspicious and it was setting off my third eye when I saw it. Something seems off. I bet if someone dug into the reviewers and their histories we would find a connection to one of Nintendo&#39;s competitors.</p>

<p>Honestly this is smart (even if unethical) business if one of Nintendo&#39;s competitors did this. They move Nintendo&#39;s newest and critically acclaimed game from top of the all time list down to 17th. Whatcha think?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My brother has the game and I have to say although it is different than a normal zelda game is it definitely worth way more than a 70/100 kind of vote. You are probably on to something as the switch is kind of a cool system and concept. PS4 And microshit are getting nervous.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jim Sterling has a bee in his bonnet about Nintendo in general though so i was entirely not surprised he scored BotW so low.</p>

<p>It just proved to me how he can&#39;t be trusted to give an unbiased opinion.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll admit that I am a huge Nintendo fan and Zelda is my favourite game franchise so i know i come from a place of already expecting the game to be good.</p>

<p>I have pumped over one hundred hours into Zelda and still want to keep playing. I played Horizon Zero Dawn for about 2 days before Zelda came out and while i enjoyed what i played of it I don&#39;t feel as compelled to play it as I still do with Zelda.</p>

<p>I think those negative reviewers just wanted to knock it down a peg because they just couldn&#39;t accept a Nintendo game being as good and well reviewed as it was.</p>

<p>If BotW doesn&#39;t get game of the year at places like IGN and Giant Bomb then there is something seriously wrong.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, there is more on that front too. If you look at the initial metacritic user votes from around release there are tons of 0s. I think this is mostly trolling. If you remove those 0-2&#39;s which I believe are definitely trolling than BotW gets an insanely high user score as well. This helps me keep in mind that the public&#39;s opinion was in line with the high score as well.</p>

<p>Thanks for making me think about the inverse too but the proximity in time that the reviews had makes me think something fishy is going on. I also do not think they could have paid off 78 reviewers in a row.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m with you. So much of the Switch hype seemed so artificial. It seems like the subreddit was/is more about advertising to <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> than it is about fans of the console. The console is underpowered, cheaply made, gimmicky, the controllers are uncomfortable to hold in most configurations, it&#39;s horrifically outdated in many aspects of the software design and online service (that they now have the audacity to charge money for), and it has exactly one game worth playing on it right now. It doesn&#39;t even have fucking Netflix.</p>

<p>I think Nintendo knew they had to push this new console <em>hard</em> because of how big of a failure the WiiU was. Since the Wii, Nintendo has refused to make products that are anywhere close to modern and current-gen, and they expect their brand power and a gimmick to do all the work for them rather than actually creating a good product. They&#39;re disgusting.</p>

<p>The worst part about this is that they could be exponentially more successful if they stopped making consoles and just made games for PC, PS4, Xbox, and phones as a third-party studio. I would actually pick up Breath of the Wild if that were the case.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, you&#39;re on to something.  Now they can&#39;t say &#39;highest scored game on Metacritic.&#39;</p>

<p>The game is simply amazing and I even agree with the negative comments about the weapons being brittle and being destroyed after a few combat rounds.  However, the game does so many things spectacularly that it seems overboard to minus 30 or 40 points for one annoying trait.</p>

<p>Look at Jim Sterling for example.  He gave a 95 to Horizon Zero Dawn!  It&#39;s an amazing game but it&#39;s not better than Breath of the Wild!  There&#39;s a laundry list of things that Horizon could do better whereas there&#39;s only 2 or 3 things that Zelda could do better.</p>

<p>As somebody who&#39;s played Zelda and Horizon I&#39;m starting to feel like Sony paid for those bad reviews.</p>

<p>, but do you seriously think the competition is that scared of the Switch?</p>

<p><em>That</em> scared... How scared is &#39;that scared&#39;?</p>

<p>Scared enough for a multi billion dollar organization to pay a couple thousand or hundred bucks for a marketing company to write fake reviews? Absolutely. Social media manipulation is incredibly cheap and an important part of any modern marketing campaign.</p>

<p>The shills are actually hired by the developers themselves. Breath Of The Wild is part of a larger project made of several games which are narratively connected, and in this case there was NO RISK of the game&#39;s sales being affected by negativity. It&#39;s all part of a metagame.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I couldn&#39;t help but notice that Ars Technica&#39;s (man, have they gone to $#!+) coverage of the Switch has been ham-handedly pessimistic from the very beginning.  Like, agenda-pushingly so.</p>

<p>I know $#!+ting on things that people love is a good way to &quot;promote&quot; &quot;comment discussion&quot; but it almost feels like there&#39;s something more going on.  I&#39;ve had many great gaming experiences because of Nintendo, and especially Zelda, but I don&#39;t own a Switch (nor a Wii U, nor a Wii) and I agree that there are many legitimate criticisms of Nintendo&#39;s various business decisions.</p>

<p>But goddamn does it just seem relentless.</p>

<p>What I am saying is that you don&#39;t like facts. The switch is the fastest selling Nintendo console in history. You are butthurt about this and instead of acknowledging it as a point of discussion you just link angryjoes videos. Btw, I have met angryjoe. He is a nice guy and you are taking his videos all wrong. If you could read the room at all you would understand that his videos are about applying pressure to Nintendo so they will change their policy because he would love to cover their games. He loves many Nintendo games and wants to be able to cover them. He does not like their business policies. He loves the developers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Or how about something more realistic:</p>

<p>• 20 hours into the game all the &quot;new&quot; things which seem fresh (only on the Zelda vs Zelda scale) blow your mind.  (In reality none of the mechanics in BotW are new, but rather only new to the Zelda lineup of games.)</p>

<p>• After 40 hours in a lot of the things that used to excite you as a player no longer do because they fall into the category of mundane repetition.  Another game that comes to mind is the first Assassin&#39;s Creed.  The first few times playing the side missions are fun but once you&#39;re near endgame trying to 100% the achievements you want to break the disc in half and never play it again.  Oh look you used a magnet to pull a chest out of a lake da-na-NA-NAAAHHHH! <em>yawn</em></p>

<p>• Sponsored reviewers getting copies for free are playing since launch, and of course they&#39;re going to give good reviews.  Nintendo is going to hand out free copies to Zelda fanboys first and foremost because that&#39;s just good business.  These are the first people posting reviews.</p>

<p>• Regular Average-Joe non-sponsored honest gamers paying their own money actually hold the game accountable and compare it to other games, instead of allowing it free passes on a lot of issues plaguing the game.  Taking the game off the Zelda-Only scale warrants a good 7-8/10.  </p>

<p>• To submit an anecdotal fallacy, no one I follow on Twitch is streaming the game anymore because the fresh new smell has worn off and there&#39;s only so much of watching a little elf boy run around picking up anything that isn&#39;t tied down ala a glorified trash collecter viewers can take.  Same reason no one plays Metal Gear Solid V.  Players are hitting crafting / questing gates due to not having the correct materials in their inventory.  Can you speedrun the game in 40 minutes?  Yes, but that&#39;s not the point.  It&#39;s an open world game with MMO stylings catered to a single player experience which has been done before, but if you remove &quot;Zelda&quot; no honest reviewer on the planet would give it a perfect 10/10.</p>
