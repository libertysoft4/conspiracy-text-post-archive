<p>It would just be mind boggling that there has been <em>so many</em> leaks concerning Trump by a wide swathe of political and nonpolitical actors, that Wikileaks has never had access to private Trump information or felt the need to share any leaks concerning him. What do you guys think?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh... any of the governmental info like Vault 7 most likely come from &quot;leaks&quot; and not &quot;hacks&quot;... government contractors like Snowden that get hired by private firms and then given clearance... they got no horse in the race and just grab some files and bounce. </p>

<p>Wikileaks doesn&#39;t hack anyone on their own... they are just a dumping ground for leaks... so it&#39;s not strange at all. I&#39;m sure Trumps people are a tighter/smaller group of people with access compared to the US government. </p>

<p>Thats also why there aren&#39;t a bunch of China or Russia leaks... they are a lot smarter about not letting private contractors into their systems. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wikileaks has said that anything they were given related by Trump was less harmful than anything Trump, himself, has said. They also stated they haven&#39;t received anything publishable on Trump based on their standards.</p>

<p>I think people want to attack Wikileaks, and have created a narrative that Wikileaks is some sort of Russian front. This is mostly done to discredit the leaks that have been released because they are an embarrassment to many Western countries.</p>

<p>Most of the &quot;leaks&quot; in regard to Trump have been with unnamed US officials talking to MSM reporters. Wikileaks wouldn&#39;t report on word of mouth stories from US officials, partly because they wouldn&#39;t trust them, nor do they have reports on capital hill to get such stories. There has been very few documents released about Trump. There has been the dossier and the 2005 Tax returns. The dossier doesn&#39;t seem to be credible, so Wikileaks wouldn&#39;t have published it. Many other news agencies also chose not to publish that document until Buzzfeed did it. It seems only Rachel Maddow got the copy of the tax return.</p>

<p>Why should we trust the FBI? If they don&#39;t release evidence, then their claims shouldn&#39;t be trusted. We don&#39;t even know if the Russians hacked the DNC servers. The only company that looked at the server (crowdstrike) is owned by Google, who were backing the HRC. They claim it was the Russians based on the malware used, but the malware has been out in the wild for sometime and it was an old version of the malware. </p>

Do you have sources for any of these claims? I would be interesting in reading about it.</p>

<p>Honestly you&#39;d have to try REALLY hard to buy into the narrative that Wikileaks has never received anything Anti-Trump worth publishing... It requires a hefty amount of mental gymnastics.
Not at all. For example the &quot;Pussy-Grab&quot; video was very damaging to Trump, but it is not the type of content the Wikileaks would release. Most of the anti-Trump material wouldn&#39;t be submitted to Wikileaks. For example, if I had a copy of the &quot;Pussy-Grab&quot; video would I submitted it to the MSM or Wikileaks? I know I wouldn&#39;t even bother sending it to Wikileaks. Most damaging material about Trump would probably be better suited for other publication and thus wouldn&#39;t be submitted to Wikileaks.</p>

<p>Yes we do, you&#39;re either high as fucking or simply ignoring basic facts.
No evidence has been released. No government agency had physical access to the server. We only have a report from a company associated with the HRC campaign. The FBI only got information from third parties. </p>

<p>According to the FBI official, “This left the FBI no choice but to rely upon a third party for information. These actions caused significant delays and inhibited the FBI from addressing the intrusion earlier.”

<p>That is not evidence. That is a statement. The government makes the following claim:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The U.S. Intelligence Community (USIC) is confident that the Russian Government directed the recent compromises of e-mails from US persons and institutions, including from US political organizations. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is no public evidence to support that claim. What you claim is a fact, is actually and unsupported statement. I personally do not feel like blinding supporting unsupported claims from agencies that frequently lie to the general public. Especially considering that the government <strong>never had physical access to the server and based on all their analysis on reports by a third party company</strong>. </p>
