        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hello all, I posted this a while back and got nearly zero views, likes, or comments, and I felt was lost among the hundreds of post made everyday. Please feel free to read and help gather more evidence.</p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/a/LaORS">http://imgur.com/a/LaORS</a> We have all heard the laughable accusations against Mr. Trump by Mainstream media such as, but not limited to, CNN, CSNBC, Washington Post, and the Daily Beast, that Mr. Trump has the Russian interest in mind or that he is in Fact a Russian puppet. Although most can use common sense to come to a conclusion that this is false, MSM still insist that The Donald is a sexist and corrupt man who can only be known for his failing casinos, despite providing thousands of Americans with jobs. Despite MSM depiction of Trump as a pro-Russian insider who will only bring the USA closer to collapse, the real media blackout is against the Clinton Foundation&#39;s corruption as well as other interesting revelations uncovered through wikileaks. We have all heard of the sex trafficing and sex slave operations (Comet Ping Pong) and other accusations, some more skeptical than others, but even reddit<a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and wikileaks has failed to talk much about the PODESTA GROUP. Through simple digging through wikipedia (ironically not wikileaks), it is evident that not only is the MSM depictions of Trump as a racist, sexist, Russian lover multi-billionaire seemingly false, but is also failing to cover anything about the PODESTA GROUP, a lobbying firm founded by Tony Podesta, brother to John Podesta (but I&#39;m positive most of you have already heard of his shady business). I am creating this link to not only show the people of reddit the truth behind the Podesta Group, but also ask for your assistance in more digging. Remember, there is strength in numbers. so let me outline this for you.
Tony Podesta founded the Podesta Group in 1988. The Podesta group is a lobbying and public affairs firm that has deep ties with the Democratic Party as well as the Obama administration. Without going into specific details, let me break down some key points about the Podesta Firm. I have done my reading but for the sake of time I will make a few key points. For quick links to some names mentioned in this post, please refer to the Podesta Group wikipedia or take it upon yourself to use whichever sources you want to conduct your investigation.
1.The Podesta Group has been retained by Wal-Mart, BP and Lockheed Martin.&quot;[5] Other clients include Abdisalam Omer, the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity, Amgen, Bank Of America, Cherokee Nation (Casinos), Cintas, Covidien, Duke Energy, Egypt, Genentech, General Dynamics, Harrah&#39;s Entertainment, Heineken, Merck, Michelin, National Association of Broadcasters (NAB), National Public Radio (NPR), Nestle, Novartis, Orange County, Florida, Raytheon, Reed Elsevier, Republic of Albania, Republic of Georgia, Sallie Mae, Sunoco, Synthetic Genomics, TJX Companies, Tyco Electronics, Republic of Kenya and United Technologies.[9][10][11]
The Podesta Group also lobbies for Egypt and US policies that reach as for as the executive branch and congress.
The Podesta Group also received $900,000 in revenue to lobby for Ukraine in D.C.
At the same time, Podesta Group also represents Sberbank of Russia, which is one of Russia&#39;s Largest financial Institutions which controls 30% of all Russian Banking assets (THIS IS HUGE) <a href="http://imgur.com/a/7POH5">http://imgur.com/a/7POH5</a>
5.Nearly just as important, Podesta Group also receives approx. $60,000 USD a month from the nation of Azerbijan (oh plus expenses). Now, for those who aren&#39;t familiar know Azerbijan you can do more reading online, but basically they are a somewhat totalitarian nation who says it is for free speech, but in practice censors and imprisons political activist, journalist, and citizen&#39;s who don&#39;t agree with the status quo. ALL foreign broadcasting of any sort is banned here.<a href="http://imgur.com/a/n4iAb">http://imgur.com/a/n4iAb</a>
Podesta Group lobbies for is a non-profit called American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity which works to improve upon environmental issues of the coal industry working towards a cleaner coal industry (I am including this because it is pretty ironic that a man who&#39;s brother is lobbying for a clean coal industry and an increase in that industry is also supporting Hillary Clinton, who, as many know, wants to destroy the American coal industry).
As of now, I have just laid out a few points to consider looking into more. redditors and patriots, I need your help doing some more digging into the Podesta Group and the Podesta&#39;s in general, but don&#39;t forget who is the real criminal in the mist.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Please help shed some light on this. I have posted before but with so many post on this sub reddit every second, it gets easily lost among less important topics. The fact that this isn&#39;t talked about in MSM is sad, but honestly, I&#39;m not surprised.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So let me get this straight. Trump is under criminal investigation by the FBI for possible collisions with Russia during the campaign. Two of his main guys had to step down because they were being paid off by the Russian government. His secretary of state had to recuse himself for lying to Congress. So you don&#39;t give a fuck about any of that. But you care deeply about podesta&#39;s ties to Russia. That&#39;s fucking hilarious dude. I like your pom-poms.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Notice how you said &quot;Possible&quot; even though the FBI said that there isn&#39;t a &quot;Spark of evidence&quot; to show that Russian collusion effected the election in anyway, much less that Trump or his campaign was working with them. And also, his &quot;main guy&quot; was one of his very early memebers, which TRUMP FIRED, after jsut a few months, which may have been because he found out he had worked with Russians before. TBH, I could care less if one of Trumps cabinet members had a phone call or too with trump, but I do care when Hillary Clinton&#39;s campaign manager has DIRECT ties with a Russian owned Bank, having lobbied for them for years. Also, you are the one who failed to read the rest of the post, where I also tied Tony and John Podesta&#39;s lobbying firm to possibly the most journalist-hating country on the planet, reminding me of Hitler&#39;s Germany. Get out of here with you fake news nonsense and look at the big picture. Anyone who actually thinks, after multiple sources have denied, that Trump worked with Russia to undermine the most important democratic election to date, and did so unnoticed to multiple (17 thanks to Obama), money sucking, put somewhat protective intelligence agencies, is just absolutely ridiculous.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, and before you come on this post spreading lies, you need to check your sources. NO WHERE can i find a source that actually says that the President of the United States in under criminal investigation. NO WHERE. You seem to be uneducated in what a criminal investigation is, you know, like Mrs. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, who IS under a criminal probe for unauthorized computer access. Get.your.facts.straight.</p>

<p>Sorry to break your bubble, but it didn&#39;t go &quot;unnoticed&quot;.<br/>
