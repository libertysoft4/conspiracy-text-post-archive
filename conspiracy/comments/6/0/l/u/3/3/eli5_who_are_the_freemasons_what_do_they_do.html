<p>Now, I&#39;m sure someone is going to come along and explain the conspiracy side of it. My grandfather was some master rank member (dont know the actual name off the top of my head, but the plaque was in his bedroom) so I&#39;m like 95% sure he took some secrets to the grave.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Any group can. Any group. Look at any large group in society that exists over time and there is a small segment that always contains corrupt individuals.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why it is important to know what you want in a group and who make it up. My lodge doesn&#39;t suffer the corrupt or foolish.</p>

<p>It use to be that people joined together and interacted. That&#39;s where Masons and other groups started. </p>

<p>Societies that taught self improvement and having a vote were banned by the church and crowns. Of course they painted any threat to their rule in the worst lies. When they couldn&#39;t beat them they made their own. Unfortunately the secrecy that kept the fraternity going, and gave birth to the idea that people have the right to represent themselves, now feeds the rumor mill.</p>

<p>It&#39;s too bad the the Masons and Shiners are aging out of the time when their true tenants are needed most by society.</p>

<p>That&#39;s not a coincidence. The Mafia is structured as a fraternity. The only difference between the Mafia and our order is that we teach a system of moral philosophy for the betterment of the individual while the Mafia kills people... :-)</p>

<p>a) You don&#39;t have to protect your Brothers in doing what is against the principles of the Fraternity, that&#39;s an important caveat that appears in one way or another in every one of our lessons b) all of our secrets were published in the 18th century and have been published and re-published dozens of times since. The true secret of Freemasonry isn&#39;t  something that it&#39;s <em>possible</em> to give away, so  no not quite.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The conspiracy is simple. We teach a system of moral philosophy that is the backbone of the Enlightenment. The fact that that doesn&#39;t seem very subversive today is evidence that we did our job. I mean that quite literally, and though there&#39;s more to what we do than teaching that system of moral philosophy, that&#39;s really what&#39;s at the root of why, for example, the Catholic Church dislikes us so much. Any organization, religion or individual that feels that reason should not be a tool of the average man will find what we do distasteful at the least.</p>

<p>But the silly &quot;Masons worship Satan&quot; nonsense all came out of a 19th century hoax, and then got conflated in the 20th century with various other strains of ethnic and governmental conspiracy theory because that&#39;s how these things work.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you think the morality tests have fluid answers that determine the path you advance down?</p>

<p>I realize that the schools you attend are your choice. What I&#39;m trying to ask is kind of complex but I&#39;m pretty sure that the idea has been presented to you in some form in the past (stories, jokes). </p>

<p>E.g.: You are handed a gun, told it&#39;s loaded, placed in a room with a dog, and told to shoot the dog. If you decide not to, you have made the right decision and continue your studies. BUT if you decide TO shoot the dog (blanks or not), you have also passed and continue your studies but with a possible extra or different door or set of doors being opened to you. </p>

<p>IMO this very old tactic of rooting out &quot;worthy&quot; candidates would serve many purposes including hiding the cabal at the top from the public by using the rest of the org as a smoke screen. </p>

<p>I would hope that any secretive organization that tests your morality would be of interest.</p>

<p>Why? Ok, this might be more difficult for some but please try to use your imagination at least a little. The long in short, it allows you to hide behind a trusted and benevolent organization while simultaneously providing you a method of identifying people that might fit a certain agenda.</p>

<p>It&#39;s clever but not really that complex of a notion. There was even an old masons joke about it. Guy put in room with wife and gun and told to make his choice. The org or his wife. The people waiting outside the room hear the gunshots and a bunch of commotion and after a few minutes the man emerges with blood all over saying something along the lines of &quot;some idiot loaded the gun with blanks so I had to beat her to death&quot;. I&#39;ve even seen more recent versions where the roles were reversed or whatever else was changed but the joke is always the same. This is not some novel new concept created by the author of &quot;kingsman&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I ask a lot of questions. I get a lot of answers. Some better than others.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been led to this line of conjecture by a couple of different people aside from the joke. One is a former mason, the other is a grandson/son/brother of very well to do masons. Both are pretty busy people so I&#39;m less than inclined to think that these people would spend so much time burning the midnight oil explaining things to me and answering my questions only to make up some shit to fuck with me. I believe it&#39;s purely speculitive in both regards though and neither knows of the other.</p>

<p>I would hope that any secretive organization that tests ones morality would be heavily scrutinized by its members. I doubt that IOSH for example would have any qualms in killing any animal outright, therefore morality is subjective to the groupthink. IOSH may have a very different answer to this question than your run of the mill masonic lodge.</p>

<p>The same road can lead different people to many different places in the same way that different paths can lead strangers to the same place. So if the question is philosophical, any answer becomes correct in a sense but it may be that a different answer requires a different path. </p>

<p>About the rest, I believe you. I don&#39;t think animals are even necessary for a morality test really but I doubt that the masons are actively engaged in this sort of behavior and I&#39;m fully aware of the campaigns to discredit or destroy knowledge historically.</p>

<p>That being said, do you think a sister/offshoot or parallel organization might exist? Newtons third law could be said to agree with the taoist philosophy of yin-yang. What would you consider to be the equal and opposite or dark contradiction to your organization? </p>

<p>No. Your below metaphor is most definitely possible because of a tradition in the Scottish Rite.</p>

<p>When you advance, a &quot;degree&quot; is put on, where you essentially show that you are capable of understanding and interpreting teachings.</p>

<p>Except the 33rd degree. There is no proficiency needed. You must be invited to perform the 33rd degree, which I <em>really</em> don&#39;t like.</p>

<p>The Masons prize their tradition on vertical or horizontal mobility in the organizations. You can become a Master Mason in a month, be raised, and enter any organization to learn lessons and history quickly. None of which seems to have a reason to be hidden besides the intensity of radical institutions.</p>

<p>Then there is a hidden door. It just doesn&#39;t sit well with me; and makes my tinfoil hat start to tune in all kinds of &quot;what ifs&quot;. </p>

<p>The 33rd degree is a relatively new degree, as well. Becoming tradition just after the founding of our nation.</p>

<p>I have some understanding of the way in which you earn a degree. I was led to believe that the (possibly Crowley) schools involved tests of morality and if such tests exist they may not have just the one answer. </p>

<li>The lessons of the Blue Lodge teach us of the universality of Freemasonry.  Yet, the Knights Templar is open only to  Christians (in most places). Do you think that the Commandery degrees would benefit from becoming more symbolic/speculative and less of a Christian special-interest group?</li>

    <div class="md"><p>The <a href="https://imgur.com/a/G76A9">big hats</a> are similar to the <a href="http://lemerg.com/data/wallpapers/6/898038.jpg">birds of paradise</a>. We use them to attract masonic women, in hopes of breeding and making new little Knights Of Christ.</p>

<p>Every Mason would benefit from seeing the degrees that the Commandery puts on. Like we&#39;re taught when we&#39;re first brought to light, all men and life come from the same great Earth. It being a Christian specific(mostly) branch is due to the degrees specifically mentioning a faith in Jesus Christ. Since the GAOTU, represents any who believe in a higher power, I believe it is in the interest in the Commandery to remain Christian <em>because</em> of it&#39;s Christian teachings and artifacts.</p>

<p>Have you been raised, brother?</p>

<p>Yes, but other degrees go into elements of, for example, Old Testament allegory, and I&#39;m not an Abrahamic theist. There&#39;s no problem there. These are symbolic and speculative degrees. There&#39;s no reason that I can&#39;t draw on those lessons without specifically being of that faith, right?</p>

<p>I&#39;m in the York Rite, qualified for the Commandery degrees and about to move into the East of my Chapter, but I&#39;ve hesitated even though I&#39;ve been told I&#39;d be welcome in the Commandery as a non-Christian. It still feels odd given that so many Commanderies reject non-Christians. Not sure if I should, which is why I ask.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Commandery invokes Jesus Christ specifically. Trust me, the symbolism of our degrees is not as open to interpretation as the Blue Lodge. You might find yourself feeling persecuted.</p>

<p>If your faith isn&#39;t one that takes itself seriously, you will benefit from the knowledge. As you will be Knighted, you must swear allegiance to Christ. Which is understandably uncomfortable for a lot of non-Christian Brothers. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t want to get into the details, but in the Chapter, the symbolism isn&#39;t very thin. At the end of the MEM degree, if you&#39;re not an Abrahamic theist, you&#39;re going to have to exercise some serious symbolic interpretation as you take part in the completion of that degree (as I did)!</p>

<p>That&#39;s what I was referring to.</p>

<p>Anyway, thank you for your input. It&#39;s been food for thought!</p>
