<p>I&#39;m not a Flat Earther (Earth is definitely hollow as is every planet) but I think Flat Earth Theory argues that there are no other planets (even though you can get a telescope and see them yourself) and that&#39;s all part of the conspiracy to hide God</p>

    <div class="md"><p>there are a multitude of reasons, here are some of my favorites. Let&#39;s say the earth isn&#39;t what they say, maybe not flat earth, but reality itself isn&#39;t as we&#39;re taught, why? </p>

<p>If we&#39;re in a simulation and there is an artificial boundary that was set within the simulation, what we know as the North/South poles, if people knew that we were sims, or at least part of a simulation, that would fundamentally change life. </p>

<p>Flat earth has been around so so much longer than the round earth, and as much as people want to say we have satellite photos proving the earth is round, the truth is every single one of those photos is created via CGI, None of us have ever seen a Raw picture of our planet. If it is flat earth, that plays into what God, religion, tells us about our earth, that it is fixed and unmoveable, that there is a firmament and waters above. If it&#39;s true, that the world is flat and that there is a barrier that is unseeable to the eye but physically impassable, it would show definitely once and for all, without doubt, that there was/is a creator. </p>

<p>This all leads us into dangerous territory, why, if there is a firmament, did the government literally slam nuke after nuke into it? what were they hoping to achieve, could that have killed/ended everything, why would the government have spent billions upon billions on a space program, when in &#39;reality&#39; it would have been a psyop program. </p>

<p>There are SO many reasons to lie and keep it secret, if only just to stop people from giving up on governments and society as it is now, if we knew this was a simulation, or that there was a definitive creator and our &#39;leaders&#39; have been intentionally spitting in the creator&#39;s eye, would people stand idly by? would they support it, even with all the lies and manipulation that&#39;s been pulled on us all. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re asking the right questions.</p>

<p>It does seem silly to <em>intentionally</em> create a flat Earth conspiracy. And yet here we are in a world where some people believe the world is flat.</p>

<p>If there was intent, I could imagine the idea behind it being that humans aren&#39;t going to be allowed to elevate until everyone is on the same page. As long as humans are out there believing in a flat Earth, all humans are classified as primitive non-sentient beings.</p>

<p>But... in reality... it&#39;s more likely the conspiracy took hold incidently and organically. Because why not? Why wouldn&#39;t having thrown as much shit to the wall as possible, that <em>some</em> of it may stick? It just happens to be flat Earth, it could have just as easily been Two Moons or Atlantis.</p>
