    <div class="md"><p>Delonge&#39;s recent work is with Peter Levenda of the &#39;Simon Necronomicon&#39; hoax from the late 70&#39;s.  He has bounced around occult and intelligence circles for years and he is an admitted member of the AFIO.  It is an intelligence fraternity and think tank that occasionally sponsors geo-political lectures for its members in large metro areas.</p>

<p>Want to see a wonderful picture of Delonge, Levenda, and Podesta scroll down here:</p>

<p><a href="http://mysteriousuniverse.org/2016/11/the-delonge-delusion-part-one/">http://mysteriousuniverse.org/2016/11/the-delonge-delusion-part-one/</a>  </p>

<p>I&#39;m not entirely sure what to make of his corpus of Levenda&#39;s books but he is tied into a group that has worked with Adventure Unlimited Press in the past.  This includes Joseph Farrell, Scott de Hart, Catherine Austin Fitts, Walter Bosley and several other alternative conspiracy writers that are bandied about here.</p>

<p>It just so happens they include and share the same mythos from the &#39;Vienna Lodge&#39; of esoteric Nazis of Wilhelm Landig.  This includes the Thule and Vril Society Nazi UFO mythos.  While various of them will discount various portions of it they do borrow the inherent myth at its core.</p>

<p>Farrell, Levenda, and now Delonge all speculate that SS General Hans Kammler special research group was working on a top secret &#39;Die Glocke&#39; project towards the end of the war.  Kammler was virtually unknown at Nuremberg and reported dead in a bevy of ways by all of his staff officers and in one history of the Das Reich a young European princess from Luxemborg supposedly saw him shot in the street of Prague in his command car around his disappearance.  Direct evidence of his behavior and some mentions of his special staff came out at the post war Oswald Pohl trial.</p>

<p>Nick Cook&#39;s &#39;Hunt for Zero Point&#39; has a more curious and fairer view of the Kammler story and Nazi UFO mythos.  Kammler himself was actually a mysterious character outside of Vienna Lodge circles until Tom Agoston&#39;s publishing of &quot;Blunder&quot; in the mid 1980s.  This detailed how the US supposedly lost a German weapon&#39;s think tank to the Soviets.  Agoston was contacted before his death by an American researcher, Carl Oglesby, who had blown the lid of US documentation research of the Gehlen Org with a lawsuit.  He took some of the Kammler rumblings seriously...  His papers are at the University of Massachusetts if anyone is in the area and interested. </p>

<p>Recently more documentation has show that Kammler was hanging around the German-Swiss border where he stashed von Braun, Dornberger, and other members of his &#39;Kammlerstab&#39; were vacuumed up by US intelligence.</p>

<p>This special project group included flying saucers, supposedly.  There is now some archival anecdotes from interviews and Paperclip personnel files that the Germans had at least put those ideas to papers.</p>

<p>Throw in Delonge&#39;s newest addition to this mythos and white washing of Operation Paperclip from Chasing Shadows and you find that Kammler had in his possession an Ancient Alien artifact that was communicating technological advances to the Germans.  Likely at least in the storyline recovered during the initial German foray into Antarctica.</p>

<p>This of course matches in broad strokes the Vril Society myth pushed by Landig and others in North American Neo-Nazi circles.</p>

<p>Of course... this would not be peculiar at all if Delonge did not have successive email meeting invites with:</p>

<p>Current documentation out of Germany and stored away by Army CIC in document centers there is now leaning towards Kammler having been sucked by counter intelligence after the war.  According to the son of a supposed former Eisenhower aide and OSS member (who does not appear on any of the disclosed operative lists), he died in US custody in 1948.</p>

<p>Where all of this is going, I&#39;m not entirely sure but there is an awfully big brush fire here.  I don&#39;t buy their Bormann Group supported Breakway Civilization thesis versus the kind and benevolent US Army Military Industrial Complex.</p>

<p>However it is looking more and more like, we covered up letting one of the worst Nazis still left alive in May 1945 in exchange for the keys to his black ops project. </p>

<p>So much has happened in this genre of &#39;conspiracy theory&#39;, occultism, and even the actual historical portions since Jocelyn Goodwin wrote his book Arktos and Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke wrote Black Sun and the Occult Roots of Nazism.</p>

<p>Nevermind the active declassification of documents every day, Rainer Karlsch&#39;s recent document discoveries.  Add on top of that the constant spin and insanity that the whole Coast to Coast AM-Ancient Aliens Media Complex gives this topic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Given your scholarly research on the subject, I&#39;m curious as to what you think about the occult connections with the Nazi party -- specifically along the lines of the OTO, Golden Dawn, etc -- as Himmler and his group introduced those esoteric concepts as the religious arm of the burgeoning political Nazi movement.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve read (unsubstantiated) post-war accounts where scientists such as von Braun and other formerly-German rocket scientists claimed much of the technology they developed was due to information they&#39;d received from spiritual sources.</p>

<p>And while I don&#39;t buy into the &quot;ancient aliens&quot; nonsense, I do believe there are some heavy, demonic forces interested in masquerading as such.  And interested in feeding into the destruction that was WWII in general, and the Nazi war machine in particular.</p>

<p>Again, while I don&#39;t expect you to believe that, I&#39;m curious about your perspective as a researcher and scholar.  Thanks!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>“We cannot take the credit for our record advancement in certain scientific fields alone; we have been helped.”</p>

<p>When asked by whom, he replied:</p>

<p>“The people of other worlds.”</p>

<p>As far as I can tell that its modern popularity is from an interview cited by Johnathan Eisen in “Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries”.  You could find it much earlier in another book “Did Spacemen Colonize the Earth?” from Robin Collyns where it is attributed without a source to Oberth.  Most of the time I have seen that cited in other works it is either unattributed or from Collyns.  Oberth did write an interesting piece in 50’s science magazine titled, “Flying Saucers Come from a Distant World” that at least describes his public world view on the subject.  He also did a large set of speaking tours on that very subject that use to be available on some older UFOlogy boards.  He had several other articles that appeared in magazines over the years that are still relatively accessible on the internet but none of them correlate with the interesting comments ascribed to him by later sources.  </p>

<p>WVB has a whole cottage industrial of apocryphal comments that have sprung up around him after death as I’m sure you are aware.</p>

<p>As for the Reich &amp; the Occult…  The eventual conclusions of both sets of book will be unpopular around here but Jocelyn Goodwin’s ‘Arktos’ goes into fully documented detail on the 19th century pet occult practices of hollow earth, flat earth, world ice theory, and how this shaped Ahnenerbe philosophy and eventually Himmler’s philosophy.  Goodwin eventually ties this back to Kammler, Evola, Landig, and Nazi UFOs but the ramifications for American conspiracy culture are disturbing.  Goodwin has written a lot of esoteric books I’ve ended up appreciating for his thoroughness in citation and ability to go back right to the primary source.
Second set of books by Nicholas Clarke-Goodrick, ‘Occult Roots of Nazism’ and ‘Black Sun’ are excellently cited and should be viewed as a whole.  The first book once it is out of the backstory of primary source material from OTO, OTA, Blavatsky, and other 19th century mystics delves into Himmler’s obsession with combating the Rosicrucian-Masonic Complex and the Vatican to reassert the rights of Ultima Thule.  Wilhelm Landig’s trilogy which did more for American Conspiracy culture than anything else since the 1800’s, picks right back up on Himmler’s trail into the esoteric.  NCG’s ultimate conclusions would be extraordinarily uncomfortable for readers of this community left and right however.</p>

<p>Something on the Nazi-Occult end I think that gets overlooked in the US as it is tainted by the poorly citation from ‘Morning of the Magicians’ is the Otto Rahn connection to the Ahnenerbe and his two interesting and peculiar books, ‘Lucifer’s Court’ and ‘Quest for the Grail’.  Some of the ‘Lords of the Blackstone’ or ‘Knights of the Blackstone’ material that float around in German circles are especially interesting from an occult perspective.  It is all idle speculation without sourcing but the legend is that Cathars had the true Grail in the form of a stone that fell out of Lucifer’s Crown when he was cast from heaven.  It was either retrieved by Rahn before his death or by Skorzany in ’44 in France in that lore.  It was through this stone that the Germans were communicating with entities beyond our ken.  In American culture it appears that idea has been picked up by Jim Marrs recently or I had listened and taken some notes of lecture uploaded to YouTube where he spoke about the topic.  The source material labels the Christian/Jewish/Islamic God as a false God that is enslaving mankind and that its worshippers should be relegated to slave labor for the Thule or Aryan man.  Even more synchronicity that Rahn was a partial inspiration for ‘Raiders of the Lost Ark’ and it makes the telephone to God scene with Dr. Jones more twisted.</p>

<p>If you can read German for the Occult, Rudiger Sunner’s ‘The Black Sun’, is incendiary, several American conspiracy writers use his work without citation because it has only been available in German.  There is a DVD with English subtitles but it is not as expansive as the book.  It ties into Goodwin and Goodrick’s own work excellently and brings up… a lot of topics you find here on a daily basis.
This whole subject is extraordinarily Fortean, why I find it interesting over conventional historical topics, when you think you’ve learned everything and tracked down every single shard… Something new pops up ex nihilo.</p>

<p>And to be clear, I&#39;m not saying that I believe it&#39;s nothing, there&#39;s just a bit too much going on for that conclusion in my view, but anyone who claims to know one way or the other is almost certainly lying to you.

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s one of my favorite theories. It&#39;s both incredibly outlandish and somehow at least conceivable. Flat earth has a few interesting arguments that could potentially make sense but falls flat (haha) when it&#39;s put in the context of actually observable reality.</p>

<p>I know we have no true picture of our blue marble as a whole (for some reason (Van Allen Belt?)), but we have plenty of section photographs of earth taken from the ISS showing a clear curvature. </p>

<p>There&#39;s still a fuckton that&#39;s fishy regarding our space programs and our understanding of the cosmos as well I would wager, but the general shape of our planet (or realm as Tesla called it) at least seems verifiably spherical. </p>

<p>This IMO is what makes it so interesting. More than likely it&#39;ll be something inconsequential (e.g. just a weird geological structure or remnants of the Moon&#39;s formation), but I hope it&#39;s something more for one very simple reason - anything we find that makes us go &quot;We don&#39;t know what this is&quot; pushes us forward (or destroys us; we can&#39;t win them all :p)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No one has linked the actual anomaly?</p>

<p>Its the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilkes_Land_crater">Wilkes Land Crater...</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Wilkes Land crater is an informal term that may apply to two separate cases of conjectured giant impact craters hidden beneath the ice cap of Wilkes Land, East Antarctica. These are separated below under the heading Wilkes Land anomaly and Wilkes Land mascon (mass concentration), based on terms used in their principal published reference sources.</p>

<p>The team used gravity measurements by NASA&#39;s GRACE satellites to identify a 300 km (190 mi) wide mass concentration and noted that this mass anomaly is centered within a larger ring-like structure visible in radar images of the land surface beneath the Antarctic ice cap. This combination suggested to them that the feature may mark the site of a 480 km (300 mi) wide impact crater buried beneath the ice and more than 2.5 times larger than the 180 km (110 mi) Chicxulub crater.</p>

<p>Due to the site&#39;s location beneath the Antarctic ice sheet there are no direct samples to test for evidence of impact. There are alternative explanations for this mass concentration, such as formation by a mantle plume or other large-scale volcanic activity. If this feature really is an impact crater then, based on the size of the ring structure, it has been suggested by Frese&#39;s team that the impactor could have been four or five times wider than the Chicxulub impactor, which is believed to have caused the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Essentially it&#39;s big, and it&#39;s round, and it&#39;s pulling down on the sattelites moreso than the other parts around it which leads them to believe its a crater. Apparently giant craters allow soft rock from the mantle to push up into the crust and create a denser area, which in turn has a stronger pull due to gravity.</p>

<p>So, it really could be anything. We <em>assume</em> it&#39;s a crater because this is typical of a crater, and it&#39;s big and round.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve long held the suspicion that the moon was either man made, or at least carefully placed by man, as a way to originally terraform Earth. </p>

<p>The fact that it is the perfect distance from Earth to be almost a dead match to the relative size of the Sun from Earth (allowing for a total lunar eclipse), and the fact that its rotation and orbit are also just perfect enough to have the same side facing Earth at all times, are both too calculated to happen by chance (IMO obviously).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Whats odd about that Wilkes Land Crater is that the &quot;first&quot; guy to propose this idea, R. A. Schmidt (fishy name), doesn&#39;t have his own wikipeida page. So I googled him and found documents provided by NASA where he actually goes into what he found. Strange metallic particles and shit. </p>
