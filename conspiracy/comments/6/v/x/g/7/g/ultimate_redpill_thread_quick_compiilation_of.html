<li>Countries are artificial. The only actual differencies are based on genom: slavic, nordic, black, arabic etc.</li>
<li>No government of any major country is elected by human vote and has no way to defend national interests but plays it&#39;s role in grand plan.</li>
<li>The ultimate power is money, all the power goes back to Switzerland and to Basel. That&#39;s why switzerland was not affected at all not by world war1, not by world war 2.<br/></li>
<li>Money do not lose value. Inflation is the way bankers extract money from the bottom by creating more debt.</li>
<li>All regional servants of world elites are obliged to: fuck, kill and sometimes eat children.</li>
<li>Lucefian agenda is being pushed with Gnosticism, Kaballah, Esoteric teachings, Matrix simulation idea, Hinduism and others.</li>
<li>Satan is not creature with horns but a terminology for an opposer and many creatures can be Satans. Lucifer is original Satan.</li>
<li>Compilation of main ideas of Luciferianism:
Material world is an illusionary world.
Every being must escape material world by all costs(drugs, alcohol, suicide).
Golden billion concept is the ultimate way of removal of 7 billion souls from material plane.
They teach that material world is the world of suffer so you should escape into original one source from here.
I could bring more information here but overall life in material plane is the ultimate way of manifestation, shaping matter and mastering it. Not every soul is deserved to be born in material plane. Lots of  ideas above were found in &quot;accidental discovery&quot; of so called gnostic scriptures.</li>
<li>Elites never almost never interbreed with other humans unless you have that &quot;thing&quot; in your eye which indicates that you possess desired genome.</li>
<li>Jews are artificial nation raised and created in desert by Moses which forced them to go in circles for 40 years so old would die and newborn will be different.</li>
<li>Greys or reptillians are not accepted as ET because they are not ET and never been ETs. They are natural to this planet and were described as demons, gin, and in fairy tails as dragons with several heads.</li>
<li>Pineal gland of every human brain is the connection point of spirit and matter. It is the &quot;all seeing eye&quot;.</li>
<li>General Electric is one of the most powerful organisations and main corporation of elites. They were the ones who started with commercializing electricity and now make machinery for almost every complicated invention in the world. Additionally they were the ones who:
&quot;Analyzed&quot; moon ground collected with Appollo.
Invented sattelites map which now everyone uses in GPS, Google maps etc.
They&#39;ve made a broadcast of &quot;human landing on moon&quot;.
They&#39;ve forced then tons of movies of ET through Universal corporation.
GE almost completely owns every industry in Iraq after the war.
GE was the company which electrified USSR.
If you have any nuclear powerplant(like Fukushima for example) or electric powerplant or plane or complicated machinery in any country of the world. Most likely it was either done through General Electric officially or through it&#39;s regional subordinaries.</li>
<li>On 15th of September it is planned to crash Cassini with it&#39;s 33 kg of Plutonium into Saturn atmosphere in preparation to feast of Trumpets on 23rd of September.
Enough for now. Come later for part2.</li>

    <div class="md"><p>Every religion which says that material plane is irrelevant and you should nullify your karma and escape it is the Luceferian agenda. In Rosicrucian Kaballah Luceferian way is considered to be a desire of every soul to be in absolute nirvana which basically means stagnation. Hinduism is very close in it&#39;s teaching to every esoteric teaching like jewish kaballah, gnosticism etc. Basically it says that your goal is &quot;to become God and leave this place for good&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I completely agree. Just found it interesting that out of all world religions you mentioned Hinduism so specifically. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You just have to understand that I don&#39;t say that Luciferian agenda is wrong. I don&#39;t know honestly. As there was a reason for human to be born in material plane there is also agenda for them not to be born. I don&#39;t know which one is right as it requires much more study before I can come to any significant conclusion. You can also check out some of me previous posts here: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/awakening_2016/">https://www.reddit.com/r/awakening_2016/</a>

    <div class="md"><p>jesus originally taught that his kingdom would be on earth and he would be king of a new just society where the rich would be overthrown. this prophecy failed and he died on the cross. later the temple in Jerusalem was destroyed by the romans and it looked like maybe jesus was right it just took a while, Christianity took over the roman empire. That was the kingdom on earth. then roman empire collapsed. Catholic church got corrupt. Centuries of dark ages. But Jesus may return, that is the prophecy anyway.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;kingdom on earth and would rule over a just society... etc etc&quot; -- That&#39;s the second coming.  He came here first to die for us so that through him we may all be saved and be a part of the kingdom to come.  He brought about a new covenant, making old one obsolete.  The Jews rejected him, but they always mess up the first time.  They&#39;ll acknowledge he is the Messiah at the start of the second coming.  Due to their rejection of him, he said they would be scattered.  70 AD- The temple is destroyed and they, following the old covenant, had no way to sacrifice lambs to God, this no way to be forgiven for sin.  Easy solution - believe in Jesus!  But, they still refused and were forced to alter the religion, basing salvation doctrine on the opinions of their ancestors (Talmud), not the infallible Word of God.  It&#39;s not too late, Jews.  Jesus loves you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>jesus believed in Talmud and said to follow law of moses. paul didn&#39;t want to preach that because it was too hard to get gentiles to convert to Judaism. Jesus brother James kept the true church of Jesus going but he was ignored in catholic history because they wanted to say Mary was a virgin forever so why would Jesus have a brother.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It does not matter where and how you study. You can watch podcasts, read books, read articles, watch videos or anything else. At some point after you havve done this for a long time eventually you will be able to easily filter the wrong information from the correct one because it will easily contradict with everything else you have studied. So after this it does not matter what is the source of your information. Only if you are just beginning to dive into it then it will be easier to start with trustful sources so you won&#39;t be derived to a wrong way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like your post and the way you reply!</p>

<p>Just recently I found out that Moses held the Israelites in the desert for 40 years to let the original generation die off and the offspring could be indoctrinated into Judaism easier. The originals weren&#39;t taking well to his BS religion crafting and slid back to worship of the bull, under Moses&#39; brother Aaron&#39;s watch.</p>

<p>If you could elaborate on the Reptilian/Grey stuff that would be great. It has never really captivated me but if there are good avenues of research I would like to know.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most of the jews are victims of egyptian priests. Not only Moses completely erased their history and culture and replaced it with new goals &amp; targets. He introduced circumcision on 8th day and it&#39;s basically circumsion of soul because done so early human spiritual body is not completely established at that point. Originally it was the same for muslims but they have moved it far later when boy is at least 7 to 9 years at earliest and about 12-14 at latest. 
The reptillian&amp;grey is the most complicated point in research because there are simply a lot of absolute fiction &amp; ufology. You should start your study with greys and I guess good entry point for you would be gnostic archons. Reptillians are even more complicated. You should study sumerian culture a bit, you may start  with Zacharia Sitchin as introduction but please take into account that Sitchin translation is the false translation. It just will be a good entry point to overall story. Read about Ouroboros and then go into egyptian ancient mythology. Then there will be a lot of stories of inerbreeding of reptillian with humans at early stages being done in egypt mostly which actually was the reason why jews as egyptian slaves were selected for all this. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wrong. The interest rate is determined by the level of risk associated with the borrower. If there was no reward for lending money no would do it and the rich would be even richer. Im no fan of credit but it does distribute wealth in some way. For example I borrow £10,000 to start a business if that is succesful I end up far better off than if I never had the 10k to start.</p>

<p>What I think you are trying to say is that inflation is needed to repay all of the debt. This is true but this mechanism works because the value of money is decreasing.</p>

<p>Also not all debt is created out of nothing most debt is in the form of bonds. Bonds are purchased with money then the issuer pays interest until maturity when they pay the original amount back. You are thinking of unsecured loans, secured loans and mortgages.</p>

If you want to go directly without any background knowledge then google for &quot;project lucifer cassini&quot; and you will find some articles as old as 2008 but it will sound as nonsense to you if you won&#39;t study the story above.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very interesting, thanks for sharing. </p>

<p>The article I read says that Saturn cannot become a star because</p>

<ol>
<li><p>it is too small to support nuclear fusion</p></li>
<li><p>it is extremely lacking in flammable material for nuclear fusion to occur. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Also 30kg of plutonium (in Cassini, safely organized/separated) is not nearly enough to have any noteworthy impact. There are plenty of naturally occurring explosions and collisions, such as massive comets, that cause nothing close to converting planets to stars.</p>

<p>It seems completely non feasible to me, but I love learning about conspiracies like this one. Luckily we will get to see for ourselves in September if another sun is noticable. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Gas giants have some of the characteristics of brown dwarfs. Like the Sun, Jupiter and Saturn are both made primarily of hydrogen and helium. Saturn is nearly as large as Jupiter, despite having only 30% the mass. Three of the giant planets in the Solar System (Jupiter, Saturn, and Neptune) emit much more heat than they receive from the Sun.[25] And all four giant planets have their own &quot;planetary systems&quot;—their moons. Like stars, brown dwarfs form independently, but lack sufficient mass to &quot;ignite&quot; as do stars. Like all stars, they can occur singly or in close proximity to other stars. Some orbit stars and can, like planets, have eccentric orbits.</p>

<p>The very first bullet point is incorrect. Those designations &quot;slavic, nordic, black, arabic etc.&quot; are just as arbitrary as countries and hold no real meaning.

<p>If your aim is to convince people that the world is not controlled in the manner it&#39;s presented, then I think what the user @lucydaydream is pointing out is that going in with ritual murder of children is likely to get people dismissing you. Despite what you think might be happening with regards to Pizzagate, without proof in terms of convictions or people coming forward to say their child has been eaten by elites and can offer some sort of paper trail then most people will regard it as fiction. </p>

<p>If your aim is to convince people of something then why not start by talking about how is it that there are so many recorded cases of pedophilla that were covered up (former Prime Minster, Ted Heath, and Jimmy Saville to name just two). In my opinion, it would be more effective to get people to agree in small increments. From there you can maybe start to ask them if there&#39;s anything they personally question about what the mainstream narrative tells us. I just think people will switch off and not be &quot;red-pilled&quot; if you go in guns blazing and saying &quot;everything you believe is a lie&quot;. People will just react against that and find it jarring that you&#39;re trying to dismantle everything in which they believe or trust. Obviously, feel free to ignore me and I might very well be wrong and this reaction hasn&#39;t been what you&#39;ve typically experienced when you&#39;ve approached people with similar info.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My intention is different from both. Your example is the desire for change. I do not desire to change anything as anything that happens happens by will of God. If something what happens I do not like that does not mean that it&#39;s going to happen to me or that I should do anything about it. I have simple stated the facts.I do not want to start a revolution of thought or create an army of followers as I am going to die quite soon. Once I die only I will remain with me and nothing else than me matters. Before that I can force people into study but I will never force them into taking sides. Jehovah is as better than Lucifer as Lucifer as better than Jehovar. They are the same  but I am not going into their matter-soul transformation machine. I have my own route in the middle and I do not seek to save nor to doom anyone. For myself there is noone except me but I live for everyone except myself. That&#39;s what I find out after everything I&#39;ve studied.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ultimately yes. It is as you have described. In jewish Kaballah there is a book of Zoar which basically describes that every being goes from -desire to recieve for itself - desire to reject for itself - desire to reject for God - desire to recieve for God. Process of change from creature for creator. That&#39;s how they call it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, that&#39;s cool. I think the &quot;red-pill&quot; terminology to me connotes trying to give something to someone that changes them (in this case, information, rather than an actual pill as in The Matrix). That was my main reason for questioning your tactics as I associate &quot;red pill&quot; with trying giving information to someone with the aim of making them change their minds. I respect your position though. I sometimes wonder why I bother to offer information that might change someone&#39;s mind, I guess it&#39;s because I think that some of the changes could lead to people being kinder to each other and more human.</p>

<p>With regards to Lucifer, is there even a Lucifer in The Bible? From talking to some people I know who studied ancient and medieval history, Lucifer is a mistranslation of something. Isn&#39;t it the morning star and Jesus is also referred to by that title? I was told that &quot;the morning star&quot; referred to a Babylonian king and is used to describe a title, so &quot;morning star&quot; is essentially saying that Jesus is someone who should be considered by people to be of a &quot;worthy&quot; background. I don&#39;t know enough about The Bible, but have you heard that point of view before and would you disagree with it?</p>

<p>I certainly think there is good and evil in the world. Have you seen Jordan Peterson&#39;s lectures on The Bible? He is a Christian, but seems to come from a quite unique position of saying that The Bible is a collection of stories humanity created in order to make sense of the world. You might not agree with him, but I found his ideas quite interesting and helped me to understand why The Bible has had just a lasting and powerful impact</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am not Christian. Bible is not a compilation of human stories but a jewish history created out of middle-eastern historic books and teachings. Lucifer terminology can be applied to a lot of things because it translates as a light-bearer but in my context it means that Lucifer is the idea of light(soul) escaping matter(dark). Red pill was just a context name.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am not Christian. Bible is not a compilation of human stories but a jewish history created out of middle-eastern historic books and teachings.
