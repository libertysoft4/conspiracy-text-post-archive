Ive noticed since that time I had gone downhill a lot to where I am now. 
I am depressed, 100% everyday I cant see the good things this life has to offer any more. I also dont want to stop researching because &#39;once you know, you know&#39;. There is no going back. I am sure some of you have had this, how did you overcome? How do you cope? Any help is welckme! Thank you.</p>

<p>If need be, and please be open to it, visit a psychologist. They do not prescribe medicine but will give you strategies to cope and push forward.</p>

<p>Hope you find inner peace bro. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>if you look of a pack of chimps, you can find documented (albeit infrequent) examples of adult females eating rival infants and bands of male chimps cooperating to literally wipe out competition in their territory. at the same time, the level of compassion that exists within a group from child rearing to food sharing, grooming, play and even education (tool building etc) is remarkable. </p>

<p>to focus only on the cannibalism and genocide would be very depressing, to deny it would be dangerous. I like to think the amount of human compassion in the world is staggering- but it is often not the focus of conspiracy theories or even the evening news, etc. much of it is taken for granted. </p>

<p>Unfortunately though, I can&#39;t help but feel that depression is mostly just another scam to get people on meds. There&#39;s a lot of conditioning going on these days, a lot of methods by which we&#39;re being pushed towards depression and anxiety.</p>

<p>you don&#39;t need a nationally rated blue-ribbon trout stream to have a good time. you can fly fish for any species and you can do it anywhere there are fish.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>spend 45 mins getting the stuff on and ready</p>
</blockquote>

<p>with a little practice and prep, getting your shit on and your line/rod/tackle set up shouldn&#39;t take longer than 10-15 minutes</p>

<p>flyfishing is the both the most skill-based type of fishing, but also the most rewarding and zen-like type of fishing</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Warning: LONG. </p>

<p>There was a time when I felt a little overwhelmed. I started to feel like any effort to do something good would be futile. like I was an insignificant nothing, a grain of sand in a sea of space, too small to change anything about the world, and its thousands of years of power struggles and corruption.</p>

<p>The feeling got me down, but it didn&#39;t sit right. something in me was stirring. I started hearing a melody in my head. that&#39;s not too unusual for me, as a musician...melodies occupy my brain for a good part of the day. but this one in particular kept recurring. it was familiar, but I couldn&#39;t remember what it was from. it kept coming back, and coming back.  </p>

<p>...and it got louder. every time i got down thinking of the world, government, freedom, etc...this melody came back. louder and louder. i was racking my brain trying to place it. I didn&#39;t know what it was. my brain works a little different than some people. if I am really tired, exhausted or stressed, I swear to god, sometimes I can actually <em>hear</em> the music. not just think it, but it has volume. somehow my brain is creating the same exact sensation as hearing music. an auditory hallucination if you will. it happened more when I was younger, always classical music when I went to bed, but as an adult its really rare for it to have volume like that.</p>

<p>whenever Im trying to place a melody, I try super hard to remember the words that go with it, and make them &quot;come out&quot;...if I can get even a phrase, I can just google that, and find it right away...but the words are elusive. one day...I was feeling pretty shit about all this stuff, when this mysterious melody was really strong, swelling up, getting louder and louder...so, I focused really hard, and I finally heard the words...</p>

<p>&quot;Fight For Anything....&quot; </p>

<p>in a rush i seached google, and was in awe as I listened to a song I think I&#39;d heard only a few times before...<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYLE7YTrrto">Megadeth - Fight for Freedom</a></p>

<p>all of the lyrics are profound and related to the common man, the poor, and resistance, revolution, etc. I suggest having a watch of the video, I linked, which has all the lyrics...but for now Ill just post the chorus, which has the phrase I heard.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Fight for freedom, fight authority</p>

<p><strong>Fight for anything</strong>, my country tis&#39; of me </p>
</blockquote>

<p>and thats the story of how I got my username. </p>

<p>a lot of people read my username and think it means fight for anything, as in...anything, like for no reason...just start shit for the sake of starting shit. thats not what Dave Mustain means here. its more...fight for <em>something</em>, anything, no matter how small. maybe you <em>cant</em> overthrow the secret illuminati brotherhood manipulating the world from the shadows all by yourself, but thats how they want you to feel. there ARE things that you can do. what are you going to do? just sit down and die? fuck that. stick it to em. give em hell, man. maybe...maybe, all you can do is little shit. especially at first. dont use banks, your interest makes them rich. keep your info private, they sell that. be smarter than the system, dont let it drain you. if you can see the truth, and can show it to two people, who show it to two people, etc....youve started a domino effect. wars are won on attrition. especially if you are the underdog.</p>

<p>im not sure exactly what you can do, because I dont know who you are. I took me a while to figure me out. im a rabble rouser. I got that job down to a tee. ironically, the key to being a rabble rouser isnt starting shit, (though thats important), the key is knowing what shit to start. I take the high road on ideological issues, and I see through bullshit. I have this polar ability to both be civil, reasonable and logical when trying to sway opinion. i can win debates, and by that, I dont mean yell the loudest, but I mean actually get someone else to change their opinion...that is the true definition of winning a debate....but I also turn into an ideological pitchfork emporium when needed. when the people are ready to burn it all down, im the one handing out torches.</p>

<p>so...thats my gig. thats what I do. it gives me some kind of purpose. im not the leader of a movement, and Ill never be in a history book, but i do my part. I fight for anything.</p>

<p>•Organic multivitamin 1 per day
•Smoking cannabis almost everyday for 5 months
•Praying, I&#39;m Muslim and when I got back to praying it really helped a lot it&#39;s a form of meditation.
•Normal meditation with Om

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry you feel this way, i now how dark it can be at the bottom of a depression.
I have been there a couple of times myself and just as you all those conspiracies did not make it better for me.</p>

<p>Past 8 months i have recoverd from my returning depression and i know it won&#39;t come back anymore. How did i do that, well i was confronted with something that given me a kick in the bud, telling me i should look deeper in the meaning of life and it all.</p>

<p>This drove me into the spriritual side of life, a region i always was slightly interested in but after diving deeper it filled the hole and gave me many insights in myself, the conspiracies and the world we live in, or create i should say.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t mean the origanised religions, i personaly do not resonate with any of them complete, just parts of it. No, i mean the very basics of life, who am i, what am i, where am i, why am i here and so on. These are the important questions and once you are on your path of finding out your truth you are on your way of filling the hole that is causing your depression. That does not mean i am agains religions, everybody is entitled to their own believes.</p>

<p>At the bottom i&#39;ll past two links, one is a seemingly simple cartoon, it has started 5 years ago so don&#39;t let the 2012 links drive you away it will become clear in the next shows. This cartoon is covering it all, from beginning to present and is like a kiddy pool for spirituality, but full of very good and usefull information.
The second one is from a very clever guy, he is able to link many conspiracies to the spiritual side of us and he does a very good job at it.</p>

<p>If you get an understanding of what we all are, energy, frequency and vibration, and what we as human are actualy capable off you are comming over your depression fast. You will come to notice as why these conspiracies have been here and to what means and you will see their whole system is crashing down and their last efforts are almost laugheble.</p>

<p>We are so much stronger than we are led to believe, please try to focus on yourself now. Shutdown the news for a while, they all are telling lies anyway and try to find nature. Just hiking or something else, let your thougts go and try to apreciate all what surrounds you.</p>

<p>We as humanity are on the right track, everything you see in the news is created to get us off the track, well they did it for a long time, but it is our turn now. Once you see it, you will believe it.</p>

<p>One more thing, don&#39;t get the anger, fear, hate and negativety get to you, once you discover some truths those emotions are sure to follow. It is oke that you have them, that is what makes us human, but don&#39;t whallow in, or worse act on them. Notice them and let them go, it will all become clear in the end and negative emotion are slowing down your progress.</p>

<p>I know you have a long journy ahead, and i feel for you. But please don&#39;t ignore your thru inner self, especially not in the beautifull time we are in right now. The time all dark will come to an end and light shall bring us peace.</p>

<p>TheSpiritScience: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/TheSpiritScience">https://www.youtube.com/user/TheSpiritScience</a>, just start at 1, not at 0.</p>

<p>Please give it a try, i know you will have use for it in your life, you just don&#39;t know it for yourself right now, please don&#39;t discard this right away, take a chance with it.</p>

<p>Good luck, have a safe trip, stay well and try to stay as positive as possible and feel free to PM me if you have any questions.</p>

<p>My point is everything looks grim from this perspective. You have to move beyond it. Beyond duality and start searching for the answers of what is this world and universe really. The answers are shocking. Can I suggest reading a book called disappearance of the universe. It really sent me through a loop but it&#39;s a perspective changer for sure. Stay strong. </p>

<p>The buildings did not fall at free fall. The cores collapsed first. Leaving an unsupported shell. </p>

Through these infant eyes you will discover a multitude of daily beauty and wonders you skip over because you have been programmed.  Even if you just sit in your backyard and watch the clouds.  There are so many things you will notice you have never noticed before and you will be shocked that you didnt see these things sooner.</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;action is the antidote to despair&quot; </p>

<p>There is no going back, you&#39;re right. There is no forgetting or pulling a Cypher. So you can either wallow &amp; worry or you can find a way forward(or sideways!). Identify the forces that are working against you and find ways to avoid or counter them and you&#39;ll feel like a superhero instead of trapped. It&#39;s hard as fuck, but there aren&#39;t really any easy options when most of the world is against you. </p>

<p>At times I use escapism but that doesn&#39;t help anything and in fact makes it worse and makes it easier for the shitty momentums to keep steamrolling us. Find healthy ways to ground out your stress. Walking in nature, exercise, cooking, meditation do it for me. </p>

<p>Prepping in various ways that are accessible and relevant to you helps a lot too. Self-sufficiency is empowering and (usually) less expensive that staying hopelessly dependent on failing paradigms. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can relate. </p>

<p>I woke up, read 1984 and took a deep dive into conspiracy. After years of &quot;catching up&quot; I backed off and took a break. I realized that the conspiracy mind set is in of itself a trap. Yes, you learn that the world is not what it seems but it isn&#39;t what the conspiratologists think it is either. </p>

<p>I felt depressed and yet I found that stepping away from the ledge and looking inward was the answer. </p>

<p>Try to look at it this way. The world walks around with blinders you don&#39;t wear anymore. You can&#39;t afford to be paranoid or psychotic. </p>

<p>Once you realize that the world is controlled by fear you can divorce yourself from living in the fear based world and live your life to the fullest. Once you shake off the shackles of fear control you become truly free and that is beautiful. </p>

<p>You are flying above the filth looking down. Sometimes you feel sad for the world but remember that they don&#39;t want to be saved. Remember the Matrix when Morpheus says to Neo, &#39;You have to understand. Most people are not ready to be unplugged. And many of them are so inured and so hopelessly dependent on the system that they will fight to protect it.&#39; This is how people who watch the Today show and listen to the news thinking they are informed feel. </p>

<p>Try to gently reach out and show people some simple truths. Be compassionate. It is like waking someone up gently, a few nudges and wait. </p>

<p>Another good movie quote from Network, Howard Beales:
&quot;So if you want the truth... Go to God! Go to your gurus! Go to yourselves! Because that&#39;s the only place you&#39;re ever going to find any real truth.&quot;</p>
