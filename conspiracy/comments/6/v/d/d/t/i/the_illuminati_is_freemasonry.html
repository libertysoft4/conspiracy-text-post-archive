        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It&#39;s important to understand the common thread that all &quot;NWO&quot; &quot;One World Government&quot; and &quot;Illuminati&quot; theories share: they were invented by Freemasons to cover their tracks. </p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.jesus-is-savior.com/False%20Religions/Illuminati/jbs.htm">John Birch Society</a> was the most important group to popularize these theories. The John Birch Society was controlled by the Belmont Brotherhood, which was <a href="http://watch.pairsite.com/belmont.html">dominated</a> by Scottish Rite Freemasons and members of the Council on Foreign Relations.</p>

<p>These Freemasons peddle the myth that Freemasonry was a noble society that was somehow corrupted by the Illuminati. Of course, the Illuminati is nowhere to be found, so people waste their time searching for a group that disbanded in the 1780s, while ignoring the secret society that exists all over the world and most towns in America!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I&#39;ve always said that. The name &#39;Illuminati&#39; is just a mainstream name they&#39;ve pushed. It&#39;s just a distraction. I mean, there are tons of references in those &#39;Illuminati&#39; theories, because it&#39;s basically Freemason. The symbolism, the idea, the execution. It&#39;s all the same. But people fail to realize that and they just mock. And this was EXACTLY their plan. They knew the internet was becoming available to the public and would soon take over their lives. So they implemented the idea of the &#39;Illuminati&#39; in there to mind-control the average consumer, and at the same time, hide behind a fake name. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Freemasonry and the Illuminati are completely different secret societies. <a href="http://www.carrollquigley.net/Interviews/Carroll_Quigley_1974_Interview_Transcript_Part5.htm">Carroll Quigley</a> stated that the Illuminati was totally separate from Freemasonry:</p>

<p>&quot;QUIGLEY: “But I cannot see any connection between the Masons and the Illuminati,”&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Are you implying, though, that the New World Order doesnt exist?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No. The New World Order was another secret society, to which Washington and several other Founders belonged, which was diametrically opposed to Freemasonry and infiltrated masonry in order to pull of the Revolution.</p>

<p>The Old World Order is what people are opposed to, which the Founders were trying to defeat.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Drawn by Masons and put on the dollar bill by a Mason.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Washington was murdered by Freemasons. Freemasons only murder their own if they are traitors to the craft, which Washington was.</p>

<p>The mason who put the seal on the money was largely opposed to the Old World Order as well. The bankers attempted to assassinate and [overthrow](<a href="http://www.npr.org/2012/02/12/145472726/when-the-bankers-plotted-to-overthrow-fdr">www.npr.org/2012/02/12/145472726/when-the-bankers-plotted-to-overthrow-fdr</a>) FDR. </p>

<p>This <a href="https://periodicpresidents.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/fdr-memorial-statue-wheelchair.png">statue</a> is placed at the date of 1932 on the FDR timeline at his memorial in Washington. If you look closely, those are not glasses (there are no rims), they are opaque. Coins were placed over the eyes of the dead to pay Charon to ferry them across the river Styx. The stone masons who created this memorial are saying that FDR became dead to them in 1932.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks my friend. Whenever the topic of HLI comes upI noticed those who cast aspersions on the anon are only aware of /pol. Most certainly aren&#39;t aware
Of the Alts, nor digested any of the recommended reading or conducted further research. I thought presenting the sum total of my experience across all the platforms I&#39;ve had them, might make for a more comprehensive portrayal.</p>

<p>People need to know that there&#39;s something coming. Even though the vast majority will doubt, it&#39;s important that the message is out there, right? . I&#39;m past doubts and concern on the credibility of Three:HLI- the data is too composite.. too compelling. </p>

<p>We will be the generation who terraform mars, extend our lifespans indefinitely and finally break free of this Mind-prison that contained our god given potential. </p>

<p>&quot;Some revisionist authors have suggested that the Catholic Church is the controller of the Masonic conspiracy through the Jesuit Order. There are several reasons for this viewpoint: (1) the Jesuits preceded organized Freemasonry by almost two centuries; (2)  like  Masons  the  Jesuits  have  several  degrees  of  initiation;  (3)  like  Masons  the  Jesuits  take  an  oath;  (4)  like  Masons  the  Jesuits  have  in  the  past  subverted  governments; (5) Jesuits have surfaced in Freemasonry; (6) Jesuits were encouraged and  protected  by  Freemason  Frederick  the  Great  during  their  suppression  in  1773; and (7) Weishaupt was at one time a Jesuit.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The freemasons started as a way to pass along knowledge, mainly the 7 sacred sciences. Adam was taught by God in the garden of eden, who taught Cain, who then taught Enoch. They were not supposed to use the 7 sacred sciences for evil, but they did and corrupted them in defiance to God, probably with help from the Nephilim. Enoch put all of his writings in vaults that survived the flood. IIRC, the freemasons started before the flood and managed to pass their knowledge to the posdeluvian world. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>According to Bill Cooper&#39;s Mystery Babylon:</p>

<p>The following is the chain of creation:</p>

<p>Alumbrados =&gt; Jesuits =&gt; Bavarian Illuminati</p>

<p>Freemasonry already existed when the Knights Templar found refuge in the lodges.</p>

<p>The Bavarian Illuminati infiltrated Freemasonry.  Freemasons already had knowledge of the mysteries from the Knights Templar influence.  Not sure about Freemasonry in the beginning but they are now just different secret societies that all worship Lucifer once you reach the highest degrees of initiation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s an excellent series, and Bill Cooper is the man. The Bavarian Illuminati did infiltrate Freemasonry, but the Freemasons were the evil ones, not so much the Illuminati.</p>

<p>The Illuminati was a project by American intelligence (Washington and Franklin), to make the American Revolution look like a Masonic revolution. It was not; it was a real revolution. Which is why Freemasons killed George Washington, and have been fighting to undermine America ever since.</p>
