        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><strong>TLDR- Per Pakistani sites, a Pakistani AF officer named Mohammed Akram Awan was jailed in 1988 for acting as a Mossad double agent and helping to kill Pakistan&#39;s President and 31 others in a plane crash. We know that Imran Awan&#39;s father has the same name. Are they the same person? Or related somehow?</strong></p>

<p><em>Implications- At the very most we learn a possible reason the Awans have the power they do in DC. At the very least we are educated about an assassination of a foreign leader and US diplomats by a Mossad double agent, and the US State Dept having no interest in investigating.</em></p>

<p>I found this a while back when researching Seth Rich and it needs attention. There&#39;s a mention on a Pakistani defense forum site about a Mohammed Akram Awan, an ex-Pakistani Air Force officer who was jailed for espionage as a Mossad double agent that planted a device in a PK plane to bring it down in 1988. It happened to be the crash that killed the President of Pakistan. Those in the forum don&#39;t seem to know what ever happened to him after he was jailed. <em>Did he possibly relocate to the US with his family?</em></p>

<p>3rd post down on this forum:</p>

<p>More details on the crash at sites below- READ THIS, HOLY SHIT. Awan is discussed in the bottom 4 paragraphs. Also, the American ambassador to India at the time presented his Mossad involvement theory to the State Dept and was declared mentally unfit and relieved of his duties. There was never an FBI investigation despite American diplomats being killed.</p>

<p><em>Is Mohammed Akram Awan a relative of Imran, possibly father, uncle, cousin?</em> A popular background check site says that an Imran Awan living in a D.C. suburb is indeed related to a Mohammed Akram Awan who also has a D.C. suburb address AND a Jamal Awan (can&#39;t post the link bc doxxing), if these are all the right people.</p>

<p><a href="http://i.magaimg.net/img/18l4.jpg">http://i.magaimg.net/img/18l4.jpg</a></p>

<p>The below site has info suggesting that Akram Awan was sentenced to 14 years in prison in 1998. Where is he now? Did he get paroled early? His fate seems a mystery.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Could be a very interesting find. The only thing that seems to be missing is a solid connection between Mohammed Akram Awan and Imran Awan. I know that you said a background site says they may be related but that isn&#39;t exactly conclusive proof, and I have actually been unable to find any such site that does say this.</p>

<p>How common of a last name is &quot;Awan?&quot; Is it like a &quot;Smith or &quot;Johnson&quot; type of name that millions of people have? If so, this could just be a coincidence. Going to have to do some more digging to see if there is actually a connection here. But good work OP. As you suggest, this is definitely worth looking into. If a solid link between Mohammed Akram and Imran is found then there could be some interesting implications.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Awan is quite a common name but Akram is not as common- when I saw this on the forum I started digging and was blown away at the conspiracies surrounding that event in 1988 which might explain WHY the Awans have so much pull in Washington. </p>

<p>Hope this is censored enough.</p>

<p>The other thing is that supposedly Imran Awan&#39;s dad changed his name after his crimes started so who knows what his old/new name was or how accurate the background check site is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the additional info. So it seems like while &quot;Awan&quot; may be common &quot;Akram Awan&quot; is not common. So it is like he is named &quot;Tiberius Smith&quot; rather than &quot;John Smith.&quot; That should make him easier to pinpoint assuming he hasn&#39;t changed his name.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Or nothing? Using the comment above yours as an example, Tiberius smith and john smith could he father-son, uncle-nephew, brothers or not related at all, I&#39;m not trying to throw shade on your theory it seems very well thought out and researched, but you should be researching to find the correct conclusion, not researching to support a conclusion you personally prefer. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not arguing that they&#39;re not related, I don&#39;t know either way and your post is the first i&#39;ve read about this theory, so for all i know really did find a very real connection, but it&#39;s hard to get into theories that seem to start with a conclusion and everything after that is cherry picked to support that conclusion. It hurts the brain to be told what I should think after I see all the evidence before I&#39;m shown the evidence....</p>

<p>An easy real-world example to point to would be how some feel about the Russia election meddling theory. some feel the conclusion that trump must have been involved came first and then all research done after that was only to support that conclusion, ignoring the possibility that Russia could have meddled without any help from trump or his campaign. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Source - Liberty News and Views, on Facebook
On Thursday February 2, 2017 three brothers from Pakistan, shared IT employees of dozens of Congressional members, Imran, Abid and Jamal Awan, along with two of their wives were banned from accessing the Congressional Network when it was discovered that they had been accessing sensitive data without authorization. They also took more than twenty blackberry and laptop devises from the offices of Congress members. Over 80 total members of congress employed them for IT services, including members if the Intelligence and Foreign Affairs Committees. Additional scrutiny revealed even more disturbing details.
Investigations revealed that the devices they worked on were networked to synch together continuously, giving the Awan Brothers unimpeded access to everything on all the devices, including email communications and classified documents.
The brothers owned 12 homes and multiple businesses. An emergency call to police in Fairfield County,VA was placed from one of those homes by Samani Galani, their stepmother who told police she was being held prisoner by the three men. The brothers refused to allow her to visit her husband in the hospital and were demanding that she give them access to their father&#39;s offshore assets or they would kidnap and kill her relatives in Pakistan. The brothers were fired by all of their Congressional employers except for Gregory Meeks and Debbie Wasserman Schultz who promoted Imran to the position of &#39;advisor.&#39;
That is about the extent of what has been reported in Main Stream News sources, but it is really just the beginning of the story.
Blackberries. They are not new technology, and nearly extinct among the population, except in Washington, D.C. In D.C. on the hill, they are everywhere. HRC used one, Huma Abedin, Deborah Wasserman Schultz (DWS) even Obama used a blackberry. It was Time, as George says, for &#39;Mr. Smith to go to Washington.&#39; This is a reference to an old movie, he uses a lot of those as well as Shakespeare quotes, which adds to his charm. To report the process of connecting the dots in detail would make this article dissertation length, so much more will be left out than will be included. A key element arose when discovering HRC&#39;s refusal to use the nearly bomb proof, secure phone provided by the NSA, came to light. In an email to Abedin, HRC asks that she have one of Anthony&#39;s &#39;trusted staff&#39; bring over one of the special secured blackberries.
More references to &#39;Anthony&#39;s trusted staff&#39; were found and they were eventually identified as the Awan brothers, and a whole new branch of inquiry emerged leading to the Mother Of All Rabbit-holes.
If you are like me and want to see the meticulous piecing together of all the strands, you shouldn&#39;t miss George Webb&#39;s blow by blow video diary of his investigation on his youtube channel. Its like watching a tapestry being woven and seeing the picture emerge. It is truly vast, but the most crucial section of the big picture at the moment are the Awan brothers and the critical danger they still pose to all of us.
The D.C. Capitol Police have opened an investigation into the Awans for accessing classified information without authorization, for burglary and for theft of the nearly two dozen &#39;thin clients&#39; as the blackberries and laptops are called. But it goes much deeper than that. Those of us who have followed George&#39;s journey have seen the supporting evidence or testimony along the way, but please investigate for yourselves when you understand where this is going to take us.
The data indicates that the people involved are implicated in many misdeeds and the synopsis I describe is setting forth the theory of what the data shows, as a result of our crowd-sourced, savant-led investigation. We have no authority to conduct an official investigation, reach official conclusions or to issue indictments, but if the authorities say they are having trouble uncovering the truth, we have taken away that excuse. So follow closely. We start with the DNC leaks.
One of the citizen investigators who is also a citizen journalist was contacted by a person in the same sort of position as Seth Rich was in and that person gave our member a thumb drive that appears to come from NGP VAN, the data contractor for the Democrats during the 2016 election. That is just one of the sources that inform the emerging fact pattern. Crowd Strike, the contractor that James Comey described as examining the DNC system instead of the FBI, was on site for at least six weeks during the election as well. On the thumb drive we received, are files which actually describe in power points the tactics used to fix the primary election. There are several elements involved, one had to do with duplicates on the voter rolls, and falsely generating duplicates of voters which the NGP VAN database indicated were Bernie Sanders voters. The system would show them as having already voted and their vote would be purged from the system. That&#39;s just one of the tactics uncovered.
Data was being downloaded during daily backups which caused a window of 4 hours according to more than one source from inside the DNC, in which the firewalls were down and data across the entire network became accessible. Seth Rich was disturbed by the election tampering as a Bernie supporter. Metadata indicates he was collecting not just election files but email files as well up until the end of May which is the last recorded date on the DNC/Podesta emails in the Wikileaks emails.
HRC and DWS, using the Awan brothers, distributed blackberries and laptops to democratic Congress Members and members of the DNC in order to have a party-centric communication platform. These were &#39;doped&#39; to synchronize, likely without the user even knowing it in most cases. Through this process, the Awan brothers became aware of the data downloads taking place during the DNC back ups and the HRC Campaign and the DNC brass became aware of the leaks. This is when we see the famous Podesta email where he discusses &#39;making an example&#39; of a leaker.
Over the next few months, the Awan brothers intercepted attempts to transfer data to Wikileaks and stopped them. They missed at least one and maybe two that probably went out on the Memorial Day holiday or soon afterward. This set in motion Bill Clinton&#39;s June 30th meeting with Loretta Lynch on the tarmac, because the HRC camp knew the emails were going to come out, and they had to get ahead of it.
Up until that point, the mumblings were that nothing was turning up in the FBI&#39;s investigation of HRC, but after discovering the successful transfer to Wikileaks, they knew damaging information was going to come out. The FBI would be implicated if their investigation supposedly had turned up nothing when the evidence was released.</p>

    <p class="byline text-muted mb-0"><a href="javascript:;" class="score"><span class="badge badge-secondary">1</span></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/thewordwolf.html">thewordwolf</a> 2017-08-23</p>
    <div class="md"><p>Source - Liberty News and Views, on Facebook</p>

<p>On Thursday February 2, 2017 three brothers from Pakistan, shared IT employees of dozens of Congressional members, Imran, Abid and Jamal Awan, along with two of their wives were banned from accessing the Congressional Network when it was discovered that they had been accessing sensitive data without authorization. They also took more than twenty blackberry and laptop devises from the offices of Congress members. Over 80 total members of congress employed them for IT services, including members if the Intelligence and Foreign Affairs Committees. Additional scrutiny revealed even more disturbing details.</p>

<p>Investigations revealed that the devices they worked on were networked to synch together continuously, giving the Awan Brothers unimpeded access to everything on all the devices, including email communications and classified documents.</p>

<p>The brothers owned 12 homes and multiple businesses. An emergency call to police in Fairfield County,VA was placed from one of those homes by Samani Galani, their stepmother who told police she was being held prisoner by the three men. The brothers refused to allow her to visit her husband in the hospital and were demanding that she give them access to their father&#39;s offshore assets or they would kidnap and kill her relatives in Pakistan.
The brothers were fired by all of their Congressional employers except for Gregory Meeks and Debbie Wasserman Schultz who promoted Imran to the position of &#39;advisor.&#39;</p>

<p>That is about the extent of what has been reported in Main Stream News sources, but it is really just the beginning of the story.</p>

<p>Blackberries. They are not new technology, and nearly extinct among the population, except in Washington, D.C. In D.C. on the hill, they are everywhere. HRC used one, Huma Abedin, Deborah Wasserman Schultz (DWS) even Obama used a blackberry. It was Time, as George says, for &#39;Mr. Smith to go to Washington.&#39; This is a reference to an old movie, he uses a lot of those as well as Shakespeare quotes, which adds to his charm.
To report the process of connecting the dots in detail would make this article dissertation length, so much more will be left out than will be included.
A key element arose when discovering HRC&#39;s refusal to use the nearly bomb proof, secure phone provided by the NSA, came to light. In an email to Abedin, HRC asks that she have one of Anthony&#39;s &#39;trusted staff&#39; bring over one of the special secured blackberries.</p>

<p>More references to &#39;Anthony&#39;s trusted staff&#39; were found and they were eventually identified as the Awan brothers, and a whole new branch of inquiry emerged leading to the Mother Of All Rabbit-holes.</p>

<p>If you are like me and want to see the meticulous piecing together of all the strands, you shouldn&#39;t miss George Webb&#39;s blow by blow video diary of his investigation on his youtube channel. Its like watching a tapestry being woven and seeing the picture emerge. It is truly vast, but the most crucial section of the big picture at the moment are the Awan brothers and the critical danger they still pose to all of us.</p>

<p>The D.C. Capitol Police have opened an investigation into the Awans for accessing classified information without authorization, for burglary and for theft of the nearly two dozen &#39;thin clients&#39; as the blackberries and laptops are called. But it goes much deeper than that. Those of us who have followed George&#39;s journey have seen the supporting evidence or testimony along the way, but please investigate for yourselves when you understand where this is going to take us.</p>

<p>The data indicates that the people involved are implicated in many misdeeds and the synopsis I describe is setting forth the theory of what the data shows, as a result of our crowd-sourced, savant-led investigation. We have no authority to conduct an official investigation, reach official conclusions or to issue indictments, but if the authorities say they are having trouble uncovering the truth, we have taken away that excuse. So follow closely. We start with the DNC leaks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The events on the following time line are well established and widely reported facts.
•On July 5th James Comey calls his famous press release.
•On July 6th Joe Capone, the manager of Lou&#39;s Bar, where Seth Rich liked to hang out, is on the visitor&#39;s roster at the White House, checking in at 12:00 pm and checking out at 11:59 pm.
•On July 8th Congress is shut down. During this time the Awan brothers remove nearly two dozen thin clients from congressional offices, although their identity was not yet known.
•On July 9th Seth Rich is at Lou&#39;s Bar until 1:45am on July 10th speaking with Joe Capone.
•At 4:19am, police are summoned by the shot spotter system to the intersection of Flagler and W streets where they find Seth Rich shot twice in the back, but still alive.
•Shortly after 5am the FBI posts a $10,000 reward for information regarding an FBI SUV broken into near where Seth was found, from which a secure radio and a firearm lockbox are stolen. 
•July 12, Congress is again shut down, during which time the routers on the system that received the synchronized data from the blackberries and laptops are changed out. 
•The Awan brothers have returned to Pakistan. It is unknown why they were allowed to leave in spite of being under investigation. 
•May 24, 2017 In a formal meeting, which was taped, Debbie Wasserman Schultz demands that the Chief of the Capitol Police Department return a laptop to her that was seized from Imran Awan in the ongoing investigation into the Awan brothers unauthorized access of confidential Congressional information.</p>

<p>DWS insists the laptop is her property, twice threatens to cut his budget and when he still declines to return it until the investigation is complete she threatens him with consequences.</p>

<p>•May 25, 2017 Federal Prosecutor Beranton J. Whisenant Jr. , a U.S. Attorney in the Florida district represented by Deborah Wasserman Schultz
washed up on the beach with a tramautic wound to the back of the head. Whisenant worked in the Immigration Division and was currently investigating cases involving Immigration Visa Fraud.</p>

<p>For example Seth gives a different address at the hospital than police list in their report. The police dismiss it as a previous address even though it is only ten minutes from Lou&#39;s Bar, and both Shawn Lucas and Eric Braverman lived a few doors away.</p>

<p>Then there is the strange account given by the emergency room Dr., and the strange connections between the attending physician and the Podestas.
The MPD hasn&#39;t released any information, not even the autopsy report. Normally autopsy reports are routinely released in murder cases in D.C.
In every previous communication from the family they were grateful for assistance in this investigation, until suddenly they had a family spokesman after Rod Wheeler&#39;s report on Fox news came out.</p>

<p>The spokesman, Brad Bauman is a democratic party PR professional specializing in crisis management who has done work for the DNC in the past, but claims the DNC is not compensating him for representing the Rich family.
Heather Podesta, ex-wife of Tony Podesta, John Podesta&#39;s brother is on the Board of Directors of the Washington D.C. Metropolitan Police Department.
Media sources like CNN, ABC and the Washington Post are characterizing the information presented in this article with very grandiose terms of derision, unwarranted in consideration of the nature of Seth Rich&#39;s death, and the surrounding circumstances.</p>

<p>From the Conservapedia page on the Awan Scandal -</p>

<p><em>On March 1, 2017, Daily Caller reported members of the Awan family were paid $5 million by Democratic congressmen over several years, many of whom serve on the Intelligence, Homeland Security and Foreign Affairs Committees.</em></p>

<p><em>Current members who paid the Awan&#39;s are Marcia Fudge, Tim Ryan, Jim Costa, Sander M. Levin, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Yvette D. Clarke, Gregory W. Meeks,[18] John P. Sarbanes, Jackie Speier, Diana DeGette, Frederica S. Wilson, Cedric L. Richmond, David Loebsack, Karen Bass, Joyce Beatty, Emanuel Cleaver, Lois Frankel, Daniel T. Kildee, Tony Cardenas, Michelle Lujan Grisham, Robin L. Kelly, Katherine M. Clark, Mark Takano, Julia Brownley, Pete Aguilar, Andre Carson, Joaquin Castro, Ted Deutch, Ted Lieu, Hakeem S. Jeffries, Kyrsten Sinema and Tammy Duckworth. The Awans had full access to the emails and office computer files of members. Focus of the investigation by the US Capitol Police is an off-site server on which congressional data was loaded.</em></p>

<p><em>There are more than 15,000 congressional staff on Capitol Hill; four of the 500 highest-paid House staffers are Awans. Median salary for legislative assistants is $43,000 annually; Imran Awan has collected $1.2 million in salary since 2010,[19] and his brother Abid and wife Hina Alvi were each paid more than $1 million. Imran first came to Capitol Hill in 2004 and Abid joined him in 2005. Imran’s wife Hina Alvi was added to the payroll in 2007, while Abid’s wife, Natalia Sova, appeared in 2011. In 2014 the youngest brother, Jamal, was added to the payroll in 2014 at the age of 20 with a salary of $160,000, roughly three times the average staff salary.</em></p>

<p><em>The brothers spent significant time in Pakistan.</em></p>

<p>0Hour is speculating that DWS may have been recruited via statecraft (a love tryst) with Imran. Pakistani intelligence has deep ties with... well, all kinds of people. Think Mossad/CIA, but also KGB. I&#39;m wonderinf if any connections to Soros/Euromaidan/Orange Revolution. Seems to be some deepening ties between Ukraine and Pakistani military/contracting. I dunno.</p>

<p>Here we see Pakistan again... this has figured largely in Trump&#39;s revised Afganistan/Pakistan/Asia rebooting announcement. Deep hole with connections between the MIC/Democrats, and the whole long history of Mujahadeen, UBL, Pakistan, Afganistan, CIA drug/gun running...</p>
