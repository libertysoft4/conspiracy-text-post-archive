<p>Seriously. What the hell? </p>

<p>Then they&#39;re denying the incident even happened about the guy stabbed by someone who wanted to hurt a nazi, but the guy wasn&#39;t a nazi and he just had a certain haircut? </p>

<p><a href="http://www.cbs8.com/story/36202522/man-shaken-after-hes-viciously-stabbed-over-haircut-similar-to-neo-nazis">http://www.cbs8.com/story/36202522/man-shaken-after-hes-viciously-stabbed-over-haircut-similar-to-neo-nazis</a></p>

<p>Why is this allowed? They&#39;re advocating violence against &quot;nazis&quot; and then labeling anyone who stands in their way as a &quot;nazi&quot;? It&#39;s ridiculous. </p>

<p>I thought reddit banned hate subreddits?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean if we&#39;re going to ban <a href="/r/fatpeoplehate">/r/fatpeoplehate</a>, this should also be banned. Because this is way worse than hating on fat people. This is stirring up political extremism, on both sides. </p>

<p>It&#39;s inconsistent policy by reddit. And it shows they have a clear bias to protect certain kind of hate speech. That place is a hatred echochamber. There&#39;s like 1000 neo-nazis in the US, yet these people are thinking they&#39;re <em>actually</em> going to interact with some, and they&#39;ll also punch them. To the point where a guy got stabbed because some crazy person ran with that storyline. The TV media is just as guilty about stirriing up this extremism. </p>

<p>But if you&#39;re going to ban subs that foment hatred and extremism, why not be consistent about it? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, just a concerned citizen I guess...</p>

<p>Well, Reddit is owned by a private corporation which is allowed to run thier property as they see fit, and you agreed to thier terms and conditions when you made your account.  Perhaps the people who run Reddit think Nazis suck, and are willing to look the other way when people talk about wanting to punch Nazis.  </p>

<p>I guess the easiest solution is just dont be a nazi, or any other type of racist.</p>

<p>Our actions are limited only by the laws of physics. Yes, you certainly can punch Nazis. You can also shoot, bomb, incinerate, decapitate, or bury them alive. Just ask my grandpa, an accomplished Nazi-killer in his day.
But don&#39;t forget Newton&#39;s 3rd Law: the application of any force produces an equal and opposite reaction force. The consequences for punching people on the street typically involve criminal charges and jail time.</p>

<hr/>

<p>All I&#39;m saying:</p>

<p>I recognize, on an intellectual level, that it is bad to use physical violence against someone for expressing an opinion.</p>

<p>On the other hand, <em>literally everything</em> in my cultural upbringing screams that it&#39;s okay to punch Nazis.</p>

<p>Indian Jones.</p>

<p>Captain America.</p>

<p>Superman.</p>

<p>Wonder Woman.</p>

<p>If literally any heroic pop-cultural figure occupies the same space as a Nazi, <em>that Nazi is getting punched.</em></p>

<p>This is part of Western culture! And by god, isn&#39;t the entirety of the alt-right based on <em>preserving</em> that very culture?!</p>

<p>Richard Spencer should be <em>applauding</em> that brave man for punching him in the face! Violence against Nazis has been a mainstay of Western culture for as long as there have been Nazis!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, he recognised &quot;on an intellectual level&quot; the realities of violence, and went on to try and make a humorous point based on pop culture and Richard Spencer&#39;s views. So, again, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s frothing hatemongering, but at the same time I&#39;m sure there&#39;s quite a few immature types in that sub who would advocate endless violence without thinking it through.

    <div class="md"><p>So, what would you like for the nazi&#39;s? To have the same freedoms as everyone else? Why? That totally goes against what the nazi&#39;s stand for, which is to suppress any groups that they feel are not in their interest. If it&#39;s fair for the nazi&#39;s, it&#39;s fair for everyone else. Also, nazi&#39;s rounded up citizens, put them in prisons and murdered people en masse. I don&#39;t think they believe in free speech. So, yeah, punch those guys, because what they&#39;ll do to you or your neighbors is really incomparable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you&#39;re saying that if neo-nazism isn&#39;t nipped in the bud, hate and nazism will infect a lot of people like cancer, right?</p>

<p>No offense, but I think that&#39;s a bad analogy for a couple of reasons. First, neo-nazism and hate speech has been around for a long time, yet hate groups have tiny numbers and will probably continue to have tiny numbers. Second, you have little faith in Americans&#39; ability to distinguish right and wrong. Education is like the body&#39;s immune system, and hate is the disease. Educating people is the best way to ensure that people who listen to hate speech reject it. </p>

<p>They lie, they deny. I got in an argument with one the other day... he tried to argue that &quot;goy&quot; is not deragatory, <a href="http://archive.is/aNp5i">and he tried to BS out of it</a>.</p>

<p>Then the other day some schizophrenic moron tried to argue with my claim <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/6vcdun/why_does_everyone_hate_google_suddenly/dm016te/?context=3">over google actively censoring/manipulating results</a>.</p>

<p>Not to mention when I dealt with another &quot;Anti Nazi&quot; obsessed sub &quot;Shit Wehraboos Say&quot; <a href="http://archive.is/LqJnr">here in a discussion</a> where I was actually able to objectively prove someone wrong over a Nazi claim. History is filled with arbitrary details, it&#39;s so rare when you can objectively prove someone wrong, and the morons wouldn&#39;t even admit it.</p>

<p>The censorship/shilling is real. It&#39;s extremely bad. The &quot;anti Nazis&quot; are worse than the actual Nazis ever were, and are far far worse than ironic (peaceful) Nazi LARP trolls.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>REddit censorship is a thing, for sure but you&#39;re right.  </p>

<p>A better pursuit, IMO, is to simply recognize that this place, along with every other social media outlet (save for the chans), search engine is totally overrun with censors.  Then the next question becomes </p>

<p>&quot;What can we do to solve this problem and ensure that our speech cannot be regulated by private industry for political gain?&quot;</p>

<p>IMO, we have to build free speech into the bones of any platform we have, we have to make free speech and anti-censorship popular, and we need products that specifically market their product based on their ability to ensure these goals.</p>

<p>The national duscussion, for example, should not be about goddamn &quot;Nazis&quot;.  It should be about speech.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a weird dynamic ultimately.  It’s like the state saying that killing is wrong, yet going ahead and putting someone to death for a crime that person committed.  There aren’t too many people who, peaceful as they may otherwise be, would argue against the death penalty for certain proven criminals under at least <em>certain</em> circumstances.</p>

<p>In this case, racism is wrong.  Division is self-defeating in that it makes the whole of a people and a society weaker.  In that sense, I would not argue against those fighting against racism; those fighting against others who advocate stratification and division in society (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6v4q1x/antifas_website_tells_its_supporters_2_stab_trump/dlxn51e/">don’t get it confused, however</a>).  That said (and as the link intimates), even though I personally feel racism <em>should</em> be fought against, I&#39;m not sure that what Antifa has been made to be is really the way to go either.</p>

There was a thread recently showing the guy that merely wanted to talk to ANTIFA but got yelled at, called a nazi, assaulted, and then HE got arrested.
A few commenters stated that fighting nazis and the alt-right needs to increase, and include shooting them if the alt-right increases in influence. They also said anyone who supports trump or is against the violence or merely appears to be defending the alt-right needs to be taught against and put down because they are racist white supremacist sympathizers. 
Another commenter was just like really? You are for violence against people who disagree with you? And man, it was crazy the way the leftist supporters found ways to justify hate, violence, and even murder. </p>

<p>That&#39;s what they are doing already! The media blares their propaganda 24/7. Social movements, whether good or bad for whomever, need visibility. They need to be public to rally for support. And that will not be allowed to happen. </p>

<p>Yes. </p>

<p>Allowing for a platform allows for that growth, as I explained in my last comment. </p>

<p>Do we have any definitive statistics to say, the KKK had XYZ number of new members to point to? No. But when you understand how herd psychology works, and how the dumbing down of America has played out over the past how many years, critical thinking is something a believe to be rather lacking. Donald Trump won on a platform of sexism and racism. This should tell you something. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t disagree that the support these white nationalists have is extremely overemphasized, but seeing is believing. People see this shit played on TV as a legitimate viewpoint and then join up. Is it reality? No.  But people go out and MAKE IT reality. And that will not be allowed to happen. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hating on people who want attention, only gives them more attention. Same reason the Kardashians are popular. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>No. The Kardashians are largely popular for a whole other set of reasons. Consumer culture, idolization, status obsession, portrayal of bourgeois culture, the leisure class and pecuinary emulation, etc. Sure, people may hate them, but there is a lot more going on that make them less than equivalent  comparison. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you want a movement to die, you ignore it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Maybe in the past, this may have been the case. But this shit has gone mainstream.  </p>

<p>You think if you ignore the shitty songs they play on the radio 24/7, those are going to go away?</p>

<p>You need to look at this from a much broader sociological perspective. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you fight it, it just gives it the appearance of legitimacy and power, which is currently does not have. </p>

<p>Trump won on a platform of racism and sexism. He helped legitimize it. And we will un-legitimize it. By any means neccessary. </p>

<p>We don&#39;t have the luxury of ignoring it anymore. </p>

<p>The middle-class didn&#39;t emerge until after WWII. Things are merely setting back to where they were before. The middle-class is merely the consumer base. They buy the goods and services that float the base of our economy. But there is something else you should be looking at. The ever decreasing cost of labour for increased profits for the corporaocracy, and the war economy. </p>

<p>Neoliberalism. Austerity. World Bank IMF loans etc. And the big one is that the military industrial complex is running out of countries to conquer. I count maybe 4 remaining? Iran, North Korea, Cuba, and Venezuela. (But this is just part of the grander plan.) Bottom line is, if you have a war economy, and an economy that thrives on cheap labour, and the every increasing need for capital accumulation, sale of consumer goods in the never ending <em>race to the bottom,</em> how do you make money if nearly everyone is at peace? Take a look at US Foreign Policy.  Here&#39;s a good breakdown: </p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/48Kw74c.jpg">https://i.imgur.com/48Kw74c.jpg</a></p>

<p>And although you may disagree with what i am about to say next, the CIA funds a lot more if these terrorist extremist groups than you might realize. Hell, by all accounts ISIS is just another one of their manifestations;  Manufactured to serve a great many different purposes, one of which is continued fear and social control in the general population. But we&#39;ll leave that aside for now. </p>

<p>So, yeah. The dying middle class is probably the last thing that should be on your mind when you talk about &quot;root causes&quot; of extremism. </p>

<p>The death of the middle-class certainly reveals some problems, considering the  economic system being employed has come to almost exclusively rely on them to function, but yeah. </p>

<p>Economic inequality is a natural byproduct of capitalism, and it will continue to grow until we are all serfs- indentured servants all over again. Feudalism 2.0. Yee fucking haw. </p>

<p>People are just pointing the finger in the wrong direction. It&#39;s always just been about <strong>class conflict,</strong> everything else is just a smoke screen. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Class conflict, frequently referred to as class warfare or class struggle, is the tension or antagonism which exists in society due to competing socioeconomic interests and desires between people of different classes. The view that the class struggle provides the lever for radical social change for the majority is central to the work of Karl Marx and the anarchist Mikhail Bakunin.</p>

<p>Class conflict can take many different forms: direct violence, such as wars fought for resources and cheap labor; indirect violence, such as deaths from poverty, starvation, illness or unsafe working conditions; coercion, such as the threat of losing a job or the pulling of an important investment; or ideologically, such as with books and articles. Additionally, political forms of class conflict exist; legally or illegally lobbying or bribing government leaders for passage of desirable partisan legislation including labor laws, tax codes, consumer laws, acts of congress or other sanction, injunction or tariff. The conflict can be direct, as with a lockout aimed at destroying a labor union, or indirect, as with an informal slowdown in production protesting low wages by workers or unfair labor practices by capital.</p>

<p>My impression was that you were saying the dying middle-class was the root-cause of  extremism. My apologies. (I was thinking in strictly &quot;international terror cells&quot; type of extremism the media loves to portray.) I suppose this is partially true in regards to the white nationalist idiots blaming immigrants and other exploited peoples for the loss of their jobs, loss of perceived status, etc. and then driving a car into a crowd of Antifa protestors. :(</p>

<p>But then the loss of middle-class is easily replaceable as <strong>any kind of loss</strong> in regards to the ability to fulfill ones needs eg. Procure goods, a &quot;good&quot; job, a home, land, etc. or more generally, the ability to achieve the &quot;American dream.&quot; </p>

<p>But yeah. Class is what we <em>should</em> be talking about. And we will again, once this shit show is over. And we know that the elite will do anything they can to stop that from happening. eg. Frame Nazism as Socialism all over again. Take control of the internet and the narratives. Limit the debate. Etc.</p>

<p>No. Any opposition works. Some better than others. </p>

<p>We don&#39;t want to have to hurt anyone.  Leftists are naturally pacifists. But the use of force and authority is not the same as the institution of force and authority itself. Eg. Hierarchicy.</p>

<p>Bullshit. We simple won&#39;t allow for the concessions made my social movements, civil rights movements, women&#39;s movements, <strong>things that people have fought and died for</strong> to disappear.</p>

<p>The <strong>scapegoats</strong> are the Mexicans, the immigrants, the blacks, yellows, browns, the poor, the marginalized</p>

<p>White power talking their false conscious bullshit behind closed doors is one thing, but if they make their shit public and try to rally more to their cause, they will be opposed. </p>

<p>The trap is the promotion of nonviolence. </p>

<p>The whole Gandhi nonviolent bullshit is just that. Bullshit. You should research how India actually achieved its independence. </p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhagat_Singh">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhagat_Singh</a></p>

<p>Dude, I used to believe the same things you do now. Less than 10 years ago. But when you start digging a little deeper you understand how deep the rabbit hole goes in regards to the norms, values, and beliefs that society holds as sacred, and the things we are told that just aren&#39;t so.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Talking to you is like talking to a brick wall.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You keep pointing the finger at me but it&#39;s actually you, comrade. The belief in nonviolence is so engrained that you can&#39;t even hear what I&#39;m saying to you. </p>

<p>For some reason you think I want to be in violent confrontation. I don&#39;t. </p>

<p>I simply understand when it is neccessary and when it isn&#39;t. </p>

<p>You are of the belief that violence is never the answer. </p>

<p>Yet violent oppression is what we are faced with every single day in this society. </p>

<p>Just because it tends to be implicit rather than explicit doesn&#39;t make it any less true, or any less relevant to oppose. It is ubiquitous. </p>

<p>Keep digging comrade. You&#39;ll get there. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am right there with ya&#39;. Bread and circuses, I suppose. The trouble with this is that because it is being force fed to us, people are inclined to think about which &quot;side&quot; they are on and it only serves to further the divide among us. </p>

<p>I will say though that I am not so sure this type of thing actually favors the billionaires either. Constant political strife shouldn&#39;t be good for the economy as whole, but maybe it is since the Dow Jones seems to be doing quite well through all of it. I mean, I don&#39;t think Trump is any sort of darling among the conservative billionaire class. The Koch Brothers didn&#39;t back him and all of his advisory panel members quit on him.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what to say beyond things are just fucked up right now. I think we just have too many people and we are gobbling up resources across the globe at such a rate that there is just no way it&#39;s sustainable.

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s the same question I&#39;ve been asking myself. I made a subreddit that has 1400 subscribers at <a href="/r/magnora7">/r/magnora7</a>. But now I feel like I&#39;ve run out of things to say, and run out of momentum. It all feels kind of pointless in a way, and it&#39;s hard to tell if any progress is being made. I don&#39;t want to give up on it, and every little bit counts, but damn... at some point there has to be some mainstream reaction to something, right? We can&#39;t just slide downward forever, right? I just don&#39;t even know any more. I don&#39;t mean to sound depressing, but fuck this world is so screwed up it&#39;s almost unbelievable. Like I literally can&#39;t believe it. Like I feel in a state of perpetual disbelief at the way people act and think. I write to channel my feelings, but it&#39;s so hard to talk to people in real life about this stuff... I imagine there are millions of people in the same boat. I keep saying that something will change when remaining the same takes more effort than changing. But I wonder if they&#39;ll ever allow that day to come. </p>

<p>I really wonder what life was like in the 1950s-80s, if it was really that much easier or if it just seems that way. </p>

<p>Everything seems like some bad dream... </p>

<p>Sorry to vent. It&#39;s just so frustrating to see the world like it is. Perhaps I just need to let it go. But that&#39;s almost like giving up. I really honestly don&#39;t know what to do anymore, but I know what needs to be done is to build something that makes the existing system obsolete  so we can evolve to something new. But I don&#39;t know how to actually manifest that. Yet. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was alive in the 70&#39;s and 80&#39;s and it was better in some ways. We did have a common enemy that we could unite against and there is little doubt in my mind that the better side won. That said, there were cracks in the foundation that I could see, even as a young boy. I saw the plants closing and my Dad worked for a tannery that he relocated with from Sheboygan, WI to Jackson, TN. Once all the shoe business went overseas, everyone lost their jobs and my Dad would have lost his if he hadn&#39;t proactive enough to get off the sinking ship and finish the last 30 years of his career working for a power utility in Madison, WI. The people left behind never really have recovered and I don&#39;t see how they will if the jobs are going to be low skill and they expect high wages. </p>

<p>All your feeling are shared by me. You are not alone on that. I have tried to live the American dream as a business owner and I still have two small businesses, but my day job is as a mid-level bureaucrat for a state agency in one of their field offices where my wage is near the top of the average household income. Without my government job, would be struggling. </p>

<p>The part that I have come to terms with is that we are just not going to be able to slow this train down until things start to become scarce and large numbers of people start starving to death, being wiped out by rising seas or extreme temps. I have been to third world countries and there is very little desire to curb their progression towards having all of the things that the western culture has provided. </p>

<p>My advice to you would be to keep caring, but also focus on trying to make your individual life as awesome as it can be. Go camping in places that have tremendous beauty, grow a garden, feed the birds, get involved in your local government and press them to do cool things like making space for farmers markets and public gathering, cook good food and invite people to share it with you, work on old machines and make them work again, etc. </p>

<p>Not everyone will want to get into these discussions with you, but I will and maybe there are some ideas that we could try that might work out. Start small and make the world you see everyday as good as it can be.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You cherry picked one example, then pretend you speak for them. It&#39;s obvious this &#39; violent hatemongering hivemind&#39; is allowed there, so they condone it. You can&#39;t just pretend you know what the opinion is of them, in fact later in that thread people advocating against being violent got downvoted. If this isn&#39;t allowed there, and not their view, why aren&#39;t calls to violence banned? You can&#39;t just cherrypick one example when it&#39;s obvious they are posting and for this. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s the same question I&#39;ve been asking myself. I made a subreddit that has 1400 subscribers at <a href="/r/magnora7">/r/magnora7</a>. But now I feel like I&#39;ve run out of things to say, and run out of momentum. It all feels kind of pointless in a way, and it&#39;s hard to tell if any progress is being made. I don&#39;t want to give up on it, and every little bit counts, but damn... at some point there has to be some mainstream reaction to something, right? We can&#39;t just slide downward forever, right? I just don&#39;t even know any more. I don&#39;t mean to sound depressing, but fuck this world is so screwed up it&#39;s almost unbelievable. Like I literally can&#39;t believe it. Like I feel in a state of perpetual disbelief at the way people act and think. I write to channel my feelings, but it&#39;s so hard to talk to people in real life about this stuff... I imagine there are millions of people in the same boat. I keep saying that something will change when remaining the same takes more effort than changing. But I wonder if they&#39;ll ever allow that day to come. </p>

<p>I really wonder what life was like in the 1950s-80s, if it was really that much easier or if it just seems that way. </p>

<p>Everything seems like some bad dream... </p>

<p>Sorry to vent. It&#39;s just so frustrating to see the world like it is. Perhaps I just need to let it go. But that&#39;s almost like giving up. I really honestly don&#39;t know what to do anymore, but I know what needs to be done is to build something that makes the existing system obsolete  so we can evolve to something new. But I don&#39;t know how to actually manifest that. Yet. </p>

<p>It makes me sad how much you know, yet you walk right in to the obvious traps they&#39;re laying for you. </p>

<p>The trap is the promotion of nonviolence. </p>

<p>The whole Gandhi nonviolent bullshit is just that. Bullshit. You should research how India actually achieved its independence. </p>

<p>Dude, I used to believe the same things you do now. Less than 10 years ago. But when you start digging a little deeper you understand how deep the rabbit hole goes in regards to the norms, values, and beliefs that society holds as sacred, and the things we are told that just aren&#39;t so.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Talking to you is like talking to a brick wall.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You keep pointing the finger at me but it&#39;s actually you, comrade. The belief in nonviolence is so engrained that you can&#39;t even hear what I&#39;m saying to you. </p>

<p>For some reason you think I want to be in violent confrontation. I don&#39;t. </p>

<p>I simply understand when it is neccessary and when it isn&#39;t. </p>

<p>You are of the belief that violence is never the answer. </p>

<p>Yet violent oppression is what we are faced with every single day in this society. </p>

<p>Just because it tends to be implicit rather than explicit doesn&#39;t make it any less true, or any less relevant to oppose. It is ubiquitous. </p>

<p>Keep digging comrade. You&#39;ll get there. </p>
