        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>These links below are here to illustrate a problem that was readily identified by the general public not so long ago that lead to some fairly widespread acceptance on the left which eventually lead to the Occupy movement. I hope, with a series of posts and links, to give shared context to show how various interests are convincing people to weaken their ability to resist an ever increasing progress toward fascism. I find that much of the sentiment from the right about the deteriorating rust belt is just a long awaited agreement with the Occupy movement - but now the left does not want to accept that they themselves were correct in their perceptions and observations that finally boiled over in 2011. The billionaires that were the target of the Mob in 2011 havent forgotten and have actively been trying to ensure that any ability to resist the steps toward an oligarchic kleptocracy is stamped out with as much zealous fervor as is necessary to ensure fascism succeeds in the US.</p>

<p>So First is &quot;The Problem&quot; (hint: inequality) </p>

<p>The Only Thing, Historically, That&#39;s Curbed Inequality: Catastrophe - The Atlantic</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Greatness remains in the eye of the beholder: making America more equal again will prove the more daunting challenge. Whereas incremental policy measures to shore up the fortunes of the middle class are both desirable and feasible, the past suggests there is no plausible way to vote, regulate, or teach society back to the levels of equality enjoyed by the postwar generation. History cannot predict the future, but its message is as unpalatable as it is clear: With the rarest of exceptions, great reductions in inequality were only ever brought forth in sorrow.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Trust in global institutions is at an all-time low, and there are few companies more global, or more powerful, than the tech titans driving America’s increasingly unequal 21st century economy. Some of the nation’s leading futurists are leading an effort to advance a universal basic income, or other forms of redistribution, to defuse that ticking time bomb. But such problems, which now preoccupy the nation’s new class of billionaires, are inherently political—and divisive—in nature</p>

<p>How has the wealth gap affected the American people?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This gap between the rich and poor, the haves and the have-nots, is what produced the backlash that brought Donald Trump to power. Our country isn’t just divided by politics or class, it’s divided by where you live. The advantaged urban parts of the country by the coast—New York, Boston, the San Francisco Bay Area, and Los Angeles—they’re the blue areas, but the rest of America is increasingly red. The wealth gap that’s occurring in places is behind the political backlash we’re seeing in our country.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>American upper-middle-class culture (where the opportunities are) is now laced with cultural signifiers that are completely illegible unless you happen to have grown up in this class. They play on the normal human fear of humiliation and exclusion. Their chief message is, “You are not welcome here.”</p>

<p>There has never been a greater inequality in wealth than right now. This is the soil where the seeds of revolution have always been planted. Are those in power and authority working to lessen the inequality for the sake of the people or for their own sake? Does it matter? Discuss.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s still miscast though. </p>

<p>The 1% is being re-defined as people who make $200,000 a year or a family that consists of a teacher and a nurse who combine to make that. This is of course the standard middle class family, but the previous administration and especially Bernie Sanders managed to cement the idea in the minds of gullible Americans that somehow the middle class is the 1% and they must be destroyed. The blame doesn&#39;t go solely on them of course. </p>

<p>This is the culmination of generations of work from politicians and sociologists working for the wealthiest of players. Once the public believes the middle class is the 1%, they are fucked. This enables the elite to push through the carbon tax in the coming decade, which will be the final transfer of wealth to the wealthiest 1/10 of 1%. </p>

<p>Once that occurs, they are going to kill off the vast majority of us, with a war or a super virus. At this point I think we are only about 10-15 years away from the great culling. And no, fucking Trump hasn&#39;t stopped or slowed up this agenda. No president since Kennedy has resisted this. </p>

<p>Sanders did no such thing. He often railed on the 1% and the top 1/10th of the 1% and how they don&#39;t pay their fair share. He talked about how Wall Street was making shit tons of money through speculation without being taxed. Please get your facts straight.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve come to believe that the dangerous separation of the American upper-middle class from the rest of society is a huge problem for politics because there&#39;s a sense of a bubble, there&#39;s a sense of people who are kind of making out pretty well from current trends and who are increasingly separate – occupationally, residentially, educationally and economically — from the rest of society. They are also disproportionately powerful and the fact that they are not only separate but unaware of the degree to which the system works in their favor strikes me as one of the most dangerous political facts of our time.</p>

<p>A family that consists of a teacher and a nurse 100% doesn&#39;t make that lol. </p>

<p>Median salary for nurses: 66k</p>

<p>Median salary for teachers: 36k (avg is 56k for nonstarting)</p>

<p>At best that comes to 102-122k. Which means that particular family would not be affected by progressive taxing. </p>

<p>Even acknowledging that, the class war isn&#39;t against people making 200k and is definitely not against FAMILIES making 200k. But people who make that much are being led to believe it is in an attempt to divert the discussion. </p>

<p>Bernie sanders fights for the poor and middle class. People making 200k would not being paying more in taxes. </p>

<p>Bernie sander&#39;s tax plan is as follows: </p>

<p>$0-18,40: 10% (same as current)</p>

<p>$18,45-$74,900: 15% (same as current)</p>

<p>$74,901-$151,200: 25% (same as current)</p>

<p>The upper middle class, lower wealthy class (250-464 does pay some higher taxes (2-4% more), the real changes are on the ultra wealthy (paying 3.4-12.4% more). Personally I&#39;d argue you could make some changes so the lower wages of those tax increases don&#39;t pay more and eliminate the tax break for the 464-500k. But even with that glitch, the ultra wealthy are the ones that would the ones taxed significantly more and it would provide the means necessary for universal healthcare and similar changes which would lower costs for the poor to upper middle class. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>See the article linked below. </p>

<p>You are forgetting something very simple after going to all that trouble to resurrect the tax plan of a controlled opposition global elite puppy dog shill candidate. </p>

<p>When the agenda is to create class warfare or when the agenda is to promote climate change or scare you about terrorists or anything else...facts don&#39;t matter, the only thing that matters is the continued promotion and advancement of a radical agenda. You must always be wary and careful of that. This agenda is now a religion, not a science...alas, even science is now a religion. </p>

<p>I&#39;m afraid we are approaching the age of ideology and reality tunnels and yeh age of common sense and facts is long gone. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A few points to start off 1. a post this well formed in the mom&#39;s basement of reddit is suspicious 2. the closing question of &#39;does it matter&#39; is a whole other issue- to discuss your points, one has to at least pretend so 3. the focus on the U.S. I think is too narrow. As cliche as it sounds (and as much as I don&#39;t like Thomas Friedman or whatever) the world has become flat. Global fascism with a global population of controlled commoners I think is the aim. The U.S. and its middle class and sense of entitlement and natural rights may be one of biggest obstacles, but the rest of the &#39;west&#39; isn&#39;t much different. That said, Asia is developing its own middle class so however that develops may inform the global class structure. </p>

<p>As far as required catastrophes, all around the world it seems like people are expecting this. A stock market crash, government insolvency, nuclear war, aliens, super-intelligent AI, whatever it takes, it seems like imminent monumental change is a given. Meanwhile, assets keep rising, low income jobs are created and inflation is low. It does seem ripe for a reemergence of the winking cossack. I suspect this time will be different however- particularly given your other points of the stripping of rights and resistance powers. Finally, some crazy psychology tools seem to have been deployed and machine learning in military has not even been demonstrated.  In the past, nature has been a check and balance- it seems humanity is moving beyond those constraints, but in 100 years this mere contemplation of self governance will appear perhaps melodramatic. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Indeed the problem is almost entirely Jewish. Inequality is created by Jewish bankers creating money out of thin air using their funny money to buy up all the property in country. We have more houses than people in this country but Jewish bankers have causes asset price inflation so people can&#39;t afford to live in their own homes anymore. It is not just home. Asset price inflation affects the cost of everything from the cost of going to college to medical care. We are being bled dry and even the so called woke conspiracy community is blind to it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So remain ignorant instead of embracing the people that would help your fight. Or you could read the post and find a way to <em>resist</em> because those in power only care about more power and money. So long as you are fighting the poor white guy that simply wants to feed his family you arent fighting the actual people perpetuating systemic racism. I get your feel. I do. The system is set up to disparage minorities - I agree with that and you would see how that is addressed in the articles that have been linked. The great news is that white people are feeling it too because what was once holding down the brown is holding down the rust belt too. And now you can have a coalition to fight against it and with vast numbers and greater influence and a system of laws that now support the minorities in greater ways then they were in the 1960&#39;s. And this coalition terrifies the ever living day-lights out of the .01%.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I applaud your efforts to dig beneath the veil of racial tensions and focus on the greater superstructure. TPTB have been racial determinists for a long time, framing as many problems as they can as you vs. your brother and sister who happen to not be the same skin color as you. Pretty typical technique of forcing us to look with paranoia and anger at each other or down upon those with lower socioeconomic status and blame them for everything-- probably not a coincidence that this Jim Crow-era rhetoric was resuscitated via the Southern Strategy, the War on Drugs and in some ways the War on Terror. I find it a persistent problem we must endure and see through in order to find actual peace, equality, and prosperity among all men. </p>

<p>At the same time, viewing societal ills as a class-based problem is something Neo-Nazis don&#39;t really want us to do, their program only works if we ignore this reality and focus solely on racial conflict as the real problem worth addressing. This is bullshit that only serves to divide and keep us focused on team sports, ignoring our real enemies and keepers who they themselves orchestrate the whole thing.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem is that while the right may be paying lip service to the damages accrued by the free trade agreements, placed squarely on the backs of the lower and middle classes, they haven&#39;t changed their policy.  They still think deregulation and lower taxes on the rich are the solutions.  And people on the right will point to the fact that most economists think that things like NAFTA will be good for the economy as a whole in the long run, they ignore that those same economists acknowledge the cost to get it going will be mostly shouldered by displaced workers while the rich continue to reap the rewards without much in the way of costs.  </p>

<p>Those on the left are still the only ones pushing for higher taxes on those with income in the upper brackets which will be needed if we are going to pay for things like negative income taxes (universal basic income/guaranteed minimum income), mass retraining programs, free basic college, etc.  Instead the right are still pushing for the exact opposite in spite of their lip service to win votes in places like the rust belt. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Then you are just being ignorant and turning a blind eye to how asset price inflation caused by Jewish bankers creating money out of thin air. When the bankers create money of thin air it causes the price of everything to rise except wages. We have more houses in this country then there are people yet the working class can&#39;t afford to live in their own homes because bankers have priced them out of the market.  It is not just housing. Asset price inflation affects the cost of everything from the cost of going to college to medical care. We are being bled dry and even the so called woke conspiracy community pretends it doesn&#39;t exist.</p>
