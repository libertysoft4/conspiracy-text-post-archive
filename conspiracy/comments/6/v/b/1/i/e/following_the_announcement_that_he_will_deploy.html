    <div class="md"><p>Obama told us the same thing and he had 8 years to do something yet he did nothing. 8 fucking years! Just left small numbers of troops over there to die. He wanted the illusion that he gave a crap because he is Muslim brotherhood plant. It&#39;s painfully obvious now as it was during the last 8 years to anybody that opened their eyes. This ain&#39;t my first rodeo. I&#39;ve been involved with the theory about conspiracy since my freshmen year of college when the towers were knocked down an hour away from me. The real deep state was in power since Bush Sr and the only thing obvious now is that Trump is fighting them at every turn. They were all complicit in this perpetual war.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that he is not capable of wrong doing. I guess I can explain it like this. My entire adult life has consisted of distrust for our government and in that time I have witnessed a 17 year war that was obviously shrouded in corruption, a revamp of the health insurance system at the expense of the middle class, the destruction of our border laws and with it the identity of Americans, a year over year trillion dollar increase in national debt at the expense of our future generations, as well as an education system that teaches to the lowest common denominator now...its been a frustrating 2 decades.....now we have somebody come in and call out all of those things with the promise that our future will fix those wrongs. In his first months he has made moves to believe that all of those things are actually possible now. I&#39;m choosing &quot;faith&quot; this time until he shows signs of any of his predecessors. And to this point I haven&#39;t been forced to lose it yet. You can stick with &quot;were all fucked and nobody can be trusted again&quot; routine. To each their own. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Every president comes in calling out everything that&#39;s wrong with the country. That&#39;s how they get elected. People believe they can fix it. At least for a little while.</p>

<p>Obamacare didn&#39;t fuck over the middle class. It insured millions of people in the middle class. I&#39;m one of them. It doesn&#39;t work great everywhere right now. But what&#39;s the Republican plan? Give <em>more</em> power back to the big insurance companies again? So they can give us life time caps and drop us for pre-existing conditions? Cool. </p>

<p>The identity of America is immigration. It always have been. Back in the day, people like you said the same thing about Irish people. It was huge when a katholic got elected as president. Older immigrants will always bitch about the new ones. It&#39;s happened for hundreds of years. </p>

<p>As for the debt. Trump plans to build a huge multi billion dollar wall, pump money into our military, pump money into infrastructure and cut taxes for everyone (including the mega rich). So good luck reducing the debt with all that. If he gets all that done, it will blow a nuclear hole in the deficit. </p>

<p>How many troops do you exactly expect Trump to send over that would make Obama&#39;s numbers look small? Obama had a peak of 100,000 troops stationed in Afghanistan and it took until 2015 before we even went below 25,000.</p>

<p>All Vietnam needed was for the US to pull out.  Tribal leaders are the government for large portions of Afghanistan whether or not the US pulls out.  This is just apologetics for the MIC. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>We will perpetually fight this war for 17 more years if w don&#39;t make a final push.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is no &#39;final&#39; push.   You can intensify bombing campaigns, but more civilians will be killed resulting in more people to view the US forces as enemies.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Of course we want out</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The MIC and its propaganda apparatus do not want out.  Afganistan is a pathway for pipelines, has oil and large cache of minerals.  But here is the most important part why the MIC does not want to pull out.  The prize has always been Iran.  The neocons are planning on a military confrontation in 5 years.  Iraq and Afganistan will allow the US forces to attack Iran from both sides.   That is how delusioned these people are.  They are not experts at foreign policy.  They are experts at war.  The US is like that bad dog owner, where the guard dog is running the house.  It dog does not respond to commands like: sit, stay and go back. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>without cleaning up the mess of the past 2 administrations. </p>

<p>Even the rhetoric is just a formula to justify never-ending wars. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It a cryptic speech. I think it was a good one for the people but read the translation below and you can decide for yourself:</p>

<p>This is speculation but this is what may be the message in Trump&#39;s speech.</p>

<p>America has been funneling heroine from Afghanistan and selling it all over the world including in America. Pakistan has helped this process and acted as a middle man just like Mexico acts like a middle man to import Colombian cocaine into America.</p>

<p>Obama and Bush were essentially allies with Pakistan who is a known supporter of terrorism. India is Pakistan&#39;s enemy. India is also Iran&#39;s ally. Iran is enemies with Israel and Saudi Arabia. Israel and Saudi Arabia are serious apartheid states who participate in terrorism and human rights violations worldwide including in their own land. The deep state regimes of Bush and Obama were friends with Israel and Saudi Arabia. The US, Saudis, amd Israelis ran the 9-11 false flag together to justify endless wars in the Middle East.</p>

<p>Basically, Trump is moving the alliances of America from Pakistan (eta al) to India (eta al) as long as India is willing to help pay the bill on fixing Afghanistan.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what he has planned for Afghanistan but he is hinting at hitting the problem with full force instead of half-assed. (Note: The deep state took a half ass approach in places like Vietnam and Afghanistan in order to maximize profits from the Military Industrial Complex since the longer we stay in war, the more money they make. The 2 main problems in Afghanistan are the Heroine trade and instability. Bush and Obama wanted the instability and they heroine trade to last as long as possible to maximize profits. Trump wants to eliminate it quickly.</p>

<p>The US has the most powerful and expansive military on the face of the Earth by far. This military has been used as cannon fodder for the worldwide cabal without any care if it bankrupts the US. Basically, the cabal gets what they want and the American taxpayer pays for it. If Trump is for the people, this should no longer be the case.</p>

<p>I&#39;m pretty sure Trump is aligning America with not only India but also Russia, Iran, and some other countries against Israel, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, and some other countries. Europe seems split. German government looks comprised. The U.K. looks compromised too but Brexit was a good turning point.</p>

<p>Basically, it looks like alliances are shifting fast. That speech was probably meant to be a warning to certain countries and an invitation to others.</p>

<p>Also, Trump mentioned the invasion and democratization of countries is over. Every country Obama and Bush tried to help has been destroyed because liberation was never the intention. It was only a cover story to fool the Americans. Quote:</p>

<p>&quot;But we will no longer use American military might to construct democracies in faraway lands or try to rebuild other countries in our own image. Those days are now over. Instead, we will work with allies and partners to protect our shared interests.&quot;</p>

Leaving there would create a vacuum into which ISIS could take over, just like they did when we left Iraq. This is also evidenced by the surge he was talking about. He didn&#39;t give any details like Obama did. This is smart for us tactically because it keeps the enemy guessing.</p>

<p>The fact that Trump didnt go with Bannon&#39;s plan does not change the fact that PMCs are very heavily used in Afghanistan and other warzones.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We didn&#39;t start out with the intent of staying in Europe, Japan or South Korea for that many years, but we did. The same will happen to Afghanistan. We can only hope they turn into a democracy and an ally, but that is unlikely. If we haven&#39;t won in Afghanistan in 17 years, what is going to be different about the next 4 or 5 years?  Nothing, that&#39;s what. More money wasted and more lives lost for nothing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First of all, I&#39;d like some sources on our intent regarding staying in said countries(not disagreeing, just curious as to what you&#39;re basing this on). Secondly, regardless of initial intent, we have stayed in those countries voluntarily because it benefits us. Thirdly, if you want to draw parallels between these cases and Afghanistan, our continued presence in said countries has been because we have either turned them into allies or because we were already allies. I personally can think of no downsides to a political climate in Afghanistan that makes a U.S.-Afghanistani alliance amenable to both parties. Fourthly, <em>many things</em> could change in the next four or five years. Please provide a source proving otherwise if you disagree. </p>

<p>Of course I did, this is basically Obama&#39;s speech from 2009 where he announced the troop surge. </p>
