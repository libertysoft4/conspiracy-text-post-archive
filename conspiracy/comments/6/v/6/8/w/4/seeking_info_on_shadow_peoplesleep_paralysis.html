        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Search function on the subreddit giving me mostly &quot;trump/shadow government&quot; stuff.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve regularly suffered from sleep paralysis since I was about 4-5 years old. Most of the time it&#39;s Greys, sometimes just general shadow entities. They&#39;re always terrifying, but the other night I saw the man in the hat for the first time.</p>

<p>I have never been so afraid in my life, and I&#39;m now only able to fall asleep when I&#39;m either drunk enough to pass out all night or I stay awake until my body won&#39;t let me anymore. I am desperate for anything I can get on this, specifically the hat man.</p>

<p>As crazy as it sounds, I&#39;ve always been able to tell myself it was just crossed wires in my brain but this felt different. It has utterly consumed me the past few days and I just want to be able to not be afraid to fall asleep again. I did a google image search just to show my wife a general idea of what he looked like and I had a panic attack as soon as I saw the drawings, and I&#39;m at the end of my rope.</p>

<p>I would really appreciate literally ANYTHING that could shed some light on this, and prevention measures beyond not falling asleep on my back (which seems to be the easiest way to make it happen).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve suffered that many a time, I can relate to how shitty it is. Seems to be somewhat connected to underlying stress in my life and other things I think. Hasn&#39;t happened lately (knock on wood). I&#39;ve never &quot;seen&quot; anything like a lot of people describe such as shadow people or aliens/supernatural. But there is an overwhelming sense of dread that always accompanies it. I&#39;ve had it happen falling asleep and waking, repeatedly when falling asleep is the worst IMO as it would happen 4-7 times before I could actually fall asleep, feels like hours. Definitely a scary thing to experience. I&#39;d like to know more about it. Asked my dr and she said if I wasn&#39;t getting enough sleep/regular pattern it could cause it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not to turn this against religion, but for those who aren&#39;t religious (or those who are other religions), I&#39;ve found that controlling the fear is what does this. Once you can get past that primal fear, or at least understand it, the environment becomes extremely easy to manipulate. Jesus absolutely can do this, I&#39;m not trying to deny that, but even those without faith can convert from sleep paralysis to lucid dreaming if you can find a way to control the fear. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Same thing my dad said actually. I would tend to agree with the comment further down as I take a more gnostic approach to Jesus but at this point I&#39;m willing to try anything when it happens again. Granted that&#39;s assuming I&#39;m able to keep my wits about me. I&#39;ve been dealing with this for 10 years and every time I go to sleep I think I can try a new trick but then it happens and I can&#39;t think about anything except trying to move a finger or scream (which is just gurgling irl) or something to wake up. My wife is amazing, she&#39;s great at hearing me in her sleep and immediately shaking me til I snap out of it, and if she wakes up at night she&#39;ll roll me on my side. I&#39;m lucky to have her because it&#39;s only gotten worse as I&#39;ve gotten older.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I smoke somewhat frequently, and yea you&#39;re right, no dreams when I do. I don&#39;t like to smoke all the time though because it makes my reaction times slow and I can&#39;t afford that setback when I&#39;m working.</p>

<p>As far as OBE&#39;s, not unless I&#39;m tripping. Which hasn&#39;t happened in a few years. That&#39;s actually something that helps. One trip and I&#39;m good for a few months. It&#39;s been about 2 years since my last one and it&#39;s worse than ever. Believe me I wish I could get acid from a doctor because it&#39;s the best medicine In The world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess DMT would be even better. You can easily buy it (or LSD) on the darknet (see r/DarknetMarkets).</p>

<p>However you can spontaneously induce lucid dreams and OBEs, without drugs; I&#39;m sure you realize sleep paralysis comes from your psychosoma not having yet fully re-entered your physical body, as it leaves the body during sleep (usually hovers just above it). That means you regain lucidity before being fully back into intraphysical awareness; thus you can see &quot;shadows&quot;, i.e. perceive extra-material reality. There is nothing to be afraid of when it happens.</p>

<p>If you look into the fields of study that are adjacent to lucid dreaming and OBEs, I believe you will find great solace. Lots of people would envy your natural ability to become conscious while out of the body (however involuntarily).</p>

<p>Think of it this way: simple dreams would be scary to someone who doesn&#39;t know dreams exist, doesn&#39;t know anyone else who dreams, and never read anything about dreams. But ultimately it is just another state of consciousness, which becomes normal once we know about it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can really relate to this, as I suffer from something similar, as well.  For some reason, my dreams can turn into astral projections of some sorts, and other things like double false awakenings (terrifying if you&#39;ve never had one). I also suffer from night terrors and have since I was a kid. </p>

<p>Here are my thoughts. When we sleep we sort of cross into other dimensions, with other dimensional energies/beings. Some are positive and some are negative, but, just because they may appear to be &quot;dark shadows&quot;, does not necessarily mean they are negative. It doesn&#39;t really work like that in the astral realms, imo.</p>

<p>Your state of mind and vibrations somewhat control how they manifest. There <em>are negative energies,</em> though, who feed off your negative energy (fear, anxiety, torment, etc etc) is all a source of power/energy for them. Alcohol, usually increases anxiety, especially if you are somewhat withdrawing, which if you drink a lot, you will be in a somewhat constant state, and this carries over when you are sleeping/dreaming. Alcohol, also opens a gateway for negative energies usually, imo, which is why they&#39;re called &quot;spirits&quot;. Bad mindset mixed with alcohol and you are opening a gateway, that you&#39;re not going to like, if you do not know how to deal with it. </p>

<p>My advice. Find something more natural to help you sleep, like maybe 5HTP or Cannabis, to name two, but there are others. When you see these shadow figures, remain calm and ask for the guidance of your spirit being through your spirit guide. Acknowledge the entity, and say I am not afraid of you, and I am of higher vibration than you are. I have done this before, and it has worked for me, but everyone is different.</p>

<p>Anyways, this is getting longer than I expected. I wish you the best of luck, friend!</p>

<p>I can agree with this.  I think when we sleep, we are unburdened by things like sight or sound and our souls are sensing things we normally cannot see.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The night I saw the hat man was about 3 days into trying melatonin for sleep. And it was actually the first time I&#39;ve ever had the &quot;false awakening&quot; you&#39;re talking about.  Typically I just wake up in the room I&#39;m in unable to move and then they come. This time I figured it was like that, but it wasn&#39;t until I woke up the first time that I saw him. Then i woke up again for real. I&#39;ve never had a &quot;dream within a dream&quot; before which is one of the reasons this time felt so different. That and the fact that when I see the regular ones it&#39;s normal sleep paralysis and I can eventually snap out of it but when he was there.. I can&#39;t even describe it. I&#39;ve been terrified of greys my whole life, but him.. it was like the first time you see Pyramid Head in Silent Hill, or something out of Lovecraft. Like this thing is so far beyond you that all your prayers and all your plans just disintegrate in front of you.</p>

<p>I realize how melodramatic I sound but I literally cannot understate how utterly powerless I felt. With the others I can at least manage to wiggle a finger or scream before they touch me. But he got closer than any of them ever has. I didn&#39;t sleep at all for a day or two after.</p>

<p>Secondly, you&#39;ve got to not be afraid. Tell then firmly to leave. They generally seek fear so think positively even during the day. </p>

<p>Lastly, you might doubt this but if you believe this is real then why not right? You can actually summon angels. Look up their calling spells, there usually in the form of a song. Memorise it and call upon them if all else fails. </p>

<p>This seems really true in my experience. Once you let the fear in, the shadow and paralysis get stronger and stronger. I was told they can&#39;t hurt you but I have been choked, I have been smothered and pushed deep into my mattress to the point I couldn&#39;t breathe. I have had the blanket thrashed around right infront of me! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>OP just move. Move away to a new house or apartment. It will stop at least temporarily. When I move mine goes away for atleast 4 years but it always catches back up to me. </p>

<p>I noticed my nightmares and sleep paralysis slowly increased in intensity the longer I lived in one location. The worst I experienced was about 5 years ago. I went to bed laying on my back. Suddenly I couldn&#39;t move. The shadow figure appeared out of the corner of my eye to my right. I couldn&#39;t move to look at it but it was moving towards me. Once it reached the side of my bed all I could see was black smoke. Almost like the smoke monster in LOST. I was under my blanket and I felt safe. I remember thinking I&#39;m safe under my blanket. and then I could finally make out the figure of a grim reaper or it looked like one of the dementors from harry potter. It began thrashing my blanket around wildly. and then it started to scream louder and louder. One long scream like those steam whistles. Ear defeaning screaming that made me feel like I was already dead. I don&#39;t remember what happened but it was gone. The blanket stopped thrashing around. I could move again but I didn&#39;t want to. I was afraid to leave my bed. My body was dripping in sweat. </p>

<p>In that same apartment I had all kinds of paranormal things happen. My GF at the time witnessed glowing balls of light floating around my bedroom one night while I was asleep. She woke me up suddenly because she was scared but I never got to see what she saw. </p>

<p>I moved and have been sleep paralysis free for 5 years now. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know exactly how you feel. I remember a shadow man in a hat with his creepy smile and red eyes staring right at me. He kept following my gaze. It&#39;s terrifying. Only way I coped with it is having something on whilst I sleep (e.g a tv show or something). It also helps to have a decent sleeping habit. Most of the times when these things would occur is when I was really tired but desperately trying to stay awake. This would often lead to sleep paralysis. So try sorting that out. I was terrified for the longest time, this type of stuff has happened since I was young. It stopped when I hit about 15/16 though, not completely but it did not occur frequently (maybe once every 6 or so months) and now I haven&#39;t had it in a few years thank goodness.</p>

<p>Try not to be afraid however, easier said than done I know. My heart used to beat out of my chest but after so long whenever it happened I was like &quot;not this shit again&quot;. It became so common. I&#39;ve not followed any of the occult/religion stuff with this. </p>

<p>It stopped for me when I started fighting back against whatever this is. The fear had caused me to snap and I was no longer afraid, just angry. </p>

<p>All anecdotal, so I guess to summarise:</p>

<p>-Have a decent sleeping habit</p>

<p>-If that doesn&#39;t help, have something on at night (i.e, I have my laptop at the side of my bed and watch stuff until I fall asleep). Even though I don&#39;t have any weird stuff happening to me now I still do this out of habit.</p>

<p>You are stronger than you give yourself credit for. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Laptop stays on cartoons at night. It seems to cut off right before they show up.</p>

<p>Decent sleep habits though, that ones definitely harder. I&#39;m a line cook so sometimes I don&#39;t get home til 3 am and I regularly work 16 hour shifts. I just take what I can when I can.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Unfortunately being overtired was the most reliable way to trigger sleep paralysis/hallucinations both visual and auditory. If there&#39;s no way for you to help that then I&#39;m not sure mate. </p>

<p>One thing that helped is swapping the side I slept on. Not sure how that works. I would sleep on my right side and get constant paralysis/hallucinations but after I woke up and swapped to my other side I was fine. </p>

<p>Also, fear of sleeping makes it worse because you&#39;re desperately trying to stay up whilst being super tired. Best of luck to you, hope all goes well. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>OP, call to Jesus for help, even just with your mind if you can&#39;t speak, and even just with your intent if you can&#39;t put a coherent thought together. Jesus is God, Jesus has authority over all demons. If you try to use his name as some magic keyword, or if you try to just say his name as an experiment, you probably won&#39;t see results, but if you legit call out to HIM, the PERSON, your experience will stop and you will be safe.</p>

<p>Be aware, there are other ways that people will recommend to stop your sleep paralysis experiences. In many cases, indulging these techniques will actually give the demons more authority over you than they had before. However the demons may act as though these techniques work, in order to encourage you to continue in the techniques, because this is their intention, to increase the amount of authority they have in your life and to hurt you more. Be safe brah</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I had an encounter with a Shadow entity recently, it was the most terrifying thing I have ever seen. It screamed at me with a face I cannot forget, with tentacles, teeth, and red eyes. But I did not allow it to scare me, I chased it off and told it to &quot;fuck off and never come back&quot;. I&#39;ve always had an underlying fear of the dark, and after that day, I can be in complete darkness without any worries.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly I feel like if mine had tentacles theyd be less scary. It&#39;s not even what they do that&#39;s scary, usually they just look at me and I wake up before they touch me. It&#39;s that whole Lovecraft thing of it&#39;s not what they do it&#39;s just the fact that they exist. At least for hat man. Like they could wipe out an entire civilization just wiping their brow, like we don&#39;t even register as a thing to them, no more than the bacteria in the dirt we walk on have an effect on us. The fact that it looked &quot;at me&quot; was almost coincidental.
Granted the Greys feel a lot more personal but the feeling I got from the man in the hat was like he could blink his eyes and the entirety of human existence would come and go. I don&#39;t really know how else to explain it. Like I said earlier I know it sounds melodramatic but I&#39;ve never felt fear like that before.</p>

Creating a truely frightening experience that is the percieved in a half lucid like state ... A sort of mental ritual not unlike fighting a bogart in the harry potter series actually works surprising well if you are in a lucid enough state.

I seen it when I was 7/8. Tall, long black coat, wide brimmed black hat and yellow snake like eyes and sharp needle like teeth. Grinning at me. </p>

<p>I know a guy who&#39;s making a documentary about it and he&#39;s interviewing people via Skype about their experiences. &quot;Kyle Jay&quot; he&#39;s called and the Facebook group is &quot;The Hat Man Files: Documentary&quot;. </p>

<p>Once you&#39;re aware of it, you&#39;ll start noticing his image in popular culture everywhere! (music videos, posters, advertising etc) </p>

<p>People all over the world report seeing the entity, a lot of people see him during childhood, there&#39;s thousands of reports online. </p>

<p>And funnily enough, the reports of seeing him sky rocket just before times of crisis (terrorist attacks etc.) </p>

<p>This seems really true in my experience. Once you let the fear in, the shadow and paralysis get stronger and stronger.

    <div class="md"><p>The night I saw the hat man was about 3 days into trying melatonin for sleep. And it was actually the first time I&#39;ve ever had the &quot;false awakening&quot; you&#39;re talking about.  Typically I just wake up in the room I&#39;m in unable to move and then they come. This time I figured it was like that, but it wasn&#39;t until I woke up the first time that I saw him. Then i woke up again for real. I&#39;ve never had a &quot;dream within a dream&quot; before which is one of the reasons this time felt so different. That and the fact that when I see the regular ones it&#39;s normal sleep paralysis and I can eventually snap out of it but when he was there.. I can&#39;t even describe it. I&#39;ve been terrified of greys my whole life, but him.. it was like the first time you see Pyramid Head in Silent Hill, or something out of Lovecraft. Like this thing is so far beyond you that all your prayers and all your plans just disintegrate in front of you.</p>

<p>I realize how melodramatic I sound but I literally cannot understate how utterly powerless I felt. With the others I can at least manage to wiggle a finger or scream before they touch me. But he got closer than any of them ever has. I didn&#39;t sleep at all for a day or two after.</p>
