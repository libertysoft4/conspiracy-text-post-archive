In the book the President of the Galaxy&#39;s job is specifically to make as big of a spectacle as possible to hold the public&#39;s attention while the people with the real power run the government behind the scenes.

<p>Also, spoilers but in a later book they track down the man who&#39;s actually making the decisions and it turns out to be a dude living alone in a shack in the middle of nowhere. He has no idea what&#39;s going on in the Galaxy and has no outside influences on him, so once in a while a few government suits visit and ask him various questions about policy.</p>

<p>It&#39;s also poking a little fun at conspiracy theorists. The guy driving the plot of that book is basically one of us, and he&#39;s enacted an incredibly complicated, years-spanning plot to uncover the secret entity pulling the strings of the world, and when it finally leads him to this dude in a shack he feels... disappointed. He finally revealed &quot;The Truth&quot; and it&#39;s... kinda lame.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When it comes down to the man in the shack i feel that this represents every single one of us, we are each isolated in this lonely shack (read : human body) without the capacity at all to confirm if anything outside of this shack (body) is true. We make peace with the small things around us (the cat) but anything outside of what we know we decide isn&#39;t up to us and that we can&#39;t be expected to know of it. </p>

<p>So whenever the elite truly realise who make the decisions (the people (at least through some form of consent)) and try to find out what to do by asking them, they are rebuffed and disappointed because they realise that those who make the decisions (by existing in a certain way and leading a certain life) don&#39;t want to know about the decisions.</p>

<p>It has only been since listening to Alan Watts talk about bhuddism in the last few weeks that let me see this perspective even though i have loved the book for years since it was given to me. Hope this new perspective adds even more depth to a brilliant book.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No not projecting at all. You can either take a shallow approach to existance or a deeper approach. 
Just because i use more words and flesh out the complexity of a concept doesn&#39;t mean i&#39;ve bundled additional meaning and baggage to his writing out of nowhere. Language is merely a tool to convey meaning and what i wrote is the language i would use to convey the meaning i think that passage had. I really don&#39;t see Douglas Adams as a man who sticks to the mundane.</p>

<p>What about that story of that race which keeps voting in lizard people only because if they didn&#39;t vote, the wrong lizard would get in. What do you think Adams is talking about there? 
Or the mindset and character of the golgafrinchans who corrupted the life that mankind might have known by mixing their dna with earths original inhabitants. 
Or the bit of the book where he talks about two tribes on a planet that are permanently locked in conflict and that conflict causes great harm to a third tribe. Everytime that third tribe seeks the other out for a reason, they are given one that is so convincing that the listener is utterly drawn in, believing it. Yet when they get back to their tribe to explain it they cannot remember or understand what the reason really was... but that it made lots of sense at the time. (now i think about it that seems like a perfect analogy for those who get drawn into the false reason for war). 
I would also look into what Douglas Adams did in his spare time, his story of the baji dolphin brings tears to my eyes. This was a man who looked for more meaning in things, not less.
I don&#39;t think i demean him or his ideas to draw the associations and connections that i do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You were not being sarcastic? I very easily assumed you meant that i was lording some form of intelligence over you and that i was reducing myself for doing so.
If that is so then i apologise for my anger and rudeness. It is a fault that i still struggle to break in the way that i make assumptions regarding others intentions. 
You are right when you say they could be best summed up by &quot;hang the sense of it... I&#39;d much rather be happy than right any day&quot; but after rereading them so many times i could not help but come to the conclusion that Adams is constantly talking about real life on earth with every anecdotal experiance arthur has, every wierd tangent that is explored is Adams way of indirectly approaching something closer to home. </p>

<p>By starting the book with the destruction of Earth he gives himself the freedom to write about our society in any way he wants by using the disguise of being any other society in the galaxy because that way he&#39;s technically only writing fiction.</p>

<p>The end result still doesn&#39;t make sense but reading his words helps me move to a more balanced mindset to it all; it&#39;s like i&#39;m more okay with how mad the world is. 
One of the other ideas i liked was the danger sensitive sunglasses that zaphod had, almost like the opposite of the sunglasses in the movie They Live.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I really do try not to think myself or act with the presumption of intelligence, i do use language in a strange way but that&#39;s more related to the fact that i just don&#39;t interact with many people in my day to day life. My spontaneously long responses might clue you in on that and it&#39;s not a thing that i take pleasure in. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t really know those people though i can go look them up and tbh i&#39;m not sure in which ways i spoken that are incorrect and in which ways i should speak. It seems that maybe your suggestions might remedy that.
I try to write the words that mean what i say, the only meaning i hope others infer from my words are the definitions that are all agreed on and that they might discern any bias that i include.</p>

<p>I really am putting thought towards those ideas i mentioned about all being the same consciousness and thinking that way would make it pointless to try and make others feel that i am more intelligent.
Earlier i was needlessly angry but now i am just sad.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The only way to cure it is start speaking to other people. No use in writing anything if no one else can even relate to it. If you were on a deserted island, blinded, would you spend your time trying to recreate the last supper?</p>

<p>You know why Dylan and Lennon and Marley all used simple words? Because they are enough for someone that can use them right. </p>

<p>I guess it depends on your scope of truth. If you write to find out what is true to you, that is incredibly enriching. And you don&#39;t have to show anyone, you can burn everything you write immediately. Most people won&#39;t connect with that, though.</p>

<p>If you try to write to find out what is true for everyone, it changes into an impossible task. Like I said before. Middle path. Check out the actual texts of Buddhism and Hinduism, even just to read them as stories</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;ve hit the nail on the head. My writings are all for the sake of finding out what is true to me and that explains why my dialogue seems laid with cobblestone bumps. </p>

<p>Do you know what the facebook ai told me when i started trying to pry it with questions. Something about writing a book about being a chess grandmaster and i think it meant that if i worked to get to the point where i could write such a book then the actual book would be the most meaningless aspect of it all.
I&#39;m thinking of looking for a local bhuddist centre where i can go and talk to people; everything i find on my own is only ever going to be a result of the echo chamber perspective of the world that i have built up.
My capacity to miss worthwhile wisdom is likely huge so i think it might be good to ask for help.</p>

<p>What you said about simple words is also the reason i like Trump, i&#39;m still not sure about what his actions mean as politics and governing is always more complex than the media portrays. It seems like he uses simple words in his speeches because he knows that the act of communicating the information is more important than the complexity of the form of the information.</p>

<p>Simple doesn&#39;t mean stupid, reading discworld novels about Captain Carrot taught me that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Presidents are so effete.  The Junta rules.</p>

<p>You saw it tonight when Trump told the American People we&#39;re still going to continue the war in Afghanistan even after 16 years of fighting.  </p>

<p>Judging from Trump&#39;s campaign speches, he doesn&#39;t want to continue the war at all, but the Junta and CIA do.</p>

<p>The &quot;Defense&quot; companies want to make more money hand over fist.</p>

<p>Trump knows he&#39;s staring down the barrel of impeachment if he doesn&#39;t send those 4,000 additional troops to Afghanistan.  Or staring at the loss of his financial empire as Special Prosecutor Mueller continues sniffing around everywhere.  Or staring at something worse than impeachment and financial loss.  </p>

<p>The CIA and the Military Industrial companies don&#39;t play games.  They don&#39;t like challenges to their power and authority.  He may yet face impeachment if he doesn&#39;t continue to tow their line, and they&#39;ll continue to keep the heat up on him.</p>

<p>Trump&#39;s learning the elected President of the American People is subordinate to the U.S. Junta / CIA / &quot;Defense&quot; companies.</p>

There&#39;s plenty of Kafka-esque humor in the first book especially -- banality of bureaucracy and government on a galactic scale.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The people are the power. They are harnessed by those we think are powerful. Would they be absent us? Of course not. So what controls people the best? Money. Give me control of a nation&#39;s money and I care not who writes its laws. If they don&#39;t like what the president is doing, they can threaten to tank the economy covertly. The president always get blamed for that issue. The perpetrators will just profit from the engineered suffering as they did in the past, while the president and future presidents will be schooled to obey these useless eaters like good little servants. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No not projecting at all. You can either take a shallow approach to existance or a deeper approach. 
Just because i use more words and flesh out the complexity of a concept doesn&#39;t mean i&#39;ve bundled additional meaning and baggage to his writing out of nowhere. Language is merely a tool to convey meaning and what i wrote is the language i would use to convey the meaning i think that passage had. I really don&#39;t see Douglas Adams as a man who sticks to the mundane.</p>

<p>What about that story of that race which keeps voting in lizard people only because if they didn&#39;t vote, the wrong lizard would get in. What do you think Adams is talking about there? 
Or the mindset and character of the golgafrinchans who corrupted the life that mankind might have known by mixing their dna with earths original inhabitants. 
Or the bit of the book where he talks about two tribes on a planet that are permanently locked in conflict and that conflict causes great harm to a third tribe. Everytime that third tribe seeks the other out for a reason, they are given one that is so convincing that the listener is utterly drawn in, believing it. Yet when they get back to their tribe to explain it they cannot remember or understand what the reason really was... but that it made lots of sense at the time. (now i think about it that seems like a perfect analogy for those who get drawn into the false reason for war). 
I would also look into what Douglas Adams did in his spare time, his story of the baji dolphin brings tears to my eyes. This was a man who looked for more meaning in things, not less.
I don&#39;t think i demean him or his ideas to draw the associations and connections that i do.</p>
