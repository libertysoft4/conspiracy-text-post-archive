I would vote for Jessie Ventura in a heartbeat. His show conspiracy theory is part of that resume. Few politicians dare question the orthodoxy and I want to see a lot more of it. It&#39;s too bad Trump is too loose with the facts to do that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You might as well have voted for Jill in the last round if you wanted to send the middle finger to the elites.    Libertarianism is bs.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hayek&#39;s plan: peddled as Libertarian, supporting &quot;Liberty&quot;, but based on the inaccurate notion that &quot;government&quot; is evil and root of all corruption. A self serving lie. Government is the people, but the Monopolist&#39;s use &quot;government&quot; as a simple false target, a straw man, a distraction, a curtain to hide behind. In practice, government today, and for generations, is merely a puppet used as the force projector controlled by the money masters, pay to play, bought and sold to the highest bidders of the deep state.
Hayek&#39;s 4 Planks:
1) Deregulate global financial markets - DONE  2) Deregulate global trade - DONE  3) Bankrupt all sovereigns and nations with fiat (empty, unbacked, meaningless) paper &quot;debt&quot; (thereby neuter a nation&#39;s capability to enforce laws - eliminate the people&#39;s ability to defend against being consumed by these 1%) - DONE  4) Privatize Everything. create permanent rent payers of even the most basic necessities of life (Air, water, food, shelter). - Almost COMPLETE</p>
