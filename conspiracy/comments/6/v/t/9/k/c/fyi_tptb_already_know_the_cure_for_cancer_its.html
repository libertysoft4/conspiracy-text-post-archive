<p>That&#39;s why both of these Cures are BANNED in USA. Who do you think Banned them? Satanic Pharma.</p>

<p>This is the biggest scam in America. That&#39;s how your Doctors can afford Porsches, Mercedes, Bentleys and Rolls Royces. Ask yourself where the fuck did they get all that money? By scamming poor people, poor patients out of their life savings. </p>

<p>These Doctors are Pure Evil. Pure Refined Evil. They make Doctor Mengele look like an Angel.</p>

<p>This is The Scam of the Century.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t worry: Drain The Swamp (DTS) also applies not only to Politicians but also Doctors. In fact Doctors are more evil than Politicians. Politicians just swindle generic government funds, but Doctors make billions off of the misery of poor people, and sick patients; Doctors Milk their Misery, for Money.</p>

<p>Regardless, they will all be Purged in the flaming fires of Hell. (DTS)</p>

<p>Edit: Evil Pharma Shills have now been triggered and are coming out of the woodwork like rats and roaches to Downvote and Suppress the Truth about a NATURAL Cancer Cure like Hemp Oil, B17, and Cannabinoids..</p>

<p>Notice the massive Shill Pushback. That tells you Everything you need to know. They want to keep the Sheeple stupid so they can continue to rake in that sweet sweet Pharma Cash Money.</p>

<p>Studies indicate 0.5 to 3.5 milligrams (mg) cyanide per kilogram of body weight can be lethal. EFSA’s Scientific Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain set a safe level for a one-off exposure (known as the Acute Reference Dose, or “ARfD”) of 20 micrograms per kilogram of body weight. This is 25 times below the lowest reported lethal dose.</p>

<p>Based on these limits and the amounts of amygdalin typically present in raw apricot kernels, EFSA’s experts estimate that adults could consume three small apricot kernels (370mg), without exceeding the ARfD. For toddlers the amount would be 60mg which is about half of one small kernel.</p>

<p>OR you can educate yourself.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Chocolate contains a substance called theobromine, which is similar to caffeine. In large amounts, theobromine can be toxic for both dogs <strong>and humans</strong>; however toxicity is very rare in people even when very large quantities of chocolate are consumed. Dogs metabolise, or break down, theobromine much more slowly than humans. </p>

<p>But I&#39;m gonna guess you are going to reply with: &quot; but chocolate is different&quot; when it&#39;s actually not.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah the science on this seems to be complex and easy to confuse people over. I note that the EFSA website has an article warning about apricot seeds, but then goes on to talk about cyanide in isolate, disregarding the fact that the cyanide in the seed is part of a molecule that may or may not break down directly into the type of cyanide (anion) that kills you.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the key fact:</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amygdalin">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amygdalin</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>which can be released as the toxic cyanide anion by the action of a beta-glucosidase: when eaten by people amygdalin releases the cyanide which poisons them</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Note the use of &quot;can be released&quot; (not &quot;will be released&quot;) and also that it requires the action of beta-glucosidase.</p>

<p>I believe this next article goes on to explain how the action of beta-glucosidase happens, and why apricot seeds target cancer without poisoning you:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.chrisbeatcancer.com/b17-laetrile-alternative-cancer-treatment-suppressed-50-years/">https://www.chrisbeatcancer.com/b17-laetrile-alternative-cancer-treatment-suppressed-50-years/</a></p>

<p>Then you have things like this:</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amygdalin">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amygdalin</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The promotion of laetrile to treat cancer has been described in the medical literature as a canonical example of quackery, and as &quot;the slickest, most sophisticated, and certainly the most remunerative cancer quack promotion in medical history&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There&#39;s the quack attack. Whenever I see this I roll my eyes at whoever is talking, because they are not being scientific. So what about chemo? Chemo is poisonous, not guaranteed, and can kill people. It could be said chemo is the most sophisticated quack cancer treatment out there.</p>

<p>Another thing worth mentioning is, don&#39;t you think the government would do something to prevent or shut down websites instructing people to ingest poison and kill themselves because it might be a cure? Do you think they&#39;d allow these &quot;Charles Manson&quot; and &quot;Doctor Kevorkian&quot; types to be writing death sentences to desperate people online?</p>

<p>This leaves me with an unsavory conclusion. The only way to know if it kills cancer or kills you is to try it. And that&#39;s a scary thought. It&#39;s such a scary thought most people won&#39;t even attempt it. And this is where there might be a conspiracy.</p>

<p>There&#39;s literally an amendment to the constitution that prevents the government from doing that. They can prosecute for endangerment afterwards but not shut down websites. (This is what they do)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I did that. The first article is from EFSA, which has basically suffered tremendous science lobbying and regulatory capture. A report found that 60% of EFSA&#39;s &quot;experts&quot; were rife with conflict of interest, having direct or indirect ties to the food and feed industry.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/science-policymaking/news/food-safety-agency-faces-fresh-accusation-of-industry-ties/">https://www.euractiv.com/section/science-policymaking/news/food-safety-agency-faces-fresh-accusation-of-industry-ties/</a></p>

<p>EFSA even fought against the IARC in their assessment of Roundup being a 2A carcinogen.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nrdc.org/experts/jennifer-sass/glyphosate-iarc-got-it-right-efsa-got-it-monsanto">Glyphosate - IARC got it right, EFSA got it from Monsanto</a></p>

<p>So it would appear your Google search for &quot;Apricot Kernels Cyanide&quot; does in fact take you straight to Big Pharma propaganda.</p>

<p>Now, whether or not apricot seeds will cure cancer or kill you, I do not know. It appears there are many types of apricot seeds, which means there could be a lot of &quot;sugar pills&quot; or &quot;bad apples&quot; out there, it is said the more bitter ones are what you&#39;re after. A drug based on this was developed called latriole, which still seems to be in use today in some parts of the world. It is hard to find more than anecdotal evidence.</p>

<p>The way I understand it is how the cyanide is present in the seeds, it&#39;s not the same as taking straight cyanide. Your body carries an inhibitor that will make this cyanide &quot;non-poisonous&quot; to your normal cells, but cancer cells do not have this inhibitor so the cyanide works to attack the cancer cells.</p>

<p>All in all I&#39;d say this is an interesting topic definitely worth more research/study.</p>

<p>How? Cancer cells get their energy from glucose, right?</p>

<p>Well glucose is vital for our bodies to function. You literally die if it drops too low. Even if you eat absolutely nothing for several days, your body will break tissues down to maintain a minimum glucose level. Even if you avoid sugars and carbohydrates entirely, your body will maintain a minimum blood sugar level. </p>

<p>Cancer cells always have energy. If other cells in the body are getting nourishment, cancer cells are getting nourishment.</p>

<p>Anyone that thinks that the scientific community is in on a conspiracy is wrong beyond comprehension.

Having a cancer cure under your belt is  also guaranteed to make your career. Absolutely nobody is going to slave away for shit pay and then not publish a cancer cure because they get money, since they could get more money, fame, international recognition and same millions of lives by publishing it.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t claim to know enough to say that apricot pits + hemp oil will cure cancer, but you wouldn&#39;t have to get every single doctor to willingly participate in the hoax. If they learn in school that natural cures are bullshit, and only pharmaceuticals or chemo can help, they&#39;ll be pushing the agenda without actively knowing it.</p>

It&#39;s been erased from the post, but op originally made a claim that these natural cures would starve the cancer to death, which seems fishy to me since cancer doesn&#39;t eat... But, really I have no idea since I&#39;m not a doctor. All I initially said would that id be a bit scared to go against medical advice to test this out unless maybe I was terminal and had nothing else to lose. </p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/bWNpO5vvhpk">https://youtu.be/bWNpO5vvhpk</a></p>

<p>Also you can safely consume a few of those apricot kernels with no problem. Stop fear mongering.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Studies indicate 0.5 to 3.5 milligrams (mg) cyanide per kilogram of body weight can be lethal. EFSA’s Scientific Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain set a safe level for a one-off exposure (known as the Acute Reference Dose, or “ARfD”) of 20 micrograms per kilogram of body weight. This is 25 times below the lowest reported lethal dose.</p>

<p>Based on these limits and the amounts of amygdalin typically present in raw apricot kernels, EFSA’s experts estimate that adults could consume three small apricot kernels (370mg), without exceeding the ARfD. For toddlers the amount would be 60mg which is about half of one small kernel.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How am I fear mongering? I was simply pointing out something another commenter stated. I never made any claims to the amount of cyanide that is needed to ingest to kill a person. Also, the quoted text you provide states that a human can consume only three small stones and a toddler only one half. Not sure how a toddler is only going to swallow one half of a whole stone. Regardless, that&#39;s not a lot for anyone. I&#39;m guessing you probably need more than that small amount in this supposed cancer cure, but I digress that I have no real idea. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure, you can consume a small amount of most things once and be totally fine. Heck, Cody has a box full of uranium that he gets out every not and then and its to no ill effect. The issue I have with this is this guy is promoting taking an unknown amount of cyanide on what I assume to be at least a semi regular basis. Notice that even with a small amount of cyanide Cody experienced some symptoms. That&#39;s because no matter how much cyanide you take, your etc is gonna be affected to an extent. Neurons in your hippocampus for example are fairly sensitive to anoxia environments and therefore a lack of atp. You might get away with it a few times, but if you start chronically depriving sensitive cells there will be an effect even if it doesn&#39;t necessarily kill you. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow. My uncle had aggressive lung cancer that spread to his spinal column, we did everything. Every weird thing out there that claimed to cure cancer. All the research. Read every book. Spent ass loads of money in other countries. Bought herbs and supplements and produced our own pills. Stem cells. Bacterial therapies. </p>

<p>I know he used cannabis oil, but can&#39;t remember if he did the B17/apricot kernels.</p>

<p>We bought him a few extra years, but he died.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t even want to look into it. If we missed that and it actually is THE thing that works, that would make me feel much regret. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m gonna be optimistic here and hope this is just a troll. In any event this is so far off base it&#39;s not even funny. The fundemntal principle of cancer biology that you don&#39;t understand is that cancer is a many headed hydra, and the &quot;cure&quot; for cancer likely does not exist. I say likely because CRISPR editing of cytoxic T cells and other immunological therapies show some promise. The simple reason for this is any number of cell regulatory systems can fail resulting in cancer. The down regulation of growth inhibitors and the up regulation of growth factors provide a basic mechanism for cancers genesis, but other mutations must occur to circumvent the immune system and other processes which would stymie it. My point here being that some half cocked concoction will not sufficiently affect the multiple mechanisms required for cancer formation. </p>

<p>Furthermore, it is an objective and verifiable fact the vitamin b17 contains a cyanide group on it which will be released during metabolism via beta glucosidase. This action can be understood by anyone with any experience in biochemistry, and will cause inevitably bad things to occur. So this cute you&#39;re pedaling is a poison. </p>

<p>I am a biologist and researcher in Biology who is looking to be a physician so I am one of the evil ones you&#39;re talking about. I doubt you&#39;ll take me seriously, but I implore you to delete this as your advice has potential for harm and no basis in science. While big pharma may not always be scrupulous, the truth of the matter is that cancer has the upper hand for now, and there is no easy cure available that is somehow being repressed. </p>
