        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I have heard and speculated that smart devices such as phones eavesdrop on people and create their Internet ads and searches to be geared towards it, or worse.</p>

<p>Example: yesterday my sisters friend stopped by and somehow we got on the topic of ice trays. He mentions how his girlfriend bought a silicone ice cube tray, etc, and I say that I don&#39;t even own one tray.</p>

<p>Today my Internet ad suggestions shows images of three separate silicone ice cube trays that are on sale or whatever. I&#39;ve never typed or searched for ice cube trays in my life. I wasnt on my phone during this stupid conversation either. How is this just a coincidence?</p>

<p>Apologies if this is not the sub for this type of thing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Google and Facebook are listening for sure, for there ad service</p>

<p>we need to launch a backlash against the advertisers who ultimately benefit from their &quot;ROI&quot; on targeted advertising. </p>

<p>launch a boycott and a social media shit storm against the advertisers. </p>

<p>start new hashtags like #HeyFacebook or #OKFacebook to draw attention to the fact that Facebook is listening </p>

<p>with just one well-publicized success, we could move the needle on things like Facebook stock, especially with an exodus of their user base to other platforms </p>

<p>we could start new hashtags to promote leaving Facebook, and offering &quot;free software foundation&quot; recommended alternatives. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>to expand on this &quot;who is listening&quot;:</p>

<p>most of the time some form of algorithm, A.I.. Most of the data collected is not of immediate interest and exclusively handled by A.I.. (look up NLP, Natural Language Processing)</p>

<p>However, there are some key words and phrases that can trigger an alarm, triggering human supervision and permanent storing of the recordings.</p>

<p>This is why a lot of essential and important discussion isn&#39;t happening in public places anymore.</p>

<p>If someone has the look of &quot;I actually would love to tell you something&quot;, but doesn&#39;t - it is safe to assume, that he wants to talk about a topic, that would trigger this kind of alarm. (or maybe &quot;just&quot; a paranoid human...)</p>

<hr/>

<p>Who is this human, that is handling the supervision, working for? Good question. For the general public? Hard to believe ;)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I want to challenge people, and maybe start a &quot;thing&quot; to have people put on their favorite movie talking about 9/11 or fracking or weather related whatever and put and leave your phone next to it, listening.  Do that a few times just for funsies.</p>

<p>Anyway, if anything give the three letter agencies something to listen to.  If anything its a message right back at them, if you choose to do it, it shows that you&#39;re paying attention.  They would like to listen in to your convo&#39;s but instead all they get a dose of your fav video.  Like, nothing but AE9/11 truth audio coming back at them?  What would that say to them if enough people did it?</p>

<p>Maybe we can waste their time as much as they waste ours.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>every phone is a bug</p>

<p>they are listening for all kinds of background noises </p>

<p>if you flick a lighter, they will suggest a lighter</p>

<p>its not &quot;the government&quot; per se, but supposedly private corporations (which are publicly traded on the stock market)</p>

<p>so Facebook listens to your background noises, to pitch ads that are relevant to each user. </p>

<p>i mention i need laundry soap, i get a coupon for laundry soap as my next youtube ad</p>

<p>as the one supposed whistleblower on here, the air force guy, </p>

<p>said when he was asked if we are all on lists, he said no its not like that... its much worse</p>

<p>i suspect what he meant was that there was not some &quot;master list&quot; of &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot; that you are either on or not on...</p>

<p>but rather to say that everyone who has a social security number has a unique number as an identifier, which remains with you regardless if you change your name 5 times. </p>

<p>and attached to this social security number is a list of words that describe you. </p>

<p>its not &quot;if&quot; you are on a list, but rather &quot;which lists am i on?&quot;</p>

<p>so in theory all of this info is in the hands of private corporations, and the private corporations merely comply with court orders (or not) when giving this info to the government</p>

<p>combine that with what are called Fusion Centers, and you have local police with NSA level access to your info, for any reason, from stalking an ex-girlfriend, to gang-stalking you as a targeted individual </p>

<p>Most of the holders of the patent of a chip that was projected to become quasi ubiquitous in connected devices were aboard Malaysia Airlines MH370 that &quot;disappeared&quot;. After their death, freescale semiconductors got back the full ownership of the patent.</p>
