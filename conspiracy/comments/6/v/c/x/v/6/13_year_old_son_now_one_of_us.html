After 10 minutes of looking at pictures he came up to me and asked &quot;mom, where is the plane parts..why are there no bodies....wouldnt it have big scars in the ground from the wings....it does not look like any plane crash ever&quot; I just smiled and told him how good it was that he question these things and to never just believe something because someone told you it&#39;s true...
He spent the 2 hour drive home asking me questions and wanting answers.. .He is one of us now.</p>

<p>You know how all kids talk? a 12 year old is pretty smart already. Why can&#39;t a 12 year old use logic?</p>

<p>Considering their parent is posting on this forum, I think you&#39;re full of shit. The kid is taking on the same thinking as his father, which makes perfect sense. Either you parrot the narrative being shoved down your throat, or you question what you are being told and inquire further. You have no reason to be so skeptical, and the message is not heavy-handed... its just an anecdotal story.</p>

<p>You&#39;re the one that keeps claiming that I have some kind of anterior motive here.  I&#39;ve given a couple strong examples why this sounds like bullshit.  You&#39;re the one that seems to want to push the narrative.</p>

<p>That&#39;s logical.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not logical.  Ita not logical for a 13 year old boy scout to ask why there are no bodies at a 20 year old site, and it&#39;s not logical for someone to put that forward as an example of critical thinking.</p>

<p>He&#39;s asking where the bodies are in the pictures of the aftermath of the crash - not the site in it&#39;s current state.</p>

<p>Who is lacking in critical thinking here? why would you assume he was asking why there weren&#39;t body parts strewn after decades? you&#39;re being purposefully daft.</p>

<p>And my 12 yr old nephew already knows dinosaurs are fake. He told me that. Right now we are working on gravity.  You seriously have to teach them the opposite of what they pick up in school. But since they are all addicted to the internet their range of info is exponetially larger than even ten years ago. That&#39;s why its paramount to inform children of pseudoscience and government control over what they learn ,and how to think critically of their education instead of just passing tests.</p>

When you pose something to another in a constructive way you see the automatic denial people usually express. And they stop there. Just deny it. Deny deny deny. Nothing constructive in that. Nothing expansive about holding absolutes, either, as they are self imposed limitations.</p>

<p>Notice no one even asked how that could be fake or looked into it? First thing they do is deny. They have already lost their will to expand their worldview. </p>

<p>Ok, let me clarify where we are at. You just had said having an alternative belief carries no critical thought, so i asked you to actually prove dinosaurs are real. And  Not just some fabricated stuff from a time when attractions like those were inventions of creative people to make a few bucks. By Using bones and molds and anything they could think of to create them, and also creating a story to support their existence.  </p>

<p>My nephew calls it a circus attraction. Can you prove him wrong?</p>

<p>&quot; He told me that. Right now we are working on gravity. You seriously have to teach them the opposite of what they pick up in school. But since they are all addicted to the internet their range of info is exponetially larger than even ten years ago. That&#39;s why its paramount to inform children of pseudoscience and government control over what they learn ,and how to think critically of their education instead of just passing tests.&quot;</p>
