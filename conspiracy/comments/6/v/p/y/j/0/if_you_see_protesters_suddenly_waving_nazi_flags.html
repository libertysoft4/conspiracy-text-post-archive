<p>Our government has us in one for nearly 18 years, and apparently the rhetoric seems to drift towards warring tactics, and if you aren&#39;t fighting on the streets, you&#39;re a coward.</p>

<p>This is regressive thinking. We know who the enemy is, and it isn&#39;t poor Hispanics, poor blacks, poor whites. In fact, the color doesn&#39;t really matter. It&#39;s the amount of Cash and influence they have, and most poor people don&#39;t have that.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not scared, just always wary of my internet thumbprint and the fact that it doesn&#39;t take much anymore to do someone and ruin their career :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That was overly cryptic, but I&#39;ll make one last push to end this with some positivity. If you would stop assuming everything you think you know about me and simply ask what I mean when I say something we could avoid this whole negative feedback loop. I work in home construction/remodel. I <em>literally</em> build better lives for people. I volunteer with groups like Habitat for Humanity and Loaves &amp; Fishes. I give rides to hitch hikers, food to homeless people, and help to those who ask. I do this because this is the change I wish to see in the world. Now that I have &quot;made my actions clear&quot;, none of this is contrary to what I have stated prior, nor does it require me to go toe to toe with militant mobs, so I do not see where your point is made. </p>

<p>Please allow me to resolve this little logical conundrum for you. Spoiler alert: you are in the wrong.</p>

<p><a href="/u/SomeoneLikeYouToo">/u/SomeoneLikeYouToo</a> thought it was absurd for people to go to a Donald Trump rally in Boston to protest the actions of neo-nazis in Charlottesville. You later relevantly pointed out that overlapping speaker engagements made this less absurd, frankly winning the real debate over this point right there! However, I am a stickler for cold, dry logic, so your win will unfortunately not come into play in this analysis. Instead we must restrict ourselves to the premises that were at hand when you leveraged your inadequate accusation of the &quot;non-sequitur&quot; fallacy.</p>

<p>So, <a href="/u/SomeoneLikeYouToo">/u/SomeoneLikeYouToo</a> thought the premise for the demonstration was absurd. To illustrate <em>why</em> he thought it absurd, he constructed a parallel example that demonstrated the same error of logic that he thought could be seen in the Boston demonstration. The strategy being, if you could be made to agree that the parallel example contained obviously inconsistent logic, then it would follow that the argument for the Boston demonstration would be inconsistent as well if it followed the same inconsistent logic.</p>

<p>To this, you replied &quot;non-sequitur&quot;, as if by pointing out that <a href="/u/SomeoneLikeYouToo">/u/SomeoneLikeYouToo</a>&#39;s parallel example contained inconsistencies, you were thereby able to disqualify it as the starting point of a logical debate.</p>

<p>But those logical inconsistencies were the <em>point</em> of <a href="/u/SomeoneLikeYouToo">/u/SomeoneLikeYouToo</a>&#39;s example, and by agreeing that it is indeed ridiculous you have in fact agreed that the Boston demonstrators were equally ridiculous in their motivations - unless you can show that the two cases don&#39;t share the faulty logic! Which it turned out you could, with the speaker list argument, but alas that was too late with respects to your faulty usage of &quot;non-sequitur&quot;.</p>

<p>Hope that helped! </p>

And that wasn&#39;t even a big event with a lot of press coverage, although it did garner more attention because DHS came in because the rally was held in a federal park.

<p>I realize there aren&#39;t &quot;millions&quot; of Antifa, but there&#39;s definitely quite a lot considering how far-left they are on the spectrum. Look at Berkeley, there was a shit ton of them there.</p>

<p>If that&#39;s the definition then it&#39;s easy for those guys to make that decision, but having any sort of empathy to realize that there are incredibly dumb southerns who aren&#39;t racist and are terrible at expressing their frustrations with the current administration and political fervor that still surrounds it. They go to work, they go home, and then they watch the news. They get the fox scoop, and others get the MSNBC scoop and they are just absolutely crushed to watch literal Nazis and Stalinist march on their streets as if they are the only two movements in existence to represent the right and left.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe you missed this part</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They are agent provocateurs</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That statement answers your question. Why would they do it? Because <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agent_provocateur">those two words literally mean something</a>. They describe a type of person/people who &quot;play act&quot; in order to achieve an end result on society. </p>

<p>They exist. There is historical precedent to believe these exist, and a government that literally prints their own money has plenty of capital to pay people to fill these roles. The FBI/CIA/3-letter alphabet agencies have a long history of infiltrating groups by pretending to be apart of them. There is a lot of past evidence to believe that not only has this happened in the past, it never really stopped happening. </p>

<p>So the answer of &quot;why would they risk it?&quot; is because they&#39;re being paid and they thing they&#39;re serving whatever group they work for(both government and private such as masons, church of satan etc)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a history of using controversial symbols as a message of anti-authoritarianism even without directly supporting the &quot;intended&quot; message of that symbol. In the early days of punk, for example, swastikas were sometimes &quot;appropriated&quot;-- not because the punks were Nazis necessarily, but because they wanted to be shocking and controversial. When you were younger, you probably knew people who would draw pentagrams despite not actually being satanists. Similar idea. </p>

<p>There have also been efforts to &quot;take back&quot; the swastika. Before the Nazis, it used to be a symbol for Buddhism. Even today some east Asian cultures still use it in non-Nazi contexts. For example, a Pokemon card released in Japan has one on it and the US release of the card had to change it. I&#39;ve seen it suggested that we should use the swastika in non-Nazi ways like that to blunt the offensiveness of the image, but doing this would just result in people thinking you&#39;re a Nazi anyway. </p>

<p><em>Every</em> time a horrible incident occurs you can count on <em>someone</em> here to have a theory as to why it was fake, a false flag, etc. And for the most part, that&#39;s fine, because after all this is <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.</p>

<p>My point is that real attacks/incidents occur. Therefore, if some incidents are real, and every incident is portrayed as being fake, then we&#39;re ignoring some real attacks (Sandy Hook, anyone?).</p>

<p>The same argument applies here. You aren&#39;t even saying &quot;most&quot;, you just flat out say if anyone protests with flags or uniforms then it&#39;s clearly fake.</p>

<p>Even if a 100% real Nazi waves a Nazi flag, and it&#39;s definitely not a fake, the end result in public opinion is the same. I think the point op was trying to make is that you should basically assume they&#39;re acting in bad faith, because even if they&#39;re being honest, they&#39;re still acting in bad faith. </p>
