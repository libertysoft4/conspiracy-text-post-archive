    <div class="md"><p>Well first of all despite what many would have you believe it <em>is</em> physically possible once you account for all of the variables. </p>

<p>The beams don&#39;t have to melt to be weakened, and I&#39;ve yet to see any proof that the &quot;molten steel&quot; at the ground was any of the steel from the beams. For all we know it could&#39;ve been from a supply closet where loads of staples melted.</p>

<p>There&#39;s also the fact that the buildings was designed for vertical weight - not horizontal impact - and therefore the entire structure was compromised as soon as it was hit. The third tower was also hit at an odd angle by the falling tower, which was extremely heavy.</p>

<p>Onto who crashed the planes?</p>

<p>We all know that the majority of the hijackers were Saudis. There are many wealthy Saudis who could have funded this. Keep in mind SA was against Hussein&#39;s takeover of Kuwait before the first Gulf War, and were offered military services by bin Laden and his militia. Many felt this was the right way to go, but ultimately they were given a far better option of a half million troops from the US in return for oil. That didn&#39;t sit well with the entirety of the higher-ups in SA, and you can&#39;t rule out a sect going rogue and attacking the US. </p>

<p>Bottom line - I actually believe the official narrative on this one. I know that&#39;s unpopular, especially here, but it actually to me makes more sense than many theories that I&#39;ve seen written about.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think they have any particular facts other than the facts they were given in the days surrounding the attacks. That&#39;s where most people stopped. I know I did until I stumbled across some weird video and I realized I never questioned it. </p>

<p>Seeing the two towers fall like that from impacts and fire doesn&#39;t make any sense. There seems to be a connection between the idea that a plane hit the building and they way it collapsed that makes people believe it. If you take the plane out and just picture it as a bomb that went off in the same place I don&#39;t think anyone would have expected it to fall that way. It&#39;s like the planes+total collapse=what we would expect in an action movie so it must be true.</p>

<p>Sorry for rambling </p>

    <div class="md"><p>i can&#39;t accept the US government being smart and savvy enough to pull something like that off without more people leaking evidence.   Snowden walked out the front door of the NSA with the &quot;keys to the kingdom&quot; to our latest and greatest spying tech.   Or current white house has more leaks then a polish submarine.  My own experience working in a federal job and serving in the military had shown me how incredibly difficult managing a giant beauracracy is.</p>

<p>In the army we called it &quot;Man on the moon syndrome&quot;.  Every country we were deployed in held the common belief that we could solve all their problems we just don&#39;t want to.   If we could put a man on the moon we can do anything.   The truth is we just arent that good at &quot;Nation Building&quot;.</p>

<p>I still believe in some conspiracies but these massive ones that require large scale coordination and silence from thousands of people area always a stretch for me. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, I hear this one a lot. It&#39;s based on a false premise though.</p>

<p>1) it wouldn&#39;t take very many people to pull off. Every job is based on time, not man power. </p>

<p>2) those involved would be compartmentalized.</p>

<p>3) you are assuming that US contractors would be utilized to carry out the attack and therefore be able to leak information.</p>

<p>4) repurcussions for breaking silence is always a factor, and if YOU were putting together a top secret operation, would you pick people who display the psychological markers for leaking information?</p>

<p>5) when leakers present themselves, they are labelled liars, charlatans, or wackos.... you wouldn&#39;t even listen due to your preconceived bias on the subject, so how would you know? </p>

<p>Former NIST employees have come out against the official story. Two lead commissioners OF the commission report have called it &quot;set up to fail&quot;. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.quora.com/Was-the-NIST-report-on-9-11-about-the-WTC-cause-of-collapse-flawed-and-set-to-fail-as-former-NIST-employee-Peter-Michael-Ketcham-affirms">https://www.quora.com/Was-the-NIST-report-on-9-11-about-the-WTC-cause-of-collapse-flawed-and-set-to-fail-as-former-NIST-employee-Peter-Michael-Ketcham-affirms</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>So basically it woukd require a Shadow Government that regular government employees are not aware of.  Would that include the President and member of his staff?  Would future Presidents be aware or would they just be puppets kept in the dark?</p>

<p>Im not trying to be condisending but i just have trouble believing how small you could keep the circle of people in the know.  Someone had to manage getting the planes (different ones or thr ones that took off from their respective airports?).  The air traffic controllers, the passengers, the captains and flight crew, body disposal if the passangers werent on the plane.  Are we faking air traffic controller data?</p>

<p>Leakers are definately gonna face scepticism regrdless of what their leaking or who its from.  Snowden came prepared and walked away with all the evidence needed to bring the scope of NSA spying capabilities to light.  Its unfortunately expected that leakers have a high standard of evidence to present or else they get ignored.</p>

<p>If any of the leakers you mentioned were legit, i assume the people behind 9/11 would have had them killed as well.  What difference would a few more bodies make?</p>

<p>The end goal is also a little murky for me.  The military industrial complex doesnt really need to commit somerhing like that for congress to suck their dick, its already par for the course.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All it would really take is a handfull of high ranking officials, the buildings owner, and a small demo crew (military contractors could handle this). </p>

<p>As far as air traffic controllers, no.. no need to include them. There were so many funky things going on in this arena, I won&#39;t even attempt speculation. It would take me hours to disseminate all the strange. Look it up. Some think there were no planes at all, some think they were switched in air, some think they were just drones. I focus more on the holes than making up an alternative timeline. </p>

<p>Killing senators and governors that performed the official investigation, after they&#39;ve come out discrediting their own investigation would probably raise more eyebrows than just drowning them out, don&#39;t you think?</p>

<p>The end goals were pretty obvious imo. Finalizing a war started by the former Bush, insurance money, oil, poppy fields, public approval, and of course pushing the &quot;patriot act&quot; through. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>BEWARE, POPULAR MECHANICS LIES BELOW:</p>

<p>&quot;FACT: Once each tower began to collapse, the weight of all the floors above the collapsed zone bore down with pulverizing force on the highest intact floor. Unable to absorb the massive energy, that floor would fail, transmitting the forces to the floor below, allowing the collapse to progress downward through the building in a chain reaction. Engineers call the process &quot;pancaking,&quot; and it does not require an explosion to begin, according to David Biggs, a structural engineer at Ryan-Biggs Associates and a member of the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) team that worked on the FEMA report.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They cover some of the major conspiracies surrounding the towers and <em>how</em> they fell but they missed a lot. In my opinion, even if the towers did come down via planes there is still a bunch of unanswered questions.</p>

<p>For example, why didn&#39;t they go into the conspiracy claims about:</p>

<p>a) NORAD&#39;s 80 minute response time (visible in the official commission report)</p>

<p>b) The &quot;plane&quot; that hit the Pentagon happened to hit the same office that was investigating trillions in missing money and killed the majority of the analysts working on the case and most of the documents/files.</p>

<p>c) The FEMA drills/operation that was slated for that week and why FEMA was already there and set up on Sept 10th prior to the attack.</p>

<p>And there are a lot more. We just had two huge posts by users in the last couple weeks with tons of excellent information. I recommend going and reading those.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Personally, it&#39;s the fact that there were so many witnesses and recordings of the Twin Towers collapse that the basic facts are indisputable unless you find me some real damning evidence. The planes crashed into the buildings. The buildings caught fire and the floors where the crash happened began to collapse. The collapse brought down the upper floors which built momentum and crushed everything below them. So far I have yet to find anything convincing enough to tell me that those facts are incorrect. The vast majority of experts in structural engineering, aerospace, demolition, skyscraper architecture, terrorism, and material science agree on what happened with only a vanishing small minority &quot;questioning the official narrative&quot;.</p>

<p>Sure there have been many people who&#39;ve claimed smoking guns over the years. But each and every time they are debunked. Then the conspiracy theorists move on to something else and pretend that the first theory was &quot;disinfo&quot;. Like how 10 years ago, <em>Loose Change</em> was all the rage and made a huge fuss about &quot;jet fuel can&#39;t melt steel beams&quot;. That was quickly disproven (jet fuel can <em>weaken</em> steel beams) only for the theorists to move on to discussions about the collapse into the footprint. Again, this was shown to be fairly basic engineering based on how the Twin Towers were built. Then they moved on to Tower 7. Rinse and repeat. It&#39;s very obvious that 9/11 conspiracy theorists aren&#39;t people that found the circumstances suspicious and constructed a theory based on the flawed evidence, rather they believe in a theory without evidence then hunt for facts that would fit their theory retroactively. </p>

<p>Finally the sheer number of people to have been involved would make it nearly impossible to keep silent for this long about things. Even if the act were compartmentalized, each compartment would certainly know that <em>something</em> was up and after 16 years there&#39;s no way all of them would have been totally deathly silent on it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>All have to say in response to that is that the overwhelming vast majority of people with the capabilities and knowledge to investigate the topic have confirmed that two planes took down the Twin Towers and several surrounding buildings while a third crashed into the Pentagon and a fourth was downed by passengers. </p>

<p>You can&#39;t make exceptions for &quot;minor&quot; inconsistencies in physics or demolitions. If &quot;minor&quot; inconsistencies are present, it&#39;s a complete failure. You like absolutes, you should understand this. Thermodynamics doesn&#39;t allow for the events of that day. The manner in which the buildings fell and the flight manuevers and speed give away the lie. All of the other &quot;minor&quot; inconsistencies (read as physical impossibilities) are just more evidence against the official theory.</p>

<p>Speaking of theories, how do you like knowing that you subscribe to the pancake theory? It&#39;s completely unreplicatable in reality. People are risking their names and careers by calling out the inconsistencies while the investigators of the official theory won&#39;t even stand by their own work. Let that sink in.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m glad you mentioned that statement, it&#39;s a great example of another bit of criticism on 9/11 conspiracies. What the speaker was saying was that the whole commission was under such heavy scrutiny and so pointlessly politicized that it hindered them unnecessarily and prevented them from finding out some important <strong>details</strong>. Note the word <strong>details</strong>, because at no point did anyone on the Commission deny that the buildings collapsed due to planes flying into them, or claim that there were explosives in the buildings. In fact, they are all pretty firm that that&#39;s exactly what did happen, but were disappointed that they couldn&#39;t find out some of the smaller <strong>details</strong> like a better timeline for the terrorists&#39;s lives, or more evidence against Al Qaeda. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s not a minor inconsistency in the physics, it&#39;s a minor inconsistency on the exact manner in which the building fell. Perhaps the planes knocked out crucial supporting beams. Perhaps the jet fuel burned away the exterior before the interior. Perhaps the planes began their decent earlier. Again, the smaller details as to what happened don&#39;t match up exactly with what is believed to have happened, but they certainly aren&#39;t big enough to even reconsider the narrative.</p>

<p>The &quot;pancake theory&quot; was one theory popularized by Popular Mechanics. It makes sense from a mechanical perspective, but <a href="https://www.nist.gov/el/faqs-nist-wtc-towers-investigation">NIST disagreed</a> and settled on a very similar but different theory.</p>

<p>I would be extremely interested to see the models that your math is based off of. We might be able to save time and money by just flying planes into buildings or soaking them with kerosene. I&#39;m pretty sure those models aren&#39;t publicly available for whatever reason though.</p>
