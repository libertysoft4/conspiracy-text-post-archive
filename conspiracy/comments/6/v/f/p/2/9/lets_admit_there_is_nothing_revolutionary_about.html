<p>Voting for politicians (including presidents) means nothing when they are merely managers for their owners. Voting for a new manager, yet keeping the same abusive owner seems highly counterproductive, if you ask me.</p>

<p>The owners have diabolically crafted a system in which the people believe they can actually change or make a difference to it while being within it. I have seen plenty of owners fire their employees, I however, have yet to see any employee fire their company&#39;s owner. That&#39;s the system we are living in. We are the employees, and as such, have no rights merely privileges of the Corporation.</p>

The point is, we cannot change anything within this system the owner&#39;s have created, or else you end up like JFK. I&#39;m not truly sure if Ron Paul knew the extent of all of that or not. A huge part of me thinks, he didn&#39;t.

<p>The owners do indeed rape, steal, and murder us, but some are definitely the wiser.  The establishment makes sure these voices don’t get heard or get any real traction, however.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It’s no less evil than it is very intelligent - and it’s quite evil indeed.</p>

<p>Agreed.  Correct.</p>

<p>Correct.  Agreed.  Unfortunately.</p>

<p>After the Civil war, they basically had no idea who was alive or who was dead, so they just declared everyone to be &quot;dead/lost&quot; at sea which effectively makes us all criminals of the state and committing fraud on the daily (using federal reserve bank notes is also fraudulent). Which bring us to the 13th:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Abolishes slavery, and involuntary servitude, <strong>except as punishment for a crime.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>We are all considered criminals, because of the former. Hence why they can unlawfully kidnap and lock us up at any time. Which then brings us to the 14th:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Defines citizenship, <strong>contains the Privileges</strong> or Immunities Clause, the Due Process Clause, the Equal Protection Clause, and deals with post–Civil War issues.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We lost our birth rights: we are all <a href="http://thelawdictionary.org/corporation/">CORPORATIONS</a> with our fictitious <a href="http://thelawdictionary.org/capitis-diminutio/">CAPITIS DIMINUTIO</a>, on our certificate of birth, via our mother&#39;s <a href="http://thelawdictionary.org/berth/">BERTH</a> of us. Our mother&#39;s abandoned us to the State, unknowingly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I left America and work as a lawyer in china now, it&#39;s pretty great </p>

<p>America is in an economic death spiral and it can not recover, our GDP was at 1% for 8 years and when we needed real leadership on the issue all we did was talk about gender </p>

<p>If you want a better life learn mandarin and get a masters at Tsingua, it&#39;s free for Americans at the moment since our whiteness is still of value but eventually that will change</p>

<p>People need to accept the positive aspects of globalization which is that there is no actual reason for you to stay where you are living, any of you can leave, you can all get jobs teaching English in china for relatively high pay and use that as a way to eventually go to college in china for free and get high paying jobs in a field you like</p>

<p>Only thing holding you back is yourself </p>
