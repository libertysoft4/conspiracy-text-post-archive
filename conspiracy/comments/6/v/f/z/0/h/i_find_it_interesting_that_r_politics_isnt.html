<p>Yeah, the republicans are just as bad, been biching about Neocons since the early 2000&#39;s.  Hillary was also advocating putting thousands of troops in Syria as well.  This isn&#39;t a left vs right, it&#39;s a foriegn policy always seems to go in one direction.</p>

<p>The partisan politics is strong with you.  If you can&#39;t look at our foriegn policy and not recognize it as only lining the military industrial complexs pockets and to make areas of the world unstable, than you&#39;re lost.

<p>I never said that now did I? Do you enjoy fighting strawmen? I&#39;m saying that the two situations are very different. One party wanted to send in troops, the other didn&#39;t. </p>

<p>So you&#39;re agreeing with me, she said she wouldn&#39;t put boots on the ground. Trump said he would, IIRC. </p>

<p>And no, you don&#39;t need troops on the ground to fly planes in the air. The person who said it wouldn&#39;t work wasn&#39;t a general. And she clearly said it would be done with other nations who do have ground forces already. </p>

<p>Do some research. </p>

<p>Oh fuck off haha. I&#39;m pointing out that the &quot;both sides are bad&quot; bullshit ignores actual details and nuance. </p>

<p>The person brought up Hillary (I didn&#39;t) and stated a blatant lie (which even you can&#39;t argue against because I provided PROOF). I don&#39;t give a fuck about Hillary, it&#39;s people like you that are still DESPERATELY trying to defend Trump and the only way you can do that is attack Hillary. The election is over bud, time to move on. </p>

<p>You&#39;re anti war eh? So why do you support Trump?  He&#39;s making you look like a fucking idiot now. </p>

<p>That&#39;s you trying to attack a strawman you made up. </p>

<p>Do you think there&#39;s ZERO difference between putting ground troops in Syria and not putting ground troops?  Do you remember who wants ground troops? Trump and Republicans. </p>

<p>More strawmen! You&#39;re obsessed with using them. Can you actually make a solid argument or do you just make &quot;assumptions&quot; of what other people said and then attack that?</p>

<p>Syria is a complicated situation. There are people who believe we should never help when people are being killed by their own government and others that believe we have a moral responsibility to protect innocent lives regardless of country or race. </p>

<p>You seem to dislike the conflict. Which means I&#39;d assume you&#39;ve oven up supporting the right and Trump. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Partisan politics is a hell of a drug.  When have I ever supported Trump?  </p>

<p>When you spend every waking hour defending him and attacking Hillary (even when you need to pretend that they hold different views than they do). </p>

<p>Oh, and at least 30 posts in the_donald kind of give up the game 😂</p>

<p>&quot;Partisan politics is a hell of a drug&quot; said the guy desperate to claim liberals are doing what Republicans have actually supported. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>How many troops did we send into Syria again?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So you only think the US is involved if we have boots on the ground.  You don&#39;t consider providing direct support anf arming the various factions with weapons through Saudi Arabia &amp; Qatar does count?  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Which side wanted to send in troops? Oh right, Republicans.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah, the republicans are just as bad, been biching about Neocons since the early 2000&#39;s.  Hillary was also advocating putting thousands of troops in Syria as well.  This isn&#39;t a left vs right, it&#39;s a foriegn policy always seems to go in one direction.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Who has continued, arguably escalated the involvement? Trump.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I know, been pointing that out as well, and I&#39;ve been surprised by the left&#39;s ability to still argue for it.</p>
