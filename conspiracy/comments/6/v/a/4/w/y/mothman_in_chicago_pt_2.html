I had posted a couple months ago about all the Mothman sightings in Chicago. Since June the sightings have increased from 14-32  last time this forum gave me a brief intro to Mothman and some reading material to study and I loved everything about it. </p>

<p>Anybody want to make predicts why Mothman is around?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been sort of following this one too.  I thought it was more of a bat man type creature?  Anyway, aliens.  I&#39;m almost positive the thing is not of this earth the same way Bigfoot was not of this earth.  </p>

<p>Things like this happen from time to time.  For some reason, credible sightings of some weird creature happen and then they stop abruptly.  But this one is somewhat different in that the sightings are happening in Chicago which is a densely populated area.  In the past it was usually remote locations.  </p>

<p>In the case of Bigfoot and others I believe that who or what ever set them loose eventually comes back for them.  That is what I think will happen to this bat/moth man.  It will be taken back home.</p>

<p>here&#39;s a list of sightings from 2011 to the present. They span from bat-like humanoid to like a fully fledged giant insect most commonly described as moth-like. They even get crazier than that. Here&#39;s a recent link about a deer bat in Rockford lol.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.singularfortean.com/news/2017/8/18/deerbat-seen-outside-of-rockford-similar-to-chicago-flying-humanoid">http://www.singularfortean.com/news/2017/8/18/deerbat-seen-outside-of-rockford-similar-to-chicago-flying-humanoid</a></p>

<p>I think the numbers are getting conflated for this year. A lot of the sights saying 30+for this year reference the above link which goes back to 2011.</p>

<p>I have lived in or around Chicago my whole life. While there is indeed a lot of weird shit here with the large Vodou subculture (and other esoteric subcultures), radical political underground groups, and all the strange graffiti and happenings they create, I have never seen a cryptoid or met anyone who claims to. </p>

<p>That being said, if we&#39;re just here to guess what the mothman is here to warn us about: it&#39;s probably a nuke or, less likely, an event that may kick off a civil war.</p>

<p>Chicago is a prime nuke target if you only have one to use. I mean, of course we&#39;ll get hit with everyone else if an all out attack happens, but in terms of location and pop size, it would be the most effective use of a single one on our country. They could kill millions, freeze up rail traffic for months, and create a fall out cloud that would pollute most of the great plains and all of the great lakes. </p>

<p>the civil war thing comes from my Alan Moore fanboyness and knowing the culture here. In V for Vendetta, the civil war in America starts in Chicago for some reason. I have my guesses as to what Alan Moore was thinking <em>at the time</em>, but the most obvious one is how proud people are of the city. </p>

<p>Literally just about everything has the Chicago flag on it, including people&#39;s flesh, and just about any symbol you can think of has probably been mixed with this flag somehow to sell shit here. It&#39;s one of the most popular tattoos here. We joke that it&#39;s the only city where tourist shops make more money selling Chicago themed gear to locals than tourists. Being a Chicagoan is like a national identitiy in itself and, I think, it could remain as one even if the US national identity erodes. </p>

<p>Not to mention how powerful the Resist movement is here. I&#39;m telling you, if there are any Trump supporters here, they need only to look at the propaganda on light poles and alley walls to know they should probably keep it to themselves. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey guys,</p>

<p>Thanks for all the insight! Last week he was spotted twice in a 5 mile area from my house along a stretch of land that I find eerily creepy. Not only that but it has been a notorious place to find murder victims and missing people. It runs along the suburbs notorious to the homes of he old Chicago outfit. I wonder if all of this coincides with each other. </p>
