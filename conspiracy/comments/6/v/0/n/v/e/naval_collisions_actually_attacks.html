        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>After the first story emerged about a merchant vessel colliding with a US Naval ship I thought, &#39;well that&#39;s unusual given the sophisticated radar systems on board modern ships, especially military ships, but it&#39;s not impossible.&#39; </p>

<p>After reading this latest story, I&#39;m starting to think the US ships are being targeted by torpedoes/missiles/suicide bombers on speedboats and for some reason the media is agreeing to disseminate these &#39;accidental collision&#39; narratives. </p>

<p>Then again, the US military would almost welcome the provocation to justify unleashing a retaliatory barrage, so what purpose would it serve to weave a false narrative? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is the fourth incident this year over in 7th fleet.  There could be a lot of things we are not being told and it could be that the &quot;collisions&quot; are really cover-ups for what is really going on.  If North Korea or China was behind these incidents, the US wouldn&#39;t want the truth to come out and risk war.</p>

<p>Or, it could just be the fucked up Surface Ship culture where they don&#39;t take care of their sailors who are overstressed, highly under rested, and undertrained, while often, the command positions on these ships are given to combat sisters officers who have zero business being in command.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have been kinda wondering off it wasn&#39;t your first idea. That these are actual incidents, and they just sink the ship quietly and pretend like is an accident so we don&#39;t get into an open war. But they need to have an excuse to get off their planned mission so they can go to port and fix up.</p>

<p>Pure speculation, but we definitely have enough hostiles out that way. I think they are subs.</p>

<p>You can hear the audio leading to the event.  This one wasn&#39;t an attack.  </p>

<p>This is the DDG 78 - Porter, they were in heavily congested area and the captain fucked up.  It is incompetence.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m guessing incompetence is what happened to the others as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t say I know they all were incompetence, I said I hadn&#39;t heard their audio and guessing they were similar.  There are also other instances of incompetence, like a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/jan/30/us-navy-dismantle-minesweeper-coral">Navy minesweeper that grounded itself on a coral reef in the Philippines.</a></p>

<p>I was in the Navy and was actually on the Porter and knew most the crew when their incident happened.  I&#39;m not too surprised about huge fuckups due to incompetence and don&#39;t think they are as rare as the majority of people believe.  I think the government does a good job of sweeping much of their fuckups under the rug.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trying to dismiss these multiple US naval collisions as &quot;human error&quot; looks like disinfo to me.</p>

<p>The Chinese have stealth technology that <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-492804/The-uninvited-guest-Chinese-sub-pops-middle-U-S-Navy-exercise-leaving-military-chiefs-red-faced.html">the US doesn&#39;t understand</a>, and the Russians have electronics/radar jamming equipment that can <a href="http://www.voltairenet.org/article185860.html">completely disable US warships.</a></p>

<p>The obvious conclusion is that these US ships are having their radar disabled and there is nothing they can do about it. Washington is being sent a message to stay out of China&#39;s backyard, and the US military doesn&#39;t want to lose face by admitting it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;The McCain collision marks the fourth incident involving a US Navy warship in the Pacific this year.</p>

<p>On June 17, the guided-missile destroyer USS Fitzgerald collided with a container ship off the coast of Japan. That collision resulted in the deaths of seven US sailors.</p>

<p>On May 9, the guided-missile cruiser USS Lake Champlain was struck by a small fishing boat off the Korean Peninsula.</p>

<p>And in late January, the guided-missile cruiser USS Antietam ran aground while trying to anchor in Tokyo Bay.</p>

<p>All four of the US warships are equipped with the Aegis missile defense system, which has been touted as a possible defense against any North Korean missile launch that might endanger US forces and US allies in Asia.&quot;</p>

<p>Maybe NK or even China are attempting to compromise AEGIS, but proving that has been impossible. </p>

<p>I think so. This is being reported as the 4th such event by some reporters, even though it&#39;s only the second I know of. The Russian fly bys on our ships and our jets... </p>
