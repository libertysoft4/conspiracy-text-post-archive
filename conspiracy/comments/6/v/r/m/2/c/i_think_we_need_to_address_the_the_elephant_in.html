        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I felt i had to use a burner account for this text post because of my recent experiences on this sub. I&#39;ve been getting threats for taking part in open discussions regarding ANTIFA and all the drama surrounding free speech lately and a lot of the threats originate from this sub. Either a group of people or someone under different usernames have been going through my posts and comments and even managed to pinpoint my town of origin. </p>

<p>I personally don&#39;t really take the threats too serious since i have not posted anything identifiable about myself and don&#39;t fear any harm in real life, but being followed online and getting weird long messages in my inbox is kind of disturbing and especially when the person(s) come off as being total schizoids.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not being paranoid, but rather fed up after almost 3 weeks of this stupid shit. I&#39;m not in a nazi, fascist or any other ideological group. I&#39;m just observing what&#39;s going on and taking part in a discussion everybody SHOULD take part in without feeling they are getting silenced or attacked for not choosing a side. </p>

<p>Anybody else have a similar experiences or is it just me? I&#39;m open for a total civil and open discussion if this sub wants to address the real issues.</p>

<p>Peace &amp; love ya&#39;ll</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been dealing with the exact same thing on a variety of different controversial issues for longer than 6 years because of this subreddit.  And it&#39;s not the subreddit that is the problem, it&#39;s the people who are afraid of free speech.  They are so terrified that their MSM narrative will be exposed as wrong that they lash out at us for discussing these things.</p>

<p>They aren&#39;t necessarily shills (a stupid accusation) they are just invested in their own perception of reality.  It&#39;s hard to absorb the shock of learning &quot;I fell for it&quot;.</p>

<p>I think there are a multitude of reasons people have strong beliefs that they resist parting from.  Think about the racist 12 year old, it&#39;s most likely a generational indoctrination.  Versus the guy who only became racist at 30 years old, he probably had some personal experience that he attributed to race.</p>

<p>I wish it were a simple question with a simple answer because it would be easy to deal with if that were the case.  Unfortunately it&#39;s a complex series of questions, none of which have simple clear answers.</p>

My first reaction to op&#39;s post was, where&#39;s the screenshots of the messages? Idk man, you do what you feel necessary but in a sub like this, proof to back up your claims is crucial to giving legitimacy to your claims. This whole place is founded on research and facts; your dismissiveness of the other redditor asking for proof and &quot;TopMind&quot; remark is unnecessary; in my opinion after reading your exchange, you&#39;re full of shit until you prove otherwise. </p>

<p>You responded in the negative for screenshots before my recent comment on TopMinds** (where I was scolding the sub for ostracizing the crazy geostorm earthquake guy, which I thought was hilariously out there but showed positive qualities on behalf of the poster and harked back to the good ol&#39; days on this sub before the dumb dumbs started showing up, making claims without providing easy evidence etc), and I doubt I&#39;ve had any there previously for at least several comments page scrolls if ever. </p>

<p>You also didn&#39;t explain why you had no screenshots in your first response, you said &quot;it had been taken care of&quot; in reference to whether you reported him, and then gave some limpwristed rationale that you&#39;re just spreading the word (still without proof of your messages or an explanation for why you had no screenshots of messages that are still accessible on your account). Now you&#39;re trying to cover by saying you&#39;re choosing not to provide evidence for your claims because you disagree with a subreddit I&#39;ve visited, but that came after your first denial/obfuscation!  What&#39;s the story morning glory!  Post hoc ergo propter hoc!</p>

<p>**caveat: I may have more comments there that could be found with a bunch of scrolling or one of those Reddit stalker sites, if you were so inclined...I don&#39;t make any particular effort to censor myself out of fear of having underemployed mouth breathers getting scared off from engaging in critical thinking (in this instance, I am calling you an underemployed mouth breather)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The room is getting a little crowded with elephants.    Look,  when we get close to the point where the deep state and all the corporate money supporting it,  and the fact that the elite is so corrupt at this point that they are pretty much going to have to be put in prison to get the power away from them,   pretty much everything else,  especially identity politics and right and left and democrat and republican and Trump and Hillary etc.  etc.  is a <strong>FUCKING DISTRACTION</strong>.    And most of the bozos around here would just as soon as make their number one priority pedophilia or old statues or whatever the bs of the day is.    Once the main problem is addressed,  then the obvious criminality of pedophilia and crimes against the people can end,  but till we find a way to stop Citizens United and all that buying off of the top,  the control by the elite,  the rest of it is meant to distract,  and to keep us flitting about on details that are not going to change the basic problem.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t discuss it, don&#39;t read about, don&#39;t watch it on TV, don&#39;t click links about it.</p>

<p>The real elephant in the room is the deep state. They setup this problem so you&#39;d react. Don&#39;t react.</p>

<p>Its the concept of what happens if they had a war and nobody showed up?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It sure is annoying, but from what i&#39;m hearing from friends who also visits this sub it sounds widespread. It&#39;s just all so sad that your opinions should be a reason for threats or ridicule in some idiotic attempt to make you not speak your mind no matter if you are right, left, liberal or moderate and so on.</p>

<p>And most of the heated arguments are from left leaning people bringing up past events from a hundred years and back in time to prove how justified their cause is. You don&#39;t move forward as a society by dwelling on bullshit from the past and trying to dictate the future. Thats straight up propaganda and indoctrination.</p>

<p>But the issues need to be talked about even though i myself won&#39;t even make a significant impact i still welcome a proper discussion without the shouting and finger pointing.</p>

<p>Maybe it&#39;s all too far gone at this point in time</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are perfectly on point. The rift in both sides is pretty immense and the way of thinking of both groups is entirely different.</p>

<p>As much as you invite discussion and civility, I fear it is not reciprocal with the other group. The rare few that do usually start spouting bs and screaming lalalalala when faced with facts :(</p>

<p>That being said, I think we&#39;ll keep moving in the direction of truth and as we do, those one the other side will autoconvert because of their tribalism.</p>

<p>I dunno if you say that guy that &quot;looked like&quot; a &quot;neo-nazi&quot; in boston that got sucker punched, he was there to protest against &quot;neo-nazis&quot; (there were not any lol) and after he got up people asked him what he was gonna do and he looked really unsure if he wanted to stay at that point lol</p>
