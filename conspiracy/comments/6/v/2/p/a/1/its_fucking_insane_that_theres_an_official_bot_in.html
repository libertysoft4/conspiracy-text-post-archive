        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The truthfulness of this meme may vary on a case-by-case basis, but ultimately given how language and culture propagate it&#39;s a <strong>pretty fucking good heuristic</strong>, huh?</p>

<p>The bot activates on a hair-trigger (so while it acknowledges bias being complex, it&#39;s annoying, so the evident goal is to prevent people using the expression at all) and by way of refutation deploys some specious anecdotes that <strong>don&#39;t even undermine the saying</strong>. I&#39;ve never heard <em>anybody</em> object to the expression (a clear generalisation) before, why would anybody aggressively want people to stop saying it... unless this has a lot less to do with ancient history than it does with stopping people applying the comb to modern history.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Edit: several commenters claim that it&#39;s to prevent the expression being used as a lazy argument. I have never seen this. The bar for comments on <a href="/r/history">/r/history</a> is fairly high, and every post that I&#39;ve seen the bot reply to was either simply mentioning the expression or stating that the adage is applicable in a case <em>and then reasoning out why</em>. I don&#39;t remember ever seeing it being used as the basis of an argument. This is what I mean by hair-trigger, and part of why it appears to be directed at simply surpressing the phrase entirely.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Really? Coz I grew up in Florida and from the second the native americans were introduced the textbooks were hammering home the fact that they got fucked from the second the western world stepped foot on the new world. </p>

<p>Hell, wasn&#39;t even only the textbooks, but the movies they showed throughout my years in school also drove home that point.</p>

<p>Now I know that not every state/district gets the same books, but I&#39;m going to ASSume your own history classes weren&#39;t saying that native americans deserved it or that it wasn&#39;t the noble westerners that wiped them out or that most of the native killing happened in the southern countries. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh i messed up the first part as it&#39;s the other way around but the point is that if you control what people know about history in the present then history becomes entirely subjective, subject to manipulation such that it can provide a precedent to future action.

    <div class="md"><p>I took issue with your butchering of the quote. Both parts are wrong. It&#39;s a quote from 1984 and it read &quot;He who controls the past controls the future. He who controls the present controls the past.&quot;</p>

<p>I also disagree with your using it in this context. Fake history is a stupid concept and could really only be believed by someone who doesn&#39;t actually research history. There isn&#39;t some massive conspiracy among all modern historians to obscure the truth about the past. It would be impossible to contain and anyone who&#39;s spent any time in academic circles would understand why. There are deep divisions amongst historians about almost every aspect of their research and none can agree 100% on anything. A lot of them even hold personal animus toward one another because of their beliefs. This system works because it&#39;s democratic. The totality of the modern historical research field is pretty good at discovering a mostly accurate portrait of reality from a bird&#39;s eye view.</p>

<p>This quote may certainly have rang true in the past, but with how interconnected society has been since the industrial revolution, there really aren&#39;t many ways to completely obfuscate the truth about the world. The world is no longer groups of massive hegemonies ruling over vast swaths of people that are completely disconnected from their neighbors. In the same way that we know, basically, what&#39;s happening inside of North Korea and Iran, even though we have no direct connection to them, the recent past can&#39;t be effectively hidden by the victors on a long-term scale. In the short-term, of course things will be obfuscated, but given a long enough period of time, the truth will expose itself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I always facepalm at those who care more for the wording of a sentence than the content of it. It&#39;s almost as bad as those facebook arguments you see where a single typo gives reason for the other to completely disregard the point. Considering how intermingled cause and effect are does it really matter what order the words were in, read the sentence and judge what the words say; it does you no service to concern yourself over the particular way another person said much the same thing in the past unless you believe a person can truly own words.</p>

<p>I do not believe that censorship of history and state sponsered revisions of history are a thing of fantasy. I understand the picture that you paint of how the collective concept of history works, in my response i will use science as a a comparison since i feel that they are both fields that attempt to be objective.</p>

<p>The progress of science has been regularly waylaid by restrictions placed on the area of research and the selective allocation of funding throughout history. The version of science that reaches the masses does not avoid distortion from private parties with vested interests.</p>

<p>When a heliocentric model of the galaxy was proposed it did not recieve acceptance by the vatican as it conflicted with their perfect rendition of the heavens, likewise Professor Nutt did not keep his job long once he started talking about cannabis. 
The world accepted heliocentricity over time and i have hope that Britains legal stance towards drugs will change but if they don&#39;t his voice won&#39;t be the opinion being recorded and reviewed in 50/500 years time since it was completely denied a platform and any of his written material that lasts that long will most likely undergo countless revisions until it has lost all content of worth.</p>

<p>As for the internet, i can&#39;t help but feel that as it has increased our interconnectivity it has also increased the capabilities for these private parties to subvert the way we think (cultural identity, national history, societal norms, etc).</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure there are some people who are capable of discerning a form of truth regarding the events of the world but i very much doubt that this truth is being recorded in a fashion intended to be freely accessible to the public. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not making an attack on the idea of history, i&#39;m making an attack on the specific form of history that our regimes have pushed on us; a very biased and one sided form of history that can be constantly fitted up to suit whichever narrative appeals today.</p>

<p>It was just SJW propaganda by Wind Churchill in attempt to get more victim points. In reality propagating diseases was inevitable, Europeans came in with vaccines, guns and a boat that could cross an ocean, resisting was just a stupid idea.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That link just debunks the allegation that one epidemic in 1837 was caused by the U.S. Army distributing small pox blankets.  </p>

<p>It does not dispute claims of Europeans doing it when they were first exploring the continent or the more substantiated claim that they were used during the French and Indian War (1754–63).</p>

<p>The small pox vaccine wasn&#39;t invented until 1796 a long time after European settlers would have introduced it to Native Americans so they didn&#39;t bring vaccines with them at all.  The &quot;SJW propaganda&quot; was about the U.S. Army not Europeans.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The south lost and in doing so surrendered the right to secede that there was no legitimate Constitutional basis to prohibit or deny in the first place. That&#39;s what the war settled or rather forced into existence. </p>

<p>Moreover the war certainly didn&#39;t start and wasn&#39;t fought over slavery. That only entered into it much later in the game.</p>

<p>Read your history. The Fugitive Slave Act was in full force in all but a few states in the north that refused to comply with it prior to the Civil War whether they allowed slavery or not and there were still &quot;slaves&quot; in many wealthy homes and on large farms even in New York State right up until the Proclamation of Emancipation 1863, a full two years *after&quot; the Civil War had started. </p>

<p>The Confederate States weren&#39;t the only ones with slaves, there were many States on the Union side that did as well and despite a mish-mash of efforts to curtail the practice in any number of them there were actually no hard and fast rules to completely prevent it until the XIII  Amendment was finally and officially passed in 1865.</p>

<p>All wars are basically fought over property, wealth, and resources and the Civil War was certainly no exception.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re looking at this via Western/USA centric glasses based on what you learned in YOUR textbooks or what you think Asia is doing. Do you know anything about Asian politics? This isn&#39;t accurate at all.</p>

<p>Japan has been in hot water several times as recent as 2014/2015 for portraying events nicer than they actually were in their textbooks. It wasn&#39;t until international outcry they are slowly trying to fix it since early 2000s and the issue persists today because Japan changes things extremely slow. They depicted the events of their &quot;wins&quot; in Asia (especially in Korea) by downplaying how bad it was or outright omitted things. Sure, a Western textbook will point out every wrong thing Japan did during a time period of war, but their own books don&#39;t reflect that. I&#39;m sure there&#39;s other Asian countries that have done this. I know South Korea has controversies about their books as well, though, I&#39;ll admit I don&#39;t study SK politics much.</p>

<p>A lot of Asia hides and misconstrues recent political or war related events in their books because each country disagrees and recounts them differently. That&#39;s why something as &quot;stupid&quot; as a few sea rocks can ruin relations between countries. See <a href="http://www.npr.org/2012/09/07/160745930/little-islands-are-big-trouble-in-the-south-china-sea">here</a>. Even both Koreas refuse to call the Sea of Japan by that name. It&#39;s a big deal there. </p>

<p>Japan outright denied the &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comfort_women#History_of_the_issue">comfort women rapes</a>&quot; issue TWICE in the past decade despite admitting to the atrocity in the 90&#39;s. It wasn&#39;t until 2015 Japan finally did something about it via money, but money isn&#39;t what Korean women want - they want <strong>fixed textbooks</strong> and an apology. Something they still do not have as of TODAY. SK and Japan hold a lot of hate to one another and you won&#39;t see all those issues in your American textbooks. Most mentions of their conflict stops at the end of WW2 despite it existing today. </p>

<p>Japan is very much &#39;written by the winners&#39; in which, and as you may or may not know, Japan &quot;won&quot; often for a long time in Asia. Sorry your limited worldview prevents you from seeing this. Your version of Asian history was written by Westerners. Pick up two text books from different Asian countries involved in a conflict with one another. The events are not depicted the same. Look at recent past 100 year history to see biased narratives being taught.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey now, the Japanese can take some blame too. In fact...they could take a lot of blame. But I guess because many of us here are of European descent, that part of the war is even more veiled to us? The Japanese inflicted their imperial aggression on China a few years before the Nazis started getting violent with other countries. For the first few years, the Nazis were mostly beating on their own. Sicko weirdos that they were and all. But the Japanese were running cruel and inhumane experiments on hapless Chinese in 1937 via their Unit 731 . That stuff is just downright scary too when you look it up.</p>

<p>When you look at things these two countries did, you really have to wonder at the underlying psychology. Just utterly sick minded things and the men put in charge of doing these things...how? How does it come to psychopaths having the keys to all cities? What the hell is wrong with us as a species anyway? That&#39;s the big question to me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This isn&#39;t even a meme, though it&#39;s not viewed as one.</p>

<p>Christianity is a perfect example of &quot;history written by the victors.&quot; It&#39;s notable that the New Testament, covering a historical period replete with writers, historians, and commentators, so distorts and inverts ACTUAL history for its own theological/ religious intentions. </p>

<p>Case in point:</p>

<p>What was ACTUALLY happening in first century Palestine was a revolutionary, anti-Roman, hyper-Messianic form of Judaism that was causing headache after headache for the Romans and their puppet Kings in the area, the Herodians. </p>

<p>So what happens? They&#39;re annihilated, these &quot;zealots&quot; all massacred, crucified by the thousands by barbaric Roman governors, and their leaders are hunted down, their families hunted down, and executed.</p>

<p>ISN&quot;T IT QUITE STRANGE, that during all these revolutionary uprisings throughout Palestine, and the Jewish Messianic leaders all hunted down, along with their families, you have Paul, and his Greek/Roman consorts, writing letter after letter throughout the Mediterranean, to people OUTSIDE OF PALESTINE, who wouldn&#39;t know any better about Jewish Messianism, and they could freely distort, twist, write their own version of events.</p>

<p>Once it was all over, the enemies of Rome are dead. You&#39;re only left with this peaceful, PRO-ROMAN, spiritualized version of &quot;messianism&quot;, which became Christianity, instead of the HYPER ANTI-ROMAN, earthly Messianism the Jews were fighting for in the first century.</p>

<p>Really activates the almonds, doesn&#39;t it? The Vatican has records dating back from before &quot;The Church&quot; was solidified. It knows the true history, and they do not want it out there. Because if it was ou there for everyone to see, it would be clear as day that &quot;Christianity&quot; as we know it, is a fucking lie told by a single dude, Paul the Roman, on behalf of the Romans.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Unfortunately, most of what Jesus is said to have said has the flavor of retrospective additions, rather than accurate sayings. What is more likely is that the Pauline &quot;spiritualized Jesus Christ&quot; where &quot;Faith&quot; rather than Righteous works are emphasized was thought up by Paul, and then put into the mouth of Jesus.</p>

<p>The actual historical Jesus, if one investigates the situation of first century Palestine, and Jesus&#39; family, which the New Testament very artistically glosses over and writes out of the narrative, what is more likely is that the historical Jesus, whoever he was, was a militant, uncompromising, unyielding Jewish Zealot that had mass support, as his family members had immediately following when Jesus is said to have been killed.</p>

<p>It really creates a conundrum. Because Jesus really does have beautiful, amazing ideas, and sometimes even Paul does in his letters - but then you realize that that was all part of the trick... they created this Superhuman, Perfect Redeemer Figure that spreads nothing but love and forgiveness and meek and mildness...</p>

<p>All to calm down a hyperviolent, hyperrevolutionary Jewish population that was not about to submit to Roman rule. It&#39;s very, VERY telling that in Paul&#39;s letters, he&#39;s very anxious to tell his readers that you should pay your taxes to the Romans, because if they are in charge it&#39;s because God wants them to be in charge, and the Gospel writers even have Jesus echo this exact sentiment, &quot;Render unto Caesar what is Caesar&#39;s,&quot; the implication being, you should be okay with Roman rule, just be a good person. The Jews at the time, if the Jesus WE KNOW actually said this, would have stoned him on the spot and thrown him out of the city for being so clearly a Roman agent. [And wouldn&#39;t you look at that, Paul even admits he was beaten and attacked by mobs for this exact reason, being lenient about Jewish laws and trying to tell everyone that circumcision isn&#39;t that big a deal]</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What you said seems to resonate with the writing of Ralph Ellis and others who decribe the cover-up and cover-up of a cover-up, respectively.</p>

<p><a href="http://edfu-books.uk/">Ralph Ellis</a>:</p>

<p>&quot;Why are so many of the famous biblical characters missing from the historical record? Thirty years ago, the intrepid and dogged researcher Ralph Ellis decided to find out.  Does this biblical lacuna mean that both the Old and New Testaments are fictional, as many people have claimed? Or are we simply looking in the wrong locations or perhaps even the wrong eras?</p>

<p>...<strong>the historical Jesus-character was a king, just as the gospels claim, a valiant king with a large treasury and lofty ambitions to take over the Roman Empire.</strong> Which is why Jesus (Izas) was jailed alongside revolutionaries who had committed murder in the revolution. (Mk 15:7)</p>

<p>Perhaps readers can now see why the gospels were written in the manner they were. Rome did not appreciate revolts in its eastern realms, and sought to quell all thoughts of further unrest.  So the martial monarch called King Jesus (Izas) of Edessa became known to the wider world as a pauper prince of peace, who happily paid his Roman taxes and turned the other cheek. The industrious Roman propaganda machine that Josephus Flavius had created, had worked like a charm. &quot;</p>

<p>Another source <a href="http://lenaeinhorn.se/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Jesus-and-the-Egyptian-Prophet-12.11.25.pdf">here</a>, emphasis mine.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In particular, <em>those who put together and edited the Gospels</em> may have wanted to remove Jesus from the political setting in which he, according to this hypothesis, was active: the beginning uprising of ”robbers”, of Zealot rebels, often with a messianic leader at the helm. It was <em>a violent uprising</em> targeted primarily against the Romans, but also against the established Jewish leadership, the Pharisees and the Sadducees. </p>

<p>Whatever its roots, <em>by the time Christianity spread around the Mediterranean, it was a religion that advocated non-violence,</em> a view that permeated its approach to the demands and decisions of human existence. Likely, this attitude to life was present also during the formative years. But perhaps the persistent strain put upon the masses living under on - again - off - again foreign occupation in Judea and Galilee, and <em>the recurring disappointments when periods of hope invariably ended in despair, ultimately led to violent rebellion.</em> As Josephus laments, “God ... brought the Romans upon us, and threw a fire upon the city to purge it; and brought upon us, our wives, and children, slavery, as desirous to make us wiser by our calamities”. ( A.J. 20.166) </p>

<p>The scattered sprinkling of references to ”robbers” and uprisings still found in the Gospels could perhaps be <em>the remnants of a story that could not be told, at least not overtly.</em></p>

<p>But i wonder about the unknown examples. The lost histories and libraries of europe, and what was not chared from the Irish sanctuaries where we get 90% of what was left of Rome&#39;s intellectual might, after the dark ages.</p>

<p>Then as I mentioned before there&#39;s China...</p>

<p>Also Russia, which I know little to nothing about, other than when the Royalty was overthrown, I imagine many old documents and literature got &quot;misplaced&quot;</p>

<p>I also imagine what South America had available, is likely very similar to what we find in Egypt. It&#39;s just harder to find in a jungle vs a desert.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure what you mean by &quot;enshrine slavery above states rights,&quot; but it seems like a subjective emotional judgment on the importance of the institution of slavery. The right to hold slaves was one of the motivating factors in the secession movement, but it certainly was not the only one, and the cure for the ills of slavery was certainly not best fulfilled by a war in which up to 800,000 Americans, Northerners, Southerners, blacks, and whites, soldiers and civilians alike came to unceremonious premature ends. The war happened because Lincoln wanted economic control over the South. The issue of slavery was at the time a secondary or tertiary issue, and served as nothing but a post-war justification for the atrocities sanctioned by the tyrant Lincoln against his own people in the Southern states like burning down entire cities, looting homes, raping women and killing Innocents. And I&#39;m not talking about &quot;plantation owning elites&quot; here, I&#39;m taking about the 97% of white Southerners with no sin to their name other than being born in the &quot;wrong&quot; state. </p>

<p>But yeah, tell yourself it was all worth it despite every other nation on Earth completing the same virtuous objective of ending slavery without shedding a single drop of blood. As long as it helps you sleep.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;re right. Lincoln fought to keep the country unified under the economic oppression of the northern states and against the will of the Southern people. In other words, not in order to free the slaves, although admittedly that was an outcome of the war among other outcomes.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Your point about avoiding bloodshed makes no sense considering the fact that the Confederacy formed an army, then fired the first shots of the war.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lincoln sent warships to Fort Sumter and goaded the South into firing against them. The South formed an army for the same reason any country would. To protect their citizens and their interests. I&#39;ve no idea how anyone would consider that objective malign.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The north fought to stop the south from seceding, the south seceded primarily because they opposed the abolishment of slavery. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, again, you&#39;re taking the one wedge issue and trying to insist the war was justified by it. It wasn&#39;t about slavery, it was about dollars and cents. Slavery was part of the economy, and thus part of the dialogue. The North fought for economic hegemony over the South, and later made slavery a grounds for conquest to prevent the British from aiding the South during the war.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It was worth it to keep the country together, and it was worth it to end slavery even one day sooner if it did.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So you&#39;re pretty happy with the state of the country right now? And you&#39;re saying 800,000 lives was worth black slaves working for one extra day?</p>

<p>This must be the inanity of political correctness run amok.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, there was no impending abolition of slavery, and in fact Congress passed in 1861 a constitutional amendment that would have forbidden the federal government from interfering with slavery.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The first section of the document simply lays out the history and establishes that states have the right to secede if the compact is broken or the government becomes unjust.</p>

<p>Then, the document goes into how the compact is being broken:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the present case, that fact is established with certainty. We assert that fourteen of the States have deliberately refused, for years past, to fulfill their constitutional obligations, and we refer to their own Statutes for the proof.</p>

<p>The Constitution of the United States, in its fourth Article, provides as follows: &quot;No person held to service or labor in one State, under the laws thereof, escaping into another, shall, in consequence of any law or regulation therein, be discharged from such service or labor, but shall be delivered up, on claim of the party to whom such service or labor may be due.&quot;</p>

<p>This stipulation was so material to the compact, that without it that compact would not have been made. The greater number of the contracting parties held slaves, and they had previously evinced their estimate of the value of such a stipulation by making it a condition in the Ordinance for the government of the territory ceded by Virginia, which now composes the States north of the Ohio River.</p>

<p>The same article of the Constitution stipulates also for rendition by the several States of fugitives from justice from the other States.</p>

<p>The General Government, as the common agent, passed laws to carry into effect these stipulations of the States. For many years these laws were executed. But an increasing hostility on the part of the non-slaveholding States to the institution of slavery, has led to a disregard of their obligations, and the laws of the General Government have ceased to effect the objects of the Constitution. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The document spells it out as clearly as can be: South Carolina believes the compact has been broken and secession is justified because the non-slaveholding states are not upholding the laws with regards to slavery, specifically calling out aspects of the Fugitive Slave Act.</p>

<p>The question is what caused the Civil War. The south clearly seceded because they felt slavery was under attack.</p>

<p>You&#39;re welcome to argue that the Civil War was wrong, but that&#39;s a separate issue.</p>

<p>I think it was GA and SC that were the first to basically say &quot;Nah, under states rights we can have slaves&quot; and Congress responded &quot;Well... We technically cant stop you from doing that but we can certainly hurt your bottom line by levying high taxes, penalties and fees for doing so&quot;</p>

<p>This was followed by the first attempt to end slavery, the Act of 1807. Part of the bill</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;not be lawful to import or bring into the United States or the territories thereof from any foreign kingdom, place, or country, any negro, mulatto, or person of colour, with intent to hold, sell, or dispose of such [person] ... as a slave, to be held to service or labour.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The big catch was what about slaves that were brought here illegally and found in states where slavery was legal? Well they couldnt be set free and no one wanted to foot the bill to send them back to Africa so they were kept as slaves even if they were brought here illegally. </p>

<p>There were constant amendments to this law over the next few decades but the straw that broke the camels back was when America started expanding west. The southern states were like &quot;Cool we can setup shop here and start bringing our slaves westward!&quot; the US gov was basically like &quot;No you cant...&quot; </p>

<p>Well southerners wanted to capitalize on the bounty of the west in the only way they knew how, with slave labor. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>While abolitionists were gaining power, especially at the state and local level, many northern politicians still wanted to preserve the union at all cost. They knew that slavery was the fundamental issue that led to secession, so they hoped to bring the country back together by more forcefully protecting slavery in the southern states.</p>

<p>This did not work, the slave states seceded anyways, and the Civil War ensued.</p>

<p>Everything you point to only furthers the argument that slavery was at the root of everything. You&#39;re pointing to a blue sky and calling it green.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A state in the confederacy was forbidden from abolishing slavery. Clearly, it was more important to ensure that slavery was never abolished than it was to allow states the right to determine for themselves whether to allow slavery.</p>

<p>You seem to be arguing that abolitionists should not have fought to end slavery, or that the north should have let America split. Those are separate issues from the causes of secession.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I suspect the point is that just saying that the &#39;winners write the history books&#39; doesn&#39;t actually do a proper job of describing historical circumstances.  In other words, even if the winners <em>do</em> write the history books, that doesn&#39;t mean that these books accurately portray history.</p>

<p>If we rely on platitudes then we willingly allow ourselves to be swayed by dominant narratives. </p>

<p>That said, I&#39;m having trouble understanding why this is in this sub. One would think a view of history that challenges the books and the winners is exactly the attitude that conspiracy folks would champion.</p>

<p>Is that &quot;meme&quot; ever used as a way to say &quot;the history is right&quot;? I&#39;ve only ever heard it used, and it used it myself, as a means of saying that history is biased. </p>

<p>A relevant example: Robert E. Lee is only a traitor because the south lost. If history was written by the south, or the south has won, we&#39;d have a different history of Lee in the books. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure, I guess my point is that the &#39;winners write the books&#39; thing is just an ineffective and pointless thing to say. r/history is big on well-researched and deeply sourced arguments. Most academic historians I know are also very much committed to confronting their biases as best as possible and weighing really diverse sources of information. I don&#39;t really think their aim is to silence opposition, but to maintain a certain standard regarding the level of discourse. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not that I don&#39;t see how closely related the slavery debate and the states rights were AT THE TIME, but a discussion about one does not automatically need to include a discussion about the other in 2017. </p>

<p>Ron Paul, for example, was very much in favor of states deciding far more for themselves than the federal government.  Nowhere, however, did his platform include putting anyone in chains.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course.  I&#39;m not arguing against that.  What I&#39;m saying is that we shouldn&#39;t throw the baby out with the bath water.  There is a strong case that can be made in favor of states rights as opposed to federal power.  However, in 2017, that case does not need to involve, promote, or excuse any racist behavior or slavery.</p>

<p>What I&#39;m getting at is that States Rights were part and parcel with slavery at the time, but what everyone misses beating the drums of anti-slavery is that, perhaps, they had a point about states rights, it was just marred in a horrible thing like slavery.</p>

<p>I agree, in terms of the Civil War, it&#39;s difficult to differentiate the two (which is why we&#39;re having this discussion), but in modern times I tend to think we should be mature enough to have a conversation about states vs federal level politics without drudging up accusations of wanting to bring slavery back.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t talk to historians much then. People often state it not as a &quot;clear generalization&quot; but as a historical truth. Go to <a href="/r/askhistorians">/r/askhistorians</a> about it, they&#39;ll give you some clear answers.</p>

<p>Well, it&#39;s not. It&#39;s triggering on all uses of the phrase, of which the poor arguments outnumber the good ones.</p>

<p>Likewise there were many carvings and written records of ancient Babylon, Assyria and Persia, but a huge part of how they&#39;ve been perceived historically has been colored through a lens informed from the Jewish Torah. The Israelites were absolutely roflstomped by all three of them, but because they kept a well organized written account and it was propagated widely through the Christian Bible, we&#39;ve had their account &#39;write history&#39; up until the 19th century when archeologists started to seriously investigate those areas.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>History is nothing more than a pack of lies we all agree on. Further the history books are mostly propaganda written by the victorious in war to make the defeated look like villains. War does not determine who is right, but who is left. If only victorious LIARS write history why bother reading their lies? To keep track of which victorious liars wrote the most recent version of lies? History stretching back thousands of years is more than lies piles on top of more lies. It is not logical to believe liars. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re looking at this via Western/USA centric glasses based on what you learned in YOUR textbooks or what you think Asia is doing. Do you know anything about Asian politics? This isn&#39;t accurate at all.</p>

<p>Japan has been in hot water several times as recent as 2014/2015 for portraying events nicer than they actually were in their textbooks. It wasn&#39;t until international outcry they are slowly trying to fix it since early 2000s and the issue persists today because Japan changes things extremely slow. They depicted the events of their &quot;wins&quot; in Asia (especially in Korea) by downplaying how bad it was or outright omitted things. Sure, a Western textbook will point out every wrong thing Japan did during a time period of war, but their own books don&#39;t reflect that. I&#39;m sure there&#39;s other Asian countries that have done this. I know South Korea has controversies about their books as well, though, I&#39;ll admit I don&#39;t study SK politics much.</p>

<p>A lot of Asia hides and misconstrues recent political or war related events in their books because each country disagrees and recounts them differently. That&#39;s why something as &quot;stupid&quot; as a few sea rocks can ruin relations between countries. See <a href="http://www.npr.org/2012/09/07/160745930/little-islands-are-big-trouble-in-the-south-china-sea">here</a>. Even both Koreas refuse to call the Sea of Japan by that name. It&#39;s a big deal there. </p>

<p>Japan outright denied the &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comfort_women#History_of_the_issue">comfort women rapes</a>&quot; issue TWICE in the past decade despite admitting to the atrocity in the 90&#39;s. It wasn&#39;t until 2015 Japan finally did something about it via money, but money isn&#39;t what Korean women want - they want <strong>fixed textbooks</strong> and an apology. Something they still do not have as of TODAY. SK and Japan hold a lot of hate to one another and you won&#39;t see all those issues in your American textbooks. Most mentions of their conflict stops at the end of WW2 despite it existing today. </p>

<p>Japan is very much &#39;written by the winners&#39; in which, and as you may or may not know, Japan &quot;won&quot; often for a long time in Asia. Sorry your limited worldview prevents you from seeing this. Your version of Asian history was written by Westerners. Pick up two text books from different Asian countries involved in a conflict with one another. The events are not depicted the same. Look at recent past 100 year history to see biased narratives being taught.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not that I don&#39;t see how closely related the slavery debate and the states rights were AT THE TIME, but a discussion about one does not automatically need to include a discussion about the other in 2017. </p>

<p>Ron Paul, for example, was very much in favor of states deciding far more for themselves than the federal government.  Nowhere, however, did his platform include putting anyone in chains.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s not really the full truth of the matter...I mean I 100% agree that most Hollywood movies over drew American heroism, but to say it was just the Soviets are the reasons the US came in is rediculous. Not to mention it wasn&#39;t the Soviets attacking the US that started the engagement. Hell there was more than enough pressure being put on from Germany that it&#39;s the only excuse even needed. (<em>See Mexico and sinking ship in the Atlantic</em>), not to mention Japan and China, or hell even the war of idiology (<em>Democracy vs Fascism vs Communism</em>).</p>

<p>But also to be fair, the US was the tipping point in why the Allies were so successful. Without the help of the US we would live in a completely different world and probably not under a democratic regime.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ugh.</p>

<p>Hollywood isn&#39;t writing history you turd.</p>

<p>Anyone who actually bothered to do even basic reading into how the history field works, would know that history is actually &quot;written&quot; by the people who do extensive research on every piece of information available and use it to form a complete picture of what we know.</p>

<p>The soviets won WW2 but we know that they raped their way across East Germany because Historians have cross referenced journals from soldiers on both sides, victims of the soviets, propaganda reports given by the German government, and the official reports compiled by both governments.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Everyone thinks they&#39;re doing the right thing. Ideologues get swept up in that and tend to be the most likely to cause the biggest changes and becoming leaders ultimately defining the good and bad of an era. Hitler and Stalin both saw themselves as saints who had to work in the real world, but the nazi who executes the degenerate and the communist who starves the Ukrainian knows that that is not reality, and is kept there by forces that would kill him for doing otherwise, justified by the same detached leadership.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Unfortunately, most of what Jesus is said to have said has the flavor of retrospective additions, rather than accurate sayings. What is more likely is that the Pauline &quot;spiritualized Jesus Christ&quot; where &quot;Faith&quot; rather than Righteous works are emphasized was thought up by Paul, and then put into the mouth of Jesus.</p>

<p>The actual historical Jesus, if one investigates the situation of first century Palestine, and Jesus&#39; family, which the New Testament very artistically glosses over and writes out of the narrative, what is more likely is that the historical Jesus, whoever he was, was a militant, uncompromising, unyielding Jewish Zealot that had mass support, as his family members had immediately following when Jesus is said to have been killed.</p>

<p>It really creates a conundrum. Because Jesus really does have beautiful, amazing ideas, and sometimes even Paul does in his letters - but then you realize that that was all part of the trick... they created this Superhuman, Perfect Redeemer Figure that spreads nothing but love and forgiveness and meek and mildness...</p>

<p>All to calm down a hyperviolent, hyperrevolutionary Jewish population that was not about to submit to Roman rule. It&#39;s very, VERY telling that in Paul&#39;s letters, he&#39;s very anxious to tell his readers that you should pay your taxes to the Romans, because if they are in charge it&#39;s because God wants them to be in charge, and the Gospel writers even have Jesus echo this exact sentiment, &quot;Render unto Caesar what is Caesar&#39;s,&quot; the implication being, you should be okay with Roman rule, just be a good person. The Jews at the time, if the Jesus WE KNOW actually said this, would have stoned him on the spot and thrown him out of the city for being so clearly a Roman agent. [And wouldn&#39;t you look at that, Paul even admits he was beaten and attacked by mobs for this exact reason, being lenient about Jewish laws and trying to tell everyone that circumcision isn&#39;t that big a deal]</p>
