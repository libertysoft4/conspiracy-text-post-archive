<p>You are playing right into the very thing you claim you don&#39;t &quot;fall for&quot; and is &quot;phony&quot;. The Seth Rich conspiracy is <em>not</em> right wing. I consider myself a Libertarian (and would have voted that way of Johnson wasn&#39;t a doofus). My brother is a full on Socialist (not even Bernie socialist, <em>true</em> socialist). My cousin is out rioting with the fucknuts Antifa. </p>

<p>They all believe there&#39;s more to the Seth Rich story than we&#39;re being told. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for this - I fall into the some of the same boats. Crimes like murder and espionage are not &quot;right&quot; or &quot;left&quot;. In fact we don&#39;t even have a real &quot;left&quot; in this country if we&#39;re to be honest. But splitting things up like that sure does a good job of turning facts into opinions and crimes into innuendo. It&#39;s a very effective tactic.</p>

<p>Still - I wish CIA all the best and hope he&#39;s made it through.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re totally missing my point, which doesn&#39;t surprise me considering how you dismiss something using the very thing you claim TPTB are using to divide us. </p>

<p>Let me spell it out. You said the &quot;left&quot; and &quot;right&quot; dichotomy is being used to divide the people, presumably believing that&#39;s a bad thing. You then go on to describe the Seth Rich conspiracy as a &quot;right wing&quot; thing. </p>

<p>So you basically just did what TPTB wanted you to do -- you used left and right wing to divide people, presumably something you think is bad. But maybe you don&#39;t, because you apparently have no problem doing it when it suits you. </p>

<p>But by continuing to phrase everything as &quot;left&quot; and &quot;right&quot;, you just play right into their hands. And, again, it&#39;s something you&#39;ve claimed to be against. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If i were in a really bad place, emotionally speaking, as a result of a brain tumor, maybe i&#39;d be angry at the world and lash out? Pick fights?

<p>From what I read from his original post it was brain tumor removal. Could that possibly cause him to have to re-learn speech and walking and all that? Does anyone know more details about what he was going for?</p>
