    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t like getting my politics from Washington Post but I do believe their investigative journalism is top notch.</p>

<p>Washington Post did a good job at shutting Project Veritas down. Haven&#39;t really heard anything from them lately. They dug up tons of information about the girl trying to lie and wrote an article outing them. Even had a video of the woman lying through her teeth. </p>

<p>Washington Post corrected CNN on the story they got wrong a few days ago.</p>

<p>and Washington Post was the one that broke the &#39;Clinton Cash&#39; story</p>

<p>The editorial board and opinions may be left leaning (Though Trump has written opinion pieces on Wapo before) but their investigative work is really well done.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would guess there is a component of the news agenda being driven exogenously, but also this is probably just a symptom of repeatedly making business decisions on a quarterly basis: you compromise your integrity enough times pushing whatever sensational crap will get the ratings (and ad dollars) at the expense of your journalistic reputation, and eventually your core viewership declines.</p>

<p>It&#39;s kind of like diabetes, where if you eat enough shit over a long enough time, your cells will resist absorbing any more of it once you get too fat.  A fitting metaphor for the USA fake news epidemic maybe.</p>

<p>Imho it is a far worse source of information unless you are already pretty much informed and only seek confirmation from locals (etc.)</p>

<p>In effect social media only amplifies popular statements, hardens the social bubble and takes away the long editioral and all means of developing a balanced argument. Social media news is all headlines and no article. </p>

<p>Furthermore the attention span with social media news is greatly reduced, you simply consume headlines while you surf the web. If you sit down with the Guardian, the NYT, the NZZ or similar newspapers you are already forced to devote your attention to the newspaper/article and you will devote 5 or 10 or 30 minutes of your time reading the article. </p>

<p>And then you might get up and try to fact check the article. Or talk about the article. Or simply dismiss the argumentation in the article.</p>

<p>Social media has none of this. No one reads a 20 pg social media article. Why bother? And bit by bit you turn news which ought to provide a <em>narrative</em> (as in: a consistent explanation of why a event developed like it developed)  into a click-bait race for <em>truth</em> or <em>facts</em>.</p>

<p>and thats the reason which I&#39;m always pissed when someone proudly declares he &quot;red pilled&quot;, that I&#39;m a MSM fool and then maybe cites breitbart -.- </p>

<p>It&#39;s an unfortunate attitude that is pervasive through social media; just spouting off random shit in hopes that someone will be stupid enough to believe it and hit &quot;follow/like/upvote&quot;.</p>

<p>The worst part is in order to beat them, you have to play that insipid game yourself; one-upping them in hopes that people will see the light of fact over some fabricated lie that masquerades as a truth. To not play means the misinformation wins; by going unchallenged, it is an implicit endorsement of its accuracy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Their stories are perfectly real (well, most of them).  The problem is that their reporting is simply propaganda.</p>

<p>In America, &quot;propaganda&quot; is a bad word with bad connotations.  We don&#39;t like that word.  So, 90 years ago, Edward Bernays coined the term &quot;public relations.&quot;  It means the exact same thing, but it doesn&#39;t have all those negative authoritarian connotations.</p>

<p>&quot;Fake news&quot; is a code word for &quot;propaganda.&quot;  For 90 years, there has been only one voice of propaganda in this country, using Edward Bernays&#39; techniques to engineer our society.  In the last 5-10 years, other groups have begun using these same techniques.  Now, there is a &quot;conservative&quot; voice, disseminating propaganda of their own, which is how Trump got elected.</p>

<p>Propaganda.  CNN is propaganda.  Breitbart is propaganda.  They don&#39;t &quot;make up stories&quot; so much as make up worldviews, and tell you how to interpret events within the worldview they chose for you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think there’s a vast right wing conspiracy to oppress people of color. There always has been and always will.</p>

<p>I think Donald Trump ran for president because he wanted to line his pockets and there’s millions of brainwashed, alleged “marginalized” white people who are so deluded they actually think he’s going to help them by using the tried, tested and failed trickle down economics. </p>

<p>I think our government covers up the existence of aliens.</p>

<p>I think that someone stopped the electric car happening, most likely big auto and big government. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a difference between distrust and belief that everything someone reports is false. Distrust means you don&#39;t give them the benefit of the doubt and require them to prove that what they&#39;re reporting is true. It simply raises the standard of proof on them so that they can&#39;t just say &quot;x is true&quot; with no justification.</p>

<p>When the news lies and gets shit wrong as often as they do, they don&#39;t deserve this blanket trust people give them. It sounds like bizarre propaganda to insinuate that people should just stop questioning them and believe them without pause.</p>

<p>Course, that means none of this &quot;an anonymous source tells me vague thing I interpret as meaning this&quot; crap. The last few stories that required massive corrections due to the base information being entirely false, changing and reversing the entire story, were based entirely on anonymous sources. It&#39;s understandable why sources need to be kept secret, but news needs to get it through their thick skulls that anonymous does not mean credible. It&#39;s literally the opposite of credible.</p>

<p>What does this mean? If we disregard the source of information, how can we tell whether or not something is trustworthy or not? If we focus entirely on the message, how do we determine whether or not the message is true? Doesn&#39;t this open up people to believing only those things that they want to believe and ignore the rest of it regardless of truth?</p>

<p>This seems like the rationale of someone who believes things they read on 4chan and infowars. It allows people to give credence to state propaganda.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Truly think about what you&#39;re asking. If I completely ignore the source of information and instead view all sources effectively anonymously, I&#39;m unable to determine whether or not something should be considered reliable or not. It requires that I do all research into <strong>every subject I care to consider</strong> all by myself. &quot;Developing critical thinking abilities&quot; doesn&#39;t come close enough to do what you want me to do. There are entire fields which I am not qualified to investigate. I have not studied particle physics, microbiology, organic chemistry, political science, or any other of a thousand fields of study nearly enough to say that I understand them well enough to <strong>start</strong> to apply critical thinking skills.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s say we have two sources: one says &quot;Blargs have a quantum thurk of eleven ports&quot; while another anonymous source says &quot;Blargs have a quantum thurk of negative sixty ports&quot;. If we view them purely anonymously then, as someone who never studied Blargs, I can&#39;t even begin to apply critical thinking abilities to those two statements to decide which is true. But if I later find out that the first statement came from Dr. Blarg, world-renowned expert on Blargs while the other one came from a lobbyist who seeks to profit from anti-blarg propaganda, then suddenly the truth is easier to understand.</p>

<p>Sources are incredibly important because it&#39;s impossible for everyone to be experts on everything. </p>

<p>Are you gonna compare Obama to Trump? Every day Trump attacks the media and wants to revoke parts of the 1st amendment so he can sue them. Obama once attacked 1 network that had ran multiple hit pieces on his birth, wife, children and education.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are <em>you</em> going to compare Obama and Trump? Nobody in the history of life on this planet has seen an all out orchestrated assault on the character of a single individual as we&#39;ve witnessed with establishment media on Trump. Obama had Fox to deal with, <em>sometimes</em> harsher than he deserves, and literally every single other outlet was speculating whether he&#39;d float or sink if he attempted to go across Lake Michigan on foot. If you aren&#39;t aware of how much bullshit he pulled on the American public and the world at large, then that&#39;s probably why. </p>

<p>The ironic part about all this is it vastly increases many people&#39;s faith in the transparency of the administration, since people are actually holding him accountable. That they constantly have to write misleading or outright lying headlines only furthers this. Fucking petty retards shooting themselves in the foot, it&#39;s hilarious to watch on a daily basis.</p>

<p>Oh and PS, since we&#39;re on a conspiracy sub this is probably as good a time as any to mention that Obama did and does have a ton of shady history with all the topics you brought up. Why are his grades sealed? Why does nobody remember him in class? Why are there 0 pictures of Michelle pregnant? He was a CIA puppy trained from an early age and he duped a whole lot of people. Good.

<p>Lmao.  So the media doesn&#39;t need to be more careful about making sure they are reporting the truth?  They can just keep on posting false stories or sensationalize normal events and the good people of the united states will go back to having blind faith in the media if Trump would just quit supporting pedophiles in office.</p>

<p>All media outlets have an agenda and I for one am happy this whole fake news bullshit backfired right in their face and now people are questioning everything instead of just blindly following the mainstream narrative. It&#39;s good for people to observe a number of sources and form their own conclusions.</p>

You can read more about it here if you are interested in getting your head out of this false dichotomy paradigm you seem stuck in, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/09/russia-putin-revolutionizing-information-warfare/379880/">https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/09/russia-putin-revolutionizing-information-warfare/379880/</a>. BTW this was written in 2014, well before &quot;Russia Hacking, Fake News&quot; bullshit. By deeming everything your opponents say as Fake News, you ensure that your base only believes what you say and ignores everything else that doesn&#39;t fit into their own belief system, effectively creating a new false reality. This is not a tactic unique to Trump or Putin and has been used successfully throughout history. I made the generalization that you are Trump supporter because of the tone of your comment, and I honestly don&#39;t think I am wrong. It is rare for me to see non-Trump supporters complain about Trump needing to defend himself. So I have one question for you, do you believe the media has covered Roy Moore fairly, or do you believe he is just another target of Fake News? Because that is the lie Trump is feeding his supporter, despite very real comments made by Roy Moore himself that supports many of the media&#39;s claims.</p>

<p>Many Americans see through his lies and the media&#39;s lies. You can be critical of the media and critical of Trump, the two are not mutually exclusive. A fact that both you and Trump seem to be unable to grasp. Trump supporters have become so incredibly dogmatic in their approach that anything that is ever negative about their great leader is deemed false, without any critical thinking or analysis. I never once defended media organizations. If you actually read my first post I even acknowledged that a lot of them lie.... But it is a broad overgeneralization, that is not based in reality or fact to believe that every MSM article ever written is false. That is exactly what Trump wants you to believe, so that you will only believe him.... </p>

<p>You are right all media outlets have an agenda. Trump also has an agenda. Believing everything the president says is not &quot;Americans waking up,&quot; its them falling further and further into uncertainty, fear and delusion. I&#39;m done fighting with Trump supporters on a conspiracy sub, its getting so fucking old. This used to be a place where people saw through the false left-right divide, and recognized that both the media and politicians are simply tools to keep us fighting with each other. Now its just full of bullshit partisan politics.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump operates like a cult leader.  That&#39;s what all this constant bombardment of scandalous and outrageous statements is about.  It&#39;s called intelligence dampening.  It fucks up your short term memory and leaves you emotionally overwhelmed, and when you&#39;re emotionally overwhelmed you are very vulnerable to suggestion.  That&#39;s also what his constant repetition of leading statements is about.  He breaks people down bit by bit and presents himself as a savior after he&#39;s left them feeling helpless without him. </p>

<p>The way he operates I have little doubt that Trump either studied brainwashing techniques or came about them naturally as an extreme narcissist.    </p>

<p>-Some literally fake Macedonian websites posted literal fake news</p>

<p>-Media made a big deal out of it and acted like Trump won because of it</p>

<p>-Media outlets proceed to distribute lists of FakeNews sites the citizens must avoid, with the definition of &quot;fake&quot; broadened to include Breitbart</p>

<p>-Trump turns it around and turns the word into a meme</p>

<p>It has 2 benefits because it made the msm&#39;s &quot;watch out for that scary FAKE NEWS&quot; thing blow up in their face, and it&#39;s a perfect vessel for him to rail on the lying press.  And yes we really do have a lying press problem.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a good thing that these people have written all media off as &quot;fake news&quot;. If you familiarize yourself with different forms of news and understand that most people have an agenda to push, it&#39;s important to use critical thinking to wade through the shit and get to the base of reports. I prefer to research journalists to see who has the better track record because I think that lends more credibility. I don&#39;t really see how the president only supporting media that paints him positively is a good thing and it seems like there&#39;s an ulterior motive to make his supporters automatically write off any evidence of wrongdoing. He&#39;s been conditioning his voters to do this since before he was elected. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ironically, &#39;fake news&#39; was a term initially used by the MSM to discredit WL and alternative news sources which were not aligned to their narrative during the 2016 election. Take the WaPos listing of alternative news sites with Russian influence which included non-establishment left and right sites. The article seemed reactionary with a case of desperation and little vetting of the source and motives. </p>

<p>After the election, Trump used the MSM platforms against themselves like he did during the election to takeover the control the meaning of &#39;fake news&#39;.</p>

<p>MSM outlets have done their part in earning the fake news label. Trump is no beacon of truth, but I can&#39;t fault anyone for turning away from traditional news outlets, particularly the front pages and op eds. Trump has turned the &#39;fake news&#39; label into a rally cry for his base. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well most are in meme form on FB.  But they’re on both sides of politics.  </p>

<p>One from the left shared on my FB timeline this week was that Trump said if he were to run he would run as a Republican because they’re the dumbest voters.  Just google “Trump Republicans dumb” and you’ll see it cited as fake news.  One of the more popular ones that just wont die.</p>

<p>One from my right leaning family would be that Starbucks withheld coffee from Marines stating that Starbucks didn’t support the war or anyone serving in it.</p>

<p>Both shared this week, it’s honestly from the older generation.  So if you don’t have older family on your social media, congrats, you don’t have to debunk the BS day after day </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem is that decrying <em>all</em> MSM as &quot;fake news&quot; leads a person to other outlets, mainly Russian propaganda (RT) or fringe &quot;news&quot; sites with lunatic theories on why science is evil, vaccinations are bad and why this President/Pope/whatever will be the last one before a major apocalyptic event.</p>

<p>It&#39;s fine to be discerning, just don&#39;t tar all MSM with the sae brush because claiming them as misinformation and fake news and then turning to sites that are actual misinformation and fake news is just as dangerous as blindly listening to what someone like Fox News says.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem is that Trump doesn&#39;t use the term &quot;fake news&quot; <em>only</em> when describing poorly researched, misleadingly framed, or downright inaccurate stories.</p>

<p>He also uses it ad nauseam to describe <em>real</em> stories (and documentable facts) that are critical of him.</p>

<p>&quot;Fake news&quot; would be a far more powerful weapon if Trump reserved it only for stories like the CNN/Wikileaks email, and if he deployed it deftly and eloquently (difficult to imagine, right?). </p>

<p>Instead, he sprays it all over the walls, covering 50%+ of everything in the news cycle with the term.</p>

<p>So, for every story like this--where he&#39;s encouraging critical thinking--there are three where he&#39;s saying &quot;you can pick your own facts and choose your own reality!&quot; Which is the <em>opposite</em> of encouraging critical thinking.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Or the MSM is garbage regardless of what Trump says ? It shouldn&#39;t take Trump calling them fake news before you had that revelation. I would argue that you probably shouldn&#39;t trust the government either, even if they do support Trump. Coming to these conclusions yourself is  much better.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That simply sounds like attention seeking, to be honest; they did no real work. They just found something they hadn&#39;t heard about yet, assumed no one else had and decided to become ever so briefly the center of attention.</p>

<p>&quot;LOOK! I found this!&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s an unfortunate attitude that is pervasive through social media; just spouting off random shit in hopes that someone will be stupid enough to believe it and hit &quot;follow/like/upvote&quot;.</p>

<p>The worst part is in order to beat them, you have to play that insipid game yourself; one-upping them in hopes that people will see the light of fact over some fabricated lie that masquerades as a truth. To not play means the misinformation wins; by going unchallenged, it is an implicit endorsement of its accuracy.</p>
