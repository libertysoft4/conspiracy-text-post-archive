        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I, for one, think that we should be alerted when a thread is X-posted. I argued this for over a year and was told that totesmessengerbot was disabled because it could leave the sub open to accusations of brigading. </p>

<p>We had a fairly organic experiment with this- after the Las Vegas event, totesmessengerbot was enabled. Only recently it was banned again. I didn&#39;t see or hear of any brigading that resulted from this sub during the months that the bot was enabled. Has anyone else?</p>

<p>Anyway, I feel that it is important that folks know who is &quot;participating&quot; in the conversation. I&#39;d be willing to go back to (as our lurkers call it,) my &quot;hall monitor activity&quot; of alerting a thread in the comments when it has been X-posted, but I would prefer we let the bot do the work.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like TotesMessengerBot.  I think it is good to know what posts r/TopMindsOfReddit x-post right in the thread.  It also gives other community created subs exposure.</p>

<p>The whole argument that it opens our sub up to accusations of brigading is really silly to me considering what TMOR gets away with.  I have not seen a single r/conspiracy brigade and have experienced TMOR brigades on multiple occasions on r/conspiracy where posts/comments of regulars are down voted to like -40.</p>

<p>I feel the only downside is that TMOR causes people to feel bad.  People can decide whether they read the TMOR threads.</p>

<p>That said, I wonder why TotesMessengerBot is currently banned.</p>

<p>Every totesmsgr I saw from TMoR I went over and scorched earthed them.  That lasted a few weeks til they banned me.</p>

<p>I&#39;m OK with that. I think it&#39;s important to see how people outside of the community interpret what is said. Obviously TMOR is going to be more critical than an unbiased observer, but I still think it&#39;s valuable.</p>
