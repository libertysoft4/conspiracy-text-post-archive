        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Before, I never thought anything of it. I thought it was a ridiculous theory. Sure, maybe Bush let the planes fly into the buildings, but pulling the trigger on 3000 lives, sealing their fate? </p>

<p>I never really gave it much thought, because how could it be? I thought we were supposed to unite together as Americans and fight the bad guys. But how could the bad guys be Americans? Its just something your mind can&#39;t wrap around. And I think the same is so for most other Americans. How could someone do that? </p>

<p>So let&#39;s clarify: the owner of WTC7 asked for permission from the insurance company to pull the trigger? </p>

<p>Is that the motive for this theory? Is it the same motive among all 3 buildings? Was one motive hiding evidence? Was it to fulfill the plan of taking out WTC so it had to be done no matter what? Did they want to destroy certain offices for certain purposes located in the buildings? </p>

<p>Please help me understand better. Now that so much time has passed, I think people can start waking up to the truth that has uncovered itself. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good question...here&#39;s your answer from God Almighty himself.</p>

<p>Revelation 13:9-10 (KJV)</p>

<p>9 If any man have an ear, let him hear.</p>

<p>10 He that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity: he that killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword. Here is the patience and the faith of the saints.</p>

<p>If you can accept that Almighty God is a Black man and that the white man is responsible for all the water, air and crop pollution...promoting homosexuality, LGBTP(p is for pedi now!) and basically fucking up the earth....stealing all native people&#39;s land and natural recources to benefit themselves....then there might be a place for you....</p>

<p>Isaiah 14 1-2  (KJV)</p>

<p>For the Lord will have mercy on Jacob, and will yet choose Israel, and set them in their own land: and the strangers shall be joined with them, and they shall cleave to the house of Jacob.</p>

<p>2 And the people shall take them, and bring them to their place: and the house of Israel shall possess them in the land of the Lord for servants and handmaids: and they shall take them captives, whose captives they were; and they shall rule over their oppressors.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No problem</p>

<p>Are Jews &#39;white&#39;? 
Hell no. Jew is short for the Tribe of Judah. The Prophet Jeremiah describes what the ancient Jews looked like...</p>

<p>Jeremiah 14:2</p>

<p>Judah mourneth, and the gates thereof languish; they are black</p>

<p>King Solomon was also from the tribe of Judah. Here he describes himself in the Song Of Solomon...</p>

<p>Song Of Solomon 1-5 KJV</p>

<p>I am black, but comely, O ye daughters of Jerusalem</p>

<p>How about Koreans? Not the ones you see on TV. All the lands of China, Korea and Japan were once inhabited by Negritos (look it up) though....they are also remnants of the lost sheep of Israel!</p>

<p>Dark Indians? The Original ones forced way down south...Siddis or untouchables...yes. </p>

<p>How could someone assist in their every day lives? Let them know who they truly are...Most of them have know idea of their true nationality. They need to repent (come back to) and pray to their God!</p>

<p>Are there any public examples of white people doing the right thing? No. Everything you know and think is false.</p>

<p>Job 9:24 KJV</p>

<p>24 The earth is given into the hand of the wicked</p>

<p>All your world leaders worship Satan(if you don&#39;t know yet, you will soon)....So saith the Lord God Almighty Power Of Israel!</p>

<p>A hollow plane which flies at (greater than) top speed into one single solid massive steel support column, if you imagine one standing freely in an open field, will be torn asunder and horrifically sliced lengthwise like a cooked carrot.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A couple of issues:</p>

<p>&quot;Top speed&quot; as you call it is not the maximum speed achievable, but the maximum speed an aircraft can <em>safely</em> fly - that is, before stresses induced in the structure risk causing failure.</p>

<p>If the pilot is going to crash the plane anyway, he&#39;s not concerned about whether the speed might cause structural failure.</p>

<p>Next is Newton&#39;s Third Law. &#39;For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction&#39;.  The same amount of energy that was used to tear apart the structure of the aircraft was also dumped into the structure of the support columns. Neither of them could withstand that amount of energy without failing.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why both the aircraft <em>and</em> the columns were destroyed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And that they did this without even slowing down on the way in.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bullshit. Low qualilty video footage of the impacts is not a good source for the measurement of sudden changes in velocity over extremely short periods of time.</p>

<p>500 miles per hour is equal to 739.2 feet per second. Filmed at 30 frames per second, an aircraft travelling 500 mph would travel 24.64 feet every frame.</p>

<p>Each WTC tower was 207 feet 2 inches wide. That means that an aircraft travelling at 500 mph would take about 8 frames of 30 fps video to travel the full distance through a WTC tower. That&#39;s less than 1/3 of a second.</p>

<p>In reality, the aircraft decelerated from 500 mph to 0 mph in less than a second.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s totally physically impossible.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, you just don&#39;t understand physics.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you are shown something so absolutely physically impossible as this on television, it cannot be real.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What we were shown was completely possible. Your problem is, you&#39;re ignorant enough to fool yourself into thinking you have knowledge.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are rebuttals worth responding to, and then there are ones like this. Newton&#39;s 3rd Law is precisely why we know the footage was fake.

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>both of which scenarios would destroy the plane and leave the building intact.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nope. That&#39;s the problem with people like you. You think you know what you&#39;re talking about, but you don&#39;t.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t matter which is moving and which is stationary - the result is the same either way. The result, however, is not what you imagine. There are real physical effects that can be calculated. For example, a 757 hitting a building at 500 mph would hit with the same force per square inch as a point blank shot from a .50 caliber rifle. These are the bullets that can punch through an engine block.</p>

<p>The frontal area of the fuselage of a 757 is 17,210 square inches. Imagine 17,000 .50 caliber bullets hitting the side of a building at the same time, all within a circle 148 inches in diameter, and then you&#39;ll start to appreciate the sheer force involved in this sort of impact.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>If you fire that beer can at a high enough velocity, it will crumple until it can&#39;t be crushed any more.... and punch a neat little hole all the way through the tree.</p>

<p>The fact is, the force of the impact was far greater than the steel columns were designed to withstand, by several orders of magnitude. The aircraft cut through them like a hot knife through butter... but were utterly disintegrated in the process.</p>

<p>You seem to think that 120,000 pounds of aluminium would simply vapourise into a cloud of harmless smoke, but even if the entire aircraft turned into liquid at the moment of impact, it would still be 120,000 pounds of liquid hitting the side of the WTC at 500 mph.</p>

<p>If you think that would have no affect on the building, you&#39;re a total idiot.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just to clarify, the &quot;Israeli art students&quot; theory is fallacious and based on false information. The art students were not even Israelis but European, Austrians if I remember correctly. Also the boxes that are supposed to for &quot;fuse holders&quot; could have been a number of different items, and the fuse holders which are points out by the theorists according to electricians who have weighed in, are not sufficient for those kind of explosives. </p>

<p>The the two most important agencies in carrying out 9/11 were the CIA and the Saudi Intelligence Agency. The head of the Saudi Intelligence Agency - Prince Turki, resigned just 10 days before 9/11. The Saudi involvement has been acknowledged in the mainstream media, and yet Turki Al Faisal remains a free man. Turki Al Faisal was actually trained in America by Jesuit priests at the Georgetown University Edmond A. Walsh School of Foreign Service, which is rated as the number one foreign service school in the world. Many Kings and heads of Sate have been trained there. And guess who else was trained at Georgetown? The Director of the CIA at the time - George Tenet. </p>

And nevertheless, the Mossad during 9/11 took orders from the CIA which was admitted by the head of the Mossad during 9/11; the same head of the Mossad who was awarded the CIA Directors award for his service to American-led global intelligence efforts.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>When we say jet fuel doesn’t burn hot enough to melt steel, that means it doesn’t burn hot enough in <strong>open air</strong> to melt steel. Throw in the furnace effect and the temperatures climb drastically. </p></li>
<li><p>That metal could have been molten aluminum. He metal seen pouring out of the impact hole was molten aluminum from the airplane. Aluminum’s melting point is only 1200° F. </p></li>

<p>Also the fact that the building fell in the manner it did.</p>

<p>The 4 or 5 floors affected by the impact and the fire gave way, and the weight of the 30 or so floors above them caused the structure to give way. The top section of the building above the impact floors weighed many thousands of tons. That much weight falling on the rest of the building is what destroyed it. </p>

<p>You’re saying they used nukes? Then where’s the fallout? Why would they use nukes? Why would they be underground? Nothing we saw shows evidence of anything happening underground. Remember, the WTC is technically built past the Manhattan shoreline. Where it was built is artificially extended shore line.

<p>I’m not watching an hour video. You can give me bullet points or a time to skip to. But explain how there’s no nuclear fallout form this nuclear explosion? Why is no radiation observed? Why did no one experience any symptoms associated with heavy radiation exposure? Why did the base of both towers appear completely stationary as the top fell on them? There is no evidence of a massive blast underneath the buildings. How does this explosion bring down one building and not the other? Keeping in mind that they are technically not on the actual Manhattan island but an artificial extension into the Hudson River. Dimitri Khalezov is not a scientist. He allegedly worked for the USSR in a department that detected nuclear tests in other countries. This is a charlatan who wants attention. </p>

<p>“NIST responded that there was no &quot;clear chain of custody&quot; to prove that the four samples of dust came from the WTC site”</p>

<p>How would they even have access to those samples or know exactly there they come from if they weren’t connected to an official investigation in any way? Again when the research is coming from  “Architects &amp; Engineers for 9/11 Truth” and “International Center for 9/11 Studies” that screams confirmation bias. Seeing as how nobody else in the world has come to a similar conclusion, they’re probably lying. </p>

<p>There’s nothing difficult about pointing a plane at something. I’m a pilot. I’ve taken people flying all the time, and with no experience, I can’t talk them through everything but takeoff and landing. Anyone who thinks it’s “nearly impossible” to fly into the pentagon knows nothing about aviation. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Pilot interview with Kevin Barrett about impossible maneuvers (51:56):</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well it’s a 51:55 video soooo... but you’re in luck because it doesn’t matter. I also happened to be a Navy fighter pilot and I can promise you that there’s nothing implausible about flying into the pentagon. If you give me a more specific time stamp, then I can see what this dude thinks is so important, but he’s probably just an idiot. I’d tell him that to his face. </p>

<p>Well they didn’t pull 6 Gs so he just made they up. They did a descending turn until they were low enough to nose over. Once again, up/down/left/right isn’t hard with basic flight training. They don’t care about being smooth, or complying with any rules, or worrying about breaking anything. This video is nothing more than a random pilot getting attention for his own opinion. I’m a fighter pilot and I say he’s flat out wrong. You can take that to the bank. </p>

<p>&quot;Hey guys, I&#39;m a pilot and it&#39;s totally legit that that smear you saw in the pentagon surveillance video is the great ace, Hani Hanjour flying his jet into the building and killing a bunch of inconvenient auditors.&quot;</p>

<p>Why would I believe that? Between building 7 and the pentagon, they exposed their scam. At this point to act like &quot;There&#39;s nothing to see here&quot; is just gaslighting.   </p>

<p>More abou Hani &quot;Red Barron of the Middle East&quot; Hanjour
:</p>

<p>Staff members characterized Mr. Hanjour as polite, meek and very quiet. But most of all, the former employee said, they considered him a very bad pilot.</p>

<p>&#39;&#39;I&#39;m still to this day amazed that he could have flown into the Pentagon,&#39;&#39; the former employee said. &#39;&#39;He could not fly at all.&quot;</p>

<p>That’s literally what thev’re said multiple times. This “level of difficulty” is why you’re crying conspiracy. That’s the whole reason you keep people’s opinion of his flying skills. </p>

<p>How about you go buy a flight sim and a joystick and go try it yourself? I can tell you over and over that it’s not hard but once you see for yourself, you’ll get it. </p>

<p>Again, I’m a Navy fighter pilot so this appeal to authority means nothing to me. If I ever met him, I’d tell him to his face that I think he’s a piece of shit attention whore. </p>

<p>“But the ex-employee said Mr. Hanjour continued to pay to train on a simulator for Boeing 737 jets”</p>

<p>So he had plenty of practice in a high-fidelity jet simulator. You know they do check rides in this things right? </p>

<p>How many times in how many different ways do I have to say this. It doesn’t matter that he was a shit pilot. Pointing and airplane at something and flying into it is not a difficult task. </p>

<p>Buuuuuut. Since you don’t answer questions you don’t have answers to, how about a different question? What exactly are you implying with your assertion? He was a bad pilot, therefore flight 77 did not fly into the pentagon? How are his shitty flying skills evidenced of a conspiracy?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>No. Having a question about something does not automatically equal a conspiracy. That’s not logical. But say there was a conspiracy, why would they lie but say bumbling idiot was the pilot? Why wouldn’t they pick a better pilot since they have control of the scenario?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Not to mention his uncanny ability to hit the side with the auditors.</p>

<p>The pentagon is a very important building. You could make that arguement no matter where it got hit. How do you know he hit an office that was auditing something. What were they auditing? How do conspiracy theorists with no connection to the government know what was going on in there? If some master shadow empire directed the attack, why would they need to fly a plane into the pentagon to stop an audit? How do they not just have the power to stop an audit? What’s being audited that’s so bad, being secretly responsible for 9/11 is better and less risky? You see that’s the biggest problem I have with you people. You consider yourselves such inquisitive thinkers but 10 seconds of thought and your theories just don’t make any sense.</p>

<p>They just want attention. I read Ralph kolstad’s website. Every point he gives has been long since debunked. He’s also over-inflating his navy career. He couldn’t have flown active duty for more than 10 years and still fly 27 years in the airlines. But he doesn’t want you to know that. He makes no mention of being a navy reservist for half of his 20 years. He is intentionally misleading and therefore untrustworthy. </p>

<p>That article doesn’t mention anything about an audit. Do you only have the ability to read more than one sentence? Why would a shadow government fly a plane into a building when they could just stop the audit? </p>

<blockquote>

<p>There were plane phones. And once the plane was low enough, cell phones we’re within range of cell towers. Have you never started getting text messages 10 minutes prior to landing? I do that all the time. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>buildings collapsed because &quot;the fire was just too intense&quot;, </p>

<p>The fire <strong>weakened</strong> (not melted) the steel support structure enough for it to collapse under tens of thousands thousand tons of building above it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Kl0tHx36RRQ">Aviation fuel in open air can definitely do that</a>. Go in deeper and add the furnace effect and it gets even worse. </p>

I just don&#39;t get hung up in a battle of wits for <em>absolutes</em> - a fast moving, explosive projectile hit both #1 &amp; #2 and yet...nothing hit the entire rest of the Plaza and #7 Poof!

<p>Again, I&#39;ve no way to prove the death-toll within the structures so I choose not to speculate. Lest we forget, there are First Responders, Citizens and Volunteers afflicted with terrible Cancers from exposure to air quality at Ground Zero - Thanks Christine Todd-Whitman ya cunt!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Whether or not there were any planes that day seems like a rather important thing to be clear about. Same goes for the death toll. If 3,000 people actually died then we are talking about something very different to a made-for-TV movie, which is what many of us suspect 9/11 to have been.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can speculate and theorize all night long but I cannot prove the specific aspects of anything around 9/11.</p>

<p>Go look and research long and hard into the foot print of the entire Plaza. What exactly do you see? Research what happened to Deutch Bank. Why the hell did that building rust apart from the inside out?
How about the cars and buses that burnt but not the trees? A car was found teetering on a wooden fence! Tiny bone fragments scattered across any number of buildings - wtf blew these people to shreds? How about the Fireman that didn&#39;t fit in his uniform, clear down to his boots because he was more like Jelly and some bones? </p>

<p>I&#39;ve been at this for awhile and I suspect very few people see things the same as I do.</p>

<p>Go to 2:30 - 2:46  and really analyze the shit out of this clip - when you think you&#39;ve spotted the high strangeness let me know...here&#39;s a hint you&#39;re not looking at the sky in any of this:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The best theory, I think, is that to secure Silverstein&#39;s cooperation the planners had to guarantee that 7 was destroyed as well as every other part of the WTC complex. Silverstein had owned 7 for decades already, and wanted to replace it, but the cost of the demolition and asbestos abatement would have been in the billion dollar range. The planners knew all this, so they made him an offer: buy the lease on the rest of the WTC complex, help us gain access to the building interiors, and in exchange we&#39;ll demolish the whole complex, 7 included, so you can reap the insurance payout and rebuild the entire thing to your liking. </p>

<p>I think that WTC1 and 7 were supposed to go down simultaneously upon the impact of the first plane as though the plane knocked the North Tower down, and falling debris &quot;took out&quot; WTC7. And WTC2 was similarly supposed to drop upon the impact of the second plane. I believe that the fact that the Twin Towers burned unimpressively for a hour or so before the demolition, and the fact that 7 was so obviously imploded hours later while millions watched were the result of colossal fuckups on the part of the planners. There was never supposed to be cameras trained on the buildings from every angle, nor surviving witnesses from within the buildings. The whole event was supposed to have taken place in just a few minutes on either side of 9 am that morning. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look into WHEN the Owner of the towers purchased insurance policies against “acts of terrorism”, how much money and down time IT WAS GOING TO COST HIM to remove all of the asbestos throughout both towers(which were on the list of buildings to be condemned due to asbestos levels), and then how much money he instead MADE that day due to the towers collapsing. That would be a good start.</p>

<p>Then you could look at what happened to the steel beams that were removed from the site after the collapse. Steel structures had NEVER failed like this before. EVER. If a natural failure, this anomaly screamed for further analysis, even from the perspective of public and Government agencies who’s job it is to make sure that a collapse like this never happens again. Why was the steel so quickly removed, shipped out of the country and sold as scrap? Why did the WTC site smolder for another 4 months?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No one is saying you couldn&#39;t fly into the pentagon, they are saying the official story is a lie.  The guy interviewing with Kevin Barnett is a former navy pilot. Not a random pilot.</p>

<p>&quot;Hey guys, I&#39;m a pilot and it&#39;s totally legit that that smear you saw in the pentagon surveillance video is the great ace, Hani Hanjour flying his jet into the building and killing a bunch of inconvenient auditors.&quot;</p>

<p>Why would I believe that? Between building 7 and the pentagon, they exposed their scam. At this point to act like &quot;There&#39;s nothing to see here&quot; is just gaslighting.   </p>

<p>More abou Hani &quot;Red Barron of the Middle East&quot; Hanjour
:</p>

<p>Staff members characterized Mr. Hanjour as polite, meek and very quiet. But most of all, the former employee said, they considered him a very bad pilot.</p>

<p>&#39;&#39;I&#39;m still to this day amazed that he could have flown into the Pentagon,&#39;&#39; the former employee said. &#39;&#39;He could not fly at all.&quot;</p>

<p><em>Why would we *want</em> opium flowing? Who benefits from this? How does this group of people who supposedly benefits from this convince thousands of people betray their country and take part in his enourmous conspiracy?</p>

<ul>
<li><p>On the Harley guy. Why would they hire this plant? Why wouldn’t they just let the events speak for themselves? That’s just uselessly adding people to the conspiracy.</p></li>
<li><p>If their goal was to cover up illegal activity, then why wouldn they just hide where money went and simply not talk about it? Thats way easier than the most complex and involved covert operation in the history of mankind.</p></li>
