        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>OK,  so - Mel Gibson - fascist nutter, correct? Totally discredited by the Hollywood Press Machine as an abuser and a pr*ck?</p>

<p>Maybe not. </p>

<p>Maybe Gibson is another actor, who has picked up a reputation for being &quot;difficult&quot;, because he refuses to sleep with various directors/producers/money men?</p>

<p>I have no way of verifying the following - yes, he was in London, and was on the Graham Norton show. Who Gibson made these alleged comments to, according to the article - in the Green Room, after filming the Graham Noron Show - is unknown. </p>

<p>If the whole story is invented - I have looked, but UK Google censorship laws keep interfering. I would kinda love someone to demonstrate this story is b*llocks, in fact.</p>

<p>Anyway, assuming this <em>is</em> Mel Gibson speaking, here&#39;s what he said:</p>

<p>Quote:</p>

<p>&quot;I don’t know how to break it to you gently… Hollywood is institutionalized pedophilia.</p>

<p>“They are using and abusing kids.“</p>

<p>“They churn through a huge amount of kids every year. Their spiritual beliefs, if you can call them that, direct them to harvest the energy of the kids. They feast on this stuff and they thrive on it,” the Hacksaw Ridge director said.</p>

<p>“What do I mean? This isn’t some kind of artistic abstraction. They harvest the blood of children. They eat their flesh. They believe this gives them life force. If the child was suffering in body and psyche before it died, they believe this gives them extra life force.”</p>

<p>“There is a creative and loving force inside most of us that guides us through life. These people don’t have this. For them it’s the opposite.”</p>

<p>According to Mel Gibson, who has spent 30 years in and out of the Hollywood system, the industry elites “thrive on pain, trauma, stress, abuse, and suffering.”</p>

<p>“Hollywood is drenched in the blood of innocent children. For a long time all the references to pedophilia and cannibalism were symbolic or allusive. But I was personally introduced to the practice in the early 2000s. I can talk about this now because these people, the execs, they’re dead now.”</p>

<p>“The blood of a sexually abused infant is considered highly ‘enriched’ and is highly prized. The money changing hands, the favors, the kickbacks – you have no idea. Babies are a high-functioning currency all of their own. Babies are their premium brand of high-grade caviar cocaine diamond steak.” &quot;</p>

<p>Whatever happened, it&#39;s also extreme interesting that this also happened in the same week as his alleged comments above - his &#39;come-back&#39; movie release has been halted, supppsedly because Gibson was denied final cut...</p>

<p><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4908302/Mel-Gibson-sues-stop-release-comeback-film.html">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4908302/Mel-Gibson-sues-stop-release-comeback-film.html</a></p>

<p>Funny how both articles mention his &quot;passion project that he&#39;s been working on for 20 years&quot;, given how many days in advance the &quot;blood parasite&quot; story was published of the &quot;Gibson and director sued&quot; story in The Daily Mail...</p>

<p>Given that basically all actors, and sports stars, and musicians, etc etc, behave badly - maybe it&#39;s time to re-examine Gibson&#39;s original arrest?</p>

<p>Just a thought.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I clearly stated the source in my OP, and I also clearly asked for anyone to prove it was bollocks. </p>

<p>Do you have that proof? Have I missed something, and &quot;Newswire&quot; is a spoof/fake news site? </p>

<p>Please do let me know if it is - as I said, EU google restrictions make everything harder over here, now that they can scrub reports from the interwebs, it&#39;s much harder to find the source documents for stuff...</p>

<p>As I said, I hoped it was nonsense (despite fitting in well with previous CSA accounts - in fact, it was <em>because</em> it fitted in so well with CSA accounts, that I flagged it as potentially suspicious...)</p>

<p>Is this personal bias, like I encountered when sharing the list from the Ron Paul forum (despite it having f*ck all to do with Ron Paul himself, the info is just posted there, I have encountered a similar response when copying that link...?)</p>

<p>(Here&#39;s that link, btw)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah. Thank you. I was searching for &quot;newswire&quot; rather than &quot;your newswire&quot; - hence, no spoof warning. </p>

<p>What is alleged in the spoof article really doesn&#39;t appear to be that far from the truth, however...</p>

<p>Anyway, cheers 👍 </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bret Easton Ellis (you probably know him best for American Psycho) grew up a LA kid, and wrote his first novel, Less Than Zero, about the high school landscape of LA. 20 years later he was back in LA getting a bit involved with the film industry, and wrote a sequel to the book about what happened to these kids as they become adults. That book is Imperial Bedrooms.</p>

<p>You can read just Imperial Bedrooms if you like, though I recommend all of his work, and both Less Than Zero and Imperial Bedrooms are ~200 pages minimalist fun.</p>

<p>When you&#39;re done with that you can check out Glamorama. Which is about Male Models committing terrorist acts (yes, Zoolander ripped them off, and yes, BEE won money in a court settlement.) Glamorama is much darker and much more intelligent than Zoolander. It&#39;s the sibling to American Psycho. While American Psycho was about NY 1980s Club Scene and connection to Wall Street. Glamorama was about NY 1990s Club Scene and connection to larger finances ... International Terrorism Finances.</p>

<p>All his books are great. He has an unflinching view towards the excesses to Hollywood.</p>

<p>At first glance you might expect him to be a Bryan Singer type. Instead he&#39;s the type that Bryan Singer thinks to invite to his parties, and then BEE writes about and exposes Singer.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m a huge fan of BEE, and yeah, saw some stuff about his expose of Singer&#39;s party scene and how he never got invited back. Didn&#39;t know about Imperial Bedrooms, though, or Glamorama, so thanks very much for those recommendations, I will check them out. Got sucked into looking up Geffen and Chester Bennington...that blind on CDAN has really set the internet ablaze, seems like... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, they definitely have some info on CDAN, but there was a bit of a LARP on one of their parts. Enty posts something about Bennington and his post stops short .... they&#39;re acting like someone blocked him and he half posted .... in the comments himmmmm is saying he paid out of pocket to get the DDOS stopped.</p>

<p>So himmmmm identified himself to some computer people to fix things. He trusts them enough to reveal his identity like that, but they don&#39;t trust him enough to just stop the DDOS and bill him later?</p>

<p>As someone who knows something about computers, it was a bit cheesy for me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, Enty&#39;s identity is known (the recent Vanity Fair profile), and Himmmm is supposed to be 4 guys, so...maybe? I know nothing about computers, I do know they throw in &#39;red herrings&#39; for whatever reason, so maybe the paying out of pocket thing is a diversion? (I realise that&#39;s a bit of a stretch lol, but they&#39;ve been right about so much, and rumours have swirled around Geffen for years, he was a founder investor in DEN, after all..) </p>

<p>Also - I heard Enty was Chunk from The Goonies? That would fit the 300lb bit, certainly...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes indeed he does. There was a real outcry on twitter about him being booked <em>at all</em> for The Graham Norton Show, largely because of that recording you linked. I never meant to imply I thought he was innocent at all, far from it, just that these folks with &#39;attitudes&#39; who are &#39;difficult&#39; keep turning out to be people who may have experienced abuse. Anyhow, my source was bogus lol</p>
