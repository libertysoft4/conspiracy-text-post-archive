        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I just have some questions pertaining to different theory/conspiracy subject matter. I&#39;m just wanting to see what other people think, I&#39;m not trying to argue or make of point of who&#39;s right or wrong. Now, moving on!</p>

<p>Round earth vs flat earth? </p>

<p>I believe what I can verify for myself and I really can&#39;t say what the shape of the earth is. However I would like to know one simple question. If the earth really is round then why don&#39;t astronauts ever show a full 360 degree view showing that persepective?</p>

<p>9/11 planes as cause of tower collapse vs bombs</p>

<p>I like many fellow American have watched that horrible video numerous times trying to figure it out and each time I come away with more questions than answers and I&#39;ve heard both sides. My question would be is the narrative projected by the MSM the real truth or is something more sinister the cause?</p>

<p>Best one for last....</p>

<p>Alien abductions for real or are people just making things up?</p>

<p>So this one is interesting to me because it&#39;s been reported for a very long time and still to this day. I believe Alien life is real but at the same time I&#39;d need to see one in person to become a real believer. Are people really being abducted or are people just making things up for attention?</p>

<p>I&#39;m not looking for super long drawn out answers I just want to see what other peoples&#39; opinions are. And also, if you care to elobarote on what the benefit would be for each said subject that&#39;s opposite of the accepted idea from MSM that&#39;d be cool too.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure what you mean, but I&#39;ve literally flown from DC direct to Tokyo over the top. Every pilot, and a few million other people from related professions would have be in on it, always, since the beginning and continuing to current day. There&#39;s too much math, science and proven dependent science to consider otherwise.</p>

<p>The two towers were hit by airplanes. I know people who saw it first hand. The Pentagon was hit by a plane. I worked on PENREN in wedge 2 and watched it smoking from my office. Building 7 had cut beams and was blown up with explosives.</p>

<p>There are probably aliens. We probably haven&#39;t met them as they probably would just kill us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Crazy speeds only seem crazy when you forget the crazy distances involved.</p>

<p>As a simple example, no one alive has seen Pluto complete an orbit around the sun, as it takes about 248 years for Pluto to complete one orbit.</p>

<p>The next big jump in distance is the Sun&#39;s orbit around the center of the Milky Way galaxy. It takes more than 225 <em>million</em> years for the Sun to complete one orbit around the galaxy.</p>

<p>If you had a lifespan of a few hundred million years, your perception of the movement of the stars would be very different.</p>

<p>There are a range of other options, ranging from &quot;people really believe they have been abducted by aliens, but are suffering delusions&quot; to &quot;people really are being abducted, but not by aliens&quot;.</p>

<p>If aliens <em>are</em> involved, another way of thinking about it is &quot;aliens are sampling a native species, much like our scientists would sample a species of animals.</p>
