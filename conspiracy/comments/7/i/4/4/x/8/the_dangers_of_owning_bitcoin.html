<p>Heads up on this.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The risk with Bitcoin is that the government could simply change the definition of money. That is what they did to me back in 1980 because I was one of the three main market-makers in gold (perhaps the biggest). It was all a hunt for taxes, not concerning me but my clients. I have explained before why I retired from making markets in gold — the IRS declared me to be a BANK!
Now comes Bitcoin. The Judiciary Committee of the United States Senate is currently working on Bill S.1241 that aims to criminalize deliberate concealment of property or the control of a financial account. The bill was submitted in June, and the law would change the definition of “financial account” and “financial institution,” and thus also cover digital currencies and digital exchanges. Who is pushing it? None other than California’s Senator Dianne Feinstein, who maintains that the bill is needed to update existing money laundering laws because of terrorists.
This means that the miners of Bitcoin will become a “bank,” as I was declared. The operators of the trading platform Coinbase were forced by court ruling to notify the IRS of the identity of over 14,000 investors who were trading $20,000 in Bitcoin. Users were affected if their trading volume had exceeded $20,000 at the beginning of 2013 by the end of 2015. So this is NOT a single transaction, but accumulative. The IRS will now “presume” tax evasion. This is what I warned would happen. Been there done that! They can shut down Bitcoin in the blink of an eye by simply defining anyone who is a miner to be a financial institution.
The bill will change the definition of “financial institution” in Section 53412 (a) of Title 31 , United States Code.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK go get rid of your biometrics. Chop your face off. Listen I&#39;ve been screaming about this for 8 years.. pre bitcoin.  You are wrong and if you actually cared you&#39;d serve yourself much better by spending time looking into HOW it will be done. Stop assuming Jack Van Impe was a tech expert in the 80s. Why the hell would the use a physical chip? What&#39;s the advantage? There&#39;s a million logistical and technical reasons why a chip is the most stupid way to implement the beast system. You think the devil is going to do something that makes zero sense just so Christians can get fair warning? Because that&#39;s what they expect? Chips are useless. Pointless. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn’t think about it that way, certainly makes sense. As if they didn’t already have enough excuses or “reasons” to tax the people to death, as well as the possibility of what you described being used to go after a political opponent, or foe by citing use of
Bitcoin as a reason to suspect illegal activity. With the prevalence of BC being used in early SilkRoad &amp; other darknet black market markets, I can see that also being used when it’s convenient by law enforcement as probable cause. I hope I’m wrong but the slippery slope of the time we live in seems to be getting even more slippery. Seems after 9/11 and the Patriot Act, designating a person or entity the government might not like/want gone a terrorist provides carte blanch to do whatever and a blank check to pay for it. </p>

<p>Exactly. BTC can get easily exchanged to any currency that <em>didn&#39;t</em> fall apart, and retain it&#39;s value. Then you can be one of the only people to afford the $10,000~$15,000 plane ticket to get the fuck out of the area to somewhere safer. </p>

<p>this sub in a nutshell</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A fiat currency</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not even a little bit. No one is giving Bitcoin value by decree-- people are giving it value because it&#39;s network is based on math, instead of sketchy suits at the FED. It&#39;s a pretty appealing alternative imo.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Now you can pay capital gains tax</p>

<p>&quot;Now&quot; being the big word here-- once crypto-currencies crash the global fractional reserve system, there won&#39;t be anyone to pay taxes to. this scenario could go a few ways though, obviously.</p>

<p>Otherwise right on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s the only problem. Current financial institutions still control ins and outs of FIAT currency. So if were to find an exchange that you would trust and that is not coinbase (even though coinbase is super convenient), you&#39;d get your money through. I&#39;ve personally triend cex.io, got my money through. But they are kinda major as well, so I&#39;m not sure your bank wouldn&#39;t cancel the transaction. Also they appear to be owned by the same guys owning bitfinex and tether usd, so do it carefully. Once you get your bitcoin or whatever other currency, peace out asap. Never hold money on exchanges. </p>

<p>Alternatively, you could use an intermediary that wouldn&#39;t be immediately linked to the cryptocurrency. I&#39;m Russian and I&#39;ve used advcash.com to depost funds from the card there and then use the funds to get USD (not USDT, big difference) on wex.nz (former btc-e). They have their own comission, but in total it shouldn&#39;t be much more than that of coinbase (comission is in the exchange rate already) or cex.io (they have around 7% from card transactions, last time I checked). So I&#39;d advise reading about intermediary payment platforms to transact, if your banks deny direct purchases of cryptocurrencies. Benefits of that are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>You have to ID yourself to them, and they are less likely to be hacked, because they are usually much smaller and hence less interesting for hackers.</li>
<li>You don&#39;t transact with crypto exchanges directly, hence you maintain plausible deniability as to <strong>why</strong> the funds go to this payment site, should your government make it illegal to buy bitcoin. They would have to subpoena the site where you transaction went to have something on you, which would take them time and chances are they probably won&#39;t bother, unless you send like millions of dollars through. </li>
<li>You have a way to legitimately spend money from those intermediaries on digital goods (and non-digital too), so they are not stuck there completely, should something happen. They are not directly tied to crypto, so might not be an initial target. </li>
</ul>

<p>Drawbacks:</p>

<ul>
<li>They are small, risk of security breach is still high. Some might not be trustworthy, so do your due diligence and don&#39;t send big sums straight away. Check the path to an exchange with like 10 bucks first. make sure everything works before buying something. </li>
<li>These intermediaries have transaction limits, usually a few thousand dollars at once, so if you were planning to invest more, will have to spread out the transactions. </li>
</ul>

<p>That&#39;s about it. So yeah, spend some time to find the combination of means that suits you, check it diligently, and once you buy crypto, withdraw it to an external wallet 100% under your control. Never hold money on an exchange. advcash.com + wex.nz (or exmo.com) both work, I&#39;ve tried them personally. However, just because they&#39;ve worked for me <strong>so far</strong> doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;ll keep working forever. So be smart about it, make sure your money don&#39;t sit anywhere where you don&#39;t have control over for too long. Should you need any other advice, feel free to shoot</p>

And he spake a parable unto them, saying, The ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully: and he thought within himself, saying, What shall I do, because I have no room where to bestow my fruits? And he said, This will I do: I will pull down my barns, and build greater; and there will I bestow all my fruits and my goods. And I will say to my soul, Soul, thou hast much goods laid up for many years; take thine ease, eat, drink, and be merry. But God said unto him, Thou fool, this night thy soul shall be required of thee: then whose shall those things be, which thou hast provided?

    <div class="md"><p>And who runs the power grid? Public Utilities aka the government. You can hear Uncle Sam chuckling in the background.</p>

<p>Or what about something like Hurricane Irma coming along and leaving 10 million without power. Good luck buying some bananas or a plane ticket outta there.</p>

<p>Even one EMP mishap or solar flare will devalue bitcoin pretty hard. They can already cut power to your home remotely at the flip of a switch, be late on your bill and they&#39;ll kindly remind you of the literal <em>power</em> they behold.</p>

<p>I have a unique view of bitcoin. It&#39;s a token of the time it took electricity to do work. So it&#39;s a currency tied directly to this kind of technological society we&#39;re living in and idolizing.</p>

<p>When a company goes rogue and installs bitcoin mining Javascript into their website and you visit that website, they are actually using your CPU time and the electricity you pay for to do the mining <em>for themselves</em>. They are stealing your electricity. Bitcoin is a token of that electrical work or output. They just stole from you and the end representation of that theft is a &quot;bitcoin&quot; you can&#39;t get back. The electricity is already spent.</p>

<p>And you know where electricity comes from...coal, oil, etc. We are not escaping the Petrodollar that easily until we have 100% renewable energy.</p>

<p>Kind of a weird perspective I know, haven&#39;t fleshed it out too much yet.</p>

Seems like a good thing to piggyback &#39;free app&#39;. Remind me of SETI outsourced calculations, although I wonder if they&#39;re still doing that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s the only problem. Current financial institutions still control ins and outs of FIAT currency. So if were to find an exchange that you would trust and that is not coinbase (even though coinbase is super convenient), you&#39;d get your money through. I&#39;ve personally triend cex.io, got my money through. But they are kinda major as well, so I&#39;m not sure your bank wouldn&#39;t cancel the transaction. Also they appear to be owned by the same guys owning bitfinex and tether usd, so do it carefully. Once you get your bitcoin or whatever other currency, peace out asap. Never hold money on exchanges. </p>

<p>Alternatively, you could use an intermediary that wouldn&#39;t be immediately linked to the cryptocurrency. I&#39;m Russian and I&#39;ve used advcash.com to depost funds from the card there and then use the funds to get USD (not USDT, big difference) on wex.nz (former btc-e). They have their own comission, but in total it shouldn&#39;t be much more than that of coinbase (comission is in the exchange rate already) or cex.io (they have around 7% from card transactions, last time I checked). So I&#39;d advise reading about intermediary payment platforms to transact, if your banks deny direct purchases of cryptocurrencies. Benefits of that are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>You have to ID yourself to them, and they are less likely to be hacked, because they are usually much smaller and hence less interesting for hackers.</li>
<li>You don&#39;t transact with crypto exchanges directly, hence you maintain plausible deniability as to <strong>why</strong> the funds go to this payment site, should your government make it illegal to buy bitcoin. They would have to subpoena the site where you transaction went to have something on you, which would take them time and chances are they probably won&#39;t bother, unless you send like millions of dollars through. </li>
<li>You have a way to legitimately spend money from those intermediaries on digital goods (and non-digital too), so they are not stuck there completely, should something happen. They are not directly tied to crypto, so might not be an initial target. </li>
</ul>

<p>Drawbacks:</p>

<ul>
<li>They are small, risk of security breach is still high. Some might not be trustworthy, so do your due diligence and don&#39;t send big sums straight away. Check the path to an exchange with like 10 bucks first. make sure everything works before buying something. </li>
<li>These intermediaries have transaction limits, usually a few thousand dollars at once, so if you were planning to invest more, will have to spread out the transactions. </li>
</ul>

<p>That&#39;s about it. So yeah, spend some time to find the combination of means that suits you, check it diligently, and once you buy crypto, withdraw it to an external wallet 100% under your control. Never hold money on an exchange. advcash.com + wex.nz (or exmo.com) both work, I&#39;ve tried them personally. However, just because they&#39;ve worked for me <strong>so far</strong> doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;ll keep working forever. So be smart about it, make sure your money don&#39;t sit anywhere where you don&#39;t have control over for too long. Should you need any other advice, feel free to shoot</p>
