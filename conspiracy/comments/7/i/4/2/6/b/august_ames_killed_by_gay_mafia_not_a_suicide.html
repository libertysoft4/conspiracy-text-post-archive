<p>If you didn&#39;t know already, porn industry is run by many jews in hollywood. They are all apart of the gay mafia. There are many directors that are gay and in the closet such as Bryan Singer, Spielberg, Geffen, Katzenberg and etc. </p>

<p>Pornstar August Ames was speaking out against the gays and would not do a shoot with one of them because many carry std&#39;s. This angered the gay mafia and they took her out. Media will spin this as a &quot;suicide&quot; as they are paid to do. The gay mafia is extremely powerful and I encourage you guys to do more research and leave it in the comments.</p>

<p>EDIT: Many of you are believing it&#39;s drugs/depression/online bullying. While those can cause one to commit suicide, this girl did not exhibit those signs. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>A woman who wants to die would not value and care for her body. She refused to work with a gay actor to protect herself from their disgusting diseases. Read her tweets where she says she does her homework on actors for her body.</p></li>
<li><p>The online bullying did not phase her and lead her to depression. She defended herself and fought back and even told the SJW&#39;s to go fuck themselves. She did not feel defeated and depressed by the pressure. Refer to her tweets.</p></li>
<li><p>Death by hanging/asphyxia is a common way to kill someone without leaving a trail of evidence to murder to place the blame on suicide.</p></li>
<li><p>There was a tweet from her about exposing the system. They were placing gay guys with straight women without their knowledge or consent. Agents were not being transparent and she called them out.</p></li>
<li><p>Gay mafia has a history of taking people out who do not play by their rules and expose their system. Do your research.</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>I think this would probably have more to do with STD&#39;s than a &quot;gay mafia&quot;. The porn industry is supposed to have their folks tested on a regular basis. The last time SHTF the porn industry almost had a meltdown.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/hiv-scare-in-porn-industry-after-2-actors-test-positive/">https://www.cbsnews.com/news/hiv-scare-in-porn-industry-after-2-actors-test-positive/</a></p>

<p>I bet it&#39;s more likely that these companies aren&#39;t paying for the required testing and there&#39;s some folks out there spreading disease. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah her &quot;suicide&quot; sounds suspicious as fuck.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Whichever (lady) performer is replacing me tomorrow for @EroticaXNews, you&#39;re shooting with a guy who has shot gay porn, just to let cha know. BS is all I can say. Do agents really not care about who they&#39;re representing? #ladirect I do my homework for my body,&quot; she wrote Dec. 3.</p>

<p>Shortly after posting the tweet, Ames was forced to defend herself against a flood of online harassers.
&quot;NOT homophobic. Most girls don&#39;t shoot with guys who have shot gay porn, for safety. That&#39;s just how it is with me. I&#39;m not putting my body at risk, I don&#39;t know what they do in their private lives,&quot; she wrote.
A day later, on Dec. 4, she expressed frustration with the criticism.
&quot;Don&#39;t do anything that makes you uncomfortable&quot;
&quot;Share your thoughts.&quot;
Hmm. Well, I did all three, and twitter took a dump on me,&quot; she wrote.</p>

<p>She defended herself again after a user responded to the tweet urging her to apologize.
&quot;F--k you guys for attacking me when none of my intentions were malicious. I f--king love the gay community! What the f--k ever! I CHOOSE who I have inside my body. No hate,&quot; she wrote.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Does not sound suicidal AT ALL, she&#39;s defending herself against online SJW hordes (she&#39;d actually just get banned off Twitter if this went any further), she&#39;s a hot as fuck model with loads of cash, looks amazing and healthy, and she kills herself because of ONLINE BULLYING from a bunch of SJWs?! Complete bullshit and the depression excuse is bullshit too, virtually EVERYONE experiences bouts of depression, and her recent tweets and ig posts shows her her normal, exuberant pornstar self. You do NOT throw away your life like this.</p>

<p>The only real angle is drug overdose, but apparently she fucking HUNG HERSELF?!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ibtimes.com/what-august-ames-cause-death-adult-actress-dead-23-2624929">http://www.ibtimes.com/what-august-ames-cause-death-adult-actress-dead-23-2624929</a></p>

<p>Update Wednesday, 8:52 p.m. EST: The Ventura County, Ca. Health Care Agency confirmed Grabowski&#39;s death Wednesday evening. &quot;Mercedes Grabowski died of asphyxia due to hanging. Manner is suicide,&quot; the agency&#39;s public information officer told International Business Times.</p>

<p>Online bullying was able to trigger her into hanging herself - fucking really? You&#39;ve gotta tell us about the gay mafia but this 100% stinks to high heaven.</p>

<p>you don&#39;t have a PHD in depression, a normal human feeling, and therefore cannot comment on depression</p>

<p>yes I have no idea what depression is, I didn&#39;t realize it was so strong and that it hits you so instantly that you would give up your life, go buy a noose, and hang yourself, because you got triggered by the twitter SJW community and not all the times when you were harrassed by literally everyone else for being a porn star. i&#39;m reeeally sure she gives a fuck about what others think - especially when it comes to her own life decisions.</p>

<p>but yeah thanks for contributing literally nothing and only attacking me, seriously congratulations, you should be proud.</p>

<p>wtf is the gay mafia</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The rootless, unified LGBT &quot;agenda&quot; that doesn&#39;t have kids, is biologically incapable of having kids, and has a huge chip on its shoulder from being berated by &quot;traditional&quot; society. Empowered by modern society and elevated to the point where they can do very little wrong by virtue of being a low rung on the ladder (theoretically), they actively enforce the modern &quot;progressive&quot; world, which is deeply at odds with not just our personal tradition of the past, but every other culture in the world&#39;s today that has managed to retain even the slightest semblance of independence from the ideological cancer that is the US media apparatus. </p>

<p>Whenever something bad happens in the world, there&#39;s usually a certain kind of people pulling the strings, and a certain kind of people using the power of shame and idle nepotism to ensure that on &quot;the right side of history&quot; there is no true diversity, ethnically, culturally, or ideologically. It&#39;s a lot easier to sell your country out for a theoretical tomorrow that&#39;s not set in stone yet when you&#39;re physically incapable of leaving a genetic legacy behind and it&#39;s not YOUR kids you&#39;re stealing from to make it happen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alright, choose who you want to have sex with that&#39;s great. Where is the proof that homosexual have a higher chance of sti&#39;s. Straight men can do gay porn as well. Anyone in the porn industry has a higher chance of an sti because, guess what, they have a career where they have sex with lots of different people.</p>

<p>If her assumption is that because he&#39;s gay he must have an sti, that would make the person a bigot. Also, thinking  that there is a group of homosexuals that kill people for refusing to do work with them is farfetched.</p>
