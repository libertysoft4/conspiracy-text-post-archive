        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This is a complex topic but I&#39;ll try to keep it as short as possible; thus it will sound like nonsense to people unfamiliar with the background (but I don&#39;t care, I&#39;d recommend you research the topic if you&#39;re genuinely interested). </p>

<p>Shemitah in a nutshell: the Kabbalistic calendar is divided in periods of 7 years. Every 7*7 years is a &quot;Shemitah year&quot;, followed (on the 50th year) by a &quot;Jubilee year&quot;. TLDR something &quot;historic&quot; is made to happen exactly every 50 years in Israel. Indeed these people are superstitious freaks and want their deeds to align with their astrotheological and mystical belief system. </p>

<p>So 1917 was the Balfour declaration, 1967 the &quot;liberation&quot; of Jerusalem and 2017 the &quot;recognition&quot; of Jerusalem. Similarly the world zionist congress was founded exactly 50 years before the UN adopted the partition plan for Palestine.</p>

<p>Whether you believe this last event to be historic or not doesn&#39;t matter; it is being presented as such by every last statesman, whether <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/netanyahu-likens-trumps-jerusalem-speech-to-israels-founding/">in praise</a> or <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/hezbollah-leader-trump-move-a-second-balfour-declaration/">criticizing</a> the move.</p>

<p>Note this is not a &quot;Jewish&quot; thing per say; the central planners / secret societies all agree on viewing Jerusalem as the world&#39;s future capital city, whether they identify as &quot;Jews&quot;, &quot;Knights Templar&quot;, &quot;Rosicrucians&quot;, &quot;Masons&quot;, &quot;Zionists&quot; or whatever else. </p>

<p>You see according to hermeticists the Christian &quot;West&quot;, symbolized by the cross (i.e. the sun) represents the &quot;male principle&quot;, or the left column (Boaz) of Solomon&#39;s temple. Conversely the Islamic &quot;East&quot;, symbolized by the moon, represents the &quot;female principle&quot;, or the right column (Jachin). The center/middle, Christ-child (Horus/Tammuz), or the perfect (&quot;holy&quot;) combination of the male and female principles is represented by &quot;Judaism&quot; - actually an usurped name, we are talking here about the astrotheological/mystical mystery religion/cult/school symbolized nowadays by the seal of Solomon (i.e. a hexagon, symbol of Saturn, itself symbol of &quot;planets and stars&quot;, the third hermetic/astronomical realm after the sun and moon).</p>

<p>The news we&#39;ve been seeing, <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/9-out-of-11-former-us-envoys-oppose-trump-jerusalem-declaration/">things like</a> &quot;9 out of 11 US envoys oppose Trump&#39;s Jerusalem declaration&quot; tend to confirm this hermetic interpretation (if you don&#39;t know the significance of these numbers please ignore this point, it is not the crux of my demonstration).</p>

<p>If this view is correct, this latest move, in order to fully become historic, must spark a new war, which itself must somehow upset the status-quo in the near east. My guess is regional powers will be &quot;dragged into&quot; it (i.e. Iran, Saudi Arabia and Israel). The mystics in power liken the &quot;third Temple&quot; as the beginning of the &quot;new golden age of man&quot; (i.e. NWO), so its construction is likely to be a planned conclusion of this upcoming &quot;turmoil&quot;. </p>

<p>I speculate all this will lead to a new &quot;peace initiative&quot; whereby Palestinians are given a mock state, Jerusalem becomes an &quot;international city&quot;, and the &quot;third temple&quot; is eventually <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90XSXEfeIjI">built over Gihon spring</a>.</p>

<p>Time will tell.</p>

<p>TLDR: don&#39;t underestimate the symbolic and mystical meaning of yesterday&#39;s announcement. </p>

<p>It indeed  sounds like nonsense to me.</p>

<p>A Shemitah Year (year of relinquishing) In Judaism happens every 7th year, and is the agricultural practice of not working the land every 7th year to let it recover (the jubilee happens every 7 Shmitot). The last such year was 2014-2015 (Jewish years start ~late September), making your 1917-1967-2017 timeline completely disconnected from the Shemitah cycle (not to mention the fact that June 1967 and December 2017 are actually 51 Jewish years apart, not 50).</p>

<p>In the kabbalah, as far as I can tell, there are cosmic cycles which last 7,000 years, the seventh such cycle is &quot;Shemitah&quot;, and is where the cosmos &quot;resets and restores balance&quot;. This is all supposedly part of a larger 50,000 year long, larger cycle. So, admitting my lack of any further knowledge on this subject specifically, I&#39;m not sure how these cycles relate to your post. But kabbalah is a nice-sounding word.</p>

<p>Your hermeticist (am I using the term correctly?) parallels were interesting (and I&#39;ll admit my fascination with levantine/mesopotamian/egyptian polytheism), but they stray quite a bit from Jewish perceptions of the temple. If these are the people you claim (with quotation marks or otherwise) would attempt to rebuild such a temple, I don&#39;t think they will act as you designated. Also, and most glaringly, why would a third temple be built anywhere but temple mount?? That&#39;s where the &quot;holy of hollies&quot; of Judaism lies (i.e the Dvir, the &quot;Rock&quot; in &quot;Dome of the Rock&quot;). Building it on the Gihon spring (where an old fort nicknamed the &quot;City of David&quot; stands) would be rather meaningless. </p>

<p>My main concern is that this view, while interesting, will be taken to represent the Jewish/Israeli view of the announcement. There are several factual inaccuracies in it (in the Jewish POV), and no mainstream (or even messianic) branch of Judaism (that I know of) holds it.</p>

<p>The &quot;wailing wall&quot; is the Western wall of Herod&#39;s Antonia fortress; it has nothing to do with the Solomon temple. Solomon temple was never on the hill now called Haram esh-Sharif; it was right below, over Gihon springs.</p>

<p>Archeologists and Zionists alike are slowly revealing this fact; I recommend you watch the documentary I <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90XSXEfeIjI">linked</a> about this, if you&#39;re interested. Whether based in historic truth or not, this seems a great path to go ahead and build a &quot;third&quot; temple without destroying Al Aqsa.</p>

<p>Your use of this epithet I (humbly) think shows a lack of visibility on this topic.</p>

<p>About the Shemitah, I&#39;m basing my remarks mostly on Jonathan Cahn&#39;s work (and others who have expanded on his own analysis). I&#39;m not nearly erudite enough on Jewish mysticism to contradict what you&#39;re saying. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I took the time to watch this video. It certainly was interesting, but I disagree with your approach of seeing it as the &quot;slowly-revealed fact&quot;. It&#39;s an interpretation that runs counter to the mainstream archaeological interpretation (see the works of Leen Ritmeyer, Benjamin Mazar et. al.). At this point in time, I cannot say which one is better supported by evidence. Also, I found their reliance on Nehemiah to claim the reconstruction of Solomon&#39;s Temple (by order of Cyrus the Great, circa 580 BCE) was over the Gihon spring to be rather flimsy (perhaps some English translation supports their views better). </p>

<p>Without having the time to delve deeper into this topic, I&#39;ll say it&#39;s an interesting theory that deserves more research (on my behalf). In any case, I don&#39;t think anyone in their right mind is planning on leveling the noble sanctuary any time soon (nor building the third temple, for that matter), regardless of proclamations by the US president. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I appreciate the time you took to watch the documentary, I truly respect your  intellectual honesty. I definitely agree with you that it runs counter to the mainstream archaeological interpretation. The wailing wall has been venerated for at least 1000 years, I must admit it would be a pretty hard consensus to overturn.</p>

<p>I advance this theory because I find it the only way to reconcile the occult central planners&#39; intent on building a temple, and the obvious impracticality of destroying the dome.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve never heard of the &quot;shield of Solomon&quot;. Since you put that word in italics it means you meant to correct me. Do you care to enlighten me further?</p>

<p>Also this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The hexagram or &quot;Star of David&quot;, which became a symbol of Judaism in the modern period and was placed on the flag of Israel in 1948, has its origins in 14th-century depictions of the Seal of Solomon. In 1354, King of Bohemia Charles IV prescribed for the Jews of Prague a red flag with both David&#39;s shield and Solomon&#39;s seal, while the red flag with which the Jews met King Matthias of Hungary in the 15th century showed two pentagrams with two golden stars.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In Hebrew the name for the pentagram is &quot;Magen Shlomo&quot; which means &quot;Shield of Solomon&quot; and the hexagram is a &quot;Magen Dovid&quot;. For some reason, medieval Christian esotericists interpreted &quot;magen&quot; incorrectly as &quot;seal&quot;. In modern English, Jews refer to the &quot;Magen Dovid&quot; as &quot;The Star of David&quot;. So in Judaism, they are not referred to at all as &quot;seal&quot; hence the correction in italics. </p>

<p>So I&#39;m not sure what that has to do with your incorrect Shmitta information, nor your claim that it only came into use in the late 1800s. </p>

<p>Just googled the guy. He <em>correctly</em> identifies the last Shmitta year as <a href="http://www.daystar.com/news-updates/general-updates/beyond-the-shemitah-with-rabbi-jonathan-cahn/">2015-2016</a>. Mind you, these dates are according to the Gregorian Calendar, not the Jewish Calendar. No one keeps track of the Jubilee Years anymore, so there are some contradicting opinions as to when it happens. There is one opinion that states that year 5777 is a Jubilee, but as it&#39;s currently 5778 that does away with your comment about the Jerusalem announcement. </p>

<p>The Wiki article you linked to also mentions that it has much <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_of_David#Early_use_as_an_ornament">earlier depictions</a>. Still not sure where you concept of it being invented in the 1800s comes from. Especially considering its use in this <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f2/The_Hebrew_Clock_On_The_Old_Jewish_Town_Hall%2C_Prague..jpg">18th century building</a>. Sure it became more popular after the Zionists adopted it for their flag, but it was hardly a new symbol.</p>

It will tell all people how to end wars and solve mankind&#39;s problems, and everyone will worship it.

    <div class="md"><p>Be careful with this interpretation.  It comes from people like Nickleson1968 who are subtle deceivers.  I believe this will happen but the real Antichrist will defeat this &quot;straw man&quot; Antichrist to make himself seem like Jesus Christ.  He will take a head blow that appears to kill him, lose his eye then he will appear to be resurrected 3 days later.  He then will defeat the false Antichrist and call himself God.</p>

<p>That&#39;s one theory.  The key is the actual Antichrist is going to defeat some kind of false Antichrist.  It&#39;s the Dark side/Light side Luciferian dualism.</p>

<p>He will not have a right eye at some point.  This is where all the &quot;one eye&quot; Luciferin symbolism comes from.  Guts from Berzerk  (he has the arm wound as well), Oden (marvel depicts it), The kid from Walking dead, Kubo and the Two Strings, it goes on and on, too many to list.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Omar Abdel Rahman?  Wrong eye for one but we just aren&#39;t in that point of the timeline yet.  Jesus Christ let&#39;s the Antichrist out of the pit when he pops the first seal.  He will have supernatural power and lying wonders.</p>

<p>Rev 6:1  And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seals, and I heard, as it were the noise of thunder, one of the four beasts saying, Come and see. </p>

<p>Rev 6:2  And I saw, and behold a white horse: and he that sat on him had a bow; and a crown was given unto him: and he went forth conquering, and to conquer. </p>

<p>He will be riding a white horse just like Jesus and he will have a crown.  He will look a lot like Jesus, my bet is he will look a lot like all the Catholic long hair Jesus pictures.  I think many are going to confuse him for Jesus, especially if they aren&#39;t studying their KJV.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He&#39;s part of a loose network of YouTube guys that are building a network that will be the next level &quot;truthers&quot; since Alex Jones and his level of Gatekeeping has activated and dumped his followers back into the world of politics.  You will notice they all like and comment on each other&#39;s videos.  They are all subscribed to each other.  FaceLikeTheSun, Nickleson, ODD, DITRH, RichieFromBoston etc.  There are a ton of these guys and they are basically Gnostics.  They push texts like Enoch and use very close to Hollywood level effects, music, and symbolism.  The ones that profess Christianity all try to make people think we are already in the &quot;end times&quot; which is a key part of the deception going on right now.  Satan wants people to believe we are already there so that when the actual Antichrist shows up he can defeat whoever is propped up as the Darth Vader type for him to take down.</p>

<p>They focus much more on the darkness than the light of the truth which is the KJV Bible:</p>

<p>Eph 5:11  And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them.</p>

<p>Eph 5:12  For it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret. </p>

<p>I think it&#39;s ok to watch them if you are strong in understating the word of God and can discern the truth from the lies but for people that are unsaved they are very dangerous as they can clean to an &quot;awake&quot; feeling but they never preach the true Gospel so these people will just be distracted until Jacob&#39;s trouble hits and then I think these types will start to move their flocks toward accepting the Antichrist.  Baby saved Christians can also just get distracted by them and never grow.  It will prevent them from being used by God.  Hopefully the Holy Spirit will turned them away from them as he did for me.  It&#39;s easy to get lost in that kind of stuff.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry, that&#39;s not true. Muslims don&#39;t believe that. Imam Mahdi has very specific descriptions - He will be a descendant of prophet Muhammad and people will give allegiance to him at the Kabah. He will NOT claim to be God. </p>

<p>Secondly, the anti-christ in Islam (AKA Dajjal) has a physical description. He will be short but well built. He will be blind in the right eye and his left eye will be kind of filmy looking. The anti-Christ will claim he&#39;s God and that&#39;s how Muslims will know he&#39;s the dajjal. The word &quot;kafir&quot; (Disbeliever) will be written on his forehead and only believers will see that.  He will enter every town and village on Earth except Mecca and Medina because they&#39;ll be guarded by two angels. Eventually, the dajjal will be killed by Jesus Christ (a prophet in Islam) when he descends back to Earth. The Dajjal will also be childless. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>To be honest that is even worse.  It fits almost exactly with what is going to actually happen but the entire time, even as Jesus is returning in the clouds on his white horse the Muslims will not believe his saving Gospel because they don&#39;t understand that it is perfectly within God&#39;s power to come to earth as a man and walk among us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the response. You are correct in saying that Muslims don&#39;t believe Jesus is the Son of God or God. But a prophet born of the Virgin Mary who was sent to the children of Israel to renew the message of pure monotheism after they had gone astray. He was given the power to perform miracles as had other prophets before him.</p>

<p>I guess we&#39;ll just have to wait and see what happens. Peace.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You clearly are incapable of having a civilized discussion. I was just pointing out the differences. Although I disagree with your beliefs, I never denigrated Christians. Fun fact - Muslims believe in the original Gospels as they were revealed to Jesus. But we believe they have been altered by man over time and the original message of pure monotheism has been lost. I also didn&#39;t mention the whole Council of Nicea where the divinity of Jesus was debated on 300 years after Jesus. </p>

<p>I never understood why people say Muslims worship the moon. Where does that come from? You clearly haven&#39;t read the Qur&#39;an.</p>

<p>&quot;And of His portents are the night and the day and the sun and the moon. Do not prostrate to the sun or the moon; but prostrate to God Who created them, if it is in truth Him Whom ye worship.&quot;
Quran 41:47</p>

<p>apologies, I&#39;ve never had to quote someone before and not sure how to do it -- but I wanted to make people aware that a 2-dimensional hexagon is a 3-dimensional cube.</p>

<p>Why is this important?</p>

<p>Because the black cube is the symbol of Saturn worshipers. Yes Saturn does mean Satan and yes that means occult.</p>

<p>Now, why would these people use a black cube?</p>

<p>I&#39;m a firm believer that you must uncover the truth yourself and not be told it -- to uncover this truth type &quot;Saturn North Pole&quot; into any search engine.</p>

Then the religious would contemplate whether or not a 5th temple would make sense. OR even better, they would become atheists because they finally see how stupid biblical prophesies are. </p>
