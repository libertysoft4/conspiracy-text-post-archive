Imagine just trying to search for simple information but not being able to because these greedy pieces of shit sold you for money. I mean, if this shit goes down no more simply asking questions on the internet. It&#39;s truly disgusting what our government is doing to it&#39;s people. This is how it starts. Knowledge is power. But people in power want to stay in that position. Keep the masses stupid and brainwashed. If you don&#39;t think for yourself someone else will think for you. My dad always used to tell me that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Totally. There&#39;s many other different reasons with $$$ being the main one. But money IS power, we all know that. So if you don&#39;t have money how do you fight back? Knowledge. Being a step ahead of them, knowing your individual rights and how to apply them. People could say to me &quot;there&#39;s still libraries tho&quot; and yeah, no shit. But what the library doesn&#39;t provide is unbiased and anonymous information. That&#39;s the beauty of Reddit. I mean there was that time where there was a shooting going on in a school, I believe. And people inside the school were posting things on reddit. Info that NO news source had simply because they were not there. It&#39;s a different hearing an account from a news source rather than a witness. Like war stories. I used to have a history teacher that was in WW2 and let me tell you, half the shit he saw was not in our history books. That&#39;s priceless knowledge. </p>

<p>But the corporate greed is dependent on being able to shut down other sources of information... You can only charge a content provider extra, if you promise to give them access that the other content providers can&#39;t get.</p>

<p>Fortunately, we no longer have to rely on what they allow us. Even if they took away Youtube, Twitter, FB and any other major social media site, we would still find ways to affiliate with each other and share information, even if we had to go back to the old BBS days. If everything goes to hell, I&#39;ll personally dedicate a $200 used laptop w Linux thrown on it, to run a fake reddit and irc, so we always will have a place to bitch about flat earthers and bigfoot.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s all smoke and mirrors, and the masses are being tricked. Here is a comment I made in another thread about &quot;net neutrality&quot;:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They are all working together for it. Controlled opposition. Facebook and Google wont have to pay more, and Comcast and the others will continue to not have to compete with new startups trying to lower the prices. Everything is a rich man&#39;s trick, and you all are playing right into their hands.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It amazes me, how so many people (even here) are falling for it. If we really wanted to address things, to make the internet more open and free, then we would address the regulations already on the books (and get rid of them). You know, like how Comcast can get local politicians to give them a near monopoly in a city.</p>

<p>The double think people have on this topic, is mind blowing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here is an example to make it more clear:</p>

<p>Someone using TimeWarner Cable sets up a web server and hosts a website on it. We&#39;ll call that &quot;Site A&quot;. Someone else using AT&amp;T sets up a web server and hosts a competing website on it. We&#39;ll call it &quot;Site B&quot;. Both sites provide the same service - let&#39;s say web-based messaging.</p>

<p>A third person using Verizon Wireless wants to use a web based messaging service, such as the one provided by &quot;Site A&quot; or &quot;Site B&quot;.</p>

<p>With net neutrality, Verizon Wireless has to give their user access to either site at the same speed. All hosts are considered equal. The Verizon user can choose to use &quot;Site A&quot;, knowing he&#39;ll get the same level of connectivity as with &quot;Site B&quot;.</p>

<p>Without net neutrality, Verizon Wireless can do a deal with AT&amp;T to give their customers&#39; sites preference over TimeWarner Cable. This could mean the Verizon user gets much slower connection speeds to &quot;Site A&quot; than to &quot;Site B&quot;. It could even mean he is blocked from accessing &quot;Site A&quot; at all.</p>

<p>This of course gives &quot;Site B&quot; an advantage, but only if &quot;Site B&quot; remains on AT&amp;T. So not only has AT&amp;T got a captive customer, but the owner of &quot;Site A&quot; now has a strong reason to change to AT&amp;T. This harms TimeWarner Cable, because their connections become less desirable for hosting servers. This could potentially put TimeWarner Cable out of business.</p>

<p>So &quot;Site A&quot; moves to AT&amp;T, and now &quot;Site A&quot; and &quot;Site B&quot; are competing on a level playing field again. So the owner of &quot;Site B&quot; does a direct deal with Verizon - no matter what network &quot;Site B&quot; uses to connect, &quot;Site B&quot; will always get preferential treatment over &quot;Site A&quot;.</p>

<p>As can be plainly seen, this harms not only the end user - whose choices become more and more limited - but harms the owner of &quot;Site A&quot;. This smaller service can&#39;t afford to pay Verizon for preferential treatment, and thus is relegated to 2nd Class status on Verizon&#39;s network, all but guaranteeing he&#39;ll fail.</p>

<p>The upshot of all this is that without net neutrality, the bigger ISPs will be able to put the smaller ones out of business by negotiating preferential treatment with other ISPs. Likewise bigger content providers will be able to put smaller ones out of business by negotiating preferential treatment with the bigger ISPs.</p>

<p>There will be fewer and fewer ISPs and fewer are fewer content providers, until only the biggest corporations remain. You will have less and less options until you become a passive consumer of the content the big corporations want to give you.</p>

Many are worried they may have to pay more for Netflix. I don’t care about Netflix. I want it to be open, and to allow free-speech. I never saw many problems with it until this Title II of the Comm.

<p>This rise in censorship... did it come from the FCC, or the corporations the FCC is trying to give full control to?</p>

<p>Did YouTube demonitise channels because it was ordered to do so by the FCC, or to please its corporate advertisers?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I never saw many problems with it until this Title II of the Comm. Act passed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The internet didn&#39;t even exist when Title II of the Communications Act was passed. That was passed in 1934.</p>

<p>What you&#39;re referring to is the application of Title II to Internet Service Providers.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A widely cited example of a violation of net neutrality principles was the Internet service provider Comcast&#39;s secret slowing (&quot;throttling&quot;) of uploads from peer-to-peer file sharing (P2P) applications by using forged packets.[6] Comcast did not stop blocking these protocols, like BitTorrent, until the FCC ordered them to stop.[7] In another minor example, The Madison River Communications company was fined US$15,000 by the FCC, in 2004, for restricting their customers&#39; access to Vonage, which was rivaling their own services.[8] AT&amp;T was also caught limiting access to FaceTime, so only those users who paid for AT&amp;T&#39;s new shared data plans could access the application.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The funny thing is, that report touches on the exact reasons why people want net neutrality. If AT&amp;T is allowed to treat their own services differently, then competition will suffer. I have no idea how they&#39;ve tricked you into believing that net neutrality stifles competition. We didn&#39;t have it before and have been stuck with essentially no choices when it comes to internet providers. Getting rid of it now won&#39;t magically cause mom and pop ISPs to crop up. It&#39;ll just give current ISPs free reign to throttle competing services. It can only hurt competition. </p>

It will just go back to the way it was before 2015 if the chairman passes it. Honestly, my internet bill has not gone down since then. However, I have seen censorship flaunted like it’s cool. 300+ pages of regs. were kept from the public before this passed in 2015. They would not disclose anything, even when prompted by 2 committee members. This shouldn’t even be in the hands of a federal agency. We’re just not going to agree on this. ☮️</p>

<p>the only effect we (as customers) are going to see is increased pricing on streaming services. we&#39;re not going to get all the tiered ISP pricing or all the other crap that the scaremongers are pushing. our money is a pittance compared to what the streaming services are bringing in. that&#39;s the cash cow the ISPs are wanting to get at. </p>
