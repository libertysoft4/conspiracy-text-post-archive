        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Edit: I can&#39;t change the title, but due to the suggestions from the comments this post isn&#39;t about capitalism as an economic system failing us, it&#39;s the people who have accrued vast amounts of wealth in one way or another that are influencing the system. Among other things. </p>

<p>This is a really long post about my opinions and views on a lot of things. I&#39;m looking for discussion, debates, to be called out. Anything and everything is on the table. I&#39;ve just been very frustrated lately with a lot of things. </p>

<p>It seems like no one takes reading seriously anymore. It’s tv this. Media that. And it’s appalling how little credit people give to the benefits of reading. It lets your mind create a beautiful universe within itself. You learn new words, how to use them. The educational benefit of reading is beyond what a lot of other activities can achieve. Some people never even read a book outside of what is required for school. I’m not shitting on people who watch tv, play sports, play video games or have other hobbies that take a bunch of their time. You can be just as smart as someone who reads from your own ability to retain information and need for understanding. I’m merely stating that a majority of people who refuse to read and never read growing up seem to lack a need for consistent understanding, have very little to no critical thinking skills, and are more complacent and willing to be led than to advocate for themselves. </p>

<p>Growing up I loved books. I started reading at a very young age, my mom was huge into Montessori and kept me away from television until I was closer to maybe 5 or so. Even when I started watching tv, the only ‘cartoons’ I really watched were on Toonami, way beyond my age but w/e, and then the history and discovery channel. I’m not bragging about my childhood, even if you’re exposed to tv at a young age it’s all about how you grow and your desire for knowledge, but I was always trying to devour the possibility of other realities and the sciences behind the world I lived in. </p>

<p>As I got older I obviously read fiction, some biographies, but mainly I gravitated towards dystopian themed reading as well as differIng realities and alternative universes. The science, mythology, and cultures displayed in these books were so diverse and really got me thinking for days on end, and sometimes even into the night when I could not sleep, of all the possibilities there could be within our vast and ever expanding universe. </p>

<p>All I see today are kids obsessing over the television. When they’re older it isn’t so bad bc they have the ability to reason and understand, applying what they see to real life or just enjoying the humor of the show. But here’s the thing. A vast majority of kids, way below the age of 5, have their own tablet or constant access to the TV. A mom I know even puts her kid to bed, he’s one, with a tablet playing Tangled every night bc it’s his favorite movie. </p>

<p>He. Can’t. Even. Fucking. Understand. What’s. Going. On. It’s all sounds and bright colors that do nothing but distract him. Before the age of two it can even effect their ability to develop language. They look to the people who they connect with the most to provide an example on how to act and speak, the words they begin to associate with meaning being derived from the way we move our lips as we talk with or around them. </p>

<p>By placing them in front of media they’re merely stimulating their attention instead of utilizing the child’s desire to learn and interact with the world around them. It’s instant gratification for the child, and a momentary relief for the parents or care takers. Lowkey the availability to divert responsibly for your decision is hindering the child’s development and harming them in the long run. This could just be my option based on various forms of research and understanding, but the opinions of media allowing children to interact with an ever changing advancement in technology does not outweigh the vital need to educate and encourage learning and development. </p>

<p>The people who should be consistently interacting with their children are often times over worked, over stressed, or live in an environment where their level of education is abysmal. This can lead to younger and younger generations having children. Without proper support systems in place these people struggle, fall into abusive relationships, have little or no sexual education, or are often times not developed enough to take on such a responsibility and can not understand the consequences to their actions. </p>

<p>Sometimes they develop abusive tendencies towards their children. They punish them for small mistakes instead of letting them learn and understand both sides of the situation and what went wrong. They discourage exploration and their natural desire to learn more about the world by telling them to stop talking and asking questions. I know kids can get annoying, but as someone who’s worked with kids a lot, esp in underprivileged areas, this type of parenting is common.  </p>

<p>This derives front the capitalistic environment that is pushed upon the majority of Americans. Get married. Have kids. Work for a living.  Die. Then your kids get to do the exact same thing. Aka the sub plot of They Live, which I highly recommend. </p>

<p>Now, after WWII the U.S implemented various forms of expansions upon our defensive branch of the military to combat the USSR and protect the country. The National Security Act of 1947 created the CIA and allowed it to act outside the boundaries of congress and give information on a need to know basis. Oh and operation paper clip which brought a ton of Nazi Scientists to the states. </p>

<p>Back to capitalism for a second, we took advantage of war torn European countries and a natural disaster to push upon the world a trade deal, where the production capability of the U.S, which was expanded upon by the very Nazi scientists we brought over. With the help of laborers, who were seeking out the American Dream, and our ability to mass produce cheap goods, our economy boomed. </p>

<p>From there our propaganda efforts, operations carried out by the CIA, and the exploitation of Europe allowed for the possibility of a communistic world government and economic opportunity to be entirely crushed. Communism bad. Capitalism good. Even the mentioning of Karl Marx, who predicted the overthrowing of an elite class taking advantage of their laborers, was dangerous. Not only was this a tactic to limit freedom of thought and free speech, but under the guise of advanced technology and the economic boom, America was able to portray itself as a free country. Even the ‘free flow of information’ project we undertook to combat communistic propaganda on global media, pushed the narrative that ‘science equals freedom’. </p>

<p>(Often times our text books push only the point of view that the country wants its population to believe in. It leaves out so much of what really happens, not to mention that the education system in this country is beyond fucking deplorable.)</p>

<p>This allowed for people to enjoy easy, cheap comforts. Why question your government when you can go home and listen to the radio, or watch T.V  and be told exactly what to think and feel. No need to stress yourself out anymore by looking into things after a long and hard day at work when you can simply dissociate and stimulate yourself with propaganda. Ingenious really. </p>

<p>Now, a social contract, aka our constitution, states that the government is to be elected by the people and for the people. It is clear that during the Cold War era that a lot of things changed, and that includes the availability of free and unbiased information. How are people supposed to truly consent to the election of government officials when a false narrative regarding who to vote for and what the majority needs is consistently being shoved down their throats. There is no transparency. And even when transparency is achieved, like when various CIA programs like MK-ULTRA and the operations we conducted overseas to gain power are exposed, no body fucking pays attention. That on top of limited coverage allows for the negative information to not be broadcast to the population. </p>

<p>So, pretty much our government is a sham being run by wealthy elite who are paid out by big businesses and the descendants of wealthy owners, who at this have been allowed to avoid emotions such as empathy and compassion and control the system and the population. </p>

<p>Operation mocking bird/blue bird/ monarch appeals to be greatly. The general idea is controlling media and pushing narratives and subliminal messages upon the public with cleverly hidden symbolism and ideas. With the government being paid out by businesses, and with the many ventures and money laundering operations carried out by the CIA, one can put two and two together to at least theorize that with all the mind control experimentation going on in secret, that today a majority of the media and content on tv is in one form or another desensitizing the population to certain narratives and ideas while pushing what to be ‘controlled truth’. </p>

<p>I hold some faith in the Illuminati conspiracy due to the very few fields of work Jewish people could occupy back in the day. They loaned out much needed cash on trade routes and charged interest, gaining revenue over the years. The business tactic worked wonders and allowed them to recover from any and all attacks they faced for varying races or issues with their presence. I’m not saying that the Illuminati is a Jewish organization at this point in time, but history and research points to the origins of the organization to be based on the pursuit of knowledge and wealth by the people who were oppressed for generations. </p>

<p>That’s not me saying ‘Jewish people are trying to take over the world’, but whether it be the Illuminati, the possibility of a differIng ancient organization, or just a recent group of people who are very driven to fuck over everyone for their own pleasure, something sinister is deff going on. It could also be something 100% different that any theory we have going around, but there is no denying that there is a ton of money coming from someone, somewhere that is influencing powers across the globe. </p>

<p>So pretty much America is a controlled environment study in a way where the public is not only oppressed, but misled by the media and pacified with objects that distract us from the troubles of life. Progressive issues that revolve around racism, gender equality, and the LGBT community are pushed to the forefront of our everyday lives. The issues that /actually/ matter suddenly don’t. It allows for very combative arguments to take place on issues that truly only matter in the short term when you think about the change we can achieve if we actually elect true, educated and for the people candidates on both side. It distracts us. Gives us something to fight for or against while not thinking about the reasons such issues actually exist. </p>

<p>Stepping away from capitalism, the pizzagate, satanic pedophile rings among the elite is a completely different story. </p>

<p>For years people have been talking about the possibility. I mean, if you have the money to get away with anything why would your warped sense of entitlement and need for more not drive you to obtain the unobtainable. I have no doubt that people at the top have a trafficking ring where children come in and out. And if you look into the mind control experiments and scientific theories of breaking down free will and reprogramming someone, esp someone as vulnerable as a child, the laughable accusation can start seeming like a legitimate theory if and only if there exists people who are actually that fucked up. </p>

<p>The use of ‘satanic’ rituals and the implementation of brutal mutilation, rape and murder would deff traumatize a child and leave them with the impression that you truly were part of something evil and in possession of otherworldly powers. This allows for complete control. No matter what evidence they could ever encounter discrediting what they now know as reality, the mass amount of trauma they’ve experienced would simply not allow for them to believe anything else. </p>

<p>I mean, obvs some of the videos on worldcorpo could have been placed there as fake videos to get a shock or rise out of the viewers. You can’t deny the possibility, but I was one of the fucked up kids who heard about the ‘snuff’ and gore films and sites on the web and searched them out to see if they actually existed. And they did.</p>

<p>The quality and content on the worldcorpo site remind me exactly of the nitty-gritty quality and content displayed on those same gore sites. Even some of the most fucked up, attempting to seem legit,fake videos have never made me feel as sick to my stomach as the ones on worldcorpo. </p>

<p>Also on YouTube, I think elsagate has been covered enough, but bebotsonly is a Filipino ‘charity’ that offers to take your child and give them access to proper health care and a home in America. They can succeed. But, the channel is full of pedophilia. The young girls are interviewed and often times asked ‘do you care if your friends are older? Much older?’ To which they reply, ‘no. It’s about personalities.’  A majority of them are clearly underage and the titles refer to them as ‘hot’ and ‘sexy’. On top of that the channel also have toy reviews, repair instructions, and virtually any other topic that would lead someone to a video where their pedophilia ring would then be brought to the suggested videos or autoplayed. It exposes a wide audience to the availability of their ‘product’. The videos get more and more conceding as you continue watching. </p>

<p>As someone who frequently suffers from dissociation due to childhood trauma, it’s easy to not question the things around you when the individuals in your life are telling you what to think and feel. They shape your reality. Even now, some social and emotional situations are skewed for me due to my past. It’s easier to detach and accept what’s happening instead of questioning the situation and making the situation even more stressful. It’s easy to see why people who are content with their lives do not want to put effort into expanding their knowledge and question the troubling things around them. The popular quote ‘mind numbing tv’ is a perfect example of modern day mass dissociation. (Which btw in that sort of state you’re highly impressionable. That was one of the theories the CIA pushed to the forefront of scientific study during the Cold War. Many academic researchers were paid out by the CIA, often times unknowingly, to explore that subject.’  </p>

<p>And then, when you try and discuss literally anything outside of the media you’re hit with ‘fake news’ or ‘where are the sources’. They only accept mainstream reports. Refuse to critically think for themselves. Demand instant information be given, when in reality a little bit of reading and following the red flags displayed in a majority of the topics would reveal more than me listing things out point by point. </p>

<p>And then lol. They get aggressive. No matter how calm I am the people I try and speak with just shut down and refuse to even listen. They’re right.  I’m wrong. Nothing more. Nothing less. They only side with their political party and don’t even care about he candidates. Trying to talk to them is like trying to talk to a brick wall. </p>

<p>Republican led states have fewer environmental protection plans in place. Lower education standards. Profit off of religion. They don’t even treat their constituents like sheep. They lead them like goats, poking and prodding them with racial and LGBT related issues to drive them to vote republican. Minorities don’t steal all the jobs. They are not the only ones benefiting from welfare. Fuck,a majority of people in the Deep South rely off of disability or welfare due to labor intensive, dangerous work environments. </p>

<p>If their education system actually pushed them to succeed then maybe they’d live better lives. It’s not gays or minorities infringing upon their individual rights. It’s the representatives they vote into office. </p>

<p>Even under democratic majority education is still a joke. </p>

<p>I lost a majority of my vision due to retinal detachments in freshman year. My school was awarded multiple grants by placing me under an IEP, which helped a ton with the resources they provided, but the stipulation was that I needed to be in assisted teaching classes. Aka remedial. I went from honors my whole life to fucking remedial. And even when I passed tests showing that I could be accepted into AP, my current assistance teacher cited my ‘lack of motivation’ and ‘negative attitude towards my current classes’ as reason enough to keep me out. </p>

<p>They kept bringing in already paid for programs that offered me what I didn’t need, took me out of class and deducted from my education to try and give me training on dealing with my newfound disability, and when I tried to advocate for myself and fix the situation, bc all I fucked needed was to be treated like everyone else, the special education directed said I had ‘attitude issues’ and was ‘ungrateful.’ </p>

<p>Lol she brought in someone who was there to potentially diagnose me with a learning or behavioral disorder and had me sit through 5 sessions where I fucking answered ‘how does this make you feel’ questions and roll balls around on a table to complete puzzles. </p>

<p>Due to the money they received by exploiting my disability my school was able to suppress my need and ability to learn. I sound salty, and I am, but the point is money is keeping kids in classes they don’t belong in. </p>

<p>Multiple kids in these classes were only there for behavioral issues stemming from abusive homes. They were smart, and motivated, but given the chance to relax and not have to try, they took the opportunity and ran with it. Instead of investing into their future, providing support and possibly prying a rad into what would help them succeed, these people we w exploited. The whole time the school received money for helping out students in need. </p>

<p>Back to politics. Democrats aren’t much better. They rely on the minority’s vote to get them elected and their proposed solutions to inequality are often inadequate and don’t address the issue directly. </p>

<p>The lack of education. </p>

<p>They lead the forefront on progressive issues, but partake in the same overseas economic gain that the other elites do and benefit off of businesses and even with fucking millions to their name and certain corporations behind them, still bleed the grass roots movement dry by targeting the passionate, and often times retired life long democrats, to fuel their campaigns. </p>

<p>True grass root candidates are out there, but get very little attention unless there is money driving their campaign. We need money out of politics on both sides. </p>

<p>Don’t even get me started on the plethora of pacs and organizations that outsource professional solicitation office that reel in  a million and then charge $850 thousand for fees. It’s a scam. They employ a lot of passionate, underprivileged college students trying to make a living. Or offer jobs to people with criminal records trying to change their lives. Homeless people who need money to save themselves. Addicts who need flexibility and understanding. Thiey allow flexible hours,  hire compassionate staff, and more often than not only end up corrupt at the top. They exploit passionate people who need their job and feel good about what they’re doing by lying to them, exploiting the lack of cohesive solicitation laws across the states and even call on behalf of fake pacs that drop all their money into solicitation. </p>

<p>Our whole fucking system is a ploy to drain the majority and keep them busy enough to not notice the warning signs. </p>

<p>It disgusts me. Absolutely and entirely makes me sick to my stomach and the sad thing is, there is nothing I can do about it now.  I’m very young. </p>

<p>I’m going to school for economics and political science to try and reroute resources to offer educational and support programs in areas across the country. I love children and believe that so many people just need a little bit of compassion and the motivation to get somewhere in life. </p>

<p>I’ve grown up all over the states. My parents moved often. They were working class, desperately trying to keep up and provide me with a stable environment. It never worked. Stress was a constant for them. It was a constant for me. </p>

<p>But having moved a lot, I’ve lived in a lot of underprivileged areas. They’re all the same. Shitty schools. Community programs can run 200+ to even be involved in. The availability of jobs is scarce. Rent is high. No one even knows who represents them. It wasn’t until 3rd or 4th grade that my teacher, someone who my mom tried to get fired from speaking like this, told the class about why bush moved troops into the Middle East. </p>

<p>She said it was a lack of information. Miscommunication. Trying to accomplish something that wasn’t being talked about. There was a lot she didn’t know, but she treated us like someone who would understand the basics. She told us that political party doesn’t matter. It’s about who these people are as a person that will make them a good leader. She told us about the upcoming candidates for the house race and let us choose who we would vote for. It was an eye opening experience. </p>

<p>Kids adopt their parents habits. Parents who don’t receive any help or support crumble, desperately trying to provide for themselves and their children. They fall into a trap. </p>

<p>Drug use is common. It helps numb the pain. Not all drugs are bad, but big pharma can make a ton criminalizing natural remedies. Mind opening drugs really do connect you to the world on a deeper level, and that’s exactly why a tab of acid can land you in jail for 7 years in some states. They force you to be miserable and then punish you for attempting to escape from how awful things are. </p>

<p>I’m just. So. Frustrated. Not only is our entire system down to the fucking core a complete joke, but trying to do something about what is potentially going wrong is deemed ‘outside the box’ and you’re labeled as someone who’s uneducated and ill informed. No one wants to listen. If I’m being honest, I don’t think a lot of people have the ability to listen or actually think about things differently or on a deeper level. </p>

<p>Conspiracies are a way to think critically about issues, unless they’re completely fucking off, but even then the issue got someone thinking on a deeper level. That’s good. Thinking is good. But the system in place, not just in America, is extremely oppressive due to misleading the public and providing simple comforts, or by using fear and violence to keep people in check. No one is free. We are led to believe we’re free, but we’re far from it. </p>

<p>Mental illness is finally being looked into, but maybe?? JUST MAYBE?? The skyrocketing number of diagnosed cases of depression, anxety, personality disorders, varying other forms of mental illness are being caused, or at least being made worse, by the insane amount of misery the system leads us to believe is normal. </p>

<p>Our food is filled with sugar. The bacteria in our gut is all fucked up and the our ability to absorb nutrients is a mess. Yes some vaccines can be bad if you are predisposed to a condition and there are no tests to check and make sure your child is A-okay to be given some of them (America even has the heaviest scheduel for administration). Technology can be helpful, but the obsession we have today is un-fucking-healthy. The use of unsafe pesticides should be a criminal charge. Exploiting impoverished nations should be considered a violation on human rights. No. One. Cares. Tho. Or they&#39;re unaware. </p>

<p>If anyone actually read this far please do read Brave New World, 1984, Animal Farm, Lord of the Flies, all books given to us in HS to read that no one ever actually reads or learns from. They’re simple, easy to get through and say a lot about what is currently going on today. Doing your own research into online public academic research databases also helps. You’re exposed to world views on so many varying topics that really puts a lot of things into perspective. </p>

<p>Also, absolutely love hearing people’s ideas and opinions. Getting into debates on how we feel about certain issues allows both parties to learn things and hear different perspectives other than my your own. It adds a level of enrichment to your life. You only know your life. Your reality. It isn’t just about you, ya know. And yet, so many fucking people are self absorbed and unable to admit they’re wrong or learn from another. Ik, psychology blah blah. Humans are defensive when they’re confronted and are provided information on how they could be wrong on something, or may not know everything, but being open minded is probably one of the best skills someone can develop. </p>

<p>This whole fucking essay is a trip. I’m just so angry and fed up with the system. With life. With reality, whatever the fuck it may be. A lot of the meat in this text wall is just lowkey conspiracies that are blatant and open to the public, but no one wants to address or even talk about. It’s right there in front of everyone, but the system leads everyone to believe that there is nothing wrong. </p>

<p>Ignorance is bliss. Speaking out against ignorance is deemed absolutely crazy. ‘You’re looking too into things.’ ‘Where are you cnn verified sources?’  ‘You’re too young to be talking about things like this. You know nothing.’ &#39;Someone forgot to put their tinfoil hat on today.&#39;</p>

<p>Rant rant. I&#39;m done. I&#39;ve talked about this so much with my friend who offers a lot of insite and opinion on my views and this is mainly to gain more information and ideas from the various people who post and read through this thread. Please do tell me if I&#39;m wrong on any topic. Feel free to call me out. Or discuss/ debate. Add information. Come at me with anything. I left out a lot of theories I look into and enjoy bc they didn&#39;t fit into the exploitation/ignorance/capitalistic driven things I wanted to talk about. </p>

<p>Ik I added a lot of personal information, but those experiences have helped shape who I am today and why I try and question and learn about absolutely anything and everything. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I dont really see how this is about Capitalism... The short part you did talk about capitalism in seems to be almost entirely the government&#39;s fault, no? I mean, besides the whole consumerism part (slave to consume, make baby, die) which is a social issue and not directly to the fault of private ownership of the means of production. Id argue youre more against Corporatism/Plutocracy than Capitalism itself. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have a really good point actually, and I may change the title to my post. I wasn&#39;t actively thinking about where the problem with the current state of capitalism derives from, and that&#39;s from the top. Corporatism was something I vaguely remember seeing before, and after a quick search that is exactly the issue I have with the system today. I&#39;m about to dive more into the topic to learn more. It&#39;s not the economic system in place that&#39;s causing the issues, it&#39;s the very small amount of people who have accrued the wealth in one way or another that are influencing the way things are. </p>

<p>Thank you for the comment. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you may be confused about capitalism.  An economic system is not the reason our world reaps iniquity.  It&#39;s just us.  Our actions.  Our moral relativism and our consent to the psychopaths who create chaos and sell the solution to us.</p>

<p>I think the ills you speak of are more the product of industrialization rather than the form in which is manifests.  If we magically just shifted to another economic system it would still require energy, resources and labor.  What&#39;s your alternative to capitalism?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Someone already pointed out that flaw, but thank you. </p>

<p>I&#39;m huge into ethics and completely agree that a major issue is within our own moral inconsistencies, but my argument against that is that the moral agenda being pushed today is skewed. Yes, some theorists state that ethcis lie within and that we know our moral duties at heart, and that stepping away from such ideals is morally wrong, but how can the majority of people come to proper conclusions and deem whether an action is ethical or not when they&#39;re misled and force fed information in an altered state of mind? The majority should be held morally responsible for their lack of knowledge on the topic and their lack of motivation to gain information, but rn can you blame them? </p>

<p>That&#39;s where my frustration stems from mainly. I don&#39;t know whether to try and emphasize with people who are so stressed out and consumed by their own personal trauma and life situation or to blame them for not getting their shit together and making a different. </p>

<p>And, it&#39;s not the economic system in place, it&#39;s those who exploit the system to their advantage that damage any economic system that could be implemented. </p>

<p>I personally don&#39;t have any issue with capitalism. From my understanding, trickle down economics is an extremely valid system that works when practiced properly. It&#39;s all about investing back what you gain from the system in the form of taxes and the purchasing of products from within the country. Our country is much too large to implement a truly socialistic economic system in its current state, even though a lot of my own generation wants that to happen, and the current programs we do have are flawed and under regulated. Idk man. </p>

<p>That&#39;s why I asked for opinions and discussion. Once again thank you for your comment, and if you have any suggestions on fixing the current system please do post them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>People see a society with ills and think that government or law can alleviate some of them.  And instead of individuals taking on responsibility to cure those ills they abdicate their rights and property to governments in exchange for governments solving problems.</p>

<p>Governments are for organizing to protect against external enemies and establishing courts of justice.  Obviously as well as legislating.  But that should be limited because every law we enact always serves to prop up a small privileged class as the dismay of the masses.</p>

<p>When we fund large governments we only provide the collateral the Luciferian cabal needs to drown states in debt, wage war and consolidate control of resources and power.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>And at the core, correct me if I&#39;m wrong, is exactly what the true republican party wants to achieve by getting into office. </p>

<p>Taking away power from our government would allow for less debt to accrue and for more transparency between the government and the people. With less resources flowing in and out of various branches there would be more for the economy to benefit from. </p>

<p>But, I don&#39;t think a lot of people understand that and completely agree with how they divert responsibility in exchange of rights and property, which is why most civilizations end up within a social contract of sorts, They consent to their leadership. </p>

<p>What I&#39;m wondering is what you would think would be best to implement in order to to fix the issues that allow the current government to remain blame free. It&#39;s the lack of education, misleading narratives and social and economic woes that end up trapping people into not being in a place to speak out. </p>

<p>Right now, under the current narrative of the U.S, the people at the top of the Republican party are evil and even true, down to earth Republicans are not gaining momentum due to everyone trusting even the most vile Democrat. Fuck, even some Republicans voted for Hillary. We can&#39;t restrict our government under most democratic representation and rn democrats are winning house seats across the country. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree 100% with every single thing you wrote. The elite and wealthy own the politicians—through the relation of campaign finance and lobbying —and the politicians use wedge issues and manufactured drama to keep the masses fighting amongst themselves instead of paying attention to how they are being fucked over by the politicians. Both major parties are corrupt but the elite and politicians win by getting the masses to view political parties as sports teams. Tribalism is championed and the masses fall prey to it every time. The voting system is rigged through the major parties and their rules and through the mainstream media which dictates which candidates get X amount of time on TV and newspapers vs others.</p>

<p>People don&#39;t understand that if you control the media then you control what the masses believe. The media is the window looking out onto the world. Without the media then everyone would be deaf, dumb and blind about everything that&#39;s going on around them.</p>

<p>The education system is a crumbling mess because if the masses were truly educated then it would be bad for those in power. Better to compell people to go to college so they can be enchained by crippling debt which will make them docile, subservient and a good wage slave while the rich fleece them.</p>

<p>I have an open mind and will listen to any viewpoint and give it due contemplation but so many blindly refuse to educate themselves on what socialism actually is and what capitalism actually is. They won&#39;t pick up a book or debate or read written views different from their own. They just parrot what their parents told them and what they&#39;ve been brainwashed to believing as adolescents. People in this very subreddit, for instance.</p>

<p>The wealthy and elite have brainwashed the poor to be against their own self interests. Socialism is the big evil and is blindly synonymous with the USSR because if actually looked into and studied and then attempted it would be bad for the wealthy and elite. That&#39;s why capitalism has somehow become synonymous with <em>freedom</em> and <em>democracy</em>.</p>

<p>This faux shock and condescension is so played out. You can&#39;t keep bringing up Stalin and Mao as some sort of trumped up Boogeymen that neatly explains away the entirety of socialism. It&#39;s an old tired Republican argument banted about by those who don&#39;t know what socialism actually is and isn&#39;t. Having this argument on Reddit gets so old I really should just have stuff typed up and ready to go so I can just copy and paste it without wasting my time and energy arguing with people I know won&#39;t listen.</p>

<p>Is capitalism not responsible for 100+ years of slavery and racism and Jim Crow and the slaughter and extermination of millions of Native Americans? Has capitalism not been responsible for untold millions of deaths? This is a two way street when you want to equate an econmic model with the misdeeds of human beings.</p>

<p>What is socialism? Do you not even know that there are various factions under the banner of socialism and subgroups that disagree on what a socialist state would even look like? No, you don&#39;t. Educate yourself. This tired old talking point spewed out to somehow discredit socialism is laughable to anyone with knowledge of history and what socialism actually is.</p>

<p>See, there it goes. It never fails. It&#39;s exactly what OP wrote about and I initially wrote about. People in general—not just you—can&#39;t stand to listen/read opinions that differ from their concrete set view of things that they just turn off and take their ball home and run. It&#39;s like a mental block. God forbid you are wrong and what you parrot from what you heard from your parents turns out to be wrong. God forbid you expand your mind and actually understand something—socialism—that you hate even though you lack knowledge of. What a microcosm of society. Revert back into the warm embrace of tribalism.</p>

<p>Watch Ken Burns&#39; recent series The Vietnam War. Johnson and Nixon both were clear sociopaths and got millions killed. That&#39;s history. That&#39;s fact. You quickly dismiss it because it flies in the face of what you&#39;ve been indoctrinated with. Get out of your box and at least educate yourself. I mean my god, you are on a conspiracy subreddit for god sakes. George W. Bush is a war criminal who ran CIA torture black sites around the globe and started a war and invaded a country on false pretenses and trumped up evidence. None of which is a lie.

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s the fear of an educated majority that drives a lot of the inequalities. People catch on. Start putting two and two together and then they trace everything back to the source. 100% agree. And a lot of my generation advocate for socalism. Bernie really took off during 2016. It was the media black out that truly hurt this country. It left a lot of people feeling betrayed and misled. Which is good. But now they&#39;re distrusting of both parties and feel like their votes truly don&#39;t matter. </p>

<p>On the matter of socalism, it&#39;s not a bad system if your country can implement it correctly. The country of America is far too large and in massive loads of shit to implement a true socialistic policy, but we have adopted welfare programs and certain forms of socalistic health care that benifits those who suffer the most. They&#39;re flawed due to exploitation and the lack of regulation. The lack of care when implementing such programs gives socialism a bad name. </p>

<p>Communism WAS somthing to fear if implemented improperly, so I see why the U.S took it so seriously with how the USSR had been operating, but the idea of it being purely evil and abhorrent was misleading beyond belief. It would start giving people ideas of being owed what they labored for, and that was much more than our system was willing to give them. </p>

<p>Community college should be free. It&#39;s the degrees that get super intensive and rely on pure dedication and the ability to actually keep up and preform that should be privatized, but avaliable to those who prove themselves throughout their academic career. Trade schools, aside from vocational bc they&#39;re already a thing, should be placed across the country and free, or at make affordable , to the population to take advantage of. It benifits small businesses. Allows for an actual competitive environment among businesses as well and gives the majority who don&#39;t want to go to school something to build their lfie around. 
Min wage jobs are going to die out and certain trade areas will not be affected due to the AI. </p>

<p>Public education should be equally invested in and I see no issue with promising education, as long as they pay taxes and don&#39;t don&#39;t deduct from the funding or public schools. Fuck. Charter. Schools. </p>

<p>Our jobs need to stop being outsourced. Corporations should not be considered a person and their taxation rate needs to be raised bc they don&#39;t do shit but buy their own shares and invest nothing into the economy. </p>

<p>We need to roll back government spending and implement programs that help out those who are in bad situations, instead of giving them money and food while only offering them shitty min wage jobs that are getting them no where in life. Once we start actually making a difference in capitalism and actually get that trickle down effect going, I don&#39;t see why we couldn&#39;t raise taxes for certain things and prop up true socalistic programs that benifited everyone on all levels. </p>

<p>I agree. I think automation is the only possible current wage for socialism to take place in the United States. Automation and the proceeding lack of jobs and thus income will lead us down the path of socialism.

<p>Stalin and the proceeding leaders of the USSR perverted communism and because of that to Americans communism and socialism has become synonymous with totalitarianism and dictatorships. When you look up the definition of communism—a stateless, classless society—and compare it to the USSR it doesn&#39;t even fit. Too many people won&#39;t educate themselves on what socialism actually is and if they did they&#39;d find nothing about state dictatorships and totalitarian governments anywhere. I&#39;m an anarchist, for example. There are a myriad of subgroups under the banner of socialism and disagreements on what a socialist state would actually look like.</p>

<p>100% agree. When many hear about &quot;free college&quot; today they balk but they fail to realize that public schools and regular K thru 12 education only became free for most people during the 1950s and 1960s. It would be the same idea.</p>

<p>I agree 100% except for the attempt to humanize and revitalize capitalism. It won&#39;t work. The main objective of capitalism has always been exploitation via the profit motive. The few exploiting the many for profit. That&#39;s its motto. Yet we as a society have attempted to humanize capitalism by giving it the trappings of socialism—social security, healthcare, unions, worker rights, a minimum wage, ect.—but it doesn&#39;t work.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In defense of your opinion I should not have said &#39;if implemented improperly &#39;. </p>

<p>Communism to me is a flawed system that into benifits those who are gifted with natural talent and have access to higher education to allow for them to rise to a higher social standard, while leaving those who lack in the dust. Yeah they get a little, but low key that&#39;s still wrong. </p>

<p>Communism coming from the USSR was bad and our country did the right thing by fighting against it, but we also demonized a ton of socalistic systems which would have benifited the workers. The workers labor for their wage and are highly underpaid, esp with prices in product and rising rent etc. It allowed for the owners of businesses to profit at the expense of those who trusted in them. </p>

<p>Like I said in my original post it was our complete and utter stance against any form of system other than capitalism that was harmful. Karl Marx was demonized. He could have never imagined a country such as our own when writing his manifesto, but he made a ton of good points. </p>

<p>Socalism has many varying forms ranging from market based to non market based. Idk how non market based works. But the workers are entitled to more than their given. They should have shares and stocks within the company, esp after working their and giving it their all. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great post, and mirrors the alienation that many are feeling.  I think you are a lot closer on emphasizing capitalism and social relations that constitute it as responsible for the alienation that is experienced.   Capital is a social relation between people that appears like its just relations between things.  And the world we encounter appears as irrational.</p>

<p>Now, after WWII the U.S implemented various forms of expansions... </p>
</blockquote>

<p>During this period, schools across the US were consolidated from small (often one-room), locally controlled schools where the families who funded and sent their children to the schools were in control of the curriculum, staff, and schedule to larger &quot;school districts&quot;. </p>

<p>The districts, since then have been on a one-way path toward homogenization of subject material (information), methods, structure, and instilled values (like capitalism). Education is supposed to be explicitly the realm of state governments which are supposed to be laboratories of Democracy. Since WWII, both local districts and state governments have increasingly deferred to the federal government for guidance and funding of education, thus perpetuating this homogenization. The effect of this centralization is to create a static, lowest-common-denominator environment, one which is increasingly failing its mission to prepare children for life as productive adults.</p>

<p>What this homogenization has been wildly successful at is creating consumers. One is led to wonder if this pattern is happenstance or by design.</p>

<p>I’m just. So. Frustrated. Not only is our entire system down to the fucking core a complete joke, but trying to do something about what is potentially going wrong is deemed ‘outside the box’ and you’re labeled as someone who’s uneducated and ill informed. No one wants to listen. If I’m being honest, I don’t think a lot of people have the ability to listen or actually think about things differently or on a deeper level. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nah dude. I didn&#39;t take it like you&#39;re on edge. You&#39;re  more than fine. I just spent a lot of time writing on my phone notepad today when I had free time and felt like it was a tad too long. I don&#39;t see many long posts on Reddit. </p>

<p>I actually really appreciate what you just said, so thank you. </p>
