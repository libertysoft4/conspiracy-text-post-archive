<p>On the other hand, there is not a single legitimate piece of evidence to support the idea that reptilian shape shifting creatures have infiltrated positions of power. So why even bother bringing it up? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s my problem with the sub...</p>

<p>To me, the &quot;conspiracy&quot; IS the NWO. </p>

<p>The goal of the elites to dominate the globe and create a global government that rules over all of us. Every other conspiracy song the elites is just a &quot;mini conspiracy&quot; toward this grand plan of a global takeover.</p>

<p>People have been dreaming of taking over the globe and enslaving the population for years. They bags convened and organized for centuries. Now they think they have the technology to actually go through with it.</p>

<p>but there is a massive awakening of humanity happening in the background of all of this. I&#39;m on that side. That&#39;s pretty much all I can say. </p>

<p>Lol how so? The majority here know Alex jones is a shill, We know Pizzagate is real, we know extraterrestrial life exists, we know there is an agenda to create a world government, and we know Freemasons have Infiltrated positions of power. We&#39;re smarter than you think.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a lot of fucking &quot;noise&quot; on this and other conspiracy subs. That fact we don&#39;t buy a lot of the outlandish shit that has no evidence to support it, shouldn&#39;t be a problem.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just because it sounds ridiculous doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s not true.
For a time, talking about trillions of tiny creatures that you can&#39;t see, that can make you sick, that are all through the air and all throughout every living thing was absurd. It took 200 years from first observation to a fully formed understanding of germ theory.  Failure to believe in it does not make it any less factual.
Appropriately enough, believing the Earth to be a globe was considered ludicrous at one stage (only thing I&#39;ve taken from flat Earth is that almost all images of the Earth from space are composites, NASA admits this. As well as, footage from within the ISS is not as it seems - everyone should know that)</p>

<p>I do agree that it is convenient that there is no real proof.. Icke talks about the electromagnetic spectrum, visible/invisible light and the frequencies the reptilians operate at and yet there&#39;s no way to photograph such beings.<br/>
We have to take his word for it, based on so many other things found to be true, learnt on an ayahuasca trip; the descriptions given by mediums/psychics or video anomalies where public figures have reptilian eyes.</p>

<p>Same with David Icke.  I understand that there is scripture regarding reptilian entities.  But Icke is the figure that claimed that the people ruling is are reptiles in the literal sense. And it sounds ridiculous when no proof is provided. You would agree it creates a negative stigma to the conspiracy culture, no? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>try actually reading one of david ickes 700 page books and then you can make assumptions. if you are too skeptical to do substantial research you should try checkers or yahtzee instead. calling the theory &quot;goofy&quot; shows you can make labels but are in fact too intellectually lazy to actually research the subject you ridicule.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have read the books, as have many of us who still deny his theories. Many of the things he says and references are true, but there is that 10% of outlandish, and yes, goofy theories that are designed to turn people away from his information. That&#39;s what a gatekeeper does. </p>

<p>This is starting to catch on within the conspiracy culture as you can see </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think we should look at &quot;Reptilians&quot; as the people who have had some form of lobotomy/&quot;enhancement&quot;, ie, their reptilian brain rules behavior and decision-making. I don&#39;t believe they can alter their appearance, but I think they are psychopaths. </p>

<p>As for appearance-shifting, that&#39;s demonologists. Those fuckers are scary, because they think they have powers. Which again, I think is something else regulating the human emotional response. </p>

<p>The good news is the basic human spirit is stronger than these attempts at deity - incantation. </p>

<p>Completely agree AJ is disinfo and a psy-op. Have been in this sub over 4 years and still haven&#39;t read any Icke. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am torn on this one.  On one hand there is good evidence to suggest that Reptilians are those who operate from the R Complex.  The part of the brain - and this is the limit of a Reptile brain - that operates from fear and survival instincts.  </p>

<p>On the other hand I have read Scripture, history and traveled to Bolivia and without a doubt there are myths and history involving Reptilians.  And we&#39;re not even touching on one of the fundamental motifs of human culture, the dragon and snake.</p>

<p>So I&#39;d say there is plenty out there to keep the conversation alive and not close our minds to a mystery.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think there is always a possibility.  Icke really strikes me as sincere and has been consistent over the years.  Obviously I don&#39;t know the man so I really don&#39;t know.  Someone like Jones...I&#39;ve seen his journey and it looks like the demons are eating him alive.  </p>

<p>My best guess is that Icke truly wants to spread the word about what is going on but knows the truth is really only allowed to be distributed as entertainment or satire.  Much like the jester of old and the stand up comedian of today.  Being an entertainer I think he veils these hard truths with the cover of the Reptilians...but that doesn&#39;t mean they don&#39;t exist.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I definitely understand why you are skeptical.  I am as well.  I don&#39;t think someone like Icke is installed, rather they are useful in locating the demographics, behavior, etc of those who are attracted to this information and then anyone who deems an individual as a threat can be marginalized.  </p>

<p>I think we could probably agree that Icke would be marginalized if he was deemed a threat but is probably seen as an asset since his material is now associated with conspiracy loonies.  That&#39;s not his fault though...he doesn&#39;t stand a chance against the broad powers of social manipulation and associating certain words/symbols/ideas 
with values...</p>
