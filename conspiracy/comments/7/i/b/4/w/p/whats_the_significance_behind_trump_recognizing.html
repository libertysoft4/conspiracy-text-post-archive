    <div class="md"><p>This is the biggest geopolitical news since 9/11 and will prove to be bigger in the days ahead.  </p>

<p>This is speculation on my part but here goes:
World peace is what the headlines will declare because there is no feud deeper and longer running than the Hebrews and Arabs.  Therefore this announcement and change will force the hands of both parties to the negotiating table.  Not yet but it is coming.  For now people will rail on this policy, etc but it will cause a forward movement to the peace process.  I don&#39;t think the peace will last but this will cause forward progress in the negotiations.  The Arab world will capitulate part of the Temple Mount for the Jews to rebuild their temple.  For a time all will be well but cracks in the peace will start showing and then the dam will burst and an all out war will take place.  According to biblical prophecy...  I&#39;m not a bible scholar but my understanding is Russia, Iran and probably china will go to an all out war at some point with Israel, and Jerusalem is the focus point of it all.<br/>
If you look at the power of the middle eastern (Arab) countries it&#39;s because of oil and I imagine Israel will find some oil too and break the Russian/ Arab oil reserve domination which could cause them to align to attack Israel.  It could be a proxy war with the US since Israel is the main ally of The United States in the region.  Regardless we know Iran and Israel have bad blood and have been at war...  Iran using hezbollah as their fighting force for now.  </p>

<p>As a precursor to this and probably due to a series of events- war? Plague? Alien invasion? There will be a one world government power rise up that will basically force the hand of the peace process and get the ball rolling to however my speculative scenario plays out.  </p>

<p>Take my scenario or leave it, regardless, Jerusalem will start to dominate the news and focus of the world in the days to come...  this could be days, months or years away but Jerusalem will become a flash point for all the world at some point.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jerusalem is home to a half million Arabs. The Temple Mount is home to an Arab religious complex. Jerusalem was &quot;taken over&quot; by the Israeli military in 1967 an to avoid outrage they spared these two things. But Israelis want Jerusalem. It&#39;s their spiritual capital. 2,000 years ago. So what they have to do is incrementally take over Jerusalem. This kind of thing is a increment. They couldn&#39;t move the embassy until the West Bank security barrier was built. This is all incremental. Plans to do this are at least 20 years old.  They actually have a portion of the Al Aqsa Mosque partitioned off for Israeli soldiers. They just wait and wait and gradually they&#39;re able to make these place bigger and bigger and eventually theirs. Extremely passive aggressive. Really ugly stuff. </p>

<p>So now, if  anything happens to the new American embassy, (which their will) then Israel can use it as an excuse to start dealig with the hundreds of thousands of Arabs in East Jerusalem. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why does an American embassy move to Jerusalem, an Israeli city, make the Arabs so mad?</p>

<p>Are they angry because they now that they have to fight US too in a war to get back Jerusalem. I don’t know the end times scenario in Islamic faith but don’t some of them believe in waging war on Israel again?</p>

<p>Why should Americans want those type of people to take over anything? The historical scoreboard for them isn’t to great.. It sounds like they are in a very hard situation after losing the war in 1967. After losing wars, the winning side usually gets to set the rules of the treaty and then force the losing side into signing it. That’s just how it works and a sad fact of life.. </p>

<p>Israel is definitely not helping I’m sure.. but I don’t think Palestine is doing all the best either with a final solution not yet in sight.</p>

If Israelis had their way the entire planet would be a police checkpoint. That&#39;s not going to happen.

    <div class="md"><p>This is import because the Bible says that the Third Temple will be built during the Tribulations on the same location as the First Temple of Solomon and the Second Temple of Herod which archeologists believe is on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem. Prophecy says in order for the Third Temple to be built the Ark of the Covenant has to be recovered. At first, the Antichrist will show himself and then 3 1/2 yrs later, Christ will return. Check out this article about the Ark of the Convent being in Yemen.</p>
