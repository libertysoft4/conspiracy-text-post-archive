Under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), publicly funded schools are required to appropriately accommodate children with every manner of disability so that the children can participate in the educational environment. Under IDEA, an individualized education program (IEP) is formed for a disabled child and the necessary accommodations are decided upon and created by the school. In general, modifications for disabled students can be divided into five categories: accessibility, transportation, classroom, physical education and discipline. Accessibility Rules Under the ADA Under the ADA rules, all classrooms must be wheelchair accessible. This includes installation of an elevator in two-story school buildings. Additionally, ramps and handicapped parking are required for facilitating easy access to school buildings.Bathrooms must have wheelchair accessible toilets and a lowered sink. In lunchrooms, there must be wheelchair accessible tables. On playgrounds, many schools offer specialized equipment so that wheelchair bound children can use the playground and enjoy their recess freely.</p>

<p>The victims families had their houses paid off all on Christmas week. In honor of the Sandi H00k victims , at the Superbowl halftime show, the children who were supposed to be murdered were singing live on television.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.blacklistednews.com/Sandi_H00k%27s_Dead_Children_Seen_Alive_Singing_At_2013_Super_Bowl%3A_Conspiracy_or_Disinformation%3F/31405/0/5/5/Y/M.html">http://www.blacklistednews.com/Sandi_H00k%27s_Dead_Children_Seen_Alive_Singing_At_2013_Super_Bowl%3A_Conspiracy_or_Disinformation%3F/31405/0/5/5/Y/M.html</a></p>

<p>according to recently released FBI crime statistics, there were no murders in Newtown in 2012, despite the reports of a mass shooting claiming the lives of several schoolchildren and faculty staff. This has raised suspicions, as no murders were recorded unlike in the statistics that same year for the state of Colorado, which showed that 29 murders occurred in Aurora – accounting for the mass shooting at the Century Theatre cinema during a midnight screening of The Dark Night Rises.
Veterans Today also points out other inconsistencies that have questioned what really happened at Sandi H00k. One is that emergency protocols that one would expect to be carried out after such an event, were not actually followed. Emergency vehicles did not line or blockade the street, trauma helicopters were not called in, and the scene was eerily calm and bloodless - not as frantic and chaotic as it should’ve been if such a tragedy were to occur.
Another strange circumstance is the behaviour of the parties involved, such as officials and even the parents of the victims. A YouTube video showing medical examiner Wayne Carver seemingly grinning, laughing, and acting in a strange and unprofessional manner during a press conference aired by MSNBC is just one of the many instances highlighted as suspicious. Most shockingly though, are the reactions of the victims’ families.</p>

<p>Bereaved father Robbie Parker is all smiles only a day after daughter was gunned down...
The most famous being the alleged father of six-year-old victim Emilie Parker, Robbie Parker, whom when speaking to CNN the day after it was believed his daughter had been fatally shot, can be seen chuckling as he walks towards the camera but the switches into a hyperventilating and distressed character in order discuss a fundraising scheme in his daughter’s memory.
Also, presently there is a lawsuit, but the whereabouts of the man are unknown, and missing. the media conspired to brainwash the public into thinking a lone gunman drill known as the ‘Sandi H00k Mazzacre’ was real, when in fact it was a staged FEMA [Federal Emergency Management Agency] National Level Exercise Event.” Shanley pointed to two of the main documents he includes in his lawsuit. “One is the photo that was on the front page of all the newspapers, magazines and on every TV channel,” explained Shanley. “Everyone has seen this picture of a dozen or so children supposedly being evacuated from Sandi H00k School. The children are shown walking single file in a parking lot with their hands on each other’s shoulder while a policewoman is guiding them. Have you seen that picture? Everyone has seen that picture. But guess what? That picture was completely staged by Shannon Hick of The Newtown Bee. It wasn’t even taken on that day. You can tell that the children are not even wearing winter clothes and there is no frost on the ground as there was on December 14. Not a single child is wearing any winter clothes, not even one coat or jacket. That’s because the photo was taken either on November 12 or on October 17 during a drill conducted at Sandi H00k. Other panned out pictures of this photo-op event show that only these 10 to 15 kids are on the scene along with other bystanders. Where are the other 585 children?” Shanley said the other evidence he has is the video footage from the dash cams in the police cars that showed up at Sandi H00k School that morning. “The cameras have a running time stamp starting from 9:37 a.m. and running till 12:49 p.m. and show the entire school and parking lot, yet they show absolutely no evacuation activity taking place that morning, nor do they record purported evacuation activity at specific times as recorded in the official Sandi H00k report,” he said. “In at least 36 documented instances, the evacuation activity events reported on the official Sandi H00k report are not reflected in any of the three dash cams pointed at the specific direction of the school building cited in the report.” The iconic picture of the children being evacuated was allegedly taken at 10:16 a.m. on December 14, 2012. Once again, there is no such activity recorded by any of the three dash cams, which scoped the entire school and parking lot. Aerial video footage taken of the school grounds by news helicopters also do not show any evacuation activity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sandy Hook was crazy. One of the most blatant scams ever pulled. And it really only succeeded because the average person would never think that such a thing could be faked, or that the government (and whoever else was involved) would even try to pull off such a massive deception. So most don&#39;t even look into it, they dismiss it right away without a second thought. I admit, I was of this view until around 2015, when I watched the documentary We Need To Talk About Sandy Hook (which then prompted me to do even more research into it). That was one of my biggest world-shattering &quot;red pill&quot; moments. </p>
