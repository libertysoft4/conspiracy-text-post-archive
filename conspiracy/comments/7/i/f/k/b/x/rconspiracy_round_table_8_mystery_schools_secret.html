    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a profound connection between groups like this, the American Revolution, and even the Bavarian Illuminati (all had their origins in 1776).</p>

<p>In fact, the first state to declare Independence (Rhode Island I believe?) did so <em>days</em> after the Bavarian Illuminati was founded.</p>

<p>Also, the history of the Revolutionary War is woefully incomplete without studying Freemasonry.</p>

<p>The book <em>The Temple and the Lodge</em> by Baigent and Leigh reveals some fascinating tidbits about cooperation between Freemasons in <em>both</em> the British and American forces, especially the officers.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Yes. That&#39;s the best source I have found on the topic and it does a good job of showing how the masons were all working together under the assumption that the American Revolution was going to be a controlled blowing off of steam. It wasn&#39;t, however, because Washington and Franklin had planned out a real revolution decades in advance.</p>

<p>The Bavarian Illuminati was one of their projects. It was exposed because it was supposed to be exposed to create division, chaos, and confusion among the Freemasons in Europe.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Baigent and Leigh use sources which are known to be hoaxes and they treat them as accepted history. Basically they are clickbait whores.  </p>

<p>If you want well researched dope about high weirdness in early America this might be the book you want:  </p>

<p>Upstate Cauldron<br/>
Eccentric Spiritual Movements in Early New York State<br/>
Joscelyn Godwin  </p>

<p>To make a long story short after the Revolutionary War the new American government decided all the Indian tribes who had allied with the British had to vacate far west fast. This left lots of room for people to homestead. They thought the land they were colonizing was empty. It was empty of people but it was not really empty. Almost every single fringe religious movement of the 19th century (there were hundreds) traces back to this area roughly Albany to Buffalo.  </p>

<p>Did it ever occur to you that the angel who revealed himself to Joseph Smith was actually a pissed off Indian spirit who tricked the holy fuck out of him? Well that never occurred to me until I read Godwin&#39;s fantastic book. (I am not claiming that was what actually happened. But it never occurred to me that is what might have happened until I read this book.)</p>

Chapter 10 of <a href="https://archive.org/details/HowTheNationWasWonAmericasUntoldStory1630-1754">How the Nation was Won</a> explains how Franklin infiltrated the aristocratic and secret societies of Europe to buddy up to the elites.

    <div class="md"><p>And low, the Sage sitting under the great seething Oak whispered his first lesson to the masses. </p>

<p>I invoke the great power of the goddess of poetry. Speak in me muse, through my tongue speak. Tell of truths yet unknown, unveil the. 
And the words of the goddess rang through the sage. No longer a man. Now a vessel. </p>

<p>Gaze unto thy navel no more. Look up into the world. We have entered upon the last age of man. The Kali Yuga. The iron age. Nothing is sacred in the last age. The age of the material girl and the death of the goddess. The age where only material things have value. Our ancestors once held notions to the level of gods. Justice, Victory, Courage, Death, and Love, all gods. Or held the the level there of. Gods in the sense that they are above man. We no longer have any gods in this age. Just the false idol of the dollar. Apotheosis of the lowest cast. The money making merchant. Shunned are the true priests, the bards. Sunned are the courageous, the warrior the protector. Nothing is sacred under the rein of those who rule by usury. Not, divine right of victory.</p>

<p>Upon the mad presumption of Nietzsche, God hath died. Mad at the time but after the horrors of the last century we can see that in the abyss we are alone. He said that if you stare into the abyss of reality long enough the abyss will stare back into you. And that is why we are all gathered here in this sacred grove. We contemplate the death of god. The rotten body of god withered from the cross. Now a century on even the cross does rot. Buzzards pick at the glorious host. A communion of his flesh for the scavengers. Our western god has succumb to a Promethean sky burial. </p>

<p>What can be done you ask? </p>

<p>Rekindle the fires of your ancestors and they will tell you what must be done. Rekindle the fire within yourself. Become who you are.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A meaningful and complete contribution to this subject will be tricky and long and there will (always be) naysayers and detractors, so let&#39;s dive right on in: (hmm, where to begin...)</p>

<p>Let us take a look at the distribution of a <a href="http://www.ancient-origins.net/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/Genetic-Map-of-Haplogroup-X.jpg">little possessed DNA grouping, called Haplogroup X</a>. The Eastern Band of Cherokee have, for some time now, insisted upon Middle Eastern ancestry and though testing of THEIR people yielded low percentages, so did testing in the current middle east.</p>

<p>It is as if, someone was in the Middle East prior to everyone else who lives there and they came or moved to America and are now almost extinct... hmm... curious.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.native-languages.org/legends-giants.htm">What do their legends tell us of their origins then?</a>... hmm I see... 23 tribes, some of the largest ones - all insist upon giants inhabiting this land before them... well that&#39;s okay, <em>pre-historic man was stupid, yep they were dumbbbbb...they thought the enemy was a cool guy so they painted petroglyphs of them as 15 feet tall and eating all their people. Yup.. they were dumb..</em></p>

<p>Or and lets be honest here... do you really think pre-historic man knew nothing of truth or importance and everything he told us of his life was a lie?</p>

<p>So if we are WILLING to consider that there may be some veracity to these legends, let&#39;s look at the overall picture of what we find in America, to begin to build a case.</p>

<p>Well, the most prominent and common feature we find are <a href="https://tennesseearchaeologycouncil.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/mounds-map.jpg?w=680&amp;amp;h=485">hundreds and hundreds of burial mounds</a>. Yet some of these mounds are too large for just burials - in the case of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monks_Mound">Monk&#39;s Mound</a> the base of the structure is almost equal to the footprint of the Great Pyramid. In the case of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty_Point">Poverty Point</a> we find a city built atop/between/around the mound site. (As an interesting note, that we will get to later: some of these burial mounds show intense weathering and deposition of sea-based minerals and markers. Some are also in the middle of rivers, swamps, lakes - remembering of course two things:</p>

<p>1) Climate, geography and the shape of the land change over time
2) Pre-historic people were NOT stupid. (I always ask people &quot;Why build a sunken city... no one would do that in a time where very survival was your own responsibility... it SANK... people are SO brainwashed into non-rational thinking these days it&#39;s almost sickening.)</p>

<p>These geological changes seem to imply a different landscape at the time of their building. Now some can be explained as plains that became swamps a few hundred or thousand years ago, fine.</p>

<p>In the case of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lovelock_Cave#Duck_decoys">Lovelock Cave&#39;s Duck Decoys</a>, the last time the area had any meaningful body of water to fish from was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Lahontan">12,700 years ago</a>. Not to mention they were dug from a strata of soil dating between 10,000 to 15,000 years. </p>

<p>The Paiute natives of this area tell of their army chasing the last of the Giants into the cave, setting the entrance aflame and firing thousands of arrows into the cave. From the cave, beneath layers of bat guano were found burnt brush, many arrowheads and a strange donut shaped stone with 365 notches carved on the outside ring. Evidently an 8 foot 6 inch skeleton was found under the guano by the Paiutes but they buried it and refuse to reveal the location - because they claim the Giants are their ancestors!!!! Curiouser and curiouser. </p>

<p>The reason for the war was apparently that after having taught the Paiute and protected them, they began to devour them? (World wide claims hold that there may have been two races of giants: red haired, friendly ones and black haired cannibalistic ones.) In prolonged sun exposure, very dark hair can attain a ruddy, rust colour. Perhaps they mistook one for the other and paid for it in blood?</p>

<p>In an attempt to gain extra information from the Paiutes, one researcher was extorted for at least four figures, just to film <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyramid_Lake_(Nevada">Pyramid Lake</a>). The Pyramid Lake <a href="https://news.nationalgeographic.com/content/dam/news/photos/000/703/70378.jpg">petroglyphs</a> were determined to be between 10,000 and 15,000 years old.</p>

<p>Even the strict religion of science cannot fully accept the [Baring Strait Crossing Hypothesis](), saying and I quote: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;A Bering Strait crossing is a hypothetical bridge and/or tunnel spanning the relatively narrow and shallow Bering Strait&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To counter the scientific ineptitude of this theory, the <a href="https://www.inverse.com/article/38057-first-americans-kelp-highway-hypothesis">Kelp Crossing Hypothesis</a> has been suggested. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;In the Perspective, Erlandson and his colleagues argue that early Americans followed Pacific Rim shorelines from northern Asia to Beringia to the Americas, then continued to migrate through the Americas along the coasts — not through the ice-free corridor that the Clovis-first theory suggests.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you return to the map of the mounds, however and the distribution of Haplogroup X. <strong>The conspiracy is: the wrong sea-board and the wrong people at the wrong time!</strong></p>

<p>Though my explaination has been MUCH simplified (I could write DAYS worth of the evidence I have discovered and how it all webs together to support this, but no one wants that.) I believe the GENERAL idea is becoming clear.</p>

<p>A respected red-haired race of stature, ORIGINALLY From the middle-east and nearly completely unrelated to those who live there now... who lived BEFORE AND AFTER a world-wide flood, hm... where have I heard that before...?</p>

<p>I hope you enjoyed my (again) <strong>GROSSLY OVER-SIMPLIFIED</strong> (due to time and space and attention constraints) explaination of why I love the topic of Ancient America.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a passage apocrypha, 2 Esdras 13:40-47 that many believe refers to the lost tribes crossing the Bering Strait into North America:</p>

<p>&quot;these are the ten tribes that were taken captive from their land in the days of King Hoshea, whom King Shalmaneser of the Assyrians took across the river as a captive. They were taken into another land, but they made this plan for themselves: They would leave the multitude of the nations and go into a more remote region, where the human race had never lived. There they would be able to observe their customs, which they hadn’t kept in their own region. They went in through the narrow passages of the Euphrates River. Then the Most High gave them signs and stopped the flow of the river until they had passed.  They made a long journey through that region for a year and a half, and that region is called Arzareth.  They lived there until the last time, and now they begin again to return. The Most High will once again stop the flow of the river so that they can cross.&quot;</p>

<p>Legends say this was one of the sources that led Columbus to look for the New World.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For some reason this makes me think of the Book of Mormon. Very interesting considering Joseph Smith&#39;s alleged ties to freemasonry.</p>

<p>&quot;The books from First Nephi to Omni are described as being from &quot;the small plates of Nephi&quot;.[51] This account begins in ancient Jerusalem around 600 BC. It tells the story of a man named Lehi, his family, and several others as they are led by God from Jerusalem shortly before the fall of that city to the Babylonians in 586 BC. The book describes their journey across the Arabian peninsula, and then to the promised land, the Americas, by ship.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Mormon">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Mormon</a></p>

<p>When Mosiah 1 discovered a people who had left Jerusalem with mulek, a son of Zedekiah (see Jer. 52:10; Omni 1:12-15; Hel. 8:21), and King Limhi&#39;s messengers found a record of the extinct jaredites, the Nephites learned that they were not the only people God had brought to the Western Hemisphere.</p>

<p><a href="http://eom.byu.edu/index.php/Book_of_Mormon#First_Book_of_Nephi">http://eom.byu.edu/index.php/Book_of_Mormon#First_Book_of_Nephi</a></p>

<p>According to the Book of Mormon, the people fled across the ocean on unique barges and established an ancient civilization in the Americas. The book of Ether&#39;s mention of &quot;elephants&quot; and &quot;narrow neck of land&quot; has led some to conclude that this civilization likely spanned from the Midwest to eastern states such as New York, where not only fossils of ancient mammoths have been discovered in abundance, but in many Native American accounts describe Niagara as the narrow strip of land which literally translates to &quot;the neck&quot; [reference?]</p>

<p>Indeed, there may be genetic relationships between the Canaanites and the Native Americans, extending back thousands and thousands of years, but we don&#39;t have gigantic or titanic human ancestors that were 8th ft tall. </p>

<p>Case in point: the Greek &quot;Giant&quot; is likely from the same root that gives us Gaia. It has nothing to do with physical proportions. The Greeks lied to us about everything that came before them during the &quot;Golden Age of Kronos.&quot;. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>In the eyes of a historian, the Paiutes annihilated a rival tribe and mythologized them into fearsome, cannibalistic giants.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You are assuming that a certain claim is proven and shared by others, when that isn&#39;t the case. Specifically, you believe that most ancient stories about phenomena that are not currently observable were fabrications.</p>

<p>There are several examples I can give you that prove that this approach of scoffing at ancient stories has done history a terrible disservice. The most obvious example is the assumption that stories about an ancient flood (coming from hundreds of different cultures) were made up. </p>

<p>Recent evidence has shown that there really was a worldwide cataclysm after a comet impact roughly 12000 years ago, and this includes 1000 foot-tall tsunamis and extensive flooding.</p>

<p>Another example is the dismissal of stories that the Egyptian pyramids were tens of thousands of years old. It was long assumed that the Egyptian pyramids were built by Khufu about 4500 years ago. As real scientific investigation has been done, it has become clear that the pyramids are much, much older, as evidenced by water erosion on the surface.</p>

<p>In other words, it&#39;s not a good idea to assume that all of these stories are myths, rather than legends or in some cases being fairly accurate depictions.</p>

<p>Overall I enjoyed your post, but your quote and link about the Bering Sea Crossing is about a hypothetical modern bridge and tunnel that is currently under consideration, not about the possibility of ancient people crossing the Bering Strait to enter the Americas.

    <div class="md"><p>I like to keep my mind open to everything but thats a lot to wrap your head around. That being said, your red haired and black haired giants theory intrigues me.</p>

<p>Since it&#39;s semi relevant, have you ever looked into the &quot;lore&quot; behind the book of Mormon?  The book was supposedly translated in a John Dee fashion by treasure Hunter and Freemason Joseph smith in the early 1800s. The book is a history of ancient americans who came from Israel and colonised Central America (debatable). The original ancestor of these people, Nephi, is always described as &quot;large in stature&quot;, and his bloodline eventually is whiped out by another tribe.</p>

<p>Obviously, a lot of the book has been debunked by anyone not brainwashed by the current church authorities (see precolumbian horses/wheat/steel). But maybe Smith was on to something? It&#39;s not far fetched to believe he was into the occult, so it could be possible. He was also obsessed with ancient egypt, and tried to translate some burial scrolls but failed miserably according to modern interpretations.</p>

<p>Michael Tsarion and other discuss at length these giants/fomorians and who they are and where they come from.  I&#39;m trying to remember an excellent book written in the early 1900&#39;s by an old English author, I have it somewhere in my house.  He discusses what he believes to have happened in the English isles and around it and the peoples who lived and fought there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Anyone know the obsession with death and rebirth in freemasonry or other societies? Is this something an initiate must undergo, at a certain degree? Something where you are physically put to sleep and awaken after 3 days, or something along these lines?</p>

<p>If the great pyramids were not actually just burial chambers for kings, but actually temples for initiation, I can understand why there are constant mentions of tombs. Initiates were put to sleep and &quot;reborn&quot; upon awakening. </p>

<p>I listen to a lot of rap music, especially the older stuff (90s to mid 2000s), and as a genre rap is very anti-occult and anti-secret society. Constant subtle mentions of occult beliefs and worship. The thing is you have to know those beliefs beforehand to catch on. They always seem to mention sleep, usually claiming they never sleep. They usually reference the classic nas line of &quot;I never sleep, cause sleep is the cousin of death&quot;. I&#39;ve heard this numerous times. Jadakiss and styles P on the track &quot;banned from TV&quot;. Cam&#39;ron has the verse before these two where he says &quot;Rich faces, sick places. See my story is 6 thousand, 6 hundred and 66 pages&quot;. Then jadakiss and styles P have lines shortly after saying &quot;do they dance with the devil when they sleep?&quot;, as well as &quot;it&#39;s the shit that they kick in your ear, when your soul drift in the air&quot;. There are many more.</p>

<p>Any ideas?</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>rap is very anti-occult and anti-secret society. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Going to have to disagree with you on this one, especially regarding rappers today.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a rapper named Xxxtentacion, who came up with a rapper named Ski Mask the Slump God. They had issues with each other, and Ski Mask claims that X said that Ski was &quot;supposed to be sacrificed&quot;. A pornstar friend of theirs (not a very reliable source, I know) said that X &quot;sacrificed X&#39;s soul&quot;.</p>

<p>Then you have Lil Uzi Vert who is constantly playing off occult themes. Although I think this is a stretch, people have pointed out how much his name sounds like Lucifer. On his recent album (and really first major release) Luv is Rage 2 he has a song called 444+222. <a href="https://images.complex.com/complex/images/c_limit,w_606/fl_lossy,pg_1,q_auto/vf6phvcqcnvocvjclxqq/lil-uzi-vert-luv-is-rage-2-cover">This</a> is the default cover for the album, but he also released the version <a href="http://images-eds.xboxlive.com/image?url=wHwbXKif8cus8csoZ03RW8ke8ralOdP9BGd4wzwl0MJ9z6QzuGwZjtvbE7sSsMVWhmDcoR9EfZ6XIHrE8knGZXmFLs1.fPIqYBrUA5TZWzFslPN.gBKGp87.7yAyUkuKOVDPhlvk3uXeK8LGgbGvDpqCRmCByH7g3XmR5.Oy97E-&amp;amp;format=png">without the Off White tape on it.</a> You can see all sorts of symbolic imagery that was previously covered, such as a goat head, a snake intertwined in arrows, and a halo above his bear backpack. Furthermore, he&#39;s shown depicted with bat wings on the corners. This isn&#39;t the extent of Lil Uzi&#39;s use of occult symbolism, but rather just a look at the uses of it on this album. </p>

<p>Another example is the rapper Z-Ro who recently retired. His final album called &quot;No Love Boulevard&quot; has a song called &quot;Devil In Me&quot;. Here are some relevant excerpts. </p>

<pre><code>If I woulda signed that contract, I&#39;d be richer than rich
But when they say die, I&#39;d have to die face down in that ditch
(Everybody wanna try, to bring out the devil in me
What keeps my soul at ease, is G-O-D)
If I attended that ceremony, I&#39;d be better off
Find myself a celebrity, but I&#39;d be forever lost
(Everybody wanna try, to bring out the devil in me
What keeps my soul at ease, is G-O-D)

What good is it for me, to gain the world but yet lose my soul
I woulda been a millionaire, since 20 years old
I wouldn&#39;t have had to pay, for all of these diamonds and gold
Just sacrifice one of my people, I ain&#39;t really know
</code></pre>

<p>There&#39;s a lot more to take from <a href="http://www.lyricsg.com/352004/z-ro/devil-in-me-lyrics">these lyrics</a>, but these few excerpts show him referencing shady record deals with something more to them.</p>

<p>Finally, my last example will just be a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6u76yh/there_may_be_proof_that_coach_k_founder_of/">link to a post</a> I&#39;ve made in the past which shows what I believe to be (alleged) use of blackmail in the music industry (although could be explained as just some odd sexual thing). </p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t say any of these examples prove that rappers are involved in this type of thing, but it at the very least shows how often it is that rappers like to reference it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly, that&#39;s a really close minded view of hip hop and not one I&#39;d expect from someone who is (seemingly) open minded enough to discuss conspiracies.</p>

<p>There are lots of great new school rappers, and you can say J. Cole and Kendrick have sold out just as much as any other rapper (J. Cole did the whole typical label shit with his first album, Kendrick is reselling his album as a &quot;collector&#39;s edition&quot; with the only difference being the track list is in reverse). </p>

<p>Furthermore, calling anything &quot;mumble rap&quot; is just an excuse to be ignorant. Plenty of so called &quot;mumble rappers&quot; are perfectly understandable, and even if you couldn&#39;t understand them that would still be stupid to discount them because of it (do you think all music in languages you don&#39;t understand is stupid?). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>j cole has comoletely sold out. he admitted it. he did it under jay z who was his connection. he turned on the lights on for him, allowing him to run his own Roc Nation label, which has a lot of popular artists. but as he said &quot;you have to play the game, to change the game.&quot; he did it for a good cause.</p>

<p>ok if you can clearly understand those songs, listen to jay z on Do It Again from his vol. 3 album and try to keep up and tell me what rapping is now, compared to what it originally was. in terms of the skills required to be the best in the game as jay z is. they call themselves rappers, but theyre not doing the music the gangster rappers did. like how theres classic rock, and grunge rock. theres gangster rap which is anti occult. and theres mumble rap to dumb down society probably as a plan developed during the recent commercialization of rap by the nwo, to destroy the rap industry.  </p>

<p>heres his song released in 1999 called &quot;New World&quot;, off the album Nastradmus. he predicts what the world will be like heading forward into the year 2000 and beyond. one of the many many many things he predicts is &quot;the rich get tickets to visit mars, while the poor people starve.&quot; </p>

<p>elon musk and boeing in 2017 have just announced theyre racing to mars. elon musk owns telsa, and rich people buy his cars. so these rich people might also buy his tickets to visit mars, if he decides to sell this type of transportation. and theres a lot of poor people and probably will be for a long time coming</p>

<p>i think if there more people like him everywhere the world might be a better place. havent you heard what the world would be like if he ruled it? doesnt sound too bad </p>

I&#39;ve read a theory about the pyramids being used as devices that could project the consciousness of an individual out into the universe/to another planet. Couple this with the records of supposed ancient pharaohs who ruled for tens of thousands of years... What if Egyptian rulers were projecting consciousness of themselves at death into the mind of their heir at their inheritance of the throne? That&#39;d effectively have an &quot;individual&quot; ruling for hundreds of years. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>Most of the mystery religions teach some variation of the dying and resurrecting god. These tend to center around explaining the seasons (Persephone) or fertility magic (Baal), but the deity is generally brought back by some kind of sexual act.</p>

<p>While the details may be similar, the explanation of the story in the Bible is dissimilar. The sacrifices in the Torah are done to atone for moral guilt of humans. In the New Testament, the god dies as an atonement for all of humanity, the &quot;Lamb of God,&quot; with God not sparing his own son as he spared Abraham&#39;s son.</p>

<p>&quot; Despite its claims about not issuing policy statements or lobbying, CNP appears to wage considerable influence on elected officials. A sign of its influential role is the effort high profile politicians put into wooing the group, as noted above with respect to the 2016 Republican presidential nomination contest. Previously, during the 2008 presidential campaign, several Republican Party candidates addressed CNP, including Mitt Romney, Fred Thompson, and Sen. John McCain (R-AZ)...</p>

<p>A McCain campaign advisor lauded the CNP, saying: &quot;<em>This is the most distinguished collection of conservative leaders and donors</em>, and [the senator] was anxious to appear as part of his ongoing effort to consolidate support for his candidacy within the conservative movement.&quot;&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I added the link to show it is a bipartisan group.  The bit about the liberal media largely focused on Republican sex scandals is my criticism that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_F3nDIdHcnE">they don&#39;t cover this group outside of Republican sex scandals.</a>  If you search the group online, the majority of mainstream news articles laud the group, except when covering Republican sex scandals (a favorite topic for some reason). </p>

<p>I personally wish corporate media would report more on the bipartisan militant actions the group is tied to, <a href="http://www.talk2action.org/story/2012/4/4/8029/40080/">like Kony 2012</a> </p>

<p>But the corporate media supports shit like militarizing dictators when both parties agree, or any military action really. It is something Democrats, Republicans, and the corporate sponsored media agree on, so the news of ties to dictators, genocides, civil wars, coups, drugs, and more &quot;shadowy&quot; activities... does not get wide coverage.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The idea of mystery schools that existed on different parts of the globe and taught human beings so called inner and outer knowledge in the form of initiation traditions is very interesting.  Here are some things that come to mind and that all have to do with the topic of mystery schools and the development of one&#39;s deeper aspects through them.    </p>

<p>This has always been an interesting video to check out regarding Freemasonry and mystery schools.  The man speaking is one of the past grand commanders of the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry.  It is interesting about how he goes into the idea that we have untapped powers sleeping within us and that these ancient mystery schools helped the individual bring forth these faculties through their own inner development:

<p>This here is a neat video with a man named Elmer Green and he was a scientist who was working with people in training them how to control autonomic functions of the body with their minds and their imagination, and he also tested several yogis of India with scientific equipment he designed with the help of the team he had:

<p>Also... anyone here know about Franz Bardon ?  He was a Czech occultist with an interesting background and story.<br/>
A bit of a biography of the man that was written in part by his secretary.  Some say it is not an accurate depiction of the man due to embellishments by the secretary, but the story is interesting and touches on the idea of secret societies with members who have extensively developed mental abilities and use them for either &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot; depending on their own natures:

    <div class="md"><p>One interesting thing I&#39;ll add quickly is that I was researching an obscure-ish international religious NGO because I thought it seemed scammy, for a few months... going through their own publications and researching things I found there.  </p>

<p>The research starting becoming more than a a mere &quot;scam&quot; as I was noticing many links to the military industrial complex, political institutions, banks, oil companies, etc.  </p>

<p>Then I found Jeff Sharlet&#39;s book and there were so many of the same connections I had independently made via different research and documents.  It was pretty surreal.  The NGO I was researching is but just one organization in &quot;The Family.&quot;  I will write about that unnamed NGO sometime in the not too near future.</p>

<p>As far as &quot;traditional conspiracy theories&quot; go, the closest I can think of is &quot;The Octopus&quot; conspiracy theory that an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danny_Casolaro">independent researcher was writing a book about when he &quot;died mysteriously.&quot;</a>.  I say this because when I first read about the Octopus in some articles online, I was well aware of everything they mentioned because of my own independent research.  That and some crazy Wayne Madsen articles about the group creep me out, as an &quot;independent researcher.&quot;  </p>

<p>As far as traditional </p>
