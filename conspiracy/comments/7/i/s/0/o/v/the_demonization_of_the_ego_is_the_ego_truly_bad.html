<p>I am sure you may have heard about Jim Carrey and his “bizarre” interview:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STRyHD8eWIo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STRyHD8eWIo</a></p>

<p>As he is wearing his expensive suit, he says there is no meaning to anything, mocking those at the celebrity event he is at (does anybody else find this ironic?)</p>

<p>Many are proclaiming he is enlightened and he has found the ultimate truth, but I feel he is deceiving many. </p>

<p>Look, maybe there is SOME truth to what he is saying, but that’s the problem. There may be some truth, but it is not the FULL truth. I mean, how can he be true when he is participating in this event, wearing his expensive suit? If he wanted to drop his ego, he’d drop his fame altogether.</p>

<p>In another video, an ex-KBG agent explains how eastern religions were purposefully introduced to the west, essentially to make people more self-absorbed - to make them not want to change society or take action. You can find this at about 50 minutes. It is really good:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5It1zarINv0&amp;amp;t=3138sI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5It1zarINv0&amp;amp;t=3138sI</a></p>

<p>I find it interesting that many celebrities claim to be Buddhist, like Richard Gere:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.lionsroar.com/richard-gere-my-journey-as-a-buddhist/">https://www.lionsroar.com/richard-gere-my-journey-as-a-buddhist/</a></p>

<p>Look at his house though:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=richard+gere+house&amp;amp;source=lnms&amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwja_8GV4f3XAhUq7oMKHaa2DXYQ_AUICygC&amp;amp;biw=1366&amp;amp;bih=652">https://www.google.com/search?q=richard+gere+house&amp;amp;source=lnms&amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwja_8GV4f3XAhUq7oMKHaa2DXYQ_AUICygC&amp;amp;biw=1366&amp;amp;bih=652</a></p>

<p>He sure is doing good on that “non-attachment” principle, isn’t he? 😊</p>

<p>Look, I get we are all flawed, but the point is I am finding something very suspicious about the promotion of egolessness in western society. I would like to explore that in this post. This is not a criticism of those who may follow these practices; rather it is a criticism of hypocricy.  Finally, while there may be truth in these practices, I would like to argue they are not the whole truth.
There is a deeper truth, and the conspiracy is &#39;they&#39; are deceiving us.</p>

<p><strong>Nihilism in Disguise</strong></p>

<p>Every day, in some way shape or form, we are told our lives do not matter. I mean, even researchers claim that “YOLO” is sound life advice:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/02/28/researchers-confirm-that-yolo-is-sound-life-advice/">https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/02/28/researchers-confirm-that-yolo-is-sound-life-advice/</a></p>

<p>The problem with YOLO and modern culture itself, is that there is a possibility that we may live after death. What people are starting to believe is that ONLY this material world matters, and only this life matters. </p>

<p>Before I get too philosophical, I always look to modern television and pop culture, as they are a reflection of values in general society.</p>

<p>In this Rick and Morty clip, the claim is that life is essentially meaningless:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_qvy82U4RE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_qvy82U4RE</a></p>

<p>Even George Carlin claims that one should not “give a shit”:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZGo6mWjk4Y&amp;amp;t=1s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZGo6mWjk4Y&amp;amp;t=1s</a></p>

<p>We are told that nothing really matters, but is that true?</p>

<p>At the same time, we are being fed new age religions that preach the same thing.  Deepak Chopra, a regular on Oprah, seems to preach this belief:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVX43q6jj08">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVX43q6jj08</a></p>

<p>He says, “There is no death, and there is no birth.” He claims there is only some sort of continuum. </p>

<p>Maybe he’s right, but what if he is not? What he is saying is life and death are essentially not important, if we are simply on a continuum of existence.</p>

<p>Whatever is true, let’s go back to the original point of this post. There seems to be this demonization of the ego. Here, for example, are five steps to get rid of the ego by Huffington Post:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/fani-stipkovic/how-to-drop-your-ego-with_b_9263250.html">https://www.huffingtonpost.com/fani-stipkovic/how-to-drop-your-ego-with_b_9263250.html</a></p>

<p>The question is, though, is the ego really &quot;evil&quot; and does your life have meaning?</p>

<p><strong>Selfishness</strong></p>

<p>Buddhism (and other religions) explain that we should not worry about problems of the world (they are all an illusion), and we should look into ourselves for answers. Essentially nothing matters because ultimately everything goes in cycles, and good can be bad and bad can be good. Essentially, the ONLY way to escape in enlightenment. This is MY interpretation of Buddhism, and I’m willing to argue my points. </p>

<p>I think there is truth here, but I also think that there is a problem here. When we are ONLY reflecting our on ourselves, and nothing else, we seem to miss our connections with the world.</p>

<p>Is it possible that beliefs like this can increase our narcissism?</p>

<p>This is very telling:</p>

<p>“Then there is the claim that contemplative practice will make us gentler, more humble and compassionate. In Zen and the Brain (MIT Press, 1998), the neurologist and Buddhist James Austin proposes that meditation and mindfulness erode neural regions underpinning our innate self-centeredness. But given the repulsive behavior over the past few decades of so many gurus—including Chogyam Trungpa, who was an alcoholic womanizer and bully—you could conclude that mystical knowledge leads to pathological narcissism rather than selflessness. Instead of shrinking to a point and vanishing, the mystic&#39;s ego may expand to infinity. Did Buddhism deflate the ego of Steve Job?”</p>

<p><a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/cross-check/why-i-dont-dig-buddhism/">https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/cross-check/why-i-dont-dig-buddhism/</a></p>

<p>What I feel is that people can sit there, ridding their ego all day long, but that does not stop the problems of the world. I feel that Buddhism (and similar beliefs) increase the belief that one should take no action and just accept things as they are. </p>

<p>When looking only at ourselves, I feel we may be trapped by selfishness ultimately. There are DEFINITELY benefits to meditation and mindfulness, and I am not dismissing that, but like any other belief system, hypocricy emerges.</p>

<p><strong>Is the ego bad?</strong></p>

<p>When I was really immersed in Buddhism, I saw the ego as inherently bad. It is something I wanted to get rid of – I meditated and focused on non-attachment principles. While the meditation brought me some good, it also brought me some emptiness. I was so focused on myself that the world around me blurred. While there are truths in Buddhism, I ultimately feel I was misled. I feel that trying to get rid of the ego by focusing on the ego through meditation is a complete contradiction. </p>

<p>While I am not trying to bash any religion, I have since come to the conclusion that the ego is a tool – nothing more. Like technology, it can be used for good or bad. It is a reflection of our thoughts, our feelings, our soul. Our ego is a vessel to show the world who we really are – or it is a tool to deceive others and bring bad in the world.</p>

<p>In my mind, the ego does NOT have to be our enemy. Having an awareness of our ego is great, but unfortunately, many people do not have that awareness.</p>

<p>As mentioned earlier, we are seeing the rise of narcissism in our world. Most of us have seen the connection between the rise of narcissism and social media. Social media helps us be focused only on ourselves and our individual lives:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/compassion-matters/201211/is-social-media-blame-the-rise-in-narcissism">https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/compassion-matters/201211/is-social-media-blame-the-rise-in-narcissism</a></p>

<p>From the article, “The trouble with this aspect of social networking is that nearly everyone presents an unrealistic portrait of themselves.”</p>

<p>Clearly, the problem with social media is that we can easily lie to ourselves and to others. While some have balance and control over social media, many do not:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thecut.com/2014/02/addicted-to-likes-social-media-makes-us-needier.html">https://www.thecut.com/2014/02/addicted-to-likes-social-media-makes-us-needier.html</a></p>

<p>The problem with our world today is that, in some ways, I feel people want to be worshipped. Maybe less believe in God, but many certainly may feel like Gods with their audiences on Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook. This is when the ego gets people into trouble.</p>

<p>There are, of course, many other negative uses of the ego, from celebrities who feed off the worship of followers, to corrupt politicians and leaders in the world who manipulate the masses.</p>

<p>In some ways, the ego can absolutely be used for bad, but it is only a tool, an expression of something deeper in ourselves. If our thoughts, for example, are evil, then our egos will be a reflection of that.</p>

<p><strong>Can the ego be used for good?</strong></p>

<p>Though this is a Huffington Post article, it explores some of the ways that the ego can be used for good:</p>

<p>The author writes, “Ego (not be confused with arrogance) is life, passion, excitement, growth, drive, creativity, individuality, unique personality and reason. </p>

<p>Saying ego is bad is as preposterous as stating water is bad, because it can drown you or fire is bad, because it can burn you. Ego, water and fire are all life sustaining, and they only bite if they are misused.”</p>

<p>As I mentioned earlier, ego may NOT be who we are, but it is a reflection of who we are truly. If we have an essence of goodness, I feel it will come out in our egos in different ways, from art to creativity to expression to love to kindness. </p>

<p>Self-reflection is important, of course, but it is a lost art. Could that be why narcissism is on the rise? Have people lost the ability to reflect on their egos?</p>

<p><a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/understand-other-people/201609/the-lost-art-self-reflection">https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/understand-other-people/201609/the-lost-art-self-reflection</a></p>

<p>From the article, “It’s quite unpopular today to engage in healthy self-reflection, or to put it in another way, “What’s my role in my problems and how could I address things differently for different results?”</p>

<p>The problem may not lie in the ego; rather, people are losing the ability to think about themselves in a balanced light. In our society, people either view themselves as Gods, or they embrace self-deprecation. There has to be a balance.</p>

<p><strong>Nihilism and Existentialism</strong></p>

<p>Nihilism and existentialism are on the rise (though they are nothing new):</p>

<p><a href="https://thesecularjurist.wordpress.com/2015/08/10/dystopia-and-the-rise-of-nihilism/">https://thesecularjurist.wordpress.com/2015/08/10/dystopia-and-the-rise-of-nihilism/</a></p>

<p>While existentialism is NOT nihilism, they have much in common.
When people believe there is nothing but themselves and this materialism world, their lives lose meaning. The only thing that becomes important is the ego because people think that is all they have.</p>

<p>If there is nothing, then all we have is this short, meaningless existence, which leads people to worry about materialism and pleasure – not meaning.</p>

<p>Further, Martin Luther King Jr. said, “Science keeps religion from sinking into the valley of crippling irrationalism and paralyzing obscurantism. Religion prevents science from falling into the marsh of obsolete materialism and moral nihilism.&quot; This brings me to my next point.</p>

<p><strong>Rise of Scientism</strong></p>

<p>In the quest for meaning, people have looked to science. Scientists have become the high priests of society that seems to have no meaning.</p>

<p>It is important to distinguish between science and scientism:</p>

<p>“Science is good but scientism isn’t. Science looks at the cosmos objectively, indeed scientifically. Scientism doesn’t.”</p>

<p>Moreover,, “Scientism is a dogmatic ideology which presumes that “science,” in the narrower sense of the word, has the answers to all questions. For believers in scientism the claims of metaphysics are invalid and have no bearing on reality. The physical cosmos is all there is. There is nothing but three dimensions (or four if we include time as a dimension) which are perceived with our five senses. This is all there is and this is therefore all that is worth studying.”</p>

<p><a href="http://www.intellectualtakeout.org/blog/science-versus-scientism">http://www.intellectualtakeout.org/blog/science-versus-scientism</a></p>

<p>The problem with scientism is the assumption that “I know everything,” and to me, that is where the ego comes in.</p>

<p>When we get to the point where we feel we have the answers to all questions, and there is nothing else to explore, life loses meaning. Our egos become inflated, and in fact, our ego may fear anything that goes against this type of dogma. As we all probably are aware, a nihilist can be as dogmatic as a religious person. </p>

<p>People become trapped in their own egos, in a way. As a teacher, I deeply value education – not indoctrination, and I’m not always sure people are the aware of the difference. </p>

<p>I feel that like scientism, pseudo-intellectualism can also overly inflate the ego.  In other words, the pseudo intellectual becomes more obsessed with status, not knowledge. This is another act of the ego. A person may feel that their knowledge can make them superior to others. To maintain the superiority, they must believe they know everything.</p>

<p>Still, there are mysteries in the universe, and I keep my mind open to the endless possibilities. Maybe there is nothing, but what if there is something?</p>

<p><strong>Diminishing the Ego</strong></p>

<p>While the ego can be used for good, I do agree with most spiritual leaders that it is important to diminish the ego because it can give rise to negative things. With that being said, I do not think one should obsess about getting rid of the ego through emphasis on the ego. Rather, I believe we should diminish our ego through acts of service to others.</p>

<p>Serving others helps us see that there are other egos, other souls, other people. If we are only living our lives for our selves, it loses meaning. I ask this question a lot because it makes so much sense to me: Would life have any meaning if you were the only one who existed?</p>

<p>It’s no secret that money, fame, status, and power are all fleeting – we have been told this by spiritual leaders for centuries. 
Study after study after study has shown that helping others makes us feel good and brings meaning into our lives:</p>

<p><a href="http://time.com/collection/guide-to-happiness/4070299/secret-to-happiness/">http://time.com/collection/guide-to-happiness/4070299/secret-to-happiness/</a></p>

<p>From the article, “There is a Chinese saying that goes: “If you want happiness for an hour, take a nap. If you want happiness for a day, go fishing. If you want happiness for a year, inherit a fortune. If you want happiness for a lifetime, help somebody.” For centuries, the greatest thinkers have suggested the same thing: Happiness is found in helping others.</p>

<p>Helping others humbles us, and humility is a trait in our society that is often overlooked, especially in this narcissistic age. Even those who set out to help others may feel compelled to post about it on social media for likes, feeding the ego again and again.</p>

<p>If we want to stop feeding our egos, we need to start worrying about others around us. This does not mean that we should be trampled on or abused by others; rather, if there is an opportunity to help others, we should do it.</p>

<p>Remember, we may be under the illusion that we must be rich or powerful to help others, but that is simply not the case. To help somebody else, you simply need to think of somebody first.</p>

<p>I remember one time I was waitressing, and it was a terrible, terrible shift. People were treating me like crap (they were likely frustrated), and I was actually crying as I was waiting on tables (trying to hide it). I worked in a shitty restaurant. People rarely tipped (poor area), and the other workers often did not show up, or just did not want to do their job. I was swamped with tables and had no help.</p>

<p>As I waited on one last table, I counted my tips, only to have 5 dollars after waiting on twenty tables or so. I needed money to pay my bills, and tears filled my eyes as I asked that last table for their drink orders.</p>

<p>I felt bad, as I obviously made them uncomfortable. </p>

<p>When they left, I saw a 5 dollar bill folded into a dove, and my heart warmed. 5 dollars may not seem like a lot to most, but it is/was a big tip where I live. It reminded me that some people do have kindness in their hearts.</p>

<p>As I reflect on my life, those are the moments I remember – the times people were kind to me, even when they did not have to be. I try to give back to the world with kindness, too.</p>

<p>The little acts are what count, truly. Again, they want us to believe that only the rich or powerful can change the world, but that is a lie:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.express.co.uk/life-style/life/852324/bernadette-russell-random-acts-kindness-change-the-world-inspiring">https://www.express.co.uk/life-style/life/852324/bernadette-russell-random-acts-kindness-change-the-world-inspiring</a></p>

<p>We can all change the world, but they do not want us to believe that.</p>

<p><strong>The Conspiracy</strong></p>

<p>So what is the conspiracy? I feel there are a few here.</p>

<p>1)  Going back to the original video by the ex-KGB agent, I feel that spiritual practices that focus on the self were purposely introduced to the west. The ex-KGB agent said to “meditate is to isolate oneself from the current social and political issues of your own country.” In an already individualistic society, meditation may not be the answer (as opposed to more group-oriented societies where meditation originated). In other words, focus on the self may not be the answer.</p>

<p>2)  They want you to believe life has no meaning. If people are nihilistic, then they seek consumerism, pleasure, and anything to fulfill the emptiness of life. What if there is something more? </p>

<p>Ask yourself, what is promoted in modern culture? Do television shows and music videos (and other sources of entertainment) promote finding meaning and fullness in life, or something else? Isn’t it odd that nearly every theme in pop culture (mostly consumed by children and teens) is about sex, drugs, making money, and the meaningless of life? </p>

<p>The slang “YOLO” if a reflection of what people believe. They believe we live once, so we must make the most by consuming and not wasting a moment. What if, though, there is something beyond death?</p>

<p>3)  They want you to believe YOU are meaningless and do not have power. They want you to believe that you can do nothing to help the world. They want you to believe that your life does not matter, and that you are nothing more than a “human resource.” </p>

<p>“You can be the most beautiful person in the world and 
everybody sees light and rainbows when they look at you, but if you yourself don&#39;t know it, all of that doesn&#39;t even matter. Every second that you spend on doubting your worth, every moment that you use to criticize yourself; is a second of your life wasted, is a moment of your life thrown away. It&#39;s not like you have forever, so don&#39;t waste any of your seconds, don&#39;t throw even one of your moments away.” ― C. JoyBell C.</p>

<p>They want you to believe that YOU are not good enough. They constantly advertise products that feed the emptiness of your ego that you are trying to fill constantly. If only you can be richer, more powerful, more beautiful, then maybe, just maybe your ego will be filled.</p>

<p>I am going to tell you right now that your ego will never be filled that way, and that is the ultimate conspiracy. The only way to fill your ego is to do good for the world, to help others, to express your creative side. If we are ultimately, truly a product of creation, then we should emulate the beauty of creation. Degradation is, ultimately, the opposite of creation. </p>

<p>When we seek fame, fortune, power, and other things, we in some ways degrade ourselves because we are telling ourselves we are not good enough, and we need something to &quot;fill&quot; us up. But, when we reach out and help others, express ourselves through art or music or love or whatever, we are creating joy in the world. We are emulating our creator.</p>

<p>Art, along with all work is the ordering of creation toward the intention of the creator. – Michael Gungor</p>

<p>To me, kindness is an art form, an ultimate expression of God. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We are taught that ego is bad (&quot;he has such a big ego,&quot; etc.) but I think it&#39;s more about what you attach your ego to. Attach it to the things that really matter with pure intentions and it&#39;s a great thing. Attach it to small, petty things and that&#39;s when it becomes distasteful.</p>

<p>Great post, btw. I have been thinking along similar lines. Ego in one is a threat to ego in others so it makes sense that there would be a conspiracy to suppress ego at large-scale.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One more thought as if 8 pages isn&#39;t enough...</p>

<p>I think that we all need pride and qualities like that to feel a sense of self-worth.</p>

<p>Think about little kids. They might need such aspects of ego to grow and learn.</p>

<p>When we say that we should have no ego at all, I feel that can breed of a feeling of worthlessnes.</p>

<p>I like photography, and when somebody tells me they like a photo I take, I feel a sense of pride and there is nothing wrong with that.</p>

<p>But...if I become obsessed with that pride, then there is the problem.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Personally I don&#39;t think everyone means the same thing when they say &quot;ego&quot;. Might be part of the confusion. Words are tricky, if you don&#39;t say exactly what you mean everything is up to interpretation. So when you or anyone say &#39;ego&#39;, I don&#39;t really know what you mean until you define it first.</p>

<p>Obviously ego has a definition in the dictionary but in my experience its one of those words that people have way different understandings of.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great post, as always. I&#39;m quite drunk at this point, so bear with me if some of my points are repetitions from past comments on your posts.</p>

<p>I agree with your Thesis on the Ego. As I have said before...if we are truly nothing but star dust, then what really matters is each other, our human brothers and sisters who we are blessed to live and experience this tiny fraction of our 13.8 billion year old cosmos with. As you said- to live for one another is to be fulfilled. To live for our children, and humanities children, to build a better future to the world, is what truly matters.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I am sure you may have heard about Jim Carrey and his “bizarre” interview:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He was on Norm MacDonalds&#39; show recently and said much the same thing. To me, he sounds like an incredibly depressed, lost individual, who has lost his moorings in reality after the death of his girlfriend and seeks comfort in oblivion. I believe he is indeed a &quot;false prophet&quot; so to speak, concerning these beliefs.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I feel that Buddhism (and similar beliefs) increase the belief that one should take no action and just accept things as they are.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have also reached the same conclusion. I believe this is because Buddhism was born within a Caste System society, and was a means of escapism, of realizing they were screwed no matter what, and was ultimately a retreat into oneself in order to alleviate the pains of the world. This is in contrast to the West, where we moved from an impersonal set of pantheistic religions, to a personal oriented, paradise promising Monotheistic Christianity, as a means to alleviate the pains of the world and to seek a better life.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In my mind, the ego does NOT have to be our enemy. Having an awareness of our ego is great, but unfortunately, many people do not have that awareness.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I completely agree. Being aware of oneself, and who one truly is, is absolutely essential. The hard part, is moving beyond this, while still recognizing it, in an attempt to live for one another. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>If there is nothing, then all we have is this short, meaningless existence, which leads people to worry about materialism and pleasure – not meaning.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Even then, these people are misguided. If we truly are nothing but atoms and matter and stardust, then what matters is this incredible, miraculous emergence of consciousness. The fact that we are the Universe experiencing itself. This logically makes Life that much more precious, which means what matters isn&#39;t <em>ourselves</em>, but one another. </p>

<p>Hope some of this makes sense and is a meaningful contribution to yet another well thought out post :) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly!</p>

<p>By the way I was raised in a Buddhist household.</p>

<p>My dad meditateds an hour a day and I&#39;m not kidding when I say he ONLY cares about himself and his world. </p>

<p>Is this a result of meditating or was he drawn to meditation because of his already narcisstic qualities?</p>

<p>Meditation has many benefits. The problem lies in when people think it is the answer to everything.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Ego&quot; is a concept. It is a model of consciousness. Even accepting it&#39;s validity as a model of human experience and existence, it is deeply flawed in it&#39;s representation of the self through time and the accuracy of memory. The position that ones life is ultimately meaningless does not necessitate hedonism, consumerism, nihilism, or anything else because those positions are meaningless as well. As flawed human beings with a poor map of reality we can make our best guess as to how to live our lives. There is no ultimate point at which we will know if we were right or wrong. There is simply our choice to decide to live and accept our choices. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are many conceptions of God, and many or more books defining and/or explaining the precepts of each and every God. The Christian God of the New Testament can be said to emphasize humility and service, and this may bring peace, understanding, and a meaningful life to you, but that in no way makes the claims of the religion true. As best I can tell our brains/consciousness is a story telling machine that convinces many of the existence of a stable and continuous &quot;self&quot;. The continuity of the &quot;self&quot; has been shown scientifically, many times, to be illusory. Ultimately (from my viewpoint) your finding happiness in a non-destructive and perhaps positive life is a good thing. I have no evidence of this, but I &quot;believe&quot; it is so. I suppose the only difference is you would say a book told you this and I would say, I decided it myself.</p>

Enjoy your Muslim, Hindu, Shinto, Christian, Buddhist, Jewish, Mormon, Wiccan, etc. faith and there unshakable truth.   </p>

<p>The KGB can claim that they introduced or spread Eastern religion, but I don&#39;t buy it for a moment. Sounds like they were trying to destabilize after the fact, trying to get people to lose faith in the things that give them strength, or just talking shit.

There is no consolidated conspiracy that explains the New Age, just lots of cultural factors (of which Russian operatives might have played a minor role?). </p>

<p>We can never eliminate ego it’s like trying to beat yourself in chess. Mr. Robot I thought had an excellent visualization of trying to beat ego. You hit, it hits you back just as hard, maybe even twice. You approach your ego as a firm father it will listen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let me jump in on some points,  </p>

<p>why is the ego considered &quot;bad&quot;? 
The ego, and thus worrying about what others think of you, drains you of energy, am I dancing the right way/ do I look good/ what do other people think of me, all those thoughts are endless loops and to your mental and maybe also your physical health ( as those two seem to be directly related)  it is good for you if you stop worrying and &quot;do not give a f&quot; </p>

<p>Why does it not seem to fit with Jim Carrey?  Carrey has been famous and wealthy for quite some time, his mind has gotten used to this status he might say nothing has a meaning blabla but he does not act like it, this creates an incongruence. If you speak and maybe think one way and act another it always seems off. Maybe he read a couple ideas which resonated good with him, but he is far from being enlightened. </p>

<p>This all has to do with the struggle between body and mind, losing old habits to create new ones and maybe change your personality. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ego is our personal influence that together with our unconsiouss and consiousness our actions and interactions with our &quot;reality&quot;.</p>

<p>The trick is not to get rid of the ego, but be aware and proud of it and use it to create a &quot;reality&quot; you actually want to experience instead of the one that is being &quot;forced&quot; upon you. And consious know what influence this experience will have on your and our &quot;reality&quot;.</p>

<p>You will need a lot of information on how to use your natural creating powers without getting caught in the many traps that are used in this &quot;reality&quot; and the truth you will find within Love and yourself can show you how to evolve as a whole.</p>

<p>Great post, as always. I&#39;m quite drunk at this point, so bear with me if some of my points are repetitions from past comments on your posts.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Haha I feel you ; )</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I agree with your Thesis on the Ego. As I have said before...if we are truly nothing but star dust, then what really matters is each other, our human brothers and sisters who we are blessed to live and experience this tiny fraction of our 13.8 billion year old cosmos with. As you said- to live for one another is to be fulfilled. To live for our children, and humanities children, to build a better future to the world, is what truly matters.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I am sure you may have heard about Jim Carrey and his “bizarre” interview:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He was on Norm MacDonalds&#39; show recently and said much the same thing. To me, he sounds like an incredibly depressed, lost individual, who has lost his moorings in reality after the death of his girlfriend and seeks comfort in oblivion. I believe he is indeed a &quot;false prophet&quot; so to speak, concerning these beliefs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He almost seems like he is detached and facing depersonalization through multiple personalities.</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I feel that Buddhism (and similar beliefs) increase the belief that one should take no action and just accept things as they are.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have also reached the same conclusion. I believe this is because Buddhism was born within a Caste System society, and was a means of escapism, of realizing they were screwed no matter what, and was ultimately a retreat into oneself in order to alleviate the pains of the world. This is in contrast to the West, where we moved from an impersonal set of pantheistic religions, to a personal oriented, paradise promising Monotheistic Christianity, as a means to alleviate the pains of the world and to seek a better life.</p>

<p>Wow great point!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In my mind, the ego does NOT have to be our enemy. Having an awareness of our ego is great, but unfortunately, many people do not have that awareness.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I completely agree. Being aware of oneself, and who one truly is, is absolutely essential. The hard part, is moving beyond this, while still recognizing it, in an attempt to live for one another. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>If there is nothing, then all we have is this short, meaningless existence, which leads people to worry about materialism and pleasure – not meaning.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Even then, these people are misguided. If we truly are nothing but atoms and matter and stardust, then what matters is this incredible, miraculous emergence of consciousness. The fact that we are the Universe experiencing itself. This logically makes Life that much more precious, which means what matters isn&#39;t <em>ourselves</em>, but one another. </p>

<p>Hope some of this makes sense and is a meaningful contribution to yet another well thought out post :) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It all did. Thanks for your thoughts as always!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So if someone is an atheist for 30 or 40 years, and then they suddenly change, you think it must be because they are emotionally or intellectually incompetent?</p>

<p>It sounds like you are saying that there is a zero percent chance they had a rational, fact based reason for making that life decision to stop being an atheist.  How can you know this; isn&#39;t it a logical fallacy?</p>

<p>So basically, people who don&#39;t believe the same as you, must not be fully equipped?  That&#39;s jacked up, my friend.</p>

<p>Have you read the entire bible?  Are you 100% sure it doesn&#39;t make sense, or are you just repeating what someone told you?</p>

<p>I myself had problems with religion growing up.  I often repeated the criticisms I had heard.  When I finally started studying religion in an honest capacity, the same as I would any other subject, I realized I had been wrong, I had been cocky, and I had judged based on assumptions and my own lack of knowledge.</p>
