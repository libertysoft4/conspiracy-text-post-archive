    <div class="md"><p>There was a 6 day war, started by Syria, Jordan, Egypt and Palestinians (maybe others), which Israel won and extended their territories (which were initially set by Brit, as colonial gov of the region and UN. ) Egypt has signed a peace agreement (with Jimmy Carter brokering. ) The other nations have not.  So there were armies, but no peace agreements. If you want to keep your citizens safe, you make peace with the victor. That’s how war works, last I checked.  </p>

<p>These countries have chosen a barbaric world where there is no peace bec they refuse to come to the table and sign a peace agreement. They are endangering their ppl and threatening Israelies on conquered territory they refuse to cede bec they want Israel gone entirely.  Hamas leaders recently refused to recognize Israel even if they signed a peace agreement. What’s up with that?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What happened in Pakistan and Bangladesh was supposed to happen in Palestine by being partitioned by British. If you want to call them terrorists, whatever. The same infighting silliness did not follow. I have recently been made aware similar problems have occurred in Sahara. </p>

<p>The Zionist label and their agenda is worrisome and I’m not sure how that fits in with the larger picture. Zionism is not Judaism. You cannot call all Israelis Zionists. Many devout Jews condemn the actions of Israel’s govt.  However, there are also questionable actions and attitudes of the Arabs. </p>

<p>The Jews were “chosen” by God thru no merit of their own, and throughout the scriptures God’s directive is to welcome and incorporate foreigners.  Foreigners are in bloodline of Messiah Jesus, and their worth is not questioned.  So your ‘true, pure race’ argument is lacking.  Aren’t Arabs and Jews from the same patriarch, Abraham?  How does the race issue even make sense? </p>

<p>My agenda is to figure out who benefits from this division and prolonged enmity.  What I see is a lot of noise and little attention to facts. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>They lost the war.</p>

<p>You mean they were ethnically cleansed.  The situation is in limbo because nominally the 67 borders are held as framework, while the reality is that Israel has colonized the West Bank, keeping the population there under military occupation. All the while building a society where Jews and under religious populations don&#39;t enjoy equal representation or protection under law. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No.<br/>
The surrounding countries were not happy with the 67 borders and started wars with Israel, which is why Israel won the 6 day war and occupied the territories. The Israeli settlements were alongside Palestinians, they were not purged, as you imply.  Just as many Jews were purged from many countries by expulsion, the Palestinians had this option as well.

<p>They were kicked out of their homes and forced to settle in refugee camps. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The modern actions of Israel are reprehensible, no doubt about it. The issue I have with the claims that &quot;Israel stole land from the Palestinians&quot; is that it&#39;s only half true. Zionist groups back in the mid 19th century purchased land from the Ottoman Empire. With the collapse of the Ottoman Empire more land was purchased through Turkey and then again through Britain when it occupied Palestine post-WWI. </p>

<p>So, while Israel has pushed into Palestinian land and done some horrible things to Palestinians, their initial land claims in the Jordan Valley were valid land purchases. Whether the Palestinians agree is a seperate issue.</p>

<p>It&#39;s very similar to the colonization of North America. One could argue the US stole the land west of the Mississippi, when really it was purchased from France. Similarly land &quot;stolen&quot; from Palestine in the 19th century was actually purchased from the Turks. </p>

<p>At the end of the day neither Israel or Palestine truly want peace. Both have valid claims and arguments, both have a whole list of reasons to hate each other.</p>

<p>I recently learned that tensions between Jews and Muslims does not go back thousands of years as I was always taught, conflict yes, but not the sort of vitriol we have today. Back in the early dys of Zionism, Arab king Faisal actually agreed to the Balfour Declaration (which stated British support for a national home for Jews). Faisal needed British support to help establish the Arab Kingdom of Syria, though the British would later reneg on the his promise, siding instead with the French claim to Syria. (And people wonder why the middle east is in such turmoil and harbors such resentment for western society.)</p>

<p>(It&#39;s worth noting I&#39;m talking about King Faisal I of Iraq, not the Saudi Arabian Faisal.)</p>

<p>Here&#39;s quote from Faisal that sums some of his thoughts relevant to this topic:</p>

<p>&quot;We Arabs... look with the deepest sympathy on the Zionist movement. Our deputation here in Paris is fully acquainted with the proposals submitted yesterday by the Zionist Organisation to the Peace Conference, and we regard them as moderate and proper. We will do our best, insofar as we are concerned, to help them through; we will wish the Jews a most hearty welcome home... I look forward, and my people with me look forward, to a future in which we will help you and you will help us, so that the countries in which we are mutually interested may once again take their places in the community of the civilised peoples of the world.&quot;</p>

<p>So, while Israel has pushed into Palestinian land and done some horrible things to Palestinians, their initial land claims in the Jordan Valley were valid land purchases. Whether the Palestinians agree is a seperate issue.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Purchasing stolen property is still a crime, and is not a &quot;legal transaction&quot;.</p>

<p>Aside from that, does this mean that Chinese can buy property in the US and declare it to be a new nation?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s why I compared it to the colonization of America. </p>

<p>As for China buying US land and creating a new nation, I don&#39;t know exactly how that would work but it doesn&#39;t seem unreasonable that they could do it. The closest example I can think of would be China leasing Hong Kong to Britain. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You could try to look at this debate from another simpler point of view- say you have a big beautiful house with yards and bountiful fruit and vegetable garden, chicken coop, the whole lot. Then one perplexing day a stranger help himself to a portion of your land. He just up and pitched his camp there and not only he refused to bugger off out of your land- he has a big brother protecting him and  supplying him with sharp fork to stab you and some loud firecrackers to disrupt your peace and scare your newborn baby. You called the police and the authorities but all of them just soothed you with some pretty words then just left you to deal with it. The next day the stranger stole more of your land, the next day some more. And now you are sleeping in the chicken coop and the stranger and his brother are making some toast in your nice kitchen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, you are forgetting to account for the fact your beautiful property was lost to invading armies in war, and you had already lost ownership of it —First to the ottomans and then to Britain.  You’re  not accounting for the fact these invaders made the decision to disrupt your life by giving away your property (which was theirs to do so, apparently) to someone else.  You’re forgetting to account for the fact you went to war with the new owners abec you disagreed with this decision and LOST the war and more land. Explain to me how you can lose a war which you started and not accept the consequences of your actions?  </p>
