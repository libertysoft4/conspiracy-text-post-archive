        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I want to share an observation I made involving this Marina Abramovic chick (whose recently been the topic of many discussions relating to the whole pizzagate scandal and the Podesta emails). </p>

<p>The specific ritual she asks Tony Pedo(esta) (&lt;-- only appropriate) as mentioned <a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/3678009/marina-abramovic-who-the-hell-is-the-spirit-cooker-in-the-wikileaks-podesta-emails-graphic-photos/">here</a> is called <strong>Spirit Cooking</strong>. This ritual was actually created by <strong><a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;esrc=s&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;cd=1&amp;amp;cad=rja&amp;amp;uact=8&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwi-75Dp-v7XAhUCRiYKHeluBfEQFggpMAA&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FAleister_Crowley&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw2NHtjJ443fGPYBBdIyqueO">Aleister Crowley</a></strong>, to whom <em>had to be</em> her <strong>hero</strong>. </p>

<p>Here is my reasoning: I&#39;ve been researching this weird sick fuck Crowley for a while out of sheer curiosity (There&#39;s an excellent video about him <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6-v9K4X3Do">here</a> and in doing so I&#39;m familiar with one of the central topics included in his radical and absolutely vile book <a href="http://www.sacred-texts.com/oto/engccxx.htm">The book of the Law / Liber AL vel Legis</a> is this notion called <em>Abrahadabra</em></p>

<p><strong>As cited from the above link in The Book of the Law in Chapter 3, line 1</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Abrahadabra; the reward of Ra Hoor Khut.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>It has a much deeper meaning but I&#39;ll leave that up to you to research. So check this shit out:</p>

<p><strong>Marina (Abra)movic</strong> &lt;--wtf??</p>

<p>Does anyone else see what I see? The words &quot;Abra&quot; are spelled exactly the same as in her name (Marina <strong>Abra</strong>movic). </p>

<p><strong>BUT WAIT THERE&#39;S MORE</strong></p>

<p>So the last part of her first name is Movic...maybe I&#39;m on a sick one (entirely possible), but it sounds a lot like &quot;Movie&quot; to me..I would in fact take to literally imply <em>of or having to do with movies, acting or performing arts</em>. ISN&#39;T THIS CHICK AN ACTRESS OR INVOLVED IN HOLLYWOOD SOMEHOW? IS THAT STRANGE OR WHAT?? Really, I&#39;m asking. am i loosing it?</p>

<p>Can anyone research and find out if this crazy bitch changed her name or is it just a wierd ass coincidence that her name happens to include in it a reference to a <em>major</em> idea in a book written by the very person whom influenced her &quot;Spirit Cooking&quot; dinner parties she has personally invited both Podesta brothers AND HILLARY CLINTON to as well????????</p>

<p>The reason this is interesting : <a href="https://io9.gizmodo.com/according-to-the-internet-aleister-crowley-was-george-1745967571">https://io9.gizmodo.com/according-to-the-internet-aleister-crowley-was-george-1745967571</a>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s frankly amazing that you didn&#39;t just firstly know that this was a common name (the owner of Chelsea football club has a derivative of the name), and second that you didn&#39;t try and research the name first before coming up with this impressively creative theory about its meaning. Why did you not just find out the history of the name before building up this theory of yours? Did you put the same effort into your other theories? Just curious to see how you got to where you are.

Ok guys here’s my theory..
DEB is 1 syllable and DUBSTEP is 2, 1+2 is 3, there’s 3 leaves on clover and clovers are green, green is 5 letters so 3 + 5 is 8. He’s a computer programmer so he must know viruses. Meaning he has a cold. Viruses has 3 syllables. 3 x 8 is 24. Ok I’ll get back to this. Cold is the opposite of hot. It’s the coldest in Antarctica. There’s a hole in the ozone at the bottom of the world. Hole is 4 letters. 24/4 is 6. DEBDUBSTEP starts with a d, like Dante. Dubstep is music. The devil likes music. Ok guys I know what your thinking DEBDUBSTEP can’t be the devil. No he’ll is hot and DEBDUBSTEP has a cold. Dubstep isn’t just music is considered by a marginal amount to be “lesser” if you will. So if hell is hot, heaven is a Paradise of temperate proportions, it must be purgatory that is cold. 3 distinct regions of temperature. 3 6’s creates a series... 666. He must be a demon from the white relentless void to spew shitty music. </p>
