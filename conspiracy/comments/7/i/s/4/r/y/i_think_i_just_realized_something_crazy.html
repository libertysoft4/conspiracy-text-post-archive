<p>Lets think of something for a minute: Who else is extremely old, and may be another gatekeeper? The Queen of England. </p>

<p>Something tells me once she dies, SHIT REALLLLLLY hits the fan. This is why I think most of the conspiracies of the anti-christ revolve around one of the princes because it is likely that they will try to usurp and maintain the infrastructure that the Queen has held together, and the deep state wars keeps happening. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think there will be an economic collapse for as long as the Queen lives.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think this runs into problems because you see the Queen as the gatekeeper. The reality is that the <em>bloodline</em> is the gatekeeper. As long as the House of Windsor and other noble bloodlines survive, this shit wont hit the fan. Charles will keep this shit going, as will William. It is literally what they were born, and raised, to do. </p>

<p>Indeed. Hefner was linked with a lot of nefarious people too...</p>

<p>Have you ever heard the story of Playboy bunny Paige Young&#39;s suicide?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2857873/Passed-Bill-Cosby-Hugh-Hefner-dozens-Hollywood-honchos-Playboy-Playmate-Month-felt-used-abused-powerful-leading-men-took-gun-shot-head.html">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2857873/Passed-Bill-Cosby-Hugh-Hefner-dozens-Hollywood-honchos-Playboy-Playmate-Month-felt-used-abused-powerful-leading-men-took-gun-shot-head.html</a></p>

<p><em>‘It was chilling,’ she recalls. ‘There was a large American flag draped across her bed and there was a pentagram laid out on the wooden floor.’</em></p>

<p><em>Myers added: ‘I remember her showing me around it because it was somehow important, but I didn’t know what it meant.’</em></p>

<p><em>But it was the bedroom wall that shocked Myers the most.</em></p>

<p><em>‘It was covered floor to ceiling with photos of Hugh Hefner,’ she said. ‘There were news clippings, magazine articles, everything you could think of. Written across it was something like: “Hugh Hefner is the devil”.</em></p>

<p><em>‘The whole wall was a shrine saying, “I hate Hugh Hefner”, the crux of her anger was against him.</em></p>

<p><em>‘That was the message she wanted to get across to me. She was pointing up at things, showing me around it.</em></p>

<p><em>‘She’d put a lot of work into this, it must have taken her days.’ Myers said that Young then calmly explained that she planned to kill herself.</em></p>

<p><em>She produced a gun and put it in to her mouth.</em></p>

<p><em>‘Paige lay back on her bed, put the gun in her mouth and said, ”this is how I’m going to do it”,’ recalls Myers.</em></p>

<p>For instance, you went from &#39;Hugh Hefner&#39; to the &#39;Queen of England&#39;, by quality of &#39;oldness&#39;. </p>

<p>So, first Hugh is a &#39;gatekeeper&#39;, and then the queen, because they are old, and people are being outed for sexual harassment. </p>

<p>Okay, Why?  Okay, HOW?  okay, WHen?  Okay, Who exactly.</p>

<p>LEt&#39;s start with the first proposition: provide evidence Hefner is a &#39;gatekeeper&#39;, to an organization you claim exists without evidence. </p>

<p>In other words, apply some fucking evidence please.</p>
