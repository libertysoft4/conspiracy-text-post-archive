    <div class="md"><p>&quot;If we hit that bullseye, the rest of the dominoes should fall like a house of cards. Checkmate!&quot;</p>

<p>Something is unfolding, that much is clear. Is anyone familiar enough with crime statistics to be able to compare the number of trafficking arrests during each of the recent few administrations?</p>

<p>If there really is as much of a difference as Lady MegBeth clearly indicates, that comparison would make the claim of Trump being &quot;just another puppet&quot; practically void.</p>

You can do a search on this database and narrow the search with start and end date. There&#39;s a lot of info on that site, all incidents are with a source.

    <div class="md"><p>Wow, the east coast is a hotbed of trafficking stories. Thanks for the link.</p>

<p>I guess to actually compare the &quot;success rate&quot; in federal anti-trafficking operations between the last few presidencies I&#39;d have to go through each incident recording the numbers manually. I&#39;m afraid I can&#39;t spare that time at the moment, but if anyone can, it might prove to be a pertinent statistic to have on hand in times like these.</p>

<p>Maybe I&#39;ll be able to go through a couple of years on the weekend.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>She implies that the society is not ready:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot; In hinsight, it was all shits and giggles just thinking the government fucked with our taxes, our economy, our laws, freedoms, rights, liberties, health, healthcare, educations and pursuits of happiness, right?! Now we’re forced to realize they’ve literally trafficked, abused, fucked and murdered, our innocent children... all in our own country, under our own noses, for decades. That’s not only a ridiculously tough, but very emotional, deeply personal pill of reality, for anyone to swallow... let alone EVERYONE to swallow, at the same time. Which in reality, is exactly what you’d need to accomplish, to ever beat it, right? You’d need EVERYONE to not only know and accept the fact that it’s not only happening on the levels and to the extent that it is, but you’d also need them all to know and accept it, to that extreme extent, at exactly the same time.</p>

<p>Sure WE want to see it all drop, right now and watch them all burn to the ground for it, but that’s only because WE have already had time to slowly and progressively research, read, learn, absorb, mentally/emotionally/logically process it all and then factually accept and acknowledge the reality. WE are a very slim minority though and you need to remember that because realistically it’s very important. &quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think this &#39;society is not ready&#39; thing is a load of crap. Yeah people will be shocked and upset and devastated and emotionally and psychologically scarred, but people are resilient and it is really needed for this to ever stop. Most people would much prefer to find out about this stuff and feel shocked and appalled and horrified and deceived than for it to cntinue happening in secret with these types of monsters getting away with it. It&#39;s wrong to keep this from the people as though they&#39;re all just too delicate and pathetic to face up to what&#39;s been going on - this is way more important than how bad people are going to feel about it, what about all the people and children who are being abused by this stuff, what about how they feel?!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Civilization as a whole is a very fragile phenomena. It depends on all the relevant pieces (infrastructure) to believe in and therefore faithfully fulfill their duties. If the false-pretense of democracy, freedom, and equal protection under the law fail, there are substantial consequences.</p>

<p>We saw it happen on a smaller scale w/Trump being elected. Enough people realized that the system was rigged, and they voted for the guy who vowed to save it and turn it around (Make America Great <strong>Again</strong>), but at what point would people just say fuck it and completely disregard the old system for which the world has come to depend? Innocent young children being raped, tortured, murdered, and in some cases eaten, might just be that tipping point.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>True words. I seem to remember that HLI made a similar point about the potentially destructive force these kinds of truths can bring with them if they aren&#39;t handled with the utmost care.</p>

<p>I need only look at my own experience. I know these things to be going on without the shadow of a doubt at this point, as most of us do on this board, but I can&#39;t say I&#39;ve fully grasped the reality yet of what that truly means. Megs describes it well. We all knew this shit for way too long without allowing ourselves to fully understand the fucking terror which has been cast onto this world by a handful of powerful, degenerate fucks.</p>

<p>Now that the veil would appear to be closer to being lifted than ever before in our history, it seems like a good time to come to grips with what we know so we can help our friends and families cope with this ever-increasing madness we find underneath.</p>

<p>True.</p>

<p><a href="https://archive.4plebs.org/pol/thread/144542510/#q144562770">She said</a> two months ago:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;If you&#39;ve been keeping up and reading between the lines, you&#39;d realize LOTS of things I&#39;ve said have been happening. But we th that, please note... you (as in all of /pol/) are always looking for, waiting on, expecting something you&#39;re never going to get on exactly the level you&#39;re hoping... and in all honesty, you better hope it never comes to that. You&#39;re never going to see Hillary and 30% of congress (on both sides of the aisle) going down for pizza. Not because YOU (and the rest of /pol/ type people) couldn&#39;t handle it, but because THE MASSES COULDNT HANDLE IT. It was literally JFK and Reagan&#39;s biggest concerns and it&#39;s specifically why they BOTH AND MANY OTHERS, have held back a lot. It&#39;s also our next best shot (Trump&#39;s) biggest concern. Do you realize on a completely rational level what would happen if a president or anyone with as much comparable clout, authority or national recognition, dumped this kind of shit without planning and preparation?! I mean aren&#39;t you and a majority of the people HERE ON /pol/ because you CAN&#39;T talk about this shit to an overwhelming majority of everyone you know, the way it SHOULD be talked about?! You&#39;re just YOU. Imagine being a fucking &quot;truther&quot; president of the UNITED STATES OF FUCKING AMERICA... which is basically like being the leader of the world considering how much the rest of the world, depends on us. Think about it. &quot;</p>

Five hundred years ago, everybody knew the Earth was flat, and fifteen minutes ago, you knew that humans were alone on this planet. Imagine what you&#39;ll know tomorrow.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Roy Moore is in Alabama. and people there are voting for not because they’d rather have a pedophile than a democrat. THEY WONT TRUST THE DEMOCRATS. PERIOD. ON ANYTHING. </p>

<p>if someone had said to you, in 2016 we’d have a party that sold nuclear materials to russia, paid Iran trillions of dollars, sold guns to marco terrorist in mexico, met with social media execs once a month for 8 years about god knows what, expanded torture, expanded printing money expanded debt, expanded war, allowed a embassy to come under play tack ( idle failed to provide aid) and then tried to blame it i a jewish filmmaker, rigged an election, infiltrated the media and the Catholic church. and tried to get us into a war with Russian after they lost the election, a bee white president being blamed for policing that was deemed racist and that started under a black president, or that a presidential candidate would have a rapist as a husband and then the nerve to cry sexual harassment to her opponent, well..... people would  tell you your crazy. but it happened, and no one seems to care. except  Republicans. who are so sick of the corruption on the left , they can’t or won’t even trust them about ANYTHING anymore. </p>

<p>and since Gloria Allred has zero credibility and won’t turn over evidence and the step son of the accuser has said that the accuser has taken money to make these claims , well you have to wonder who is right and who is lying.  it sure who. but i know has lied more than anyone else. and it ain’t Roy Moore. </p>

<p>though if he did do it, i’d hope everyone could come together put him in jail. </p>

<p>(btw, let me be clear that if I could I would do unspeakable things to any pedo, but lately the way users have been white knighting people in power, my post is dedicated to them)</p>

<p>It stained the collective mind long enough. Its fun watching maher trying to get outraged about republican sex scandals but say nothing about pizzagate. Mentioned it once like 11 months ago and zilch.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry for &quot;invading <em>your</em> subreddit&quot;, i actually like the discussions about conspiracy theories, it&#39;s just that it&#39;s ao blatantly obvious that this &quot;pizzagate&quot; thing is a partisan false flag to get people riled up that it makes me sad</p>
