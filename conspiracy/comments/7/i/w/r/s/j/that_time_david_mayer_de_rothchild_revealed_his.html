    <div class="md"><p>So let me get this strait. When I meditate. Which I do frequently. All the activity the thoughts the impressions.The things that happen in a mind when you meditate... You are telling me that&#39;s schizophrenia. In psychology I enjoy Carl jungs work. The conscious and the subconscious. Archetypes. All that. Dreams, Waking dreams, ect. More schizophrenia? I have never hallucinated anything except for that time I smoked Salvia. Can you differentiate every thought and snip in your mind. Which ones are yours. Which ones are stories you once heard. Which ones are put there by marketing and advertising. Which ones are things you make up. That&#39;s the beauty of regular quiet meditation. You can spend time sorting through it all. Take a moment and read the DSM on schizophrenia. That statement... wraps 2 nice conspiracies into one sentence. Good times on a Sunday night. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fair, once again.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t fully buy into this being evidence that this guy is shapeshifting reptilian. But taking into account that inter-dimensional entities probably do exist(according to my research) and that the Rothchilds are one of the most powerful families in the world(also responsible for much of the chaos and destruction that exists on this planet), a clip like this certainly raises some eyebrows. Not saying that your explanation of &quot;compression artifacts&quot; isn&#39;t what&#39;s actually going on but I am also inclined to consider whether this isn&#39;t an actual case of what I describe in my title.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you were a member of one of the most powerful families on the planet... and someone caught you red handed on film shape shifting from human to reptile eyeballs, don&#39;t you think you&#39;d be powerful enough to have the tape destroyed immediately? I guess you could posit that these shapeshifters don&#39;t have the ability to detect when they are changing forms... but then they would most likely be smart enough to avoid public appearances at all lest their ruse be discovered. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Makes sense but could there be an alternate explanation, like they don&#39;t really care knowing that the majority of the masses are so blind that they won&#39;t see it(or care), or as the elites love to flaunt their shenanigans(a la &quot;hidden in plain sight&quot;), maybe they are exposing themselves in public knowing this type of soft disclosure will grant them enough plausible deniability?</p>
