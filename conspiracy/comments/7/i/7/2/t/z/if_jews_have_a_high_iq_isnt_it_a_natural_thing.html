    <div class="md"><p>It would make sense, not since. Sounds the same, totally different meaning. </p>

<p>Also, if they really were God&#39;s chosen people, then they would not be so typically gosh darn UGLY, or have so many nasty genetic diseases. There are a whole lot of other people in the world who are much, much more attractive [most of them] and healthier than the Jews. The good looking Jews are the exception, NOT the rule. As a group of people, they are basically very unattractive, downright ugly even. I can see why they boil with jealousy against the other, more attractive races. </p>

<p>A social coping strategy for this defect of theirs that would be better than attempting to dominate us all, would be interbreeding with better looking and physically healthier people; but that is not encouraged by their self defeating religion. They would rather use their &#39;Sampson Option&#39; and kill us all in a big nuclear war, than admit they are not the greatest. That kind of hubris deserves a nemesis. </p>

You&#39;re still trying to steer the conversation toward race-baiting. Of all of the people I&#39;ve met and talked to who are opposed to Zionism, only a very small percentage were motivated by &quot;white pride&quot; or any kind of race-related consideration. You&#39;re committing logical fallacies left and right. What you&#39;re trying to do with the conversation is dishonest.

<p>What can be annoying about Jewish people is that they practice tribal nepotism, meaning they overwhelmingly hire and promote Jews over goyim. They are shielded from criticism for doing so through claims of anti-semitism and bringing up the Holohoax. And they often pretend to be white when talking badly about white people, while actually considering themselves Jewish and not white.</p>

<p>Jews are not superior, they just use cultural methods to get ahead as a group. Methods that I would compare to those used by organized crime rings and the mafia. I would not brag about something so utterly corrupt. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I studied IQ as an interesting amateur research topic. It is surprisingly related to early sexual child abuse. People who are sexually abused as small children develop a personality that is hyper attuned to threats and manifests in a higher intelligence. This is the backbone of the MKUltra program. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Be careful if you meant to mix the term sexual abuse and child abuse.</p>

<p>**most children who are in an abusive family will experience the traits you speak of - but that abuse is not necessarily sexual. It might vary from physical or mental abuse to neglect and might never manifest in a sexual nature. But any of those types of abuse would likely produce a higher iq in the adult children of abusers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its not high IQ, its nepotism and favoritism how they over represent in the ivy league schools (by 25%+)  which translates into the high paying jobs and opportunities. Their SAT scores are lower than Asians and some other Caucasians (why the doj is looking at harvard Etc).  Its not a meritocracy (neither is Hollywood and their high paying opportunities).  Basically its a scam in the simplest form.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Like Asians, Jews do have a fairly high average IQ. Whites have a larger range of IQ, though, and there are more Whites with an IQ over 140 than there are Jews in the entire world.</p>

<p>It would help if you explained what exactly you mean by &quot;Jewish conspiracy theory.&quot; They are overrepresented, that is a fact. But why? I think its mostly because of the Jewish banking families acquiring vast amounts of wealth and power early on, coupled with tribal nepotism and a shield against criticism for this practice via the Holocaust.</p>
