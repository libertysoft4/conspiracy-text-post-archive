        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It&#39;s come to my attention that many in this sub seem to think certain groups(Muslims/Blacks) are genetically inferior to the rest of the world. It&#39;s my personal belief that circumstances play a much bigger role in determining behaviors than predisposition. While the disparity in crime rates between blacks/whites in America are often cited as an argument for the former, as I&#39;ve stated, I believe these numbers can be attributed to socio-economic factors and most importantly, an unaddressed case of intergenerational Trauma. </p>

<p>If we are to be intellectually honest, we must take into account that blacks have consistently been deprived, whether wittingly or unwittingly, of the necessary resources(education, opportunities) to thrive in our society without turning to a life of crime. Contrary to the belief that blacks are genetically predisposed to be more violent or mischievous, I believe there is sufficient data out there or at the least, enough so that a strong case can be made that these are cases of nurture rather than nature. </p>

<p>Lastly, I will touch on intergenerational trauma and how it relates to blacks and their behaviors. Studies have consistently shown that an individual&#39;s experience can be encoded in their genes and be passed on to their progeny for multiple generations. This is verified in a  relatively new field called Epigenetics. Those who disagree with my aforementioned argument will often roll their eyes at the mention of slavery and the consequent oppression of blacks in American society(extending to the modern day IMO) but it is disingenuous to minimize the impact that such traumatic experiences can have on the collective psyche of any group.</p>

<p>Just as we look empathetically for a psychological explanation when children exhibit behavioral problems at school, often wondering if they are not the victim of some form of abuse, we must apply the same logic when analyzing the high crime rates of blacks. Just as a troubled child ought to sit down with a therapist and given the opportunity to address and heal whatever trauma he may have experienced, the same must be applied to a population has been sitting in a daze after having been subjugated to a series of the most insidious, soul-crushing events. </p>

<p>What I am not advocating for is the enabling of the troubled behaviors of blacks. I hope I can be clear about this. What I am arguing is that it is intellectually dishonest to ignore the aforementioned factors and jump to the conclusion that these behaviors must be evidence for genetic inferiority.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I honestly hate lumping all blacks (or any other group) together. I think each person is different. So the nature/nurture percentages would be different for each person.</p>

<p>But I do know (from having a son with autism) that the first 5 years are extremely important to a person&#39;s development. So nurture does play a big part.</p>

<p>Still, nature plays a significant part too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fair. But also consider that that&#39;s very different from chattel slavery where blacks were literally enslaved and dehumanized for generations, any morale they had being beaten out of them. After their emancipation, the oppression continued in other ways, lynchings, systemic racism, mass incarcerations, police brutality, all within the same nation. Not to mention, this is all fairly recent. Also consider that many of Asian immigrants that came to the US were presumably the ones who were a sub group, presumably having had some form of education or closure from the traumas they had experienced.</p>

<p>Humans choose mates for purely evolutionarily proscribed reasons. Fitness. Health. Attractiveness.

<p>You&#39;re a part of the problem if you think that it is, and that we don&#39;t. The irony with people like you, is quite laughable, but sad. <em>You don&#39;t even realize the hate and oppression you perpetuate.</em> Keep trying to &quot;unite&quot; while constantly causing ignorant division.

    <div class="md"><p>Nice ninja edit on your last reply by the way. What I need to tell myself is irrelevant. What is relevant is that there are people with educations that determine these things and they are almost unanimously in agreement that you&#39;re wrong.</p>

<p>99% of Muslims are born into Islam as a result of their geographic location and of no choice of their own. Of course an Asian person from China can convert to Islam. But when you look at the middle east for example, you have a race of Muslims, and countries that have laws suited to Islam. They are a muslim race and they have nationalities according to their countries. Some are also of the Arab race, or Persian race, or they are caucasian. Some might say their race is middle eastern. Just because you haven&#39;t been educated enough, that doesn&#39;t change scientific and historical consensus. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. The victim mindset is often the most convenient defense mechanism for actual victims - as it is much more comforting to wallow in self-pity than to conjure up the courage to face your fears and overcome them.</p>

<p>With that said, sometimes the trauma is so severe(as I believe is in the case of blacks and slavery) that there is a certain amount of time and empathy that should be allowed for them to dust themselves off and get back up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with your points. Although I don&#39;t believe it&#39;s really a conspiracy, it&#39;s more like poverty affecting the outcomes of people&#39;s lives. It can also be viewed more locally, I live in Scotland and most areas of the country have certain stereotypes associated with them, i.e. People from X location are uneducated and have 2 or 3 kids by the time they are 19. I feel like racism is just an escalation of these stereotypes, anyone can find out that plenty of people from whatever race or religion have done great things, but before they learn that, it&#39;s the initial stereotype that sticks in their minds. I suppose it all boils down to media and history. </p>

<p>And as a side note, although I don&#39;t think this is a conspiracy, the post itself does no harm, and has good points. I always check the post history of the posters that I read, and I don&#39;t think it&#39;s right to dismiss someone from posting here, or attempt to redirect or attack a post that I don&#39;t agree with. The influx of shills and trolls should not turn us against each other, encourage interesting posts and think for yourself people! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>When you proclaim &quot;but it is disingenuous to minimize the impact that such traumatic experiences can have on the collective psyche of any group.&quot;, that&#39;s implying that any collective traumatic experience of a race or ethnic group is devastating to the psyche of that group currently. Even when none of the population has experienced it. It would be to say as if all Europeans or people of European ancestry still can feel the experiences of Muslims that invaded Europe and took millions of Europeans as slaves, and that its ingraved into their genetics when most Europeans have never heard of these Muslim conquests. But onto some of your other points, I don&#39;t think any other races are inferior, but I do think particularly Sub-Saharan Africans, Peloponnesian groups and Caucasus Region peoples as well as other minor Afroeurasian regions and ethnic groups have inferior cultures and how people are raised. So I do think it is technically circumstancial, but the thing that makes them underperform in tests and such. You can&#39;t say cultures that are often rampant in things like cannibalism or ritualistic sacrifice is not an inferior culture. So I don&#39;t think its a race that makes certain people inferior to westerners. But very interesting viewpoint, you sound just like my sociology professor.</p>

<p>I think time is also a factor. It hasn&#39;t been very long since the days of slavery and Jim Crowe. Also this group is much smaller and concentrated than &quot;all Europeans.&quot;</p>

<p>What makes you say the culture is inferior? I guess what I&#39;m asking is based on what standards?</p>

<p>From your post body, these two statements oppose each other greatly. </p>

<p>[Contrary to the belief that blacks are genetically predisposed to be more violent or mischievous, I believe there is sufficient data out there or at the least, enough so that a strong case can be made this is a case of nurture rather than nature.]</p>

<p>[Lastly, I will touch on intergenerational trauma and how it relates to blacks and their behaviors. 
Studies have consistently shown that an individual&#39;s experience can be encoded in their genes and be passed on to their progeny for multiple generations. This is verified in a relatively new field called Epigenetics.]</p>

<p>That said, I think it important to ask ourselves if pursuing this discussion is worth the effort. </p>

<p>What value would data that was able to prove any sort of significant difference between one ethnicity versus the other actually have for our society? If you could statistically prove that people of primarily middle-eastern descent have a higher IQ than those whose ancestry is primarily native american, what good would that do anyone in a country that isn&#39;t ethnically segregated? Likewise, would this data be considered when it came to criminal sentencing? I&#39;d hope not, because if we are willing to be lenient on people based on &quot;race&quot; people will start using that same argument to promote segregation and discrimination.</p>
