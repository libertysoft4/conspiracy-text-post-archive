<p>Beloved former Secretary of State/current advocate for sanity and democracy Hillary Rodham Clinton is like the final girl of American politics. No matter what sexist garbage gets thrown at her, she comes out stronger, with her ambition and belief in the promise of America unscathed, and she’s having a gracious, fierce second act as the author of What Happened, a supporter of emerging activists, and a Teen Vogue (!) guest editor. Bear witness.</p>

<p>are these people just unbelievably naive or, bought off?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe she should just go away like most other failed presidential contenders. But her hubris won&#39;t allow for that. Nor will her power hungry control of the DNC, nor her even more powerful donors.</p>

<p>I doubt she will run in 2020, but the fact that Kamala Harris met with HRC and her major donors in the Hampton&#39;s several times this summer, and has hired several of her former staff, should speak volumes about the place HRC still holds in the Corporatist Wing of the DNC. She does seem to be at odds with Obama&#39;s wing, however, which seems to be trying to coalesce around Deval Patrick.</p>

<p>I welcome their infighting, it gives us real Progressives a chance to take the Party from the ground up and launch a serious insurgency again come 2020. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you read my comment you just replied to, you would see how that&#39;s just not the case. HRC hasn&#39;t gone away because she doesn&#39;t <em>want</em> to, and still is playing politics within the DNC. That&#39;s why anyone concerned about a fair Primary, a Progressive Democratic Party, and cleaning house at the DNC is still concerned with HRC. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A friend of mine told me that she’s flying to Vancouver for a few days and I asked her why. She told me that she was going to a seminar given by Hillary Clinton. I laughed out loud and asked her why she would go and see her. She said that she was her hero and she has great respect for her. I looked at her and said well what about Benghazi?what about Libya? what about Haiti? What about her accosting Bills assault victims? She just looked at me and smiled and said I don’t care I really like her. Darrrrrr</p>
