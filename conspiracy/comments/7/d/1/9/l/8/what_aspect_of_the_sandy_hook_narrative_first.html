    <div class="md"><p>He says he didn&#39;t finish them all that day and he&#39;ll do them tomorrow, which is absurdly stupid. &quot;Dr&quot; Wayne Carver also could not say what the genders or ages of the victims were. He says each child was shot 3-11 times, and when asked where they were shot he said &quot;all over.&quot;</p>

<p>I show people his press conference right off the bat when explaining the Sandy Hook hoax, because it&#39;s really all you need since he is supposed to be the linchpin of the charade, an official-looking medical guy confirming that kids were shot, playing on people&#39;s imaginations, yet he does the exact opposite by betraying himself as a fraud with his goofy and ridiculous speech and bizarre behavior that unequivocally proves to anyone with an ounce of common sense that he is no doctor.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As a skeptic to the conspiracy side of Sandy Hook my main problem is that a whole lot of the conspiracy hinges on people being face blind as far as this person looks like this other person. Coupled with mostly just finding fault in how a given person is interviewed on camera. Grief does strange stuff to people and there is no right way to respond, there is only an expected way. </p>

<p>Also if they were going to false flag an event of this nature they would of gone balls out on the details, leaks, pics and soon. I&#39;m not saying I want to see dead kids, I don&#39;t, but there would of been way more impact like &quot;stuff&quot; released. Also the most telling of all, I mean the real bottom line here is nothing happened government wise. Why would they fake an event, go all false flag to this level if they didn&#39;t have the rest of the political agenda side of it ready to go? They were just going to wing that part of it?  They were willing to stage a huge fake whatever but did not have the rest of their ducks in a row? </p>

<p>What did we really get? Online petition, some executive orders that could of been done at any time Obama wanted to sign them. There was some legislation later on, but that was defeated anyways. So seriously, what the point of doing Sandy Hook in the first place, if one views it as false flag etc?!?! The entire point of a conspiracy is to go from A to B. No mater where one falls in their feeling on say 9/11 it CLEARLY took the country from A to B. Sandy Hook didn&#39;t move anything. They hardly even tried and that&#39;s why I highly doubt it was faked. </p>

This alone is a reasonable explanation for why it might have been done.</p>

<p>Either way, you&#39;re thinking about it the wrong way. You don&#39;t have to know why a crime was committed to know a crime has been committed. The evidence alone will tell you it was fake. We can speculate all day about why it was done, but the fact is that no one can demonstrate that any shots were fired or even that the school was operational at the time.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I few executive orders? Did not need an event for those to happen. Assault Weapon Ban of 2013? Failed and could not even muster full party support in the Senate. Universal background checks? Failed. A few states passed a couple meh level laws here or there, no where in line with the sort of stuff one might expect as a response to a bunch of dead kids. Others states, if I remember right, even lowered over all gun laws. I&#39;d argue we have more gun freedom now then before Sandy Hook. </p>

<p>Someone suggest to me a few posts above that maybe Sandy Hook had other goals. Ok, maybe but it&#39;s hardly even talked about anymore outside of being used against conspiracy theory people. Maybe that was the goal all along, I don&#39;t know. </p>

<p>very little of the conspiracy side of Sandy Hook is even close to being evidence. It&#39;s all conjecture, speculation and hearsay. They see a run down school and post pictures of if being ran down. They claim that shows it&#39;s a fake location being no school has those sort of maintenance problems. Meanwhile my local elementary school in a neighborhood of million dollar homes was flooding every winter due to bad drains. They were sandbagging doors, every winter, for years. No funding to fix it, like most other public schools. Even part of the roof was peeling off. It also had no play ground equipment for something like 15+ years. Removed the old tire based stuff being it was too risky while having no money for new equipment. That&#39;s just what happens at pubic school, unless it&#39;s Sandy Hook then it&#39;s &quot;evidence&quot; of the location being staged/fake. </p>

<p>Now to be fair, given where I&#39;m posting that&#39;s 100% ok. I would not be here if I did not like reading the idea and speculations of others towards certain events or actions. That doesn&#39;t in anyway make what is said evidence, at all. </p>

<p>A test run for how big of a hoax they could pull off and who would buy it and who wouldn&#39;t. Just a big ole social test. It certainly wasn&#39;t the first mass shooting, but I we&#39;ve seen a lot more mass shootings since that reek of false flag (don&#39;t have a specific source list to provide at the moment, but it would be easy to put one together).  </p>

<p>maybe, my problem with a lot of false flags claims is this sort of ubiquitous &quot;they&quot; with no clear political agenda or one that just sort of conveniently fits whatever narrative one wants to pitch. Even if the outcome of the event don&#39;t even come close to matching up with the agenda of those who are claimed to be behind it. I understand in a vacuum of factual information there is whole lot of room for flex. </p>

<p>yet given the easy nature of information flow nobody breaks ranks and blows up a false flag or conspiracy for their own gains at a future date? You have this thermal nuclear bomb level of revelation one could drop at anytime, but it just never happens. Where is the Edward Snowden like person for this or any claimed false flag? I mean any of them over the last decade plus of them being claimed. I honestly think it&#39;s just bad crap happening. Being again, nothing changes, no one ever comes forward and the news cycle moves on in about a month. </p>

<p>So what&#39;s the theory here? &quot;They&quot; just keep trying all these false flags even when none of them ever stick, they result in near zero changes and don&#39;t even stay in the news. I mean maybe, I don&#39;t think so it&#39;s not like I know for sure. Yet how do you have it both ways? How are the people behind the false flags such bumbling idiots that they keep doing them little to no effect on anything while also being so good at pulling them off in plain sight? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t disagree with you. I have struggled to figure out the motive and how so many could be involved. At the end, it seems like enough hush money and a few very public heads on pikes might keep participants in line.</p>

<p>But WHY. Is it a gun control long-game? Or, to sow deep feelings of danger and discontent even in the most idyllic wealthy areas, like Sandy Hook CT? Those both seem too broad and not directly affected--unless it really is a deep longterm conspiracy.</p>

<p>That&#39;s sort of how I arrived at the the &quot;it&#39;s a test&quot; theory.</p>

<p>Fixed that for you. A false flag is not necessarily a hoax. A hoax is a false flag. I can accept that many of the &quot;mass causality&quot; events we&#39;ve been presented with are false flags (which can include legitimate victims), but I specifically believe Sandy Hook was a hoax (there were no actual victims).</p>
