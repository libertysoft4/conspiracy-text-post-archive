<li><p>George HW Bush pretends to be an old kook who lost his mind and yet he’s still sane enough to put out hits on people like he did during the LV false flag. When the 5 recent presidents got together, he was acting like he was so far gone that he couldn’t even clap like an adult. </p></li>
<li><p>John McCain is sporting a wheel chair and claiming to have brain cancer. We have the cure for cancer so it’s not brain cancer. </p></li>
<li><p>The “Reverend” Jesse Jackson today claimed he has Parkinson’s Disease just hours after being outed as a sexual predator. He was probabaly sporting the title “Reverend” to mislead the good people of the world into thinking he was a good man that should be followed. Meanwhile, he led his followers into a cabal trap. He may just be a Reverend in the Church of Satan which would justify that title. </p></li>
<li><p>Pelosi is claiming to have Alzheimer’s and acting out of touch when cameras are around to trick people into thinking she’s losing it. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>This is getting ridiculous and reminds me of that movie where the criminal was found not guilty after tricking the whole court into thinking he was retarded. </p>

<p>These cowards are pulling the same stunt. It’s becoming some kind of fad. </p>

<p>I remember when them Clintinz were dripping their fluids all over the White house, the hag was recounting, to anyone who would listen, that she was named after Sir Edmund Percival Hillary of Mount Everest fame.</p>

<p>Then someone pointed out that when Hillbilly was spewed into the world, Sir Edmund was an obscure former Royal New Zealand PBY Flying Boat navigator who was back in New Zealand because of injuries. So Hillary&#39;s parents were big fans of <em>that</em> guy....😂😂</p>

    <div class="md"><p>1) he stopped funding ISIS..allegedly. He allegedly has attacked them. There is no actual evidence that they ever existed as anything other than an agency cut out group nor that their attacks are anything other than false flags. </p>

<p>2) North Korea is a wind up toy. They chirp when you need them and go quiet when you need them. </p>

<p>3) there is no mass roundup of pedos. There is no actual evidence of that. The 474 arrests in California was a routine prostitution sting. The vast majority of arrests were johns that were set up by the cops. They raided the nest and a small handful of the whores were 17. That’s it. There is no ring that was busted of prepubescent sex trafficking-none of that was touched...just regular johns wanting to fuck a 21 year old prostitute. Read the actual article and pay the fuck attention. </p>

<p>The bigger question is who gave the word to Burn all these pedos that are being burned now? Clearly it want Trump </p>

<p>4) refugees are still flooding into the country in most circuit court systems because the judges and government agencies are openly ignoring the executive order and Trump hasn’t had these judges arrested yet for insubordination - if he was legit he would have dealt with them swiftly and severely already but he hasn’t done shit. </p>

<p>Everything good he has done has been executive direction that can easily be undone by the next administration and likely will be.  He has yet to consolidate power and go for the jugular. If he had any balls he would have done it already but he is another puppet so he won’t. If anything he will start doing damage to the country now that the heat is on him. He will roll over like a bitch and continue the process of selling the country out. </p>

<p>Obama wasn’t great: he was a piece of shit traitor. So was Hilary and Bush and all the rest of them. Trump has done next to nothing to fix that. </p>
