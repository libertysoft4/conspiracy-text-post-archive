<p>It&#39;s that or pay their wages while they find a new job. What is the community around them going to do, with all these unemployed factory workers?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Are these revolutionary workers in stolen factories going to pay for 3 million tons of aluminum, 200,000 tons of copper and silicone chips to feed these stolen factories or are they going to just seize these required supplies too? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The payment comes from the renegotiated contracts from the demand that would have supported the overseas plant. Why were they moving the plant overseas, just to cut costs and hurt the worker? Nah, make the customer pay, a rise in value should be passed onto the workers. </p>

<p>Again, what is the community going to do with all these unemployed factory workers? What is the province/state going to do for their people? How does the nation provide them with something else, a new job stream? It&#39;s not just a problem for the worker, the neoliberal ideology leaves people behind, TPTB leave them to rot. How is a town to survive if its main economic driver leaves? Where do these supplies come from?</p>

<p>If they come from inside the state, then it should be less of a problem, outside, yeah a bit harder. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>And then the healthcare for these workers, are they going to kidnap the doctors and force them into slavery (damn academics!) To heal people?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These doctors are just going to leave town, all the other civillians who need them? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>And the food to feed the workers, forced labor there too? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I feel like you&#39;re confusing me for an Authoritarian Collectivist. But, no, I don&#39;t think the farmers should be forced, it should be in their interest to show solidarity with the factory workers. If not, well a state that will starve factory workers in a workplace occupation is evil.</p>

<p>You like evil states? Cruel countries that look at a workplace action and decide to murder them?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And the shit produced by all these well fed workers in paradise, who gets the job of mopping up shit puddles? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>IDK, diff workplaces have seniority roles, but also it can be a rotating job since no one wants it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Obviously what’s going on is elementary simple. By putting opposing views against one Ana other you guarantee that extremes on both ends will double down for their sheepish beliefs. After this, those more moderate voices will be left with the terrible choice of agreeing or going against what they view as their group. Obviously the easy route is compliance. Once the extremes and moderates have been involved their is nowhere noble for the WOKE crowd to dwell. As terrible as loud voices arguing a point are, there is clearly no platform for quite valid arguments at this point. </p>

<p>Is it even possible to create a party specifically for the middle ground fact-oriented group? I think practically no but do so hope it could happen. A government party that fights against stays quo first and foremost and then stays true to their beliefs no matter how much noise there will inevitably be from the soapbox mainstream media polar ends of the spectrum. As unlikely as it is, I would be proud to be a part of it and as the fallacy of pseudo important social media opinions is exposed more people could be enticed to join. An avalanche starts with a small slide but the unstoppable will of gravity inevitably picks up reinforcements and gathers momentum. This is how I see a change happening. With the founders expecting to be written off as pariahs but continuing to fight the good fight. </p>

<p>God bless, not the USA, but humanity and all that we can accomplish when righteous folks band together to create something which we all instinctively know is right. Join me, humans and let’s thrash and expose this poorly fabricated reality of “right and wrong.”</p>
