<hr/>

<p>It&#39;s one of those things that everyone would claim they already knew if it was openly revealed in the mainstream media.</p>

<p>Aside from the obvious fact that she looks like a <a href="http://www.theglamourouslife.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/wendy_williams_man_3.jpg">man</a> in <a href="http://cdn.twistity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/wendywilliamsgetsit2.png">drag</a>, she has big hands and her <a href="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/09/15/video-undefined-2163630300000578-282_636x358.jpg">ring finger is longer than her index finger</a> which indicates that she was exposed to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digit_ratio">high amount</a> of testosterone in the womb.</p>

<p>Not saying there&#39;s anything wrong with her being trans. Maybe when the establishment media decides the moment is right to focus on that agenda they&#39;ll make a big celebration of it and she&#39;ll talk about her nightmare of having to live a lie etc etc.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Nothing about my post disparaged Wendy Williams or trans people, but I was permabanned from <a href="/r/videos">/r/videos</a> for &quot;Hate speech&quot;.</p>

<p>The entire thread (and several others) were filled with hateful comments toward Williams, but you are not allowed to discuss why she looks like a man in drag.</p>

<p>Good old Corporeddit controlling the narrative....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t care either way, but it&#39;s at least as strong as any of your pieces of evidence.  The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digit_ratio#/media/File:Digit_ratio_visualization_according_to_data_from_Bailey_and_Hurd,_2005.png">vast majority of women</a> have a 2d:4d ratio that is &lt;1 and ~5% of women have a ratio &lt;.912, so the fact that hers is like that doesn&#39;t mean much.

<p>A single photo from a supposed nine month pregnancy of what could extremely easily be a prosthetic is not &quot;at least as strong&quot; as anything, or even slightly approaching evidence of anything.</p>

<p>If I showed you a picture of a cow with 20 legs would you consider it to be reasonable evidence of anything? Are you aware how amazingly easy it is to manipulate photos these days?</p>

<p>But her ring finger is longer than her index finger, not shorter, which is in line with the vast majority of males, not females.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Did you zoom in on the first picture I posted that shows extremely obvious signs of stubble growth?</p>

<p>Ultimately I think it&#39;s perfectly reasonable to discuss whether Wendy Williams was born a man, and that Reddit is forcefully preventing this discussing.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a conspiracy against me personally.

<p>People are allowed to openly discuss whether or not celebrities are gay on Reddit. Can you please take the time to explain why such discussion is not allowed concerning people who show signs of being transgender?</p>

<p>It&#39;s pretty clear that you have a problem with trans people. If you didn&#39;t think there was anything wrong with it you wouldn&#39;t have put so much effort into &quot;proving&quot; that she&#39;s trans.</p>

<p>I couldn&#39;t care less about convincing anyone. I simply provided the evidence that convinced me. People are absolutely entitled to draw their own conclusions.</p>

<p>As far as I&#39;m concerned, it&#39;s plainly obvious that she was born male. It&#39;s not a matter of &quot;why I care&quot;. People constantly openly discuss whether or not celebrities are gay and I don&#39;t see this as being any different.</p>
