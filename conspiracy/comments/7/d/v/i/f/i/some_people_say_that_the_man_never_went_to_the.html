    <div class="md"><p>When you listen to Don Petit talk about how the technology was destroyed to get back to the Moon, it makes one wonder how they ever chose him as a spokesperson in the first place.</p>

<p>Petit did his Rocket payload chalkboard talk and you pause to think there&#39;s gotta be some strange agenda afoot. Dude is a strange duck and why him as a spokesman? </p>

<p>Another astronaut was asked recently about the Air Bubbles that were seen in footage of a &quot;space walk&quot; and he said it might have been sweat. What? How does sweat escape an airtight suit? </p>

<p>While the NASA Fan Club will come in and defend the millions per day given to ISS as a mere <em>drop</em> in the Federal Budget compared to Military etc. I&#39;ll still argue this is a fast 52 Million per Day that could improve schools, the VA, our Medicare problem, bridges and roads - do the Math.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well there ya go eh. Learn something new everyday. So it seems they&#39;ve given us a floating microphone, a real life best ever space invader ship that has dodged space junk for years, all whilst seemingly looking as robust as some glued matchsticks and aluminum foil. </p>

<p>Some may argue the value of tax payers money for such things or a lack thereof but the best is yet to come....NASA hairspray. Thanks to years of testing and the consistent always erect wild hair cuts of the female ISS participants.</p>

<p>Best BILLIONS spent ever. Said quite possibly no one outside of NASA ever.</p>
