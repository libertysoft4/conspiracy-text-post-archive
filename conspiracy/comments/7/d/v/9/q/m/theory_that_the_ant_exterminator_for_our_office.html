        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Our breakroom has this little crack that ants started to come through a couple weeks ago, not surprisingly, the floor was hardly ever vacuumed and the people I work with don&#39;t seem to give a shit about crumbs after they fall on the floor (cue Malory Archer ants quote).  </p>

<p>So, we got an ant removal company to come and place some traps that the workers eat, take to their queen and eventually they all die.  I also put up an anonymous sign in the break room saying &quot;The ant guy says to keep the ants out keep this area clean and clear!&quot; and I was really happy to see after a week or so it was looking much cleaner, not only that but almost all the ants were gone!  After another week (and the guy came to refill the traps) we hadnt seen any, so we called to let them know we wouldnt be needing their servicing anymore.  They said they had to come by one last time and fill up the traps again &quot;just to be sure&quot;.</p>

<p>Lo and behold three days later and ants are marching out of that hole again, despite the fact that the breakroom is still clean as ever!  We had to call them back and get more traps set up, the guy placing them around the office told me &quot;you wouldnt believe how many people call us a couple weeks after we finish our service!&quot;  </p>

<p>I&#39;m sure ants come back for some reason.  But I have this thought in the back of my head saying &quot;Ill bet whenever someone cancels their service with them, and they do that &#39;last trap to be safe&#39; it some sort of ant magnet so people will have to call back and pay more&quot;.  </p>

<p>Obviously not a huge conspiracy or anything, everyone in the office says it&#39;s a stupid theory (I agree, but I can&#39;t change how I think).  Anybody else have a &#39;local&#39; conspiracy theory?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting, these days anything is possible. My local story is the perfectly good roads being repaved all the time in our town. The rumor is that the guy who makes the repair decisions for the county is good friends with a local road builder. The waste of tax money makes me sick when we are struggling to pay our ridiculously high property taxes. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting!  That would be annoying especially with construction! (But I do love that feeling when your car goes from old road to freshly paved, smooth as butter).  Weird they would keep <em>re</em>paving the same road though...have you asked any of the workers if they&#39;re tired redoing their work for no benefit?  If you have any town hall meetings you should bring it up, I&#39;m sure people would be very interested to hear that! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My high school did a raffle where you payed for tickets for a attempt to make a half court shot. Never cared about it. Then my senior year I&#39;m sitting with a friend that graduated( a liked former basketball player) when the principal walks up hands him the winning ticket and whispers in his ear. Sure enough his ticket is announced. All of this money they make every game I wonder where that money goes?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Waste is rampant, buildings that don&#39;t need painting will still get painted so they use their budget for the year.  Or else they won&#39;t get the same amount of budget next year. THey want to keep spending so they get more and more money. Remove the property taxes, give people an option as to where their taxes go. </p>

<p>Transparency in all government work project is a must. No more government contracts. Set it up so the bidding process is open to the public and we can see all break downs of the bid. Quit hiring out of state contractors to do local bids. </p>

<p>More questions to look into, where does your energy come from? Is it a business that is owned by an overseas entity? IF so why? Do you have more than one option in your town to get power? Why are so many regulations put into place to hinder the process to be self sufficient. </p>

Nothing wrong with skepticism, and I especially agree about the transparency part, I wish all construction and public works had signs <a href="https://www.meetalex.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/rhode-island-image-1-copy.png">like this one</a> so we arent just kept in the dark about things.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Possibly true, this guy is placing the ants, i mean it saves him his job eventually and brings some money.</p>

<p>But what has this to do with conspiracy, do you mean the deep state and CIA is involved? Do the ants wear small cams on them? Do they contact the NASA?</p>

<p>I would rather call this a case of corruption or economic fraud but not a conspiracy at all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Go get some food grade diatomaceous earth (DE) and a duster. Use the duster to blow DE into the cracks. You probably won&#39;t need chemicals. </p>

<p>DE dries out the ants -- kills&#39;em. You won&#39;t need the shady ant guy anymore. </p>

<p>I suggest food grade because this stuff is good for your health, too. </p>

<p>Put some in a beverage or in oatmeal. Kills parasites (by slicing them to bits) and helps build bone and improve skin (high silica). Also improves energy.</p>

<p>It&#39;s cheap. It&#39;s effective. </p>

<p>Best of luck. </p>
