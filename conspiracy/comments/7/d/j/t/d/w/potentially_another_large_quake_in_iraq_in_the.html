<p>Coming down from the last 700+Km/s Windstream on the 12th. With a minor (G1) geomagnetic storm watch is in effect for the next several hours as an elevated solar wind stream moves past our planet. High latitude sky watchers should be alert for visible aurora.</p>

Valid To: 2017 Nov 16 1200 UTC
Warning Condition: Onset
NOAA Scale: G1 - Minor</p>

<p><strong>I am expecting to see another aftershock from the:</strong> <a href="https://earthquaketrack.com/quakes/2017-11-12-18-18-17-utc-7-3-19"><em>11/12</em> <strong>7.3</strong> in Ḩalabjah, As Sulaymānīyah, Iraq</a></p>

<p><em>Just my thoughts- Not many aftershocks of high magnitude there, but the activity could also move somewhere else. I haven&#39;t been on the board lately</em>- </p>

    <div class="md"><p>ParsingSol, Fist off I love you and everything you do. The amount of effort you put into your research and theory is amazing and very interesting to me personally. I will continue to look forward to your threads and conversation as I believe it&#39;s people like you that make the &quot;conspiracy&quot; world wonderful!</p>

<p>But having said that -I&#39;m having a really hard time believing in to this now since the last few have been duds. I really really want you to show me proof of your system predictions working and I do understand that with most things in science - it&#39;s a work in progress that&#39;s constantly changing, adapting ect, I&#39;m just having a hard time (personally) putting faith into your methods recently.</p>

<p>With that said I am 100% rooting for you and your incredibly interesting &quot;reads&quot; (Shall we call it? Saying prediction seems to trigger people recently on your posts). Please never stop posting here or on your sub. It&#39;s never, not a interesting read and switch up from the normal stuff we&#39;ve been being brigaded with recently and I fully want you to win!</p>

<p>TL;DR - Keep doing you ParsingSoul. I love every bit of it, even if it falls flat some times.</p>

I am working really really hard at the moment to create some OC, in hopes to appease Past performance. I found more resources recently, which I&#39;ve been utilizing as fast as I can in hopes to at least give users something hard to chew on. </p>

<p>This should be a pretty good event though, as I literally have been reviewing data 48 hours straight; So I just wanted to address the breach, before getting back into my current manner of focus. </p>

<p>IDK, Don&#39;t want doom, just seemed like a large pulse with limited release, so we will see in time :)</p>

<p>There is none:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/grl.50211/full">...some advocates of hypotheses in which solar-terrestrial interaction does actually trigger earthquakes have reported the identification of different types of correlations of possible relevance. Before such claims can be regarded as valid, advocates need to demonstrate the statistical significance of their correlations in objectively chosen historical data sets. To guard against inspection and selection biases, advocates of solar-terrestrial triggering of earthquakes also need to demonstrate the persistence and statistical significance of their claimed correlations against future data. This has not been done. And until it is, the hypothesis that solar-terrestrial interaction can trigger earthquakes must be regarded with significant skepticism.</a></li>

    <div class="md"><p>I have an idea for predicting earthquakes, which might seem crazy but if someone could try it who has the skills and resources, it&#39;d be interesting. </p>

<p>So, there are several theories that suggest animals, including dogs, can sense when an earthquake is about to occur. I wondered if it would be possible to see from looking back at past earthquakes, whether you can use social media data from people talking about their dogs going crazy to predict them. So for example, to see how often in general there are tweets in a given area that mention a dog going crazy, and then see whether there is a spike in the number of such tweets just before an earthquake happens in that area. Then if you were able to establish such a pattern from looking at past data, you could then maybe develop a model that would use current tweets (or other social media posts) to predict new earthquakes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Something you&#39;re forgetting is control. Dogs and cats can act weird the day of an earthquake but it could be to a different cause. Way too many variables at play there. I could see this experiment working if you monitor pet shelters in a certain area. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your enthusiasm and interest in earthquakes is commendable and please continue to seek out and test your hypotheses in an analytical way.</p>

<p>When a fault slips and an earthquake occurs, the fastest traveling and first arriving waves it generates are P waves that are often too high frequency (~1 Hz) and small in amplitude for humans to detect. Animals like dogs and cats can detect them and often have some reaction to it, barking or running around in an odd manner that confuses their human-friends who did not feel anything. While the human is wondering what on earth their animal is freaking out about, the slower and much larger amplitude surface waves arrive. These are the potentially damaging waves that shake houses and knock things over. To the human it looks like their dog was warning them about the impending surface waves, but really they were just reacting to the first arriving P waves and wondering why YOU weren&#39;t doing anything. The &quot;warning&quot; time, or time in between the P waves that cause the dog to bark and the surface waves, is longer depending on how far you both are from where the earthquake occurred.</p>

<p>So why doesn&#39;t USGS have an army of golden retrievers to detect P waves? Well, our seismometers are far more sensitive and reliable (but less adorable). Detecting the P waves on seismic stations and then sending a warning to people of the incoming surface waves of an earthquake is exactly what we are trying to incorporate in the United States, and we call it Earthquake Early Warning. It isn&#39;t predicting earthquakes, it is just allowing us to react more quickly to earthquakes when they occur. Countries like Japan and Mexico already have this kind of warning set up to give people an alarm on their phone and a few seconds to get under a table before everything starts shaking. Hopefully we will have it in the United States soon, but the funding for it has already been under threat in Congress.</p>
