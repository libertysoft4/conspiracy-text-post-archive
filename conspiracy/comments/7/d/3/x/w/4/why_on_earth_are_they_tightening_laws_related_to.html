        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Sorry, the post is a little long, but please bear with me (it took me a hell of a long time to compile) :</p>

<p>-<a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-40056680">In Germany you will be fined 2500 euros if you refuse to vaccinate your child</a>.</p>

<p>-In Italy, they mandated 12 vaccines. And they went much further than other countries with chasing parents who do not vaccinate their child. Parents can be sued at a court of law, fined, and may be taken their child away for negligence. Unvaccinated kids won&#39;t be allowed in childcare AND at school.</p>

<p>-In France, as soon as she was appointed minister of health in May 2017, Agnes Buzyn announced 11 vaccines would be made mandatory by law for all children.
The words of this new French minister of health :</p>

<blockquote>
<p>25 000 cases of measles since 2008, and 10 deaths.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That means measles has killed on average, in France : 1 person per year, out of about 70 million people and 800 000 new born, for the past 10 years. She estimates that mandating these 11 vaccines for everyone is going to cost the taxpayer 20 million euros. It&#39;s her estimation, so it may actually be a lot more than that.</p>

<p>-<a href="http://www.sb277.org/">In California, unvaccinated kids will lose their constitutional right for a school education. They won&#39;t be allowed in child care either</a></p>

<p>-<a href="https://www.9news.com.au/national/2017/11/15/07/10/victorian-anti-vaxxers-won-t-be-allowed-to-enrol-kids-in-school-under-new-laws">Today, I read that the state of Victoria in Australia tightened the vaccination laws, and won&#39;t allow unvaccinated kids in childcare</a></p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herd_immunity#Mechanism">This wikipedia source here states that herd immunity for measles is reached when 92-95% of a population is vaccinated</a>. (Whether you believe in the herd immunity story or not is not the point here). The MSM source above states that 95% of kids are vaccinated in the state of Victoria in Australia. It looks to me like they have already reached herd immunity. So, why on Earth do they need to tighten the laws ? Moreover, there has not been any major outbreak recently. There hasn&#39;t been any in the above listed countries and states either, as you will see further down.  </p>

<p>All sources (the MSM) that mention the number of people that measles kills, they usually do it with a very dramatic tone, conveniently omit to mention the detailed circumstances. </p>

<p>So, here is what the WHO (is there any more official source of data?) explicitly states : </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Severe measles is more likely among poorly nourished young children, especially those with insufficient vitamin A, or whose immune systems have been weakened by HIV/AIDS or other diseases. In populations with high levels of malnutrition, particularly vitamin A deficiency, and a lack of adequate health care, about 3–6%, of measles cases result in death. Most measles-related deaths are caused by complications associated with the disease</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In a nutshell, in some rare cases, and due to specific circumstances, measles will lead to complications, such as encephalitis and death. Hold on. Read again : people die from the complications that follow the contraction of measles. People do not die from measles itself. Complications will affect people who already have a compromised immune system (such as HIV). In the vast majority of cases, you will do just fine after contracting measles. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>In 2016, there were 89 780 measles deaths globally</p>

<p>Measles is still common in many developing countries – particularly in parts of Africa and Asia. <a href="http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs286/en/">The <strong>overwhelming majority (more than 95%)</strong> of measles deaths occur in countries with low per capita incomes and weak health infrastructures. Measles outbreaks can be particularly deadly in countries experiencing or recovering from a natural disaster or conflict</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you look at the global number, it may look scary. But this is happening in <strong>the least developed parts of the world</strong>. The parts of the world with <strong>poor hygiene</strong> and <strong>malnutrition</strong>. This is not happening in developed countries.</p>

<p>Now, to understand what the number of deaths due to measles means, you may want to put that into perspective. Looking at the global list of deaths by cause is meaningless, because as I said above, some parts of the world suffer from poor hygiene and malnutrition, so let&#39;s look at the data of a developed country (namely the UK), shall we ?</p>

<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2011/jan/14/mortality-statistics-causes-death-england-wales-2009">Here is a list of all causes of deaths in 2009 in England and Wales</a>.</p>

<p>-159,779 people died from circulatory diseases</p>

<p>-140,497 people died from cancer</p>

<p>.....</p>

<p>-18 people fell from cliff</p>

<p>-5 people died after being bitten by a dog</p>

<p>-4 died following contact with wasps or bees</p>

<p>-1 died after being struck by lightning</p>

<p>There are in average as many people who die of measles in a year in the UK, as people who are victims of lightning. And 4x more people die after being stung by honey bees.</p>

<p>The average number of people who die from measles in a year, compared with other causes of deaths, is ridiculously low. It&#39;s close to zero. In fact, on a chart of the number of deaths per cause, you would not be able to see it.</p>

<p>This trend is virtually the same in all developed countries :</p>

<p><a href="https://www.naturalnews.com/048573_measles_deaths_MMR_vaccine_immunization_dangers.html">This source says There have been no measles deaths reported in the U.S. since 2003</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.verywell.com/measles-deaths-2633851">This pro-vaccine source says there has been 8 deaths due to measles in the US since 2003</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/measles-deaths-by-age-group-from-1980-to-2013-ons-data/measles-deaths-by-age-group-from-1980-to-2013-ons-data">This official source reports 7 deaths due to measles in the UK since 2008, all 15 years and older BTW</a></p>

<p>Basically, all developed countries, on average, have one death per year due to complications associated with the measles disease. Now, you could say : &quot;we could do a little better and avoid that one death&quot;. To which I would reply : &quot;well, maybe we could not avoid that death with a vaccine&quot;. As I said, with the WHO source I mentioned, children who die of the complications associated with measles are malnourished (vit A deficiency) and have a poor hygiene to start with. There is no evidence that vaccinating that one child would have helped.  </p>

<p><strong>Now, here is where I&#39;m getting at :</strong> </p>

<p>Why are they going so far with vaccine laws, which cost a fortune to the taxpayer, for a disease responsible for 1 (not hundreds, not ten, but ONE!) death per year, on average in developed countries, and which does not involve complications among people with a good hygiene anyway ?</p>

<p>And here is my theory, which falls well into this conspiracy sub : this whole vaccination agenda is based on lies. And today, they (big pharma) have gone too far with the lies to even think of going back. There is no going back. Big pharma companies are driven by profit, and here they identified a business opportunity. Whether it is with the sale of vaccines or with the sale of drugs they are gonna make to vaccinated kids who got the side effects, they found out they would make tons of money. In that context, they just cannot afford leaving anyone with the benefit of the doubt. They cannot afford to have unvaccinated people say &quot;hey look, I was not vaccinated, and here I am today, a healthy adult. Never been sick. Are vaccines really necessary?&quot;. They have to get 100%, not 99.9%, vaccinated. And they do have the financial power to get their agenda going. According to a professor of medicine I listened to, taken altogether, big pharma&#39;s marketing budget is of $200 billion per year. </p>

<p>This also means that governments, which make these illegitimate laws, are either corrupt, or supplied with wrong data.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How Much US Pediatricians Make From Vaccines</p>

<p>&quot;So how much money do doctors really make from vaccines? The average American pediatrician has 1546 patients, though some pediatricians see many more. The vast majority of those patients are very young, perhaps because children transition to a family physician or stop visiting the doctor at all as they grow up. As they table above explains, Blue Cross Blue Shield pays pediatricians $400 per fully vaccinated child. If your pediatrician has just 100 fully-vaccinated patients turning 2 this year, that’s $40,000. Yes, Blue Cross Blue Shield pays your doctor a $40,000 bonus for fully vaccinating 100 patients under the age of 2. If your doctor manages to fully vaccinate 200 patients, that bonus jumps to $80,000. V But here’s the catch: Under Blue Cross Blue Shield’s rules, pediatricians lose the whole bonus unless at least 63% of patients are fully vaccinated, and that includes the flu vaccine. So it’s not just $400 on your child’s head–it could be the whole bonus. To your doctor, your decision to vaccinate your child might be worth $40,000, or much more, depending on the size of his or her practice.</p>

<p>If your pediatrician recommends that your child under the age of 2 receive the flu vaccine–even though the flu vaccine has never been studied in very young children and evidence suggests that the flu vaccine actually weakens a person’s immune system over the long term–ask yourself: Is my doctor more concerned with selling me vaccines to keep my child healthy or to send his child to private school?&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It appears that the vaccine regimen has been successful. Herd immunity is a critical threshold. It&#39;s the difference between porous and non-porous rock. Non-porous rock can have holes in it, but as long as the holes aren&#39;t too big or numerous, then they aren&#39;t connected to each other, and liquids won&#39;t spread through them. If, however, the average number of holes goes up by even a little bit, it can make the rock porous, and now the measles can spread as an epidemic through the entire population of people who aren&#39;t currently protected by the vaccine. Maintaining herd immunity is important, because not everyone can be vaccinated, and they don&#39;t always <em>work</em> for some individuals.</p>

<p>OP is saying there&#39;s few deaths so why is it a big deal... there&#39;s few deaths <em>because</em> of vaccines. Rates for diseases like rubella and diptheria, etc. were much higher before we started vaccinating.</p>

<p>Even if some of these diseases don&#39;t kill people, certain ones like polio can cripple kids for life.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Vaccines are big business. There are 100&#39;s of them in development. Look at a vaccine schedule in the 70&#39;s for example, and look at it now.  Think about it. At birth, at 2 months, at 4 months, at 6 months and at a year, kids get vaccinated. That&#39;s just in the first YEAR. By 6 years they will have gotten as many as 49 doses of 14 different vaccines. And that&#39;s nearly every kid in every developed country. Then there&#39;s boosters that are &quot;required&quot; throughout a person&#39;s life, since of course no vaccine gives permanent immunity to anything. Then there&#39;s flu shots which if course you just NEED every single year. If anyone tries to tell you it&#39;s not about money, they&#39;re brainwashed or a shill. There&#39;s no such thing as a free lunch. Those vaccines are bought from pharma manufacturers. Each and every one. There not giving them away for free. </p>

<p>They&#39;re worthless unless you&#39;re elderly. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fun fact : my father in law came and visit me and my (pregnant) wife. To be &quot;safe&quot;, he did the flu shot before flying. The day he landed he got sick. Next thing I know, both me and my wife are down for 2 weeks with a bad flu. 2 weeks that we both spent lying on the damn bed, doing nothing. I never took the flu vaccine in my life, and I also don&#39;t remember ever getting such bad flu. Once again, her dad took the flu shot before visiting us!</p>

<p>He had good intentions, but ended up putting the foetus at risk with the flu vaccine crap. I was very upset.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know about your country, but here in Australia, all medical practice have that big poster on the wall, or that large A-frame at the front door promoting &quot;free flu vaccines&quot;. Nothing is free in my world. So what price do you actually pay when you take this &quot;free&quot; shot ? </p>

<p>I didn&#39;t die from flu. Very most people don&#39;t. Now, look again at the link I provided in my OP with the number of deaths by cause. Cancer tops the list. If they are so concerned with people&#39;s health, why do they not give free cancer medication then ? It looks to me like cancer does many many more victims that fucking flu.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As I have mentioned previously there word eradicate can be within local, regional or geographic contexts.  But say it&#39;s just one that is completely eradicated and dozens of other&#39;s dramatically reduced, it&#39;s thousands of lives saved which is the number that no one here seems willing to dispute.</p>

<p>The lives are the concern.  Go watch videos of kids with whooping cough or measles or any of the other diseases you have never seen with your own eyes. I have a clue mate... Perhaps you should get some perspective, and a clue if your own.  Stop letting paranoia make you take stupid unnecessary risks with your children and the lives of others.</p>

<p>Even If there is an extremely minor risk of complications, which there are with any medical procedure, the risk is worth the reward in announce of needless suffering and death for your children and those of others, so if you must view it as you would a draft.... If I were drafted I would hate it but I would go none the less because no one else is going to die in my place because I didn&#39;t want to answer the call.</p>

<p>Vaccines aren&#39;t blameless.  They can maim and they can kill.  Saying vaccine science shouldn&#39;t be scrutinized, questioned, or reexamined despite thousands of vaccine damaged children because it &quot;saves lives&quot; is ridiculous.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t doubt that vaccines have saved lives.</p>

<p>The problem is, they take lives too, and we CANNOT continue to ignore this just because of the good they can do.  The pharm companies want this ignored only because it hurts their bottom line.</p>

<p>It&#39;s been publicly shown that once you vaccinate a population you lose the latent protection that the population used to have. All the people born before these modern vaccines are dead or close to it. Therefore, the population is <em>massively</em> more vulnerable than it was before vaccinations began. </p>

<p>Therefore, you need to increase the pressure to vaccinate. You also need to counter-act the pressure of the anti-science, anti-vaccine crowd. </p>

<p>No they&#39;re not, and no they&#39;re not. </p>

<p>My main point is this. Is it in our best interest to grant unscrupulous companies a monopoly, while they also have the ability to use their regulatory capture to push for more vaccines and more stringent laws to cause people to take them?</p>

<p>Should we use coercive methods to get those last few people, even though in all the outbreaks the CDC has found, there has ben no mortality?</p>

<p>I would not. They can stay home and have their friendly neighborhood chicken pox party circlejerk or whatever. They just <em>also</em> choose to not patronize public services at the same time.

<p>Maybe people don&#39;t want unvaccinated kids in schools because vaccines are a resistance booster and not an impenetrable disease shield. </p>

<p>Research is being done on vaccines which is awesome, more data = more knowledge.

<p>What if we stop giving vaccines and visitors from other regions of the world bring it over? Not trying to be xenophobic, but it seems like your post is framed around a situation where people grow an immunity and are locked in the glass box of their borders with no one coming in or out.</p>

<p>&quot;vaccine  shedding  also  enables  community  transmission.  Up  to  90%  of  infants  shed  OPV  after  vaccination and  can  spread  OPV  to  their  household  contacts.  A  few  pub lished studies have assessed shedding by healthy adult contacts of  OPV  recipients,  but  most  of  these  studies  were  limited  to  8  weeks  after  vaccination,  possibly  missing  transmissions  that  occurred later &quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Furthermore, while India has been polio-free for a year, there has been a huge increase in non-polio acute flaccid paralysis (NPAFP). In 2011, there were an extra 47,500 new cases of NPAFP. Clinically indistinguishable from polio paralysis but twice as deadly, the incidence of NPAFP was directly proportional to doses of oral polio received. Though this data was collected within the polio surveillance system, it was not investigated. The principle of primum-non-nocere was violated. The authors suggest that the huge bill of US$ 8 billion spent on the programme, is a small sum to pay if the world learns to be wary of such vertical programmes in the future.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You do realize polio vaccines were found to be cancer causing and had a whole range of issues with them..?</p>

<p>&quot;
Both Sabin’s live virus vaccine given orally and Salk’s inactivated virus vaccine given by injection were far from perfect. In fact, in 1955 the vaccine used in Berkley, California infected some 200 children, leaving several dead and many paralyzed. Yet this incident proved minor compared to what was later discovered.</p>

<p>In order to grow large quantities of the poliovirus, scientists needed to use Rhesus monkey kidney cells, which carried many different viruses. As a result, their polio vaccine became contaminated with a cancer-causing virus carried by these monkeys. This vaccine was given to almost 100 million people.</p>

<p>The virus found in this particular polio vaccine was SV40, or simian virus. It is present in human tumors, and research has established it to be a contributing factor in the rise of many types of cancer, including mesothelioma, bone, and brain cancer.</p>

<p>When the government became aware of this, it was downplayed for fear the public would stop accepting vaccination.</p>

<p>TTAC - Polio Vaccine 
Can the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) Be Trusted?</p>

<p>At one point, the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) admitted on its website that the polio vaccine had been contaminated. They later removed this information. (View a snapshot of this removed page at the link below.)</p>

<p>The original report disclosed that more than 98 million Americans received the contaminated vaccine between 1955 and 1963, and explained that SV40 could lead to certain types of cancer. Later this admission was downplayed to state that there was no proof the virus caused the cancers, and since not all doses of the vaccine were contaminated, an estimated 10 to 30 million Americans were all who were at risk.</p>

<p>Just saying maybe the reason there&#39;s only one death a year in a developed country like the UK is cause most people vaccinate their kids.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Maybe. Or maybe not. Again, the WHO specifically mention parts of the world where children are malnurished and have a poor hygiene. You don&#39;t see that in the UK, or other developed countries.</p>

<p>If they reach &quot;herd immunity&quot; with the official recommendations to parents, why do they need to go further with this tyranny ? (no childcare, no school, heavy fines, no family tax benefits, mandatory vaccinations).</p>

<p>Like I said, all these laws tightening happen while there are no reported case of outbreaks. You would tell me : an outbreak already killed 1000 folks, and it seems to be spreading, I would understand. But that&#39;s not the case.</p>

<p><a href="http://whale.to/m/measlesdeaths1.html">And, well, you probably know of this chart here</a>, which suggests that measles vaccine has little to do with the mortality drop. It&#39;s not made up. I&#39;ve once seen this same chart on some official website (something dot gov).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What if we stop giving vaccines and visitors from other regions of the world bring it over?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>oh wow, look! It&#39;s is almost like this is what is happening in Europe atm.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gatestoneinstitute.org/6838/germany-migration-health-crisis">The influx of more than one million asylum seekers from Africa, Asia and the Middle East is placing unprecedented strain on Germany&#39;s healthcare system. Diseases are also reappearing that have not been seen in Germany for years.

<p>The migration paths are well-known. Yet, the migrants are never even quarantined. Common sense says they should be quarantined before being let free in European territory. Explain me this : why are the migrants allowed in with their middle age diseases (some with stronger forms of the known virus, and against which the vaccines are ineffective), while they are chasing all the bad bad bad local parents who don&#39;t vaccinate their healthy child ?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Boom! Headshot! When you put real life NUMBERS into perspective, you get a totally different story on vaccinations. You can prove anything with numbers (as most will say), unfortunately most people blindly follow the CDC or WHO numbers regurgitated through the Media to prove their points. </p>

<p>But if you dig deeper, you see a much bigger picture, most involve the Vaccine manufacturers bottom line. Also think about this, if you can make it mandatory for a COUNTRY to purchase 100% of your product every year, how much do you think that is worth? Millions or Billions? Also, look at the number of vaccines that were required in 1930&#39;s compared to how many are required today in America! It is mind blowing.</p>

<p>Great job connecting dots, you might start seeing some push back one word gets around you are making great points about how stupid MANDATORY vaccinations are. Good job.</p>

<p>&quot;vaccine  shedding  also  enables  community  transmission.  Up  to  90%  of  infants  shed  OPV  after  vaccination and  can  spread  OPV  to  their  household  contacts.  A  few  pub lished studies have assessed shedding by healthy adult contacts of  OPV  recipients,  but  most  of  these  studies  were  limited  to  8  weeks  after  vaccination,  possibly  missing  transmissions  that  occurred later &quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Furthermore, while India has been polio-free for a year, there has been a huge increase in non-polio acute flaccid paralysis (NPAFP). In 2011, there were an extra 47,500 new cases of NPAFP. Clinically indistinguishable from polio paralysis but twice as deadly, the incidence of NPAFP was directly proportional to doses of oral polio received. Though this data was collected within the polio surveillance system, it was not investigated. The principle of primum-non-nocere was violated. The authors suggest that the huge bill of US$ 8 billion spent on the programme, is a small sum to pay if the world learns to be wary of such vertical programmes in the future.&quot;</p>

<p>If a vaccine prevents a particular disease what sort of a threat does any child not vaccinated against that disease represent to those that have all been vaccinated against it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No vaccine is 100% effective. All people have different bodies and the immune reaction can&#39;t be perfectly predicted. So for some people, the vaccine won&#39;t take, for some it&#39;s protection may wear off.</p>

<p>For instance, the MMR vaccine, at two doses is only 97% effective. </p>

<p>Then you&#39;ve got people who can&#39;t be vaccinated. People with compromised immune systems from other diseases and health issues.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>There are some finer points involved that could be their own discussion. I&#39;ll just leave one point here. Measles deaths used to be a serious issue before the vaccine was introduced. Whether or not you would classify the children that died of the disease as &quot;normal&quot;, measles was a killer.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Is the level of trust in the vaccine&#39;s efficacy really that low? Are they that desperate to hide it that they&#39;re going to such lengths to make sure there&#39;s no unvaccinated children who&#39;s health can be compared to those that have been?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, there are pretty good numbers published on vaccine effectiveness. No hiding involved, publicly available. They&#39;re imperfect, but vaccines along with the benefit of herd immunity has been wiping out diseases worldwide and saving lives for a long time now.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Is any disease in question really all that life threatening, known to cause permanent damage, or even likely to be encountered in someone lifetime</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes to all three. And the more that anti-vaccination stances increase, the more likely people will be to encounter it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Most diseases also have other vectors of infection besides humans simply transmitting them to each other. They live and grow in various unsanitary and unhealthy environments and can be carried by air, water, insects, or animals or get into the human food chain with the same or an ever greater likelihood of spreading that way than humans themselves can spread them in some cases.
That particular threat doesn&#39;t change one iota so in essence the real problem of completely avoiding any encounter at all isn&#39;t actually resolved or even greatly diminished by insisting that absolutely every child be vaccinated.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Virus&#39;s like the one that causes the measles evolve to target particular hosts. While many are flexible and can cross hosts or lie dormant to some extent, their most effective path to multiply and spread is through their hosts. Their best route to mutate and become more dangerous is also through infecting more hosts.</p>

<p>At best here, you&#39;re making a utopian argument &quot;If vaccines don&#39;t offer perfect protection, why bother&quot;. The perfect is the enemy of the good. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>We agree on this. So please explain me why they inject a one-size-fits-all vaccine into every person ? The reason why you consult a doctor when you&#39;re sick, versus consult a spreadsheet with the list of diseases, is that your doctor is qualified to make a proper diagnostic based on things such as your gender, your age, your health condition, your medical record. Given the same disease, a healthy 15 yo boy won&#39;t be prescribed the same treatment as an 80 yo woman.</p>

<p>With vaccines however, there seems to be this new theory that everyone is the same.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Then you&#39;ve got people who can&#39;t be vaccinated. People with compromised immune systems from other diseases and health issues.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I see that statement ALL THE TIME. Now, can you elaborate a little, with data and stuff ? Are we talking 1 in 10 kids, or more like 1 in a million ? How compromised is their immune system ? If the person&#39;s immune system is that compromised, that person may actually be stuck at home all day, in a wheel chair or something. It&#39;s sad for that one guy, but Nature does not make us all supermen. Most of us are born healthy, a few of us are not. That one guy may not catch measles, but with a seriously compromised immune system, he is likely to die of something else sooner rather than later. My point is there is little that could be done for that one guy either way.</p>

<p>For a vaccinated child, none. But those aren&#39;t the problem. You Anti-Vaxxers always ignore thise kids that can&#39;t get immunized because they have a genetic disorder, a auto immune disorder, a allergy against something in the vaccine, etc.. These kids can&#39;t get vaccination and have a weak(ened) immune system. If they get infected with say mumps it&#39;s much more dangerous for them. </p>

<p>Answered already above. Not every kid can get vaccines, they rely on the healthy kids around them being immune/vaccinated. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>No, the trust into the efficiency of vaccines is quite high. The problem are the rising numbers of Anti-Vaxxers that don&#39;t vaccinate their children and endanger others. Also, once again these kids you&#39;re talking about can&#39;t get vaccinated, they rely on other kids being immune so that diseases can&#39;t spread. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Is any disease in question really all that life threatening, known to cause permanent damage, or even likely to be encountered in someone lifetime? Surely all those questions need to be thoroughly answered and weighed against the very real dangers of the vaccines themselves before anyone demands anything from anyone.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Polio. It has been on the rise over the last years despite being almost eradicated, mostly thanks to Anti-Vaxxers. Those questions have been thoroughly answered you&#39;re just ignoring them or calling people shills. Also the dangers of vaccines are far outweighed by their benefits and the dangers a polio or small pox outbreak would bring. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Most diseases also have other vectors of infection besides humans simply transmitting them to each other. They live and grow in various unsanitary and unhealthy environments and can be carried by air, water, insects, or animals or get into the human food chain with the same or an ever greater likelihood of spreading that way than humans themselves can spread them in some cases. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>But most viruses can&#39;t survive long outside of a human host. If they can&#39;t infect a human small pox viruses, for example, will slowly die off and the disease will die out. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>That particular threat doesn&#39;t change one iota so in essence the real problem of completely avoiding any encounter at all isn&#39;t actually resolved or even greatly diminished by insisting that absolutely every child be vaccinated.</p>

<p>Vaccines are a much safer option to gain immunity than infecting your child with real small pox, for example. </p>

<p>&quot;The US government department for Health Resources and Services Administration has recently released the running tally of the just-past-half-way-complete US Fiscal Year (FY) of 2017 for compensable vaccine injuries. It currently stands at over $142 million dollars. You read that right. That covers the 377 cases that were thus far successful in obtaining compensation in fiscal year 2017 through the heavily biased (to put it politely) system allegedly in place to redress damage done by vaccines in the USA

    <div class="md"><p>There is certainly corporate greed involved but I think it goes deeper.</p>

<p>When you let yourself be vaccinated, you are in effect giving full access to your bloodstream and you don&#39;t really know what&#39;s being injected into you.
Not only the vaccine agent itself often doesn&#39;t work but there are other things in there getting straight into your bloodstream: mercury/thimerosal, aluminium, preservatives, chemicals and who really knows what else. We just have to trust the pharmaceutical companies! No thanks...</p>

<p>Remember when vaccines in some parts of the world were found to contain a suspected sterilization agent (HCG), why was that in there?</p>

<p>And remember the cancer causing SV40 monkey simian virus that &#39;accidentally&#39; found its way in the polio virus in the fifties! (between 1955 and 1963 around 90% of children and 60% of adults in USA were inoculated with contaminated polio vaccines).</p>

<p>So they could well be adding things in the vaccines that make you sick in the long run, intentionally or not. And if in doubt, why chance it?</p>

<p>And then there is a whole new type of vaccines eventually coming that will work by modifying your DNA (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/10/health/protection-without-a-vaccine.html):">https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/10/health/protection-without-a-vaccine.html):</a>
&quot;The genes are placed into viruses and injected into human tissue, usually muscle. The viruses invade human cells with their DNA payloads, and the synthetic gene is incorporated into the recipient’s own DNA.&quot;
(some argue that existing vaccines already cause dna damage)
Think about that...
What if in the future there is no way to avoid getting injected with this sort of crap. They may at some point be able to easily detect who was injected or not.
Forced vaccination/medication is way too dangerous to let it happen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Vaccines don’t cure already sick kids. Do you understand how they work? And they do not harm healthy kids. You have no idea what you are talking about. Vaccines are dead versions of viruses that are injected into a host. They do not feel any ill effects, but the same virus sees itself there and can not infect the person. This is because bodies build up specific defenses against specific diseases, even if they are dead. And vaccines in no way harm children, all studies have pointed to them being beneficial. The one guy who started to ask questions lost his medical license because he lied to the public saying the caused autism, which is totally impossible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They&#39;re tightening laws because they don&#39;t want herd immunity to weaken, which will cause more deaths. Yes, for now, measles isn&#39;t killing tons of people, but it did back when vaccines were uncommon, or before they were invented. It makes perfect sense to make it mandatory to get a vaccine to prevent the breakdown of herd immunity, which allows people with compromised immune systems or allergies or whatever to be unvaccinated without getting sick. </p>

<p>I&#39;d also like to point out that measles isn&#39;t always the cause of death, but it can kill, especially the very young and very old. It can cause high fevers, which can be very deadly. It also can cause infertility. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks. As usual they have a clever response to explain away the results. Those of us who are skeptical read the article and become more skeptical. It raises more questions, more doubt.</p>

<p>“Normal” people read the article and believe the excuses as to how they were “false positives,” and call us crazy for being skeptical.</p>

<p>The most frustrating thing about these “normal” people is how extreme they are. I’ve had countless people in real life quite literally frothing at the mouth when I express my concerns about this issue out loud. Spittle flies everywhere as they blame me for a potential future outbreak of this or that.</p>

<p>And I say, “I’m vaccinated. My kids are all vaccinated. I’m simply asking why we’re adding laws for mandatory vaccination when there’a no statistical evidence of any reason to change things. The current system is working fine.”</p>

<p>And it’s like they short-circuit... (Because their extremely emotional opinions on this topic are formed by propaganda rather than logic.) After a pause they say, “Well there’s going to be an outbreak because of people like you and this growing movement of ‘antivaxers’!”</p>

<p>These people are insane. They actually believe WHO/UNICEF/etc. are just meddling over there because they just care so much about these people and want to help them. Out of the kindness of their hearts.</p>

<p>Because that’s what wealth, power, and corporate funded governments do. “Help people.”</p>

<p>But the irony is how extreme they get about the issue while thinking the side simply asking questions is extreme.</p>

<p>To be honest and direct - these people terrify me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re welcome! That is the mainstream article. There are others that say they were caught doing it because the only people they were vaccinating for it were women between the ages of 12 - 49.</p>

<p>Also, there is at least one scientific study that lasted 30 days that showed people who get vaccines are the contagious ones because they shed the virus(es) for 30 days. Could be much longer but the studies ended at 30 days. Plenty of evidence that natural exposure to the environment along with the mother&#39;s immunity protects from transmission of deadly infections... however, that is if the individual is not living in the system of manuafactured foods, unhealthy sleep cycles, Geoengineered air poisons, bombardment with wifi signals... etc. It&#39;s more profitable to the system for people to believe the propaganda... to each his own. That is the problem I have with mandatory, it takes away individual decision. The argument is back asswards IMO... if the people who die are those who don&#39;t get vaccinated, where is the problem... their decision. Why are these people who believe so much in vaccinations so interested in forcing life on others when in the whole abortion debate their belief is the exact opposite... that the mother should be able to end life. Makes no logical sense to me. I&#39;m vaccinated also, and so is my family, but I don&#39;t understand the frothing at the mouth of forcing it on anyone.</p>
