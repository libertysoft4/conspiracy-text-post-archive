<p>i suspect it&#39;s the opposite, where the majority of users are sequestered in various communities and echo chambers.</p>

<p>Moore, for example, is getting more attention because what he is being accused is worse and he has several accusers. </p>

The fact that people think it&#39;s just a bad joke in itself seems like a bad joke to me.
If Franken had done this to someone you cared about and she had these strong feelings you wouldn&#39;t sweep it under the rug.

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not sweeping it under the rug to acknowledge that there are <em>degrees</em> to this thing. Are you really saying that taking a humiliating photo of a bad joke wherein Franken pantomimes groping is equivalent to, say, Bill Cosby drugging women and fucking them, or Roy Moore seducing underage girls, or Louis CK exposing himself to his colleagues? They&#39;re all valid grievances, they&#39;re all inappropriate, but to expect them all to be treated exactly equally is to ignore nuance for the sake of artificially inflating the critique of Franken&#39;s behavior.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reddit is not a place for unbiased news. It never has been, and it never will be. So long as votes affect visibility (i.e. the core mechanic of Reddit), a feedback loop guarantees that only certain opinions make it to the front page.
