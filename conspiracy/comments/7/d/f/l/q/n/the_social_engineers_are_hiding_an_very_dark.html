        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This was the really incriminating and devious stuff they did not want coming out.</p>

<p><strong>Has anyone heard of any victims yet of the recent scandals being below 13?</strong></p>

<p>What about the global trafficking ring of pre-pubescent children? The spirit cooking revelations? The photos that emerged from Epsteins island of men in hoods? Tons of accounts of former elite sex slaves who claim they were tortured and electrocuted with cattle prods to be &quot;conditioned&quot;?</p>

<p>It&#39;s real legitimate child abuse and rape infused with satanic practices, that they are hiding from us, and instead dazzling us with &quot;breadcrumbs&quot; of Hollywood disposables. </p>

<p><strong>It&#39;s real and it&#39;s on both sides of the political spectrum</strong></p>

<p>Let&#39;s shift the focus back to what we really want uncovered. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right? The media spends so much time on Trump scandals that it has become the new baseline and any report that isn&#39;t critical of Trump now counts as being pro-Trump propaganda.</p>

<p>It&#39;s all designed to appeal to emotions and divide the narrative into left vs right. There is only one consistent message here:</p>

<p>**&quot;Any news that comes out in the next few days about political scandals should be interpreted as partisan bickering, and can be dismissed without further research&quot;</p>

It&#39;s suspicious because the handwriting in the two sections is different, especially the 7s, the fact that he signed it &quot;DA,&quot; despite not having been the DA at the time it was written, and the fact that it&#39;s a yearbook being signed in December, which is strange.

<p>Also the accuser said she never saw him since the 70’s yet Moore presided over her 1999 divorce? So she’s absolutely a liar just at the start before getting to the signature.</p>

<p>They also won’t let anyone examine the yearbook as well as wanting to go straight to a congressional inquiry NOT at all the court of law.</p>

<p>The news media also ignores everything they don&#39;t want the public to know. Covering pizzagate honestly would have been HUGE ratings. Even the people in denial would have watched that coverage the same way they&#39;d watch a train wreck, kind of like how Trump got billions in free advertising from &quot;liberal&quot; media outlets. But they didn&#39;t cover it. They covered it up. </p>

<p>We <em>are</em> focused. The mainstream isn&#39;t.</p>

<p>The only reason this have been able to continue for this long is that it&#39;s beyond belief. Try explaining something unbelievable and you will find that you&#39;re often not believed.</p>

<p>This is narrative forming, and the narrative now is vastly different than what is was a few months ago and will be in a few months from now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The MSM here in Norway covered the &quot;DarkRoom&quot; scandal extensively last year. It involved people -- including a police officer or two -- raping and torturing children (toddlers, infants, etc.). One of the cases even involved a woman getting pregnant just to be able to give birth to a child she (and/or her partner) planned to abuse sexually. </p>

<p>Then the MSM went silent. I guess the investigators went too deep. Perhaps they discovered that <em>powerful</em> people were involved in the abuse. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The mystery schools (Essenes, Mayan order, Masonic order, rosicrutians, etc) all teach the same thing; “thoughts are things” and they all teach that “all that exists in manifest form, first started as thought”</p>

<p>So when you take that tack and you look at our languages and our words, you can see this happening. Let’s take one of my favorite simple examples:</p>

<p>Information</p>

<p>Obviously nothing can be built without the correct information describing its nature.</p>

<p>Read that sentence three times.</p>

<p>In-formation to be formed</p>

<p>Describing de-scribe, to scribe, to create, write.</p>

<p>It’s nature - nature being that which eminates  into the being of the object, idea, thing, person</p>

<p>Etc</p>

<p>So if you look at language, it is what we use to define the universe, and language can be used on so many levels. Language is the most creative tool in the universe.</p>

<p>There is the language of man and the language of math, the language of man is needed to navigate thought, which life possesses - but the language of math is just innate to the universe. </p>

<p>So if you master the language of man, you can manipulate the thoughts of man to result in creations from the mind of man using the language of the universe, math.</p>

<p>People don’t think that the elites know what they are doing, but they do, you can only manipulate energies with the right understanding and tools.</p>

<p>People use the word &quot;cringe&quot; all the time, and you see NO issue with what she said?  I have no problem with people saying whatever they want, but for somebody that tries to be classy it&#39;s exceedingly in poor taste.  Like most hobos are classier.  And given other people she&#39;s been connected to, yes, she is very suspicious.  She also harps on how she&#39;s a girl from a &quot;working-class&quot; family, but that is not true as well.  </p>

<p>Also, given that she has relatives in the archaic British Empire system (why do they have Knights still???), we know with Jimmy Savile, Theresa May and the like that they will sweep ANYTHING under the rug to maintain the appearance of propriety.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Issue with her saying &#39;mega lolz&#39;? I mean not really.. AFAIK the phrase was nothing to do with pedophilia it&#39;s just something he created long before that. It was commonly used and popular, it could easily just be a part of her regular vocab now if she was in a relationship with him for some time. It makes no sense to me she intentionally put it in there as a homage to his pedophile behavior, is that the theory? Is everyone that uses &#39;mega lolz&#39; now a pedophile supporter? Obviously not. It&#39;s just more dumb internet slang who gives AF.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know about other people she&#39;s connected to tbf.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, and taking that argument is ridiculous, and you know it.  It wasn&#39;t a homage or that she supports pedophilia.  It DOES show, for that someone who is all about CHARITY and fundraising, that she doesn&#39;t give a shit about morality or ethics or thinking about the impact of what she says.  It&#39;s not funny or catchy, and saying all dumb internet slang is the same is patently untrue as well.</p>

<p>And if you think &quot;who gives AF&quot; why the fuck are you even commenting?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I would give AF if she was linked to something more suspicious but IMO a radio DJ using cringy outdated internet slang is not very significant. Do you not think she could have just forgot it had anything to do with him? Seems quite likely.</p>

I&#39;m saying if a friend said it I would not remember it being anything to do with Ian Watkins and it would go totally unnoticed (aside from me thinking they were weird for saying LOLZ) so it seems quite probable that she doesn&#39;t automatically tie it to Ian Watkins either.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is true but it was a phrase that existed before that. I dunno man maybe you&#39;re right it just seems weird. Like if a known pedophile uses a particular phrase no one is allowed to say that phrase again? The phrase becomes out of bounds just because someone bad used it? It just seems like people getting easily outraged.</p>

<p>That&#39;s what I&#39;m saying, what is the importance? I guess we just have different opinions on what is PC/acceptable or not which is fair enough. I guess we&#39;ll leave it there.</p>

<p>The importance is that our media is controlled by people of low ethical value, and they make light of things that are extremely dark and insidious.  Ian Watkins is NOT an isolated incident...there are people far worse than him.   And they are mostly connected to the elites, which she is a part of.  She&#39;s also friends with people in the Ordo Templi Orientis (OTO)...it&#39;s all about shining a light on the people that hide in the shadows.  And some of those people also hide the light, too...</p>

<p>One of the men who was awaiting the birth of his child with his girlfriend discussed plans to sexually abuse the baby once it was born, police said.</p>

<p>Some of those detained had live-streamed abuse of their own children. Those arrested include two elected officials, one teacher and a lawyer.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Former U.S. House speaker Dennis Hastert has been released from a federal prison 13 months after he began serving a sentence for a bank fraud conviction linked to his effort to buy the silence of a former student he sexually abused during his days as a high school wrestling coach.</p>

<p>Hastert, 75, pleaded guilty to illegal structuring of bank withdrawals as part of an effort to circumvent federal banking laws as he went about paying off someone identified in court as &quot;Individual A&quot; for abuse that occurred more than 30 years ago during his years as a teacher and coach in Yorkville, Ill.</p>

<p>The former speaker served about 13 months of a 15-month sentence, according to federal prison records, and now faces two years of supervised release and lawsuits from former students who say they were victims of Hastert.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How about that? This guy has abusing kids for <em>years</em> and still managed to become speaker of the house. No time for the abuse, just for the <em>paying off of the victim</em>. </p>

<p>This isn&#39;t something that develops overnight either. There&#39;s never &quot;just one time&quot; with people who are sexual abusers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>okay, here&#39;s the point. We have an example of Hastert Sexually abusing kids, paying people off, conspiring. Things people who care about politicians abusing kids and keeping it quiet should be all about, right?

Most of these posts have less then 10 comments and only one breaks 100. </p>

<p>this guy should be the poster child for pizzagate or however you wanna brand it, but pizzagaters don&#39;t really seem all that interested in talking about him. (which is why I forgot about him until you brought him up) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Definitely agree there. Regardless of the legitimacy of the whole pizzagate story, there&#39;s definitely some horrific level child abuse/sex slavery shit going on in elite circles. </p>

<p>Remember reading a post on Reddit a while ago about a member if another forum (suspected to be Robert Downey Junior) basically confirming that he was aware of such stuff and I think Hayden Panettierre (Save the cheerleader, save the world) the as among the victims.</p>

<p>There&#39;s been some recent revelations of sexual harassment being rife here in UK parliament and historical stories of gay orgies with under age rent boys and such like among UK MPs.</p>

<p>And just to throw a further aspect into the works, the us if sexual abuse is, according to what I&#39;ve read/listened to, a classic part of MKUltra mind control techniques (ie. Horrific trauma used to break the psyche of targets who can then be proframmed</p>

<p>Their plan works like this:</p>

<p>The satanic ritual shit isn’t because they believe in it, it is to sound ridiculous and to convince the people in their groups to transgress.</p>

<p>The current spate of sexual assault allegations started real, but then not only are they throwing a ton under the bus but also making sure to implicate politicians with overtones of being hit jobs.  This is all to muddy the waters and make people bored or suspicious of future allegations.</p>

<p>If <em>everyone</em> gets accused, it will seem like just more political name calling and impact will be lessened.  Democrats will call real proof fake news and so will GOP.  It will turn into a political issue.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow. You dont need to belittle that problem in order to call attention to a more insidious branch of the same issue. &quot;Groping&quot; -dismissive air quotes and all - is adult men lording their social power over other human beings in order to control, embarass, objectify &amp; abuse them. You don&#39;t need to downplay the seriousness of one thing to argue another thing is worse. We can be outraged about both things at the same time. The same people who grope &amp; otherwise sexually harass women have the same mindset and are probably the same people who are doing the darker things you&#39;re imaging.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think anyone&#39;s saying this. Most are very willing to accept and understand that powerful politicians participate use their power for purposes of sexual assault or sexual harassment. We even have documented instances of child molestation.</p>

<p>What people <em>are</em> saying is that &quot;will I do better playing dominoes on cheese instead of pasta?&quot; isn&#39;t necessarily code for systemic child-fucking, nor is it proof of literally anything.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. I think they know that pedophiles are close to being exposed and they&#39;re pushing these &quot;fall guys&quot; out in front. Groping someone is nothing compared to what they&#39;ve done. Asking if you can masturbate in front of someone is nothing compared to what they&#39;ve done. </p>

<p>Charlie Sheen was accused of doing drugs with an underage Corey Haim and raping him. Why didn&#39;t that accusation get the kind of attention that it deserves? Why is everyone obsessing over some asshole Republican? Did anyone hear of this Moore guy before these allegations? Like yeah, I&#39;m sure he&#39;s a sick fuck too, but why is the media obsessing over that while ignoring other instances that the public should be concerned with? It&#39;s because this thing we&#39;re seeing isn&#39;t organic. Some of the gross people being exposed are DEFINITELY being exposed on purpose in a controlled way. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I noticed that as well. Also see the paragraph in Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide about a normal guy trying to get his head around something huge (the destruction of the Earth to be specific): </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Earth.
Visions of it swam sickeningly through his nauseated mind. There was no way his imagination could feel the impact of the whole Earth having gone, it was too big. He prodded his feelings by thinking that his parents and his sister had gone. No reaction. He thought of all the people he had been close to. No reaction. Then he thought of a complete stranger he had been standing behind in the queue at the supermarket before and felt a sudden stab – the supermarket was gone, everything in it was gone. Nelson’s Column
had gone! Nelson’s Column had gone and there would be no outcry, because there was no one left to make an outcry. From now on Nelson’s Column only existed in his mind. England only existed in his mind – his mind, stuck here in this dank smelly steel-lined spaceship. A wave of claustrophobia closed in on him.</p>

<p>England no longer existed. He’d got that – somehow he’d got it. He tried again. America, he thought, has gone. He couldn’t grasp it. He decided to start smaller again. New York has gone. No reaction. He’d never seriously believed it existed anyway. The dollar, he thought, had sunk for ever. Slight tremor there. Every Bogart movie has been wiped, he said to himself, and that gave him a nasty knock. McDonalds, he thought. There is no longer
any such thing as a McDonald’s hamburger.</p>

<p>He passed out. When he came round a second later he found he was sobbing for his mother.</p>

<p>Some of those detained had live-streamed abuse of their own children. Those arrested include two elected officials, one teacher and a lawyer.</p>
