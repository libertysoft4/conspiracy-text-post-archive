<p>It has the amazing property of making people under it&#39;s influence do anything they are told, leaving them with no memory of what they did.  The YouTube link is a vice documentary about it, 35 minutes and should be seen by anyone who wonders how patsies are are made. </p>

<p>Edit: every time I see photos or footage of James Holmes, the &quot;Batman killer&quot;, I think of this drug.  Most of the time he was in court, you could see confusion on his face.  He&#39;d concentrate deeply, as if trying desperately to remember something he couldn&#39;t, or figure out an impossible puzzle.</p>

<p>Edit #2: I find it interesting that the top comment is a new addition within the last 40 minutes which claims this is all bullshit.  Even more interesting is that I can&#39;t, for some reason, reply to that comment.  I get the little notification that &quot;Something went wrong&quot; every time I try.</p>

<p>Edit #3: top comment, which was several paragraphs long with links and much &quot;debunking&quot; was deleted just a few minutes after I made note of it in edit#2.  If anyone has any ideas about why that comment is the only one I couldn&#39;t reply to, I&#39;d like to hear them.</p>

<p>Edit#4 that top comment was removed by mods, but why?  I certainly didn&#39;t agree with it, but <strong>it broke no rules of the sub. Why did moderators remove it?</strong></p>

<p>Edit 5 the oddly behaving comment has been restored. I was able to reply this time. I asked the poster why mods removed the comment. No reply as of yet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Personally I&#39;ve found that promethazine gives a better sleep than diphenhydramine, albeit at higher than normal doses[0]. Combined with 20mg tamazepam when necessary (I have severe headaches which keep me awake, which are worsened by insomnia, so sometimes fairly drastic measures are needed to break that cycle). It has a stronger anticholinergic effect though, so the risk of side-effects / long-term effects at those dosages is a definite consideration.</p>

<p>Oddly I didn&#39;t find diphenhydramine to be nearly as reliable[1] - before switching to my current antihistamines, I was taking 100mg, which made me <em>drowsy</em> but didn&#39;t do much to actually get me to sleep.</p>

<p>[0] 100mg, per my doctor&#39;s instructions (NB use as a sedative is usually in the 25-50mg range, so I <em>strongly</em> advise against anyone trying that dose without medical advice)</p>

<p>[1] For sleep anyway - it was primarily used for its antihistamine properties.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I second this. Its been blown out of proportion for sure. On top of that, even if it was actually possible to do, everyone reacts slightly different to drugs. Forget about proper dosage per bodyweight, or full stomach, or anything else. Its just not possible. I would find it more believable that there is some form of hypnotism than this. Its just another media trying to scare parents ploy, and boost ratings by calling it a zombie drug or something.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, in the hospital in the United States. Was 1976 and I was pretty young, 18, so you kinda do what they tell you to do. I don&#39;t even remember them asking me if I wanted it, they just gave it to me. </p>

<p>I went in because I was in labor. Turns out my son was breech, so I&#39;m assuming they gave it to me because of that hoping it would erase any bad memories. He&#39;s fine, the birth went ok . .. I think. They knocked me out just before he was born in case it didn&#39;t go well, I&#39;m guessing. But, that stuff is pretty awful. It&#39;s like you&#39;re looking at what is going on from the outside rather than experiencing it yourself. I only have vague memories of the whole thing and it took a while to wear off. I don&#39;t remember much of the next 24 hrs after he was born either. I was in labor for 8-9 hours and I remember only 3 things. They wouldn&#39;t let me go to the bathroom to pee afraid I&#39;d lose him in the toilet, I guess. They told me to lay on my left side so he&#39;d get better blood flow. And, I remember waiting for the Dr to come in to deliver him, while his butt was crowning, and the nurses were talking about what they would have for lunch. That&#39;s it. The entire total of my memories of those 8-9 hours. </p>

<p>Are the effects of the drug stated here false?

<p>No, it won&#39;t. Not from any reputable source that I saw.</p>

<p>I watched the whole Vice movie (not documentary). Did you?</p>

<p>Did you notice that nobody &quot;official&quot;, like the doctor or the cop, said anything about turning people in to agreeable zombies or pre-programmed killers?</p>

<p>They talked about this drug the same way they&#39;d talk about any other rape drug. Only the whores and dealers, who were paid by Vice, were making up the kind of stories the OP is talking about.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t fully agree with him.  In the case of Navy Yard Shooter and Aurora, CO shooters, I do believe they were mind controlled, and not patsies, but with the use of some relatively modern tech.  If scopalamine is involved, I don&#39;t believe it&#39;s the key ingredient.</p>

<p>Oswald and the Saudi hijackers, though, I agree are obvious patsies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Holmes was &quot;not displaying any outward emotion or any outward sign of engagement of what&#39;s going on&quot; when the police questioned him as he stood in plain sight outside the movie theater. 
Now why the fuck haven&#39;t they taken him to the station and drug tested him? Or perhaps they did, and the results vanished? Who knows. 
Whats clear is that he wasn&#39;t mentally ill, he wasn&#39;t a &quot;loner&quot; or a psychopath. seems like he developed schizophrenia out of nowhere, without any triggers. </p>

<p>My opinion is that he went too far with  his research. He either fucked up himself or someone assisted him. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I watch the vice documentary a while back and it was pretty cool. Do you think the effects would last long enough from just standard scopolamine, or would it have to be some modified research chem developed from scop with a longer half life? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ecuadorian here.</p>

<p>Scopolamine is a huge problem in South America, criminals use it on unsuspecting victims, they bring them to the ATMs and make them withdraw all the money they can from their bank accounts and the victims have no recolections of the events. They also go to businesses, use Scopolamine on the business clerk and tell them to give them all the money. A high dose of it can kill the vicim, like it has in the past.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah...hur dur...just because Vice sucks and has been bought out by libtards means everything about the drug is false and is all sensational garbage.</p>

<p>This is a prime example of gaslighting.....
&quot;You got your information from Vice! ...they suck balls and everything they say is bullshit...and if you believe OP you&#39;re a moron.&quot;</p>

<p>...what was false or bullshit?</p>

<p>Are the effects of the drug stated here false?
I&#39;m really confused why you&#39;re so sceptical that it isn&#39;t possible it could be a possibility.</p>

<p>Just a simple Google search will give you the same side effects as listed in the story.</p>
