    <div class="md"><p>Hmmm...no points for you.  You didn’t suggest a solution, just a dry attempt at wit.  I’m serious, if the shills are running amok, the best way to differentiate is to check the slant of the poster.  If there is no suggestion, consider it to be someone who is only interested in attention, and not someone who actively engages subjects from the point of betterment.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the comment.  The point is to address the problems and come up with solutions.  There is no intent towards censorship, just intellectual banter.  To be frank, there are solutions...and this is one thread of many to humanize a situation that seems impossible to solve.  It is true, that your comment isn’t suggesting anything, just restating the obvious.  Perhaps, it’s better to “reason” through it all.  I think perhaps knowing how to reason, is a lost art in striking up conversations.  Through reasoning, we can and will find solutions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How about this for a solution, if the existence of shills truly bothers you, abandon Reddit, Twitter, Facebook, Etc. Seek out other smaller message boards/social media that aren&#39;t worth shilling or manipulating. No, not Voat, Voat fucked up by being too similar to Reddit, it&#39;s already loaded with shills. There are plenty of other communities out there that exist and thrive outside of popular social media. </p>

<p>Wherever you can find millions of peoples eyes, you&#39;re also going to find manipulation, not just by TPTB, but by anyone with a bit of cash, <a href="https://youtu.be/FxNvUWN3vYk">$200 in this case. </a>. </p>
