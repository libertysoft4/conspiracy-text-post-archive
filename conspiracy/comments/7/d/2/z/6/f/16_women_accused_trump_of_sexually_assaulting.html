    <div class="md"><p>If Spacey was a high level political figure and campaigning to stamp out corruption then most people would question the timing and validity of the accusations. Also, on an intuitive and entirely biased level, I don’t think many people find the spacey accusations that surprising, meaning people skipped the ‘where’s the evidence’ stage and went straight to the ‘wow it’s finally caught up with him’ stage.</p>

<p>With trump, most people are at the ‘where’s the evidence’ stage, and judging by the investigation into the Russia/Trump thing, people are starting to assume there probably is no evidence </p>

    <div class="md"><p>From the article you posted: </p>

<p>&#39;&quot;During a deposition given by me in connection with my matrimonial case, I stated that my husband had raped me,” Ivana Trump said in a statement at the time, as the Daily Beast reported. &quot;[O]n one occasion during 1989, Mr. Trump and I had marital relations in which he behaved very differently toward me than he had during our marriage. As a woman, I felt violated, as the love and tenderness, which he normally exhibited towards me, was absent. I referred to this as a &#39;rape,&#39; but I do not want my words to be interpreted in a literal or criminal sense.&quot;&#39;</p>

<p>The claims were true, that his ex-wife ha said he raped him. She now says that when she said &quot;rape&quot; she just meant inappropriate touching/behaviour. So it is not a lie, as you claimed, to say &quot;his first wife says he raped her&quot;. </p>

<p>&quot;Spend some time researching your claims so you won&#39;t have to be embarrassed when they&#39;re proven to be fake news.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, the story of the rape she claims is &quot;totally without merit&quot;. But the fact remains that she DID say that he raped her, as explained in the quotes I took in the previous comment. This is what I was claiming. This is what you said was fake news.</p>

<p>Sorry if this seems pedantic, but you were trying to make out as though any story of Trump raping his first wife were completely made up out of the blue in an effort to make Trump look bad, when there is a reason this came into the limelight (namely, she did say during their divorce that he raped her).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jesus Christ. Seriously, how have you not understood by now what I am trying to say. Lets go through it slowly.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>She said, during their divorce, that he raped her.</p></li>
<li><p>She now says that she merely meant &quot;As a woman, I felt violated, as the love and tenderness, which he normally exhibited towards me, was absent. I referred to this as a &#39;rape,&#39; but I do not want my words to be interpreted in a literal or criminal sense.&quot;</p></li>
</ul>

<p>To conclude, the reporting that there was originally an allegation of rape is correct, but the woman in question now says that it was not the case, but that she (just) felt violated by him.</p>

<p>What is wrong with what I am saying?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump is the POTUS. If talking about sexual assault allegations of the POTUS is not up <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>&#39;s alley, then I don&#39;t know what this place is for.</p>

<p>Also, I see so much made up shit in this sub all the time, so saying that the reason these Trump allegations aren&#39;t talked about as much is because they are made up, I would say is an incorrect assumption. There is another reason, and my assumption is that the vocal majority here love Trump and view him with blinkered vision.</p>

<p>&quot;But, I guess that&#39;s not readily obvious to people for whatever reason.&quot;</p>
