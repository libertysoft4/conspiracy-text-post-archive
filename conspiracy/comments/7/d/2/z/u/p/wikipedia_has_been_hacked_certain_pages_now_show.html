    <div class="md"><p>Eh I think if Q anon is AI we should resist it. We shouldn&#39;t allow AI to take over, no way!</p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen wacky stuff too. All I feel confident about at the moment is that the world is changing rapidly. How I feel about it deep down I must say is optimistic and excited. I no longer have a feeling of dread and trepidation that I was waking up with every morning for a long time. I don&#39;t really know exactly why I feel that way, but I feel something good in my bones.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s what i figure. If AI is here and it&#39;s actually going after corruption... then it must be following some sort of &quot;good&quot; and potentially it&#39;s tied to our collective desires. Perhaps it&#39;s doing what&#39;s best for humans. Maybe. Maybe it&#39;s directed by us, through memes, prayer, good shit. Maybe we need to walk in a very good path so that the mechanism is used for good. Idk. Maybe jesus was right.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey, whether you want to accept Jesus as your savior or not--and that&#39;s entirely up to YOU, He&#39;s only offering--I don&#39;t think anybody can deny Jesus was right about a lot of stuff: Treat others as you want to be treated, love your neighbor, moneychangers suck, take good care of the kids, God loves us, etc., etc. </p>

<p>Personal endorsement: Jesus saved my soul, pulled me out of a horrible downward spiral, may even have led me to this place to learn more and share what I&#39;ve learned. But that&#39;s just MY experience. I can only say that He worked for me, and I am eternally grateful. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Demiurge argument for the Old Testament doesn&#39;t really hold up when reading the New Testament. Yahshua says that he is a part of Yahweh. A great example of this is 
John 5:46  &quot;For had ye believed Moses, ye would have believed me: for he wrote of me.&quot;
The Old Testament was the history of the Hebrew people, and their God. The New Testament is the direct teaching of God. The Old Testament was written by a series of prophets, and while these were chosen humans; they were just humans. All of the prophets were flawed individuals in some way: Noah with the drinking, David when he killed a man, Solomon with his lust for women and wealth, and Moses even killed a man and then took credit for one of God&#39;s miracles. This is where you get the recording of archaic laws in Deuteronomy; which were Hebrew laws. The prophets spoke to God, but not all the time. The New Testament was written by human prophets with access to the direct source of God&#39;s will. This means that what Jesus said outweighs anything else that is said in the Bible. The Old Testament is important because it fortold of the coming of the Messiah with specific criteria that only Jesus matched, and it also served as a way to carry the Hebrew history of our world. Jesus directly quotes the Old Testament an incredible amount of times in the New Testament, and here&#39;s an article on that: <a href="https://jewsforjesus.org/answers/jesus-references-to-old-testament-scriptures/">Jesus references to old testament scriptures</a>. Here is a great video that explains this whole thing a lot better than me: <a href="https://youtu.be/m3Wyxeg1mYE">The Secret Name of Jesus</a> Please give the video a chance. The Holy Bible is the story that tells of the coming of our savior Yahshua HaMashiach and his sacrifice for our redemption. God bless, and may peace, love, and safety be with you and yours! <a href="https://youtu.be/8ferLIsvlmI">Covenants</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/3BGO9Mmd_cU">The Law</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/G_OlRWGLdnw">Atonement</a>.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure about the hell part, though maybe people who literally sell their souls are doomed to that fiery pit. </p>

<p>I tend to lean more and more towards reincarnation, which even Jesus seems to allude to a couple times in the Bible. </p>

<p><a href="http://reluctant-messenger.com/origen3.html">http://reluctant-messenger.com/origen3.html</a></p>

<p>If you&#39;re good, you move up the scale. If you&#39;re not, you move down. It&#39;s a long journey and some of it is going to suck.</p>

<p>That doesn&#39;t suit the controlling power paradigm, however, so maybe some of Jesus&#39;s other comments about this got spiked.</p>

<p>Honestly, I don&#39;t really think much about heaven and hell. It&#39;s not my place to judge, especially about the masses. Bushes, Clintons, Cheneys, at least half of Hollywood....we&#39;ll see how things ultimately end up for them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My kid said some amazing things as a very young child, including the stories shared with him by African hunter who was his &quot;imaginary friend&quot; in our early 1900s refurbished house. He named this guy very specifically. We found it adorable.</p>

<p>Turned out when I was doing research at the city library for a separate project, I took the time to look up the ownership history of our house back in the day. Turned out the first owner had the same last name as my son&#39;s &quot;imaginary friend.&quot;</p>

<p>I still get chills just typing that. But it&#39;s true, and one of the many small stones that built the house of the consciousness I now possess of our strange, strange world. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow that&#39;s awesome.</p>

<p>When I was a kid, I used to see the owner who built the house we live in and talk to him regularly. His name was Frank, heavyset and bearded. My mom used freak when I mentioned him and changed the subject. When I got older, she admitted when my parents bought the house, they were warned that the old owner passed in the house and still haunts it. They didn&#39;t believe in ghosts and laughed it off, until I started seeing and talking to him. He used to open the doors, turn on light switches etc.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a lesson also in attachments. He loved that house more than anything and is under the illusion that he should stay there instead of moving on and further evolving. Many religions warn of attachments.</p>

<p>Crazy existence indeed</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jesus would disagree. Matthew 7:13-14 &quot;Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat:</p>

<p>Because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it.&quot; </p>

<p>The basic idea of the Bible is that we were originally made in God&#39;s image. We were cut off from Life/Creator through our choices which corrupted our form. After we ate the forbidden fruit God said we would die. Since he loves his creations; he&#39;s offered us a choice. We can choose to go our own way; which separated us in the first place, and will lead to destruction of soul. We can also choose to repent of our sinful nature, and turn back to our creator. It really comes down to if we believe we are as a &quot;god&quot; like Lucifer promised, or if we are humble and faithful enough to realize that we are a flawed creation who need redemption. Here are a few videos that you may find interesting/entertaining: <a href="https://youtu.be/YbipxLDtY8c">Image of God</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/Zy2AQlK6C5k">Heaven &amp; Earth</a>, and <a href="https://youtu.be/3dEh25pduQ8">Messiah</a>. If you just watch one please watch the Image of God. This is some of what I&#39;ve gathered. Yahshua bless, and may peace, love, and safety be with you and yours! </p>
