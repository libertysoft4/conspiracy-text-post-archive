        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Did anybody notice something weird in the first episode of The Punisher?</p>

<p>When the white conservative was making his rant about the “do-good liberal” at the Veteans help group meeting, the black guy immediately says “Fuck you <strong>cracker</strong>”</p>

<p>I didn’t and still don’t understand this part for this racial slur to be put in the dialogue at all. The white guy didnt call him a ‘porch monkey’ he didn’t call him a ‘nigger’ or a ‘coon’ he wasn’t even talking directly to him, he was talking to the entire group. He was only talking about how liberals were taking his second amendment rights and his freedom of speech but the black veteran just calls him a cracker for no reason and nobody gave a shit. Because let’s be honest, if the white guy said anything insensitive to the black guy, we would have had to sit there and listen to a lecture about racism.</p>

<p>We saw this again when Franks son referred Muslims to ‘jihadees’ and Frank grabs him by his mouth and says to never say that word again. I agree with this part because children should never use racial slurs and should be nipped in the butt, but at the Vetran meeting, when the black veteran calls him a cracker (for no fucking reason), nobody said anything, the organizer didn’t even say anything along the lines of “Hey man, we don’t use racial slurs here, be respectful” but he didn’t. </p>

<p>Wtf?</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> For everyone who is down voting, how about giving me a good fucking reason why this dialogue was put in.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Correct again. Boiling frogs. First they destroyed the unions, who would have provided organized resistance to oligarchy. Next, they decimated the standard of living of the middle class with disastrous trade agreements illegal immigration, and real estate/equity market ponzi scams. They have permanently introduced 10% real unemployment and use it to stifle dissent. Any interaction with the police can be escalated the point that you can be destroyed financially. Employers are claiming the right to regulate out of work speech. The 2nd Amendment has been infringed upon to the point that it barely exists in some states. It is all about the permanent introduction of oligarchy. </p>

<p>That’s my point. Do you really think that if the white guy had said anything racially charged towards the black guy, nothing would have happened? No #boycott The Punisher for being racist and having “white supremacy ideals” Or like I said in my original statement, if the white guy said anything racially charged we would have had to be lectured about racism. But, flip the race and nobody cares. I’m sick and tired of this double standard bullshit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>When I was in 7th grade, I was arguing with this black guy in class and he called me an &quot;F*****G White Boy.&quot;  I said &quot;If you can call me that, I can call you a Nigger right?&quot; I realized I shouldn&#39;t have said this, and from his reaction, I started to get really nervous.</p>

<p>When the bell rung, it took me longer to leave the classroom than everybody else becasue my backpack was broken (and I was nervous to leave).  When I finally left class, him and his other black friends were waiting for me in the hallway and jumped me.  Luckily the teacher came out before I got seriously injured.  </p>

<p>It seems like everything in the media is one-sided as far as racism goes.  It&#39;s always whites being racist towards another race.  I attended a 30%/50% black/hispanic populated middle school, then moved to a 90% hispanic high school, and I can say there are just as many &quot;racists&quot; in other races, not just whites.  </p>

<p>It can&#39;t be a one-way street.  All races should be treated with respect.  I could personally care less if you call me any word, it doesn&#39;t bother me.  But, speaking on what OP said, you can&#39;t cry about the N word or words towards other races, and then have no reaction to words against white people, because let&#39;s face it, that&#39;s really the only race that people have no reaction to when called a racial word.  </p>

It isn&#39;t the severity of the word that he called me, it&#39;s that he called me it in the first place, and people think it&#39;s okay.  He would have had a problem if I called him a black boy.  And if he would have called me cracker, people would have said I shouldn&#39;t have called him the N word, not even mentioning what he called me.  There is a double standard.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, yes there is you poor oppressed white man. Look, dude, we&#39;ve got 400 years of collective racial oppression to deal with, so maybe if a black man calls a white man cracker (or white boy) it doesn&#39;t carry nearly the same weight as the reverse. And, seriously, do you think cracker is even close to the n word?</p>

<p>Probly 80% have white male as the uncool / idiot / slob figure amidst a group of other demographics. </p>

The dishonest slob BF who speaks “French” to the nice white girl while A-A male neighbor watches ? </p>

<p>Probly just insurance companies (and banks) have been identified charging higher premiums (or withholding loans) to lower income zip codes. In order to win back minority customers or just camouflage their actions, Insurance runs a steady stream of ads which mock white males. The targeted viewers have a “favorable reaction” to the ads though they don’t necessarily know why.</p>
