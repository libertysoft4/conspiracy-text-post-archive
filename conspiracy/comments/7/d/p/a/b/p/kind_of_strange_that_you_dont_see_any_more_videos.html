    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t think of where I can find the link at the moment.  I have read and re-posted an article that stated the youths name, and how old he was, 14 years old, and that he was a Palestinian who was born in Syria.  He was captured while he was some kind of youth helper to the Syrian Arab Army.  The speculation was that like many he lied and said he was older to be in the army as a helper.  I&#39;m on the kid&#39;s side and don&#39;t think Prisoners Of War should be executed the way Islamist routinely do.  The kid had every right to join the legal government&#39;s fight against Islamic &#39;rebels.&#39;  He died fighting the bad guys.  Requiescat in pace et in amore.  </p>

<p>So, they say they captured this kid from a refugee camp.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know if you are a holocaust denier or if you are a historian with actual knowledge or just another Internet troll.  Regardless, the point stands.  Hitler did advocate removing Jewry from German society, for reasons quite similar to Marx&#39;s identification of Judaism as synonymous with the bourgeoisie.  Whether Hitler himself ordered any gassing of Jews or if they just starved to death in Ford Motor Company&#39;s labor camps, I don&#39;t know.</p>

<p>No, it really doesn&#39;t.  If it&#39;s not real, then it doesn&#39;t stand.  It is understood that Hitler sought removal of Jewry from Germany.  That is not the same thing as &quot;having logical reasons for gassing jews.&quot;</p>

Diluting the horrific reality with the phrase &quot;remove Jewry&quot; is a great way to begin to justify what was done.  Congratulations, you are proving my point.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The apparent &#39;cuts&#39; to Islamic State fighters and Al Qaeda and their White Helmets did not include cuts to their transportation budget.  The US led forces in Raqqa just let a large number of Islamic State fighters leave in a four mile convoy of vehicles loaded with weapons.  The US wants to us the Islamic Jihadist pawns in a new area against the secular Syrian government that has defeated the US backed Islamists.   So the implication that President Trump stopped the Pentagon&#39;s use of Islamic commandos like Al Qaeda and the Islamic State is at best wishful thinking.

<p>I know her personally.
Truly independent with no agenda, no one to report to,  o o e who can fire her.
Most of what she does is unpaid. She is almost penniless and depends solely on donations and her self belief in what she is doing.</p>

<p>She has immersed herself in the awful truth in both Gaza and Syria for the last decade.</p>

<p>I am amazed that she is still so optimistic that eventually the rest of us will start hearing what she has to say.</p>

<p>Her blog is called ingaza on WordPress if you want to read more a d you can support her on Patreon</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Eva Bartlet was the one who got me into following Syria. I remember back when I barely followed global politics at all, I&#39;d get my news on Syria from BBC and AJ+ who highlighted ISIS all the time. But ISIS emerged in 2014 when it took Mosul; there&#39;ve been documented crimes before that by the &#39;moderate rebels&#39; who Eva helped expose. Awesome journalist, actually bothers getting on ground and obtaining information unlike the SOHR (one man with Nusra connections) or the WH.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I always like to keep positivity in my comments on Syria; they&#39;ve won. Syria, with its allies, hasn&#39;t just won but they&#39;ve turned quite a few PNAC-esque long term strategies to dirt by winning <em>and</em> re-formed a powerful &#39;axis of resistance&#39; plus a new member, Iraq!</p>

<p>The IRGC, Hezbollah, SAA, Iraqi army, PMUs, all battle hardened now. The Kurdistan debacle was hilarious, so much so that only Israel was left whining about it since that&#39;s where a lot of its oil came from. Now KSA&#39;s bubbling up and trying to create a war in Lebanon.</p>

<p>But like I said, good work Syrians. </p>
