When the murky web of poison is lifted from society and wealth is injected into it, the world will experience a mental evolutionary jump. That will lead to a high point and open the gates to the new Golden Age. Many, many good times are ahead. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Either p implies np or it doesn&#39;t. If it does then most of the existing encryption is a fail and we can confidently expect the complete collapse of society via hacking. If it doesn&#39;t then the next generation of technology is golden and the establishment will have to embrace it in order to save itself.</p></li>
<li><p>Networks are under the control of the people who have physical access to their nodes (~devices) and edges (~fibers, wires, frequencies). The current Internet is almost entirely under the control of the establishment because the central nodes reside in their server farms and they enjoy privileged access to its edges.</p></li>
<li><p>A network controls the things that it is able to identify. The point of identifying nodes is to allow them to be controlled, the point of identifying edges is to allow them to be controlled, the point of identifying people is is to allow them to be controlled. </p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>We can remove the brainwashing that drives people to selfishness and educate the masses on how Planetary selfishness leads to more wealth than personal selfishness. For example, a selfish planet would never tolerate homelessness, starvation, war, tryranny, out of control income inequality, an overly complicated economy, ect..  </p>

<p>Believe it or not, service orientated people get much more in life than selfish orientated people. Giving is getting. People can have everything they want by giving what they want for themselves. What goes around comes around like a boomerang. I can carefully help a little kid understand an adult term knowing with full certainty that someone will give me that same kind of attention measure for measure on something I don’t understand in the future. </p>

<p>The fastest way to hell is to create a planet where everyone only worries about themselves. Being entirely selfless is bad too because sacrifice is bad. Self sacrifice is bad because the self is a person too. Therefore, a balance between self and other service has to be made with service orientation being the main stance. </p>

<p>One day I will break this whole thing down in a way that will convince people without a shadow of a doubt that outwardly love to all people like a Planetary Family is absolutely the fastest way to a wealthy, happy life. We are def headed in this direction. It may not seem like it now but a lot will happen after the cabal takedown that will eventually lead to this realization. </p>

<p>Well last week the mass media was pushing Biden 2020, so pretty relevant. But thanks to people with &quot;confirmation bias&quot; regarding his touching of little girls the Biden 2020 media movement fell flat on its face. So, pretty relevant</p>

<p>Im not sure the &quot;Creepy Biden&quot; thing is as much of a niche conspiracy meme as it is a generally known thing. Wish i still had the links but when some democratic figure heads were reposting Biden 2020 articles last week they were lambasted by &quot;Creepy Biden&quot; replies. For every 1 reply of support there were 20 people posting clips of him being weird.</p>

<p>I think its completely unrealistic that hed be able to run with that mass-circulated video evidence of him being weird. </p>

<p>Plus you had an ex-secret service come out and say he had to protect women from him on some &quot;weinstein-level stuff&quot;: <a href="http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2017/11/exclusive-former-joe-biden-secret-service-agent-protect-women-weinstein-level-stuff/">http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2017/11/exclusive-former-joe-biden-secret-service-agent-protect-women-weinstein-level-stuff/</a>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand your sentiment but I&#39;d be cautious at framing it as a liberal vs conservative thing. Trust there are good peoples on both sides that want the same thing in regards of a representative and transparent government that acts according to the people&#39;s needs and views.</p>

<p>In the case of these guys, I think they&#39;re intention is more focused on a dismissal of dangerous revelations as opposed to a left right battle.</p>

<p>Trust me my right-wing brother, once we can get rid of the divisive/ binary mode of political thinking we&#39;re going to find out that both sides of regular people have more in common than in opposition</p>

<p>Fair. It could easily be shills posing as leftists to create a divide in the community. Still the idea of a leftist conspiracy theorist is hilarious to me. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you missed the point of this guy&#39;s post.  He&#39;s saying that it doesn&#39;t matter if he&#39;s fake or not.   That the world (well mostly America) in general are starting to question things that were previously unasked.  Not Q&#39;s questions.<br/>
Even people who have never heard of the poster supposedly are &quot;waking up&quot;.  I haven&#39;t seen it myself, but I think these reports are what he&#39;s talking about.  (in the variety of &quot;my grandma is even saying, maybe it was the intelligence agencies&quot; who were previously US/party line all the way.<br/>
People seem to be ready to understand something more, at the very least, what he&#39;s talking about, is that people are now looking for answers instead of waiting for them to come to them (the thirst).<br/>
I&#39;m not convinced the poster is legit.  I think at best, it&#39;s someone with a great imagination, slightly better intel/information than the average joe, who is able to connect the dots to make somewhat general educated guesses.  And he&#39;s a great writer.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean, that just seems like what every generation goes through. I think we said the same thing when we got TV, internet, smartphones, apps and on and on. Right now I think people are witnessing a HUGE journalistic endeavor into the presidents suspicious activities and realising from it that one of the major parties is entirely incappable. In this one administration generations are being exposed to ridiculous nepotism, blind allegiance, hardcore baseless partisan attacks, pay to play, horrible lies, and dangerous levels of gaslighting. It has been almost a year and they control the entire government and have yet to accomplish anything with it after 2 years of claiming to be a walking god.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From what I hear, many people who are not Trump voters, did not like at all the idea of a Trump President, are becoming suspicious of the enormous amount of coverage he gets, particularly on places like CNN. People are perplexed by it. The huge journalistic endeavor you speak of is not normal. And people know that politicians are all dirty to some extent and that &#39;stuff goes on&#39; to a certain degree, so the level of attention Trump has been getting and the fact that he won despite all of them saying he wouldn&#39;t - I have heard people confused about this fact and what is going on in the media. People do begin to see it as biased. All but the rabid anti-Trump lot who are just as bad as the rabid pro-Trump lot. The true awakening begins for people when they understand that there is just as much, if not more, Clinton corruption and yet that is covered up and dismissed while similar or lesser crimes from the Trump camp are seized upon and blared out constantly.</p>

<p>And I say that as a Democrat. I disagree with Republican policies but I can see that Clinton was an out and out criminal and the whole establishment including the media is trying to protect her. many people see that and it scares them.</p>

<p>If this were true, our current corrupt admin would prosecute her, and if they aren&#39;t corrupt they would still see her crimes and fairly prosecute her but it seems even our current biased &quot;lock her up&quot; DOJ cannot dig the dirt to prosecute her after like 40 years of public service.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Gotta hand it to you: your deductive faculties are at least sound enough to aproximate my religious beliefs, but your social interactive and charismatic persuation skills leave a bit to be desired.</p>

<p>Attacking my personal faith - one with which you cannot possibly begin to dispute or discount with any measure of authority - on the basis of your own misdirected anger fed with hubris only deflects attention from the point you wished to make, and threatens to dismantle your future credibility as one desirous to influence a conversation.</p>

<p>Also, since you mention it, not even the most secular scholars dispute the historicity of Jesus of Nazareth, nor that of the Gospel&#39;s accounts of His life as found in the first four books of the New Testament.  I&#39;d be more than happy to debate this with you, and am even willing to say that, at the very least, you&#39;d have no defense against the objective facts available.  But I wager I could convince you, at least on an intellectual and academic level, that you&#39;re completely wrong.  The rest would be up to the very One whom you claim is fiction.</p>

<p>Jesus is very real, my friend.  Of all the knowledge of all the things in all times within and without the entire universe, that is the only fact which your choice to believe will determine the outcome of your eternity.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You really think that someone who is a blatant troll can get people who don&#39;t already believe in conspiracy theories like 9/11 to believe in them?  </p>

<p>The only people who give an credence to Q are people who already believe so deeply in their worldview that they&#39;re willing to ignore the fact that someone is a complete liar as long as that person confirms their world view.  </p>

<p>Someone like Q (by which I mean the almost certainly legion number of people who post as Q on 4Chan because that&#39;s how 4Chan works you know) has the opposite effect of what you hope for. Reasonable people who might otherwise be led to believe in conspiracies like 9/11 see obviously stupid posts by Q and then see people on a conspiracy sub giving them credence and conclude that the whole thing is stupid.  </p>

<p>If you want to convince people to believe in theories, give them actual evidence. Don&#39;t post stupid anonymous posts with juvenile questions like &quot;who&#39;s really in charge?&quot; Give them real, verifiable facts. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’ve been around conspiracy theories for some time now, and I’ve heard this before. I respectfully disagree.  I don’t believe that these things are the beginning of the end of rational thinking for MOST people who read and get absorbed by them. I think they are the beginning of a never ending process by which people who could not imagine such complexity existing, now have their eyes forced open. They are forced to consider uncomfortable possibility. They are forced to begin analyzing problems outside of the paradigm they’re used to.</p>

<p>I can tell you without the shadow of a doubt that reading conspiracies has made me a more analytical, rational, open minded, and interested person. I care abbot subtly now where once I did not. I want to know details that I never would have asked about before. I want to understand motives better.</p>

<p>In other words, I’ve come to believe that what people call “conspiracy theories” make people better long term. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>i agree with you.</p>

<p>however, i will offer this anecdote. When I first learned to play poker I became a follower of r/poker. After a few weeks of gathering tips and finding better forums for the game I realized that the reddit sub for poker was more akin to children falling over themselves and offering bad advice with next to know real experience. 
After discovering other sources for information regarding &#39;conspiracies&#39; I have realized that r/conspiracy is much like this. it&#39;s the first place people come for questions because it&#39;s the easiest to find and it&#39;s also the place where you get the worst disorganized and unverified made up narratives with out much meat to them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>How is it dangerous? I hate it when people call others discussing their ideas and presenting information as &#39;dangerous.&#39; That&#39;s the kind of talk that is used to censor. It is not dangerous for people to discuss things, even crazy off the wall ideas. If you spent time here you&#39;d see that people ask for evidence, some people are quick to believe anything but the majority want evidence for claims.</p>

<p>Not having a place to discuss these ideas and theories and to put forward evidence and information that contradicts official narratives would be far more dangerous in my opinion. I feel that I can trust the majority here to be able to discern fact from fiction or real possibility from crazy talk. It&#39;s not for me or you or anyone else to decide what narratives others should or should not believe. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. Before I understood that many so-called conspiracy theories were actually real, I had a deep sense of fear and mistrust of the people who believed something differently to me. I couldn&#39;t understand their point of view so I made assumptions about them that they must be stupid or hateful etc. But when you understand that many cnspiracy theories are real, or even when you understand that the media lies and that the people who know that have no idea where to turn or what to believe, it makes everything and everyone make a whole lot more sense. It makes it easier to see everyone&#39;s point of view, especially when you have had your own point of view so thoroughly debunked and changed. It makes you cling to what you can prove, to be open to every possibility but to seek evidence for any theory. It makes you great at the scientific method, and realise how few people actually practice that method in their thinking, even scientists!</p>

<p>As for me, i&#39;m no &#39;Trump Supporter&#39; but to call him worse than what we have seen is not genuine. First, congress and the senate haven&#39;t really allowed him to do anything - it&#39;s Obama 2.0. Everything they have done is pretty common sense stuff that everyone agrees on (in the majority). I think it&#39;s all &#39;chicken little&#39; sky-is-falling hyperbole from his opponents, so it makes me stick up for the reality of things. I think at some point, people need to move on and try to be productive with their time and energy, but i&#39;m just a person on the internet.</p>

<p>Wasn&#39;t your original argument something like &quot;anti-Trump posts on <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> get a bunch of upvotes therefore bots&quot; ?

    <div class="md"><p>That &quot;analytical evidence&quot; is only comparing one of the most active subs (the Donald) to others that just simply aren&#39;t as active. Compare it to r/ NBA or some other sub where users are constantly active and up voting. You didn&#39;t show evidence of the script being used. You posted a screenshot of a script.</p>

<p>And I don&#39;t doubt that subs get brigaded. But to argue over that is kind of trivial. We&#39;re talking about one sub in the Donald, that&#39;s brigaded by the rest of Reddit. The Donald has almost 600,000 subscribers, how many people are on reddit as a whole? </p>

<p>When an article critical of vastly unpopular President Trump gets posted to a sub like <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>, which has over 3.5 million subscribers, gets 40k upvotes, why do you think it is because of vote manipulation? Because that is what you originally said.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Probably because the post got enough votes to hit <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> and subsequent upvotes aren&#39;t coming from subscribers? Overall, Reddit has always been a left-leaning site so it makes sense that when even a niche subreddit like <a href="/r/enoughtrumpspam">/r/enoughtrumpspam</a> hits the front page people will upvote it, especially when, at the time, everyone was used to seeing simiilar posts from T_D hit the front (and then get downvoted to oblivion by <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a>).</p>

<p>Even if you don&#39;t believe its bots or scripts, it&#39;s still almost universally just spam that gets blanket upvoted. There is no meaningful discussion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That &quot;analytical evidence&quot; is only comparing one of the most active subs (the Donald) to others that just simply aren&#39;t as active. Compare it to r/ NBA or some other sub where users are constantly active and up voting. You didn&#39;t show evidence of the script being used. You posted a screenshot of a script.</p>

<p>And I don&#39;t doubt that subs get brigaded. But to argue over that is kind of trivial. We&#39;re talking about one sub in the Donald, that&#39;s brigaded by the rest of Reddit. The Donald has almost 600,000 subscribers, how many people are on reddit as a whole? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Probably because the post got enough votes to hit <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> and subsequent upvotes aren&#39;t coming from subscribers? Overall, Reddit has always been a left-leaning site so it makes sense that when even a niche subreddit like <a href="/r/enoughtrumpspam">/r/enoughtrumpspam</a> hits the front page people will upvote it, especially when, at the time, everyone was used to seeing simiilar posts from T_D hit the front (and then get downvoted to oblivion by <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a>).</p>

<p>Even if you don&#39;t believe its bots or scripts, it&#39;s still almost universally just spam that gets blanket upvoted. There is no meaningful discussion.</p>
