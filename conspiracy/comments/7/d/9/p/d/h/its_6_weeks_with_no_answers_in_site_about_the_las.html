    <div class="md"><p>Would you? Even if it could put a target on ur back and those that love you? If they speak out saying it was a set up they become a liability. I think a lawyer and a civil suit is better. Ur not rocking the boat and endangering those you love. Just my thoughts tho.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think speaking out necessarily implies speaking against the accepted narrative. They could be speaking out to demand answers as to why Paddock was able to port 23+ guns into the hotel, for example. Or they could speak out to demand answers as to why it took so long for LVPD to respond.</p>

<p>That stuff I would not expect to result in a target on anyone&#39;s family because it supports the official narrative. It&#39;s just asking for details and maybe setting the stage for compensation via lawsuit.</p>

<p>I&#39;m also not sure the victim&#39;s family would even think in terms of their speaking out resulting in some sort of further harm. Remember, this is a national tragedy, even with the questions it raises. Nobody (besides the scant minority in r/conspiracy and similar sites) questions their victimhood. </p>

<p>Chances are the families accept the official narrative, but want some kind of justice, and one way to get that is to organize. I think the OPs point is that out of 20,000+ victim families (remember, even those who weren&#39;t injured are still victims) there should be more organizing and cage rattling going on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My honest thought is that they have lawyers. Even if they didn&#39;t seek out one..you can bet that lawyers came to them. </p>

<p>I&#39;m aware everyone there was a victims injured or not. Between lawyers and the overall not wanting to be bashed, followed, maybe harmed or called a liar they stay silent in the public eye. Just because we don&#39;t hear them doesn&#39;t mean they aren&#39;t speaking. Contacting the police and FBI directly may be what they are doing. Victims have received death threats from those that believe it was a hoax. </p>

<p>These same NSA sources are now saying the mass shooting that took place in Las Vegas on October 1 was an attempt by mercenaries working for the G4S security company (<a href="http://www.g4s.com/">http://www.g4s.com/</a>) hired by George Bush Sr. to create a distraction in order to kill U.S. President Donald Trump and Saudi Crown Prince Muhammad Bin Sultan (MBS).  Trump and MBS were meeting in secret at the suites in the Mandalay Bay Hotel, owned by MBS, to discuss the mass arrest of the perpetrators of the 9/11 terror attacks, these sources say.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah. Also, Paddock&#39;s estate and Live Nation. Doesn&#39;t mean they will win but they can sue. I also suspect that many of them saw the circus that was unleashed on Campos and they don&#39;t want that to happen to them. People went crazy trying to hunt Campos down. Imagine if the victims were in the spotlight. They would never have a moments peace. They would get followed, accused of lying and possibly even harmed because some feel like they are lying. </p>

<p>Govt Involvement: whether it&#39;s a fast and furious type FBI arms deal gone wrong, or an actual ISIS attack (as the group claimed) perpetrated by individuals the CIA were aware of, or even tracking, or both, or something entirely different but similar, their would be clear motive for the agencies to want to cover it up or risk Trump being able to burn them to the ground</p>

<p>Intentionally created chaos to allow for escape: this comes up with the assassination plot ideas related to the Saudis. While far fetched, The Four Seasons was only a few floors up and owned in part by a Saudi who was arrested during the November purge, so there&#39;s definitely some smoke there.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying any of these things happened. I&#39;m saying given what we actually know about the case, any or all of these are plausible. Pending more info, I don&#39;t believe this was a lone gunman. The authorities are clearly hiding something.</p>

How is Puerto Rico&#39;s power going? I saw a thread on reddit that it&#39;s been 50+ days with no power. I did not know it&#39;s 50+ days until I saw the thread being no one talks about it anymore.

<p>When the last shooting happened, CNN covered it and stressed gun control for like a week.</p>

<p>But otherwise yeah, no one is focusing on it because it pretty much seems impossible to get gun control. House, senate, and executive power are all controlled by Republicans. The next chance at gun control won&#39;t be until at least the 2018 election (if that changes anything)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This isn’t at all what I’m talking about. No one in that article came close to calling out a lack of transparency by the police or frustration at a lack of clear timeline thus far out. I literally googled looking for that sort of thing earlier in the evening before I saw this post.</p>

<p>It’s not like you would jeopardize your lawsuit by publicly asking for more answers from the police. Families demanding answers has been a key mechanism in forcing facts out to the public. This was the largest mass shooting in our country in living memory. Not just the victims &amp; their families, but the public deserves answers. </p>

Because they know they can&#39;t approach the theory that if it is a false flag and if the guvmint was behind it in some way, it means that trump, their god emperor, is behind it. they can&#39;t come out and start claiming what they did during the Obama years because their comrade is in office so they just push it aside while that thorn in the back of their mind, that their god emperor is a traitor, just can&#39;t be removed so they just glom onto more hillary and obama conspiracies. it&#39;s sad really but most are not us citizens anyway so they don&#39;t give a shit either way.</p>

<p>And especially if the objective of the false flags are to promote gun control, it would make no sense for the right to even continue committing false flags.</p>

<p>I&#39;m in no way saying that this is 100% a false flag and that only Obama and the left could be responsible for. But what I am saying, is that just because Trump is president, doesn&#39;t mean that all false flags since his inauguration are under his orders (just like it doesn&#39;t mean that previous false flags were directly under Obama&#39;s orders).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A president doesn’t need to know about a false flag. A lot of people think the president is just a face and he has people behind the scenes calling all the shots anyways. I recall a lot of theories regarding bush not knowing about 9-11 until he was told in the classroom. Obviously he was told about a plane hitting the buildings then. But that’s not what I mean. Anyways, the government is a rouge entity right now, the alphabet boys are playing by their own rules. Maybe the Don did have something to do with it, maybe it didn’t. What should concern you is families and citizens not speaking out in Las Vegas. Not what some subreddit is doing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>While it&#39;s not totally disingenuous to suggest a president doesn&#39;t &#39;need&#39; to know about a false flag, you at least made a reasoned and non-insane response in trying to defend that statement. But the td/alex jones/alt right brigade constantly labeled every mass shooting incident or international terror event a false flag during the Obama years and lay the blame squarely on Obama and Hillary. they still do as if Hillary is president instead of a has-been political loser. This happened before, during and now after Obama so no, a president doesn&#39;t &#39;need&#39; to know but it seems to be more convenient when it&#39;s a D vs an R president that suddenly they aren&#39;t in the loop and it&#39;s just a globalist conspiracy to destroy our american way of life and turn the frogs gay.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with that for sure. People seemed to think Obama was in on the “deep state” and Trump is this outsider. I fell for that thought for a split second. Who’s to say trump isn’t just some Trojan horse type shit? Or a wolf in sheep herders clothing? Don’t wanna make this all about trump, but I want to believe he’s some savior, but if he was going to take down any shadow government he would’ve never been allowed to run for president. Sometimes I kick around a wishful theory similar to Putin’s rise to power. Playing the political game while putting loyal supporters in positions of power. Once you get in good with the corrupt you turn on them. But again, that’s probably the least likely scenario we’re looking at. </p>

People are afraid to be labeled &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot; and that fear has become an effective censorship tool. The public deserves answers, and acting like anyone who still questions what happened here is nuts is a big part of the problem. </p>

<p>These same NSA sources are now saying the mass shooting that took place in Las Vegas on October 1 was an attempt by mercenaries working for the G4S security company (<a href="http://www.g4s.com/">http://www.g4s.com/</a>) hired by George Bush Sr. to create a distraction in order to kill U.S. President Donald Trump and Saudi Crown Prince Muhammad Bin Sultan (MBS).  Trump and MBS were meeting in secret at the suites in the Mandalay Bay Hotel, owned by MBS, to discuss the mass arrest of the perpetrators of the 9/11 terror attacks, these sources say.</p>

<p>Where are the families of the victims demanding answers/justice?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nowhere, because they don&#39;t exist. Never have. It was just another operation to undermine democracy in the US. Remember MH370 and the relentless families that were demanding answers for months? That&#39;s how the families of the Vegas shooting, and countless other mass shootings in the US for that matter, should be behaving. Yet there are next to none, many just behave like bad actors and the whole thing is swept under the rug without any proper answers in a matter of days with the killer almost always being neutralized conveniently right away since dead men tell no tales.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure, some real people usually die in these incidents by being at the wrong time at wrong place as well and that&#39;s indeed unfortunate. No disrespect to them. But in the greater scheme of things that is sadly only collateral damage as harsh as it may sound and not the point. Not to mention one thing is what is being told and what actually happened. Majority of these events and their select elements are staged one way or another to push similar agendas. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>MH370 is a little different because the media, especially Don Lemon at CNN was covering the story till the cows came home, I think 3 months? Every. single. night. This story, they were almost told to stfu about it or else, and they supposedly found the killer so it&#39;s not a huge mystery with search teams working every day, it&#39;s basically just a crazy guy who bought a bunch of guns and killed people so the media can wrap up the story with a nice bow. Some families are just content to believe the narrative because it hurts less than knowing the government killed their loved ones. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is the part I find most curious about the entire affair at this point.</p>

<p>Where are the aggrieved family members demanding answers? And where is MSM hunting them down to shove mics in their faces?</p>

<p>I know of an attorney building a class action suit, so his direct clients may have been advised to stay silent in order to not pollute the case. But that doesn’t account for <em>all</em> family members of <em>all</em> deceased and <em>all</em> wounded.</p>

<p>I’m still waiting for somebody to find a wallet with a Saudi passport and receipts for all ammo, etc. somewhere in the hotel.</p>

<p>We are now at mass shootings involving 3 or more people almost every single damn day here, and nothing&#39;s changed.  The gun lobby has its hand so far up the asses of our elected officials that nothing will be done about our mass firearm intoxication.  We have no money and apparently no desire to address the mental health of ANYONE living here, let alone the murderous crazies with the guns.  </p>

<p>We&#39;re already beginning to accept that it&#39;s just another day here, nothing&#39;s changed and nothing apparently WILL change as a result of children&#39;s deaths, mothers&#39; deaths, fathers&#39; deaths, SENATOR&#39;s attempted deaths, etc.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you start with the hypothesis that no one was shot or killed, then all that we have seen and heard since the event, including the fact that Crisis Cast was recruiting for a large scale drill in Vegas a couple weeks prior, falls into place and stacks up overwhelmingly in favor of that hypothesis. This is abductive reasoning.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think speaking out necessarily implies speaking against the accepted narrative. They could be speaking out to demand answers as to why Paddock was able to port 23+ guns into the hotel, for example. Or they could speak out to demand answers as to why it took so long for LVPD to respond.</p>

<p>That stuff I would not expect to result in a target on anyone&#39;s family because it supports the official narrative. It&#39;s just asking for details and maybe setting the stage for compensation via lawsuit.</p>

<p>I&#39;m also not sure the victim&#39;s family would even think in terms of their speaking out resulting in some sort of further harm. Remember, this is a national tragedy, even with the questions it raises. Nobody (besides the scant minority in r/conspiracy and similar sites) questions their victimhood. </p>

<p>Chances are the families accept the official narrative, but want some kind of justice, and one way to get that is to organize. I think the OPs point is that out of 20,000+ victim families (remember, even those who weren&#39;t injured are still victims) there should be more organizing and cage rattling going on.</p>
