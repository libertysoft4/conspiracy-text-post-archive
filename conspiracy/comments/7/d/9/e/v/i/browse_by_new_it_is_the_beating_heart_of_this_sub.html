        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I only got on r/conspiracy for the first time all day about an hour ago, and lots of people are freaking out. There are people discussing bans and shilling, which is pretty normal, but there is also some strange vote manipulation happening. I&#39;ve watched a comment go from +4 to -8 in the span of 20 minutes. </p>

<p>With that said, it is important that everyone, regardless of your political ideology or ideas about this sub, browse by /new first and foremost. Browsing by /new gives <em>you</em> the opportunity to set the tone of discussion. It let&#39;s <em>you</em> fight the shills, bots, and bad actors first hand. It lets <em>you</em> control the sub. Forget the front page, by the time a post is there the battle is already over for better or for worse.</p>

<p>If you care about this sub, its integrity, and its well being, you <em>must</em> browse by /new. Don&#39;t feel obligated to post in every new thread, just jump in where you feel you have something to contibute. Submit articles and self-posts too! Put time and effort into each comment and post submission and help keep this sub alive. Don&#39;t leave. I left r/politics when it was subverted, I left r/wikileaks, I left r/sandersforpresident. I refuse to leave r/conspiracy. Don&#39;t. Give. Up. This is a multi-partisan appeal. I don&#39;t care what your politics are, just engage in a collegial manner and browse by /new, that&#39;s all you gotta do.</p>

<p>To all you real ones out there- Keep up the fight. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I saw this too.  Now why wouldn&#39;t that be reported globally?  Here we all are living under the assumption that the plague fizzled out centuries ago thanks to hygiene &amp; antibiotics... and it still looks like those negate it quickly, which is great.  But why isn&#39;t this taught in school, or even discussed on the news?  Apparently Bubonic plague isn&#39;t &quot;dirty&quot; enough laundry... or it is so dirty it can&#39;t be discussed?</p>

<p>Not sure whether to blame the idiocracy that society embraces or the subversive media that keeps us fat &amp; happy consuming garbage.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.esquire.com/news-politics/a13515042/roy-moore-14-year-old-alabama-gop-defend/">There have been many Republicans who have defended his actions</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Take Joseph and Mary. Mary was a teenager and Joseph was an adult carpenter. They became parents of Jesus. There’s just nothing immoral or illegal here. Maybe just a little bit unusual,” said Alabama State Auditor Jim Ziegler.</p>

<p>&quot;It was 40 years ago,&quot; Alabama Marion County GOP chair David Hall tells me. &quot;I really don&#39;t see the relevance of it. He was 32. She was supposedly 14. She&#39;s not saying that anything happened other than they kissed.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Other than being with an underage person - he didn&#39;t really force himself,&quot; Alabama Geneva County GOP chairman Riley Seibenhener tells me. &quot;I know that&#39;s bad enough, but I don&#39;t know. If he withdraws, it&#39;s five weeks to the election...that would concede it to the Democrat.&quot;</p>

<p>Alabama Geneva County GOP chairman Riley Seibenhener, who called me back, says he doesn&#39;t believe the allegations are true, but if they&#39;re true he won&#39;t support him - but, at the same time, it&#39;s not &quot;forcible rape.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I know that 14-year-olds don&#39;t make good decisions,&quot; he adds.</p>

<p>Go ahead and acknowledge that someone <em>is</em> pushing that story hard, I have no problem with that, but don&#39;t use that observation to discredit the information. </p>

<p>If the information is able to be discredited, then discredit it on it&#39;s own merit. I have a hard time believing that it is possible for any reasonable person to watch those videos of Joe Biden interacting with small girls and think that they&#39;re completely normal. </p>

<p>Someone might be pushing the story because they want to discredit Biden, but if Biden has done these things and no one&#39;s called him out, does it actually matter who is pushing the info? Those videos aren&#39;t faked and this isn&#39;t a one time &quot;mistake&quot; those videos are showing a pattern of behavior.  </p>

<p>saying anything that is even remotely calling them out for this instantly hits you with hundreds of downvotes</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And yet here you sit at only 4 downvotes. You are the one that is irrational here, nobody has based their identity around hating Trump. Yeah there are some who are obsessed, but on the other hand you come off as being obsessed by them. Its a weird cycle, just take a deep breath man.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Visit /new to engage with the community at the most basic level. It gives you the opportunity to start a conversation by being among the first to post in a thread. What you say then and there will influence the trajectory of the post going forward. The tone and direction are already set by the time a post reaches /hot. This is why it&#39;s important. It also how you fight shills and bots, by denying them the opportunity to set their agenda. </p>

<p>The conspiracy twitter account used to be active and had the effect of following the the &quot;new&quot; page.  When it went dead it made it harder for me to follow/view new posts.</p>

<p>Seemed like censorship.</p>

<p>if you care about this sub, get that twitter functionality restored.  Or provide another feed like way to browse new reddit posts.</p>

<p>There are shill accounts literally spamming new with fucking bullshit about Moore and Biden right now.  Which means the shills just got some funding for their latest narrative.</p>

<p>If you’re reading this, how’s Moscow today?  I hope it’s freezing and your patties are rotten you cunts.</p>

<p>And as for shareblue?  Is this how you see DEMOCRACY now?  Being paid by the elite to spread your shit around the internet?</p>

<p>Fuck all of them.</p>
