<p>Fair point</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Hmm... I really haven&#39;t made up my mind on cultural relativism in retrospect when it&#39;s not to remove blame but to understand. Is excusing a type of behaviour the same as accepting it?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>men are attracted to young girls</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s back to the non-active pedo/hebophilia discussion and is moot. I can&#39;t accuse somebody not diddling youngsters of being a child abuser, on the other hand I can&#39;t accept people who abuse young people - and the reported behaviour is abusive.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There is also the usual deflection to bringing up muh creepy Joe Biden.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I checked out some of the images and videos of Joe Biden in regards to creepy uncle. To me it seems that some of the kids try to avoid his (to me) inappropriate attention and while it&#39;s not abusive it&#39;s creepy as fuck. Not that that&#39;s directly related to Moore.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Nah, I don&#39;t have any interest in the particular case. In this post I&#39;m here for the metadiscussion.</p>

<p>Well, I consider myself a real person. And rational. Whether or not <em>you</em> do might be affected by my next statement.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s an oversimplification of the problem. But to respond in an oversimplified manner... No. Pedophilies shouldn&#39;t be in prison. Abusers should.</p>

<p>And before anybody goes off the rail, &quot;abuse&quot; includes a &quot;consensual&quot; relationship between adults and children. </p>

<p>Abusers should go to jail, repeat offenders should have their sexual drive chemically suppressed. Abusers who refuse medicinal treatment to curb their abusive behaviour should be removed from society on a permanent basis, either through imprisonment or euthanasia. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I completely agree with there needs to be some investigating done to definitively say whether the allegations are true or false, not this meandering flood of accusations and speculation that seems to be going on, especially considering the election and how convenient the timing is to me all the more reason it needs to be confirmed either way true or false, if true he deserves to be punished in accordance with the law. (Even though there’s a lot of people including myself who think people who take advantage of and abuse minors get off way too easy. [no pun intended honest]). Why we don’t punish this more severely such as heavier sentences and/or castration is beyond me, as well as why they don’t just hang people that commit those crimes, I’m pretty sure if lawmakers grew a pair and starting hanging pedophiles/serving much harsher punishment, I think it’d be a great deterrent and reduce the amount of children being abused. (Then again why would the politicians wanna do that? If they did they’d have to start going after most of their own and god knows they aren’t, only time you’d get one to turn on others is when they wanted to save their own skin from pulling time and out someone else. The justice system is a joke and broken in many ways, but giving child rapists/pedo’s/ and abusers probation or a year-2 if that in prison compared to other non-violent crime or drug offenses is the biggest crack in the foundation of our justice system. </p>

<p>Besides the gray area of this as far as (to me) it seems nobody is going out of there way to pursue the truth. Sadly with all things in politics &amp; otherwise, there will be people who will still support him even if it is proved he’s abused minors and sexually assaulted women as well as opponents who will latch onto any negative allegations and run with it even if untrue or yet to be proven for financial gain.</p>

<p>I also agree with the other commenter up top that children CANNOT consent to sex with an adult under any circumstances, the fact that we as a country and society feel that it’s reasonable and needed to have a discussion on the matter about whether or not it’s wrong in some situations, is completely egregious and heinous IMO, it’s simply wrong, a grown man having sex with a 13yo is wrong on every level and terribly sick. This is definitely  one of the lowest points in society where there’s politicians and others who are trying to justify it or rationalize the issue and say it’s not wrong, (or in Moore’s case it wasn’t because he “asked the parents permission &amp; held public office at the time). 
Idgaf who you are, who you know, where you’re from, what office/power/money/influence you hold, taking advantage of children and abusing them </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You do have to admit though, that shit is pretty creepy.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not ok to have sex with minors but the only &quot;evidence&quot; thus far is a note in a yearbook, everything else has been heresay. Sometimes people lie, remember the Duke Lacrosse case? </p>

<p>Is it fair to cast guilt on someone without due process? Why have none of these women filed a civil suit? </p>

<p>You should be able to understand why people are questioning the allegations. </p>

<p>Personally, I think he&#39;s likely guilty. But if I was in a Juty with the evidence presented thus far I wouldn&#39;t be able to convict him beyond a reasonable doubt as required by law.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The general idea amongst people who know about the <em>red box</em> is that there are many worse politicians who skate. These allegations came up during re-election at an opportune political time. </p>

<p>When a group of organic efforts uncovered shady dealings in leaked emails and public concern was initiated over Pedogate, across a number of specific, localized areas (DC, Hollywood) the reaction was adversarial and belligerent by the media. They refused to promote or answer any questions, instead, &#39;debunking&#39; anything related to it outright.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t to say the allegations were true or untrue. It&#39;s not about that. It&#39;s about an organic public crisis that was ignored, then deflected into political posturing and realigned to Moore and others, promoted and disseminated to alleviate the superficial followers into a sense of justice by singling out low lying fruit.</p>

<p>These are the optics of the situation or timeline at least.</p>
