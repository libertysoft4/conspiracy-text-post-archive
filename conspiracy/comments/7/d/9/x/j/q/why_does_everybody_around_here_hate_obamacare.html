    <div class="md"><p>They aren&#39;t confused. Each state defines who is eligible for medicaid, and poverty alone isn&#39;t an automatic qualification. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, passed in 2010, would have revised and expanded Medicaid eligibility starting in 2014. Under the law as written, states that wished to participate in the Medicaid program would be required to allow people with income up to 133% of the poverty line to qualify for coverage, including adults without dependent children.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course, the supreme court ruled that states can opt out of the expansion, and with that opt out of the new requirement that included adults with no dependent children. </p>

<p>Before the ACA, medicaid didn&#39;t require adults without dependents to be eligible. The typical groups that were eligible were poor children, poor parents of eligible children, pregnant women, and people with disabilities. As an example: in California an adult with no dependents and no qualifier other than poverty wasn&#39;t eligible until mid-2011, and was only eligible in certain counties before 2014.</p>

<p>The last time I looked, there were ~18 states that haven&#39;t expanded medicaid. I haven&#39;t looked at each of their eligibility requirements in detail, but generally speaking if you live in one of those states, aren&#39;t on disability, don&#39;t have a dependent child, and aren&#39;t over 65, you don&#39;t qualify. </p>

unless their State,  accepted the ACA expansion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Something else to ponder is that with Obamacare came EHR(electronic health records). This mandated that all doctors converted to electronic medical records at the expense of the healthcare facility, and this would eventually (not sure the current status of this) feed into a national database that all doctors could access. So now, pretty much every patient in America has their entire medical history in a database. And while I&#39;m not sure how accessible that info is, there are many privacy laws at the moment that protect patient confidentiality, the info is out there. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like how you omitted your monthly premium payment for such a policy.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve had a plan under obamacare for 2+ years.  First year, had a gold plan with great coverages for $350 month.  </p>

<p>Next year that plan was cancelled and a comparable plan went up 35% in premiums....however it actually had less coverage.  So I had to downgrade to bronze in order to afford a plan but it still had co-pays.</p>

<p>Last year, my plan increased 89% in one fucking year.  Yep that means the premiums almost doubled.  Not only that, instead of co-pay, everything was switched to co-insurance.  A subtle but VERY significant difference.</p>

<p>So the tl;dr:  </p>

<ul>
<li>premiums increasing each year, almost doubling last year<br/></li>
<li>coverage amounts decreasing each year<br/></li>
<li>due to the above, everyone is having to downgrade to lower plans even if you have never made one claim.<br/></li>
<li>co-pays are switching to co-insurance<br/></li>
<li>none of this addresses the costs of providing services which are skyrocketing to stratospheric levels.</li>

<p>Personally I do not care for it because my premiums went up steadily for the last 3 years. In 2017 I have been paying almost $350 a month for coverage, after a subsidy. That is not ok. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’d like to know where you found that. Mine is 550 a month with a 6000 deductible. I get a $150 credit so that puts me out of pocket 400 a month plus if I have to use it I have an additional 100 a month in to a HSA and hope I don’t get sick for 5 years so I will have my deductible saved up by then.  That’s my Obamacare plan in a nut shell</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People that work actually are paying for the people who don’t work to have insurance. That is basically what it boils down to. When I was laid off in 2010 I went back in to the restaurant industry and made like 29k the first year and actually qualified for Medicaid which was free and cost me $30 anytime I did anything. It was 100% coverage. I used it for 6 months until I retained other employment and received my own insurance through my employer, once again paying about $300 a month with a $4000 annual deductible. In this instance I believe it is a good benefit.  Similar to an unemployment benefit. I do not think that people should be able to have this indefinitely. I have friends that won’t make more than 30k a year so they can keep their Medicaid. They would rather not pay for it and make less money when in fact if you add that benefit to their current 30k salary with premiums and deductible they would be making 48k, 18k of that being tax free. So why not. </p>

<p>Can you blame them? When you&#39;re looking to switch jobs, you of course compare compensation. Obviously there&#39;s salary, but you also look at benefits and other perks. If you make 30k, have medicaid, and insurance matters to you then a 40k job that doesn&#39;t have a good insurance plan is going to leave less money in their pocket. If you had a job offer for an extra 5k yearly but you knew your insurance premiums would cost you 5k more and would have an even higher deductible, you&#39;d be crazy to take it. Unless the friends you mentioned could double their salary in one jump, like your move from the service industry back to your career, their standard of living will suffer.</p>

<p>When there&#39;s a range of salaries that make too much to qualify for medicaid but not enough to make up for the loss, you end up with people who need healthcare but can&#39;t jump past that range. That&#39;s a shitty situation. </p>

<p>Really, that&#39;s the start of an argument for some form of universal healthcare... If you don&#39;t have to worry about keeping your family covered, that range of salaries doesn&#39;t exist, and taking a raise wouldn&#39;t come with a lower standard of living.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They aren&#39;t confused. Each state defines who is eligible for medicaid, and poverty alone isn&#39;t an automatic qualification. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, passed in 2010, would have revised and expanded Medicaid eligibility starting in 2014. Under the law as written, states that wished to participate in the Medicaid program would be required to allow people with income up to 133% of the poverty line to qualify for coverage, including adults without dependent children.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course, the supreme court ruled that states can opt out of the expansion, and with that opt out of the new requirement that included adults with no dependent children. </p>

<p>Before the ACA, medicaid didn&#39;t require adults without dependents to be eligible. The typical groups that were eligible were poor children, poor parents of eligible children, pregnant women, and people with disabilities. As an example: in California an adult with no dependents and no qualifier other than poverty wasn&#39;t eligible until mid-2011, and was only eligible in certain counties before 2014.</p>

<p>The last time I looked, there were ~18 states that haven&#39;t expanded medicaid. I haven&#39;t looked at each of their eligibility requirements in detail, but generally speaking if you live in one of those states, aren&#39;t on disability, don&#39;t have a dependent child, and aren&#39;t over 65, you don&#39;t qualify. </p>

<p>No I did not confuse them. </p>

<p>Medicaid did not cover adults who don&#39;t have dependent  and are under age 65,
unless their State,  accepted the ACA expansion.</p>
