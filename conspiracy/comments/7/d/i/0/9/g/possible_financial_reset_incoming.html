        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This is encouraging and I hope it’s true. Both Rosanne and VOTL are saying Trump plans to wipe out the debt. </p>

<p>Rosanne did mention something about Americans being woke this week. I’m not sure what that is referring to since the week isn’t out but she is suddenly talking about Trump wiping out the debts owned to China and our own personal debts too.</p>

<p>Debt is obviously slavery so if Trump is for real, this is a must. </p>

<p>Basically, VOTL says that a lot of countries including China are sick of Rothschild debt so everyone has gone against the banking elite and planned out a whole financial reset which includes new currency and debt forgiveness. To square things up with China, Trump and the military that’s propping him up will take the money from the heavyweights such as the Rothschilds, Windsors, Soros, ect.. and settle what he can while privatizing any unpaid debt that remains so the public doesn’t have to deal with it. </p>

<p>Also, that coup in Africa was against a cabal shill who holds money for the cabal so he was replaced. </p>

<p>Debt slavery is real slavery so whatever happens, this shit show has to be flipped on its head and we need to enter a new era where people usually have excess money saved up in their bank accounts. There is no reason we cannot have that. The only reason we haven’t had that is because the cabal wanted debt slavery. Financial hardship has to be set aside once and for all so that people can worry about things that really matter. Ultimately the people are in charge so we have to basically expect this and nothing less. Even good politicians have to be held accountable.</p>

<p>some people think that&#39;s reasonable, some don&#39;t. but it&#39;s how i live and think about this world.</p>

<p>VOTL and Q both made specific predictions, that were quite extraordinary predictions, and none of them came true.</p>

<p>I was unaware that they are connected, but I&#39;m not surprised. As far as I can tell, VOTL is somewhere between an attention whoring LARPer and state sponsored disinfo that takes advantage of whatever is &quot;trending&quot; in the right-leaning conspiracy community.</p>

<p>they both had their chances, but when their predictions failed, and worse yet they then doubled down, i made my mind up about them.</p>

<p>i am open to new evidence, however, so if you know something i don&#39;t, i&#39;ll listen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>there were rumors he took a deal of sorts and the indictments are sealed. He very well may have been arrested and released and we wouldn&#39;t know any better. Also, the language is vague enough that he may have just been speaking of the indictments and conflated meaning with the word &#39;arrest&#39;. IMO, it&#39;s a bit overly punitive to completely dismiss it on that basis - we might just be arguing semantics here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the currency reset has been in play for a long time. If Trump, et. al., are trying to kick the banking dynasties out and form an alliance with CH and RU against them, America and Europe are in for a wild ride. If they&#39;re not, and that&#39;s a ruse, it&#39;s coming anyway from the present central bankers, and that will be our opportunity to refuse it and do something different.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t help but think that if we finally rid ourselves of the money snakes, they&#39;ll unleash all the hell they can while going down. They&#39;ll nuke Yosemite, wipe out power grids, hit AF1 with a sidewinder, take out DC, NY, London, Rome, nuke the New Madrid fault line, hit Fukushima with a kill-shot earthquake that submerges the rest of it.... shit like that. Because I&#39;ve been here too long.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So basically, if the GOP (Right) support the AIPAC (Israeli Interest) and the left as you claim are attempting to use some sort of Yugioh esq Anti-Antisemitism card, just waiting for the right time to attack, then why does Trump Lobby for Israel which was planned, formed and created by <strong>Rothschild?</strong></p>

<p>At what point would it benefit Trump to break a system that bolsters White Supremacy under the guise of helping God&#39;s chosen people? By incorporating alphabet organizations to move in and murder millions of people, sometimes under false pretenses? Why would Trump, who has obviously gotten an rouse out of white supremacist everywhere, globally at anytime, be against white supremacy which was also, planned, formed and created by <strong>Rothschild?</strong></p>

<p>The money won&#39;t fail because Trump is fighting some war against the creators of our system. It&#39;s going to fall because Trump is blindly isolating us from the rest of the world. Pride is what makes us fall in the end as a country.</p>

The Fed can print Zillions of dollars and hand it over to the 1% and that would leave the 99% in more shambles and lacking cash. The 1% is almost a different economy and they are doing so good that it doesn&#39;t even help them. Basically, all that money just sits in the bank account for decades. </p>

What do you think debt will not occur again? It will be a free society?  I think not. Very unfair for those of us that worked our asses off to pay off our debt responsibly  </p>
