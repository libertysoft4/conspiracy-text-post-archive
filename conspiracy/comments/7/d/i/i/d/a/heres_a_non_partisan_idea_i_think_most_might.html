<p>Honestly, who here thinks these people, these Elites, deserve to maintain positions of power indefinitely? The longer they have power, the more likely they are to be corrupt. The closer they are to their death bed, the more likely they&#39;ll make blatant cash grabs as a legacy for their family..</p>

<p>Does anyone disagree? How do we even get them to take away <em>their own power</em>? I think every single position should have a max term, is there any reason there shouldn&#39;t be?</p>

<p>I mean look at the election, or imagine the next one.. if more people got into politics, but had less time to use their power to advance their own interests, to try to use it to gain wealth.. eventually we would have more choices when it comes time to elect a president.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know, I know this isn&#39;t a political sub, but when you think about it, just about every topic we discuss here is a result of the same people maintaining power over us for too long.</p>

<p>Any thoughts? How we might do it?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I have seen it said most often in the Donald.. term limits.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is not an accident that Republicans like them.</p>

<p>Term limits rotate out elected officials, leaving corporate lobbyists as the veterans of DC. After <em>Citizens United</em>, term limits would be another huge strike against democracy.</p>

<p>I am aware that most of us do not like Bill Clinton, but imagine if he was allowed to run for a third term. He would have crushed George W. Bush. That would mean no massive expansion of middle east wars as per the PNAC agenda, and probably not even 9-11. Things would be very different.</p>

<p>But instead, the right of the people was taken away by the 22nd Amendment and we wound up with &quot;The Decider.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s an interesting hypothetical.. I&#39;m not so sure that Clinton would have prevented 9/11. Your argument is that it happened because of general incompetence.. I still have reason to believe it was performed by the government.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not a liberal, and I&#39;m guessing you are.. if I was going to compromise on the point, it would be that for any politician to continue, they must have a large majority of the vote while having someone within their own party running as well. If they can&#39;t secure say 65%+ of the vote, they can&#39;t remain in office.</p>

<p>Term limits and revamping the powers of lobbyists (there&#39;s a good link someone posted, anti corruption something rather) would get more new blood into politics, and ultimately give us a larger variety of people who can run for president in the end.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry, this post is mainly a result of the frustration of having really shitty choices last election, and not seeing better choices for the next one.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>reason to believe it was performed by the government.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As many of us know, this is the best description of 9-11. You read something into my comment that I did not say.</p>

<p>And which government did it? A mostly Republican government with a White House occupant installed by a 5-4 Supreme Court that ended the Florida vote count. Behind the scenes -- and most did not know it then -- was a cabal of warmongers called PNAC lusting for a &quot;new Pearl Harbor&quot; and three large scale wars, and even naming countries to attack. So, we probably agree here. </p>

<p>With that Republican plan in mind, it would be a huge leap to say that somehow a third Bill Clinton term would be the same. In fact, Bill Clinton was in office when a scheme to take down one of the Twin Towers was executed, and he did nothing like what PNAC would have done. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m not a liberal, and I&#39;m guessing you are.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The words liberal and conservative have been so distorted in the past 20 years as to be rendered meaningless.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>compromise .. while having someone within their own party running as well. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I like this idea, especially with the states themselves becoming so polarized that one party is often a shoe-in. This applies in both &quot;red&quot; and &quot;blue&quot; states. One major reason that there is so much corruption is because the national parties have set things up so that one party appears so far away from the other, that locally, elections are predetermined. This permits massive corruption in both parties whether it is in Chicago or Kansas.</p>

<p>Competition is needed. So, we probably agree here. </p>

<p>I suggest that in the most red and the most blue states, the parties split into local factions. Your idea is worth considering, but it immediately appears to be a logistical and regulatory nightmare of extreme complexity.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>more new blood into politics,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My original point was to oppose this, and I do so adamantly. We don&#39;t want the lobbyists to be the long-term experts in Congress. All that new blood would be very quickly reliant upon both the advice and the money of the veteran lobbyists. </p>

<p>To analogize, consider the &#39;revolving door&quot; of the &#39;deep state.&#39; In the White House, many of the same veterans are used to run policies across administrations and across parties. In Congress, that role would be played by lobbyists. I hope this changes your view, because it is solid. :)</p>

<p>Unfortunately, to change government, we need to become active. Infiltrate the parties until we have enough power to overturn them from the inside. That&#39;s what Indivisible and Our Revolution is trying to, and that&#39;s what Tea Party attempted until it filled with Koch and Bradley money.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because it is a slow process by a grassroots organization that doesn&#39;t have deep pockets.  Plus, there is already a significant amount of negative press being generated from what they&#39;ve accomplished so far (12 or 13 States have voted to participate- need about 33 States to begin the COS).  Most of the negative articles have been misleading and from misinformed sources at best.    </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t support it. Suppose we find actual experts we trust. Be it on a major issue, or just as a local who actually looks out for his constituents. What happens when they reach their term limits? We throw them out, even though we like them. Who picks the replacement candidates? The parties. We get no choice but a stooge. And if that expert had amassed influence nationally, what fills that void? Special interest money. The new term limit rules institutionalize the revolving door that congressmen do corporate bidding for a few years on the citizens&#39; dime, then get a cushy K Street job, to be replaced on the ballot by the guy whose job they are taking, etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Someone else made a similar comment, an easy compromise would be that when their term ends, they run against another candidate of their own party, and if they win by a certain margin then can be elected again.</p>

<p>What your comment fails to respond to is that the majority of these people have been in power 20+ years, some over 30. That isn&#39;t good for anyone. Younger people are more likely to want something that is currently important, while these established people will focus on keeping things the same.</p>

<p>At least that seems to be how it appears. Yes, something needs to be done about lobbyists at the same time, yes it isn&#39;t a simple issue.. but the system needs to evolve, badly. These people do not want that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You seem to be saying replacing everybody in Congress wholesale is going to mean that nobody there is bought and paid for, and that&#39;s just as ignorant. We&#39;d be entirely at the mercy of the parties for the selection of replacements. The parties, those private institutions that we have no legal standing to challenge.</p>

<p>I absolutely agree that the lobbying industry is the problem. Where we are disagreeing is that implementing term limits before we do anything about that problem is going to bring us closer to fixing it. I think if we do that, we are falling into a trap of giving away what little power we have left just because we want to change <em>something, anything</em>. The lobbyists will exploit the new term limit quicker than we can take advantage of them to destroy lobbyist influence. Because they are the lawyers writing the rules. And they have the access to the media, to tell the story of what&#39;s happening.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the best way to do it - (AND YES I AM VERY SERIOUS - WE COULD START IT RIGHT HERE TONIGHT)</p>

<p>The best best to do it - is to vote for the nonincumbent -- I mean I don&#39;t care who is running for senate/house etc - you vote for the guy who is new and never ever never ever vote for the candidate who is an incumbent - </p>

<p>If we could just convince everyone to do this without regard to political affiliation - I don&#39;t care about republican democrat - I just want to vote for the new/younger person. If we did this 3-4 elections in a row (and spread the word via every means possible) then we could make a positive change - quickly.</p>

<p>Instead of voting REP or DEM - vote NIP - (non-incumbent party)</p>

<p>The slogan writes itself!</p>

<p>Let&#39;s NIP this corruption in the bud right here!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll just say that Clinton won the popular vote despite rigging the election and being mired in more corruption than any candidate we&#39;ve known in history. If you add to that and say that Sanders would have won if she hadn&#39;t rigged it, I don&#39;t think anyone wants to get the blue haired money out of power.</p>

<p>In fact, the main liberal talking point about why Trump was bad was that he was inexperienced and didn&#39;t know anything about politics.</p>

<p>But now that he&#39;s in, he&#39;s just another establishment figurehead.</p>

<p>This us vs them mentality allows factions to spin a narrative as they desire, indifferent to truth or reason.</p>

<p>But at the end of the day, nobody is going to vote for a common sense baker who makes 30 grand a year.</p>

<p>It&#39;s all based on a cult of personality. Which is why Trump and Obama both got elected. For Obama, the timing was right to prove we&#39;re not racist, so policies aside he was a shoe in. For Trump, the timing was right after 8 years of democratic policies and sjwism.</p>

<p>The short answer is people are unbelievably stupid AND uneducated. It&#39;s more important to have a side and a belief than it is to have a reason and purpose.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like the people who complain about capitalism and wealth disparity then get on Amazon and buy their new thing for 40% off with 2 day shipping with their gmail account on their Windows PC/iPhone. Or they go to wal mart.</p>

<p>False flag attacks, led by the deep state, are determined to be necessary and serve to increase the overt power of the deep state so that the requisite counter-measures can be put in place prior to an organic and unplanned attack or revolt that would eventually occur on it&#39;s own. </p>

<p>Now, what would be super awesome is if this elite group of people were drunk with power and obsessed with military might and devolved of any ethics or system of moral guidance. Additionally, if they would meet in secret, dress in robes and engage in dark ceremonies and rituals while keeping their true identities masked- even from each other. Ideally, they would commit crimes against humanity as they seek to enslave the world into a system from which it cannot escape. Finally, they would reveal the fact that their true form was reptilian.</p>

Despite what many think of Biden (goofy, creepy, etc.) and McCain (old, flaky, etc), it is an undeniable fact that they a wealth of experience and knowledge around foreign policy. And, in many ways, our government depends on this knowledge and experience to guide decision making.<br/>
If you limit reps to three terms, that institutional memory is decreased. You don&#39;t have incredibly knowledgeable people serving in these positions. We&#39;ve actually seen symptoms of this from the Tea Party wave, wherein Republicans in the House actually complained about how newer members had no idea what was going on and lacked understanding of how to do anything.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This country is full of politicians, there wouldn&#39;t be a void because there&#39;s simply hundreds of people if not then that work on the state level, even more when you look at the county and city level.. people with plenty of experience that can&#39;t compete against their own party members working on the federal level.</p>

<p>At the very least make it so that at the 8 or 12 year mark they have to run against someone in their own party, and if they don&#39;t win by at least 60% of the vote, they lose their position. This keeps someone from exploiting the position uncontested forever.</p>

<p>And several people have made a good point that before anything like this happens, we need to kill the ability for lobbyists to make it profitable to be a public servant. I say kill any way for them to make money other than what the position pays.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t say there would be a void, but there would be a shortage of experience for sure. There&#39;s something to be said for having politicians with long-standing amicable relationships with foreign government representatives.<br/>
I&#39;m not sure I&#39;m opposed to the idea itself, but the problems that it could cause give me pause. There are much better ways to fix the problems in the system than by removing institutional memory and experience. Getting rid of lobbyists and banning corporate money entirely would be a much bigger/better step than term limits imo. Those tow are the biggest issues we have at this time in my perspective. If campaigns could only get donations from individual citizens and a federal fund, I&#39;d be much happier. If corporations could not write bills, I&#39;d be much happier.<br/>
You fix the money and term limits aren&#39;t an issue.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I still think that at some point, they should have to run against their own party, and that the people should get to vote on whether that person continues to maintain power.</p>

<p>I would also like to see the people in this country have more say, this &quot;call your senator&quot; bullshit isn&#39;t the way to do it. Regular citizens decide your fate when you break the law, regular citizens should be part of the system that creates our laws.</p>

<p>The problem is that these are public servants that obviously feel more like rulers. They make laws and policies that benefit them, and have the money to avoid the consequences if they choose to break the law.</p>

<p>Like the disparity between laws involving possession of crack versus cocaine, even though one is a derivative of the other, and actual contains less, the punishments for cocaine possession was far less harsh. If citizens were involved in law making, shit like that wouldn&#39;t be the case.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There should absolutely be a &quot;no&quot; option when voting. It is gross how many people run uncontested, and there should be a way to keep someone out of office. Nevada, for instance, has a &quot;None of the Above&quot; option on all ballots in the state. It is, however, a protest vote and the win still goes to the candidate with the most votes. Unfortunately, what you&#39;re proposing has an odd issue wherein it doesn&#39;t explain what happens if there is no opposition. You can&#39;t force someone to run an opposition campaign. I don&#39;t have an answer to that. I wish I did.<br/>
I would really like to see a massive change in how representation occurs in this country. I want to see a massive reapportionment of our government occur. During the Continental Congress there was a large debate about the size of congressional districts. They (the only time GW voiced an opinion) decided that the optimum size of a congressional district was 30,000 citizens per representative. The House was supposed to be reapportioned every 10 years. That stopped in 1929. I dunno what the ideal size is, but it isn&#39;t the average of one representative for every 700,000 (average across districts). I would love to see the size of the house increased and the average size of a district be closer to 30k.<br/>
I don&#39;t know if that would change everything, but it would make each citizen have more equal power and make more direct representation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Imagine you work for a company. You have a boss, and he has a boss.</p>

<p>Your boss remains forever, but his boss gets replaced every 4 years - who becomes the <em>real</em> person who knows everything and is in control?</p>

<p>The same thing happens with politicians - a politician who is replaced every X years becomes just a figurehead for the special interests/party. A politician who does NOT get termed out has at least a <em>chance</em> of doing something on his own (even if they rarely do).</p>

<p>Term limits are a panacea that replace candidates with parities, but make people <em>think</em> they&#39;re enacting something.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not sure if you really cruised the thread, but in multiple comments I and others have brought up that we need to kill lobbyists ability to make things profitable for term limits to have a positive effect.</p>

<p>There&#39;s also been a few good links posted that are worth checking out. Bottom line, this post was about discussing what can be done. There&#39;s obviously a problem, and it&#39;s worthy of discussion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Then why isn&#39;t this topic something I&#39;m seeing posted.. everywhere?</p>

<p>Left or right, it doesn&#39;t matter, I haven&#39;t seen anyone argue against this.. it&#39;s just something that dies out as an idea, something I think anyone should be supporting..</p>

<p>But this post will likely die because people aren&#39;t fighting for the obvious hard enough..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While everything mentioned there makes sense, getting any of that on the federal level sounds nearly impossible. And I still think term limits is a simpler first step that would reduce corruption more directly. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I think most would stand behind everything it says, I just think that would be difficult to push on the federal level.</p>
