<p>Kratom is a plant that is related to coffee and native to Southeast Asia. Lately, it has caught on in the West as people consume the leaf for its effects. The FDA are trying to ban Kratom because it helps opiate addicts come off drugs and cuts into their profits. They’re fighting this harder than anyone but we can stop them because we have power in numbers. </p>

<p>Call a Congressperson and let our voices be heard! We can stop them.</p>

<p>They’re all over the news saying that Kratom is “associated” with 36 deaths because 36 people died and Kratom was found in their system (along with other drugs such as pills.)</p>

<p>We all know that the drug war has failed, but if you’re going to attack Kratom, at least prove that it’s harmful. There’s literally NO scientific evidence to show that Kratom is toxic. </p>

<p>If you’re calling a republican congressperson, stress that this is America and if you’re going to make it illegal to consume a plant, then there is a burden of proof to at least demonstrate that it is harmful first. This is a free country.</p>

<p>If you’re calling a Democrat, appeal to their sensitivity, and remind them that people use this plant in place of harmful drugs such as opiates and benzodiazepines with little to no side effects.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sign this shit guys. There is no magic cure for opiate addiction but kratom comes close. So much better than anything a doc can prescribe you, I know from experience. If the pharmaceutical companies could patent this you bet it would be used for addicts already. There is absolutely no reason for kratom to be scheduled, it has very small recreational value. Not zero, but the help it can give far outweighs the harm. It&#39;s a shame it has hardly been researched for it benefits on those wishing to get clean. </p>

AKA&#39;s petition</p>

<p>Please take a few moments out of your day to sign this &amp; the above petition. Kratom has given me my life back. After a debilitating back injury, I refused to use opiates because of the way I have watched them poison other people. Before kratom, I was suicidal and had withdrawn from society. Not only did kratom make my pain manageable enough for me to have  a job and social life again, but it also has helped me to manage my depression and anxiety. My story is not unique. Help us fight Big Pharma &amp; their lapdogs, the FDA &amp; DEA! Sign these petitions, call your congressman, and spread awareness in your community! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I said this in another thread we just had on this subreddit, but I&#39;ve been completely clean of all drugs for over two years now (3 years in febuary) after over 6 years of IV heroin use and over 10 years of Opiate use. I tried to get clean many times. It never worked. It finally worked when I used kratom to get through the withdrawals. The withdrawals would always get to a point where I just had to give in and go steal some poppy seeds or call my dealer. But with kratom, it made it easy enough to get through. And getting off the kratom was easy as I was only on it for like 9 days. </p>

<p>Kratom is better option than Suboxone or Methadone. Suboxone and Methadone are still strong opiates and are addictive and has withdrawals that are almost as bad as Heroin. I&#39;m sure there&#39;s withdrawal with kratom but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s anywhere in the realm of heroin or suboxone or methadone.</p>

<p>Kratom can do more bad than good in the realm of the opiate world, and it seriously upsets me this guy wants to fuck that up when our country is struggling the way it is because of doctors, not because of kratom</p>
