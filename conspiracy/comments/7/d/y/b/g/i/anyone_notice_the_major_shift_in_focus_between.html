        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Very few if any focus on a specific party or political agenda. Posts focus on pizza gate or elsagate as a whole rather than individuals involved. In fact, there have been hardly any Roy Moore/Biden/whoever posts. A lot more big picture, discussion based posts rather than click baity titles and polarized comment sections. </p>

<p>I thought I noticed it last weekend, but figured I&#39;d wait and see if it played out the same way this weekend. Come Monday I&#39;m sure the cross post storm will be in full effect again. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Could be plenty of things:</p>

<p>Less click bait articles being written on the weekend so there&#39;s less to cross post. </p>

<p>Could be that a lot of people use Reddit at work and those using it on the weekend are looking for a different flavor of post. </p>

<p>Could be that there really are a lot of shills muddying the waters, but it doesn&#39;t really make sense that they&#39;d take weekends off from that--just have weekend shifts. </p>

<p>Those that post in the week do it because they are bored and want to troll. Those that post on the weekend are putting more thought into it. </p>

<p>Who knows, but I feel like almost every post on the weekend is interesting and the top posts cycle in and out quickly. During the week you&#39;ll have the same bs stories at the top of the sub for the majority of the page and sorting by New becomes more necessary. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It’s no coincidence an air force base in Colorado is the city with the most Reddit user activity. Most people have off on the weekend, so there is a less of a chance for propaganda, controlled voting brigades, etc., to happen on the sub. There are also some questionable mods that have been added recently here....</p>

<p>Browse rising at 3 am on a weekday and political posts disappear. This sub has been compromised for months now. It’s a honeypot, used to control and shape the opposition. </p>

<p>Exactly. It&#39;s sole purpose now is to simultaneously discredit the conspiracy community in general, and to manipulate public opinion to think that &quot;most&quot; people believe think this sub is crazy and filled with Russian and T_D bots and trolls. All they have to do is get one or two comments to the top saying how stupid the post is, or how the source has already been discredited, and a couple supporting replies, and they can easily hide the true public tone of any thread.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the main difference is that most actual r/conspiracy users who are simply here out of curiosity is that we approach all info in this sub and out of the sub with a healthy dose of skepticism. You see far fewer posts on the weekend that push a certain narrative with little to no proof. </p>

<p>The Biden posts are a good example. You see a post saying &quot;disgusting Biden groping little girls chest.&quot; In the comments most are saying this video on its own looks pretty harmless, but an army of opposition telling people they are projecting or protecting a pedo. I could see the same post being done on the weekend (although I doubt it would be) but it would be more like &quot;video of Biden where girl seems uncomfortable,&quot; with a more respectful discussion and then someone posting other videos that are much creepier. </p>

<p>On the weekend you&#39;d be able to float the idea that Biden is definitely over touchy but possibly not a pedofile and that maybe the loss of his one year old daughter and wife has affected him in some way without being down voted aggressively. Not saying that is true, just that people would consider the comment</p>
