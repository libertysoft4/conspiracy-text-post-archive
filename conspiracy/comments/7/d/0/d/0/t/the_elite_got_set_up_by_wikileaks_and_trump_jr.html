<p>The elite/media got set up. If Trump is playing 4D chess, there is no way they would do something as dumb as have Trump Jr. corresponding with Wikileaks on Twitter, as if they don&#39;t have a more private place to speak. </p>

<p>The entire conversation was pre-planned to get the public to indirectly look at Seth Rich. </p>

<p>Folks, when these mass arrests happen, forget about Uranium One, Hillary Clinton and John Podesta are going to be on a murder trial. Wikileaks will/has provided all the evidence. </p>

<p>None of us has a more private place to speak. The only questions are which combination of NSA/CSE/GCHQ/ASD/GCSB/BND/DGSE/GRU/MSS/ETC are creping on your data at any moment in time and what combination of technical/legal vulnerabilities they are exploiting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, he has somehow made his way into the oval office, and the mainstream media/establishment wants nothing more than to get him out of there. That&#39;s the most compelling evidence that he is at least on a <em>different</em> side than the TPTB. </p>

<p>Of course, his side might not necessarily be a good side either. But, unless this is a big soap opera (which is very possible), it seems that there is a real power shift happening in front of us right now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It does make sense to hide in plain sight. Look at how the Government has operated for decades. They encourage the &quot;Conspiracy&quot; mindset. It&#39;d easy to discredit someone when you call them a conspiracy theorist.
