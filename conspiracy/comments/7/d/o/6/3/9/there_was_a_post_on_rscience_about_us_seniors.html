    <div class="md"><p>There has been no piece of legislation that has done more to help seniors with their healthcare in US History than the Affordable Care Act. That + Medicare guarantees a medical safety net for our seniors.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the GOP who wants to gut medicare and leave seniors to fend for themselves when it comes to health costs. If given the chance the GOP would probably force them all to be euthanized just to line the pockets of the health insurance industry more. </p>

<p>Democrats and progressives are the only ones acutally fighting for senior health care. So why older people are more likely to vote GOP never makes sense to me at all. They are voting for their own deaths as GOP healthcare means their death will be expedited.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Private Insurance companies actually have incredible options for seniors on Medicare in the US. Plans that cost under $150 a month and cover ALL out of pocket expenses, even chemotherapy. These are called Medicare Supplements. As long as you sign up for these plans in your initial enrollment (most cases age 65) and pay your premiums every month you can never be denied coverage. But if you get sick later and try to enroll after your initial enrollment period, they will deny you coverage. The rates would become astronomical if sick people were allowed to join, have a procedure done, then leave without paying much money into the group.
Affordable Care Act aka Obamacare plans are awful due to the rules. They state that companies cannot deny coverage to sick people, so what incentive is there to get it when healthy?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They are not allowed to deny for pre-existing conditions was my understanding of that part. While some people are getting better deals others are getting the shaft big time. States aren&#39;t changing part time laws about health insurance because it got cheaper. Businesses can&#39;t afford to offer coverage to people anymore so they classify working 34  hours and under as part time. If they kept the same protections while enabling a more open market for competition I believe it would drive down the costs. But I&#39;m no expert. Thanks for your input.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would attribute the incident of seniors not being able to pay for their Medicare plans to more than just insurance is expensive. Irresponsible spending/saving is a big issue, unhealthy lifestyles, dependence on big Pharma, and people trying to cheat the system. Many insurance companies are “not for profit”, meaning they have to maintain within roughly 6% profit margins (BCBSNC), for example. The truth is the insurance companies HAVE to make a PROFIT or none of us will have insurance at all, and you do not want the government managing your care. I am not trying to shill, just educate. I find it interesting so many people here are against the gov (including myself), but are fine with bureaucrats making the final decisions about their health.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My 76 year old grandma still has to work as a school crossing guard to pay for her supplemental insurance that she has to carry so that things her Medicare/caid do not cover. It’s only like 3 hours a day but it’s out in the elements. This poor woman has worked her whole life, sometimes multiple jobs at a time to take care of her family and have the nice things that she has. It’s s shame that 16 years after she retired she is still working for something that she requires. She gets money from investments every month as well as 1100 a month from social security. That puts her on about a budget of 1600 a month. Considering that her insurance to cover her insurance is 333 a month that’s really not a ton of money left over.  Don’t get me wrong she doesn’t go with out and she lives a really good life. It’s just ridiculous that a strong powerful women like her has to still be strong and powerful even as her body gets weaker and and the challenges of getting older take their toll.   </p>
