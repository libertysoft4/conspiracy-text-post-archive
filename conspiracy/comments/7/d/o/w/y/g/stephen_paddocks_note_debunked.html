        <h3 class="title">Stephen Paddock's Note Debunked</h3>
        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">37</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2017-11-17 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/Zenyx_.html">Zenyx_</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So <a href="https://i.imgur.com/JwYJzCj.jpg">this</a> picture of Paddock&#39;s note is fake. We have a document with Paddock&#39;s writing on it, <a href="https://imgur.com/a/rnZIS">this</a> check. We can compare these two documents and to help everyone see what I&#39;m seeing I&#39;ve used colored circles to distinguish my points that debunk this note.  </p>

<p>Here is the <a href="https://imgur.com/a/hICGF">check</a> and the <a href="https://imgur.com/a/WfVJI">note</a>.</p>

<p>Red Circles:<br/>
In both pictures I&#39;ve highlighted the &quot;o&quot;s or &quot;0&quot;s found in the documents we have. In conjunction with the Green Circles make up the 0&#39;s and o&#39;s we see. The Red shows circles that begin at the left and come back around and finish on the left.  </p>

<p>Green Circles:<br/>
The green circles show upward and right starting o&#39;s and 0&#39;s, which is completely different. Notice how the check has mostly distinguishable left starting o&#39;s, and the note has mostly distinguishable <strong><em>right</em></strong> starting o&#39;s? This is our first clue and piece of evidence. These are not the same people&#39;s writings.  </p>

<p>Black Circles:<br/>
These circles show the number 4, and how it is written in both documents. See how the check has right slanted 4&#39;s and the note has left slanted?(and hard corners on the 4). Come to think of it, notice how <strong><em>everything</em></strong> in the note is more left slanted? Clue 2.  </p>

<p><strong><em>THE IMPORTANT ONE:</em></strong></p>

<p>Yellow Circles (excuse the top yellow one on the note):<br/>
Yellow circles show the  number 7, which is a glaring example and conclusive proof that the note is faked. The 7 Paddock writes does NOT have a strike through it, the note does. Also, the D Paddock writes begins at the top and is full at the bottom, the note is the opposite. Someone could correct me in saying that might be a triangle and not a D, but the 7 is still VERY conclusive.  </p>

<p>TL;DR: Title  </p>

<p>Edit: People have also said it might just be a photocopy, indicated by the badly printed line near the bottom and the dark tone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wouldn&#39;t say so definitively. Yes, they do appear to be much different handwriting styles, but on the note of the 7, sometimes I myself put a strike through it, and sometimes I don&#39;t. I also have variations in my 1&#39;s. Sometimes I write them with a hook hanging off the top and a line underneath, and sometimes I write just a straight line. Don&#39;t take the one single piece as full blown evidence. Question every single detail until you can undoubtedly prove the truth. Either way, like I already said, I do feel as though these are two very different handwriting styles, written by two different people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To be fair, the 7s I don&#39;t switch up near as often. About 80% of the time, I write it without a strike. My 1s, though, are about 50/50. It really just depends how I&#39;m feeling at that moment.</p>
