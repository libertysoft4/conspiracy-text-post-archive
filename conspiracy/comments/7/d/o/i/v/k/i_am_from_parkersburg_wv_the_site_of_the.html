        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><a href="https://imgur.com/ZQ0Cf56">Gif of Warehouse as it burned in Parkersburg, WV</a> </p>

<pre><code> The warehouse that caught fire was an abandoned building on Old Camden Avenue. It was an Ames tool warehouse before it was shut down and bought some time after by a man named Jeffrie D&#39;Costa. D&#39;Costa was a former supervisor for the Little Hocking DuPont facility. 

 In 2015 D&#39;Costa pled guilty to charges of &quot;fraud and swindling&quot;. Acts which he had committed between 2009-2012, as an employee for DuPont, resulted ultimately in the theft of $550,000 from his employer.

 D&#39;Costa had some sort of legal agreement with DuPont (lease/contract) that allowed the company to store chemicals, which they could not otherwise legally dispose of, in the warehouse. 

 D&#39;Costa did not maintain proper standards of storage for this facility with these chemicals       

 They regularly leaked out of their containers and were exposed to the elements, and each other. 

  On October 21, 2017 the old Ames warehouse caught fire, and the chemicals which were all stored there were burned and released into the air for approximately 5 or 6 days in total. An air quality warning was issued over the city. Over 6 surrounding local fire departments were called in to battle the flames. When local news sources attempted to get a statement from D&#39;Costa about the his storage methods and the cause of the fire, they were informed that D&#39;Costa had left the country for an undisclosed amount of time, to an undisclosed location. 

 Fast forward several weeks, and D&#39;Costa files an insurance claim seeking monetary compensation for the loss of the warehouse. 

 I cannot say for certain what actually happened. However, my theory is that D&#39;Costa burned down his own warehouse to get the insurance payout. I&#39;m not entirely sure of the nature of his relationship with DuPont, this could have been a way for D&#39;Costa to repent to his former employer for stealing from them. I.e. He gets rid of their chemicals for them since they can&#39;t OR he could be angry at them for catching him stealing, and hope to implicate them in this tragedy. Either way people need to know what DuPont does to the communities in which they operate. 

 When I was in elementary school there was a city wide blood test that people partook in. If an individuals blood had high enough concentrations of C8, DuPont would pay $400 to that individual as compensation for years of drinking tainted water. This fire is not the first major transgression that DuPont has engaged in, in my community. It is time for the public to educate themselves on the dealings of massive corporations, their employees, and the politicians they donate to. WAKE UP.

    <div class="md"><p>The revealing part is that D&#39;Costa is affiliated with IEI. online everything just says IEI owned the warehouses but you can&#39;t find anything out about IEI besides their CEO who isn&#39;t D&#39;Costa. Also, the fact that D&#39;Costa was out of the country after the fire, and draws attention to the fact that the fire might not have been a result of JUST negligence, but rather an arson aimed at claiming insurance payouts. </p>

<p>Maybe 15 years ago was driving back from a trip and got off at an exit around there at maybe 3am to look for food/gas. Took a wrong turn and suddenly some headlights turned on and started following us.

    <div class="md"><p>To answer your question, yes I do know the place. I have driven past it probably 4 times in the last month while I was Traveling to Beckley, WV. It is a massive piece of land that can only be seen in a few places from the road Bc the trees cover most of the actual reserve up from the interstate. That is actually where Trump went to address the BSA this year. Could be very well be of no coincidence that the president was at this place that may contain a secret bunker/base of some sort. The part of the state that it is located in (largely the center part of WV) has a very low population and a lot of mountains covered in woods. It would be very easy to hide something there off of any of the unmapped dirt roads. </p>
