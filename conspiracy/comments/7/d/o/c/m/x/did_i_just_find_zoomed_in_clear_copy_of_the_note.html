<p>Can anyone who has any experience with range calculations etc make any sense of that? </p>

<p>Can anyone confirm if this is a real photo or not?</p>

<p>Seems like he is trying to work out inital speed trajectory of bullets and then the speed after they hit target/richochet (collision)</p>

<p>If you compare that handwriting to the handwriting to the cheque for $14,000 for the car its very very similar.</p>

<p>Edit:  User Eluisys, has pointed out some problems with the equation, sorry folks im leaning towards this being fake :(
I had high hopes and as much as i want to believe it&#39;s real, Eluisys has pointed out some errors that i have no counter-argument for and his reasoning makes sense.</p>

<p>Everything should be similar in color (black) but when you have sharp edges like that in white, then it&#39;s usually a separate layer in the document, or has been manipulated in one way or another.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It looks like someone wrote out the info on white paper, then cut the white layer of the paper away in photoshop, feathered it a bit and pasted the dark text onto a digital scan of the brown.. If you zoom in on the txt you can see the left over bright white pixels here or there in the writing. It&#39;s also why I suspect the lower straight line looks kind of like a pen running out of ink, being they had to hit feather a few times clear out the white back ground. </p>

<p>I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s fake, but that&#39;s still just a guess. It&#39;s also possible that due to how the picture was taken etc that&#39;s why it looks that way. Yet go take and write out a bunch of notes right now and take a picture of them, none of them will look like that one does. Being the txt is clearly too digital. </p>

<p>It&#39;s also very possible all of that was done deliberately to mask how the info was leaked out. Yet if we were taking bets, I&#39;m going with fake. </p>
