That is the main reason why governments have been slow to legalize it. There are too many bought off politicians. </p>

<p>A 2014 study <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/1898878">showed</a> a significant decrease in deaths from opiates where marijuana was made legal. Marijuana puts a direct hit in the profits from pharmaceutical companies. </p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2017/investigations/dea-drug-industry-congress/?utm_term=.42d91d09e9ea">pharmaceutical lobbies have also opposed DEA enforcement in the US against corrupt doctors and pharmaceutical companies.</a> What we basically have is &quot;legalized heroin&quot; in the US, and slow legalization of marijuana. It&#39;s a completely backwards system. </p>

<li><p>In 2009, Dr. Marcia Angell of the New England Journal of Medicine wrote: <a href="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2009/jan/15/drug-companies-doctorsa-story-of-corruption/">“It is simply no longer possible to believe much of the clinical research that is published, or to rely on the judgment of trusted physicians or authoritative medical guidelines. I take no pleasure in this conclusion, which I reached slowly and reluctantly over my two decades as an editor of The New England Journal of Medicine.”</a></p></li>
<li><p>Richard Horton, editor in chief of The Lancet, recently wrote: <a href="http://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/lancet/PIIS0140-6736%2815%2960696-1.pdf">“Much of the scientific literature, perhaps half, may simply be untrue. Afflicted by studies with small sample sizes, tiny effects, invalid exploratory analyses, and flagrant conflicts of interest, together with an obsession for pursuing fashionable trends of dubious importance, science has taken a turn towards darkness. As one participant put it, “poor methods get results”.</a></p></li>
<li><p>&quot;I can&#39;t tell you exactly what percentage of the trials are flawed, but I think the problem is far bigger than you imagine, and getting worse...it is so easy to manipulate data, conceal it or fabricate it...there is almost a code of silence not to speak about it.&quot; -<a href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/zeitgeist/spiegel-interview-with-whistleblower-doctor-peter-wilmshurst-a-1052159.html">Whistleblower Dr. Peter Wilmshurst</a></p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>The thing that pisses me off is the fact that we have all the proof of obvious corruption in the system, but we still can hardly do anything about it because we as a people can&#39;t seem to unite on anything. And THAT is what the government depends on. Our confusion.</p>

<p>They just keep stirring the pot with their BS war on drugs (which is designed to take away the rights of millions of poor people once they are labeled as a &#39;criminal&#39;), adding fuel to the racial fires by imposing laws and allowing police actions based on race, while making them seem &quot;racially neutral&quot;, constantly changing laws so they can&#39;t be challenged in courts, and allowing us to &quot;think&quot; we have a voice by voting, but greatly restricting the allowable actions of the people we vote in, until they &quot;play ball.&quot;</p>

<p>Complete reformation is needed from the bottom up. From the individual, to the family, to the community, then local government, and so on.  IT WILL NOT CHANGE from top to bottom. There is too much money at the top, so we as a people have to come together and put our differences aside in order to make those changes we need in our country and cut off their financial supply.</p>

<p>That is the only way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I might tend to agree to the point that its not harmful to most with moderate usage. Too much smoke in anybody&#39;s lung can be drying and lead to problems, but that is easily mitigated with marijuana. </p>

<p>For people with addictive personalities though things can get tricky. But there will always be something to be addicted to for people like that. If I didn&#39;t live in a place that was very tolerant of weed when I was younger I have no doubt I would have been an alcoholic at best and a full blown junkie at worst.</p>

<p>Yeah I agree, but there are still numerous consumption methods that don&#39;t involve inhaling smoke, especially for medicinal use.</p>

<p>To much of my surprise however, studies have actually shown that smoking marijuana is perhaps beneficial to respiratory/lungs:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>recent large studies have shown that, instead of reducing forced expiratory volume in 1 s and forced vital capacity (FVC), marijuana smoking is associated with increased FVC. The cause of this is unclear, but acute bronchodilator and anti-inflammatory effects of cannabis may be relevant</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In a large cross-section of U.S. adults, cumulative lifetime marijuana use, up to 20 joint-years, is not associated with adverse changes in spirometric measures of lung health.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25521349">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25521349</a></p>

<p>Also consider the fact that the all time greatest Olympian and swimmer, Michael Phelps, was a habitual pot smoker. </p>

<p>Sure, someone consuming alcohol with zero awareness of the strength of drink and/or their own limit is putting themselves at risk of dying.</p>

<p>If someone were to continue to smoke some weed to the extreme limit (why would someone do that in the first place), the very worst case scenario is they fall asleep.</p>

<p>Weed shouldn&#39;t be compared to alcohol, imo. It&#39;s far less toxic than an Aspirin.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with what you are saying, but labeling strength won&#39;t do much for the average person.</p>

<p>Most drinkers don&#39;t know what proof is or how it relates to how drunk they get. They just drink until they get the feeling thay they don&#39;t need to drink anymore.  Usually by finding out how much is too much, and working their dosage down...</p>

<p>Think about all people that refuse a tequila shot (120proof) saying tequila gets them too drunk, so they opt for a vodka shot (120proof) instead. </p>

<p>Marijuana has an added benefit of a rapid onset allowing people to work their dosage up, and it is very easy for responsible people to self-dose appropriately.</p>

I do believe, for the most part, with the idea one gets the high we need not want.

    <div class="md"><p>I’m 100% for legalization and I think cannabis is a wonderful medicine that can help a lot of people, and I think it can be fun and uplifting when not abused. However, I do think there are <em>a lot</em> of people who abuse cannabis and are in denial about it. Excessive daily smoking makes many people lazy and demotivated, and while it may not be a physical addiction, it can be addictive in a certain way. And no, a cannabis addiction isn’t going to lead to you being dead in the gutter, but it certainly can lead to you being couchbound and shutting your brain off and smoking your life away. People want to say there is nothing harmful about cannabis, but I just don’t think that’s true. It can definitely be harmful. I think people need to be willing to admit the potential for abuse and have a conversation about sensible use that respects the gifts the plant has to offer.</p>

<p>I know I personally have spent too much time couchbound and smoking my life away. I have quit entirely now and I also know how easy it would be to start again and get back to old habits. I can’t be around it because I know I have no self control.</p>

I talk with my coworkers about different drugs and their effects. Most of us agree on the harms of opioids and the literal ignorance of executives to Marijuana. We are up there on the ladder as well so we aren&#39;t voiceless. I see contracts for Marijuana derived drugs come across my desk. Most are no problem. My personal opinion is that organizations known in my field as GPOs (group purchasing organizations) are the main entities to blame for lack of adaptation. This is my educated point of view. They aren&#39;t evil either but the amount of money that flows through these systems is astronomical. As an example I have a current discrepancy on my desk. 2 customers spent 29,000 in one month on a product they may not be eligible for. It&#39;s not a big deal I just have to find out why and how they have access. It&#39;s not a conspiracy, these people are legally allowed their purchasez, it&#39;s just the price at question. Since that&#39;s 2 customers. There is a GPO with 39,000 offices connected to the same contract. To give more of an idea my responsibilities include several million dollars. No my salary does not scale with this.</p>

<p>I&#39;m open to questions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My company personally doesn&#39;t make anything. We are a large distributor. The companies that make and hold these patents probably are unscrupulous. I don&#39;t doubt that they have scientific studies and many brilliant and kind people working for them though. My experience with patents and such do lead me to the standard phrase of literal controls on substance. Growing your own anything is a noble and forward thinking about ecologically sustainable life. The only thing I would warn against is dosing. That&#39;s where these companies that may not be evil come in. Their facilities and distributors provide a lab safe and accurate dosage of any of these Marijuana derived substances. Much like an edible if someone ate something that was 8x the dosage they intended it obviously wouldnt have the desired effect. While that wouldn&#39;t be life threatening it may be a certain turn off to a totally effective treatment. </p>

<p>Studies do, however, incontrovertibly prove marijuana can <strong>permanently</strong> lower IQ through heavy use. It can antagonize latent psychological disorders in people who might otherwise never have experienced said disorders. It has been shown to cause memory problems. And, perhaps most importantly, it frequently turns people who use it regularly into low-life degenerates with low ambition. Clearly there are exceptions.  </p>

<p>With that said, I do believe it should be legalized and further researched so we can have definitive data proving its medicinal effectiveness.</p>

<p>Marijuana should be legal for the fact it&#39;s a relatively safe recreational substance which meets all reasonable thresholds for legality alcohol does and more.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Marijuana is more than reasonably safe, but this isn&#39;t the primary reason it should be legalized.  The primary reason it should be legalized is that criminalization doesn&#39;t work and has many large-scale negative consequences.  The fact that widespread use over the last 50-60 years has generally indicated its not a toxic or dangerous substance is just icing on the cake.</p>

<p>I think people who make broad medical arguments about marijuana are mostly well-intentioned, but it&#39;s the wrong argument to make.  I don&#39;t think that many arguments are based on strong science (prohibition simply hasn&#39;t allowed much science to take place) and there&#39;s a reasonable suspicion that &quot;medical&quot; is just a way to skirt prohibition for recreational use.  Worst case, the medical arguments sound like new age, hippy-dippy nonsense.</p>

<p>I do think there will probably be scientifically validated and well understood medical therapies that come from marijuana, but it will take years after full-scale legalization to really discover them because the institutions that can do the work are legally sensitive about running afoul of Federal law.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Depends on what the claim is. If you&#39;re claiming that pharmaceutical companies will sometimes lie, or manipulate the results of studies, or bribe lawmakers, or neglect to report harmful effects that would get their drugs pulled -- that&#39;s a commonly understood fact.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re claiming that &quot;big pharma&quot; is deliberately suppressing the knowledge that marijuana cures cancer so they can continue raking in the billions by keeping people sick and selling them chemo drugs -- that&#39;s a conspiracy theory.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Conspiracy means &quot;2 or more people <em>conspiring</em> to commit a crime&quot;.</p>

<p>Not &quot;crazy idea that isn&#39;t true&quot;. You&#39;ve been led to believe that is the definition by the CIA who used the term &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot; to label people who questioned the JFK assassination they were most likely responsible for.</p>

<p>It&#39;s incredible the number of people who think it is the second definition. It is literally a part of how <em>they</em> continue to keep the public in the dark and <em>the</em> conspiracy keeps going on.</p>
