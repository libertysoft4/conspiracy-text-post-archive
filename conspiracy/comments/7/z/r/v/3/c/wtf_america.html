    <div class="md"><p>Not at all. A teacher trapped in a school building doesn&#39;t have any choice but to engage the shooter (or hide) if they are to survive. It doesn&#39;t require courage or &quot;goodness&quot; – only a will to live. Even if they don&#39;t care about the kids at all, they&#39;d still want to save their own ass.</p>

<p>Members of law enforcement storming in from the outside is a totally different story. That&#39;s opt-in, so to speak.</p>

<p>This concept is explored in literally thousands of films and books, FYI.</p>
