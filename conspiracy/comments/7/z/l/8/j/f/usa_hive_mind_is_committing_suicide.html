<p>That&#39;s the problem, you&#39;re on the outside.</p>

<p>As an insider, there is a war going on, and lots of people are waking the fuck up, questioning everything, no longer buying into the bullshit, no longer watching CNN, no longer buying into the debt/wage/slave system like the older generations.</p>

<p>Because so many are waking up, its causing growing pains.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you. OP is an outsider. We are fighting for our lives. The outsiders are already dead so far as I&#39;m concerned. Dead. Men. Walking. </p>

<p>I&#39;m a migrant to this country, brought here by my parents. When we became citizens I took an oath. And the older I become the more I realize that the original tenants, despite the modern perversions, are ultimately true as far as life on THIS realm is concerned. </p>

<p>Anyone taking advice from the French or British or Belgians in regards to ANYTHING related to preserving ones culture or way of life needs to seriously reconsider what they believe. </p>

<p>The entire world relies on our armed forces yet decries this nation for being too gung ho. And when we say we&#39;ll leave the Paris accord or NATO or whatever else agreement, they lambast us for absconding. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve had enough. I swore an allegiance to THIS nation, not the one that my family realized forsook us, not the ones that seek to keep the USA under their pathetic guilt trip. </p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry. But at this point - take care of your own, stand your ground, and may God be with you. But fuck the fuck off, giving us advice related to what you&#39;ve done AS A NATION - wherever you are OP - your nation is doomed to cuckoldry and doom, with no chance of survival. </p>

<p>You&#39;re welcome to try and change my mind but I assume you&#39;re from Europe or perhaps South America in which case yeah....I don&#39;t think you have ANYTHING developed in the last 350 years that we need  - as far as technology, philosophy, or way of life are concerned. </p>

<p>Dude, Im here. People who thought I was crazy because all my water is reverse osmosis filtered, I dont eat meat, and the I stayed away from MSM news and cord cutter, are all now saying I was right all along and they are following suit.</p>

<p>I go to the grocery store, and literally see people reading the labels and putting items back saying things like, &quot;no this one has benzoate in it, or this one has high fructose corn syrup&quot;.</p>

<p>I have nephews that are 12-13 asking me if I saw loose change or heard what alex jones said, and so on. Its a massive awakening going on against the system</p>

<p>sure poverty has always been here, and yes that too is increasing, as the rich get richer. All pat of &quot;their&quot; plan</p>

<p>The idiocracy is global. I went and visited Japan, China, Europe, and India when I took a year off. In each of those areas, there are certain % of populace who is educated from University, but they actually have ZERO critical thinking skills</p>

<p>I&#39;m an ex-democrat (life long and left 2 years ago) and I have warmed up to him. I think the &quot;him being an idiot narrative&quot; is just the MSM play, and I have been on both ends of the debate with this topic. However, my conclusion is that even if he was what you propose, to me its the Joker card in the Tarot, and bug Fuck You to the whole Political system which I think is completely necessary.</p>

<p>Regardless, your take on Trump represents the MSM fake narrative to outsiders, and yet here we are, half the country voted for him, many were also independents and democrats</p>

<p>Guns are illegal in Mexico, and they have massive amount of murders.</p>

<p>The problem here is mental psychological, cultural, economic, etc. Its not as simple as to blame guns. Those same &quot;Guns&quot; freed us from being U.K.&#39;s bitch. Those same &quot;guns&quot; were used in the Civil war where tons of Americans died for the rights of minorities.</p>

<p>In both cases, without guns, we could have still been England Part 2 where slavery is still legal or was still legal up until maybe a handful of decades ago.</p>

<p>My take on it: I think the idiocracy is global, people in general are just stupid as fuck, and we need to be focused on a set of evolutionary based principals, including genetically modifying humans, so we start to get more intelligent, more aware, more balanced in nature.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump is the king in the pack. This hackneyed idea of him being some sort of maverick is so clearly off the mark I&#39;m amazed people are still parroting it. He is the 1%, and he is apparently committed to furthering the divide.  </p>

<p>Regarding guns, t&#39;s not just a problem of access, I realise. The outdated frontier mentality is still encouraged and very much a part of the American psyche. (I would also suggest that they did more to facilitate slavery in the first place than abolish it, by the way.)</p>

<p>But just in terms of practicality, there is just such an insane amount of guns in your country now. Where can they go? You are stuck with them forever, even if you do manage to evolve beyond your fetishisation for them.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m actually numb to the school shooting and it really didnt effect me much, because I grew up in Chicago, where on the South Side, the black kids/gangs shoot and kill each other every weekend, with an average of 30+ murders a month. This is in a city where gins have been illegal and so on.</p>

<p>I have also been to Japan, where there are no guns and no one is armed, besides police units.</p>

<p>A large portion of this is culture. Japan is predominately Japanese with a completely different cultural values to the U.S. and so, they don&#39;t need guns there. At the same time, it would be very easy for some tyrannical style dictator (Duterte Style?) to start taking over the people and no one would do anything.</p>

<p>I&#39;m guessing it would be the same for your country as well?</p>

<p>Also stuff like this:</p>

<p><a href="https://news.stanford.edu/2014/07/16/voices-culture-luhrmann-071614/">https://news.stanford.edu/2014/07/16/voices-culture-luhrmann-071614/</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Stanford anthropologist Tanya Luhrmann found that voice-hearing experiences of people with serious psychotic disorders are shaped by local culture – in the United States, the voices are harsh and threatening; in Africa and India, they are more benign and playful. This may have clinical implications for how to treat people with schizophrenia, she suggests.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Anyway, its REALLY complex. I am also of the school of the collective consciousness, i.e your posts &quot;Hive Mind&quot; concept. You have to understand, the soil here is drenched with the blood and memories of the civil war, where the country was split because of slavery and fought and died for a resolution. </p>

<p>This all after fighting a revolution, and prior to that, stealing land from the Natives and the Mexicans.</p>

<p>All of this Pent up Death, division, war, revolutions, wild wild west, is all still here in the Hive Mind, however it has been for the most part, put in check by the rules and laws of checks and balances via the constitution. Having guns is one of those reasons. When everyone has guns, no one is willing to try a take over. </p>

<p>Of course this lets the crazies shoot up schools and what not. </p>

<p>Anyway, I think the biggest joke is that everyone is globally making a big deal about the school shooting, but twice to 3 times that amount of teens and young adults get killed each month in gang shootouts in the South Side of Chicago for decades and no one says or does anything.</p>

<p>But then again, there was a genocide in Africa in the mid 90&#39;s and no one ever told me about it, nothing in school, no memorials, tv specials, nothing. I only found out about it when studying the history of Genocides in general, jewish and armenian</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We are very much aware that the problem is much bigger than the school massacres.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s definitely not in the Australian psyche to think there is or may be the need to arm ourselves against the government. That is a mentality that seems bizarre to me as a member of a functioning democracy - but, as you say, the history of America is long, violent and unstable and that has definitely made its mark. I agree it is a complex issue - but I think the idea of everyone having a gun is objectively insane. And it&#39;s a moot point anyway because those millions of guns aren&#39;t going anywhere. You&#39;ve doomed yourselves and your guns will outlast your country. It&#39;s interesting that your responses have neglected to address the issue of gun saturation.</p>

<p>Sure there is gun saturation, but not &quot;everyone has a gun&quot; as you suggest. There are rules, laws, checks and balances that shift and change according to the times, politicians, states, and so on.</p>

<p>Regardless, even if guns were banned and not as saturated, I still think there would be school shootings here due to the black market, importation, the ability to DIY builds, and or the use of other items like using a vehicle or truck to run over students. (what are we gonna do, ban all cars?)</p>

<p>You guys are hardly safe. Regardless of how you explain away the above links, the bottom line is there are people there, banks, money, and resources. Which means, someone, somewhere already has eyes and plans for you guys, and there are already certain folks within your country, controlling your banks, your government, and the future of your own collapse.

<p>Its not a fair call. Xenophobia lately, is being used by SJW&#39;s as a tactic to label someone unfairly, if they are discussing something that is deemed offensive to the labeler, in this case you.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Well the Asian invasion in the form of Owning U.S. Debt, Buying out Hollywood Studios, and demanding permission of how Chinese are viewed in any Hollywood movies, certainly proves that it&#39;s happening at the corporate level. I haven&#39;t even done that much research, but I guarantee you there are aspects of AUS that are bought out and owned by the Chinese.</p>

<p>By the way, I criticize everything: Islam, Christianity, my own country (The U.S.), race, Israel, Russia, U.K. and so on. I have the right to criticize these things, and that doesn&#39;t make me Xenophobic. Have you guys in AUS also been on the SJW safe space special snowflake kick as well?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>And, there it is. Of course!!!! LOL</p>

<blockquote>

<p>DING DING DING, we have another winner!!!</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Of course not, you guys will just get slowly bought out, owned, and priced out of sections of your own country, and forced to move elsewhere like is happening in S.A. </p>

<p>At the very least, the U.S. is Half Nationalist, so we are aware and conscious of making change to prevent these things or bring them to light to change them.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Your gun situation is absurd and fucking terrifying.</p>

<p>No its not. I have foreign family members (Poland) and friends from Norway, Japan, and other countries have visited and stayed with me and enjoyed their time here. 2 of them are working on getting a Visa to come here and work/live here permanently. One of my cousins and his Japanese wife and daughter, have already gotten their visa, liver here permanently, and love it here.</p>

<p>Your Australian Media I&#39;m guessing is owned by the same Propaganda Leftist outlets as here, so they lie to you, and you eat it up dont you, lol</p>

<blockquote>

<p>You guys have not enough guns, and all it takes is 1 tyrant or a communist coming into power in your country, to really show you people how bad and how many deaths of citizens can come from the control of your country by 1 man. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s b/c we&#39;re a Christian nation. It&#39;s in the end of the book... Global war, poverty, disease... All signs that the end is nigh. It&#39;s a <em>good</em> thing remember. It means their messaiah is about to make their heaven on Earth. </p>

<p>There&#39;s these guys who adamantly believe that the end game goal is for there to be a great war to end all wars. We all die in horrendous ways. This is the goal. These are the men that we put in charge of our foreign relations, and give control of our military, and the keys of our nukes to. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s put the guys who want to see the ship go down in a blaze of glory in control of the ship. That&#39;s a wonderful idea, what could possibly go wrong. We&#39;ve been it for a good one to two hundred years, but somehow we&#39;re still here, and floating on¯\_(ツ)_/¯</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That comes off like I hate Christianity, but good people don&#39;t seize power. The good Christians are being good Christians, while the devil owned Christians are making money off of war in a false God they have built to justify their imperialism. It&#39;s a slippery slope condemning religion. It varies so much from person to person.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nationalism is kind of fucking tiresome.</p>

<p>You know there are Americans creating loving homes and a hopeful future everyday.</p>

<p>Unfortunately these people exist in spite of the oligarchy at the top of the long-infiltrated. corruption soaked government. </p>

<p>American &quot;freedom&quot; was not guarded with vigilance.</p>

<p>Information was compartmentalized over time.</p>

<p>Alien interests were allowed incremental beachheads in the halls of the American power.</p>

<p>Education was weaponized against the majority of people.</p>

<p>Having learned from the mistakes of the past Empires,
programs were begun by deep planners against the people. </p>

<p>The USA was never intended to be the cliche sold to its consumers.</p>

<p>The greatest threat to the American oligarchy is the American people.  </p>
