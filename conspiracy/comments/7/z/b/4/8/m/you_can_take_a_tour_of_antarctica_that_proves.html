    <div class="md"><p>So these tours that are available are fronts by some nefarious cartel that takes people to a pantomime or watered down idea of Antarctica?</p>

<p>Japanese marine biology students circumnavigated it, a host of extreme sportsters and adventurers types have gone... That all in some secret elusive club? Once they see around the veil they get some decoder ring and an ice key to the ice door in the ice wall?</p>

<p>Mean temperature -fucking20°c nothing but ice and rock... No one wants to go ffs. Those who can afford it and have the desire do.</p>

<p>Most of Antarctic being preserved is not a sign of some nefarious plot. It is to keep the last unfucked part of the world unfucked. </p>

<p>Ever been to a state or federal park?</p>

<p>Fat idiots leaving piles of shit everywhere. 
Yeah they should run cruises and hand out sleds to all comers. 2  Fer Tuesdays.</p>

<p>Not much of a conspiracy. Thousands of scientists have been there. What do you think they are studying?</p>

<p>Think they are in a club now? Think they are harbouring the gateway to the inner earth... Hanging with Bird and Hitler?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just labelling anything as a conspiracy doesn&#39;t make it safe from criticism. Seems like another silly stance you are taking. </p>

<p>If anything you should welcome having your feet put to the fire. It will let you flesh out your hypothesis. Although it should be done before its presented. </p>

<p>The treaty of the Antarctic was done before it was even really explored. How did they know where to put the safe zone?</p>

<p>Maybe part of Atlantis is showing where we are allowed. Got $10 k for a week? Half spent travelling? Seems like the shitest of shit holidays. </p>
