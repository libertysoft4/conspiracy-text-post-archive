<p>Or that those structures were there before these civilizations actually rose. Like Sacsayhuaman, which was apparently attributed to the Killke people, not the Inca the Spanish found inhabiting it. But why is what is arguably the most massive and stunning piece of megalithic architecture in south America the only one attributed to a comparetively unknown group of people?</p>

<p>King Tut had boomerangs and there are groups of South American natives with more DNA in common with polynesians and Australian Aborigines than North American Natives. History&#39;s fucking weird. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe that many of the megalithic ruins that inhabit our planet are much older than antiquity would have us believe. Unfortunately we will never truly know much of the truth of what really existed as far as knowledge and civilization before major global religions, mostly Abrahamic, actively sought to suppress the knowledge of the ancients. Those savages that wouldn&#39;t accept the given deity were destroyed as well as their stories. Even shamans world wide have been polluted in one way or another by one of the Abrahamic falsities.  South America,  Poly-Micro-Mela-nesia, Africa, the Americas. It&#39;s all been pillaged and looted of it&#39;s memories to help support myths. If some of the things we are learning are true about calamity hitting the planet every 13,000 years or so you never know what form of humanity has managed to take hold and what they were able to do. And to what scale that calamity was able to destroy whatever forms of life were dominate and what paths they chose to go with their culture and technology. We are taught so intrinsically that we are the best that this world has ever produced and that we must nurture our egos. It&#39;s all be design and the people that run the show probably know more about what <em>was</em> then we ever will. To know what the Smithsonian and Vatican have in their vaults would be pretty great I&#39;d think. </p>
