        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The title says it all, really. </p>

<p>Many &#39;anonymous sources&#39; proved to have truth, hence all the scandals that have hit the white house. One example, the top post on <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> is &quot;Trump revealed highly classified information to Russian foreign minister and ambassador&quot; and that was according to &quot;according to current and former U.S. officials&quot;. And of course, this was soon confirmed. </p>

<p>This is just one example, but there&#39;s many. A lot of people, from individuals here to t_d to regular folks on the right who back Trump, just dismiss anonymous sources as fake news, ignoring that journalists in big news organizations have to do many things to prove the validity of the claims before they are published, which is ironic since many of the MAGA sites such as truepundit or conservative tree house function more as blogs without all of those traditional checks that journalists at the NYTimes have to do.</p>

<p>If you look at the number of times that the anti-Trump media has actually retracted a story, it&#39;s far and few in between. That isn&#39;t to say that it&#39;s coverage of Trump is perfect, but that it tries to actually report on facts. However, this isn&#39;t what I want to ask.</p>

<p>What I do want to ask is why do the same people that see &#39;anonymous sources&#39; in the media as proof of fake news but put so much trust in Q?</p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen things that prove him/them to be in a high up position, but that&#39;s about it. Just because he was on AF1 doesn&#39;t mean he&#39;s a top military brass that knows about any top secret government plans. Seems more to me that he&#39;s posting cryptic stuff that occasionally hits when hindsight is apparent. For example, the latest &quot;5) I hear you&quot; with 5 fingers looks completely coincidental. Maybe if it were from an official photo instead of a talk with students where somebody took the picture at the right time I would believe it, but in the end I&#39;m just not buying it.</p>

<p>So, Qanon followers, please redpill me on qanon. Tell me why you believe an anonymous source on an image board known for trolling and jokes while you don&#39;t believe the mainstream media that is held accountable by (if nothing else) the marketplace of ideas.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is insane. I can&#39;t believe this nonsense is getting upvoted. The manipulative strategy employed by MSM and parroted on <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> and across much of Reddit involves a constant barrage of misleading headlines intentionally designed to twist a kernel of truth into a scandal.  </p>

<p>The statements you were responding to made it very clear that the administration was meticulously careful and responsible about the release of classified information to the Russians in the sense that they only shared what was necessary for Russian intelligence to be aware of a specific threat which both nations face. This is obviously the right thing to do, because we all know what kind of chaos can occur following a large terrorist attack. Strategically, it is essential to help the Russians avoid their own 9/11 style attack because of the potential that this attack is intended to destabilize global security and trigger a global conflict.  </p>

<p>The lie was that he did something wrong. They rightfully denied that and were proven right and now you are continuing to try to twist this into a scandal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just used that as an example because it was on the top and was the easiest thing to write about. I could have picked a better one, but for the sake of getting that example out of the way, I didn&#39;t. </p>

<p>But, to answer your point, yes, helping stop a terrorist attack is important The issue is much greater then that, though. </p>

<p>That intel was not found by us. It did not directly belong to us. Trump giving that intel out risks that intel source being compromised, and that risks other nations giving the US intel in the future. The same with the Nunes memo, if top secret info can be easily revealed when it&#39;s politically convenient, why would an ally give us secrets knowing that the US can&#39;t be trusted with it?
That&#39;s why the intelligence community within the US was upset about his actions. It risks compromising our alliances.</p>

<p>Also, way to hype up the attack</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The plot was to hide a bomb on a laptop. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metrojet_Flight_9268#Crash">They did the same before</a> and it did not cause anything near what you&#39;re talking about. Yes, terrorist attacks are bad. But you pretending his actions are so pure is wrong.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s like you have no concept of what false flag attacks are about. You are worried about damaging our relationship with Israeli intelligence without even realizing the possibility that this was an intentional move against the Israelis to stop them from conducting a false flag attack. People in this forum have become such shallow thinkers. &quot;Trump is bad because I was told that he could have jeopardized information sharing with Israel!&quot; To be honest it&#39;s incredibly irresponsible to publicize and speculate about this meeting and what intel was shared. This is literally a matter of national security. Do we know why Trump decided to share that information or even what information was <em>actually</em> shared? Trump may appear to cooperate with Israel, but their Mossad is a formidable foe to tangle with. The MSM has people so convinced that Trump couldn&#39;t plan his way out of a paper bag that people don&#39;t even realize that we are all talking out of our asses and he has access to so much more information than us. We know that he does not reveal his strategy, because that would be stupid. We don&#39;t know the intent of that sharing, and this could very easily have been a move to prevent a false flag attack by the very same group who fed him the information in the first place.</p>

<p>Like, what the fuck would this even mean in this case? Israel wants to plan an attack against Russia, so it does it, but then it goes around telling the US about it?

<p>So I apologize about that. But the reason I&#39;m being hostile is because that story you&#39;re saying is based off so many hypotheticals and poor interpretations off how politics works.

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for clarifying, I&#39;m genuinely here for honest conversation so if that was just a slip up then let&#39;s move on.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think everything is a false flag, absolutely not, but in this particular case there is both a means and motive that ties in to a general conspiracy theory alleging a secret plan to eventually bait the US and Russia into what would become WWIII. There is obviously no shortage of theories alleging Mossad foul play behind 9/11 and bad intel related to the wars that followed. It seems obvious that we should be aware that our own IC would be recipients and targets of fabricated intelligence to manipulate the global mainstream consensus. My point wasn&#39;t so much to advocate that particular theory, although I don&#39;t find it to be implausible. My point was more a criticism of mainstream media creating a spectacle about choices made by the President regarding sharing of classified information. This could be damaging to national security precisely because the media presumably would not be privy to any underlying motivation for the sharing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah no you are 100% delusional. Trump couldn&#39;t keep his mouth shut and spilled the exact city where the intelligence was gathered from, which compromises our relationship with Israel (who gathered the initial intel) and all othee countries who share intel with us. It also put that source in jeapordy, and possibly destroyed an existing method of recon if still deployed. All because your dunce of a president doesnt understand that details matter, and that words have a fundamental impact even though he treats them like garbage. </p>

<p>About a month after the vegas shooting, q came out and told everyone that the shooting was a false flag attempt to assassinate the prince of Saudi Arabia, who is now king.

<p>Except:</p>

<p>1.) Most of his claims are <em>not</em> accurate, i.e. &quot;Huma and Podesta will be indicted in early November&quot;</p>

<p>2.) People follow Q because he &quot;confirms&quot; what they <em>want</em> to believe. Plenty of leaders (and bullshit artists) have followings thanks to claims that are utterly devoid of fact or merit.</p>

<p>Now, to clarify here: &quot;I find Q entertaining&quot; and &quot;He gives us some interesting rabbitholes to go down&quot; are <em>way</em> different sentiments from &quot;I believe Q is making accurate claims, and is the real deal.&quot;</p>

<p>The first two sentiments are fine, but the latter is what OP (and I, and many others) are criticizing. There are people (not necessarily you, I don&#39;t know you) who accept his wild, unsubstantiated claims as absolute fact, and that is deeply troubling (and no better than liberals who accept anonymous sources making undocumented claims about Trump in MSM pieces).</p>

<p>Also, I&#39;m not trying to &quot;disprove&quot; anything; I&#39;m saying that Q Anon (and his loyal gang of researchers) <em>hasn&#39;t proved anything</em>. The burden of proof lies with the party making the accusation; Q has provided none, yet his followers lap up his every pronouncement like eager dogs. </p>

<p>OP&#39;s problem (and mine) is that his followers argue (correctly) that anonymous sources who do not prove/verify their claims are &quot;fake news&quot; (especially when said claims reflect poorly on Trump), yet these same people uncritically and unquestioningly accept allegations from Q, who provides zero evidence for his claims.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Q dropped very little &quot;intel&quot;; he made a series of inferences and riddles referring to a <em>wide</em> swath of important geopolitical issues and entities, all of which could reasonably be in the news at any given time. The little bits of &quot;intel&quot; he <em>did</em> drop (i.e. Huma and Podesta) never happened.</p>

<p>Again, my point is this: If you enjoy the areas of discussion Q raises, great. But an anonymous person making claims without providing any documentary evidence should be views <em>extremely</em> skeptically, the same way you guys view &quot;anonymous government sources&quot; cited in MSM pieces skeptically.</p>

<p>The thing with Q is that anybody can post shit and say they’re Q, but once you weed that crap out there’s a lot of solid rabbit holes to go down. Q was how I got into conspiracies do I’m not as well versed as you all but during the “draining the swamp” phase Q would post about officials being fired and reasons why that were time stamped before most MSM had reported it. He straight up called there would be an attack directly at Rothschild and the next day 2 planes “collided” in midair above their mansion. He called Clinton and Haiti. </p>

<p>But the most important thing for me is that he called for NSA surveillance of Twitter. A week later net neutrality passed and another week later I log into Twitter and my account was froze until I verify email due to shady activity (that’s how i found Q compilations). That was the day Julian Assantes deleted his twitter account. </p>

<p>Q posts suck now but I highly recommend reading the PDF compilation Book_of_q.pdf if you can find it. </p>

<p>If someone makes an allegation, they need to have documentary evidence before I believe it to be true.

<p>Yes, which is why it&#39;s important not to accept unsubstantiated, anonymous claims as fact. We can investigate anonymous claims, and keep them in our minds as worth considering; but we cannot consider them <em>fact</em> until we have been provided proof.</p>

<p>I&#39;m fine with this. The problem isn&#39;t people who say &quot;Q is probably a LARP, but he&#39;s entertaining and provides us with fun rabbitholes to investigate.&quot; The problem is with people who accept his claims as absolute fact, when we don&#39;t even know if he is who he claims to be.</p>

<p>Yes, it&#39;s conceivable. But there&#39;s no objective proof of this aside from Q&#39;s claims.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>False claims can be used strategically to smoke people out of hiding or trick them into making mistakes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is true but I don&#39;t think those claims would come in the form of 4chan posts. That&#39;s using the wrong medium to message anybody with power.</p>

<p>Maybe. But I doubt it. Like I said, his narrative is flawed but it&#39;s more entertaining than what&#39;s on TV.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, the cryptographic anonymity of 4chan is a convenient benefit in a military intelligence campaign than involves seeding information to the public. The absurdity of using that particular channel of communication also plays into the obfuscation tactic of keeping your enemy guessing because they would know this strategy well and know that it could be real, but the uncertainty weakens and delays their ability to respond.</p>

<p>If this is the case, yes it is a good way of doing it.</p>

<p>If the &#39;enemies&#39; are watching then they can probably determine what the messages are better then the autists at pol because they also have top secret information. If they can&#39;t, the autists at pol will tell them what it means. So Q is effectively telling the enemy the plan. Doesn&#39;t sound like good Op Sec to me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s really not that simple. Both sides have partial information, but one side has the NSA and military intelligence networks on their side. It&#39;s impossible for the enemy to know what the actual plan is because they can never know what is true and what is intended to keep them guessing. By this point, I think the cabal would have to be fully aware that this is a legitimate operation based on their own information, but that doesn&#39;t help much. Military signals intelligence has robust strategies to communicate true information in a stream of obfuscation for exactly this reason. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Q is a real insider, there is enough evidence to prove this.  But Q is also a propagandist.  I&#39;ve seen theories tossed around that Q may be connected with both the NSA and Mossad.</p>

<p>Q has pretty much taken control of a lot of the talking points and views that alternative and conspiracy news outlets use.  Various topics I see on r/conspiracy was seeded by Q.</p>

<p>At this point, people do not question Trump&#39;s ties with the zionists/neocons/transnational bankers (which is essentially a faction of the deep state), his actions in the middle east, his development of military hostilities in the Pacific, the fact his regime is against peace breaking out between NK/SK, etc...  </p>

<p>Nope, everybody is content with the idea that &quot;the deep state is being taken down&quot;, when in fact, they are just gonna be sitting down, stop doing research, stop complaining, and do nothing.  All while behind the scenes: the deep state is not going anywhere, and is simply undergoing a regime change to one that is loyal to Trump&#39;s neocon factions.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry I&#39;m a normal person who doesn&#39;t keep a copypasta at hand to create a timeline for Q confirmations.</p>

<p>Like I said, he is probably has inside connections, but he also is IMO a propaganda agent, so I&#39;m not surprised if some of the things he says turn out false or distorted.</p>

<p>Do you happen to have the original statements confirming Assange free and Obama serving time?</p>

<p>It would make sense if Q were to say, want us to believe Assange is free just so people don&#39;t resist when they decide to fuck him.  I recollect that in recent news that Assange is being tried in a closed doors court, so here&#39;s a psyop example in which Q-trusting folk would simply believe that it is a trial to free him - but I obviously have my doubts.</p>

<p>No. </p>

<p>You said, &quot;Q is a real insider, there is enough evidence to prove this,&quot; and I&#39;m asking what you would consider <em>conclusive evidence</em>. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve been reading Q posts since last fall; originally I thought it was the same &#39;John&#39; that had posted on 4chan about false flag attacks so i twas super interesting. </p>

<p>Since then I&#39;ve tried to follow it, including reading far more Jerome Corsi Tweets than I care to admit so I feel like I&#39;m fairly well-versed on the topic at hand but I cannot point to a single piece of <em>conclusive evidence</em> that points to him as an insider. </p>

<p>I also cannot tell you for certain that Q said Obama was in Gitmo and Assange was free or if it was someone <em>interpreting Q&#39;s posts</em> that came to this conclusion. </p>

<p>I wasn&#39;t trying to be an ass I just thought maybe you had some evidence I hadn&#39;t seen. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>For simplest evidence: being able to simply predict or coincide his activity with Trump&#39;s tweets is enough &quot;coincidence&quot; for me to believe he has a connection to Trump.  Doesn&#39;t mean he&#39;s a &quot;white hat&quot; as most people would conclude, just means he has a connection to Trump, possibly as a propagandist.</p>

<p>His posts have vague predictive content, his communication style is vague in general.  In any case, I&#39;ve come less to question whether he is real, and more to question his agenda.  Real or not, the effect his posts have in &quot;seeding&quot; a large amount of discussions is very real.  Just a simple glance at this comment section is testimony to Q&#39;s influence: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yqa5PUViPo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yqa5PUViPo</a></p>

<p>Q -&gt; seeds anon discussion -&gt; spreads like wildfire through alt news -&gt; reaches a large amount of different social groups (including r/conspiracy), sometimes people will not even reveal that they got their talking point from Q</p>

<p>I just think at this point people should be discussing Q&#39;s agenda, and whether we should be trusting someone whom is reminiscent of Alex Jones.  It&#39;s very hard to find this kind of discussion because most people are either completely on-board the Q agenda, or trying to discredit Q, very few people are calling it a psy-op.  Here&#39;s a rare tuber who has the psy-op perspective <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGWf0qXIS5s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGWf0qXIS5s</a></p>

<p>To call it a psy-op means we accept that Q has connections to the deep state (and yes, we align Trump to the deep state), but reject Q&#39;s agenda.</p>

<p>Anyway, let me know if you find that Obama Assange statement, I don&#39;t follow too hard so much as me just trying to stay aware of where the topics rolling into this sub are coming from.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>His agenda seems to be pretty simple to me, he is trying to <em>sow distrust in our populace</em> and trying to make Trump <em>appear to be working behind the scenes to drain the swamp</em> when there is no evidence this is actually taking place.</p>

<p>If we look at his cabinet appointments and the policies they&#39;re passing, it seems pretty clear what <em>Trump&#39;s agenda is</em> and I don&#39;t see it aligning with Q thus far.</p>

<p>The things I see Q say is <em>we are going after the child predators</em> and shit that all Americans should/would support</p>

<p>With regards to that first video, I see people trying to claim <em>that was an attempt on Trump&#39;s life</em> but that vehicle sure doesn&#39;t appear to be the type that can be controlled remotely; even though I am aware that tech does exist in almost all newer vehicles.</p>

<p>Also, if you watch that video, the car makes <em>no attempt to even enter the roadway</em> and clearly appears to have no ill-intent. If you wanted to try and cause a car accident with the Presidential limo train, there would be much easier ways than driving through the forest. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know this doesn&#39;t answer your question (and I hope this doesn&#39;t detract from your post), but I think people of all stripes need to ask themselves three questions whenever they see an &quot;anonymous source&quot; cited:</p>

<p>1.) Did the source provide any sort of documentary evidence or proof for their claim?</p>

<p>2.) Are any other verifiable sources cited as making a similar claim?</p>

<p>3.) Is there a clear timeline of when we can expect to find out if said source&#39;s claims are true?</p>

<p>If the answer to all three is &quot;no,&quot; I think people need to take any claims made by said anonymous source with a grain of salt. I think all &quot;sides&quot; are guilty of this; many MSM reports about &quot;Russiagate&quot; have relied on anonymous sources whose assertions either remain unproven (but are accepted as fact), or have been outright disproven, yet many liberals still accept them as gospel.</p>

<p>That being said, Q Anon is far less credible than even the most sloppily cited Russiagate claims. He&#39;s a guy on 4chan who writes vague riddles, occasionally makes predictions (the more specific of which never come true), and offers wild claims without any documentary evidence. I believe the wide acceptance of his claims comes from </p>

<p>1.) A hunger for them to be true (confirmation bias, basically)</p>

<p>2.) The fact that he&#39;s <em>not</em> MSM (therefore, he <em>must</em> be credible). </p>

<p>Every article and claim (be it from <em>The New York Times</em> or some yahoo on 4chan) should be critically assessed, and vigorously interrogated for corroborating evidence/sources/facts. Sometimes, the MSM (often the same outlet) can provide unsoruced propaganda in one article, and credible, revelatory journalism in another.</p>

<p>At their best, conspiracy theorists are vigorous skeptics who demand a high standard of proof, and don&#39;t believe <em>any</em> story (official or otherwise) unless it meets a high bar of evidence. At their worst, conspiracy theorists believe what they <em>want</em> to believe, in spite of evidence or contradictions in their own reasoning. The QAnon fanboys (and FBIAnon fanboys before him) fall into the latter category.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The allegations regarding the Clinton Foundation and Haiti were actually fairly vague. Most of his/her posts were along the lines of &quot;The Clinton Foundation is filled with dirty money, they&#39;ve fleeced Haiti, and the email scandal is (mostly) a distraction from the corruption of the foundation, and how it fits into the global power structure.&quot;</p>

<p>No proof was given for these claims, nor were they particularly revelatory. We&#39;d already known The Clinton Foundation was steeped in dirty money, and that they&#39;d fleeced Haiti, so these allegations could easily have been made by a focused LARPer.</p>

<p>Furthermore, many predictions they <em>did</em> make turned out to be false. They flatly stated, &quot;If Trump wins, HRC will be prosecuted;&quot; this did not happen. They said &quot;The Fed will be a main target of Trump I am sure, since they manipulate so much economic activity in favor of the wealthy&quot;; this did not happen. They also claimed Bill Clinton would be dead by the end of the year; nearly two years on, he&#39;s still with us.</p>

<p>So, while one can argue that FBIAnon was interesting, there was no proof (or even evidence) that they were real; yet, their claims were eagerly treated as gospel by many here. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a sad day when OP links r/politics. That pretty much sums up what happened to this sub. </p>

<p>So basically what we have is people running interference for the normies. This sub is mainstream now. So when people come here thinking &quot;Hey what&#39;s all this q stuff&quot; they&#39;re unlikely to go and find out for themselves. Instead they rely on other people&#39;s opinions.</p>

<p>So, posts like these serve to run interference and keep people in the dark. Normies might read through the comment section a bit, but then it just becomes a propaganda game. I&#39;m one person, and if two people disagree with me, then anyone reading who doesn&#39;t know any better will too. </p>

<p>That&#39;s why I play my own game. SO, if you want proof that Q is the real deal, message me in private. To everyone else who knows he&#39;s the real deal, get people to message you in private. And make sure you read through a user&#39;s post history first, otherwise they&#39;re going to use the information you give them for a new spin and feed it to the mainstream people who come here. These people are smart and dedicated. Don&#39;t play their game. Play your own. </p>

I have mentioned this before but I think that Q is Roger Stone, Steve Bannon, Don Jr, Assange or maybe Alex Jones for that matter. I think that Steve Bannon saw the Trump supporter data on Breitbart when certain conspiracy stuff came up, same with Jones, same with Stone&#39;s tweets, etc... and have crafted Q&#39;s &quot;intel drops&quot;(lol) based on their data. Q has tweeted things that Trump tweeted just a few mins later, which just drives them crazy into believing this stuff. I think it is all a ruse to distract them and keep them even more attached and loyal to him, for life for that matter. It also poisons the well on ANY of the evidence that comes from the Mueller probe if it lands on Trump. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Herd theory. If people see things/entities that they trust, trust something than they will be more likely to trust it as well. It&#39;s also extremely easy to fake such trust and make it seem as if people aren&#39;t being extremely critical about it by just manipulating the conversation, vote count, or displaying it on numerous sources to make it seem as if it&#39;s more legit. In general people are very curious about claims and in will question them quite frequently but it&#39;s hard to notice it because the narratives are controlled in main stream news/media as well as online. So when you take into account the majority of all &quot;top&quot; comments being most likely fake or inflated and the inverse(lowest scoring being closer to the actual consensus of people&#39;s thoughts) being true you&#39;ll notice that things aren&#39;t nearly as bad as you think they are.</p>

<p>The statements you were responding to made it very clear that the administration was meticulously careful and responsible about the release of classified information to the Russians in the sense that they only shared what was necessary for Russian intelligence to be aware of a specific threat which both nations face.
