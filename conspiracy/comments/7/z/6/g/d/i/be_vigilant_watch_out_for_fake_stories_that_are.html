        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It appears like the MSM is starting to go attack-mode on conspiracy theories.  One of the techniques used to discredit this community is the insertion of conspiracy theories that can be easily disproved.  An example of this occurred yesterday:</p>

<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7z397h/photobook_claiming_crisis_actor_went_to_completly/">David Hogg didn&#39;t attend Parkland high school went viral</a></p>

<p>When this was posted yesterday I stated:</p>

<p>&quot;This seems like deliberate misinformation to discredit other claims. The media could easily prove this claim was false, and then associate all other claims with this false claim.&quot; </p>

<p>Fake conspiracy theories are especially dangerous because we are essentially discrediting ourselves.  Now, more than ever, it is important to search for evidence and motives before making claims.  </p>

<p>I disagree. The agenda he has show is an interest in journalism. That is different from politics. And even if he had a political agenda to begin with that should not negate his message. You are attacking an 18 year olds character, how about sticking to his message? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Having a political agenda and then using a tragedy to exploit it certainly undermines someone’s message.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You are attacking an 18 year olds character,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Where did I do that? By stating facts?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>how about sticking to his message? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Okay. His message is stupid. It’s the same rhetoric that happens after each shooting: “something must be done! Their blood is on Trump’s hands.” (He literally said that last part.)</p>

<p>Okay, like what? Background checks? Already exist. Waiting periods? Already exist. Outlawing automatic weapons? Done. </p>

<p>He says he is pro 2nd Amendment, yet wants some “action” to keep guns out of the hands of people who kill kids (again, his own words). That already exists. Criminals will ignore any and every law people try to put out there. That’s why they are criminals. They do not care about the law. </p>

<p>This school shooter CLEARLY had no respect for the “gun free zone” that was established at the school. So what law will help? What law will prevent this from happening? Other than disarming law abiding citizens, there aren’t any laws that will help.</p>
