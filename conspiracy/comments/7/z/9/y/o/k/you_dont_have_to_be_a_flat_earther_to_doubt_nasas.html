<p>The other benefit for TPTB of the NASA vs Flat Earth false dichotomy is that it keeps people away from thinking about the <a href="https://www.johnlebon.com/key-topics/cavendish-experiment/">absurdities</a> of the official story.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So what step2thejep just did is post a link to his own website. Step2thejep is likely John Le Bon, and he is is here to shill his website that charges $20+/mo. Or he is here to shill his videos, that direct you to his site. </p>

<p>He shills this particular link all the time. Why? It is one of the few free posts on his website. </p>

<p>As for his dislike of Cavendish&#39;s measurment of G? Well his evidence against it is that the experiment was done in a shed and surely you can not make a discovery in a shed... except Cavendish was experimentally measuring G, subsequent more advanced experiments have confirmed. The gravitational constant used in modern physics text books builds on cavendish&#39;s work, but is based in centuries of experiments that are continually refined. </p>

<p>Step2thejep won&#39;t tell you what he believes, but as far as I can tell he does not believe in a round earth, space, the moon, the sun, atoms, evolution, missiles, all of history (ancient greeks to nikola tesla), dinosaurs, or that anyone has died in any current, recent war/conflict/mass casualty event. </p>

<p>He makes decent money of off his site. He has 50 subscribers as he just announced and at 240/year gets around $10-12K off of this... but of course he wants more.</p>

<p>He was banned from crypto currency reddits so he mostly shills here. The rest of the time he attacks other users with demands for impossible evidence, ridicule, and condescension and when he thinks he has shown his genius inserts one of his links.</p>

<p>Most of his theories are rooted in a lack of understanding of basic science and research principles and he never admits being wrong which makes me conclude he is either a con man or the dunning Kruger effect in person. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>For me, a lot of the NASA conspiracies I hear are just too big to be feasible as far as I&#39;m concerned. I don&#39;t think teams of hundreds and thousands of people can effectively keep secrets as big as some of the ones I hear proposed. Do I think NASA has a significant military component? Probably. Do I think space has been weaponized? Maybe. Do I think we never went to the moon because someone thinks they know how things should look on the moon? Eh, seems more likely that we did go than we didn&#39;t, at this point.</p>

<p>Most people at NASA were doing specific jobs and wouldn’t need to be made aware. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So I just spent the last little while looking at lander pics. To me, nothing seems too odd. I was big into space as a kid, and among the interesting facts I remember is that there were some parts of the orbiter that were only a few milimeters of, basically, aluminum foil keeping the astronauts from the cold, dead vacuum of space. It&#39;s not like there&#39;s an atmosphere to contend with so the designers cut weight anywhere and everywhere they could. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not to be rude but cognitive dissonance is getting in your way, being a space kid and all. Its understandable to not want to think about some of your best memories or aspirations being based on lies. </p>

<p>In regards to the structural integrity of the lander, think about this. The amount of force of the pressurized lander exerting outward towards the perfect vacuum of space, would rival if not be more intense than that of a the ocean against a submarine deep underwater. </p>

<p>The shity riveting, the warping of the metals, is clear evidence it couldn’t withstand the pressure. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>On mobile but will try to find links in a bit. One of the scariest things is how a vacuum lowers the boiling point. In a perfect vacuum water can boil at around 40 degrees Fahrenheit. </p>

<p>NASA doesn’t practice in vacuums because it’s too dangerous. There was an accident with an experiment in a vacuum at no where near the level of space. After about 6 seconds of being exposed to the vacuum because of an equipment breakdown, the training astronaut’s saliva began to boil in his mouth. He then almost instantly passed out. </p>

<p>Vacuums are insanely dangerous. Yet this seems to be no concern to NASA. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, you COMPLETELY missed the point.</p>

<p>The vacuum of space is just 0 PSI of pressure, compared to 14.7 PSI at sea level...</p>

<p>Meaning, a spacecraft pressurized to atmospheric pressure has to only contain 14.7 PSI of pressure...</p>

<p>How do you think 14.7 PSI is a lot of pressure? Like i said, my gas grill&#39;s propane tank literally holds 10-15x that pressure for a virtually unlimited time without leaking or blowing up.</p>

<p>What dont you get about the fact that &quot;the vacuum of space&quot; compared to sea level atmospheric pressure is 14.7 PSI of pressure...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have no idea how vacuums work. It’s not just 1-0. It’s not just 14.7psi pushing against 0 psi. </p>

<p>As vacuums get closer to “absolute” vacuum (as space is said to be) the amount of Torr increases exponentially. </p>

<p>They can completely crush oil tankers by using vacuums and by using your logic, the  force crushing them would only be 14.7 psi. </p>

<p>Inverse this scenario in space, a true vacuum that is ever expanding, and you get and insane amount of outward pressure space vehicles would have to compensate for. </p>

<p>Don’t try to disprove me with an obvious falicy and lack of knowledge about the very subject we are debating. </p>

<p>Here’s a link to torr and how it exponentially increases.

    <div class="md"><p>Oh good you misinterpreted the chart you wanted to disprove me with. Do you even know what Torr is? Ill explain. </p>

<p>Its a mesure of pressure... and those exponents in the chart ARE NEGATIVE EXPONENTS. Seriously you just told me that Torr increases exponentially then link to a chart that you dont even know how to read, which literally proves you wrong.</p>

<p>Perfect vacuum would be 0 Torr. 10<sup>-16</sup> Torr is LOW pressure, but its not even a perfect vacuum. Notice the NEGATIVE EXPONENTS FFS.</p>

<p>The &quot;outward pressure&quot; on the spacecraft hull is a MAXIMUM of 14.7 pounds per square inch, if they pressurize it to sea level on Earth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have never heard any version of the Moon Landing Conspiracy that required more than a handful of participants. Please tell me where you heard this version.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve watched a couple dozen people chatter on about the &quot;moon hoax&quot;, but none of them was crazy enough to assert a theory that required that many participants.</p>

<p>Almost without exception, the serious researchers (not the newer flat earth crew) believe that the conspirators were faking signals to mission control, to fool the guys looking at the instruments.</p>

<p>They had the capability to do this, because they routinely used this capability to do mock runs for practice. They built movie sets and test footage of the landing so the astronauts could practice, as well.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve never heard the &#39;hundreds or thousands&#39; of involved people theory you cite. The four main conspiracies I know of, which have some good evidence are, 
1. The death of the first Apollo flight crew. (HUGE tragedy).
2. The Apollo Manned Moon Landings.
3. The Challenger Disaster.
4. The Mars Rover.</p>

<p>All of these have numerous theories surrounding them, but none that I can find, with any popularity (Excluding the flat earth crew) require more than 30-50 people... For the Challenger disaster, it could be done with 20.</p>

<p>You&#39;ve obviously never heard of compartmentalization then.

    <div class="md"><p>yes, I also believe that the flat earth theory was created to discredit the fake moon landings supporters.</p>

<p>Once you look seriously into the moon missions there&#39;s only one conclusion. NASA never got to the moon.</p>

<p>Is simple, yet complicated. If 9/11 can be reduced to crooked politicians and shadowy power groups as damage control, the moon landings means the science itself lied to the people. The government, the media, scientists, everyone. There&#39;s no other conclusion to be drawn.</p>

<p>If you are sincere and you want to know the truth check the hard facts, the photos, the flimsy module made from aluminum foil and adhesive tape, the heavy radiation they supposedly had the technology to protect from but NOW we need to find a solution if we want to go back to the moon. And on and on.</p>

<p>The moon landings are one of the few conspiracy theories which gets ridiculed on this sub. You can talk about flat earth how much you want but not this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What about the official photos?</p>

<p>And the second part of what you said doesnt make sense. If nasa was faking a moon landing, and they had official original tapes to delete, why would those tapes be known about, much less recorded in the first place?</p>

<p>A bad idea to create incriminating evidence  when faking something, dont you think?</p>

<p>Despite having family who launched people into space for decades, i have questioned the moon landing myself. There is so much bullshit out there about the conspiracy of a moon landing hoax, and so many bad theories, and so much obvious engineering reality for something supposedly so fake, it seems likely to me that its real. Would be pretty hard to fake the low gravity videos of the module ascent, the people fucking around on the moon surface too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>at the time of the fake moon landings there were no digital camera to take on the moon so they take film cameras (both for photography and for film)</p>

<p>when people asked for the original film material that was brought back from the moon NASA said they have lost it.</p>

<p>analyzing this material would had proven if it was filmed on the moon or not. Guess no way to tell this now.</p>

<p>About your &quot;hard to do&quot; answer. Nothing is hard to do if you have billions of dollars in your pocket.</p>

<p>They also didn&#39;t do such a great job of faking it so your &quot;hard to do&quot; is ironically true.</p>

<p>They did their best for that time, now it just to keep people noses out of it.</p>

<p>Flat earth, just another tactic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I respect your conclusion and your opinion. Comparing the difficulty of going to the moon and fake the landings is not correct. It will always be more easy and more convenient to fake them.</p>

<p>The tech from 60s can&#39;t fake the landings but can get us to the moon? Are you trying to be funny :-)?</p>

<p>And they didn&#39;t do a perfect job of faking the landings, just something good for the era.</p>

<p>Now is simple to find the errors with all the technology we all have. So better not let the people check by themselves</p>

<p>when people asked for the original film material that was brought back from the moon NASA said they have lost it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fyi: this is incorrect. NASA still has the still photos and video film taken on the moon, they were never lost.</p>

<p>What was lost/destroyed was the live analog broadcast as it was received in Australia. There were two types of video camera on the moon, the 16mm Maurer film camera and the television broadcast camera. The television camera only worked at 10 frames per second, and in order to convert it live from transmission to the US (the radio signal was received in Australia because the landing happened at night), the only technology available was to use a kinescope, which was a 30 fps camera pointed at a 10fps tv monitor.</p>

<p>The original broadcast was recorded and NASA had copies, but they recorded over them in the 80s due to a tape shortage. The 10 fps/low resolution video wasn&#39;t considered to be important scientifically, so it was low priority for preservation.</p>

<p>The Mauser camera film is still available, same with the photographs, just not the slightly higher quality original live television broadcast.</p>

<p>There are 4 film materials from Apollo 11</p>

<p>1) hasselblad 70mm film camera. Originals exist in storage at NASA, high quality scans available online</p>

<p>2) Maurer 16mm video film camera, originals exist in storage at NASA, medium quality copies available online (this camera never went outside)</p>

<p>3) Apollo TV camera, broadcast live at 10 fps, recorded in Australia and sent to NASA, no known originals or copies exist.</p>

<p>4) kinescope broadcast live from Australia, numerous copies exist onlone and offline, varying but very low quality.</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>

<p>I mean, you can&#39;t just walk in off the street and go see them, but they still exist and are available to people that have a reason to see them. The high quality copies online should be good enough for most investigations. Please provide proof or citation for the physical film that was on the moon having been destroyed, the only film lost is the Apollo 11 live television analog broadcast</p>

<p>1) Create a  clever campaign to ridicule anybody daring to ask a question or point out the obvious.</p>

<p>2) Make sure to have &quot;Our greatest accomplishment&quot; mentioned over and over again to drill it into our psyche that we went.</p>

<p>3) Have future Moon missions like &quot;China&quot; purposely created to look &quot;retro&quot; to look just like the way they filmed it in the 60&#39;s. So all future pictures and video have to be CGI or trick photography. They can never undo this because it will prove the original video was fake.</p>

<p>4) Create the &quot;flat-earth&quot; conspiracy to blur all space conspiracies into one nauseous roundabout.</p>

<p>5) Get Joe Rogan to reverse course on previous theories.. Create a sidekick that is the &quot;flat earther&quot; to look ridiculous and make Joe who now believes &quot;we went to the moon&quot; seem more plausible.</p>

<p>Did a man go to the moon or not? I think they have but not what was shown.</p>

<p>Growing up I loved NASA. Space camp would have been a dream of mine when I was younger. I&#39;m not trying to bash NASA.</p>

<p>I definitely do not understand everything in the world so my opinion is really just that.</p>

<p>I do appreciate a civil discussion with you. Its rare on here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I looked for errors and inconsistencies in Moon footage, stills etc. I cant find any that convinced me it was faked, but i do still wonder if it was faked. A lot of the Moon astronauts did exhibit strange behaviors, which is what gave me the most doubt that they went.</p>

<p>I would honestly like to see convincing evidence that the Moon stuff was actually faked, but so far what ive found is mostly errors made by people trying to prove it was a hoax.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agree, a lot of people who don&#39;t believe in flat earth question NASA..and I defiantly believe the moon landing was fishy.</p>

<p>Remember Gus Grissom was supposed to be the first man on the moon, and after being very critical of the moon landing mission admitting they were no where near ready to go to the moon died with two other men soon after.</p>

<p>There is an episode on this on the Netflix &quot;conspiracies&quot; series.</p>

<p>Sorry, which one of us made a post saying that NASA&#39;s achievements were fake, thus taking the burden of responsibility? Oh, it was you? </p>

<p>Hmmmmmmmm.....</p>

<p>By limiting exposure and skirting around them. Your question is answered by the most simple Google search ever.</p>

<p>Good job misinterpreting that guys point. He was saying that NASA <em>currently</em> does not have a complete spacecraft that is capable of space travel. The Orion capsule is currently being built and tested and will perform a flyby of the moon sometime 2019-2020.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>You mean the underwater training that Astronauts have to endure? That&#39;s because it simulates weightlessness buddy. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>I can find no reference to this on the Internet. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Doesnt change the fact that youre  saying they had the advanced tech and billions of dollars to fake low gravity and build huge real rockets that thousands of people watched in person and millions watched on tv, and even if compartmentalized, had thousands of people designing and building them, with the engineering and scientific knowledge enough to know &quot;hey this thing wont actually work!&quot;</p>

<p>I personally watched, heard most all of the Space Shuttle launches. Why build something that CAN physically do all these things, but then secretly fake it?</p>
