        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I bought a big bag of baking soda at Costco a couple of years ago which I use for <a href="http://www.allyou.com/budget-home/live-green-save/baking-soda">various things around the house</a>, but the big surprise was that since I&#39;ve been brushing my teeth with baking soda (and nothing added to it, such as crushed dried mint leaves) my dentist tells me that my dental health is greatly improved compared to a few years ago when I was using toothpaste.  I&#39;m 69 so this has been a wonderful surprise for me.  I&#39;m saving $300 a year by not having a professional cleaning done anymore.  Medicare doesn&#39;t cover any dental issues.</p>

<p>Why is this in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>?  Well, because the companies that make toothpaste and other products with baking soda in them have basically tricked us all into thinking that we actually need their products: toothpaste, teeth whiteners, alka seltzer, etc.  It&#39;s simply not true that we need to buy toothpaste to have good dental hygiene!  The list of things we can use baking soda for, and save money by using it for these things, is a very long one!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I felt <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> was appropriate in this case because much of what we buy these days is, quite frankly, artificial and unnecessary.  Toothpaste is on that list, in my opinion, not the least for the fact that it is not as effective in achieving and maintaining dental health as Baking Soda is.  I don&#39;t like being manipulated.  </p>

<p>I myself wouldn&#39;t use Peroxide unless I had inflamed gums, and even then, not for a long term.  Peroxide is great if you need to get your hands really clean, however.</p>

After a while you get pretty good at remembering things you&#39;ve been exposed to which you are interested in.  The first time I got interested in the mohs scale of measuring hardness was in the 80&#39;s when I was buying touchscreen glass and integrating touchscreens Cathode Ray Tubes (internally a near vacuum which implodes if you break it).  The touchscreen sensor overlay had a hardness which was much higher than the CRT itself.  I remember one day that someone deliberately hit the touchscreen with a hammer.  They broke the touchscreen glass sensor but the touchscreen sensor was strong enough to prevent the CRT behind it from breaking and imploding.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The safety of dentifrices containing baking soda has been extensively studied.15, 18, 19 Researchers in both clinical and laboratory studies have found these products to be safe, to be low in abrasiveness, to not contribute to root sensitivity, and to be safe for use by patients on low-salt diets. This latter finding is important, given that patients swallow 5% to 7% of a dentifrice with which they brush.20</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We do it together. We grab the jar, get a big heaping spoonful of coconut oil, and set a timer. Sometimes we sit together and draw or write funny notes to each other (since we can&#39;t talk while swishing). Or we&#39;ll build legos, etc....  at first it was a challenge, a few years back, to get him to oil pull with me. He could only go about 4 to 6 minutes before freaking out and spitting it out in the trashcan, it takes time to get used to the taste. But also, I showed him several pictures of nasty teeth on the internet and showed him what can happen to unhealthy gums (lovely parental scare tactics). He&#39;s come a long way, and now, 20 minutes on the clock seems like nothing at all. We try to do it once to twice a week. Also, we still use traditional toothpaste twice a day (non fluoridated toothpaste), so coconut oil pulling is just an extra step we take to protect our mouths. And for real, his dentist is always very impressed with his teeth when we see her every six months. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You get a jar of (unrefined, expeller/cold pressed) coconut oil, grab a big spoonful, and put it in your mouth. It quickly turns from a solid to a liquid, and you swish that around and let it soak into your teeth for 15-20 minutes. It removes toxins, can reverses cavities and kills bacteria. It leaves your mouth feeling so incredibly clean! Im definitely grateful to have found and tried this home remedy.  The taste takes some getting used to. That&#39;s probably the hardest part, is accepting the taste, if you don&#39;t really dig coconut flavor. But after a few minutes it just feels like thick water swishing around in your mouth, its really not so bad. If you do try it, I&#39;d like to advise spitting it out in to a trashcan, not down the drain/sink. The build up of oil in the drain will eventually become a clog.  But other than that, coconut oil pulling is wonderful and leaves your breath nice a fresh and gives you a whole-mouth clean! Love it! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We go for once to twice a week. I wish I had taken some before and after pictures, way back when i first discovered oil pulling (about three years ago).  I was completely shocked that it gradually reversed all the dark spots in my teeth. I didn&#39;t believe it would actually work, but it did! I suppose back then I was doing it more like five days a week, because I wanted to keep up the results I was seeing. After all the dark spots had become white teeth again,(which probably happened over the course of a few weeks or so) I slowed down to just maintaining my progress with once to twice a week.  I&#39;ve read that some people convert to strictly oil pulling, and give up traditional teeth brushing all together, but Im not that dedicated. Plus I enjoy the clean, just-brushed feel that only a toothbrush can give me. Oil pulling is wonderful in its own way though.  Our teeth are porous like a sponge, they just soak the coconut oil right up and they love it! </p>

<p>Its very important to use unrefined coconut oil though, it has to say its expeller or cold pressed.  Otherwise you&#39;ll be buying coconut oil that&#39;s been overly processed from a factory, and all its nutrients/health benefits get super heated and destroyed before it even hits the shelf.  Oh and one last note! Its also great to eat raw coconut oil, it has a slew of health benefits and our brains love the healthy fats. BUT, you do not want to swallow the same coconut oil that just you oil-pulled with. Once the 15-20 minutes are up, spit that out in a trashcan. It just removed toxins and germs and bacteria, etc from your whole mouth, and you don&#39;t wanna swallow that!  I saw people asking that on a forum once, so now I always make sure to just mention it, just in case.  Okay, good luck, I hope you&#39;ll give it a try! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes it is! The only requirement is that it should be organic, and must be expeller pressed (cold pressed). If it doesn&#39;t say its expeller pressed, then its been super-heated and treated/processed at the factory, and has already lost its nutrients and beneficial goodness.  But otherwise, yes, it is the same coconut oil you can cook with or use in recipes. </p>

<p>If you&#39;re bored, do an image search online for &quot;coconut oil pulling reverse cavities&quot;.  I wish I had taken my own before and after photos, because I have personally reversed three deep, dark spots in my molars just by oil-pulling the toxins out of my teeth. And has helped keep my son cavity-free, this stuff is incredible!  Its definitely worth looking in to!  </p>

I see people on this sub being worried about aluminum, I don&#39;t think people realize that it is an extremely abundant element - actually the most abundant metal in the earth&#39;s crust.

<p>Similarly, use vinegar for underarm deoderant. Cheaper, non-toxic. But if you&#39;re eating right - fresh fruits and vegetables -- you won&#39;t need any deodorant at all, believe it or not. (I imagine this is how animals can smell the difference between herbivores and carnivores -- herbivores don&#39;t have meat rotting in their gut and toxic waste coming out their pores.)</p>

My regular dentist insists that I&#39;m in the best dental health she&#39;s ever seen me.  When the hygienist cleans my teeth they measure the separation of my gums from my teeth.  Before I used baking soda I was getting a lot of 4, 5 &amp; 6 measurements.  The last time I had a cleaning, about a month ago, I had all 2 &amp; 3 measurements.  That right there tells you that my gums are not only healthier but that they are moving up against my teeth a lot better than they have in a long time.</p>

The thing about my personal situation and I share this with many people, is that you have great benefits from your employer while working there but you lose those benefits when you retire. What happens next is that Medicare coverage begins but there is absolutely no Dental Care in Medicare, so you are on your own, along with everybody else from the age of the 60s onward.

    <div class="md"><p>That’s not all, shaving of most of the body hair off may or may not have been a result of a really good ad campaign directed towards women.  I recall reading or hearing a discussion on it, and the issue revolves around shaving companies trying to find a way to open the market to women to make more money.  This began an ad campaign designed to create the impression that smooth and hairless was more aesthetically pleasing so women started buying razors.</p>

<p>I personally think there was also a side effect to this I regards to porn companies.  If you watch more vintage porn you don’t see as much, for lack of a better term right now, crotch shaving.  This began to change and I think what encouraged this was the idea that younger women were more attractive than older women, so shaving of the privates was done to make the woman seem younger.  For guys it was done because shaving improved the appearance of size.  Just want to reiterate this last paragraph is just personal opinion because I never looked to see if I’m correct.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My advantage is that I am 69 and can tell you that NOBODY used to shave their privates except unless you got &#39;the crabs&#39;, and getting the crabs was common enough.  Regarding shaving, well, if you&#39;re gonna shave, then shave in the direction your hair grows, and certainly not against it.  Since we&#39;re on the topic, I&#39;ll state that (being a man) I shave the part of my chest closer to my neck every month or so because if I don&#39;t then when I&#39;m lying down watching TV with no shirt on then the hair on my chest tickles my throat and I can&#39;t stand that.  I also shave under my arms every couple of weeks (while in the shower) because underarm odor comes largely from perspiration residue on the hair there.  I would like to think that we all could comfortably share information about hygiene.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Years ago I saw a video by a dentist that recommended brushing with baking soda and gargling with diluted hydrogen peroxide. I tried it for 3 weeks and my teeth were the whitest. Then I had a dental appointment. The hygienist asked how I got my teeth so white, when I told her she said don&#39;t brush with baking soda, you will wear the enamel off your teeth. So I went back to regular toothpaste and my teeth got yellow again.</p>

<p>Couple of months after that, they brought out baking soda toothpaste.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve posted this once before when the topic came up.  I haven&#39;t brushed my teeth in about 10 years.  I was always into nutrition, and about 10 years ago I discovered Weston A Price.  The idea is that your teeth are a reflection of your overall health.  Based on his study of people around the world, he noticed that people who have a good amount of healthy animal fats in their diet tended to have nice teeth.</p>

<p>Around the same time, I also did research into raw veganism and tried it out for a while.  I noticed among the raw vegan community, the issue of teeth problems was a reoccurring topic.  I&#39;ve read of more than a few young, raw vegans having severe teeth problems to the point that they bite into something like an almond and a tooth literally crumbles away.  The raw vegan community blames the all the sugar and says that when this happens its because people aren&#39;t brushing enough.  Many people on this diet brush their teeth 5 or 6 times per day, and yet their teeth still crumble away.  I became convinced that it wasn&#39;t the sugar doing this; it was the lack of healthy animal fats as Weston A Price wrote about.</p>

<p>That gave me the confidence to stop brushing my teeth, and as I said I haven&#39;t brushed my teeth in 10 years.  About 2 years after I stopped brushing I went to the dentist and was pretty nervous.  They cleaned my teeth and said I was doing a great job brushing but to try to floss a little more haha.  </p>

<p>Also, if brushing protects your teeth, why do very elderly people always have dentures?  Do old people just stop brushing?  No, its because your teeth are basically like bones.  Good bone health probably equals good teeth health.  Poor bone health (eating nothing but fruit) equals poor teeth health.  </p>

<p>When you think about it, the belief that the health of your teeth is related to the bacteria on the outside of your teeth, and you keep your teeth healthy by scrubbing the outside of your teeth every day, is fucking absurd, but I wouldn&#39;t expect a society that takes pills for everything to have any other opinion regarding dental health.</p>

<p>And no, my breath doesn&#39;t smell bad.  My wife would have no problem telling me if it did.  But as a side note, whenever I meet someone with fucking horrendous breath, I find out they use mouthwash every day.  That&#39;s what causes the bad breath.  It kills all the bacteria in your mouth.  The good bacteria is what keeps the bad bacteria away.  Using mouthwash is bad for your teeth and makes your breath smell like a dumpster</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You make some very good points.  I never use mouth wash, either.  I would say that unless or until anyone understands and achieves everything about one&#39;s diet that you have, they should keep their teeth and gums in good shape with brushing and flossing.  Others here have noted that their very aged parents or grandparents had good teeth as a result of lifelong brushing with baking soda and I can tell you that I can note my own very aged parents and grandparents who did not practice dental hygiene had horrible teeth if they had any at all.</p>

Buying things for your whole life (buying shaving cream, toothpaste, mouthwash, deodorant, etc.) does add up, and if one can manage perfectly fine without them, which many of us here do, I have just learned, then one&#39;s cost of living is noticeably lower, or more efficient.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean I am not saying it isn’t a good idea...  you also avoid fluoride and chemicals.</p>

<p>I just meant that “substantial amount is questionable” especially when toothpaste (and deodorant) are two items in particular that (without being an “extreme couponer”) you can almost always find manufacturer coupons online to get 2 for 1 or less.  Toiletries like deodorant, toothpaste, shampoo and shaving cream (before I converted to safety razors because holy shit that saves money without having to learn to sharpen a straight razor) are a few items that I will find online coupons for and buy a ton for about $1/tube or bottle and just get a year or more supply of all for under $20.</p>

<p>I suppose kind of a tangent since self-sufficiency and natural, non-chemical is best.</p>
