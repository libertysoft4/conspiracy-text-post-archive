<p>You see you just don&#39;t want people to have guns. Unless you really are suggesting we nerf the world, ALMOST ANYTHING CAN BE USED AS A WEAPON.</p>

<p>So by your logic you do not want police officers walking around with weapons of any kind. Or I can&#39;t own a knife, gun, or baseball bat cause it is a weapon that can hurt someone?</p>

<p>And to your below comment...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why the fuck should I pretend listening to a 15 year olds opinion on gun control like they have anything unique or of interest to say. I&#39;m supposed to take the opinion of someone who is STILL LEARNING seriously? You can have an opinion sure, but don&#39;t act like it isn&#39;t completely irrelevant when you are that young.</p>

<p>To reiterate I don&#39;t care that they share their experiences or feelings. Just don&#39;t try and force law changes as an emotional reactionary teenager who still has chores and a bed time.</p>
