    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I have contemplated the truth about one of the lines that they &#39;didn&#39;t bother to sanitize&#39;...it literally won&#39;t leave my head...and it is highly relevant based on a few other historic documents.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The greatest <strong>population regulator of all</strong> does once more what <strong>mankind refuses to do for himself</strong>, ...&quot; pg 6</p>
</blockquote>

<p>First off, none of these events would qualify as &quot;the greatest population regulator of all&quot;...nor would it be relevant in the sense that mankind refused to regulate population for himself...how is that relevant?  This is a comment that wasn&#39;t scrubbed clean.  </p>

<p>The Georgia Guidestones insist that mankind will have a pop exceeding no more than 500,000,000 but why cap it at that number?  Who made this decision and WHY?  What data do they have that we don&#39;t?</p>

<p>Now, in Sumerian tablets Noah was one of the four chosen races of &#39;unclean animals&#39; that &#39;the gods&#39; took onboard THEIR ARK in order to save his life, there was an &#39;exemplary couple&#39; from each race.  Asian (yellow), European (white), Native American (red) and Khoisan (black)...these weren&#39;t &#39;noah&#39;s sons&#39; they were exemplary specimens of humanity by their own right chosen by &#39;the gods&#39;.  And we know that they were considered &#39;unclean&#39; because they went on to the Ark in the ratio of &#39;unclean animals&#39; as a pair and not as a group.  </p>

<p>Now the first thing that Noah does the second he gets off the Ark is murder for God &#39;in thanks&#39; so...not a very good person, because being reintroduced to a pristine and perfect world, he introduces human/animal sacrifice into it, right off the bat (and all his children follow in this same vein of human sacrifice/torture as their patriarch spirit led them [I tend to think of Noah as Khoisan as that is where the &#39;african&#39; values of violence predation, deviance and human sacrifice tend to be strongest]).</p>

<p>Also, of all the races only Whites are in balance or harmony with their environment on a large scale.</p>

<p>Jesus who taught the Tengrist/Turkic (NON-SEMITIC) values of X-INRI or Tengri (the one the jews view as their greatest enemy, the Father in Heaven) though the following; &quot;that Two will be in the field, one will be taken (killed) and the other one left to live&quot; &quot;They did eat, they drank, they married wives, they were given in marriage, until the day that <strong>Noah entered into the ark</strong>, and the flood came, and destroyed them all.&quot; which means that there is no &#39;natural cataclysm&#39; that sparks the death of all mankind...but that the &#39;cleansing cycle&#39; happens after the death of all mankind in order to leave the world in pristine condition for the survivors.  </p>

<p>There is a lot more we can learn from this from the Sumerian records...but the one important take away would be the things that are not said...the things we can glean by reading inbetween the lines of the destroyed documents they will let us see and then correlating them backwards through historic, archetypal and &#39;religious&#39; belief systems.</p>
