        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>There is a global cabal/mafia.
its is the banks and it owns the money supply.  via IMF BIS and world bank.</p>

<p>because they have infinite money, they own nearly EVERTHING via corporations via shell corps and umbrella corps.  its all compartmentalized. so no one part knows what the other is doing unless you are at the top of the pyramid.
they also own... </p>

<p>the housing markets via the banking cartells.</p>

<p>the global food supply .</p>

<p>nearly all world governments have to do their bidding or else they get violently overtaken.</p>

<p>each country has to borrow money from this cabal and pay it back at exorbitant fees.  (many of you will have seen the mafia use this con job back in the day)
this i why every country (even the richest countries?!?!?)  are in debt....</p>

<p>ask who we owe the money to and you will not be given an answer.</p>

<p>they also own all the media</p>

<p>the web/net   was created by them to digitize us so we spend all our days looking at screens.</p>

<p>social security numbers/passports are their way to enter us into the digitized system.  you have become a number rather than flesh.
they own all of the main internet sites...  google youtube, facebook twitter etc etc.</p>

<p>they own reddit too...  thats why this place is dogshit.</p>

<p>they own everything.   and they make us live in this false reality of social engineering and experiments and subtle mind control and training from birth.</p>

<p>what do they want? why do they do this....?     for control and profit.</p>

<p>each country is a farm or plantation if you will.  each is an experiment to see which system is the most effective/ profitable.</p>

<p>no matter which country you live... the goal of the system is to make you work.</p>

<p>you are a slave neo.  we are the bees and they are the beekeepers.</p>

<p>they feed/parasite of your tax money/ your energy-time is converted to honey and they collect it.</p>

<p>they use the honey money to control all the wars and maintain the farms.</p>

<p>everyone in your family has been subjucated to this evil system without knowing.  just like how a wild animal born in captivity does not know any better, you were born into slavery and because even your fellow slaves did not know... you could not know.</p>

<p>only 1 in a million could work it out....  unless someone told you, you could never know.</p>

<p>all the other conspiracies lead to this conspiracy.  so try stay focused, they have well proven ways to make the masses docile.  its hard to stay awake. and sometimes its ok to go back to sleep and have a rest.</p>

<p>but remember the main conspiracy and spread the word as subtle as you can.  if you become a nail they will hammer you. Do not stick your head above the parapet.</p>

<p>Protests and petitions never work don’t bother.  Just concentrate on sowing seeds into the masses.  The only hope is critical mass of awareness.   The 100 monkey syndrome will work.</p>

<p>live by the golden rule of do no harm, and tread lightly.  keep great health and live long to spread the word. the battle is eternal
 and so are you.   :D</p>

<p>Peace be with you</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Excellent thread, my friend. People need to understand this. This is what they want to keep everyone distracted from. People are groomed from childhood to be good, tax paying consumers, and like livestock, our whole environment is highly controlled. They know what will stress us out, what will make us react, how we will react, and how to channel that reaction to benefit them. Mind control on a massive scale using TV, Hollywood, news, music, the list goes on. None of it is really &quot;entertainment.&quot; It&#39;s there to shape your culture and environment and drive you to behave and believe what they want you to. And they&#39;ve been perfecting it since the 20&#39;s after all. I wrote this brief outline of the Tavistock Institute to help explain how we got to this point. Great thread, OP. It&#39;s rare to find such gold here nowadays. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great post. </p>

<p>Keep in mind, we almost actually made it - with the occupy wallstreet movement. The &quot;us vs the 1%&quot; movement. The thing they fear the most finally happened...It all got swept under the rug, and immediately afterwards is when all the partisan, libs vs reps, polarized hate started. That was in response to occupy wallstreet. </p>

<p>What they fear the most right now is occupy wallstreet 2. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its the devil andbim not lying to you. He owns most of those people.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a tidbit. Chakras are not magic lights in your body. They are sectors of the brain that can be controlled like a computer. Once your brain is &quot;mapped&quot; you lose your soul. You lose control of your inner voice and can even lose control ofbthings like your bowels if its bad enough. Ba ankh. Ba is soul and ankh is storage. Bank is Ba ankh and your brain/soul is the money.</p>

<p>Edit: youre not a bee youre a bird. Bees are bad guys. Hive minded gangbstalkers etc... Thosebthatbdo not control their own thoughts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, indeed.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s worth mentioning that the Q anon &quot;calm before the storm&quot; conspiracy theory is a continuation of the story you told. The claim is that patriots within the IC learned their lesson from the assassination of JFK and created a plan to expose and destroy this cabal once and for all, and that this plan is well underway. As unlikely as it may seem, Donald Trump is a central figure in this story (which is why we see so many Trump supporters here).  </p>

<p>The basic premise is the following: Donald Trump learned how this cabal operates through his international business dealings and family connections to law enforcement. He either approached or was approached by individuals in the IC who brought him into this counter-coup plan. They blocked the cyber-attack which intended to weight Diebold machines in several states and prevented the election from being stolen. They have been forcefully ensuring his safety by monitoring and eliminating assassination teams used by the cabal. They have been systematically removing the tools of control which the cabal has relied on for decades, starting with the most critical. Each tool that was neutralized hurt the ability of this cabal to stop them from removing additional tools. Ties have been cut, sources of funding have been frozen, operatives have been removed from power. The Project Mockingbird mainstream media is almost all they have left. The counter-coup group has been slowly sowing seeds of information to wake people up to this reality so that the final stages of the plan can be activated. This part is still underway, and the MSM brainwashing is still extremely powerful. By this summer, the information trail will finally lead to some absolutely shocking revelations and people will be arrested under emergency military powers. Think Nuremberg trials. These people are as bad or worse than the actual Nazis were, they were just better at keeping the masses complacent and unaware, and in the end military tribunals will be used to expose their crimes to the world. Many will be executed for treason and sedition with unassailable hard proof to back up their conviction. The goal is to ensure that no group dares to try to ressurected this plan or anything similar ever again.  </p>

<p>Could all be a big joke or prank or even psyop, but the pieces are staring to come together and people who I have distrusted for years are beginning to seem genuinely panicked.  </p>

<p>I know many of us here are aware of this theory, but it is almost always downvoted to oblivion here, so it is worth mentioning in the context of your post.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know. I won&#39;t lie to you. But for the first time in my life I feel that the positive force in humanity is waking up and anything is possible. I feel in my gut that we are finally about to experience a great awakening unlike anything the world has ever seen. As far as dinner goes, save it. The only thing I would want in that scenario for you is peace, love, and understanding towards yourself and everyone around you who has suffered through this darkness and emerges into the light.</p>
