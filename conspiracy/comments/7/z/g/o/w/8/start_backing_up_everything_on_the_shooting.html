    <div class="md"><p>That video you posted proves nothing. Have you ever been in a war zone under fire from assault rifle? These are traumatized kids. The fact that one scared kid thinks she heard multiple shooters proves nothing. It just an example of how in the choas, we don&#39;t need <strong>more guns</strong>. We don&#39;t need to arm our students and teachers. </p>

<p>Other countries have had this problem and other countries have fixed it. Look to Japan. Look to the U.K. After they they lost their children to massacres like this, their politicians did something and now their children are safe. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My only thought is it may downplay the narrative of the ar15 being a non-stop killing machine. I  remember noticing the headline on the news said something to the effect of &quot;shooter had one ar-15&quot; and the &quot;one&quot; really stood out to me. Like &quot;shooter had <em>an</em> ar-15&quot; would have been just as correct, but they chose that specific word: &quot;one&quot; to have frozen on the screen. I may be totally off-base, just my assessment though. </p>

<p>Yes you can, who says you can&#39;t have both. </p>

<p>One is censorship because of a narrative/agenda and not wanting specific information spread around. The other is abuse against unwilling children and possible weird pedo connections, not really at all comparable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>those are both your extremely skewed and subjective perspectives (one might even say affected by a &quot;narrative/agenda&quot;), so your argument is effectively null.</p>

<p>what if there were other reasons for removing videos like the elsa ones?what if they removed these ones for other reasons?i get recommended continuously conspiracy shit, from the most lunatic to parodies, so why would i believe that youtube actually seeks to &quot;hide the truth&quot; or &quot;to not spread specific information around&quot;</p>

<p>you see man, the problem is your vision is basically a tunnel. you put nothing under a critical lense, or not from what i can see. you dont seek the truth, you seek whatever you want to make yourself feel better. step the fuck out your comfort zone and do some introspection.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve found if you want to download many videos in a row, like downloading a music collection then converting them to MP3s, that you may find it fails after about 6 downloads (per 12 hours maybe?), due to some sort of YouTube rate limiting. It is a little hit or miss though.</p>
