<p>For me, it was the fact that no one actually saw the kid with any weapon. No one saw the kid ever shoot anything. Then, you have the girl who says she was basically walking with him at one point. 
They picked him up on the way to his house? I just wanna know WHY THE HELL people said it was him in the first place. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There was cameras all over the school but the cameras were feeding a stream that was delayed 20 minutes. So when they thought the shooter was in the school he was actually at subway getting a drink. Which to be honest is what made me start questioning. I was skeptical at first but I didn’t want to jump to conclusions. </p>

<p>There are some things I was trying to understand that caused me to start to wonder. </p>

<p>Why isn’t anyone talking about mental health rather than gun bullshit. </p>

<p>How did he get to the school with the gun without being seen? </p>

<p>The girl that was “with him when they heard the first shots fired”
“I’m surprised it wasn’t you.”</p>

<p>The kids in the media and the Snapchat videos that were recorded during the incident heavily pushing gun regulations. </p>

<p>Now the media is talking about arming teachers. </p>

I first became leery of the whole deal when in a newspaper, I read that the kid was hearing distinct voices in his head- and this right after I read about the weird crap going down in Cuban embassies.
These shooters follow a pattern; behavior problems, non attentive adults around them, pharma,- in fact, they are all starting to look alike, even that old man in Las Vegas. They all have the same eyes.
No one is going to notice them slowly being driven crazy. 
And it&#39;s the SAME damned story every time, same bio.
I had a crazy idea that they are using human flotsam to carry out schemes where they are the Sirhan Sirhan on a mass scale.</p>

<p>And then when the PR tour started, so quick and so professional, it&#39;s like those with the mics knew something was going to happen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, right on. Have you seen Louis Theroux&#39;s documentary on the over-drugging. My dad is a retired psychiatrist, so this issue has always been on my mind. </p>

<p>What is encouraging it. Good question. I believe the U.S. is the only western country that allows direct advertising from pharmaceutical companies, for one thing. Some of these drugs are extremely sketchy, like Depakote, for instance, and parents have no idea. They just trust the shrinks, but most of the shrinks are taking bribes from the pharmaceutical industry, which is the single biggest lobbying force in the country. And of course, parents are overworked, and imo all the television especially makes kids very &quot;ADD,&quot; so parents assume corporate drugs are the answer, but they rarely are. They usually have a deadening effect, the exact opposite of what psychedelics do, and people end up hooked on chemical soups produced by profit-driven entities that have little to no interest in our actual well-being. And in the extreme but not super rare cases, some of these psych drugs contribute to or even cause psychosis. Most people would be better off with medical marijuana. </p>

<p>Anyway, what was your experience like as a teenager on anti-depressants and sleep meds? From what I can tell, SSRI&#39;s have probably the least negative side effects of the various classes of pharmaceutics, but I still wouldn&#39;t recommend them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree 100%. My experience was not a good one. Over time I became a zombie and had no interests in anything. I showed no emotion and and lost all drive to want to do anything. I’ve failed suicide attempts, talked to about a dozen psychiatrists and even had a weird puberty. My stomach was already a weak stomach and I’m not sure if the medications did it but now I have really bad acid reflux. </p>

<p>Anyway. I turned 18 and was just fed up with going through the motions at that peak and decided that I shouldn’t need the pills to be happy. So I did what any white kid in the suburbs would do and I started smoking a lot of weed. A lot more than I already was doing. </p>

<p>(I smoked weed occasionally because yeah) </p>

<p>I smoke everyday now. I sleep like a rock and pop up when my alarm goes off. I eat good. My stomach never hurts. My panic attacks stopped 2 years ago. I can talk to people in public. Cartoons are funny again. </p>

<p>Also anytime you hear about a drill, or you see no security footage, or when all the cell phone videos are showing the ground while fun noises play. (every mass shooting in the last 8 yrs)
Or best yet.. And this is the kicker. </p>

<p>When the cell phone footage looks like a flip phone from 1997, even tho everyone around has a smart phone.. </p>

<p>Or the fact that all the security footage is grainy dog shit, even tho 1080p high quality cameras go for pennies. </p>

<p>Or when the crisis victims have rich shit daddies..

    <div class="md"><p>Just to add some skepticism:</p>

<p>MSM is more likely to be just using kids. People, especially teenagers, always dream about what they&#39;d do during a mass shooting, taking down the shooter or doing some other significant thing. MSM gives them to opportunity to get national attention, they&#39;ll obviously take it, even if the lines are scripted. David Hogg appears to be loving the attention particularly, and likely wants his lines scripted so he can act and express himself the way he wants to.</p>

<p>As for the videos, it&#39;s likely they&#39;re withheld due to legal reasons. If something is shown that can reduce the sentence or disrupt the process, it fucks things up and sets a precedent for them to get screwey instead of finished quickly and cleanly. For example, a guy breaking into a house falls and breaks his ankle and is then found and quartered at gunpoint by the home owner. Video footage gives the criminal a case to sue since he was injured on their property, as well as emotional trauma due to being at gunpoint afterwards without being openly threatening. Whether he wins or not, it&#39;s something the home owner doesn&#39;t wanna deal with. Same applies to shootings.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>FBI can&#39;t stop some runt yet they stop tons of them, MSM hypes up and glorifies his murder to turn him into a historic shooter bad guy, MSM soon after interviews a bunch of kids who were far away from the shots with scripted anti gun lines so anyone who doesn&#39;t believe the authenticity of their convictions can be called a monster. Propaganda 101. Next up, during their divorce, the MSM uses their kids to make the judge think they&#39;re the good guy and their partner is the bad guy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I find it strange the victims aren&#39;t being reported on. There is a special group of students that got picked to rep the school and now they&#39;re everywhere? They became pop stars over night because they went to a school that had a shooting? I&#39;m prob gonna get downvoted for this... because I haven&#39;t done a lot of research into this, but... there was literally no time for remorse or anything it was just straight to gun control. There hasn&#39;t really been any rational thinking especially from the left. I didn&#39;t realize how many people I knew that were actually brainwashed by CNN. They don&#39;t have any facts to follow up anything they are putting out on Facebook. They are just repeating CNN and pretending its true. HOW!? They&#39;re the most easily debunked news source! Something strange is going on in USA. That is for sure. I try not to think about it too much because it really works up my anxiety. I guess this is the best place to vent on something like this because it is r/conspiracy but I&#39;m really worried about this country heading to a civil war or the government just straight up taking over. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly I&#39;m worried I&#39;ll get slammed for this- at least I know I would on my other social media because people post &quot;you&#39;re evil if you question the Florida shooting&quot; posts pretty regularly. But anyway, I didn&#39;t even look much into it yet, I&#39;ve just watched the videos. And although I know when people are traumatized they act odd (like, I do). But it just seemed really weird that this was a &quot;media circus&quot; in an instant. Also- it is odd to me (and I haven&#39;t SEEN anyone point it out)- that all of these people come off as quite visibly gay. I don&#39;t mean gay people are idiots- but what I mean is, I feel like it&#39;s quite possible they&#39;re being groomed for this, and I think being gay can already be traumatic (thus, easy grooming) + liberals love using gay people/black people and such for talking points to make their points seem Valid or whatever. I don&#39;t think gay people should be persecuted but with the politics of certain people facing persecution thus their narrative is infallible is one that I&#39;m sure people would be very willing to exploit. Just the way these kids are talking just seems very bizarre- like an older person trying to sound cool and hip almost. Also their social media is weird. But idk. What do I know lol</p>
