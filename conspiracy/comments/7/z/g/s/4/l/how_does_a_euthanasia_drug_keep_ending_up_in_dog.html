    <div class="md"><p>Jesus creeping shit, I never thought of this.  I couldn&#39;t figure this out at all.  I am not sure it is because of dogs being euthanized, however, I suspect it may be horses.  I will definitely look into this, the horse thing is speculation, but I immediately tossed the dog food I used to buy and bought my dog a new one that wasn&#39;t on the list. I couldn&#39;t come up with any reason but sabotage, but what you are saying makes sense.  This isn&#39;t an additive, it is a remainder from the source.  </p>

<p>Great post, and this has been bothering me since I heard about it so I am going to definitely look into your idea.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is what I first thought, it&#39;s from horse meat. But then someone pointed out livestock is not put down with drugs. They are shot/electrocuted or beheaded. They are not going to waster time &amp; money euthanizing livestock. Then it hit me, it has to be dog or cat meat. They are the only animals that are put down with this drug. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They definitely put horses down with drugs, don&#39;t know who told you they behead horses but they were wrong.. I&#39;ve had 2 horses that had to be put down in my life and both were euthanized, and all but one person I know who own horses have only ever had horses euthanized or die of old age. The only one that didn&#39;t had his horse attacked by a pack of coyotes and put it down with his rifle because the horse was in severe pain and had body parts hanging out, but most horses are kept as pets and have vets check them out so end up euthanized in their old age.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh gosh, sorry. I didn’t mean beheading horses. Nor did I mean horses people owned. My niece rodeos, so I know those horses are cared for properly and put down accordingly.</p>

<p>The  horses I was referring to are the wild horses up near North Dakota area. I had a coworker tell me about horses being used in dog food, that’s the only way I knew about it. They used to work rounding up the wild horses and took them to the factories.  I was mortified when he told me that’s what he did for summer work growing up. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ahh ok I got you, that actually kind of makes sense as wild horses absolutely destroy farmland. I know that a lot of people who get their horses put down usually end up calling somebody to &quot;take care&quot; of the corpses afterwards, as it takes a backhoe or other heavy machinery to dig a hole big enough to bury them. I know that a lot of the people who own companies that deal with removing corpses of large animals around here end up selling the meat to pig farmers as &quot;protein&quot;.. Honestly surprised that these drugs have never shown up in the nation&#39;s pork supply, although I&#39;m not sure what types of tests the fda requires on pork or if they even check for it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There’s a very high chance this stuff has made its way into our food supply. Think Taco Bell “meat” products and chicken nuggets... barf!

    <div class="md"><p>Oh yeah food is one rabbit hole I won&#39;t go down to far as I love it too much haha. I definitely have before though and it wasn&#39;t good.. But Idk about other livestock, everyone I know with cows feeds them either grains, corn, or hay depending on the time of the year. The pig farmers I know, granted they aren&#39;t HUGE production farms but do supply a lot of the local pork for the areas stores, feed the pigs day old bread and donuts/sweets that they buy off of the schwebels bakery for a few dollars a truck load and expired meats from stores.. it&#39;s pretty gnarly, but they are killed young enough that they never really exhibit signs of disease or malnourishment so it&#39;s the cheapest way to fatten them up quick for a nice fatty bacon..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have family that raise cattle, they only feed grains and such. But like you said, they are not large producers, so it may be different than larger scale producers. Which is why I try to buy from small local producers, I trust their methods and it&#39;s supporting local farmers. </p>

<p>We should be able to trust our food, we know we can&#39;t. I don&#39;t want to have a panic attack every time I think about eating, so i stay away from that rabbit hole at all costs. Head in the sand over here and I&#39;m ok with that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It may not be a &quot;conspiracy&quot; but it sure as hell isn&#39;t on the up and up. I&#39;m sure no one would be ok with knowingly feeding their pet rendered euthanized pets. </p>

<p>From the article you posted. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Scrupulous pet food companies are never going to condone this, but if they are not testing every batch of the raw ingredients, they could miss it if a supplier decided to defraud them by including cheaper ingredients from sources that may include euthanized animals,” Heinze explained. “It could be similar to the melamine recall [in 2007]. That was malicious fraud intended to make money as previously melamine wasn’t thought to be harmful, but it could be used to make ingredients look higher in protein and thus more valuable.”</p>

<p>But unseemly as feeding pets recycled, rendered meat might sound to owners, Heinze notes that many within and surrounding the pet food industry are unlikely to embrace a wholesale ban on it, even with the risk of accidentally exposing them to euthanized animals. A crackdown on the source of pet food meats would also increase the ecological footprint of the pet food industry.</p>

<p>“[I]t means that lots of nutritious ingredients would potentially go to waste,” she said, “and feeding pets the same foods that people eat increases our pets’ environmental impact considerably.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I stay away from dog food anyways because of the appalling dietary standards and guidelines passed for dogs. If I don&#39;t consider it edible why would I give it to my best bud?</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been feeding mine a raw food diet (90% meat &amp; bones, 10% veg &amp; corn) for about a year. It costs a bit more but he changed completely almost immediately. He had cataracts which disappeared in a week, his physique changed from dumpy to strong and trim in a month and his fur is glossy and fragrant. I haven&#39;t fully showered him in about 5 months and he still looks and smells beautiful. </p>

<p>He also only goes once a day now whereas before youd have to wear a hazmat to go into the garden. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>... is it not completely obvious? the animals used for these pet foods had the drugs in their system at the time they were processed. why does it happen? because certain things sometimes sneak past, making their way into the food despite all our regulations and efforts....  especially when it comes to pet foods. </p>

<p>it is not an unheard of occurrence with people food, too. if this concerns you, i urge you to do a little research on the subject. prepare to be surprised, and probably much less trusting of your average factory farmed grocery store meat.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is what I first thought, it&#39;s from horse meat. But then someone pointed out livestock is not put down with drugs. They are shot/electrocuted or beheaded. They are not going to waster time &amp; money euthanizing livestock. Then it hit me, it has to be dog or cat meat. They are the only animals that are put down with this drug. </p>

<p>Contaminated ground water is a huge problem. I am in a semi rural environment with minor farming in the area. Very little toxin build up here. Mind you every inch has been clear cut at one point or another over the last 100 years. Some multiple times.</p>
