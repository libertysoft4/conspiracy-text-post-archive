<p>It has never sat right with me that the far-and-away worst shooting in American history is the line exception to the media&#39;s narrative.  What usually takes a full week to exhaust itself in the typical news cycle was over in a couple days, as if there were a conscious decision for everybody to stop talking about it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, there&#39;s that argument that those would also significantly decrease with stricter gun regulations. You know, since after say trying to cut open your wrist, you can still be saved and treated. A shot to the head is a lot more likely to be fatal. And there are a lot of suicides. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s an article (coincidentally released about after the Vegas shooting), that features a study about how particularly suicides dropped after stricter gun regulations were implemented in Australia, while also stating that a decrease in guns and suicides can&#39;t be linked that easily. Which is what it&#39;d call pretty fair journalism. </p>

<p>An argument not backed by data is useless.  Suicide is the 10th leading cause of death in America..  around 45k a year.  Only 22k a year are committed with firearms,  I think those assumptions are incredibly misguided.</p>

<p>Because the majority of suicides happen in the 55+ age group.  Guns clearly have nothing to do with it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I posted the article because it has data suggesting that there is a correlation between guns and suicides. But you&#39;re right maybe I should&#39;ve posted more data: </p>

<p>So first off, suicide by firearm is the 10th leading cause of death in the US, true. 22k is twice as much as gun related homicides, making suicides with a firearm the #1 gun related cause of death in the US. We should do something about that, because the other top 9 causes are sickness or accidents, this is the only willfully inflicted cause of death in the top 10. (Suicides btw are also the second most cause of death for age groups 10-34: <a href="https://www.sprc.org/scope/age">https://www.sprc.org/scope/age</a>)</p>

<p>Here&#39;s and article by the Harvard public health magazine, which incorporates some more data on the relationship between guns and suicides: <a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/magazine/guns-and-suicide/">https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/magazine/guns-and-suicide/</a>
One of the professors says what I wanted to say, only way better: “Studies show that most attempters act on impulse, in moments of panic or despair. Once the acute feelings ease, 90 percent do not go on to die by suicide. But few can survive a gun blast.” </p>

<p>It&#39;s not that a gun is the root cause of what kills these people. It&#39;s just so damn easy to actually kill yourself with one. </p>

<p>A suicide attempt is a lot more likely to succeed with a firearm than it is with all other methods, the fatality rate is about 80%: <a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/means-matter/means-matter/case-fatality/">https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/means-matter/means-matter/case-fatality/</a></p>

<p>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a coincidence suicide by firearm is somewhere steady between 35 and 60 percent of all methods of suicide (depending on age and gender): <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db241.html">https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db241.html</a></p>

<p>Tl;dr: all I&#39;m trying to say is: if you have a person wanting to kill himself, a gun within reach makes all the difference, and the data backs that up. It&#39;s not the guns fault (duh), clearly there&#39;s a mental health issue here. To assure a decline in suicides, gun regulations (stricter background and mental health checks) would definitely work and prevent a lot of deaths. </p>

<p>However, I don&#39;t get the argument about how most suicides happen in the 55+ age group and therefore guns have nothing to do with it. </p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_sovereign_states_by_suicide_rate">Wrong</a>.  Suicide rate is not at all correlated to gun ownership or gun availability rate.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Those are not <em>impulsive</em> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_in_South_Korea">suicides</a>,  as opposed to the other most common category:  Young Men between 15 and 20.  And again,  there&#39;s no evidence to suggest that gun ownership will change anything for that group..  especially considering:  over half of them can&#39;t own a gun legally anyways.</p>

    <p class="byline text-muted mb-0"><a href="javascript:;" class="score"><span class="badge badge-secondary">1</span></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/Spitting_Moose.html">Spitting_Moose</a> 2018-02-23</p>
    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure if this was by accident, but you linked a Wikipedia article to the suicides in South Korea, which specifically pins the high suicide rate in the elderly on socio-economic problems of South Korea. Not the US. </p>

<p>However, my argument still stands: You&#39;re still a lot more likely to succeed when a gun is around. No matter is impulsive or not. Plus for age groups in which impulsive suicide is most common, having a gun in the house is definitely more lethal. Let me back that up with some data:</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure owning a gun or not does the difference, at least not for males: 
&quot;State-level firearm ownership was associated with an increase in both male and female firearm-related suicide rates and with a decrease in nonfirearm-related suicide rates. Higher gun ownership was associated with higher suicide rates by any means among male, but not among female, persons.&quot; - <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4984734/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4984734/</a></p>

<p>Furthermore, this paper specifically mentions the heightened rate of suicide in homes where a gun is owned (which stands in contrast to your suggestion about age playing a role in this): 
&quot;[it] found in both crude and multivariate analyses, among men and women and in every age group, that states with higher rates of household gun ownership had higher rates of firearm suicide and overall suicide.&quot;
- <a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev-publhealth-031811-124636?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;amp;rfr_id=ori%3Arid%3Acrossref.org&amp;amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%3Dpubmed&amp;amp;#_i10">https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev-publhealth-031811-124636?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;amp;rfr_id=ori%3Arid%3Acrossref.org&amp;amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%3Dpubmed&amp;amp;#_i10</a></p>

<p>So these are two scientific sources correlating gun ownership or prevalence to a higher rate of suicide. As shown, guns are the most lethal means of suicide (80%), they&#39;re used in almost 50% percent of all suicides, gun ownership and suicide rates correlate and higher rates of household gun ownership have higher rates of suicides involving a gun plus higher rates of suicides in total. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>South Korea has a suicide rate that is much higher than the US,  but they have an exceptionally low level of gun ownership and availability.  I was trying to make several points at once.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, this paper specifically mentions the heightened rate of suicide in homes where a gun is owned (which stands in contrast to your suggestion about age playing a role in this):</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Except that if you go to their <a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev-publhealth-031811-124636?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;amp;rfr_id=ori%3Arid%3Acrossref.org&amp;amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%3Dpubmed&amp;amp;#">sources</a>,  age <em>absolutely</em> plays a role in this, emphasis mine:  &quot;Three additional findings from the case-control studies are notable. First, the higher risk of suicide in homes with firearms applies not only to the gun owner but also to the gun owner&#39;s spouse and <strong>children</strong>; the relative risk of suicide associated with a firearm in the home is <strong>greater for young people</strong>, and greatest for those without known psychopathology. Second, the presence of a firearm in the home, no matter how it is stored, is a risk factor for completed suicide. Third, how household guns are stored matters. One case-control study that focused on the role of firearm storage in suicide risk among younger people found that <strong>adolescent suicide was four times more likely in homes with a loaded, unlocked firearm</strong>, compared with homes where firearms were stored unloaded and locked.&quot;</p>

<p>Again..  the base data suggests there is more than just gun ownership,  but surrounding factors which may not be included in the longitude of the study and there&#39;s a strong component of impulse involved given the data on storage.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>gun ownership and suicide rates correlate</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At a weak level,  and <em>only</em> in the US.  Worldwide suicide data suggests that <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2698248/">societal factors</a> are far more important.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First off: Sorry for the very late reply, and thanks for this great discussion. </p>

<p>I wanted to say that South Korea isn&#39;t the US, but I also mentioned Australia (if I&#39;d know more about either of those culture I&#39;d argue that maybe Australia culture is closer, but I don&#39;t, so I&#39;ll leave it be). Point taken. </p>

<p>However, the point I made about you saying age is not playing a role in this was exactly the one you made. I was criticizing your comment about kids not being able to own a gun anyways. The quote you&#39;re giving talks about heightened likelihood of suicides for kids, and heightened likelihood of dioxides in general if there&#39;s a gun owner in a household, among other things. This is the point I&#39;m trying to make. </p>

<p>You&#39;re definitely right, there are of course other factors playing into this. The well being of society and the individual etc. that would lead up to suicide (I&#39;m ignoring the probably (hopefully) minuscule number of accidental suicides - or people that kill themselves like Terry Kath did, out of sheer idiocy). </p>

<p>But I think we reached some kind of common ground, didn&#39;t we? There&#39;s a heightened possibility of suicides in gun owner households (the extent of which is up for discussion still), but there&#39;s other factors playing into it as well. </p>

<p>I think people freak easily whenever they hear gun control, maybe because of some crass opinions by some people (&quot;let&#39;s take them ALL away!&quot;) or for a million different reasons. However you wanna call it, if there&#39;s a heightened risk, let&#39;s make owning guns safer for everybody. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. They pick and choose which ones to cover most. </p>

<p>Vegas happened at a country music festival. The voting base was Republican/Conservative so doing a media Blitz would have been a waste of time.   And? Las Vegas washes a lot of money and nobody in power there wants a microscope on the town. </p>

<p>However, Florida is a battleground state for conservative values. It also has the Trayvon Martin incident and the Bush hanging chad incident. So it’s a prime place to pump as much money into exploiting the anger and fear of the situation.</p>

<p>Especially with elections 10 months away. </p>

<p>That’s why.</p>

<p>Kids are still carrying .22s and popping gophers and snakes from very young ages in rural areas. I&#39;ve been out with several friends who have kids to hunt coyote or small game and any kid over 5 has their own gun and knows how to shoot.</p>

<p>I&#39;m in my early 30s and us kids would meet up on our bikes with .22s, 410s and 30-30s to go exploring all the time. Many cans, gophers and snakes met their demise during our play. </p>

<p>This continued through high school in the early 2000s but the guns were in our trucks instead of strapped to our bikes.</p>

<p>I know it&#39;s not as common as rural areas are slowly taken over but there&#39;s still plenty of people who grow up with a gun in their hands. </p>

<p>We dusted each other with .22 birdshot now and then, actually dug a pellet out of my leg last year that had been in there this whole time, haha. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You say &quot;that explains a lot&quot;. So excuse me for taking your words at face value...</p>

<p>What&#39;s the reason it goes into your bank? It&#39;s completely and utterly unsourced. It&#39;s purely based on his own political agenda. I&#39;m just trying to prevent misinformation to be interpreted as facts or a source. At least ask him to explain in depth why he came up with this reason if you&#39;re thinking of &quot;adding it to your bank&quot;. </p>

<p>Where do you get the idea from that &quot;nothing was done after vegas&quot;? Can you link me some sources? Because I&#39;ve only really seen it on this sub on some political forums honestly.... which is all just hearsay repeated enough times to make it sound legit. Which is what I&#39;m trying to prevent here.</p>

<p>Be critical.</p>

<p>Not sure why I&#39;m even trying to tbh. This sub is lost anyway. No one is here for anything but confirmation bias these days...</p>

<p>W..why would that make you happy? And who gets his day ruined by a Reddit comment anyway. 
If you&#39;re a critical thinker fine all good. But your comment implied you took everything at face value so I jumped in. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We had a school shooting here in Marshall County, KY a few weeks ago, and it barely registered on the radar nationally.

Why didn’t national media blitz KY and talk to kids?”</p>

The kid used a handgun, not a rifle.<br/>
And I&#39;m not seeing anything identifying the shooter but his age, ie name race or a picture. I see descriptions such as  </p>

<p>Authorities said that the shooter is a 15-year-old boy who is a student at the school.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m going to go out on a limb here and guess it didn&#39;t get national 24/7 coverage because it doesn&#39;t fit MSM&#39;s agenda.</p>

  The manner of death is, at this point, immaterial.  The HUMAN that commits the crime should be the focus. Including his motives and mental health. Not the tool he used.</p>

<p>These victims do want gun legislation and that too is fine. The difference is there weren&#39;t any movements on the left trying to paint the Las Vegas survivors as paid shills or crisis actors for having a dissenting opinion. You may want to ask yourselves about that if you happen to be part of the movements who work to silence dissent in such a way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Two things.</p>

<p>First paddock was an arms dealer in Vegas to sell to a group of ISIS fighter who were in town that weekend for an Islamic gathering. Yet ISIS being ISIS just killed him and opened fire. It was covered up because paddock was selling for the CIA. </p>

<p>I&#39;m glad I could clear that up for you.</p>

<p>Second thing is you are assuming that the families are whiny cunts. Yet this isn&#39;t missing people. This is death people. What is there to whine about? In there official narrative, the murderer is already dead. What more could a family want. This was country music fans, IE super pro gun. So they aren&#39;t going to go down that road.</p>

<p>Well, were both aware of the rumored cia/govt connections, so i think families would be as well especially given the lack of answers.</p>

<p>Ive asked hundreds of times for evidence of anyone being shot, and still havent seen any. There was the one video that came out from the scene with that kid frantically checking pulses and non existent bullet wounds while the lights went out with no emts around, but that was completely staged imo. You can disagree about the validity of that video, but ive seen enough videos and pictures of the scene to convince me nobody was shot there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Personally I believe it was a globalist plot to take our guns away. They figured if they killed a bunch of right wingers, then they would agree to gun control. Yet the globalist huberous doesn&#39;t understand that the core believe every time one of these mass murders happen, is that more people should have guns not less. The globalist will never understand this because they think the public is dumb and can be easily suede in their opinions. Those fucking cunts.</p>

<p>Just like the Valentine mass murder. This time the globalists thought killing kids could change the right wing mind. Yet like always the right responded with, well let&#39;s give teachers guns. The next shooting will be a church. </p>

<p>Anyhow what were we talking about, oh right yeah I saw that video too. But have you seen the <a href="https://youtu.be/JxmEFeKy8aI">sound analysis</a> where he shows the sound of bullets hitting the ground. I agree we have no pictures of bullet holes or bullets. Also that shooting a full auto <a href="https://youtu.be/_mXe9dk77bk">M240</a> at 400 yards and getting any accuracy is an absurd notion.</p>

<p>Yet none of the eye witnesses <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/79nyb3/its_been_less_than_a_month_since_las_vegas">found dead</a> were saying it didn&#39;t happen. They all were saying multiple shooters. Also considering anyone who knows that it was likely a set up, would also know about people dying for speaking up. Thus wouldn&#39;t it stand to reason that people would just let it go rather than chance having a &quot;heart attack&quot;. Not to mention that I&#39;m sure every victims family got money from gofundmes and likely the concert.</p>

<p>At what point do you just move on with life and realize there isn&#39;t much that can be done? Rather than no body died, that is. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know about the gun fire at the other casinos because my friend was at one of them and text me about it when it happened before the news even started talking about it. I thought he was just fucking around at the time. Because we joke a lot so when he said someone was shooting up his casino it seemed like the normal Doom and Gloom we always text each other.</p>

<p>So that one is definitely confirmed in my mind. Now what&#39;s this about some ambulance lined up? I didn&#39;t hear about that one. After it was clear that the whole thing was fucked I stopped watching it to wait for a clearer picture to come out. Which granted still hasn&#39;t happened now 5 months later. While we have a new conspiracy to look at because no one can say where the Valentine murderers body armor went, or even explain how the cops know it was cruz when all reports say the shooter had a mask on. I guess if they found the gun that would be enough. Did they say they found the gun...</p>

<p>I digress, yeah I must admit that I was thinking the same thing. Who could have foreseen the day when actual running into another conspiracy theorist on r/conspiracy would be something to feel joy about. This sub has completely been over run with brainwashed useful idiots to the point that you have to sort comments by controversial to see anyone actually talking about conspiracy while all of the top comments are arguing for the fucking official narrative.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the most frustrating thing imaginable, this used to be a great place. So what are these pictures you were talking about?</p>

<p>Imagine if i said &quot;my friend was raped by bill clinton&quot;, and someone then replied to my comment saying &quot;bullshit&quot;.

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;The Jew is immunized against all dangers: one may call him a scoundrel, parasite, swindler, profiteer, it all runs off him like water off a raincoat. <strong>But call him a Jew and you will be astonished at how he recoils, how injured he is, how he suddenly shrinks back: “I’ve been found out.”</strong></p>

<p>One cannot defend himself against the Jew. He attacks with lightning speed from his position of safety and uses his abilities to crush any attempt at defense.</p>

<p>Quickly he turns the attacker’s charges back on him and the attacker becomes the liar, the troublemaker, the terrorist. Nothing could be more mistaken than to defend oneself. That is just what the Jew wants. He can invent a new lie every day for the enemy to respond to, and the result is that the enemy spends so much time defending himself that he has no time to do what the Jew really fears: to attack. The accused has become the accuser, and loudly he shoves the accuser into the dock. So it always was in the past when a person or a movement fought the Jew.&quot;</p>

<p>Yeah youre right tho, i dont know you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also for most people when you go to school it&#39;s is an every day monotony.  Vegas is a once in a Blue moon time.  A school shooting takes away everyday safety feeling.  Vegas takes away the special night out safety feeling.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah it&#39;s definitely a small percent of people that say those types of things. Just the same as when it happens to a more left leaning crowd that people on the right say similar things. But since this time it was children again, and basicaly nobody will say that children deserve it, it makes it a better one to get behind for anyone looking to push gun control.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Two things.</p>

<p>First paddock was an arms dealer in Vegas to sell to a group of ISIS fighter who were in town that weekend for an Islamic gathering. Yet ISIS being ISIS just killed him and opened fire. It was covered up because paddock was selling for the CIA. </p>

<p>I&#39;m glad I could clear that up for you.</p>

<p>Second thing is you are assuming that the families are whiny cunts. Yet this isn&#39;t missing people. This is death people. What is there to whine about? In there official narrative, the murderer is already dead. What more could a family want. This was country music fans, IE super pro gun. So they aren&#39;t going to go down that road.</p>

<p>What else do you expect them to make a fuss about?</p>
