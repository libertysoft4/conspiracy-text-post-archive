        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Anyone remember a few years ago when Foley (i forget his first name) was &#39;beheaded&#39; by &#39;ISIS&#39; - in what was a very slick video filmed in HD, and in all thse videos the baddies are always wearing orange jumpuits for some reason.</p>

<p>Anyone remember the &#39;sister&#39; being interviewed on a news station, and she was always smirking? She and her husband (?) showed ZERO emotion considering their loved one was killed brutally, and in the background you can see a picture frame fall down.</p>

<p>I believe she was, is a crisis actor. And i believe ISIS was crated by the CIA as another boogeyman for people to be scared of.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>NO way dude.  ISIS is totally real.  First, you take some ultra fundamentalist Muslims and give them social media accounts.  Then, they recruit regular white guys from the West.  Before you know it, they can produce Hollywood-quality films (including CGI).  They even have the ability to take over oil refineries and actually operate them for profit. it&#39;s totally a grassroots movement though</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The craziest thing about that video for me was how they don’t <em>actually</em> show the beheading. Just as they start to cut off his head, the camera fades to black and then fades back in to a head just sitting on the body.</p>

<p>It’s like, you’re trying to tell me that these guys are so ruthless that they’re making beheading videos... but have to decency to censor out the most brutal part of it?? I’ve seen Mexican cartel beheading videos before (well just one, and then never again), and they are absolutely horrifying. If you’re ISIS and trying to really send a message, then why cut out the most gruesome and terrifying aspect of a beheading?</p>

<p>Made no sense to me at the time, and still doesn’t. That looked like something Hollywood would do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You want your mind blown? Look into the 1st beheading back after 9/11. 
I can&#39;t remember his name right now, but he was a &quot;student&quot; at Oklahoma. He was caught on campus a few times late at night and one of the hijackers used his login on a library computer. What are the odds? A Dean or president of the u iversity at the time was also former CIA or something like that. 
So this guy ends up as a contractor in Iraq working on cell towers.... During the early stages of the war.</p>

<p>So what it seemed like was this kid was picked up as a CIA assest in the US then was sent to Iraq to die because he knew too much. Or they needed another ghost. </p>

Her brother dies brutally by beheading, and she talks in the interview as thoigh shes talking about what she did on the weekend. </p>

<p>And the video itself, Foley showed zero emotion for someone about to be beheaded and did not fight at all for his life.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting experience I had about 5-6 years ago, working in a practical special FX shop, where we made animatronics, prosthetics, wounds, fake bodies, etc. mostly for movies and tv, but the owner did confidential contracts for one of the alphabet agencies. He was very very good at what he did. He could transform a person into a different person entirely... one of his specialties was severed heads that looked exactly like real heads. Pretty sure it was the CIA he did projects for—he was very proud of it and would allude to it often but never say it outright. So there would be days where the shop was closed to anyone by him or the bonded team working with him. The only thing I ever saw was the mold for a prosthetic nose that he’d made for someone. </p>

<p>Definitely not saying that he made the head for the video, just saying that I’ve seen it done with my own eyes and I’ve also seen special FX specialists working for government agencies.</p>
