        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>These tragedies strike and both Political parties are trying to use it to further their own agendas. Right-wings using conspiracy theories and giving them a bad name, which now every conspiracy theory is branded &#39;right-wing propaganda&#39; and left-wing using these tragedies to further their own agendas, calling everyone who doesn&#39;t believe the &#39;official narrative&#39; a &#39;right-wing&#39;, &#39;tin foil hat crazy&#39; e.t.c </p>

<p>Politics aside, is anyone actually interested in the truth? is anyone actually interested in helping make the world a better place? Our communities? </p>

<p>A message to BOTH sides. </p>

<p>Dear left-wing, don&#39;t take everything at face value. Y&#39;all tend to mock Christianity or any other Religion for brainwashing its followers, yet you are equally, if not more, brainwashed. Y&#39;all are willing to believe everything as long as it fits your side&#39;s narrative and the agenda they want to push. USE YOUR CRITICAL THINKING for crying out loud. Y&#39;all have brains. USE THEM. If something smells fishy, regardless of its origin(right-wing, left-wing), try and seek for the TRUTH. If you are a left-wing and you honestly believe there is NOTHING fishy about this whole thing, then I&#39;m sorry but you are not &#39;woke&#39;. </p>

<p>Dear right wing, GUNS SHOULD BE ILLEGAL. How hard is that for y&#39;all to understand? Sure, the left is pushing for said agenda against guns. Are they in the wrong for that? Y&#39;all can&#39;t honestly believe that GUNS are the solution. They are not. They are the PROBLEM. One of the problems, to put it better. Y&#39;all love to mock war-lover Hillary, but at the same time, y&#39;all want your guns. Also, stop using conspiracy theorists to also further your own agendas. Trump is an idiot. He is vile and he is literally the worst person to represent MEN, because he gives us a bad name. If you idolize him, then I&#39;m sorry but you need to sort your lives out. </p>
