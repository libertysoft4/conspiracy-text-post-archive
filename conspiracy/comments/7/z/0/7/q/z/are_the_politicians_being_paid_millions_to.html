        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>With all of this talk about whether or not the Florida teenagers are being paid to speak for gun regulations, I think it&#39;s impotent to discuss who else might be getting paid to advocate for a particular side. <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/orgs/summary.php?id=d000000082">This controversial site</a> claims that National Rifle Association paid upwards of <strong><em>$54,000,000 dollars</em></strong> to politicians and political organizations to get them to support gun deregulation.  <strong>$54 million</strong> is basically an <em>unbelievably</em> high number (where would they get that kinda money?). </p>

<p>But, putting aside the discussion about the kids getting paid, is there any nugget of truth to the idea that the politicians are getting paid to support gun deregulation?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, that&#39;s what I&#39;m wondering. It&#39;s a chicken in the egg problem. Do they only support politicians that already would be for gun deregulation, or are they supporting politicians to <em>make</em> them for gun deregulation?

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, a trained force of volunteers, but the whole amendment was written with that term because some members of Congress were opposed to a standing army. The point being that individuals with training could own guns, not just the military. It didn&#39;t mean every person could own guns. There were obligations to the militia, and the well regulated part was included to insure the militia members were trained, to avoid the assistance of European armies, again. </p>

<p>Not without military grade weapons. The Taliban wouldn&#39;t be a thing if they didn&#39;t get military hardware. You need more than AR15&#39;s to wage an effective guerrilla war against a modern army. You need something to take down air supplies with (like shoulder-fired Stingers) and you need to disrupt convoys with military grade mines and other things we can&#39;t buy.</p>

<p>If the goal is to fight the US military, even in just a guerilla war, we need more than .223 rifle cartridges.</p>

<p>Like who? Who waged war (guerrilla or otherwise) against the US and did &#39;alright&#39; without any military grade hardware? I am unaware of a single war like that. From the Taliban to the Viet Cong to ISIS, they all had much better and more deadly equipment than what you can buy in the US. And, they <em>needed</em> it. At least, that&#39;s my understanding. Do you have a counterexample?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And if it actually comes to that, there are no shortage of black market arms in America.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I thought the point was we could get what we need legally. If you&#39;re saying we should be getting things illegally, you&#39;re not helping the case for the second amendment. You&#39;re saying its not needed, so it&#39;s moot if we should restrict it or not.</p>

<p>Here I thought we were arguing about the viability of guerilla warfare.  Obviously, once it comes to that laws are the least of people&#39;s concerns.  And while I&#39;m willing to admit that the people&#39;s chance against America&#39;s army aren&#39;t great, they&#39;re still a lot better if half the populace is armed than if 5% are. </p>

<p>Peasants weren&#39;t allowed to have longbows in most of Europe for a few hundred years because the rulers didn&#39;t want them fighting their enforcers.  The peasants never had a chance in open warfare, but nothing stopped them from firing a few dozen arrows at some officials then fading away.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viet_Cong_and_Vietnam_People%27s_Army_logistics_and_equipment">Yes they did.</a> Even the more dramatic tales you hear about (a women pretending a bomb is her baby and blowing everyone up) involve <strong>military</strong> grade explosives.</p>

<p>Knights aren&#39;t jets. Tanks aren&#39;t wagons. And &quot;fading away&quot; takes on a completely different meaning when you&#39;re talking about nuclear missiles.</p>

<p>To wage a guerrilla war you might not need a aircraft carrier, but you better have something that can blow up the jets coming off of it. You might not need tanks, but you need something that can destroy one. And, its not as easy as in the WW2 movies. Now-a-days tanks have evolved so throwing tar on the scope and lighting fire to the outside doesn&#39;t do anything.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, agree to disagree I guess.  I think you should read more about the Vietnam war.  Some of the Viet Cong certainly had military grade weapons, but most of them were peasants with small arms and maybe some explosives.  My wife&#39;s grandfather spent 4 years setting traps in the Jungle, and never even fired his rifle in anger.</p>

<p>Also, look up what the Finnish snipers did to the Russian armored corps.</p>

<p>Put your anecdotal evidence to the side for a sec and read the wiki page I linked. The Viet Cong couldn&#39;t have driven us off with what you can buy at the gun shop.</p>
