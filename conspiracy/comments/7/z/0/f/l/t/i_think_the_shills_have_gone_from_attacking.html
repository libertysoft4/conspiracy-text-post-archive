So many things at 0 and are obvious manipulation. They want it to seem that things are being accepted by conspiracy thinkers by sheer volume like so many people are posting this then it must be true... You have to be patient and very responsible with the information being spammed. Keep your mind strong. Entertain all thoughts and info but be careful on settling. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is this a recent phenomenon? I&#39;ve noticed it heavily in the last month and I&#39;ve never seen that kind of thing happen in discussions here. Usually there is some difference of opinion but these people I&#39;m referring to usually dominate the top comment threads with 3-4 times the upvotes even though they express views that discount everything this sub is about. Of course there have always been people attempting to shape discussion here but I&#39;m talking about the specific phenomenon of a majority of top comments to be against the OP&#39;s position while at the same time being upvoted 3-4 times higher than any other comments in the discussion. I guess it could be an influx of users with a different mindset but what are the odds that we would see a native influx of users, all sharing a similar mindset, but one that is against the sentiment of this sub? Then what lead them here in the first place?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Would like to point out I got -37 on this comment and the person I was responding to or was pulling the good ol occams razor doubt  got +447</p>

<p>Narcisstical Psychopaths,</p>

<p>I understand your point of view 100% I would have agreed with it a year ago,</p>

<p>It isnt any individual restaurant, it isnt even specifically restaurants, it isnt even specifically body disposal.</p>

<p>Its front businesses to launder money for organized pedophilic activities</p>

<p>Restaurants have a lot more wiggle room when it comes to their expenses and profits compared to other businesses.</p>

<p>Im not saying the pizza sauce is made with blood, It may be that their is no human in any of their food or even in any of the similar locations such as comet.</p>

<p>But the idea is that these locations are legal front companies operating as covers for illicit human trafficking organizations that are multi-national in nature.</p>

<p>The previous sentence is about as cut and dry as it gets, their ARE horrible criminals operating out of legal businesses to launder their illicit gains regardless if this specific restaurant is one of them (high chance it is) the previous statement is true.</p>

<p>The type of people invovled in these type of operations would be extremely high functioning but extremely mentally unwell.</p>

<p>They would likely be millionaires and cocky that they are able to operate in plain site, and a narciscists in this type of field would likely put little in your face &quot;clues&quot; such as discussed in the OP as it would give them a kind of power high over all the &quot;sheep&quot; who they are able to trick.</p>

I stated in the post I am a leftist but despise those types... and sure enough it ended up hidden because it was so downvoted.
