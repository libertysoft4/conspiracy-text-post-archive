<p>Many of the businesses there were open late, on off hours, and especially on weekends - including a restaurant at the top one of the towers.  They would lose incalculable amounts of money by shutting down the power to the twin towers for 36 hours!  This assertion is completely ridiculous to anyone who has lived in the area.</p>

<p>That&#39;s not proof. You worked down the street from there so you know for sure? What the heck is this?</p>

<p>Where you actually in the building that weekend or not? Because there are witnesses who were and they state the power was turned off. I&#39;ll take witnesses over someone who was down the street, any day of the week</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Police swarmed St. Rose of Lima School on Church Hill Road in Newtown Friday afternoon, hours after the shooting at nearby Sandy Hook Elementary School.</p>

<p>Neil Curry, whose 11-year-old son Kevin is in fifth grade at the school, said the school was put in lock down three times during the day. Curry said a person was found “lurking” outside a kindergarten class room. Later, an “agitated” person was reported inside the St. Rose of Lima Church near the school.</p>

<p>At 3 p.m., a police officer in charge of the scene said everything was under control.</p>

<p>Just like how the ATF used Waco and Fast and Furious to show that they still are needed. Truly sick.</p>

<p>Can anyone name one of our agencies that is going what they are supposed to? </p>

<p>FDA is not protected us from Big Pharma, Monsanto etc. </p>

<p>DEA still has marijuana as a schedule 1 substance even though it is being used for medical purposes in over half the country.</p>

<p>NSA is spying on us.</p>

<p>CIA\FBI appears to using mentally ill people to stage attacks\ turn a blind eye when they know it will happen.</p>

<p>I personally think that agencies have ran thier course. They were nessisary at one time but now it looks like a way to circumnavigation the people and our alleged representative.</p>

<p>That bizarre little narrative is so damned consistent we could really say that it sets all those crimes apart from just about any and all others.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not like first responders aren&#39;t schooled or don&#39;t know how to co-operate or don&#39;t do practice runs and training drills when they aren&#39;t dealing with the real thing. </p>

<p>What is different is that since 9/11 tons of money and national plans have been steadily rolled-out hiring tons of people and even disrupting all kinds of normal activities to stage these all these fake events.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Cruz quite literally knew the drill when it came to active shooters and understood that the lockdown procedure would go into effect the moment gunshots were heard. He certainly did not want to find himself wandering suddenly deserted hallways, trying to force his way through locked doors.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So Cruz seems to have hatched a two-part scheme to thwart the well-rehearsed lockdown plan.</p>

<p>He began by waiting until just five minutes before the 2:35 p.m. dismissal time.</p>

<p>He then pulled a fire alarm.</p>

<p>The timing likely made it more difficult for the school to order and maintain a complete lockdown. He was able to kill 12 inside the school, along with another two just outside and one on the street. Three more died in the hospital.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s in the Draco handbook to complete a simulation you must have tested the simulation in a similar setting before carrying out an action as commanded by THərˈtēn. It&#39;s easy to see how recent news translates into the reptilian plan of human hybridization between the attack in florida, Nikki Haley going to the middle east and even the olympic games, which at this point is just a full out competition between variations on human-extraterrestrial hybrids. </p>

<p>In the context of the mass shooting, bullets are used to collect large samples of dna. The surface is coated with a nano-fiber membrane capable of analysis and transmission of nucleic information but it can only do so by turning kinetic energy into electrical impulses after being fired from a weapon. (You can see why a portion of the population wants more guns = more DNA samples) This data is then stored locally on the planet between trips from emissaries from Draco. </p>
