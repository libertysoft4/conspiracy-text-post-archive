<p>AR-15’s fire a .223 round which is smaller and lighter and does less damage.</p>

<p>If these school shooters were going for substance over style, they would carry one of these.</p>

<p>In fact, most handguns over 9mm (the most popular) have a much bigger caliber than the AR-15 and they’re easier to conceal. The Glock 9 has a 17 round capacity. </p>

<p>I just don’t see how banning AR-15’s is going to do a damn bit of good. They’re are plenty of deadlier guns on the market.</p>

<p>Stating that “we don’t care if hunters have guns” is disingenuous. First they take the “assault weapons” and then they come for the rest.</p>

<p>What a strawman. I&#39;m not a &#39;downvotin democrat&#39; , but be real with your argument. The majority of the argument wants restrictions on certain weapons and how they are obtained, not an outright ban on all guns. Claiming the argument is &#39;ban all guns&#39; is the same as the &#39;downvoting democrats&#39; claiming the other side wants AR-15s and handguns in the hands of every schoolchild. Both are strawmen arguments that only represent a very small (if any) fraction of the debate on either side.</p>

<p>Nobody has a problem with you having a hunting rifle or a shotgun. They&#39;re driven by fear and fueled by decades of insane right wing rhetoric.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>US Liberals CLAIM they want to ban assault rifles but they had 8 years of their savior Obama &amp; all he did is make them more powerful.  Their alleged support of banning assault rifles is nothing more than pandering to their uneducated supporters - <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2018/02/20/trump-signs-a-memo-telling-attorney-general-sessions-to-ban-devices-that-turn-weapons-into-machine-guns.html">https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2018/02/20/trump-signs-a-memo-telling-attorney-general-sessions-to-ban-devices-that-turn-weapons-into-machine-guns.html</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Stop? The Russians? Who thinks worse of Russians? Me or you? Do you really think the Russians are just geared up any moment to invade us? </p>

<p>Have you even seen our president get all chipper and happy to talk about Putin? &quot;He called me a genius&quot;. It&#39;s a &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; that Donald Trump is a Russian stooge, which is easily not true if there is no kompromat from his visits to Russia. One thing we don&#39;t want is a liberal conspiracy theorizing, amirite? Or else they might put an innocent man into prison for treason. They only doing it for revenge because the right literally calls everything treason like McCarthy were all of their last names.</p>

<p>I notice you guys like to say this... I don&#39;t think that&#39;s true. I think that&#39;s another meme or a &quot;keep repeating something it becomes true&quot;. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The all guns part comes from the actual bills they try to pass banning assault rifles. Theres been quite a few different ones, but the ones that get weight and get close usually start off by redefining &quot;assault gun&quot; as any gun(pistol or not) that discharges the shell of the bullet fired and loads the next round. Which pretty much excludes only musket rifles, and manual load shotguns. Hell that definition includes bb guns.</p>
