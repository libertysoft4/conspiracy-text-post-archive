        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Since the events in Florida, I&#39;ve kept asking myself, why was the focus on the victims? Why was there so much disinfo flying around regarding the VICTIMS?</p>

<p>Highchool kids were somehow taking taking the brunt of the blame over something that just happened to them. They were/are the victims. Kids who saw their teachers and peers fall injured or even worse dead where suddenly the target again.</p>

<p>Theories flew rather quickly, first to wrongly identify the shooter, then to accuse the students of being actors, then to try to seemingly blame the victims of this tragedy as being in on it.</p>

<p>It is honestly very upsetting.</p>

<p>We should be focusing on the provable issues that lead up to this event:</p>

<p>*The FBI&#39;s &quot;incompetency&quot; and inaction even when given credible information.</p>

<p>*The mental health aspect and the side effects of psycho-pharmaceuticals </p>

<p>*The failure of federal background checks to identify the perps violent behavior that lead to multiple expulsions from school</p>

<p>*The radicalization of the perp through internet propaganda.</p>

<p>The list goes on.</p>

<p>What should have NEVER been on the list was blaming the victims.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not asking you to not question things, I&#39;m asking you to do your due diligence and find the truth. I&#39;m asking you to be civil and strive to better this community.</p>

<p>I hope you all understand the reach and influence this community really has.</p>

<p>If you want to have a conversation with me about this I&#39;ll be here.</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Edit: Seems like I have upset some people here enough that my whole post history is once again being downvoted. Comments with with 5 seconds in already at 0 or -1.</p>

<p>Even if that&#39;s the case, they still have the right to talk about it. They just  went through hell, why not listen to their stories and have a conversation about it?</p>

<p>That&#39;s VERY misinformed. These are their formative years. What happens here affects them for the rest of their lives. Adults who go through similar situations in war, who are TRAINED to expect this still come out damaged.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was not at all saying that they don&#39;t have a right to or shouldn&#39;t speak on their stories, what I&#39;m saying is that it seems to be they are being coached and driven into pushing a narrative moreso than to share their tragedy with others. Rather than that they won&#39;t feel traumatized from this event, what I intended to propose is that everyone is capable of handling tragedy differently, and just because they are able to go on TV without breaking down does not, to me, scream that they are crisis actors, but moreso that they are being driven to push a narrative while given the illusion that they are on Mainstream Media to share their tragedy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Every time something tragic occurs the race is on to claim it was faked, a hoax, or false-flag.</p>

<p>Too many people have no interest in truth, they just want some sort of scenario where they are more ‘woke’ than other people.</p>

<p>You can find all the things you mentioned being discussed outside of r/conspiracy, so those points are no longer good enough for them. It’s all too “mainstream.”</p>

<p>Infowars and other fake news sites, YouTube “conspiracy theorists,” and others who make their living from shilling this crap make it blow up; and they’re the reason why the discourse here is complete shit at the moment (there was some decent discussion here before the propaganda and fake stories got going). But I still saw r/conspiracy users rushing to cry “False flag!” from the very start. It’s damn sad.</p>

<p>You&#39;re not going to stop anyone from posing as a member of a &quot;conspiracy&quot; community and then acting awfully simply to discredit everyone and any theories being debated (especially if there is any truth involved). Imagine the headlines &quot;victim further traumatised by death-threats from conspiracy community&quot;. It&#39;s a very simple and effective tactic. Appealing to people&#39;s good nature wont do anything to stop dis-info attacks.  I have a feeling we will be seeing more headlines discrediting conspiracy theorists as deranged in the near future.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I completely agree with your opinion.
I think what is happening after these mass shootings are people thinking...
Here we go again... another shooting which always has been worse then the last one.
Say what you will but I am certain Sandy Hook, Boston, and pulse were totally staged events. I say this after watching hours upon hours of video enate things just don&#39;t add up.
You have crisis actors at multiple events, narratives which make zero sense and people calling for gun reform before the blood is even dry.

    <div class="md"><p>All mass shootings in the media are fake, simple as that. There isn’t any evidence for a single one of them being real.</p>

<p>As for Hogg, I suspect he and his cohorts just fit the bill for this event. Their views and his enthusiasm for the media were highly compatible with the intended narrative, so he was thrust into the spotlight. A tool, a useful idiot, but probably not fully aware of the fact he is being played like a fiddle.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You’re doubting nearly every school shooting as far as I can tell. That means all the victims, the police officers, local government, teachers in each instance, oh and I imagine in your mind the federal government is also involved, and that would bring in the various security services, plus whatever cabal/secret society you think is orchestrating and planning these events - they’re all lying. That’s easily tens of thousands of people.</p>

<p>Lots of kids have died because of this. I know that’s hard to accept, but they did. You’re twisting reality to fit the idea that they didn’t, but the truth is the world is chaotic and doesn’t make sense a lot of the time. You need to learn to deal with that because what you’re doing is disrespectful to the victims and their families.</p>

<p>You’re doubting nearly every school shooting as far as I can tell.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I doubt any that get widespread co-ordinated media coverage, and which fit neatly into the average news cycle, where the perpetrator is caught and the crime is nearly wrapped up within a matter of hours.</p>

<p>Real shootings don’t get that kind of blanket media coverage, because real mass shootings are incredibly rare and the motivation behind each one is different and complex.</p>

<p>What I’m really saying is that the press is essentially a propaganda tool of the people in charge of these events, and anything you see or read about in mainstream media is not to be trusted at all. Editors have no need to double check facts provided by their “securedrop” 4am feeds, or accredited AP photographers, or news wires. They are all accustomed to towing the line as far as national news stories are concerned.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That means [...] they’re all lying.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, it doesn’t. It’s absurd to suggest everyone is in on each one of these events. It’s also pure speculation to attempt to guess who is and who isn’t, but it’s pretty easy to spot fakes on camera. Victims who can’t cry tears while sobbing away, families who are all smiles and forgiveness within hours of the event taking place, police officers being fed lines off camera, coroners dramatically describing “this magnificent... <em>thing</em>” (hello Wayne Carver).</p>

<p>A large majority of shootings seem to coincide with drills of one kind or another. This is obviously no accident and provides the perfect cover story for having all the resources in place to stage the event.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Lots of kids have died because of this. I know that’s hard to accept, but they did. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>There’s no evidence for that statement.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think you know what evidence actually is. Eyewitness accounts, videos, fucking <em>autopsy reports</em>, death certificates etc. I imagine none of these count as evidence to you because it was the deep state or some other ridiculous shit.</p>

<p>I’ve already outlined what I think, which is that pretty much all mass media spectacles are faked. It therefore follows that all “evidence” presented <em>must</em> be faked too.</p>

<p>It’s not only plausible, it’s probable and I am willing to bet neither you nor anybody else reding this has ever followed up on a single piece of evidence to determine its authenticity.</p>

<p>This then begs the question: why are you convinced that the “evidence” presented is genuine? Do you think it would be especially hard for an organisation capable of pulling off a deception on this scale to also fake those certificates, or to place actors to lie on camera, or to stitch clips of people who thought they were doing a drill into other footage, or to use the world’s shittiest cameraphone footage to show brief glimpses of Hollywood gore?</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t follow just because you <em>think</em> it. The evidence for it being legitimate far outweighs any supposed holes in the &quot;story&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

<p>It follows because <em>there is a clear  and logical explanation</em> for all these events. Whether you agree with this explanation is neither here nor there.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The evidence for it being legitimate far outweighs any supposed holes in the &quot;story&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have never seen even <strong>one piece of evidence</strong> that cannot be attributed more easily to lies and media fakery than to the purported event. Not one.</p>

<p>If you think you have something compelling to share, from this event or any other, please do so. It would be even better if you could explain why it convinces you. I’m certainly open minded enough to be persuaded by extraordinarily compelling evidence.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&#39;t believe this organisation exists, because there&#39;s no evidence to suggest it does</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What evidence would you expect to find? Such an organisation must necessarily be able to operate in total secrecy.</p>

<p>Do you agree there are large and powerful organisations that have the capabilities to operate in whole or in part in secrecy? If so, is it really such a stretch to extrapolate that notion to one of the <em>largest</em> and <em>most powerful</em> organisations that has ever existed?</p>

<p>In any case, the totality of evidence of fakery at each and every one of these media circus events is more than enough reason to consider it a possibility.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>no push from either side to ban guns - so no motive.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I didn’t speculate on a motive or a specific agenda, so why are you doing it?</p>

<p>So you automatically discount all evidence as being manufactured by some shadow-y organisation that has seemingly unlimited power and influence. Right.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you think you have something compelling to share, from this event or any other, please do so.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;d discount any piece of evidence as being faked by the deep state, there&#39;s nothing in the world that would convince you because in your mind there&#39;s nothing this organisation isn&#39;t capable of. </p>

<p>If everything can be explained away as some big conspiracy then you&#39;ll twist anything and everything to fit that agenda. Hopefully one day you&#39;ll see the fundamental flaw in your logic. I&#39;m done arguing, I&#39;ve made my point pretty clearly and mine is backed up with actual <em>evidence</em>, yours is backed up with stories you&#39;ve invented to fit the conclusion you came to before-hand.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There’s a big difference though. You seem to be asserting that the event actually happened which one would think could easily be proven... unless for some reason all evidence that constitutes irrefutable proof is being deliberately withheld?</p>

<p>An allegedly uncontrolled and spontaneous event of this scale would surely result in some evidence of that quality leaking, no matter how tight the controls put in place after the fact. Would t you agree?</p>

<p>On the other hand, an event controlled from start to finish and designed to paint a certain picture would only be supported by ambiguous snippets of “evidence” tossed deliberately into the public domain, specifically to prop up whatever narrative is being spun. No compelling evidence would ever come forwards later because no such evidence exists.</p>

<p>Which scenario do we actually see at Parkland and at all other media circus events of that nature?</p>

<p>I’m asserting that Parkland didn’t happen as described by the media, and that all we <em>have</em> seen is a co-ordinated staged production. I can’t prove the event didn’t happen, but then again, I don’t need to when there is a total absence of physical evidence to prove that it <em>did</em>.</p>

<p>Can you see why this admittedly cynical and skeptical argument always has its place in the absence of compelling and extraordinary evidence to the contrary?</p>

<p>The strategy was this: 
Use the children because adults cannot ARGUE BACK.  The optics are terrible.  </p>

<p>Could you imagine in that CNN hour of hate, if one of the adults argued back vs a small teenage victim?  I mean those kids said some completely immoral things, and the adults had to take it in stride.  This was just a political strategy in favor of dismantling the Second Amendment.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem is you are forced to talk about the kids because they’re being plastered on every news station 24/7, and most a talking about issues that they don’t fully understand. And on top of that the media was very quick to jump on the conspiracy crowd claiming something was wrong, again forcing the hands of those talking about the kids to double down.</p>

<p>Also, I would like to point out that no one is really talking about the “kids” but more specifically about a “few kids”. Those few being talked about have actively thrust themselves into the limelight, so let me ask you this: do you disagree with other people in the political limelight being talked about? Are you bothered by the scandals surrounding Donald Trump? What about the fall out of the Rachel Dolezal situation a few years back, did that irk you? Or anything about Hillary Clinton’s health during the election? Face it, when people are in the spotlight in a political atmosphere they are criticized and typically it’s personal. It doesn’t change that they are 17-18 (which is typically the age where one is “legally” an adult). And yes, the atmosphere surrounding these “kids” <em>is</em> political because of the talking points <em>they</em> chose to discuss. </p>

<p>I’m sorry that this is probably against the grain but that’s part of the game and this is the way it’s been since Nixon. Literally no person involved in the political scene is safe from criticism especially when they volunteer their time to go on almost any news outlet, and their talking points quite literally go against the second fundamental pillar that this country was built on. That’s just the reality of the world we live in, and I’m sorry for that.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the tldr of what I wanted to write:
False flags are sloppy on purpose to agitate the people, divide them in camps and incite hatred (conspiracy theorist, sheeple, truther, etc) and also to lower trust in the government as well as the media. I think that&#39;s all part of the plan. That&#39;s why they regurgitate older hoaxes and will pick up &#39;truther&#39; arguments and talking points as well as disseminate disinformation to obfuscate public perception. I think it&#39;s part of the planned slow destabilisation of the only white country with a large armed christian population. </p>

<p>None of them have been interviewed during another disaster, David Hogg was interviewed cause his mate got into a feud with a lifeguard over putting a bogie board on top of a bin on the beach, or is that how they train crisis actors? </p>

<p>Having a father that is a retired FBI agent is hardly a teenage kid having connections to a federal agency, not only are there thousands of people working for the FBI, but even more than that that use to work for the FBI.</p>

<p>So yeah your &quot;facts&quot; hold up if you don&#39;t apply any realistic critical thinking to them, but that&#39;s not quite what a conspiracy subreddit is suppose to be about. </p>

<p>Go ahead and question everything, but at least have solid proof and don&#39;t harass anyone.</p>

<p>That sub is depressing reading.</p>

<p>You&#39;re not going to stop anyone from posing as a member of a &quot;conspiracy&quot; community and then acting awfully simply to discredit everyone and any theories being debated (especially if there is any truth involved). Imagine the headlines &quot;victim further traumatised by death-threats from conspiracy community&quot;. It&#39;s a very simple and effective tactic. Appealing to people&#39;s good nature wont do anything to stop dis-info attacks.  I have a feeling we will be seeing more headlines discrediting conspiracy theorists as deranged in the near future.</p>
