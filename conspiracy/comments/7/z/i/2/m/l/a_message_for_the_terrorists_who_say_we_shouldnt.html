<p>Listen, you fantastically retarded motherfuckers. I’m going to try to explain this so that you can understand it.</p>

<p>You cannot control an entire country and its people with tanks, jets, battleships and drones or any of these things that you so stupidly believe trumps citizen ownership of firearms.</p>

<p>A fighter jet, tank, drone, battleship or whatever cannot stand on street corners and enforce “no assembly” edicts. A fighter jet cannot kick down your door at 3AM and search your house for contraband.</p>

<p>None of these things can maintain the needed police state to completely subjugate and enslave the people of a nation. Those weapons are for decimating, flattening and glassing large areas and many people at once and fighting other state militaries. The government does not want to kill all of its people and blow up its own infrastructure. These are the very things they need to be tyrannical assholes in the first place. If they decided to turn everything outside of Washington D.C. into glowing green glass they would be the absolute rulers of a big, worthless, radioactive pile of shit.</p>

<p>Police are needed to maintain a police state, boots on the ground. And no matter how many police you have on the ground they will always be vastly outnumbered by civilians which is why in a police state it is vital that your police have automatic weapons while the people have nothing but their limp dicks.</p>

<p>BUT when every random pedestrian could have a Glock in their waistband and every random homeowner an AR-15 all of that goes out the fucking window because now the police are out numbered and face the reality of bullets coming back at them.</p>

<p>If you want living breathing, examples of this look at every single insurgency that the U.S. military has tried to destroy. They’re all still rolling with nothing but AK-47s, pick up trucks and improvised explosives because these big scary military monsters you keep alluding to are all but fucking useless for dealing with them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is true that an average household could not prevent a warrant from being enacted. </p>

<p>Ruby Ridge, Waco... the list goes on. </p>

<p>Here in Canuckistan there are laws against even fortifying your residence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look into Cliven Bundy.  His group’s backed down the federal government at gunpoint during the “bridge standoff” by having an equal tactical stand snipers and all.</p>

<p>Hell, Waco is half and half, the lost the siege on the presumption that the government wouldn’t murder unarmed people and children...  but they won the initial fire fight.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Divide and conquer. </p>

<p>Here in my relatively small city I have heard some startling information, from a credible source.</p>

<p>There is a fair sized naval base here, Canuck west coast. This base has reels of chain link and barbed wire complete with specialized hum-v&#39;s to put up these fences. </p>

<p>In a day or two they can have the entire city locked down and gated. </p>

<p>I imagine a similar plan is in place for most cities in North America... you know, in case of a &quot;disaster&quot;</p>

<p>Any &quot;compound&quot; at this point will be receiving Hellfire. Literally.  Waco and Ruby Ridge and Bundy were practice on soft targets. They practice hard target take down in White Sands.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, the other issue is that the gun owning conservatives who would be the primary resistance are mostly found in rural areas that would be impossible to lock down.  My city analogy wasn’t very good.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>After 911 Canada and the US made some bullshit agreement that allows US personel to come 50 miles into Canada over security issues or terrorist threats. </p>

<p>This means they can come to my door. </p>

<p>It seems that we are prepping up for something big. When the shit hits the fan it&#39;s all gonna get locked down hard. </p>

<p>If it ends up go time with Iran we are going to have WW3 on our hands and with America spread thin the west coast will get busy.</p>

<p>With posse comitatus over and UN troops galore, it will get ugly across the board. </p>

<p>But not every armed person is going to be rebellious either. There will be a big push on patriotism and many will go down without a fight. </p>

<p>Big out bags? Running into the woods will be a grievous mistake. IR and night vision will make short work of anyone in the sticks. And no witnesses.</p>

<p>Organization is the only hope and they would shut that down preemptively.</p>
