        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>At one point in the film, the main characters who started a fake war via the media for the public to consume in order to distract from a presidential scandal decide to create a fake war hero to go along with it. Since the war hero&#39;s name was &quot;Schuman&quot;, their next campaign was to get the public to toss their old shoes in his honor. At one point, they gleefully watch a video clip of an auditorium full of highschoolers unleash a barrage of shoes towards the camera. Their PR work was now on autopilot.</p>

<p>Fast forward 20 years later after that film&#39;s release.</p>

<p>I have been looking at some articles featuring the high school kids (one of him can barely talk despite supposedly being a journalist and the figurehead, but that is a story for another time) and the PR machine behind them. They are a creation of the media as much as they are a creation of their parent&#39;s copulation. The media and the powers that be know that the public are led by emotions and not reason.  Everything about these kids looks like astroturf. The rapidity with which their group formed, the gleeful smiles they make even after losing so many of their &quot;friends&quot; to a violent death, the obvious plays on the public&#39;s emotions all make me sick. This whole thing is a pageant and a charade, and I don&#39;t care about what <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>&#39;s newfound groups of shills think or say.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’ll give you that maybe these kids are being used to push an agenda, but please remember: These are young adults and teens. Some of their reactions which may seem off (“gleeful smiles”) can just as easily be attributed to emotional immaturity, which is completely normal given their ages.  </p>

<p>This is an horrific situation—just adding my 2 cents that we are dealing with young victims here</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was there in the flesh today at the Florida Capitol and saw what looked like a bunch of kids being kids, and repeating what the adults told them, so I think you&#39;re not far off. They are definitely being exploited by the gun control agenda no doubt. </p>

<p>As a side note, folks in this forum might appreciate knowing the local government here fancied themselves ultra progressive, and the county school system publicly announced yesterday they would excuse all school absences for students who wished to join the Parkland kids demonstrating, and almost all of them who possibly could, did. Sooooo, local government sent extra kids to make something that supports a narrative they support look like it has more interest than it actually did. I&#39;ve been working across the street from the Capitol for several years and today was by far, not even close to second, the most media I&#39;ve ever seen there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t see any kids in the wild today crying. Pretty much all laughing and cutting up walking to the demonstration area, or just being normal, which doesn&#39;t mean they don&#39;t have some real emotions, but the media is spinning the shit out of this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s just a bunch of kids being talked into pushing gun control despite how terrible of a case this is to do so.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it was both a small number of kids with their own thoughts and views and a large group doing what their teachers, parents, celebrities and friends said, and or what they thought was cool. In speaking with some coworkers, Sime of their children at multiple schools came home with professionally printed identical rally signs calling for gun control. That infuriates me to no end being a property owner and thus forced to pay taxes to support the local schools that are either themselves passing this crap out or allowing some political organization to do it. I witnessed several large groups of teens and tweens being led toward the Capitol by adults who were telling them what to do and say as they walked. It was a legit media circus, but again, I wouldn&#39;t say everyone and everything is disingenuine. Just that our local schools and whom ever the adults were walking with the kids were clearly pushing particular political views on these children who they were then putting in front of the cameras.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll tell you exactly why occams razor is complete trash when used on human nature.  It doesn&#39;t account for misdirection or conspiracy.  It&#39;s a great tool for science, where the things you are studying aren&#39;t trying to be deceitful, but once that human element comes into play, it should be thrown out the window.  Could you imagine if detectives use Occams Razor in investigations, it would be so fucked.  Imo, it&#39;s just a tool for thought policing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure. Is it being politicized, of course. Is it likely that after a school shooting fellow students of the school would voice their opinions just because they are pissed and want to change it however they can? No way, that is crazy. They must be deep state plants funded by liberal gun control globalist control illuminati. Crisis actors to control your mind man! Why would anyone be angry about little manchilds with military grade weapons killing kids and want to talk about it on MSM. Maybe they ( the students talking on MSM) should just write a letter in ancient Sumerian instead and bury it in a tin foil time capsule. </p>
