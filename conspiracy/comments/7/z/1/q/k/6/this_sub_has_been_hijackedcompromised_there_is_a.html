    <div class="md"><p>First off, I&#39;m not going to sit here and do a full survey or anything, but I decided to check the top four posts of today just to see. For each, the most upvoted comment was supportive. For two of them, the most upvoted comment was from the OP.</p>

<p>Second, yes, that is free thinking. Free thinking means people are allowed to confront beliefs and don&#39;t have to automatically subscribe to them.</p>

<p>As an aside, its pretty obvious why this sub has been more controversial lately. There aren&#39;t too many people who take kindly to an attempted cover up of a mass shooting involving children. Of course, people are free to spread the theory, but people are also free to condemn it. Censoring either prohibits free thinking.</p>

<p>I like a good conversation and a good conspiracy, but when u have 20 guys posting about the same conspiracy it becomes a shitshow.
