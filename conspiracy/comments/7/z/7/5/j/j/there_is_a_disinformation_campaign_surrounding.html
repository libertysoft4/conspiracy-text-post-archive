        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Copy and pasted most of this from a text comment I made earlier today. I&#39;ve seen a lot of nonsense spreading like wildfire. </p>

<p>I believe the &quot;Hogg went to Redondo Beach High School&quot; angle is a targeted disinformation campaign. Most of the people spreading it are likely just useful idiots that fell for it. <a href="https://imgur.com/785x3lM">Here is a tailormade compilation image of most of the bad info (I didn&#39;t create this).</a> People created fake &quot;classmates.com&quot; pages for Hogg @ Redondo, as well as a couple other similar sites; sites which can be edited by anyone. Screenshots/archives of these pages were spammed aggressively.</p>

<p>The Laguna Beach Antifa twitter account (some kind of troll account) - @lagunabeachantifa9  tweeted the picture of the yearbook claiming it was Redondo Beach. The twitter account&#39;s location is openly set as Krasnoyansk, Russia - looks like an obvious attempt at trolling to me. Too out in the open. </p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/_joey_wong/status/966181529885036549?ref_src=twcamp%5Eshare%7Ctwsrc%5Eios%7Ctwgr%5Eother%7Ctwcon%5E7100%7Ctwterm%5E2">This was later proven to be false by a twitter video of the actual yearbook.</a>. Not to mention the kid in the middle of the top row is wearing an Eagles shirt - the mascot of MSDHS.<a href="http://eagleeye.news/feature/msd-senior-david-hogg-goes-viral-youtube/"> As if we needed any more proof, theres also an article from the MSD HS newspaper talking about how Hogg went on vacation and had a viral youtube video.</a></p>

<p><a href="https://imgur.com/ZXKki3Y">This same twitter account posted the incorrect photo of &quot;Nicholas Cruz&quot; in an Antifa shirt. This was then retweeted by the fake Julian Assange twitter account. More disinfo.
</a></p>

<p><a href="https://imgur.com/qiH7WEX">The strangest one I came across was a copy of that picture of all the MSD Students at the news station with &quot;Bitconnect&quot; photoshopped in the background and onto Hogg&#39;s shirt.</a><a href="https://imgur.com/TbaSKiD"> A seperate poster told everyone &quot;Has anyone dug into Hogg and Bitconnect? Its the logo on his shirt.&quot;</a>.</p>

<p>Alltogether very odd stuff. IMO they&#39;re trying to muddy the waters, its pretty classic. Someone stated that it was a 4chan raid doing typically trolly 4chan shit. This lines up with the Bitconnect connection; bitconnect memes are big nowadays. </p>

<p>However, I tend to think that there is something more sinister going on. Seems a little too coordinated to just be 4chan. The pictures are spread like wildfire on twitter, voat, and the chans. So like I said, I think there is a disinfo campaign going on. The logic follows as such: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Start spreading easily disproved bullshit about Hogg. Useful idiots bite and spread the disinfo like crazy. </p></li>
<li><p>Information is easily disproved by people who do their due diligence for sources. </p></li>
<li><p>Label it all &quot;Crazy conspiracy theories&quot; [this is already being done by our good friends at CNN]</p></li>
<li><p>People asking reasonable questions about Hogg (i.e. FBI father, viral video, interviewing during shooting, practicing lines) are labeled as conspiracy theorists and discredited by association</p></li>
<li><p>Hogg is immune from any criticism or questions about motives. Discussion is ended. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>The whole thing is a mess and this just added to it. I&#39;m really not sure what to think of the whole situation. Just my 2 cents on whats going on behind the scenes. </p>

<p>This post brought to you by far too much coffee. </p>

<p>Now today all I see are people debunking the theory that he wasn&#39;t involved at all and didn&#39;t go to school there. I don&#39;t recall that being part of the legitimate discussion that was going on.

<p>A crisis actor is someone who pretends to have been a part of a crisis in order to push an agenda.</p>

<p>If you are the legitimate victim of a crisis, you aren&#39;t <em>acting</em> like you were anymore. You actually were.</p>

<p>Someone being paid by the news to pretend to have been a Hurricane Katrina victim in order to bash the Bush administration would be a crisis actor.</p>

<p>Someone who actually lost their house in the hurricane, and later went on the news to talk shit about Bush, is not a crisis actor. Even if they got offered money to do it, that doesn&#39;t somehow make the fact that they are the victim of the crisis illegitimate. They&#39;re not &quot;acting&quot;. They were actually in the crisis.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>So a person who was involved but is using it as a means to push the agenda of others isn&#39;t acting in the midst of a crisis? Sounds like a crisis actor to me</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you are the legitimate victim of a crisis, you aren&#39;t acting like you were anymore. You actually were.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s right. You can also act like you&#39;re more outraged than you really are. Or you can act like it&#39;s solely a gun issue when you know it&#39;s a myriad of things.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Someone being paid by the news to pretend to have been a Hurricane Katrina victim in order to bash the Bush administration would be a crisis actor.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They sure would. So would the scenario described above.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Someone who actually lost their house in the hurricane, and later went on the news to talk shit about Bush, is not a crisis actor.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nope, not necessarily. Doesn&#39;t mean they absolutely couldn&#39;t be though. If CNN paid this hypothetical person enough money to rebuild their life if they talked shit on Bush, would you consider that acting or no? To me, it&#39;s someone telling you what to do. &quot;Agent&quot; might be a better word than &quot;actor&quot;...they are being used for political means, so to me they are viewed in the same manner. Acting would be involved though, so I don&#39;t consider it disingenuous to use the word.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Even if they got offered money to do it, that doesn&#39;t somehow make the fact that they are the victim of the crisis illegitimate.
Nobody said it would be illegitimate. Maybe their avenue for outrage would be illegitimate, as they are being paid and influenced to point the blame at someone for political means.</p>

<p>They&#39;re not &quot;acting&quot;. They were actually in the crisis.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can be in a crisis and still act. The show just starts a little later when the crisis is done and the narrative begins to take form.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What is happening is people that are not familiar with the conspiracy theorist term &quot;crisis actor&quot;, which definitely has a specific meaning very close to:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A crisis actor is someone who pretends to have been a part of a crisis in order to push an agenda.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>are using the term in a different context with a different meaning and then arguing that the original definition is invalid or never existed. </p>

<p>I just don&#39;t know if these people are unintentionally using the term incorrectly or are intentionally using the term incorrectly in order to slander conspiracy and conservative leaning subs. When we see the mainstream news reports, which should happen any moment now, about how right wingers on the internet are calling all the students on TV pushing gun control &quot;crisis actors&quot; and they go on to tell their viewers it means right wingers think the shooting didn&#39;t happen and these students are actors in a false flag meant to disarm the public, then we will know the true intentions of these commenters. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why do you think he&#39;s being used for an agenda? If you&#39;re fine with saying he was a student there then you should be fine with accepting that he was there when the school was shot up.  Why would it be crazy to assume that, since he was apart of the shooting and was hoping not to die,  also alive and probably aware of recent mass murders, he would want gun laws stricter? I suppose there are two ways you walk out of a mass shooting.  Either calls to arm yourself or calls to disarm others...so what agenda, assuming he was there,  do you think he truly believes in? </p>

We might be witnessing a key moment here where the term &quot;crisis actor&quot; starts being applied to people even if they were present for a real crisis, so long as what that person says goes against a certain viewpoint.

    <div class="md"><p>I’m sorry so just to clarify - you’re saying a crisis actor does NOT have to be an unrelated third party paid to be on TV? You can be legitimately involved - let’s say the brother of a murder victim - and if the media is using you to push an agenda you are still a crisis actor? That’s a pretty broad definition. By that logic anyone can be a crisis actor. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, it makes perfect sense for a news organization to risk losing all credibility with literally everyone, forever, by offering high schoolers money to pretend to have been in a mass shooting, and praying that not a single one of them tells a soul about it.</p>

<p>And this goes without mentioning how CNN must have gotten a lot of kids to pretend to die, gotten a lot of paramedics to pretend to treat wounded, gotten a lot of hospital staff to pretend to treat children with bullet wounds, gotten a lot of police to pretend to arrest a guy, and gotten a guy to willfully spend the rest of his life in prison for the fake shooting.</p>

<p>This is much more likely than these students really being victims of a mass shooting.</p>

<p>We&#39;re all on the same page here, except for a significant portion of this community who can&#39;t even agree on that.</p>

<p>But the kids are also actors pretending to care about what happened or about laws that directly affected them, hired by CNN who risked literally everything on high schoolers keeping their mouths shut??</p>

<p>Because someone who was almost murdered can&#39;t care about that without having Soros&#39; hand shoved up their asshole like a puppet?</p>

<p>I find it very doubtful that this conspiracy sub could trend a video on YouTube. I know you said &quot;and elsewhere&quot;, but I think the &quot;elsewhere&quot; did most of the work on making that video trend.</p>

<p>BTW, I don&#39;t think he&#39;s a crisis actor or anything like that. I think he&#39;s an opportunist getting propped up by vultures in the media, but that&#39;s another story... and saying that the media takes advantage of victims during emotional times isn&#39;t much of a conspiracy theory. ;-)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m also a regular at t_d and have been a regular here far longer.</p>

<p>In t_d there was speculation about different theories when the video in California surfaced, but it was never widely refuted that he was a student or witnessed the shooting. The culture in t_d is very fact-based and the community is very, very proud of that. Claims are challenged and researched by other pedes all the time. Honestly you would know that if you actually browsed the sub for a few days.</p>

<p>I first heard of this &quot;evidence&quot; today from a friend because I didn&#39;t see it on t_d (granted I wasn&#39;t browsing much today), and I was really skeptical of the whole thing because CNN wouldn&#39;t be so stupid as to make that mistake. And it looks like I was right, and other people felt the same way, which is why we are both here.</p>

<p>And the &quot;crisis actor&quot; accusations never circled around whether or not he was a student, or if the shooting happened. It was about how he was caught fumbling his script on camera, and also caught rehearsing it <em>during</em> the shooting, and before his interviews.</p>

<p>Also, the kid comes off as a pure psychopath. And all his pals follow the same script and have numerous ties to CNN and activist groups before the shooting. And FBI father is part of some super shady business deals during the 2008 financial crisis with all banks and all sorts of other swamp creatures.</p>

Just like with your comment here, where you claim the sub is fact based and that no one questioned if he was actually a student but then proceed to speculate and quote outrageous fake news claims to pretend he has no right to speak all because he practiced his words before going on camera.</p>

<p>I once saw a TD post saying that CNN is fake news because a reporter had a round table with random citizens during the Hillary / Trump debate and repeated one of Hilary&#39;s quotes for the citizen she was talking to. The TD fools would rather believe it was lies and scripted and that the guy was coached than accept that she simply repeated Hillary&#39;s words so that the dude would have proper context. So much for fact based i guess.</p>

<p>It could be him being used as the &quot;spokesman&quot; of this tragedy because his viewpoint is in-line with the normal MSM narrative.

When I think back to high school and the kids that were the heads of the model UN, LGBT group etc. those are exactly the kids who would be outspoken and capitalizing on the chance to be a part of the solution to the issue.  What would be weird is if they weren’t those type of kids and just kinda kept to themselves and didn’t really say much then all of a sudden became this outspoken piece.  Weird, ambitious kids being weird on camera while opposing guns after their classmates were shot sounds par for the course. </p>

<p>Depends on who he is debating, how the debate goes, and who is watching. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Wouldn’t you prefer to have an emotional kid try and make a plea then the experts themselves?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, I&#39;d rather hear well thought-out viewpoints from knowledgeable and experienced individuals. I like to learn new things and am not afraid to have certain viewpoints changed in light of new information. Everyone should be open to that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The gun control debate is not a brand new thing, these debates happen all the time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I know, how does this help move the ball though? It seems like more of an emotional appeal than one to logic...which is not helpful.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Even if he was pushed into this position by other forces, he still has to follow through and makes the points.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The debate itself is not the problem, it&#39;s a symptom. A kid involved in a school shooting doesn&#39;t have the credentials to debate gun control on a national stage. I&#39;ve shot an AR15 a few times now...why am I not being called to this debate? (Joking, but not really)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Taylor Swift was basically pushed into the spot light by her rich dad buying a label but she still had to sing and perform when she got there.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Even those that don&#39;t appreciate her music would say she is talented, and her looks certainly aren&#39;t hurting her. I don&#39;t view this as analogous to David Hogg and gun control.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The point is that we will find out during the debate if David Hogg is a talented debater or not. If Taylor Swift wasn’t talented then she wouldn’t have stayed in the spot light or made an impact. In fact, the person Hogg is debating might be able to point out that maybe he is too inexperienced and emotional regarding the topic to debate it with a level head and he could even hurt the cause. Either way, both sides of the gun debate try to capitalize on opportunities like this so I’m having trouble seeing why it would be a conspiracy.  </p>

Now tell me; who have you ever known, who went through the majority of puberty without ANY change in facial structure? I also believe that&#39;s why he always looks diagonal; as you mature your shoulders naturally raise. I think he&#39;s diagonal, unintentionally, by trying to hide the raised shoulders</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If anything, I&#39;d just say Hogg is being groomed by his dad and career interests.  He wants to be a journalist and he just so happens to be at a place where there is going to be people looking for interviews so him jumping at that opportunity to speak any and everywhere is not unlikely.  </p>

<p>The sad/scary part of all this is that this experience is going to look amazing on his resume when he goes to try and get into an agency like CNN.  They&#39;ll have a &quot;school shooting survivor&quot; so his opinion on guns will &quot;mean more&quot; than anyone else talking about the subject on the network.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that happens a lot, to many people. Everyone has a different scale for how deep a certain conspiracy goes. Each one has a spectrum of people who leverage potential real facts that were left out vs the narrative pushed.  Then an attempt to connect other dots once a potential lead of info stops. In this case with &quot;crisis actors &quot;,( which people know do exist, just don&#39;t have company info on the events that are legitimate or not) its complicated of course. Some may think that the entire thing was a staged drill  (highly unlikely) far too many children have big mouths and would definitely spill the beans if one of their friends &quot;died&quot;. </p>

<p>Others think the attack is real, but the news uses actors who can get the shots they want for narrative purposes.  ( could they have convinced one of those kids to go on a political rant about issues they think they know all about? [IE. Gun bans] Sure, they are emotional kids. And easily manipulated). Then exalt the shit out of a poor child to emotionally change opinions. </p>

<p>Then there are the ones that are more nuanced. In Florida&#39;s case, is there a potential motive from the FBI to ALLOW this to happen? Knowing they have the ability to change perspective and completely control a crime scene. Does that connect to more info of corruption if someone outside of school but involved with Cruz&#39; life  could have MKultra&#39;d him , knowing his past, into committing the crime? Then with FBI&#39;s connection to Hogg&#39;s dad, had him coach his son on how to act and what to say to get himself the most attention? Or did the news already know that Hogg went there and specifically sought him out to tell a version of the events that would fit what they are trying to push. Are these crisis actors actually all just disinformation? Used as distractions from other things. Knowing people want to call out bad actors instead of looking elsewhere? </p>

<p>I could go on but I think you get what I&#39;m trying to say. Some people take every conspiracy all the way down to complete &quot;Zionist control&quot; saying that almost every aspect of knowledge and control are at the hands of them. Manipulating everything behind the scenes. Others stay at the surface and only blame the government for usually having prior knowledge yet never doing anything, leading to the assumption that they aren&#39;t actually doing their job but purposefully just keeping people docile with fake evidence or lack there of any at all. </p>

<p>Your right, its all convoluted. But that is usually  why some are so believable. There are so many ties in a conspiracy that it mirrors real life. To many coincidences piled up do not look like accidents. And with the advancement in technology coupled with the knowledge of human corruption make skeptics wonder. Some more than others haha. </p>

They put deliberate effort into these propaganda pushes even if they act like it&#39;s all just fun and games trolling once they&#39;re caught in the act. They&#39;re no stranger to faking stuff just to shift the narrative, such as the fake fake Steel dossier they made to &quot;prove&quot; how fake the real one was. The goal with this stuff was simply to try to associate the shooter with the far left. Even if the propaganda itself is shoddy, it still has a big effect, because it almost always takes more time and effort to disprove a lie than to come up with one and spread it.</p>

<p>Maybe. My feeling is that there are maybe 20-30 content-creator and influence-maker types on 4chan who start stuff, then several hundred enthusiastic but uncreative types who take it out into the world, then thousands of useful idiots who have little comprehension of the politics proper, but pass it along out of the group/tribal identity.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sorry, but this has been debunked many times before. Society has a right to require you to adhere to certain norms and moral codes. In fact, society means &quot;a group of people with certain norms and  morals&quot;.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t want to hire to gays cause they are prone to mischief and you are a Christian? The left says &quot;nein!&quot;, so yeah very non-controlling. Don&#39;t want to bake a cake? The left says &quot;nein!&quot;. Want to defend yourself from criminals and the Clintons? The left says nein, nein, nein!!11!111!&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Got it, debunked. Degenerates don&#39;t deserve the same rights as morally upstanding god fearing warriors. Business matters more than personal liberty, and so does money. Be a cog and don&#39;t live the way you want or risk your livelihood. Business has the power to deny you basic goods and services. Really educating me on who exactly wants to control my life.</p>

<p>I wonder if cohering to societies &quot;norms and morals&quot; only applies to the scary homos? Once we&#39;ve identified who can and can&#39;t work or exist when does it move onto other minorities, or women, or how you dress, or men with long hair, or people of other faiths? Fit in or be expelled sounds pretty authoritarian to me.</p>

<p>Going to answer any other of my points? Or is being disappointed society doesn&#39;t want you to openly lynch queers your only argument? You going to keep misconstruing the definition of &quot;society&quot;? </p>

<p>You have no idea what the left is, and if you think the Clinton&#39;s are leftist you&#39;re delusional. I wonder who has a history of imperialistic world domination, if only we could open a book and find out... it couldn&#39;t be right wing Christians annexing and colonizing every single piece of land available, it couldn&#39;t be authoritarian governments interfering in other peoples government and society, no no no. It&#39;s the dirty queers who want basic rights and access to services that want to dominate the world.</p>

 &quot;the authoritarian state still maintains a certain distinction between state and society. It is only concerned with political power and as long as that is not contested it gives society a certain degree of liberty.&quot;</p>

<p>You claimed &quot;totalitarian systems are just some guy(s) who aren&#39;t managing a society in any capacity, at all.&quot; Please provide evidence that this is true.</p>

<p>Canada doesn&#39;t let in people with misdemeanors and mexico has a policy of shoot-to-kill suspected criminals coming over the border from Guatemala. Do you have issues with those countries&#39; policies?</p>

<p>There is no, and I repeat no, country on earth that allows in people based on the fact that they want it. It simply doesn&#39;t occur.

    <div class="md"><p>I mean that is one way to look at it..Another way is that without the more incriminating false information all that remains is</p>

<p>&quot;He filmed a weird video during the shooting, which seemd odd&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;he stutterd at what he was saying in an interview&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;His father is a retired federal agent&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He seems to be trying to become a youtube personality or such like&quot;</p>

<p>While all of this is suspicious, is doesn&#39;t point towards DH being a crisis actor or the florida shooting being a FF. It just points towards him being a bit weird.</p>

<p>The fact he is focused so much on gun control as an issue makes Occam razor sense to me because THAT&#39;S THE THING THAT WAS USED TO KILL 17 PEOPLE HE KNEW.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is it unfathomable that kids that were in danger of getting shot to death at school, and just watched 17 of their friends die, might be for a little gun control?</p>

<p>Of course the main left-leaning channels are going to emphasise it. That&#39;s not even a fucking conspiracy, that&#39;s common sense.</p>

<p>But treating this kids like they don&#39;t have an opinion of their own is just worrysome to me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh I believe people and kids are for gun control.</p>

<p>I just believe they were brainwashed into thinking that way.</p>

<p>The right to self defense is a natural right. If the Chinese invaded tomorrow, I shouldn&#39;t have to call the military or police in order to defend myself, if that is what I choose to do. Same goes for any other scenario.  I know right now it seems like an easy solution to a scary problem, but absolving yourself legally of your right to bear arms should never be a considered solution for the reasons mentioned above.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I could make a whole host of arguments about why your guns wouldn&#39;t be that effective against an invading army that probably would&#39;ve been met by the military when they arrived, but I&#39;ll refrain.</p>

<p>I&#39;m Australian, but I would never advocate a complete ban on all guns in America. But do you need more than a pistol to defend your home? Anything else seems like overkill and makes these events more tragic than they have to be.</p>

<p>If the answer is &quot;guns are fun for responsible gun owners&quot;, well the minority are ruining it for you. Push for gun restrictions that allow you the freedom to defend yourself and also make the tragic death of school kids less likely. Completely refusing all measures of gun control just make it more likely it&#39;ll be taken away when the right is abused again and again.</p>

Is he just gonna toss it in there to the catcher, or is he going to wind up and see if he can throw a strike from 60&#39; 6&quot; away?  Sure, that kid&#39;s going to come off a little goofy and look like a try-hard, just like Hogg did.  But that&#39;s normal when you get confronted with a chance to fulfill you dreams.</p>

<p>And people saying that the kids aren&#39;t acting they way someone would act after such a traumatic event, bullshit.  Everyone responds differently to crisis.</p>

<p>For example, Alefantis is a Rothschild.</p>

<p>THe very first day, we established his ancestry fairly well. So, when they push the wrong narrative, it discredits everyone.</p>

<p>Just the other day, I had a post removed by a mod from this sub that showed Alefantis interview where he admits there is a basement that he stores the tomato jars in.</p>

<p>It was removed for revealing personal info.</p>

<p>If a person goes on the news or does an interview for a magazine THAT IS NOT PERSONAL DETAILS. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Personally, I think there are a lot of compelling to reasons to believe in some of the darker stuff, but I know for 100% fact, through FEC records and other financial information that has been made public, that Comet Ping Pong is a money laundering node for the DNC, Alefantis has other money laundering nodes and they are taking foreign money and cycling it through in ways that are attempting to conceal how much foreign collusion is really happening.</p>

<p>I also know Alefantis&#39; boyfriend, David Brock has multiple media outlets he owns and controls and they were both being blackmailed together, at the same time.</p>

<p>So, there is enough reason for them to go to jail, already.</p>

<p>Their lawyer is convicted trafficker, Laura Silsby&#39;s cohort. Along with a couple of proven ,well established connections through the mining industry, it is a fact that the Clintons are tied to human trafficking.</p>

<p>Nobody is investigating the investigators, so even an investigation into this doesn&#39;t yield much for the public.</p>

<p>It&#39;s revenue, alone, is not much, at all. Last I check it was around $250k. My anecdotal experience is that, on paper, that is squeaking by, as most retail should average about 1k per day.</p>

<p>So, at first glance, he is a humble restarauntuer.</p>

<p>But, then, what is the Pagasus Museum? What is Transformer selling and why is Kamala Harris&#39; sister, Maya involved?</p>

The fact that he was blackmailed was made public over 5 years ago by Fox News. The blackmail was over supposedly damning evidence his ex-lover had. My problem with that is Brock A. went to the police with the blackmail emails and texts and B. then went to court.

    <div class="md"><p>The only reason Fox News covered this was because it was something to make Media Matters and their lib media look bad. And since their goal was to make them look as bad as possible, I am more than sure that they sent reporters to talk to the blackmailer. And since they didn&#39;t report on anything, he must not have been reliable or actually have anything whatsoever. They probably realized this was some lovers quarrel and the guy was probably some scrub that lost his golden goose. So he started threatening to get money. As an example, I had an employee that kept showing up at my house texting me and trying to date me. I knew she was crazy and kept telling her no. One night, she showed up and told me that she was going to ruin my life. While I knew I had not done anything wrong, I was still freaked out. Welp, the next Monday, she went to my boss and told them I promised her a promotion if she fucked me. Luckily for me, I had text messages from her showing she was a stalker and crazy af. Without those texts, I would have been fired. It is more than likely the same type scenario</p>

<p>It is to distract from a false narrative. He has a basement, where he stores food supplies FOR COMET PING PONG. He is a liar and the shills focus on this argument as if it has anything to do with anything.</p>

<p>Edit: probably more grey or black. I really don&#39;t care about this kids background. I just don&#39;t think a gun ban is going to make the United States safer. The United States is far too big and her citizens too stubborn for a ban to ever be effective. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That photo of the group of kids together, and the black woman (news anchor?) in the foreground: does anyone have any more details about this? Context? An explanation how that group of people would all be together for a group photo smiling and happy (which wouldn&#39;t make much sense if the photo was taken after the shooting, I presume it was taken before)... and then later after the shooting, 3 or 4 of them just happen to be the main figureheads all over news and social media talking about the event, and gun control?</p>

<p>That seems like a huge coincidence to me. Which it very well could be just that, nothing is impossible. But in light of all the other conspiracy controversy being discussed, it just seems especially curious.</p>

<p>What are the chances they&#39;d all be in a photo op like that, and then 3 or 4 of them constantly getting the media spotlight after the shooting?</p>

<p>A thought that comes to mind, is if the group photo was from some kind of media/press outreach type event at school for kids interested in joining the workforce of media/press, that the reporter used that established connection with the kids to quickly contact them and line up press events after the shooting occurred, to get a &quot;quick scoop&quot;. That&#39;s the first plausible, rational, explanation I can think of.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Didn&#39;t you have those kids at your high school? In my experience there were always kids (usually friends) that were pretty outspoken. I don&#39;t see how that would invalidate the things they are discussing though. They were there when the shooting happened. Do you need to see someone that was shot in order to believe that they want some regulations around firearms? </p>

<p>Other kids that are pro freedom of access to firearms could speak out too, but that&#39;s like asking a student whose classmate just was killed by a drunk driver what they think about DUI laws. It just isn&#39;t gonna happen. That&#39;s why you are only seeing one side. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you missed my point and my puzzlement.  I have since found more info on what I was referring to, so I&#39;ll do a brief write up and clarification:</p>

<p>A photo was floating around of Hogg and other kids, and adults, all in a group smiling and laughing, as if 17 of their classmates had not just been recently murdered.  It looked so unnatural, that I just assumed the photo was taken before the shooting.  Hogg and at least 2 or 3 others in the photo have been the most visible, outspoken kids from the school rabidly calling for gun control.  Therefore, my question in my previous comment, was &quot;how does this make sense, that these kids would all be in the photo together, then later turn out to be the most outspoken figures after the shooting?&quot; </p>

<p>Turns out, I was misunderstanding, because I had no original source. The photo was from a CBS news anchor planning to do interviews and give the kids a speaking platform. The photo was taken 3 or 4 days after the shooting... which leads me back to my comment, my disbelief <em>at how utterly weird it appears that they&#39;re all super happy, all smiles, not a trace of grief, and ready to launch into this whole gun control media campaign.</em></p>

<p>The CBS news anchor has since deleted her tweet with the photo, stating that some people thought it was in &quot;poor taste&quot; so she removed it.  So, more I&#39;m just back to my original puzzled thought as to how yet bizarre it looks that these kids are not good stricken in that photo, taken just days after the event.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not even insinuating any kind of deep conspiracy angle here. It is near impossible for me to imagine any semi-realistic scenario involving &quot;crisis actors&quot; the way some people so eagerly clutch to the idea.  I am insinuating that it is really, really bizarre how unfazed and not grief-stricken these kids appear to be, in fact the opposite, <em>and that they&#39;re immediately being paraded around as political tools, gun control advocates, and they are even EAGER for it!</em> It&#39;s a really bizarre appearance.  I&#39;m not the only one to think that -- the CBS news anchor tried to work that photo off the face of Twitter.</p>

<p>All that, <em>plus</em> in the site I&#39;m linking below, one of the kids tweets that (paraphrasing), &quot;they won&#39;t be taken advantage of by anyone in the Trump administration, because they know their slimy tactics <strong>and have been training</strong>(??) for it&quot; -- which is odd in itself, <strong>but is further bizarrely ironic</strong> that <em>the media</em> is currently and actively taking advantage of them....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not a fan of your source, because it seems way too focused on creating a narrative, but I did go to the twitter feed. I agree it does seem a bit odd. I still don&#39;t buy that these kids are part of some conspiracy or actors. I think they may just live in a political household and so they feel very strongly about their views. </p>

<p>When I was younger I didn&#39;t really pay that much attention to politics, but as I reached the end of high school and adulthood I took more of an interest. For these kids that happened while this current media circus has been going on. Both sides are so over the top it&#39;s hard to just get facts. I think that is what you are seeing, the new normal for trying to take the moral high ground. That is why these kids seem so outspoken and involved. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also, the school has a student body of 3,300.  That&#39;s got to be a fairly large campus.  Most students probably barely knew what was going on, if at all, so they all wouldn&#39;t be as traumatized as the kids who were immediately involved and in harm&#39;s way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t see your point. Suppose that the kids giving these interviews weren&#39;t shot at and didn&#39;t have a friend die. Do you think that prevents them from having an opinion about what happened? Classmates and teachers were still murdered. This still happened at their school, to their community. Are we going to implement a requirement that you can&#39;t speak out about a tragedy unless you were wounded? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m adding to your point.  The reason they could be smiling and posing for pictures is that perhaps they were far removed from the actual attack and were never really in any harm. I&#39;m just coming up with another possible explanation as to why some of the people weren&#39;t visible traumatized.  I was more keying into the person you were responding to when they said they couldn&#39;t understand how people could be smiling and happy after such and incident.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like how it&#39;s a conspiracy to have actual victims of a mass shooting believe stricter gun laws need to happen. As if a victim of something like this could not possibly want gun control without payment or coercion. </p>

<p>As if a teenager who&#39;s going to be paid attention to by media because of the situation wouldn&#39;t want to rehearse explaining their point of view so they don&#39;t come off as bumbling, traumatized, and inarticulate. You know, like most adults do who aren&#39;t used to being in front of a camera.</p>

<p>And when a politician pushes an agenda for stricter gun control if that&#39;s what their constituents want, then they&#39;re automatically accused of taking advantage of the situation. But uhh yeah, it&#39;s possible that they&#39;re taking &quot;advantage&quot; of the situation to push the change that their constituents are screaming at them to push.</p>

<p>I guess if a person lives in a fantasy world where nobody could possibly believe in gun control, then anyone who wants gun control must be the product of malicious intent by TPTB to take something of yours away. The conspiracy comes down to those who would dare disagree.</p>

<p>I know someone will just accuse me of being a shill because that&#39;s how it goes, but whatever. I tried to have a vested interest in improving my country, but when any attempt at doing something good to change the status quo is met with accusations of shilling or conspiracies to undermine the American way of life, it&#39;s exhausting to continue caring if not impossible for some.</p>

<p>If we as a country are so unable to accept that people might have points of view to attempt to make society better, and instead we&#39;re just going to make up conspiracy narratives about the people with whom we disagree while continuing to live in a society where it&#39;s common for broken human beings to want to mass murder those around them, then we&#39;re fundamentally broken.</p>

<p>I actually like shooting since I grew up with guns and learned how to fire rifles at a young age. That&#39;s beside the point though. Frankly I don&#39;t know what the real solution is because the problem is probably a combination of mental illness and lax gun laws in my opinion. Even more troubling is that it&#39;s hard not to come to the conclusion that we simply don&#39;t care about each other enough to stop a child from growing up and wanting to do this to people. </p>

<p>It makes me want to move to a country where, while it might not replace everything I would miss about this country, at least people seem to care about each other more.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We have to be very careful, because the powers that be are playing chess and we&#39;re playing checkers.</p>

<p>It was actually a false flag, set up as a drill, and then actually happened.  They run crisis actors so they can control the narrative.</p>

<p>However, they know that we&#39;re watching, so their tactic is to throw out weak evidence (which they have a ready made response for) so that when conspiracy theorists run with their bait, they expose it for being weak.  </p>

<p>I&#39;ve been falling for it myself, sharing the things which are extremely suspicious, yet aren&#39;t solid.  For example, the classmates(dot)com screenshot.  Anyone can enter him in there and say he was at a different high school.  Another example is the photo claiming he went to a different school, when a video comes out (much stronger than a random photo) of someone with the stoneman yearbook and him in it.</p>

<p>We have to examine everything, and not just focus on what could be baits.  We have to verify what we can also before posting.  The burden of proof is on us, and a single inaccuracy destroys any credibility.</p>

<p>PS, interesting coincidence, &quot;Stoneman&quot; high school.  (Freemason lingo?)</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure someone will come to defend the honor of Russia or whatever, so, before you do:</p>

<p>Trump said &quot;I don&#39;t believe they interfered&quot; about Russia. He now concedes they did. He still hasn&#39;t enacted the bipartisan sanctions against them that he signed. Legit reason why? </p>

<p>Kushner&#39;s emails discuss meeting Russians as part of &quot;the Russian government&#39;s support for Mr. Trump.&quot; Instead of calling the FBI, Kushner said, &quot;I love it!&quot; and went to the meeting. </p>

<p>So, yeah....I don&#39;t buy that Trump/Russia is a manufactured hoax by the MSM and Dems. Moreover, I don&#39;t believe you buy that either, unless you can explain the two items above. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly, watching all of this come out yesterday and the media reaction to it, I think you’ve hit the nail square on the head with this.</p>

<p>This was designed to draw out shitty conspiracy theorists and create a large, loud wave before anything was proven.  Then the media just needed to prove the things that you have here and, all of a sudden, now conservatives are ALL the embodiment of absolute monsters made of pure evil.</p>

<p>It’s incredible how easily people got played by this shit.  Everyone is on edge, looking for conspiracies. They knew the atmosphere was right. People fell right into it. </p>

<p>Edit: one other thing I’ve noticed is the scope of how many people this reached. The people on my FB feed who are NEVER political spoke out about the evil people picking on David Hoagg.  I know these people...the kind of media effort it takes to get them to show interest in a political story is no small feat.  In other words, this campaign was MASSIVE. </p>

A head of a small white supremacist group told a bunch of MSM outlets Cruz was a part of their group, then after it was reported, the white supremacist leader recanted and the right hit the MSM for not verifying that Cruz was in the white supremacist group and just taking the leader of the white supremacist group&#39;s word for it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great post!</p>

<p>Your point hit the nail on the head for me. Now we need to look at the bigger picture.</p>

<p>It&#39;s quite clear if you look at social media, news &amp; reddit that there is another campaign going on. there are fountains of posts attempting to encourage civilians to support gun control or subtlety scare civilians to  support it.</p>

<p>For example look at that walk out of school trend. Setup so professionally and spread on social meda (which is used by nieve kids and teenagers) to encourage them to rebel for tighter gun control. All this propaganda is being thrown in our faces and with this society everyone wanting to fit in this is perfect to control people. This is only the tip of the ice berg with all of the bots recently and the media manipulation controlled by the government. This world is mad.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m also a regular at t_d and have been a regular here far longer.</p>

<p>In t_d there was speculation about different theories when the video in California surfaced, but it was never widely refuted that he was a student or witnessed the shooting. The culture in t_d is very fact-based and the community is very, very proud of that. Claims are challenged and researched by other pedes all the time. Honestly you would know that if you actually browsed the sub for a few days.</p>

<p>I first heard of this &quot;evidence&quot; today from a friend because I didn&#39;t see it on t_d (granted I wasn&#39;t browsing much today), and I was really skeptical of the whole thing because CNN wouldn&#39;t be so stupid as to make that mistake. And it looks like I was right, and other people felt the same way, which is why we are both here.</p>

<p>And the &quot;crisis actor&quot; accusations never circled around whether or not he was a student, or if the shooting happened. It was about how he was caught fumbling his script on camera, and also caught rehearsing it <em>during</em> the shooting, and before his interviews.</p>

<p>Also, the kid comes off as a pure psychopath. And all his pals follow the same script and have numerous ties to CNN and activist groups before the shooting.
