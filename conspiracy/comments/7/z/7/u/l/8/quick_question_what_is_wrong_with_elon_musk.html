    <div class="md"><p>Dude, have you looked at Wall Street?</p>

<p>The most valuable companies in the Fortune 100 are all government contractors.  Are you saying defense companies shouldnt be rewarded with tax dollars for building the planes and tanks for the US military?  Why shouldnt SpaceX be compensated for providing services to the government?  They are fulfilling a need to get supplies to the ISS at a cost lower than what we paid for NASA to do it themselves.  We are saving taxpayer dollars using SpaceX rather than having NASA farm it out to the same defense companies that provide the tanks and planes.</p>

<p>If you dont think we should spend money on space exploration, that&#39;s a whole separate issue.  The fact is it took the government and its resources to contract with all the major companies in order to put man on the Moon.  No single company could have done it.</p>

<p>The government is the best innovator on the planet.  This thing we call the internet was a DARPA project that got transferred to the public sector.  SIRI was a DARPA project at Stanford.  Do you have any idea how many of these technologies that have changed the course of our lives started as government funded research projects?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didnt say it say it requires the government, I&#39;m simply pointing out that the pure research done through government funding that gets transferred to the public sector is what has made us a superpower and allowed us to deploy the worlds most technologically advanced military in the world.</p>

<p>Musk developed Dragon on his own dime.  Then he got a government contract to provide re-supply missions to ISS.  That money he used to develop heavy lift rockets.  That provides another need to the government we have been fulfilling through taxpayer dollars to Russia.</p>

<p>This is a net good thing for America.  Why are you so down on American innovation?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m saying you&#39;re downplaying their role in the process.  That you&#39;re not fully understanding how these parts interconnect and drive American progress.  It was the government that deployed the transcontinental railroad, the power grid, the phone network, the wireless spectrum, the moon mission, the internet, digital broadcasting and so many more huge technologies that had a high cost of entry and needed scale in order to make them affordable.</p>

<p>What else are we talking about?  Subsidies for EV cars via Tesla?  The subsidies that go to consumers and ultimately lower the cost for embracing new technologies in order to drive their price down through scale?  Elon Musk doesnt get those subsidies.  They just make the cars or panels more affordable for consumers.  He already paid back the federal grants to create Tesla, which employs thousands of Americans now.  I&#39;d say that&#39;s a better tradeoff than building a bomb with taxpayer dollars that explodes in some third world country and does ultimately nothing.</p>

<p>That&#39;s the reason there&#39;s so much income inequality with the rich getting super greedy and just accumulating wealth, because they want to be the first ones to advance. You might think elon is evil or trying to do the same thing, but he is just being smart and letting others know what&#39;s coming.
