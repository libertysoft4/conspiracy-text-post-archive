    <div class="md"><p>I mean, I&#39;m with you, but the grander truth is that none of the above possibilities (liberal, Muslim, Trump supporter)  are conspiracies in themselves.</p>

<p>Even the lack of talk about him being a Trump supporter isn&#39;t a conspiracy, I think rather it&#39;s just something certain members of this sub would rather pretend isn&#39;t the case. Maybe that also motivates some of the false-flag reasoning.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And yet conservatives embraced racism openly and refuse to denounce it. The GOP is allowing a straight up real live Nazi to run for them in Illinois. Seriously though, every one should reject those tennants. Instead, the current manifestation of the GOP and its leadership either ignore it or embrace it. One of trumps first acts was to cut funding to domestice white nationalist counter-terrorism!</p>

<p>If you truly are against these things then stand against them. Red or blue. Doesn&#39;t matter. It shouldn&#39;t be worth it just for a vote. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jesus Christ if that isn&#39;t fucking misleading. GOP officials have repeatedly and openly denounced racism and neo-nazis.</p>

<p>The guy you&#39;re talking about is the only candidate that has thus far signed up to run in the GOP primary for the third congressional district, a district that has gone to the democrats since fucking 1975. To think why he or anyone else would waste their time running on the republican ticket in that district I wouldn&#39;t no.</p>

<p>Next, pretty much anyone can run in the damn primary, you essentially just need to be registered with the party and then sign up and say I&#39;m running in the primary, maybe you need a few signatures. If you do those things, you can&#39;t be denied candidacy in the primary. To pretend this guy has ANY party backing (the exact opposite actually, it looks like a lot of party members have come out and actively denounced -- which you say they never do -- his candidacy), or that the GOP at all cares about this district race, or that he has any chance of winning is just pure fucking lunacy.</p>

<p>Get the fuck out of here with this blatantly misleading garbage.</p>

Your speaking in whataboutisms. Someone makes a comment about conservatives being racist, fear mongering, and using hate speech. All you can do is say, the left is guilty of the same things! While that’s true. It’s not what we were talking about. You’re trying to take the blame off of some people because some other people on the other team do it too. </p>

<p>Someone mentioned something about conservatives and their negative ideologies. You immediately start harping about liberals. No one mentioned them. You brought them up. No one else. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>It doesn’t in the big picture, but in this conversation it does. You completely changed what he subject was. We were talking about toxic conservatism and how it lead to a man who supports trump to go and shoot up a school. That’s a fact. Then you come in and have to harp about how liberals do it too! You’re changing the conversation completely to a narrative you’re more comfortable with. Off topic and derailing conversation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Conservatism didn&#39;t lead this kid to go out and shoot up a school. There is literally zero evidence of any political motivation here. That&#39;s the fact. The only recent shooting that I can think of that did have any clear political motivation was the congressional baseball shooting, and that was a liberal.</p>

<p>Regardless, you&#39;re missing my point. The problem isn&#39;t toxic conservatism. Or toxic liberalism. The fucking problem toxic partisanism. The problem is division and demonetization of the other side. Which you&#39;re guilty of right now.  If all you want to do is rail against conservatives, go back to r/politics. In this sub we should be able to discuss what&#39;s wrong with both parties.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People here, generally speaking, are critical thinkers.  The first reported photo of the kid I saw consisted of a screen grab of Isis photos.  My first thought wasn&#39;t damn these Isis ruffians, it was who has an interest in pinning this crime on Isis.  Logically, then, when I saw the Trump hat I had the same thought.  Just as if he had an I&#39;m With Hillary shirt on or a Feel the Bern tattoo on his ass. </p>

<p>I can&#39;t come close to the idea that a photo of someone wearing a certain hat merits significant discussion, I need more than a MAGA hat to make that connection.  Just like I needed more than a screen grab to blame Isis.  </p>

<p>You are allowed to talk about whatever you want here, by the way, thats what makes this place great, but keep in mind that what makes this sub great is if your talking point is a hat people will demand more evidence.  </p>
