    <div class="md"><p>It was very odd. My mom works there and she said the administration was very vague about it. The story is that this morning, a janitor or heard a cell phone alarm going off in hallway where it was plugged in charging. He picked it up, shut off the alarm, and apparently there was either a website or a note on on the phone describing the layout of the school and descriptions of assault rifles. It’s weird. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That makes me think it was intentionally left with the alarm set, to be found, and get the school locked down.<br/>
Smart kid if true, because they didn&#39;t make any actual threats. I wonder if it was really the school&#39;s layout, or if they covered their ass (assuming my intuition is right) by using one of the <em>many</em> available videogame maps, like halo, which also has a weapon specifically called the &quot;assault rifle&quot;. That would make it easily explainable by the student as a coincidental misunderstanding. I could be (and probably am) <em>way</em> overthinking this though.</p>

<p>Dear XXSD community member,</p>

<p>This morning, XXXXXXX police responded to XXXXXXXXX Elementary School for a report of a suspicious person attempting to gain unauthorized entry into the building. Due to the security measures in place, he was not able to gain entry and was apprehended a short distance away by the police. Students and staff are no longer in danger.</p>

<p>Police are investigating and will release further details as they become available. As we learn more, we will share additional information with you.</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>xxxxxxxxx</p>

<p>Superintendent of Schools</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I live in a fairly rural area, and we&#39;ve had numerous lockdowns in pretty much every nearby high school, as well as high schools in the surrounding areas. There has been an overwhelming police presence due to these alleged threats. Including bomb threats. Three juveniles were actually arrested at my local high school last week. A school officer claimed to have heard them discussing plans to shoot up the school, with the officer in earshot. Which made me side eye the situation a little bit. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on, but I&#39;m intrigued. In the past, it was &quot;normal&quot; to have maybe one school shooting threat in my area, usually after a major shooting occurred. I&#39;ve never seen this many threats in such a small period of time, though. Or this many lockdowns, let alone such a huge police presence. Is it just mass hype, or potentially some sort of bigger conspiracy to start rolling in higher security in schools? I can&#39;t help but wonder and speculate. </p>
