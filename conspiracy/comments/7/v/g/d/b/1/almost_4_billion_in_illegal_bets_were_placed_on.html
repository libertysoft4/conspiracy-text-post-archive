Absolutely astonishing to me that it’s not even a topic of political discussion when we have these massive deficits why are we not going after every penny we can?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not legal nationally because nobody can agree on how to split profits. The NBA came out in support of legalization recently and even proposed a plan to make it work. They also asked for 1% of all profits. Yeah it&#39;s only 1% but that&#39;s more than those in charge want to give up. And what happens when the NFL wants it&#39;s share? Other sports will want a cut too. </p>

<p>More people and more money would be gambled but places like Vegas would suffer from exclusivity. Those in charge of casinos in Vegas not only have power in the city, but all over the country when it comes to gambling. </p>

<p>From wikipedia on Boston Tea Party</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Colonists objected to the Tea Act because they believed that it violated their rights as Englishmen to &quot;No taxation without representation&quot;, that is, to be taxed only by their own elected representatives and not by a British parliament in which they were not represented. </p>

No, it&#39;s not automatically theft. That&#39;s like saying government is automatically tyrannical. If the gov steals your tax money for corporate profit, cronyism, corruption, war, rip off services, etc. then it is indeed theft. But when you use it for things the people need, it&#39;s cost effective and ethical (e.g. healthcare done right, not Obamacare/GOP alternatives, they&#39;re both utter shit compared to socialized single payer healthcare). 
Clearly the ratio of good social programs to bad/corrupted social programs is pretty low in the U.S. right now. Let&#39;s not oversimplify shit. </p>

<p>Obviously the elites want us to believe tax is theft so that they have an excuse to remove social programs and let the poor die while the super rich make profits. 
A takes a super rich person waaaaay longer to use a significant % of their wealth compared to poor/working/middle class people. </p>

<p>Zero taxation = accumulation of wealth barely ever re-circulates in the economy = massive POWER at the hands of a few and economic stagnation. Wealth = power in this world. Seriously, we need to stop thinking the world is black and white and stupidly simple as portrayed in the lying corporate media that spouts horseshit like &quot;you&#39;re either liberal or conservative or Democrat or Republican&quot; what bullshit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The guy replying to you....don&#39;t you get what he&#39;s trying to say?
If it was as simple as paying $2K for the ultimate freedom....</p>

<p>It&#39;s not that simple, zero or extremely low taxes is not going to fix your problems. Unless you were super wealthy yourself (and unethical). A privatized system is vastly more expensive due to profiteering motives. Governmental doctors + regulated pharma company drug prices in single payer healthcare is cheaper than the Obamacare/GOP &quot;for profit!&quot; models. </p>

<p>Sometimes humans need to come together for a common goal instead of being lone wolves all the time. Many advancements would not have been possible with survival of the fittest type mentalities. Team work made humanity. Collectivism has its place in society just as individualism does.
(By the way, individualism and individuality are two different things).</p>

<p>We have a very corrupt model of taxation but it doesn&#39;t mean
all taxation is bad. Similarly there&#39;s both good (worker rights, environment protections, etc.) and bad regulations (crony capitalist contracts, lobbying/bribery, authoritarianism, etc.).</p>

<p>Just saying.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that no all taxation is bad, but the very idea of taxing someone&#39;s labor is offensive to everything I, along with many others, believe in. Some taxes are voluntary, and most of those I can understand and agree with. </p>

<p>Given that a significant portion of income tax revenue goes directly to the fed reserve, and other ridiculous wastes of our money, it&#39;s mind boggling to me how anyone could ever support such lunacy . </p>

<p>It&#39;s easy for people to be compassionate with other people&#39;s money, I&#39;m of the mindset that people should only be compassionate with their own wallet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know you have a moral problem with compulsory taxation but you would have
an even greater moral issue with corporations/super rich getting away with controlling nearly all wealth unethically. Let alone the fact crony corporations didn&#39;t get to where they are by 100% honest and ethical means (unfair cronyist contracts, unethically low wages, mafia intimidating worker unions, tax dodging, moving jobs to poorer countries to exploit even harder just for a bit more profit, wasting resources, dumping toxic crap and even in flouride in our toothpaste, etc.). We should feel sorry for the common man, my friend. Not the super wealthy. The imaginary gun to the head argument can be used for generic crimes too but because the alternative is far more unethical, we have to compromise via reasonable taxation (based on income level) + 
non-corrupt social programs. Sadly we don&#39;t have this but you get my point.</p>

<p>If taxes weren&#39;t compulsory, the super rich would 100% take extreme advantage of that. No way are most corporations/billionaires going to give charity honestly and consistently. Even many current &quot;philanthropists&quot; (Rothschilds, Bill Gates, etc.) are just tax dodging phonies (or at best, donate little for PR and the rest for use of tax dodging/money laundering scams for their own benefit, robbing the country of much needed taxes despite being given the benefits of a tax-run society with roads, infrastructure, subsidies, etc.).</p>

<p>We need to remember that we (working/middle/upper middle class people) are not in the same group as the elites, even if you were an aspiring businessman. A businessman can be successful and still not play the same messed up games as the elites.
If they stop paying taxes, we&#39;re screwed and they&#39;re fine. If we stop paying taxes, they&#39;re still fine and we&#39;re still screwed. Average wealth people keeping a little more won&#39;t fix things compared to trying to remove corruption from our taxation/social program system + reasonable taxation. Charity can never be a replacement for tax just as voluntarily following the law is not practical vs enforcing it. Elites need to play by our rules rather than us play by their corrupt rules with loopholes. Elites won&#39;t be compassionate with their wallets so we have to even the playing field, tax them much more than lower tax brackets and remove the profiteering and cronyist elements of our social programs.</p>

<p>I&#39;m no expert on taxes but I agree with you about waste. Although, even corporate profiteering is a waste to us because it deprives us of real altruistic, cheap and efficient services (e.g. single payer instead of Obamacare/heavily privatized stuff). It&#39;s a huge damage to the economy and a waste in the sense that
most wealth is being enjoyed by the parasite elites.</p>

<p>Also, the super rich are far less likely to spend a decent % of their wealth in reasonable time compared to average wealth folk. So we really need the economy to have wealth circulating a bit more, in order to keep things moving smoothly and keeping everyone within a reasonable level of living standard (i.e. not struggling, being relatively happy and secure). The privately controlled FED is such a scam, I&#39;d rather nationalize it or get rid of it (after removing money from politics first, as well as getting rid of the treasonous CIA and secret societies). </p>

<p>I do think a huge amount of taxes is wasted/inefficient in serving the population. We can afford everything we need at a relatively low price compared to what we&#39;re getting for our taxes right now. I don&#39;t guarantee that taxes would eventually be very low from a decent non-corrupt tax/social program system, but definitely cheaper and worth it compared to what we have and far better than survival of the fittest type economics. I&#39;m just saying that some moderation is a good idea instead of extremes like corrupt cronyist tax vs zero/unreasonably low tax. I think the elites win in either of those extreme situations. The moderate solutions scare them because it reduces their power over us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Consider this angle: the elites can hoarde as much as they want with zero taxes. Is keeping a little more of your money really worth allowing the elites to be even more powerful? I know a lot of elites dodge tax but still, it&#39;s an important argument to consider.</p>

<p>Another angle: every worker contributes to the economy and deserves to be rewarded the fruits of their labor. In a capitalist society, (boss gets arbitrarily higher pay than all his employees) often the workers are ripped off and paid very low wages for their contribution. Taxation acts as a compensatory mechanism so that even if they&#39;re ripped off in wages, they can still be protected by the government by being provided essential services, which cost money, by means of reasonable taxation. A civilized nation requires taxation to treat the poor and common man with
healthcare, get the working man to work with cheap public transport, educate the population, make advancements in science, technology and medicine, etc.</p>

<p>I know, the taxation system in the U.S. is crappy (too much spent on cronyist corporately controlled privatized Obamacare and the military industrial complex-controlled military) but it doesn&#39;t represent all taxation just as the U.S. government doesn&#39;t represent all governments possible. We have a very crappy product when it comes to a &quot;democracy&quot;, a low quality expensive bootleg essentially (rigged DNC primaries, corporate media brainwashing, secret societies infiltrated government, etc.). We don&#39;t really get a say on what our taxes should go towards and how it&#39;s spent.
I want to contribute to taxes to help the people of the country but not warmonger bullshit, for example.</p>

<p>But if we got money out of politics, we could make healthcare cheaper in the long run. It would require a taxation system but a superior one to the current and recent taxation systems. E.g. Bernie&#39;s tax plan was not crazy at all and only an increase to significantly wealthier people (not that they&#39;d feel it that much anyway) but provide more efficient social programs free of corporate interference (except in the case of fairly regulated contracts, e.g. giving big pharma another chance, but with rules like no hiking up prices beyond X% profit margins, etc.)</p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/6RQTuWL.jpg">https://i.imgur.com/6RQTuWL.jpg</a></p>

<p>The corporations get free shit for themselves, it&#39;s about time
the people got their money&#39;s worth when it comes to their taxes.</p>

<p>Historical taxes:</p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/0LRy74l.jpg">https://i.imgur.com/0LRy74l.jpg</a></p>

<p>Taxes went down dramatically since Reagan onwards and this meant
less money from the super rich was going into social programs. This is the NEOliberal strategy pushed by the elites. Dems and Repubs were less retarded decades ago but somehow they convinced the people that cutting taxes for the super rich would cause a wealth trickle effect onto the poor/working/middle class but clearly that was a lie as 30 or so years later, here we are with the gap between the richest and poorest even more insane. The middle class is shrinking. Reaganomics/trickle down is a scam.</p>

<p>You&#39;re probably working or middle class so the little you gain in tax cuts
is not worth the damage being done to the economy (lack of affordable social programs = stagnating economy for the average Joe and lack of opportunities and innovation).</p>

<p>Think about the FAR bigger damage caused by the super rich hoarding all that wealth.
There&#39;s like $13 trillion in tax havens worldwide and yet the world still has mass poverty, hunger, wars for profit, etc. so it doesn&#39;t make sense to award the super rich elite bastards tax breaks when they do this type of shit. </p>

<p>Plan of action: get money out of politics so the government stops being corrupt (we may have to campaign to drain the swamp in terms of secret societies/CIA, etc. too) 
and then close the legal tax dodging loopholes, nationalize the federal reserve so the Rothschilds lose their power over our currency, etc.
When people pool together their resources, they can afford amazing things at more reasonable prices. I don&#39;t think we&#39;d have the internet if it weren&#39;t for tax funded social programs. There is certainly a benevolant side to taxation but the elites have corrupted it with cronyism/corporatism. If you had to privately pay the police/fire brigade/roads/schools/etc. every time, man that would be impractical and quickly escalate to corporate bullshit like ISPs pushing social network packages and throttling speeds lol. </p>
