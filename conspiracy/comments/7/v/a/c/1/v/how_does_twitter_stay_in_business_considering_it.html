<p>(<a href="http://money.cnn.com/2016/03/21/technology/twitter-10th-anniversary/index.html">http://money.cnn.com/2016/03/21/technology/twitter-10th-anniversary/index.html</a>)</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t that unusual. Google&#39;s only profitable venture is Google Search. Everything else, including YouTube, bleeds money. So when people have no problem with censorship on these platforms I don&#39;t think they fully understand the situation.</p>

<p>Also, why are they still around if they just lose their investor&#39;s money? Unless.......</p>

    <div class="md"><p>reddit is the biggest work of all time. Well maybe not the biggest but it&#39;s up there.</p>

<p>&quot;What if we made a website, that looked like it was user content, but it was really advertisements masquerading as people posting interesting stuff. I mean for anyone to even consider paying us for this service though we would have to make sure there was some system in place that we controlled to push the purchased ads above all the actual user generated comments. </p>

<p>Plus, once we get this set up, we can make it look like the website was &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;never profitable&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot; to begin with. That should save us quite a bit on taxes, eh?&quot;</p>

<p>Previously, two Russian state entities closely linked with the Kremlin - Gazprom Investholding and VTB Bank - had funded investment vehicles associated with Milner (DST USA II and DST Investments 3) to take stakes in Silicon Valley giants.</p>

<p>The investment in Twitter by DST Investments 3 was part-funded with $191m from VTB in 2011. The stake was sold about six months after Twitter floated on the stock market, returning a profit of $240m.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You gotta believe. </p>

<p>But really, just like most tech unicorns, including FB account fudginess, it is sustained by massive investments and the hope of these investors into being on the &quot;next big thing&quot;. The expectation is that, in the future, these companies will eventually turn out a profit, bad become the future Google, Microsoft or Apple. </p>

<p>What really buoyed all this was almost a decade of QE and ZIRP. The stock market has been a giant bubble since the Lehman crash. So with an abundance of easy cash, all this &quot;nonsense&quot; has perpetuated for this long. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>twitter is a tool for top down information control using appeals to popularity. it wasn&#39;t envisioned as such but it&#39;s definitely taken on that form now</p>

<p>the thing that made me realize that almost everything on the platform is completely made up was james comey having nearly a million likes and retweets and follows on his tweets about FISA and yet i didn&#39;t see a single tweet response that wasn&#39;t ripping that guy a new asshole. supposedly hundreds of thousands of people agree with him enough to like his tweet and yet none of them left a comment? those numbers had to be entirely fabricated or they&#39;re bots liking tweets but.. that&#39;s a much more troubling explanation for their business model.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look at uber as another example - despite delivering a physical service, they lose massive amounts of money every quarter.  Their investors are ok with this because they hope uber will one day completely monopolize the “taxi” market and become incredibly profitable.  Not how I would choose to spend my money, but it’s not an irrational strategy.</p>

<p>This is arguably a conspiracy, but not in the way you described.  It’s pretty unfair that Uber has so much private equity money that they can afford to operate at a loss until every independent cab has gone out of business, but that doesn’t mean they’re a sinister front for something.  Same logic applies to the tech companies you mentioned.  The conspiracy is that they’re so rich they can operate at a loss until we’re completely addicted to them, at which point they’ll try to make back all that money. </p>

<p>Welcome to late capitalism, where Silicon Valley will throw billions of dollars behind any half baked idea and let tech bros burn it for years, but the rest of us can’t get a loan to start a small business. </p>

<p>&#39;elon musk is going to save humanity with awesome technology&#39; is just marketing. realizing that tesla is lying about their numbers threatens the idea so people don&#39;t want to admit it</p>

<p>every single sales figure chart is like this. it appears that tesla is doing insanely well but they have framed the comparison in such a manner that they win the race before it starts

<ol>
<li>they are counting worldwide tesla sales and US for the rest. that means that it&#39;s not a fair comparison</li>
<li>teslas are rounded figures. the other ones are... rougher. are they estimates or reported numbers?</li>
<li>are these physical deliveries or just sales figures? do pre-orders count in this? </li>

<p>you&#39;re telling me that tesla motors was able to rapidly outpace multinational corporations that have been selling cars since the dawn of modern industry with high end luxury automobiles</p>

Anyone remember Nuffrespects channel with the 911 videos. Even with them manipulating view counts he was probably hitting 10 million on some stuff. 
I still spend a lot of time there for news clips, conspiracy analysis and documentaries and live music. 
The amount of channels that were shut down I don&#39;t know but it was probably thousands. I had 600 videos. Political confrontations I did. Short documentaries.

<p>In one video he asserts missiles cannot fly in level flight because he doesn’t understand basic physics, is proven wrong in the comments, makes a video pretending to admit wrong and then concludes he should just keep his material behind a paywall.

His own theory is based on drawings, misunderstanding if basic physics and conjecture and it seems like the only proof he might accept is if someone strapped him to a missle and fired him from a fighter jet. Then when he got called out on it made another video where he pretended to retract his first video, then doubled down and decided it best he stay behind his pay wall.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;...he asserts missiles cannot fly in level flight because he doesn&#39;t understand basic physics...&quot;</p>

<p>Assuming we are talking about old fashioned or wingless missles (where it&#39;s basically just an explosive rocket with guidance fins as opposed to a modern winged flying drone with built in warhead type missile), can missiles actually maintain level flight? I thought gravitational pull was always a consideration when calculating trajectories and what not because the only thing generating lift on a missile is the propulsion system? I googled &quot;Can missiles maintain level flight?&quot; and got all kinds of non-related stuff about aircrafts and pilot manuevers and such. Thanks in advance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Basically aside from cruise missiles which have winglets or lifting bodies like the LRSM most missiles use vectored thrust, control surfaces, or tines to slightly point the nose of the missile upwards so that some part of the thrust vector counteracts gravity while the control surfaces or directed thrust keep the nose of the missile pointed upwards. </p>

<p>So this is not terribly efficient but it helps with aerodynamics and maneuverability. Long range missiles like the LRSM were efficiency is more of a priority have mechanisms to generate lift but they are subsonic and very long range. Ballistic missiles rely on a ballistic or orbital trajectory for efficiency. </p>

<p>He doesn&#39;t believe modern anti air/ ground/ ship missles can exist because they don&#39;t generate enough lift... send him videos of these missiles in flight and papers on missle theory and he yells at you about primary sources. </p>

<p>also, those businesses cost basically nothing to run. you have the labor of maybe 3-4 people and almost all of your expenses are the lease payment/utilities, they figure they&#39;d lose more money from the psychological impact of an empty storefront than paying three teenagers minimum wage to sell candles</p>

Two of them in fact were losing money for years (this did not go over well when I asked basic questions about their overhead and sales as a fellow business owner)but run by wives of rich men.

They go to the Chamber meetings socialize etc....Just a hobby no differen than paying for a club membership somewhere...</p>

<p>NOW, a furniture shop and a few others I determined were without question front companies for drugs, money laundering or any number of possible things.

    <div class="md"><p>Without knowledge of their exact history, accounting and tax code.<br/>
Mom and pop small brick and mortar owner here.  From the viewpoint of the cash register and checkbook, I make a decent profit at the end of the year. 
After I do taxes, I’ve been loosing 300-10000 a year.  I think the biggest loophole is the personal vehicle deduction.  I pay for gas out of my own pocket, but get to take the base deduction per mile.  That changes my situation by $3000 a year.  There are other capital improvements and repairs that help. (New 13k hvac this year) that offset profits.  </p>

If it is then isn&#39;t the government supporting a monopoly? Shouldn&#39;t someone be able to start their own version of these companies to compete in the free market and also be eligible for government funding? If not then wouldn&#39;t that hypothetical start-up have a viable suit against the government for only supporting monopolies?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s basically a giant (legal) Ponzi scheme.
They keep taking more and more venture capital to cover costs. As more and more capital has been injected, new valuations go up, which in turn lires in even more venture capital. </p>

<p>It&#39;s pretty insane.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not that difficult to generate lots of users with a free product. The difficult part is to make money on it.</p>

<p>Personally I think it&#39;s like a bubble, like bubbles in the financial markets, except just for a single company. Each business, youtube, twitter, uber and so on are individual bubbles. They will burst eventually.</p>
