        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>SS: The sky in Asheville NC has been increasingly littered with trails- grids, Xs, tartan plaids of trails, whether cold or mild out. Make of that what you will. Tomorrow suddenly we&#39;re set to have abnormal winter storms. The timing of a sky full of trails consistently proceeds dramatic weather changes here. 
While I&#39;m uncertain if trails carry agents that keep us sick, dumbed down or tired, evidence increasingly shows that weather manipulation via controlled aerial release is real. </p>

<p>First pic, close up of &#39;plaid&#39; parallel and crossing lines forming a weave of man-made clouds over the center of town. This is more air traffic than comes and goes in the morning hours from our tiny airport. The pattern seems almost insultingly intentional.</p>

<p>I was on the south end of town, at the edge of today&#39;s grid- and the sky toward the center of town was so tight with rows and grid work of trails that the camera can&#39;t make them out, but I could- and had I traveled deeper into town today I could have taken shots of life directly under the massive grid. </p>

<p>Closeup:</p>

<p>And finally, the sky over the actual airport- devoid of trails.</p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/5dXpWLH">http://imgur.com/5dXpWLH</a></p>

<p>And to answer how a single plane can produce that much cloud there&#39;s this video of a much smaller truck that&#39;s maybe 1/3 or 1/4 the size of a commercial size jet that&#39;s creating a mountain sized cloud seemingly out of nowhere:</p>

<p>When did they admit to chem trailing under the guise of geoengineering? We occasionally do cloud seeding here in the US, but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s done by the government.  </p>

</blockquote>

<p>As I already explained, it depends on atmospheric conditions, which depends on a lot of things. Altitude is a big factor. If one plane is 10,000ft above another, one may form them, and the other may not. They don&#39;t magically turn on/off either.</p>

<p>The only thing that requires magic to explain is chemtrails. Where would you fit the absolutely gigantic amount of material required to leave a massive chemtrail several miles long inside an aircraft?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Doesn&#39;t sound like just farmers to me:</p>

<p>&quot;In the past five years since 2007, billionaire Bill Gates has spent at least $5 million on geoengineering research and cloud-seeding in Africa alone due to severe shortages of clean water and food. But, the droughts are ‘worse than ever.’</p>

<p>Raytheon, a private defense contractor, is working with Gates and others “to reduce global warming” through stratospheric seeding with aluminum oxide particles, those nasty ‘CHEMTRAILS’ that we frequently see in our skies. They want to create what they call “smart clouds” through nonotechnology.</p>

<p>But, what worries this climatologist is the ‘chaff pollution’ that this high-altitude spraying has produced during the past several years.&quot;</p>

<p>AND</p>

<p>&quot;Among the substances found to be in recent laboratory soils in central Iowa were several that should simply not be there: 6 bacteria, including anthrax and pneumonia, 9 chemicals, including acetylcholine chloride, 26 heavy metals including arsenic, gold, lead, mercury, silver, uranium and zinc, 4 molds and fungi, 7 viruses, 2 cancers, 2 vaccines and 2 sedatives.</p>

<p>Over the last several months, many senators and congressmen have received a significant increase in chemtrail-related calls and letters. Most report a dramatic increase in chemtrail ‘spraying’ activity in their areas. Some are reporting the development of chronic flu-like symptoms, chronic fatigue and body aches that they have never before experienced. My wife Sharon, normally very healthy, is currently experiencing all of these symptoms as our many others in the region. Are these normal spring allergies? I think not.</p>

<p>Also, just this week, an airline pilot called to tell me, “Cliff, we pilots see these jet tankers dumping chemtrails almost every day. We’re told that it’s ‘a priority military project.’”</p>

<p>While I’m on the subject of ‘Chemtrails,’ farmers in some parts of the Midwest have been forced to spend $40 or more per acre on lime applications to combat the surprisingly high amounts of aluminum oxide in their soils. Confirming this on Friday, according our Kansas correspondent, Ed Petrowsky, the well-respected commodity advisory service, ‘Crop Quest,’ reported that aluminum levels across most of the Midwest have ‘DOUBLED’ in the past 3-5 years. They also added, that it must have come from the air. It didn’t leach up from the ground. So, I guess that two and two still makes four. Also on Friday, Greg Koch of Coeur d’Alene, informed me that there was a recent Chemtrail and Geoengineering Symposium held on the island of Maui on April 27 to discuss the lack of normal plant growth on the island.</p>

<p>The geoengineers are ‘playing with fire,’ and we’re ‘getting burned.’&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;BISMARCK, N.D. (AP) — North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum is pushing for a comprehensive study of cloud seeding over complaints from farmers and ranchers that the practice may be making drought conditions worse.</p>

<p>The Bismarck Tribune reports that Burgum told a meeting of the state Water Commission that a lot of people think the commission is using old and insufficient data to support the program. One of those studies was conducted between 1969 and 1972.</p>

<p>Six counties and a portion of a seventh participate in the state&#39;s weather modification program, which seeds clouds with silver iodide to suppress hail and increase rainfall.</p>

<p>The budget for the cloud seeding program is about $1 million for 2017, with one-third coming from the state and two-thirds from participating counties.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/north-dakota/articles/2017-08-24/governor-asks-for-study-on-disputed-cloud-seeding-program">https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/north-dakota/articles/2017-08-24/governor-asks-for-study-on-disputed-cloud-seeding-program</a></p>

<p>And from the US Gov. itself:</p>

<p>&quot;Stratospheric Welsbach seeding for reduction of global warming </p>

<p>Abstract</p>

<p>A method is described for reducing atmospheric or global warming resulting from the presence of heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere, i.e., from the greenhouse effect. Such gases are relatively transparent to sunshine, but absorb strongly the long-wavelength infrared radiation released by the earth. The method incudes the step of seeding the layer of heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere with particles of materials characterized by wavelength-dependent emissivity. Such materials include Welsbach materials and the oxides of metals which have high emissivity (and thus low reflectivities) in the visible and 8-12 micron infrared wavelength regions.&quot;</p>

<p>I&#39;m not entire sure what you think the rest of your comment is doing. As I said, cloud seeding is public knowledge. We know when it&#39;s being done.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good job ignoring everything else I posted. Cloud seeding is the known term. You said only farmers do it but I proved you wrong. In fact, the other articles I posted which you ignored show that farmers are alarmed about the numerous heavy metals accumulating in the soil from the cloud seeding programs, so much so that the Governor of North Dakota was investigating it. You are naive if you believe cloud seeding is only to control drought. That is what is called a &quot;cover story&quot; genius.</p>

<p>&quot;No, it&#39;s not. It&#39;s completely different. Cloud seeding is done publicly, and it&#39;s not done by the government. It&#39;s done by private farmers, generally in drought stricken areas.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is this real enough?</p>

<p>&quot;Cold-weather seeding is done at the core of snow clouds that can reach altitudes as high as 60,000 feet: Flares filled with tiny flakes of silver iodide are ejected into the clouds’ centers. Silver iodide has a molecular structure similar to that of ice. As the silver particles drift down through the clouds, water gloms onto them as it would to ice, and snowflakes grow.</p>

<p>This method is also routinely used for mitigating hail storms, especially in Canada: When silver iodide particles are injected into a hail-producing storm cloud, there are suddenly more nuclei for the ice to cling to. Smaller ice pellets, or “graupel,” form rather than large hail stones.</p>

<p>Silver iodide in large concentrations can be harmful, but the concentrations found in snowpack after cloud seeding are often so low as to be undetectable. Breed’s NCAR study in Wyoming found that there was less silver iodide in snow and soil samples in areas where clouds had been seeded than there had been before the campaigns—either due to fluctuations in naturally occurring levels of silver iodide or because the extra water released by the seeding flushed the system.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Silver Iodide, as stated in the article, is a harzardous chemical being sprayed in cloud seeding programs. Farmers are finding unnaturally increased heavy metals in their soil.</p>

<p>&quot;The harmful effects of silver iodide are insidious.(3) Yet, according to the web site of the PGCD, the effects are so minimized that the following is stated: “The concentration of iodide in iodized salt used on food is far above the concentration found in rainwater from a seeded cloud.”(4) In addition, in early December of 2002, at the Amarillo meeting jointly conducted by the Panhandle Groundwater and the North Plains Groundwater Conservation Districts, one representative stated that silver iodide was good for the heart. In a private conversation, another explained that silver miners live longer. Iodized salt may seem benign; however, some states such as Colorado have outlawed the use of salting icy roads.(5) Among harmful effects, salt is toxic to the water and land.(5)</p>

<p>The Office of Environment, Health and Safety, UC Berkeley, rates silver iodide as a Class C, non-soluble, inorganic, hazardous chemical that pollutes water and soil.(8) It has been found to be highly toxic to fish, livestock and humans.(6,7,8,9) Numerous medical articles demonstrate that humans absorb silver iodide through the lungs, nose, skin, and GI tract.(7,8,9) Mild toxicity can cause GI irritation, renal and pulmonary lesions, and mild argyria (blue or black discoloration of the skin). Severe toxicity can result in hemorrhagic gastroenteritis, shock, enlarged heart, severe argyria, and death by respiratory depression.(8)</p>

<p>Moreover, a key manufacturer of silver iodide for weather modification, Deepwater Chemicals, warns of potential health effects of silver iodide in their Material Safety Data Sheet as follows:</p>

<p>Chronic Exposure/Target Organs:    Chronic ingestion of iodides may produce “iodism”, which may be manifested by skin rash, running nose, headache and irritation of the mucous membranes. Weakness, anemia, loss of weight and general depression may also occur. Chronic inhalation or ingestion may cause argyria characterized by blue-gray discoloration of the eyes, skin and mucous membranes. Chronic skin contact may cause permanent discoloration of the skin.(10)&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ranches.org/cloudseedingharmful.htm">http://www.ranches.org/cloudseedingharmful.htm</a></p>

<p>&quot;Artificial weather modification through the use of chemicals can impact us by reducing water supplies, causing dry snows, less rainfall, changing agricultural crop production cycles, reducing crop production, and water availability. Since most experimental weather modification programs use chemicals released into the atmosphere the public could be subjected increasingly toxic or unknown substances that could adversely impact agricultural crops and trees, not to mention our personal health. Global dimming and persistent contrails and chemtrails that produce man-made clouds, may have serious impacts on crop production, trees in our forests, and our trees on our private property, and Idaho’s Whitebark Pine. The dead and dying trees all around us are being attacked by beetles, and we have a tender box sitting waiting for the lighting strike to ignite and off she burns. I wonder at the governments answer all the time, well huh, its the beetles, and lack of moisture. Well did any of you brilliant government stooges do any soil testing for chemicals, like barium and or other chemical man made agents, gather some ring samples maybe, how about a water sample in these area’s, Never mind, I think I will get some samples myself for my own documentation, never needed you guys any way.</p>

<p>This same agronomist seemed unable to give a simple, direct answer to my question of what is considered to be the traditional historical background level of naturally occurring aluminum in agricultural soils although one page on the web site of his laboratory had the following statement along with an illustration with specific figures: &quot;Aluminum greater than 400 ppm is a problem for most growing plants.  The primary target for aluminum is the root cap.  Therefore, it has a major impact on root growth and efficiency.&quot;
 
<a href="http://stopsprayingcalifornia.com/Contaminated-Soil-&amp;amp;-Chemtrails.html">http://stopsprayingcalifornia.com/Contaminated-Soil-&amp;amp;-Chemtrails.html</a></p>

<p>&quot;The aluminum reading that had been reported in our ten local soil tests ranged from a high of 1692 ppm (parts per million) to a low of 712 ppm - and that lowest one happened to be the Holmestead field.  The average of all ten fields was 1247 ppm which is in the &quot;Very High&quot; range of the above published Aluminum Rating.
 
Our interest in the level of aluminum is related to the fact that there have been numerous reports of various aluminum compounds being found in the &quot;chemtrails&quot; that are being constantly sprayed.  Just search Google for chemtrails + aluminum or aluminium: Google search- the list of results is extensive!&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Contrails last as long as conditions allow. Jet fuel is very similar to paraffin (kerosene); it is a hydrocarbon - a complex mix of carbon and hydrogen. When it burns in air it breaks apart and the carbon combines with oxygen to expand into carbon dioxide gas (CO2) and the hydrogen combines with oxygen to form water (H2O). These two reactions give off a great deal of heat energy. 1 kilo of aviation fuel combines with oxygen to produce about 3.5 kilos of CO2 gas and 1.2 kilos of water which boils instantly into 1,600 litres of superheated steam. It is these rapidly expanding hot gases which push the aircraft forward. At high altitudes where the temperature is minus 50 degrees the steam will freeze into tiny ice crystals almost instantly. If the air is dry the crystals will disappear in seconds through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sublimation_(phase_transition">sublimation</a>, but if the air is saturated with water vapour then the crystals will grow many times in size into snowflakes through the opposite process called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deposition_(phase_transition">deposition</a> and can last for hours or even days in a distinct formation. This is a contrail. It does not require any sinister chemicals to make it form. How long a contrail lasts depends on temperature, pressure, and humidity, and nothing else. A 747 burns around 11 tons of fuel per hour, which convert to around 13 tons of ice, which is around 24 kg per mile. It is a tiny amount compared with the thousands of tons of ice in a contrail, but only 0.003% of the water in a persistent contrail comes from the burnt fuel; the other 99.997% is from the atmosphere itself. It&#39;s not hard to see how a jet liner spewing fire and ice can leave a huge spectacular cloud behind it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Normal airplanes often fly approximately the same route every day, at the same times. Their contrails look like white smoke stripes, like the exhaust fumes of cars in cold air. Chemtrails, however, are often secreted in dense, sometimes lumpy, stripes. On spray days you&#39;ll see the most bizarre flights appear in the air (1), which sometimes include six or seven planes at the same time (2). Sometimes they fly parallel to each other, sometimes they make curves, or they suddenly stop producing a stripe or start making one.</p>

<p>Chemtrail debunkers claim that the chemtrails are simply frozen plane tracks, but they can&#39;t explain why normal planes flying through that same air at the same time don&#39;t leave any tracks at all. They also can&#39;t answer the question why this phenomenon has only been seen since halfway through the nineties and often can&#39;t be seen at all in thinly populated areas (sometimes with far colder air).</p>

<p>&quot;With the jet engines of nowadays it&#39;s almost impossible to form a persistent contrail. You need unique atmospheric conditions for that. First, the airplane needs to be above 30,000 feet. The temperatures have to be below minus 40 degrees Celsius, and you have to have a relative air humidity of 67 percent. But that&#39;s hardly ever the case. So what you see today, with the whole spectrum from the horizon filled with contrails from planes flying at different altitudes, is impossible. That&#39;s science. So there must be another reason for it.&quot; - Willem Felderhof, former KLM pilot (3)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh my.... what a lot of mistakes to correct.....</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sometimes they fly parallel to each other, sometimes they make curves</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Air corridors are busy. Often there&#39;s a plane along one every five minutes. If the plane in front is leaving a contrail, the following pilot will fly to one side of it to avoid turbulence and loss of visibility. So, parallel contrails, or more. Planes sometimes fly in lazy circles or ovals in a <a href="https://imgur.com/4wBcsWy">holding pattern</a> while they wait to be slotted in to the landing queue.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>they suddenly stop producing a stripe or start making one.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Flying through bands of dry and wet air. If you could see variations in humidity the sky would look like a marble cake. Very chaotic.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>normal planes flying through that same air at the same time don&#39;t leave any tracks at all</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You sure they are at the same altitude? It&#39;s almost impossible to guess, so I always use <a href="https://www.flightradar24.com/">Flightradar24</a> to find out. Facts; much better than opinions.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>this phenomenon has only been seen since halfway through the nineties</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What crap. How old are you? I&#39;ve been &#39;Looking up&#39; and seeing them since the 1950s, and the first contrail was observed in 1922. They were a serious problem for <a href="https://imgur.com/YK8UBB6">US bomber crews</a> in WWII because they pointed straight at the bombers.</p>

<p>And your last quote is pure bullshit. I used to be an aircraft engineer working on gas turbines. I can assure you that high bypass engines produce MORE contrail because of the pressure waves inside the outer turbine casing. Felderhof was a former pilot who was grounded after becoming mentally ill, which he claims was due to toxic fumes in the cabin.</p>

<p>Commercial planes take the most economical flight path to not waste gas, they don&#39;t fly winding paths mid flight around other planes doing the same thing whilst creating zig-zagging and circular/spiraling patterns.</p>

<p>I can tell you I have never been on (or known anyone) who has taken a flight going on the paths of &quot;contrails&quot; like these:</p>

Figure out how to copy/paste sources and cite them in your comments old timer and maybe you will have better luck with future discussions. Oh, and maybe buy a pair of reading glasses while you are at it so you can actually read the articles given to you as sources of evidence instead of copping out because it is too inconvenient. If you want to be taken seriously, put in the work and back up your claims with more than your own opinions and then sticking your head in the sand when evidence counter to your own perception of reality is presented to you.

These new ones that started appearing around the 2000s are these gigantic wide trails that linger on and a huge storm or freezing weather always follows them.

<p>There&#39;s actually a video shot by a drone of an unmarked white van parked in the middle an uninhabited marsh- with a military escort- that produces COPIOUS amounts of &#39;fog&#39; that rises up into the air and becomes a cloud as the drone flys away and records. It&#39;s stunning. This one tiny van has some kind of super condensed material and a means to release it so fast that it becomes as big as a mountain.

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>How does a small amount of jet exhaust (from a finite amount of fuel) reacting to the cool air create such a disproportionate and exponential amount of trail?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here you go.... My stock answer: Contrails last as long as conditions allow. Jet fuel is very similar to paraffin (kerosene); it is a hydrocarbon - a complex mix of carbon and hydrogen. When it burns in air it breaks apart and the carbon combines with oxygen to expand into carbon dioxide gas (CO2) and the hydrogen combines with oxygen to form water (H2O). These two reactions give off a great deal of heat energy. 1 kilo of aviation fuel combines with oxygen to produce about 3.5 kilos of CO2 gas and 1.2 kilos of water which boils instantly into 1,600 litres of superheated steam. It is these rapidly expanding hot gases which push the aircraft forward. At high altitudes where the temperature is minus 50 degrees the steam will freeze into tiny ice crystals almost instantly. If the air is dry the crystals will disappear in seconds through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sublimation_(phase_transition">sublimation</a>, but if the air is saturated with water vapour then the crystals will grow many times in size into snowflakes through the opposite process called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deposition_(phase_transition">deposition</a> and can last for hours or even days in a distinct formation. This is a contrail. It does not require any sinister chemicals to make it form. How long a contrail lasts depends on temperature, pressure, and humidity, and nothing else. A 747 burns around 11 tons of fuel per hour, which convert to around 13 tons of ice, which is around 24 kg per mile. It is a tiny amount compared with the thousands of tons of ice in a contrail, but only 0.003% of the water in a persistent contrail comes from the burnt fuel; the other 99.997% is from the atmosphere itself. It&#39;s not hard to see how a jet liner spewing fire and ice can leave a huge spectacular cloud behind it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You actually provided no evidence debunking anything I said about NASA except Fail so good try. For starters:</p>

<p>&quot;In the video presentation below, NASA engineer Kelly Smith explains about many of the risks and pitfalls surrounding the new Orion Deep Space Mission to the planet Mars.</p>

<p>Surprisingly, chief among Kelly’s concerns is whether or not his spacecraft can successfully pass through the perilous Van Allen Radiation Belts. Such is the prospective danger in fact, that NASA will have to send a dumbie craft first in order to ‘test out’ what the potential radiation effects will be on future human crews, as well as on the ship’s delicate sensors and equipment.</p>

<p>Hold on. Why the guessing game by NASA? Why don’t they just use the same 1969 technology they are said to have used on the first Apollo moon missions?</p>

<p>SuperPerformance72 explains, “This video released by NASA about the upcoming Orion space exploration craft, shows a NASA scientist admitting that they still haven’t worked out how to properly shield the spacecraft from the radiation emitted from the Van Allen belts.”</p>

<p>This is the ultimate conspiracy, as it brings together two huge issues – the viability of the Apollo Moon Landings, as well as dreams of a human colony on Mars. This latest admission by NASA places both of these in jeopardy.&quot;</p>

<p>The story of the original Blue Marble (seems NASA says it was a real pic, not an artists rendition.</p>

<p>&quot;At five hours and a few minutes into the flight of Apollo 17 one of the crewmen looked out the window. What he saw inspired him to grab the only Hasselblad that wasn&#39;t stowed and snap a picture -- actually four pictures, no more than a minute apart, changing the exposure after the first one. The second snap yielded the sharper image that&#39;s become famous, so a minute&#39;s attention was involved. But whoever did it said nothing on the radio or to their crewmates about it. It&#39;s possible they did it instinctively, hardly thinking about it, because none of them thought to mention it for weeks.</p>

<p>It wasn&#39;t until the flight returned safely ten days later, and the film was processed at the photo lab in Building 8 of the Johnson Space Center, that a film technician named Dick Underwood realized what he was looking at: the first photograph of the whole, fully illuminated, astonishingly beautiful Earth. It created an immediate sensation, printed on the front page of nearly every newspaper on the planet, the image of our world as we had never seen it before.</p>

<p>The Earth was nearing winter solstice at the time so the South Pole was tilted sunward, cupping the planet in a clean white bowl. White clouds swirl north over deep blue oceans and the green middle of the African continent, then a tan arc caps the image with the dry lands of Arabia. All around this perfect colorful circle is blackness so dense it defines infinity. It&#39;s an unmistakable portrait of a living world and it is arresting.</p>

<p>(The true camera image is upside-down by earthly standards, showing the South Pole at the top of the globe, because the camera was held by a weightless man who didn&#39;t know down from up. Most reproductions invert it to align with our expectations.)&quot;</p>

<p>As for the chemtrails, you said they are easily explained but cannot provide the exact conditions needed for these long lasting miles long clouds to form. So yes I want specifics which you are unable to provide.

<p>Actually, that&#39;s not what he said at all. They said they are working on shielding for the more sensitive electronics. Apollo didn&#39;t really have sensitive electronics. They are not really all that worried about the astronauts radiation exposure from the belts, however they would like to limit it if possible. The bigger radiation problem comes from long term exposure in interplanetary space.    </p>

<p>Of course they are going to do a test before they send humans. You don&#39;t put humans on the first launch of a brand new rocket. That&#39;s fucking stupid.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The videos themselves are not backing up what they say with anything, so why should I? They are just making their own, skewed interpretation of the videos. I&#39;m offering a more obvious answer. If you want to google my point on the radiation thing, feel free.  </p>

<p>The original Blue Marble (as well as the others) are artist renderings passed off as real photos which you said was not the case. I showed you how NASA said it was an actual photo taken on Apollo 18 with the photographer unknown. They did not originally say it was an artist interpretation.  </p>

<p>But it&#39;s not an artists interpretation . <a href="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/622/21081863984_ba1ce8a857_k.jpg">Here</a> is the original image as it appears in the archive. NASA photo ID AS17-148-22727. There are several other identical photos in the album. Keep in mind, that version is a recent digital scan of the old image, so it looks a little different and I think they got some dust on the side there.    </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nope, it&#39;s fake. Here&#39;s some history for you: </p>

<p>&quot; As it turns out, much of what one might assume about this beautiful image is not true…. It isn’t actually a photograph of earth. And that blackness surrounding it? That’s not space, either….</p>

<p>Simmon, a data-visualizer and designer at NASA’s Earth Observatory, created the image in 2002. He told Quartz it’s not a photograph, but a sophisticated visualization. </p>

<p>Images of the earth may seem commonplace, but there are actually very few pictures of the entire planet. The problem, Simmon said, is all the NASA earth-observing satellites are in low-earth or geostationary orbit, meaning none of them are far enough away to see a full hemisphere. The most familiar pictures of the entire Earth are from the 1960s and 1970s Apollo missions to the moon.</p>

<p>As realistic as it looks, the image is a composite of four months of light data collected in 2,300 km (1,429 mi) wide bands as NASA’s Terra satellite orbited from pole to pole, and the earth rotated beneath it.</p>

<p>That data was then stitched togetherand applied to the surface of a digital ball, then modified in Photoshop.</p>

<p>Simmon readily admits there are numerous fakeries in his image. The atmosphere is Photoshop blur. Some of the clouds are collaged together using Photoshop’s clone tool to cover gaps in the satellite’s coverage. The black area around the earth is not the void of space. It is simply a background of black color that Simmon placed the earth on top of. (This is standard practice, Simmon says: most actual “photographs” of the earth—including the Apollo images—present the planet on a black background).</p>

<p>Without these alterations, the image wouldn’t look very earth-like.Simmon said he based his manipulations on reality, “in the sense that I’ve looked at a lot of imagery to see how thick should that be, how blue should that be.” But, he later added, “It’s more hyper-realistic than realistic.”</p>

<p><a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/aplanetruth.info/2017/03/14/nasas-blue-marble-earth-is-a-fake/amp/">https://www.google.com/amp/s/aplanetruth.info/2017/03/14/nasas-blue-marble-earth-is-a-fake/amp/</a></p>

<p>&quot;The image on the left, dated 1978, is actually a composite of images taken in 2001 and published on on February 8, 2002. You can find the original photo here, and the NASA page including a discussion of it here.</p>

<p>Below we have compared the alleged 1978 image (which we’ll now refer to as the 2001 image) with the original NASA photo. The original NASA image is on the left and the 2001 photo in circulation (mis-labeled as 1978) is on the right. It is clear that the colors have been altered from the original to appear more vibrant, and the subtle greens of the original are much brighter in the altered version.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But that&#39;s not the same blue marble. The one I linked is the original blue marble, NASA photo ID AS17-148-22727. That picture I linked is a digital scan of the original photo, and was released in the 1970s. I mean, the very page you linked says this.      </p>

<p>The fake one is newer released one, which is CG, and says as much. It was released in 2002. You&#39;re talking about a completely different image here. As I said, it says that one is fake right on the NASA website.    </p>

The evidence is numerous and not related to our original topic so I will leave it to you to research if you really want see the truth about the lies they have been peddling the past 50+ years.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure, you failed to prove I lied whereas I showed you your own words where you actually lied. Maybe you need to look up the definition of a liar. Oh wait, here it is:</p>

<p>li·ar</p>

<p>ˈlī(ə)r/</p>

<p>noun</p>

<p>a person who tells lies.</p>

<p>synonyms: deceiver, fibber, perjurer, false witness, fabricator, equivocator; More</p>

<p>You said the Goverment doesn&#39;t cloud seed while only farmers do. I proved you wrong and then you said you never said the Gov doesn&#39;t do cloud seeding. I showed you your own words where you said exactly that and you still have the nerve to call me a liar. Sounds like a perjury and fabricating if you ask me.</p>

<p>When you resort to name-calling, it shows you truly have no argument left to make, so as I said last night and again today, if you want an honest discussion, refrain from childish name-calling in the future. We are done here.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I said the government doesn&#39;t do cloud seeding in the US. You proceeded to link something that literally never said anywhere in it that the government does cloud seeding in the US as proof. <em>You</em> were the one that lied there.   </p>

<p>Lets go through some other times where you lied:  </p>

<p>In <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7v3aal/a_contrailtastic_day_in_north_carolina/dtplwlj/">this comment</a>, you claimed that NASA passed off the 2002 blue marble image as real. They never did, and even your own source shows that they didn&#39;t.  </p>

<p>In <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7v3aal/a_contrailtastic_day_in_north_carolina/dtpl4me/">this comment</a>, you claimed that the original blue marble image is fake. It&#39;s not, as I showed.  </p>

<p>In <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7v3aal/a_contrailtastic_day_in_north_carolina/dtpag79/">this comment</a> you claimed that we have never been past the Van Allen radiation belts. That is not true. In the same comment you also claimed that NASA uses wires in their ISS videos, and that air bubbles are seen floating in spacewalk videos. This is not true. You also claimed that all pictures of the earth are &quot;cgi composites&quot;, which is also not true. You also again claimed that the blue marble pics were passed of as real until NASA admitted they were fake, which is also not true.  </p>

<p>In <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7v3aal/a_contrailtastic_day_in_north_carolina/dtpe5wd/">this comment</a> you once again claimed that the original blue marble image is fake. It&#39;s not, as I demonstrated.  </p>

<p>So, you have failed to provide a single time when NASA lied, and thus you were also lying in <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7v3aal/a_contrailtastic_day_in_north_carolina/dtp9i2e/">this comment.</a>  </p>

<p>So yes, you are a liar. Stop lying. It looks bad.</p>

<p>How do you know they are at the same altitude?</p>

<p>Try looking at the plane on Flightradar.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>please explain what these perfect conditions are</p>

<p>Okay. Contrails last as long as conditions allow. Jet fuel is very similar to paraffin (kerosene); it is a hydrocarbon - a complex mix of carbon and hydrogen. When it burns in air it breaks apart and the carbon combines with oxygen to expand into carbon dioxide gas (CO2) and the hydrogen combines with oxygen to form water (H2O). These two reactions give off a great deal of heat energy. 1 kilo of aviation fuel combines with oxygen to produce about 3.5 kilos of CO2 gas and 1.2 kilos of water which boils instantly into 1,600 litres of superheated steam. It is these rapidly expanding hot gases which push the aircraft forward. At high altitudes where the temperature is minus 50 degrees the steam will freeze into tiny ice crystals almost instantly. If the air is dry the crystals will disappear in seconds through sublimation, but if the air is saturated with water vapour then the crystals will grow many times in size into snowflakes through the opposite process called deposition and can last for hours or even days in a distinct formation. This is a contrail. It does not require any sinister chemicals to make it form. How long a contrail lasts depends on temperature, pressure, and humidity, and nothing else. A 747 burns around 11 tons of fuel per hour, which convert to around 13 tons of ice, which is around 24 kg per mile. It is a tiny amount compared with the thousands of tons of ice in a contrail, but only 0.003% of the water in a persistent contrail comes from the burnt fuel; the other 99.997% is from the atmosphere itself. With an understanding of science, it&#39;s not hard to see how a jet liner spewing fire and ice can leave a huge spectacular cloud behind it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The temerature I gave was only an average. If you fly you&#39;ll see it vary from 46 to 56 below centigrade at cruising altitude, which could be between 28,000 and 40,000 feet. As an aircraft climbs it reaches an altitude where it is cold enough to form contrails. Whether it does, depends on how much water vapour there is in the air at that altitude. That varies a great deal. An aircraft at 25,000 feet could be making a spectacular contrail, while another at 30,000 is making none at all.</p>

<p>They do that, always have done. Persistent contrails usually happen when there is a cold front approaching. Whether a contrail forms, dissipates, or grows depends entirely on moisture levels, air pressure, and temperature.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, I&#39;m not gonna read through that. What is your point in trying to prove to me that geoengineering is real? I know it&#39;s real. What I&#39;m asking you to do is explain how any of this is responsible for the long white clouds coming out of airliners. This is about cloud seeding. Not chemtrails.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you are unwilling to read, you are unwilling to learn. There really is no point to this conversation anymore. </p>

<p>The evidence I provided shows that silver iodide is a chemical, along with aluminum, barium, strontium, etc being spraying under the guise of cloud seeding and geoengineering. Farmers have noticed an uptick in all of these heavy metals in their soils and the logical conclusion is that the chemicals we are being doused with is accumulating in the farmland. </p>

<p>Not sure why I even took the time to paraphrase evidence you won&#39;t bother to read. You have proven this conversation is a waste of time. Take care.</p>
