A paid for fantasy dossier + PaPa are not good enough reasons to spy on a rival campaign and launch an investigation when you loose.</p>

Forming a policy team and hosting media is not illegal. It is commonplace. Can you tell me everyone Clinton met,worked with or was photographed with? Those people should be ripe for FISA warrants.</p>

<p>A completely separate warrant application was filed in 2016. Each successive renewal every 90 days required <em>new</em> probably cause. </p>

<p>To say that this is explained by a 2013 warrant is....naive at best. Especially coupled with the new information that Page was working as an FBI asset. </p>

<p>There&#39;s a reason that any time anything bad happened for Trump during the campaign, another &quot;slow leak for maximum impact&quot; of Clinton&#39;s emails would come out.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a reason Assange refused to release the info he admittedly had on Trump. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s completely absurd. Here&#39;s the timeline of leaks: </p>

<p>July 22, DNC leaks get dropped in one giant batch. Supposedly their intended deadline had been earlier that week but they missed the deadline and had to scramble to get the material out before the convention several days later, probably because they had to rush to get out the AKP emails on the Erdogan government on July 19, after the failed July 15 coup in Turkey made the material particularly relevant.</p>

<p>Oct 7, after days of building hype in the media, the Podesta leaks started. A batch of Podesta emails was published <em>every day</em> from then until the election. </p>

<p>The Access Hollywood tape also came out on October 7, but had been <a href="http://www.tmz.com/2016/10/11/donald-trump-hurricane-matthew-access-hollywood-leak/">scheduled to break on NBC several days later</a> because they didn&#39;t want it to compete with Hurricane Matthew coverage, but then someone leaked it to the Washington Post to break on Oct 7. I know the implication is supposed to be that WikiLeaks timed the initiation of their daily Podesta leaks based on the Access Hollywood tape, but they had been building hype for days, and it was the Access Hollywood tape that was pushed up via leaking to another outlet. </p>

<p>On Nov. 6, there was a second batch of less dramatic DNC leaks was released to little hype. According to <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/08/21/julian-assange-a-man-without-a-country">The New Yorker&#39;s Raffi Khatchadourian</a>, &quot;A WikiLeaks staffer told me that they worked so fast that they lost track of some of the e-mails, which they quietly released later in the year.&quot; It isn&#39;t clear exactly what Trump scandal that was supposed to be distracting from, if any.</p>

<p>I&#39;m just not seeing this alleged [pattern of WikiLeaks dumps &quot;any time anything bad happened during the campaign&quot;. The Oct 7 overlap is the closest it gets, but takes ignoring the fact that WikiLeaks had been steadily building hype for their release and that it was the Access Hollywood tape that was leaked to break sooner. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>There&#39;s a reason Assange refused to release the info he admittedly had on Trump.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, he stated the reason at the same time -- because all they&#39;d managed to get on Trump paled in comparison to everything that was coming out of Trump&#39;s own mouth.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There&#39;s a reason they were in contact with Trump Jr., asking him to push stories that Trump himself then tweeted out 15 minutes later.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You mean the link they suggested Trump use <strong>if</strong> he linked to their stuff, the one they&#39;d set up to try to get around Twitter&#39;s censorship of WikiLeaks-related tweets? Yes, they were trying to fight back against censorship being imposed on their publications by having high-profile people who were likely to link to them use a url that wasn&#39;t yet being targeted for censorship.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There&#39;s a reason they felt they needed to &quot;dramatically improve the perception of our impartiality,&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, they stated that reason in the exact same message: because the Clinton campaign was constantly slandering them as pro-Trump/pro-Russia. I wonder why <em>The Atlantic</em> decided to truncate the message before that part in their reporting.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>while not saying a word about Trump.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s just a lie. They have been consistently critical of Trump as well as Clinton. They&#39;ve also publicly solicited submission of Trump tax returns in addition to trying to convince Trump Jr. to submit them.</p>

<p>What I don&#39;t assume, like so many people, is that it is evidence he had nefarious purposes. </p>
