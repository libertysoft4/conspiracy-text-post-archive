Ex: kill bill crash, comments on Roman Polanski victim, etc. It just seems odd how calculated this stuff seems to roll out suddenly. And is almost always framed in a way to make a potential victim look bad... idk maybe it’s nothing or maybe it really is something.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was legit, so legit that they actually identified the victims and were setting up &quot;payments of restituion&quot; meaning the FBI already knew these photos, knew the &quot;models&quot; or the &quot;kids&quot; or &quot;victims&quot; because ANOTHER celebrity paid for at least SOME of them to be PRODUCDED, some of them could be photos of CELEBRITIES as KIDS.... if I were writing a tom clancy book, and i may be writing a book or not, ahaha i am not... nor will I ever.. but the story would go along the lines that mark &quot;got suicided&quot; miles from his house in a canyon by a friend of a friend in the sharing pictures game... </p>

<p>but the biggest clue to mark salling case, the victims are KNOWN. </p>

I could see QT being semi innocent non with standing his shitty comments and creepy actions and this being a smear campaign to shy away not just Sailings death but what he was into. He had a lot of cp, where did it come from and was he involved in the production?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No Mark Saling was not involved in production, he bought &quot;coveted&quot; sets from another celebrity and was cought with those plus THOUSANDS more... </p>

<p>QT is just a fluffer name a distraction from BS and HW, he won&#39;t fall. He&#39;s probably such a creep he gets contracts signed before having fun... </p>

<p>QT is doing a friend a favor by taking some of the heat.</p>

<p>BS, HW are pulling out every trick in the book to not get suicided. IMO. </p>
