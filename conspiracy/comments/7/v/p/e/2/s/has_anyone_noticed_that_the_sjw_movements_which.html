<p>Like these anti-trump people who claim he is a racist then make fun of his skin color.  Or the people mad about fat shaming who then make fun of Trump&#39;s weight.</p>

<p>Are they on crazy pills here?</p>

<p>They say there is no war on white people then turn around and attack people for being white.  Seems kind of hypocritical to me<a href="https://i.imgur.com/bpqu0rj.png">.</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s the obvious and a fact but I&#39;ve seen people get upset because a person described someone as black. It&#39;s the same concept. It should be okay to call someone their skin color because it&#39;s, like you said, obvious. But it seems sjws only think it&#39;s acceptable to call white people white and not black people black. And it&#39;s only okay to call skinny people skinny and not okay to call a fat person fag. I think OP&#39;s point stands. Some comments from sjws are a hypocritical. They want peace and equality but some of them are violent and outcast anyone with a different opinion than them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>people get mad at being described as black when its completely irrelevant otherwise. ie &quot;my black friend tom&quot;, &quot;tom, who&#39;s black&quot; etc etc. it doesnt help that generally, people are attempting to illicit a the white person&#39;s &quot;image of a black person&quot; which is likely to be &#39;ghetto&#39;, speak in heavy ebonics, and be angry &#39;for no reason&#39;. </p>

<p>I have never once been called racist for saying, &quot;Black women are bar none the most abused, mistreated, and neglected group in the United States.&quot; because the black part was RELEVANT to my statement and not attempting to illicit a stereotype or demean the group. &quot;Those god damn black women!&quot; is different, do you see?</p>

<p>no &quot;sjw&quot; wants violence or to outcast, but we understand there can NOT be a civil society where ideas of ethnic or racial superiority, where some groups want genocide, are allowed to have a platform. Intolerance can not be tolerated.</p>

<p>Finally, Racism, contrary to what you believe, is not about skin color. Racism is about about the power dynamic between majority and marginalized groups. To address the orange, people of color can&#39;t take off the color. Trump&#39;s orange is removable. </p>

You can&#39;t seem to decide whether it&#39;s a &quot;bit creepy&quot; or a &quot;bit silly,&quot; you haven&#39;t explained how &quot;Trump haters&quot; now possess a real daddy fetish for him, and you carefully ignored many posts from the link.</p>

<p>Trying (poorly) to turn the daddy mockery around didn&#39;t work out, it just made you look &quot;triggered&quot; - I am using this ironically. Although your comments are thematic I&#39;ll grant you. If this was T_D and not a T_D post that found its way to r/conspiracy I could see how you would go from &quot;people who mock Trump&#39;s fake tan are racists&quot; to &quot;people who mock Trump&#39;s cult of personality have incest fetishes.&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>He has half the story. By attempting to force labels and groups onto people, most political parties and affiliations have turned into exclusivity and contradictory circlejerks. 
Example: Trump saying he will lower taxes for everyone, ends up doing it for a few including a huge cut for himself. Or The DNC saying that trump rigged the election when their primaries were likely rigged. Or any example of any political party in the last couple years. 
TLDR; we need to cut the bullshit and actually work together. </p>

Those on the right see this natural, while those on the left where historically split into two camps.  The first camp was that this conceptual scheme is itself wrong and we need to fight against it in all forms, and the second camp is that the conceptual scheme might not be rooted in nature, but it tells something about our social world, i.e., it has a social reality.    </p>

<p>The second camp predominates, and as such members of this camp still use a racial conceptual schema, all the while claiming that such schema are somehow wrong.  This leads them to holding that  members of certain races have shared characteristics, but that holding that skin color itself is not it.  What essential characteristics are held, are those of historical hierarchies, which need to be rectified.  How are they rectified?  Why by denigrating one race, and attempting to help another... they reproduce the same racial dynamics nominally they are against. </p>

<p>I think that they simply can&#39;t do away with that racial schema, or at least don&#39;t really know how to actually fight it or dismantle it. </p>

<p>I agree, but my point was somewhat more broad, and aimed at the &#39;left&#39;, or at least the type of &#39;left&#39; politics that dominate the campus and online.  Which is that they don&#39;t know how to escape racialism, and end up reproducing it themselves. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are absolutely right in this analysis, and I share it about it the right.  The stance about free speech is just  a wedge issue where the goal is to privatize all institutions,  that way any restrictions on people&#39;s freedom,  what to teach, how to talk, etc can be justified because &#39;it is a private company so they can do what they want&#39;, or another version of that talking point.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Make fun of his skin color&quot;. It is orange from dying because he is narcissistic. It isn&#39;t a natural color of people. Next we are talking about a war on white people.  I thought we were making fun of his skin color for being ORANGE not white like his is supposed to be? What aren&#39;t you getting? I understand his post is about the hyprocrisy of SJW&#39;s but we are a whole different problem. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is wanting to look “good” necessarily narcissistic?
I don’t think so.
I think there’s a point it becomes narcissistic, like when your skin is permanently orange or looks like leather. When your teeth are so fucking white it looks like chalk. When you obsess about it constantly.</p>

<p>I don’t really thing general cosmetic upkeep is narcissistic. Though I do agree that our society tends to be a little crazy about it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I getcha. There are definitely other reasons from Trump I could&#39;ve focused on but the example in the post was about making fun of his orange skin. </p>

<p>&quot;narcissistic:having an excessive or erotic interest in oneself and one&#39;s physical appearance.&quot;</p>

<p>Based upon definition I guess there is a point but it seems like a fine line. I agree though the compulsive whitening, tanning, straightening, and dyeing definitely are. It just seems like everyone has to be done up to stroke your ego which seems to fit the definition. </p>

<p>You said &quot;orange isn&#39;t a real skin color&quot; - I don&#39;t have to twist this to show just how ridiculous and stupid that sounds. Trump is just tanned like everyone else who looks &quot;orange.&quot; </p>

I&#39;ve got a feeling that people only come to this sub now because it&#39;s one of the few remaining places where whatever &quot;side&quot; you happen to be on isn&#39;t in a total echo chamber. I sound like the old conspiracy guy with the big white beard, but in my day conspiracy subs were full of people who realised that both sides were corrupt and controlled by the same people. It was regularly cited as the Hegelian Dialectic - thesis, antithesis, synthesis. Propose an idea, the other side fight it, an agreement is reached somewhere in the middle that was always the intended outcome. Why is evidence of thing that someone asked for now resulting in being downvoted. No doubt this comment will be downvoted for questioning the downvotes. C&#39;mon old-school conspiracy people take back this sub, these new people are shit and boring, let them go back to <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> where they can be boring and regurgitate whatever side they are on talking points of the day.

<p>He didn&#39;t decide to own it. That implies people called him alt-right so he embraced it, sort of like how the LGBT community embraced &quot;queer.&quot; That&#39;s not the case. At the time, &quot;alt-right&quot; was the preferred term, one <em>created</em> by people in the so-called alt-right movement (apparently coined by Paul Gottfried and made popular by Richard Spencer) and used by them until it became a target for mockery.</p>

<p>The new preferred term seems to be &quot;new right.&quot; We&#39;ll see how long that lasts.</p>

<p>And yes, for those keeping score, there&#39;s a good deal of irony in <em>these people</em> having preferred terms they want to be referred to by and the terms they don&#39;t want people using for them.</p>

<p>So because a handful of people originally self identified as alt-right before the name was tarnished that means it can&#39;t be used as a derogatory label with the same intent of the sjw label?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Uh, the Alt-Right group was created by Richard Spencer, a white supremacist.  Sure, other, non-racist right wingers took up the label for their own reasons -- anti-Government types, MRA tyepes, etc. but the media didn&#39;t slander the name &#39;alt-right&#39;.   People with a certain view of social ideas lumped themselves under that banner.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can pretend Alt-Right isn&#39;t used in the same way SJW is but I have seen it many times. Just because a group with a handful of people used this term before it was derogatory does not mean it isn&#39;t currently used in a derogatory fashion much like SJW is used.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d say that the term &quot;alt-right&quot; became derogatory because the people who made up the alt-right tarnished the name themselves and are now trying to run from it, without changing the ideas that tarnished the word in the first place.</p>

<p>The term &quot;Neoliberal&quot; and &quot;Neoconservative&quot; became somewhat derogatory terms in the same way.  Should we stop calling Hillary Clinton a neoliberal because the word has taken on negative characteristics due to the failure of the philosophy?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The alt-right&#39;s conception was conceived by Richard Spencer.  That&#39;s who coined the term.  He&#39;s the one who promoted it, through his National Policy Institute website.  </p>

<p>Richard Spencer is a white supremacist.  He wanted to create a home for people who didn&#39;t look like rednecks, skinheads, Aryan Brotherhood types (basically people who would look professional in a business setting) to push his white supremacist ideals.</p>

<p>Now when the alt-right was presented to you, it may not have been presented in a way that was race first.  And certainly, non-racist Conservatives glomed onto the label to help push their own beliefs, but it&#39;s conception was absolutely rooted in white supremacism.</p>

Usage of &quot;warriors for social justice first originated in the early 1930&#39;s: &quot;But the actual phrase &quot;warrior for social justice&quot; first appears in library database searches five years earlier—and in the United States. From Fantasy, volumes 1–2 (1931) [combined snippets]:</p>

<p>He [Charles Erskine Scott Wood] is a pioneer and path-finder in fields and wildernesses and deserts of thought, frontiersman on many intellectual horizons. But he also helped push the physical frontier further toward the Northwest. He is a warrior for social justice and in the one war that can never end: the campaign for truth.&quot;</p>

<p><em>Yes there is.</em></p>

<p>The &quot;social justice&quot; in SJW, is a call to action by the scourge of postmodern neo-marxism currently plaguing the west. It&#39;s an unholy, alliance between the technically incompatible philosophy of postmodernism, and ideology of neo-marxism, where instead of the Marxist group conflict between the bourgeois vs. proletariat, it pits the oppressed vs. oppressors, and paradoxically tries to justify it with postmodernism.</p>

<p>It&#39;s being used quite heavy handedly in globalist/lefty/democratic circles as controlled-opposition, to weaponize the west&#39;s liberal values against itself, for the furthering of policy goals that globalist elites desire. </p>

When you find someone not even willing to hear the other side no matter your background, you&#39;ve found someone brainwashed by neo-Marxist ideology that&#39;s taken over your typical college campus. You should take a chance and look deeper into Communism and Marxism and see for yourself the underlying philosophical structures that are similar to today&#39;s cultural climate of SJWs.</p>

<p>I hear your side.  It&#39;s total unproveable bullshit that is a form of ideological censorship.  You can label anyone a SJW without providing any proof.

    <div class="md"><p>Well I see what you&#39;re saying, but culture is and has always been an ideological battle ground. I can agree that there isn&#39;t any 1 person that embodies the philosophies of an SJW, but that&#39;s not how ideologies become action. Ideologies manifest when enough people come together to make a movement possible. It&#39;s not that every person in the movement agrees on every premise of the ideology. It&#39;s that there&#39;s enough philosophical agreement that justifies their movement together as a group. And I&#39;m arguing that the current left has agreed upon philosophical precepts that run counter to western ideology of individuality.</p>

<p>You should look into how Nazism and Communism actually came into being. It&#39;s not that there was an entire nation of evil people, it&#39;s that there was a movement of enough people with enough philosophical similarity that amalgamated into the monster we read about in history books.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In case you forgot the entire idea of America was based on liberal philosophies from the Enlightenment.  The concept of a free society, guaranteeing freedom of religion, speech, press and protest are the foundation of our nation.  This is buttressed by the belief that all humans deserve basic human rights that are unalienable.  Does that mean Thomas Jefferson was a cultural Marxist for believing in equality?  Based on these arbitrary definitions it seems anything remotely liberal is classified as cultural Marxism. </p>

<p>I know how Marxism and Christian Nationalism came into being.  You’re the one defending a right wing ideology that says we can ban groups of people based on their religion or discriminate against citizens based on religious beliefs. The alleged “cultural marxists” think this violates the rights granted under the Constitution and are using their first amendment rights to speak and protest these policies. </p>

<p>Comparing these positions to soviet style communism is an inaccurate an unproveable assertion.   Citing propaganda from the 30s and 50s or talking head videos doesn’t prove anyone is SJW. </p>

<p>Instead of making one line references without context provide specific details and evidence that the people you accuse are indeed SJWs.  The sad thing is this theory only seems to exist in a right wing echo chamber. Clearly the socialists in Norway are nothing like socialists in North Korea or the former USSR.  You’ll make no distinction between them, you’ll lump them all into the same pile despite major fundamental differences.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Woah woah woah... what&#39;s with all the misinformation... You clearly don&#39;t know your history and the meanings of the words you spout... Before going any further, my hope is that you take the ideas I’m suggesting and do further research because it’s pretty clear that you don’t understand this topic or its components too well. 
The belief that all humans deserve basic unalienable human rights is NOT cultural Marxism and is a magnificent ahistorical interpretation... The constitution and the liberal philosophies that emerged from the Enlightenment explain that every person should have certain natural, basic, unalienable human rights. Marxism which wasn&#39;t created until the mid 19th century took a leap and suggested that all people should be equal. These are fundamentally two entirely different premises. The enlightenment was about equal opportunity by supplying the individual unalienable rights while Marxism was about equality of outcome where methods of how equality is achieved are put on the sideline. This is a very important distinction because the world is inherently unequal, ie it’s going to be very hard to argue equality of outcome in basketball when one player is 5’-0” and another is 6’9”, some people are smarter than others, some are physically disabled, some have talent in math, while others having more talent in music, some people are born into richer families while others are born into poorer families. What this means is that outcome will inevitably be varied. What’s worse, Marxist ideology is the philosophical underpinnings, of Communism, with the same supposition of “equality” (more specifically equality of outcome) which has NEVER worked in our history, look into Soviet Russia, Maoist China, Venezuala today…
The current SJW phenomenon happening right now has similar underpinnings of Communism rooted in Marxist ideology.  PC culture, race shaming (ironically today against whites), 3rd and 4th wave feminism (male hate rhetoric), all have similar underpinnings of Marxist ideology where group identities trump individual identity. I’ll give you clear examples of where this ideology has infected college campuses. You don’t have to look any further than UC Berkeley where Ann Coulter speech was cancelled, Milo’s speech was cancelled, and Ben Shapiro’s speech cost him $600,000 for security. I don’t agree with everything they say, but when radical leftists RIOT, damage school property, or makes people pay more than half a million dollars for security, I have to wonder why. When youtube, demonetizes conservative think tanks and even liberal’s like Dave Rubin, I start wondering why the hell they are censoring a gay liberal. The common trend in all of this, is that they all criticize the SJW movement that is rooted in Marxist ideology. It’s not a theory, you only need to do a little research to find out the truth that you’re so unwilling to consider possible.</p>

<p>To add, the reason why socialism works in Norway or other Scandinavian countries is because comparatively to the US they have a very small population and they culturally homogeneous. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Based on your descriptions of cultural marxism, the belief in egalitarianism ideals that espouse equality would be considered cultural marxism despite the fact it predates marxism.  That&#39;s part of the problem.  The descriptions of cultural marxism in all the videos and documentation you guys provide condemns all liberal beliefs.  It applies gross generalizations to anyone with left leaning ideals and makes no effort to prove any kind of association.</p>

<p>I know the meanings of the words.  I&#39;m not the one trying to apply different meaning to entire groups of people.  That would be guys like you who continue to propagate this bullshit claim that protestors are SJW cultural marxists because they disagree with the policies of right wing politicians who are trying to ban groups of people because of religion, or using religion to discriminate against citizens who are supposed to be treated equally under the law.  You cant prove that anyone you decide to call a sjw cultural marxist is indeed a cultural marxist.</p>

<p>Nobody here with left leaning beliefs is advocating for soviet style marxism which is what you keep comparing them to.</p>

<p>The UC Berkeley speeches were cancelled because of the threat to public safety.  Not because people want to turn America into Soviet Russia.  People were killed at prior speeches by right wing extremists like what happened in Portland or Charlottesville.  Public safety and the costs for security paid by the taxpayers was the reason why those speeches were cancelled.  Not every protestor rioted or damaged property and they certainly didnt stab, shoot or drive a car into crowds of right wind protestors like what happened in Charlottesville.</p>

<p>There is no proof the SJW movement even exists.  It&#39;s a theory that bounces around inside of a right wing echo chamber with no way to prove anyone belongs to it.  The only people who take it seriously are those who defend the unconstitutional policies of Donald Trump&#39;s administration.</p>

<p>No, the reason why socialism works in Norway and other Scandianavian countries is they practice market based socialism.  The government provides infrastructure, but their economy participates on a free market.  We use the same kind of socialist policies in America as it relates to providing education, police and fire protection and taxpayer funded military.  The truth is, we, the people, own and fund everything by proxy as taxpayers.  That is a form of socialism.  Those services are funded by taxpayers for the benefit of all citizens.</p>

<p>The truth is Norway and other countries under the Nordic model, or even UK, France and Germany have socialistic policies that underpin their countries, but they are not practicing soviet style socialism or communism.  They have major fundamental differences, like participation in market based economies, that separates them from your idea of Marxist ideology.</p>

<p>The truth is you dont understand the meanings of communism and socialism and are trying to attribute all forms of liberalism to soviet style marxism.  </p>

<p>It is a theory.  You cannot prove that anyone is a sjw cultural marxist.  All you can do is cite talking head videos where people talk about the theory.  Nobody has a cultural marxist membership card.  Nobody talks about these things but right wing extremists.  In fact, these things were spawned from anti-communist propaganda in the 30s and 50s.  They are anachronistic relics of the Cold War.  It&#39;s neo-McCarthyism used to perpetuate an ideological culture war against other Americans that disagree with right wing policies like banning people because of their religion or making corporations people or allowing Christians to discriminate against other Americans based on their Christian beliefs or to deny rights to an American citizen because they happen to be attracted to the same sex.</p>

<p>You cant prove PC culture, race shaming, 3rd and 4th wave feminism have anything to do with Marxism.  These are empty claims you cannot back up.  Believing all people are equal under the law, as stated in our Constitution, including minorities and women is not race shaming or male hating.  That&#39;s a guaranteed right in the Constitution.</p>

<p>&quot;Nobody here with left leaning beliefs is advocating for soviet style marxism which is what you keep comparing them to.&quot;
No one intends to, but when you start spouting equality of outcome for everyone, it&#39;s a marker of the underlying philosophical root of Marxism. </p>

<p>I can list more if you want.</p>

<p>&quot;The truth is, we, the people, own and fund everything by proxy as taxpayers. That is a form of socialism. Those services are funded by taxpayers for the benefit of all citizens.&quot;
I agree that the people hold power over government. I never argued against this. I also never said the US doesn&#39;t have socialist policies in play, to deny this is stupid, and your simply projecting like numerous other times to think I denied this.</p>

<p>&quot;The truth is you dont understand the meanings of communism and socialism and are trying to attribute all forms of liberalism to soviet style marxism.&quot;
No, that&#39;s why I clearly communicated &quot;Neo-Marxism&quot; and rightly said that the underpinnings of communism and socialism have much of its roots in Marxist ideology explaining further that the primary problem with Marxist ideology is that of equality of outcome. You&#39;re still not using terms correctly or you&#39;ve misunderstood my posts...</p>

<p>&quot;It is a theory. You cannot prove that anyone is a sjw cultural marxist. &quot;
Just like gravity is a theory, but when I see it I call it out to question it. When other&#39;s see it, it affirms my beliefs. Hey I&#39;m socially liberal on policies, but when I see SJW&#39;s I&#39;ll call it out and when there are liberal voices in the media that call it out, I&#39;m ready to hold it true.</p>

<p>&quot;You cant prove PC culture, race shaming, 3rd and 4th wave feminism have anything to do with Marxism. These are empty claims you cannot back up.&quot;
I think I just did. To deny this is to deny there&#39;s air in the air.</p>

<p>&quot;Believing all people are equal under the law, as stated in our Constitution, including minorities and women is not race shaming or male hating.&quot;
As I said in my earlier post, the enlightenment was about equal opportunity by supplying the individual unalienable rights, meaning people are equal under the law, while Marxism was about equality of outcome where methods of how equality is achieved are put on the sideline, ie even if I earned my money with my hard work and time, those sitting at home not doing anything deserve the same amount of pay as I do.</p>

<p>Put a little more effort into seeing the other side. If it was Neo-McCarthyism, you wouldn&#39;t find so many liberals jumping ship. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re the one that is brainwashed insisting this group exists despite a complete inability to prove it.  Nobody says they belong to this sjw cultural marxist group, the only people who talk about it are right wing ideologues.</p>

<p>As far as Berkley cancelling, here was their reasoning:  &quot;&quot;It is extremely unfortunate that this announcement was made at the last minute, even as the University was in the process of spending significant sums of money and preparing for substantial disruption of campus life in order to provide the needed security for these events,&quot; Assistant Vice Chancellor Dan Mogulof said in a statement. &quot;</p>

<p>Milos had done a speech in February that ended up in riots.  Saying they cancelled because of security and costs appears to be the exact reason the chancellor decided to cancel it.</p>

<p>I can however show people who willfully identify as neo-nazis and white supremacists.  I don&#39;t call people neo-nazis or white supremacists without proof that they are actually neo-nazis and white supremacists.  To apply that SJW label to anyone without evidence is a gross generalization that cant be proven.</p>

<p>You did not prove PC culture, race shaming and 3rd and 4th wave feminism have anything to do with marxism.  You cited videos with talking heads giving their opinions on the topic.  That&#39;s not actually proof.  Thats the opinions of talking heads.</p>

<p>Nobody here is arguing for &quot;equality of outcome&quot; or for flat wages like in soviet style Marxism.  Why do you keep making these comparisons?  To demonize people with left leaning ideas by calling them communists or marxists maybe?</p>

<p>I&#39;m not going to put any effort into seeing the other side.  It&#39;s simply a way the right wing has come up with invalidating anyone that disagrees with their policies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I guess we just have a misunderstanding on our hands. I don&#39;t think everyone with left leaning ideals is an SJW cultural Marxist. I never said that and I&#39;d agree it&#39;s definitely a gross generalization. </p>

<p>That&#39;s why I&#39;ve always said &quot;radical leftist&quot;. This doesn&#39;t mean liberal or even left for me. I think a lot of our miscommunication is coming from not defining the words we&#39;re using.</p>

<p>I&#39;d categorize SJW&#39;s with radical leftists, but I think are part of the fringe. Dangerous, but still fringe. I think radical leftists have a dangerous ideology possibly more dangerous than KKK or fringe right simply because SJW&#39;s and radical leftists work in the name of the disenfranchised (there&#39;s a moral component). Personally I think it&#39;s easier to get this kind of danger mixed up from friend or foe, it&#39;s easier to spot the radical right. I think most lefties are just plain liberals with a more recent trend towards socialist ideology, but that&#39;s not the same as radical leftist. </p>

<p>Liberal ideals are definitely not the same as Marxism and have no root in Marxism and to clarify I think it&#39;s just the current radical left/SJW that fit the description. </p>

<p>Anytime I see this SJW argument its typically being used to generalize all liberals without distinction.  That if you disagree, you must be a SJW cultural marxist.  Watch these 10 videos and read this anti-communist propaganda from the 1930s and 1950s because its totally true.  It feels like another way to divide us and distract from what&#39;s actually happening by tossing labels at people.</p>

<p>It feels like there&#39;s a lot of generalizing going on from the right.  That all Muslims must be terrorists.  That all Mexicans are rapists murderers and that all Liberals must be cultural marxists.  That is what infuriates me.</p>

<p>I apologize for that.  I&#39;m just as guilty of generalizing you as one of the other idiots claiming every left leaning person is an SJW cultural marxist that believes in soviet style marxism and hates America.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I definitely don&#39;t agree with the notion that all liberals are SJW cultural Marxis and I can agree that it does sound like neo-McCarthyism. The problem is there is a powerful movement by a vocal minority that seriously affect social, cultural, political atmosphere that uses the guise of liberal/progressive ideals of the 60&#39;s, but is an absolute antithesis to those very ideals. It&#39;s something that the right and left could actually agree with and I think more liberals are catching on to it. Because of this guise, I think it&#39;s actually far more dangerous than the radical right. A majority of Americans know that there are grave repercussions for being racist, homophobic, bigoted, sexist, etc, but when the SJW radical left starts to call anyone who wrongthinks with these kinds of accusations, individuals have the problem of being potentially shut down simply because someone doesn&#39;t like what they are saying even if it might not be racist, homophobic, bigoted, sexist, etc.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a lot of generalizing on both sides. I don&#39;t think anyone but the fringe ever said all Muslims are terrorist or that all Mexicans are rapists, but I do see people on both the left and right presenting statistics that most Muslims believe in Sharia Law or that there&#39;s a high percentage of undocumented immigrants that disproportionately commit crime. Multiculturalism is great only to the extent that people are willing to abide/live by by the fundamental American ideals/laws of freedoms stated in our constitution.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t vote for Trump (the fact that anyone has to preface with this statement shows the momentum of SJW radical left) but the ban on the 7 or 8 Muslim countries were countries that were noted by the Obama Admin as having highest probability of terrorists. Also, protecting our borders should be a bipartisan issue, it takes a lot more to become a citizen in Scandinavian countries than it is to become a citizen in America. Do I agree with his decision on the ban or the wall? Not entirely. But are they completely unjustified? No. </p>

<p>I wanted to make sure we came to some understanding because it&#39;s easy to fall into &quot;sides.&quot; It&#39;s important that we don&#39;t, there&#39;re too many people that do. It&#39;s hard to do on the internet, especially Reddit because it takes time to respond, it&#39;s hard to read emotion, it&#39;s just not the same as a face to face conversation. You&#39;ll find that you can agree with more people than not or at least come to agree to disagree. Anyway, good luck. </p>

Conservatives like him because he has hit on some interesting ways of looking at some topics (like life in modern US) that they enjoy. But if you watch videos of him teaching courses, it&#39;s clear that he&#39;s of the liberal philosophical slant. What sets him apart is that he prefers to make sense rather than go off the deep end like so many liberals tend to do.</p>

<p>lol. I love this, but I want to say I don&#39;t think all liberals are like this and I doubt anyone who can distinguish themselves as a classical liberal from today&#39;s radical leftists aren&#39;t like this either.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve probably said this a bunch of times, but I think Jordan Peterson is an intellectual powerhouse. His brain works on so many levels so quickly, it&#39;s inspiring. His ability to truly listen or try to understand multiple points of views at once is crazy . </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I get the impression you actually, physically jab yourself with your finger when you say &quot;nobody here is arguing for Marxist communism&quot;. SJWs mainly argue within one of two modes: a chaotic, riotous gang-up (&quot;brigade&quot;); or a complete and utter isolation chamber with a total vacuum of fact, of history, of present conditions and events, and of guilt by association.</p>

<p>So far in your argument with this other redditor, you have managed to eek out one single word in retaliation to the facts, and that word is &quot;egalitarianism&quot;.</p>

<p>A simpleton browsing wikipedia will find, I was upset to discover, a hyperrealized term that broadly umbrellas a very wide range of documents and philosophies but with one transparently obvious and onerous thread joining them all. That thread being the preferred historical dressing up that cultural Marxists prefer to parade around in.</p>

<p>A quick glance at the etymology of &quot;egalitarianism&quot; reveals that its first use is somewhere between 1874, well after the establishment of the most prominent documents espoused to carry its tone. Nearly all academic sources on so-called &quot;egalitarianism&quot; are written more as an up-to-speed &quot;how to guide&quot; than an actual academic article, with three sources claiming three first use dates and one of them claiming two differing ones.</p>

<p>This is indicative of the problems with allowing cultural marxism to take hold in the academic establishments. Revisionism and inaccuracy in worship of idealised fantasy worlds set as unmoving political objectives. I personally put it all down to poor potty training, oedipal complexes, etc.</p>

<p>You&#39;re part of the problem here.  You&#39;re using cultural marxism as a label to attack anyone with left leaning ideals despite the fact you cant prove they are cultural marxists.  You are proving its being used as a form of neo-McCarthyism to demonize people who have different opinions than you, and the irony is you say I live in a fantasy world but youre the one making allegations and cant back up your claims.  </p>

<p>Being an SJW is taking in facts like these and still blaming some mythical &quot;system&quot; on the circumstances of their perceived injustice. It&#39;s pure misinformation and is the biggest danger to our society today.

<p>I think I can now agree with you that you can&#39;t call someone an SJW with absolute certainty as you would an skin head who waves his banner up high. But I can with absolute certainty tell you when SJW type or radical leftist thinking is at play because they&#39;ll always double down on their mistake just like true white supremacists and skinsheads would on their insane ideology of race supremacy. </p>

<p>Maybe its a protest against the militarization of the police and the fact more civilians have died at the hands of police that any point in American history.  BLM didnt just spring up out of nowhere, it took unnarmed civilians being killed by police, mainly minorities, to get people angry enough to take to the streets.  Nobody is justifying violence, but when people are angry, they can get violent.  More than 1,000 people died at the hands of police last year.  Police brutality is a real thing in America.  Don&#39;t believe me?  Ask the nurse in Utah who got slammed to the wall and arrested for refusing to violate the Constitutional rights of one of her patients.</p>

It&#39;s too bad it wasn&#39;t. I&#39;m also against the militarization of the police and very against police brutality. However, the riots occurred because of the fair ruling of finding innocent the cop that shot Michael Brown. I&#39;m not saying there isn&#39;t racial injustice or police brutality in America, there&#39;s a lot of work to be done. But when you base your movement on a false narrative, it smells of victim mentality, oppressor vs oppressed, nao-Marxist ideology.</p>

<p>&quot;The data shows women dont receive equal pay for equal work. When you isolate parts of that data and take it out of context, you can spin a narrative like &quot;in the top 150 cities women get paid more&quot; but you&#39;re taking the data out of context.&quot;</p>

<p>You&#39;re right, when you take a multivariable analysis to account women who don&#39;t have children, who don&#39;t leave their profession, who negotiate aggressively, and who work in the same work with the same amount of hours of work, the average pay of women and men converge. </p>

<p>&quot;No, it doesnt mean its coming from a radical leftist or SJW. It was a protest gone wrong. He resigned as a result. That doesnt actually prove your claims.&quot;</p>

<p>He was wrongfully terminated and the school paid him $500,000 in damages. Student&#39;s called him racist even though he has a history of fighting racism. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/jul/25/bret-weinstein-files-38m-tort-claim-against-evergr/">https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/jul/25/bret-weinstein-files-38m-tort-claim-against-evergr/</a></p>

<p>“[Evergreen] failed to set and enforce necessary boundaries in the workplace on campus, selectively has chosen not to enforce its student Code of Conduct, and sent the unmistakable message that the school will tolerate (and even endorse) egregious violations (and even crimes) purportedly to advance racial social goals, diminishing the collegiate experience for all, and fostering a racially hostile work and retaliatory environment for faculty and staff,”</p>

<p>This is what SJW ideology looks like in practice. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Ferguson riots started the day after he was shot.  It was the response to excessive force that resulted in the killing of an unnarmed man.  A black man.  Dylan Root could kill 9 people in a church and be taken into custody without a scratch.</p>

<p>Even when citizens follow the rules, like Philando Castile did when he got pulled over, they get shot and killed.  It wasn&#39;t just Michael Brown, it was Philando Castile, Trayvon Martin and every other black man that got killed by an overzealous, and predominantly white, police force.  I don&#39;t blame black americans for feeling like they are oppressed when these things happen and people get off scott free.  They were slaves for over 200 years and only got the right to vote 40 years ago.  We might have legalized civil rights, but that doesnt mean racism disappeared from people or institutions.</p>

<p>The data also shows that men who do have children and build families are paid more than women who do have children and build families.  We can isolate parts of that data set all day long, but on average across all that data, women get paid less than men for the same jobs.</p>

<p>The protest went wrong at Evergreen, that doesnt mean its evidence of some massive SJW conspiracy.  Taking language from a tort lawsuit filed against the school doesnt mean those claims are true.  Did they fail to set and enforce necessary boundaries?  Sure, that&#39;s a fair assessment.  Claiming its proof of SJW ideology is a stretch.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not saying there are injustices, prejudicial injustices, or that there isn&#39;t racism, etc. But to justify rioting and molotov cocktails is kind of crazy especially in the situation where Brown went for the officer&#39;s gun after he store from a convenient store...
<a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/11242108/Ferguson-timeline-of-events-since-Michael-Browns-death.html">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/11242108/Ferguson-timeline-of-events-since-Michael-Browns-death.html</a></p>

<p>But I guess I can give you a little leeway on that issue. I just don&#39;t think violence is in anyone&#39;s interest.</p>

<p>&quot;The data also shows that men who do have children and build families are paid more than women who do have children and build families. We can isolate parts of that data set all day long, but on average across all that data, women get paid less than men for the same jobs.&quot;</p>

<p>This is most likely because in a typical household, women will HAVE to take time off work from a job to have the baby. This isn&#39;t fair by any measure, but it&#39;s a huge factor. If you look at data tat shows men who have children get paid more than women who have children, I think it&#39;s pretty obvious why that&#39;s the case. Women have to take off work. I think there should definitely be some solution to this, but to say there&#39;s no pay equity because of sexism and patriarchy is plain false.</p>

<p>I&#39;m saying SJW ideology is rooted in Marixist ideology of oppressor vs oppressed. In this situation the white professor was automatically group identified as &quot;white oppressor.&quot; His refusal to participate in the Day of Absence got him fired even though it should be his unalienable right to protest the event. See how in this case an individual&#39;s unalienable right to free speech/protest was violated? </p>

<p>Below is a good example of SJWs at work.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1P_1mLlJik">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1P_1mLlJik</a></p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying any one of the individuals embody the true all encompassing essence of an SJW, but the ideology driving the mob is that of SJWism rooted in neo-Marxist ideology. </p>

<p>No the SJW idea is based on &quot;collective rights&quot;. Your social group is either oppressor or oppressed. It ignores the individual in favour of the group. Do you think that people who oppose the SJW mentality genuinely don&#39;t want people to have equal opportunities or they don&#39;t want a more meritocratic society? That&#39;s not true and nobody equates people who want fairness and egalitarianism as being SJW cultural Marxists. Most people want fairness and people to have a equal opportunity. What people oppose is the notion that you are either inherently good or bad, oppressed or oppressor based on your social group</p>

<p>Well, if they do they are wrong. Honestly, the anti-SJW people I&#39;ve seen online are totally for meritocratic societies that don&#39;t discriminate based on race, sexuality, gender etc. The SJW types are disliked because they use bullying tactics and are authoritarians using &quot;compassion&quot; as a guise to silence people with opposing opinions. They generally refuse to debate or discuss and seem to view opposing viewpoints as &quot;the enemy&quot;. They actually harm the overall move towards greater fairness as moderates see their tactics as something that is unreasonable so they end up thinking that because the people pushing the ideas are unreasonable, the overall aims might be as well. The &quot;no platforming&quot; and &quot;punch a nazi&quot; tactics are totally opposite to everything for which liberals stood. I&#39;ve seen people on videos get punched despite specifically saying they were not Nazis or racist, so clearly it&#39;s an excuse to legitimise violence against people they view as opponents</p>

<p>Because it&#39;s founded on collectivism rather than empowering the individual it&#39;s led to the situation where if an individual from a social group has a different opinion to the majority of that group then, if they are black for example, then they are called &quot;sell-outs&quot;, &quot;Uncle Tom&quot; or told they are suffering from &quot;internalised racism&quot; etc. People are individuals first so thinking that someone from a group should have the same opinion just because they are from the group is stupid. </p>

<p>Many of the SJW types treat minorities as fragile incompetent idiots who white people have to use their &quot;privilege&quot; to protect and don&#39;t see them as anything other than victims. To me, this is  racist as it&#39;s based on the idea that white people need to help people of colour as they&#39;re too stupid to do it themselves. The old racists at least thought they were a threat and could achieve things, the new left doesn&#39;t think they can do anything at all without their help.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure some who subscribe to the idea do so because their heart is in the right place, but lots of the more vocal elements of the &quot;new left&quot; are hypocritical and are pro censorship, pro violence and anti-discussion. I hope people don&#39;t think because people are opposed to SJW types that means they are opposed to wanting a fair and equal society too.</p>

<p>I sometimes think that the old-school racists are actually less racist than the SJW types. At least they thought &quot;the other&quot; was a credible threat who could actually do things. The white SJWs see other races as being these ineffectual scared creatures who can&#39;t make anything of their lives unless the white SJW helps them navigate society with their &quot;privilege&quot;. Fortunately, most black people I know don&#39;t have the same victim mentality that the SJWs wished they had. It&#39;s funny that the &quot;white man&#39;s burden&quot; has come back, but is now supposedly &quot;compassionate&quot;. People are people whatever their race, sexuality etc. Some people are dicks, some people are cool. Some white people get dealt more of a shitty hand than some black people. Don&#39;t be a victim, not everybody is out to get you. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>These ideas for the left are generally around the concept of &quot;punching up&quot; vs &quot;punching down&quot; where more things are acceptable to do to criticize those in authority. But the SJWs are generally against fat shaming (and calling him orange is not comparative to racism, but you know that already) and i&#39;ve seen them criticizing the mainstream dems for doing it frequently.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s because the SJW mindset is to simplify the terms of engagement based on &quot;oppressors&quot; and &quot;victim.&quot; Those who are part of the &quot;oppressive&quot; group identity are shamed while those who are part of the &quot;victim&quot; group identity are protected. It&#39;s no longer about individuals, it&#39;s about what group a person can be identified as and are judged based on that group identity. There are 2 caveats to this formula. 1) A person part of the &quot;oppressive&quot; group identity can ask for forgiveness and join the movement for crimes they did not commit, but are nevertheless responsible for those crimes because they can be seen as part of the &quot;oppressive&quot; group identity. 2) If someone who can be identified as part of the &quot;victim&quot; group identity, but speaks out against the methodology or against the ingroupthink, that person will no longer be part of the &quot;victim&quot; group identity and can be subject to shaming. </p>

<p>ie White liberal apologizes and says he can&#39;t understand racism because he is white, joins movement.
ie Black speaks out against NeoMarxist ideology can be considered a coon, uncle tom, etc.
ie Black who comes out as conservative can be considered a coon, uncle tom, etc.
ie Woman who know pay gap is a myth is a fat slut, etc.
ie Conservatives (without defining what conservative even means) are all Nazi&#39;s.
ie Person doesn&#39;t agree with SJW, the person is a Nazi.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don’t worry about other groups of people.  It’s always the loudest, craziest people that cut through the background noise and get our attention.  They are probably not representative of the group of people you are trying to lump them in with.</p>

<p>If you accept the premise of the saying &#39;The more I learn, the more I realize how much I don&#39;t know.&#39;, you can flip it around to mean ‘Anyone who isn’t talking to you as if what they’re saying could be wrong is probably too stupid or ignorant to really want to listen to’.</p>

<p>One of the key takeaways of this point in our history is the breakdown of hatred of other groups of people.  Everything, that you dislike about a group of people will be done by someone of “your” group as well, maybe with a slight shift.  Just ignore the labels people try to sterotype each other with and take things on a case by case basis.</p>

For example there was a guy on the side of the road with a flat bike tire so I helped him fix it. Also I donate to Feeding America which operates food banks for people who are poorer than myself. Also in my elementary school classroom I show my students videos of musicians from all over the world to give them a sense that they share a common humanity with people who look all kinds of different ways.  I dunno. “Social justice” is a great phrase and I would rather rehabilitate it than surrender it to the Tumblrati.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look yall, I don&#39;t hate the guy (Trump), but at the same time I don&#39;t like him. Reality is I just dont care(enough). There are some things he has said that I agree with, and some where im just like, &#39;the fuck?&#39;. But if I can state my opinion without bringing on the crusade, is that the people who support trump are usually confined to certain places. Certain subs, groups whatever..they usually stick close, they dont tend to wander far. But all the Trump protesting is everywhere. Now if it were all civilized it wouldn&#39;t be a problem..but instead we have all this name calling and making fun of each other. </p>

<p>I agree that both sides of the spectrum can be equally as juvenile, but the trump protesting side outnumbers the other. Now that may mean alot, if so many people are against one person. But in the way the message is being put out, it&#39;s not really that appealing. </p>

<p>I respect people not for their beliefs..but for who they are and what they do. Whenever I see a group or individual just constantly attacking  and verbally abusing others...it really makes me not want to associate myself with them. </p>

<p>Im sure there are many others who can relate..You can get along with anyone regardless of their beliefs, but there are certain people who you don&#39;t want anything to do with because of their actions.</p>

<p>Every single time I get online or watch TV, its always trump this, trump that..his wife, sons, daughters, nazis.. its pretty tiring. You&#39;ll see the occasional trump supporting, but it gets quickly drowned out by the protesting negativity.</p>

<p>The way some of yall are presenting yourselves to the world is really...&#39;ugh&#39;. I dont care enough for politics to choose a side. What for? Do you think they&#39;re really in control? That one person or group can change in 4 years what has been established and set in stone for so long? </p>

<p>And for fat shaming, at least in the most recent case of the medical, everyone&#39;s making fun of the fact that the results are almost certainly lies. I hate the man but I don&#39;t give a shit that he&#39;s fat. What I give a shit about is that he feels the need to lie about everything.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There actually is in &quot;group&quot; we&#39;re talking about here, that whether consciously or unconsciously, is possessed in some form or another by ideology.

<p>Most often, what motivates people to carry out the the &quot;Social Justice&quot; in &quot;SJW&quot;,  is an unholy alliance between postmodernism, and neomarxism, so a more accurate term that fits the bill is Postmodern-NeoMarxists.

    <div class="md"><p>It has utility as an abstraction that can allow a person to make statements about that abstraction. Are you in favor of social injustice?<br/>
This Postmodern Neo-Marxist thing sounds a lot more descriptive and interesting. But the point here is that members of a group are individuals. They are all different. Are the police a group? Can we speak accurately of &quot;the police&quot; and make statements about what the police want? Not really. But at least they are defined as people who are employed as police officers, so there is some basis. No one signs a contract to be an SJW, and your definition of what an SJW is will differ from others.<br/>
The title says it all. Apparently SJW&#39;s are against fat shaming but will use weight as a way to insult people. Really? If every single &quot;SJW&quot; doesn&#39;t do this then the statement is false. And if every single SJW doesn&#39;t have the same beliefs on race then the statement is false.<br/>
I am talking about semantics, but semantics are important when people start getting stirred up and believing that an abstraction is a dangerous enemy. I mean we&#39;re in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> here so the idea of being fooled by language is worth thinking about. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>Most people favor justice, but the devil here&#39;s in the details. What&#39;s meant by the term potentially can cast it in doubt. &quot;Justice&quot; can and has meant terrible things to people. Proponents of the the term &quot;social justice&quot; tend to use the term, through a certain ideological filter. The “justice” that those looking through the ideological filter speak of, might as well be &quot;Postmodern-NeoMarxist Justice&quot;, hence &quot;social justice warriors&quot; getting a bad rap... </p>

<p>While it&#39;s technically  possible for the term &quot;SJW&quot; to mean something benign, realistically, the &quot;oppressed&quot; vs. &quot;oppressor&quot; agitators calling themselves &quot;SJWs&quot;  get all the attention, and prevent that from happening. As far as many people are concerned, It just means something different.</p>

<p>&#39;&#39;Progressive&#39;&#39; stack SJW behaviour ruined Occupy Wall Street : <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W81A1kTXPa4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W81A1kTXPa4</a></p>

<p>Inhttps://img.4plebs.org/boards/pol/image/1463/69/1463693047150.jpg</p>

<p>For example, does your &quot;social justice&quot; entail &quot;equity of outcome&quot;? That&#39;s a policy that&#39;ll fail to help others you&#39;re looking to help, and in fact worsens things for them. Reality is unjust. Injustice just is. Their are natural laws, making this an inescapable fact of existence. We&#39;re born different, have different strengths, weaknesses, abilities, etc. And these people incorrectly assume that the concept of the hierarchy comes from some fundamentally corrupt one only found in  humans: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvCsZ_6qRAs">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvCsZ_6qRAs</a></p>

<p>That also doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t, or shouldn&#39;t do anything about it. I actually believe things can and should be done. Not everything can and should be done however.</p>

<p>It&#39;s worth reading the short story <a href="https://img.4plebs.org/boards/pol/image/1507/24/1507244953749.png">Harrison Bergeron</a> on this, or watching one of it&#39;s adaptations.Those legitimately compassionate, and really looking to best address &quot;injustices&quot;, must start by learning to recognize and drop the ideological possession, before they consider going forward. </p>

<p>I&#39;m a good lawyer just trying to serve legal justice, I dislike how layers get a bad rap. Some think we&#39;re protectors, and other think we&#39;re corrupt and litigious. Some layers think/behave differently,  and what the perception of what a lawyer is will differ between people. You&#39;re observing a tilt in the public perception of the word &quot;SJW&quot;. Why that is should be obvious. If we want it to change, we should treat the <em>cause</em>, not effect in the change of perception.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a good definition of just the postmodernism bit:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Postmodernism: an attitude of skepticism: irony towards/rejection of grand narratives, ideologies and universalism, including objective notions of reason, human nature, social progress, absolute truth, and objective reality.</p>

<p>That&#39;s sort of what I&#39;m talking about. A term with no real fixed meaning that seems to be, in my opinion, a sort of preemptory attack on the messenger in order to discredit the message. I don&#39;t think it aids in society moving forward.<br/>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you&#39;re partially right in that it&#39;s an artificial label applied by people who don&#39;t belong to the proposed grouping to define another group of people.</p>

<p>That being said, I think the grouping of people is more or less real -- people with a loyalty to mostly left-wing political causes with an emphasis on sympathetic treatment of racial minorities and population groups thought of as historically discriminated against, principally blacks, women, hispanics, natives, GLBT and so on.</p>

<p>It&#39;s really no different than older categories like &quot;WASP&quot;.  There were no people who ran around calling themselves WASPs, but pretty much everyone knew the general type associated with the label.</p>

<p>I find the fact that &quot;GLBT&quot; exists as a self-imposed grouping to be even more ambiguous than SJW.  There is no one person who is GLBT -- presumably you can&#39;t be a gay male and a lesbian at the same time.  However, given the willingness of transgender activists to accept pretty much any self-selected gender identity, perhaps there are people who claim to be both gay and lesbian at the same time.  </p>

<p>That being said, I&#39;m mostly willing to accept the GLBT label as more or less defining a coherent, activism-oriented grouping of gays, lesbians, bisexuals and transgender people.  I&#39;m not entirely sure how the married gay corporate lawyer sees themselves as aligned with a transgender activist other than maybe some vague cultural affinities, but the same is true for people under the SJW banner -- a woman&#39;s rights activist and an Islamic rights activist might actually be more opposed than unified, but somehow they seem to find common cause.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You make some good points. You&#39;re entirely correct that the term SJW will include people who actually have very different goals. I don&#39;t agree with everything you said, such as I don&#39;t really think that LGBT is really activism oriented. To me it just means anyone who identifies with any of those terms, but yes when you talk about the &quot;LGBT community&quot; that does tend to have some political connotations. The thing is that community doesn&#39;t all agree on everything either.<br/>
Anyway, the whole idea was to put the ideas out there for thought and discussion and I appreciate your thoughts on it. You are correct that these terms and other terms that generalize have always been used and have never been entirely accurate. They do have some use. Language is always a sort of approximation.   </p>

<p>Shit, conservatives work very hard to keep up the racial, cultural and religious wars active, it helps them stay in control.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I agree, but my point was somewhat more broad, and aimed at the &#39;left&#39;, or at least the type of &#39;left&#39; politics that dominate the campus and online.  Which is that they don&#39;t know how to escape racialism, and end up reproducing it themselves. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Liberals do as much of this by claiming that immigrants and blacks can&#39;t care for themselves, so they throw money at them to &quot;save&quot; them. They create income ceilings on welfare that keep the &quot;disadvantaged&quot; from moving up the sociopolitical ladder. As soon as they get a raise, or too many hours, or a bonus, they make too much money to benefit from the state. So they&#39;re forced to either stay out of work, or they move above the threshold and make less money for more work.</p>

<p>Liberals are <em>totally</em> fair.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s the obvious and a fact but I&#39;ve seen people get upset because a person described someone as black. It&#39;s the same concept. It should be okay to call someone their skin color because it&#39;s, like you said, obvious. But it seems sjws only think it&#39;s acceptable to call white people white and not black people black. And it&#39;s only okay to call skinny people skinny and not okay to call a fat person fag. I think OP&#39;s point stands. Some comments from sjws are a hypocritical. They want peace and equality but some of them are violent and outcast anyone with a different opinion than them. </p>
