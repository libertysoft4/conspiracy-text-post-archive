<p>Is this the Smoking gun that FBI sent a mole to infiltrate Trump&#39;s Campaign? This would allow FBI to get whatever FISA warrants they needed to blanket spy.</p>

<p>This is looking like a setup by the FBI now</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In a JPR series beginning last May, readers first learned that Carter Page -- now a key figure in the Nunes Memo — before joining the Trump campaign, was a key informant for the FBI in an investigation and prosecution of Russian intelligence operations in NY.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In Page&#39;s interview with Ingrahm tonight he said that he&#39;d been in contact with members of the intelligence communities for many, many years and that he was a witness in that case. Here&#39;s a link to Page&#39;s interview with Lara Ingraham, start around 21:40 for the noted comments.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve read the transcripts and the entire case, there is literally nothing in that case that supports the notion that Carter Page was working for the FBI. Unless you can quote something from the actual case that proves me wrong.</p>

<p>If you actually read the case, you can clearly see that Carter Page was eager to give energy documents to the Russian spies and was extremely excited to use the spies contacts in Gazprom to make himself rich.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Carter Page was on the Laura Ingrahm show last night. He said he was a witness in that case. If he&#39;s a witness, then it&#39;s not out of the realm of possibilities that he was also an asset. According to the man himself he said that he has worked with the FBI/CIA for many, many years. True its speculative. But no more speculative that Trump colluded with Russia to win the election.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think there&#39;s something to this. Another poster made the comment that this might explain the unfounded claims that the DNC and FBI/DOJ made regarding Nunes memo revealing sources and methods. Its all circumstantial, but sure looks like this may be the case and if true would throw a bit of a wrench into the Carter Page was a Russian spy narrative being pushed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In other words, the investigation is a total sham. The FBI investigated one of their own agents for doing their job so that they could get to the Trump administration.</p>

<p>LOL</p>

<p>It&#39;s crumbled to dust now - completely....</p>

<p>The FBI was working with Carter Page since 2013, sending him into Russia to do secret sting operations and entrap Russian suspected UN operatives - had Carter Page wired up for YEARS...... using him...</p>

<p>Along comes the Trump campaign and the corrupt FBI DOJ dems send Carter Page over to Trumps campaign - luckily for the corrupt Dems he secures a lame low end position, then goes on the FBI missions... and returns, for the FBI... at which point the FBI and DOJ write up their &quot;get dirty Don&quot; plan using Carter Page, their own operative, as the &quot;lynchpin&quot; ...</p>

<p>Carter Page REMAINS UNCHARGED TO THIS DAY BECAUSE HE IS AN FBI DOJ INTEL AGENT....</p>

<p>LMAO</p>

<p>The damned democrappers are now crapping their pants.</p>

<p>Read through the sources. From Justice.gov:</p>

<p>The FBI obtained the recordings after Sporyshev attempted to recruit an FBI undercover employee (“UCE-1”), who was posing as an analyst from a New York-based energy company. </p>

<p>UCE-1 might be Carter Page. From NYTimes</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/04/us/politics/carter-page-trump-russia.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/04/us/politics/carter-page-trump-russia.html</a></p>

<p>The court documents say that Mr. Page, who founded an investment company in New York called Global Energy Capital</p>

<p>I speculate that they didn&#39;t plan for everything to go this far. Their hubris kept them focused on only Hillary winning and still believe she did...</p>

<p>Now, let&#39;s ditch this idea that Page was a controlled FBI informant/asset. That can&#39;t work because the TARGET of the FISA warrant was Carter Page. That is, the DOJ/FBI went before a FISA judge and swore under oath that they had credible verified evidence that Carter Page was working FOR a foreign intelligence service -- they alleged that he was a spy for the Russians, with the implication that Trump hired him because of this and Trump, through Carter Page, was colluding with the Russians to defeat Hillary. That&#39;s the Government&#39;s case.</p>

<p>Why did they think this? Well, according to Nunes&#39; memo, BUT FOR the Steele Dossier, the FISA court would NOT have granted the Carter Page FISA warrant.</p>

<p>So, the FBI was relying on the Steele Dossier for the key predicate fact that Page was a Russian Agent in the employ of Trump. Nunes&#39; memo, backed up by the sworn testimony of Comey, states that the FBI thought the Dossier was &quot;salacious and unverified.&quot; </p>

<p>ShareBlue responds, BUT FISA WARRANT WAS ONLY ISSUED ON DOSSIER! </p>

<p>Response: True, everyone admits that the FBI presented additional information to the FISA Judge, but ROSENSTEIN testified under oath that the FISA warrant would not have issue BUT FOR the inclusion of the Steele Dossier.</p>

<p>So whatever else the FBI presented to the FISA judge, it wasn&#39;t enough on its own to justify the FISA warrant. CASE FUCKING CLOSED. FBI rushed to get FISA warrant because they needed it RIGHT NOW to help Hillary Clinton win the election.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Use American Citizen as an informant to bait foreign intelligence agents. </p></li>
<li><p>Use FISA to surveil this citizen and use their connections to foreign intelligence agents as the probable cause for them being a spy. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>That is, the DOJ/FBI went before a FISA judge and swore under oath that they had credible verified evidence that Carter Page was working FOR a foreign intelligence service -- they alleged that he was a spy for the Russians </p>

<p>They alleged he was a spy, when he was actually a controlled asset.</p>

<p>They perpetrated a fraud upon the court.</p>

<p>They perpetrated a fraud because the Title I warrant they sought and obtained is the broadest warrant available -- it allows you to look in depth into EVERY person Page had contact with.</p>

<p>This, I suspect is what Trump is bragging about here: </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMiIgSpV5dY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMiIgSpV5dY</a></p>

<p>He and his team are &quot;the great sleuth&quot; because they managed to unravel this exceedingly devious FBI/DOJ strategy to surveil and take down Trump.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He also volunteered to go to Russia.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Former Trump campaign volunteer Carter Page, who has come under scrutiny in the investigation of Russian election interference, told a House committee that he sought permission for a July 2016 trip to Moscow from senior Trump campaign officials, and reported to other Trump officials about the trip when he returned. It’s long been known that Page traveled to Moscow in July 2016, but he has said it was in his private capacity, unrelated to his role with the Trump campaign. </p>

<p>Page, whose sworn testimony was released Monday night, told the House Intelligence Committee last week that he sought permission to make the trip from campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, and also notified Hope Hicks, who is now the White House communications director. [New Details Learned From House Intel&#39;s Carter Page Interview] Video Will Begin In... 3 New Details Learned From House Intel&#39;s Carter Page Interview 3:28 Lewandowski told Page he was clear to go on the trip as long as the travel was not associated with his work on the campaign, Page told the committee.</p>

<p>Page also acknowledged that he had been aware that another volunteer campaign adviser, George Papadopoulos, had been meeting with a professor with links to the Kremlin, according to the committee&#39;s ranking Democrat, Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif. Papadopoulos has pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI and is cooperating with special counsel Robert Mueller. Both men served on a campaign foreign policy advisory committee under the supervision of Jeff Sessions, who was then a senator and is now the attorney general. </p>

<p>Page testified he told Sessions about the July 2016 Moscow trip, it has been previously reported. Sessions &quot;advised nothing&quot; when Page told him about his plans to travel to Russia, Page said in the transcript. &quot;Page — after being presented with an email he sent to his campaign supervisors, and which he did not disclose to the committee prior to the interview and despite a subpoena from the Committee — detailed his meetings with Russian government officials and others, and said that they provided him with insights and outreach that he was interested in sharing with the campaign,” Schiff said in a statement. In terse and sometimes heated exchanges with members of the committee, Page admitted that he had met with Russian officials and discussed the U.S. presidential election “in general terms.” He also met with the head of investor relations at Rosneft, a top Russian oil company. Page said the sanctions the U.S. has imposed on Russia may have come up in their discussion but “not directly.” </p>

<p>The transcript of Page’s testimony also revealed that he applauded a proposal to change the Republican party’s stance on Ukraine ahead of the 2016 Republican nominating convention. The amendment ensured that Ukraine would not be given weapons to fight Russian forces seeking to claim territory. “As for the Ukraine amendment, excellent work,” Page said in an email to Trump campaign official J.D. Gordon. Page defended the email, saying “it’s just expressing what I feel. Right?” Page told the committee he wrote to Mueller on Oct. 5, explaining that he intends to plead the Fifth Amendment and keep documents related to his work in Russia to himself. </p>

<p>As has been previously reported, Page acknowledged that he may have met with Russian Deputy Prime Minister Arkady Dvorkovich during the July 2016 trip. In an email on July 8, Page told Gordon that he received “some incredible insights” from his meetings with Russian legislators and a few members of the presidential administration,” according to the testimony. In a statement on Tuesday, Gordon said “I don’t recall all of Carter Page’s emails. I was getting thousands of emails on the campaign and didn’t read all of them.” Gordon said he discouraged Page from taking the trip to Moscow, so Page went around him to campaign leadership. [OCT 27: Carter Page meets with Senate Intel Committee] Video Will Begin In... 3 OCT 27: Carter Page meets with Senate Intel Committee 1:10 “During many public appearances prior to his November 2, 2017 testimony before the House Intelligence Committee in open session, Carter Page characterized his July 2016 trip to Russia as a private one in which his interactions with Russian individuals were largely confined to the &#39;man on the street,’” Schiff said. &quot;In his testimony, however, he was forced to acknowledge that he communicated with high level Russian officials while in Moscow, including one of Russia’s Deputy Prime Ministers. He also admitted notifying the fact of his meetings to his campaign supervisors. Page told NBC News Monday night that some lawmakers are focusing on &quot;irrelevant distractions.&quot; Last month he told NBC News, &quot;I&#39;m cooperating with everyone in D.C. who might want my assistance.&quot; </p>

<p>He called the Russia investigation a &quot;witch hunt that was sparked by the dodgy dossier in the months prior to November 2016.&quot; Page has been open about some of his contacts with Russian officials during and before the 2016 presidential campaign, including with former Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak. &quot;I&#39;m not going to deny that I talked with him,&quot; Page said in March on MSNBC&#39;s &quot;All In With Chris Hayes.&quot; In his testimony, Page acknowledged meeting with numerous senior individuals from Russian energy companies Rosneft and Gazprom in Moscow in July and December, according to an NBC News review of the transcript.</p>

<p>I suspect Page wasn’t willingly working for the FBI to ensnare Trump. They either arranged for him to work for Trump or else they just got lucky when he joined the campaign.</p>

<p>The reason I believe they didn’t just get lucky is because his background and contacts with a bunch of Russian energy officials is just too perfect.</p>

<p>The FBI is known for turning on their Confidential Informants.</p>

<p>If Page was “recommended” to the Trump campaign, you can bet the FBI was behind it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That reasoning is severely flawed.</p>

<p>If page were a UE, they wouldn&#39;t need a fisa warrant or even to spy on trump because they already would be.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t make sense.  Think about it.  They already had a man on the inside.</p>

<p>And if he were a ue, why would his testimony not be used to get a fisa warrant?   The word of a ue agent is good as gold as far as courts are concerned.  So why even bring up a dossier to the court?!  You wouldn&#39;t need to!!!</p>

<p>This is just the latest distraction because the memo fell flat.  It&#39;s silly and really half assed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="http://foreignpolicy.com/2013/07/18/3-degrees-of-separation-is-enough-to-have-you-watched-by-the-nsa/">FISA warrants typically grant several &quot;hops&quot;</a> worth of surveillance. So if you get a warrant for Page, you can monitor communications (and potentially unmask names) within 3 hops of his typical contacts. For someone working in a campaign, that definitely could get you right to the top advisors and managers. </p>

<p>In 1987, just three years after he attended the closing with Trump, Bogatin pleaded<sup><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/12/nyregion/brooklyn-fuel-distributor-pleads-guilty-in-tax-plot.html">1</a></sup> guilty to taking part in a massive gasoline-bootlegging scheme with Russian mobsters. After he fled the country, the government seized<sup><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1992/04/30/nyregion/entrepreneur-who-left-us-is-back-awaiting-sentence.html">2</a></sup> his five condos at Trump Tower, saying that he had purchased them to “launder money, to shelter and hide assets.” A Senate investigation into organized crime later revealed<sup><a href="https://archive.org/stream/russianorganized00unit/russianorganized00unit_djvu.txt">3</a></sup> that Bogatin was a leading figure in the Russian mob in New York. His family ties, in fact, led straight to the top: His brother ran<sup><a href="http://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/ruslobby-mogilevich-04172007.pdf">4</a></sup> a $150 million stock scam with none other than Semion Mogilevich, whom the FBI considers<sup><a href="https://www.villagevoice.com/1998/05/26/the-most-dangerous-mobster-in-the-world/">5</a></sup> the “boss of bosses” of the Russian mafia. At the time, Mogilevich—feared even by his fellow gangsters as “the most powerful mobster in the world”—was expanding his multibillion-dollar international criminal syndicate into America.</p>

<p>If you want to separate the different crimes that Donald Trump is alleged to have committed with Russian intelligence and Russian mafia figures into seperate bins, go right ahead.</p>

<p>But there was financed opposition research that went into detail about Donald Trump&#39;s long history of business and laundering practices with Russian and Kazakh organised crime figures.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its a fucking crazy time we&#39;re living in right now. People are fully aware the Fox is biased, yet they refuse to recognize that the rest of MSM is just as biased. So they willingly remain ignorant of what the actual story is because they believe what one side is telling them and refuse to see whatthe other side is saying.</p>

<p>It&#39;s fucking wild man. I&#39;ve NEVER seen the leftist media like this. They are completely overlooking facts and spinning and intentionally leaving shit out. Like for instance the story last week about how Nunes didn&#39;t actually see the underlying documents. There was a goddamn deal struck between the committee and the DOJ that allowed ONE person to view those documents. They fucking knew this and still everywhere I looked, because I do look at things besides Fox, they were pushing that narrative. They aren&#39;t even trying to hide their biases anymore. And there are so many cats out there that refuse to hear the other side and therefore are remaining completely uneducated about what is actually going on. Hand to god I used to consider myself a liberal. What the hell happened to the Democrat party that they are no longer on the side of civil liberties and transparencies? Weren&#39;t they pretty fucking hard on police last year? Yet know we&#39;re not allowed to question the  top cops in the US?</p>

<p>I find this spin absolutely ridiculous. For one, Steele (as in the Steele dossier) wasn&#39;t brought on board until the Clinton campaign/DNC ponied up all that cash to Fusion GPS. And secondly, your incorrect and are either ignorantly or intentionally spreading misinformation that the leftist media recently had to retract.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No it&#39;s not. That&#39;s a conclusion based on your opinion. You think the fucking media is able to verify this shit, really? They have the same spy contacts Steele does?</p>

<p>Steele had previously given the FBI info that led to arrests of FIFA execs. He&#39;s got credibility within the FBI. He brings them this dossier. Within it is stuff about Carter Page. Page was previously caught under surveillance of Russian spies, got a visit from the FBI. He&#39;s got a known history with Russian spies, and here he is on this dossier about Russian spy shit.</p>

<p>So you have a credible former British spy on one side and Carter Page on the other. It would be irresponsible police work if they didn&#39;t follow that lead, and Page makes the most sense to tap because they have actual proof he&#39;s been involved in shit like this before.</p>

<p>Who are the FISA executives Steele&#39;s tips led to arrests? Truly curious about this.</p>

<p>Page wasn&#39;t caught under surveillance. He was under surveillance and it&#39;s quite possible was actually working for the FBI, hence the OP&#39;s post. </p>

<p>Riddle me this. If Carter Page is a Russian spy who has been monitored on and off for many years, why no indictment? The cats outta the bag, so you cant claim that their trying to catch a bigger fish. So why let a Russian spy wonder aimlessly around the US?</p>

<p>It would be irresponsible police work not to vet tips that are brought to your attention. Which is precisely what happened when the FBI/DOJ took a dossier that the media couldn&#39;t verify to a FISA court to get a warrant to spy on Americans.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Carter Page wasn&#39;t a Russian spy, he just wanted to work with a couple of Russian spies, but ultimately they thought he was too stupid to bother with. He did not get arrested there because he wasn&#39;t actually recruited and didn&#39;t commit any crimes. But he was pretty close so he got a visit from the FBI and I&#39;m assuming a note in his FBI record. Regardless, his name came up related to Russia in the dossier, and that plus this previous spy contact was suspicious enough for a warrant to look into Page further.</p>

<p>What I&#39;m more curious about, have you seen the latest texts to drop? There&#39;s one in particular regarding the very thing you brought up.</p>

<p>On Sept. 28, 2016, Strzok wrote to Page, &quot;Got called up to Andy&#39;s [McCabe] earlier.. hundreds of thousands of emails turned over by Weiner&#39;s atty to sdny [Southern District of New York], includes a ton of material from spouse [Huma Abedin]. Sending team up tomorrow to review... this will never end.&quot;</p>

<p>Page was already working in Russian/Foreign investments. 2010 and on, FBI hits him up about his contacts, and they get FISA on him. 2013 Page works with FBI as an undercover Employee in the evgeny-buryakov case, from there, the FBI either purposefully planted Page within Trumps campaign in order to justify spying on him, or Page somehow miraculously made his own way there, and FBI used this to justify FISA warrants to blanket spy on the whole campaign</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The story is that the FBI put their own mole in the Trump campaign, then ran to the FISA court saying &quot;look at all the sleazy stuff this guy is involved in, we need to watch everything around him&quot; as justification for accessing all the mass data collected about the people he was in contact with.</p>

<p>Whether that&#39;s true or not, God knows (it would be nowhere near the dirtiest thing they&#39;ve ever done), but this is the allegation as I understand it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What up donut buddy. The shit just doesn&#39;t make any sense. So Comey comes out and says they are reviewing the case against Hillary&#39;s campaign mere weeks before the election. They never say they&#39;re investigating Trump. But somehow they&#39;re against Trump. </p>

<p>They didn&#39;t need an insurance plan. They just needed to say they were investigating Trump for ties to Russia because before this election the majority of Republicans weren&#39;t fond of Russia. Now we&#39;re stuck with Republicans aimed to take down Trump, not before he was elected but, after he was elected. Yet Republican congressmen keep doing his bidding. </p>

<p>This shit is stupid. Come the fuck on. Carter Page is some secret agent. No he&#39;s fucking not. Hell the Russians tried to get him on their team but decided he was too stupid. You ever watch a Carter Page interview? The guy is a nervous wreck. He yaps and shakes like a Chihuahua on speed. </p>

<p>When the fuck did conspiracies matter what fucking political party you&#39;re from? This blindly ignoring things that are true and blindly following shady fucks like Devin Nunes is insane to me. </p>

<p>Just sit back and think if you changed everything that said Donald Trump in these allegations to Hillary Clinton how this sub would react. </p>

<p>Yeah I get there&#39;s a lot of new people from &quot;both sides&quot; here. I&#39;ve been here for 3 years and yes I lean liberal, but come the fuck on. You can just bring up videos of Trump spewing bullshit, his son admitted going to a meeting to people who were part of Russia&#39;s government, you can look at Manafort&#39;s daughters text messages about their dad knowingly sending people to die but nothing fucking matters anymore. </p>

<p>I hope you guys are happy where we end up when this glorified carnie and his kin are done with us. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Tracy Beanz did an excellent video about Papadopolous the other day. She found out that P-Dop was scooped up by FBI after landing from Munich and released very quickly. She speculates that it was so that they could turn him into an informant. </p>

<p>Think the same thing might have happened to Carter Page??? </p>

<p>But the thing is...a Judge banned P-Dop from having communications with a certain list of individuals (probably the Trump campaign).</p>

<p>My question is tho: if P-Dop (or Page) was “singing” for the Feds, and a Judge banned him from having communications with the Trump Campaign, if either of them broke that and DID communicate, would any info acquired be admissible in court? 
My thoughts were that possibly the FBI had both of them working undercover for them to spy on Trump, and the arrest of (at least P-Dop) could have possibly been a setup so that this no contact order could be placed on him so that he didn’t have to wear a wire or obtain any damning info against Trump (in a weird legal loophole kind of way)...?</p>

<p>Its inaccurate to call Page an &quot;employee&quot; of the FBI since 2013 (he might have been, though, we don&#39;t know). He did, however, work with FBI agents and provided them with information that helped them convict a couple of Russian spies. The conspiracy part is that he was actually employed by the FBI in 2013, or that, after working with them, they used him again afterwards, including using him as a mole in the Trump campaign. None of that is disinfo, this is a conspiracy forum where we discuss potential conspiracies.</p>

<li><p>They used Page and the Steele dossier to get a warrant to spy on Trump.</p></li>
<li><p>Page isn&#39;t an employee but an Intel asset that was leveraged to get a warrant. Point is he&#39;s been cooperating with the FBI for a long time, even wore wires and served as a star witness for one of their cases. Answer to your question: the Steele dossier wasn&#39;t enough to get a warrant. Page was their Insurance policy, a known FBI guy that dealt with Russians before.</p></li>
<li><p>Warrant granted them ability to spy on everybody near Trump. That&#39;s the point. They needed Page/Steele for the warrant so they could spy on his entire team. They weren&#39;t spying on Page, that was never the point.</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>No, that&#39;s called a troll. A shill is somebody planted undercover by a group to fight against another group as a privateer of sorts. So apparently you don&#39;t know what a shill is either but its okay now you do. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shill">Here you go maybe this wikipedia article on Shill will make it easier for you.</a>. BTW what in this post can even be refuted? It&#39;s total nonsense that he cant support whatsoever but you want people to attack his ideas. What god damn ideas are you talking about? You mean the ideas he brings up that aren&#39;t even in regards to this post? You mean his distractions he uses to throw people off balance. His title is incorrect and the article posted doesn&#39;t say what he says it does. When you tell that to him he simply links to another reddit post and then simply demands you to show evidence otherwise. I know you are trying to white knight and save the day for this guy but he dug his own grave and there is nothing you can do.</p>

Its all circumstantial, but sure looks like this may be the case and if true would throw a bit of a wrench into the Carter Page was a Russian spy narrative being pushed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>FISA surveillance of Page did not start in 2013. Also they did not wait for Buzzfeed to report on the dossier before it was used for a FISA warrant. These seem to be the 2 points that are confusing some the most.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>And it would explain why the FBI/DOJ said that Nunes memo was a threat to national security by revealing sources and methods used. I&#39;d think that if this theory was in fact true, that there would be others in the bureau who would be aware. Some kind of paper work or something, right?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m at a loss as to why some think that this disproves Strzok&#39;s bias. He wrote a lot of Comey&#39;s letters.  Remember how he changed to wording of Clintons exoneration letter from &quot;grossly&quot; to &quot;extremely careless&quot;? I do. That was a Comey letter he helped write as well.</p>

<p>What I&#39;m more curious about, have you seen the latest texts to drop? There&#39;s one in particular regarding the very thing you brought up.</p>

<p>On Sept. 28, 2016, Strzok wrote to Page, &quot;Got called up to Andy&#39;s [McCabe] earlier.. hundreds of thousands of emails turned over by Weiner&#39;s atty to sdny [Southern District of New York], includes a ton of material from spouse [Huma Abedin]. Sending team up tomorrow to review... this will never end.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/02/07/more-texts-between-strzok-and-page-uncovered-lead-to-more-questions.html">http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/02/07/more-texts-between-strzok-and-page-uncovered-lead-to-more-questions.html</a></p>

<p>September 28 is a full month before Comey sent his letter to Congress, right? So how does that fit into the theory your trying to sell me?</p>
