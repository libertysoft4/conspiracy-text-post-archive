We are all grown here (let&#39;s say all of us for the sake of the argument). I am a grown man and if someone bans me, I just open another fucking account and still push my point through. People sometimes forget that they can control their own computer and website browsing choices and that they are not in the reddit kindergarden where you have to listen to the teachers and behave. You are a grown man god fucking damn it. No grown man should tell another how to behave. I&#39;ll leave you with this if mods bother you in the future... smile and nod brother-smile and nod.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi stratfor,</p>

<p>I appreciate you guys checking in with me from time to time.  I would like to make a request though.</p>

<p>It appears there is some incorrect information in your database file on me.  You guys really need some quality assurance procedures when people add info to the knowledge base on specific users.  It&#39;s really gone downhill over the last year.</p>

<p>For example, I only weigh 200lbs and someone put 260 in the database.  I think this error comes from an old post where I was weighing my dog by holding while I stood on the scales.  200 + dog = 260. </p>

<p>So anyways your data mining software failed to recognize the context or maybe it was an individual analyst.</p>

<p>Please correct this as I&#39;m very sensitive to my weight.  </p>

<p>Also Kekistan and GEOTUS are jokes that we&#39;re intended to trigger liberals so when you guys freak out about it, it doesn&#39;t look good.  </p>

<p>Have a great day/night whatever it is there.</p>
