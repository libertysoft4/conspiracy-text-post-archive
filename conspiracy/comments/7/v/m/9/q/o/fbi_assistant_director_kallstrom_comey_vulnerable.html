<p>Steele, author of the debunked Trump dossier</p>

<p>It&#39;s not debunked, it has been corroborated in several instances </p>

<p>which unlawfully formed the basis for a FISA warrant against President Trump’s team, </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Carter Page got his FISA warrant in October 2016 - after he had left the campaign. </p>

<p>Also we know from Nunes memo that George Papadopoulos actually caused the FBI to open their counter intelligence operation months earlier</p>

<p><a href="https://theintercept.com/2018/02/02/nunes-memo-fisa-trump-russia/">https://theintercept.com/2018/02/02/nunes-memo-fisa-trump-russia/</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>when FBI agents submit a FISA application to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, they use information from multiple sources, according to current and former FBI officials. What’s more, the same information is not used over and over to extend surveillance under FISA. Instead, every 90 days, the FBI, as a matter of practice, shows evidence to the court that agents are obtaining foreign intelligence information through the surveillance that is in line with the initial FISA application.</p>

<p>Nothing stopping him, evidently.    Is that how you like it?</p>

<p>We all know Trump is corrupt.   Problem is some of us seem to like the corruption of Obama or Hillary.</p>

<p>Yeah,  its a grey world,  but this made up Cold War against Russia by the party that just took down Libya and was trying to take down Syria is outrageous.     They didn&#39;t make all this war risk up for you and me,   they made it up for themselves.    </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The FISA warrant requires more evidence than one dossier.</p>

<p>FISA warrants require new evidence every time they are renewed.</p>

<p>Carter Page had at least 3 renewals.</p>

<p>That&#39;s 4 different times the FBI had to convince FISA judges that the warrants were necessary.</p>

<p>The judges agreed with the FBI.</p>

<p>So, for your theory that FISA courts are corrupt to be true - a dozen or so FBI agents working in tandem with several DOJ personnel conspired with the judges of the FISA court to unnecessarily monitor Carter Page, who had already left the Trump campaign.</p>

<p>If the FBI and DOJ wanted to taint Trump - why didn&#39;t they reveal publicly that they had a counter intelligence operation open because of Papadopoulos? Why did they not publicise Carter Pages FISA warrant before the election?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agree,   some parts do not make sense unless you realize this is not about the rule of law,   it is about politics,  a battle between two factions of elites against each other neither of which have any true commitment to transparency or the law,  BUT both of which have very strong survival instincts.</p>

<p>A book could be,  and will be written on the last weeks before the election,  probably starting with the Bill Clinton meeting with Loretta Lynch a week after one of Fusions reports was issued.</p>

<p>Other books have already been written that cover Trumps rise from a joke of a candidate to his surprise win and the huge reaction that followed.     But no book can cover what was really going on with Comey in those last weeks before the election.    We do know that Peter Strozek was privy to the way the investigation into Hillary email scandal had been handled and that the NY authorities handling Wiener were a loose cannon.</p>

<p>We also know the timing of the Wikileaks releases of material on Podesta and Hillary.</p>

<p>The election was close enough and the voting system obscure enough that we will never know how much some of the dirty tricks swung the outcome,   redistricting,   precincts with more votes than registered voters,   Russia adds on facebook,   there were issues on the margins.    But the bigger elephant in the room is that a rich white male biggot could grab votes from a population the Republicans had long written off or why so many who had supported Obama wouldn&#39;t raise a finger for Hillary.    The Democrats and liberals in general are wasting their time as if Pence would be any better except cosmetically.</p>

<p>The real issues are not in the orange idiot.   Rome is burning.</p>

<p>It appears he was able to put his personal bias aside and judged the matter on its merits. Which is exactly what you want from law enforcement.</p>

<p>How does this tie in with your battle of the elite factions?</p>

<p>To me this suggests the FBI was non-partisan in its work, it is only since Trump took office and repeatedly attacked the FBI that this issue even arose. </p>

<p>He incorrectly references the nunes memo. And sites Uranium One. He&#39;s a hack.</p>

<p>Shit is not about to go down. Clinton will never be arrested for Uranium One. And Obama will never see a single arrest of anyone of his WH aides. Ever. </p>

<p>Trump might try to fire Mueller though, which is what seems to be the goal of these strories. In that sense: yes, shit might go down. </p>

<p>Your titles is broken. You post is a mistake. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>you say it appears, while we already know it wasn&#39;t. the dutch intel started the investigation. hillary nor obama started the investigation on their own for political benefit.</p>

<p>hillary was already anti-putin. as a career politician she has the money, knowledge and duty to take an extra step to see what&#39;s going on in the world. if she paid a company to <strong>continue</strong> looking into something that was already started for a republican group, how is that inappropriate?</p>

<p>hillary is twice removed in all of this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Dutch are one of the most willing enablers of the US.    We already know there are thousands of corrupt Russian expats lending money to casino mobsters.    </p>

<p>Why isn&#39;t it obvious that the oligarchs have taken over everywhere,  that the Podestas and Manaforts and Fusions are willing to take money from any filthy hand.</p>

<p>Especially now that it looks like Obama was personally harvesting over at the FBI.</p>

<p>If any real charges start getting filed,   the will have to shut down Washington DC its a farce.    Taking sides with Trump or Hillary/Obama is looking stupider by the day.</p>

<p>We could have been fixing the basic system instead of feeding in by playing along with this fake drama.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agree,   some parts do not make sense unless you realize this is not about the rule of law,   it is about politics,  a battle between two factions of elites against each other neither of which have any true commitment to transparency or the law,  BUT both of which have very strong survival instincts.</p>

<p>A book could be,  and will be written on the last weeks before the election,  probably starting with the Bill Clinton meeting with Loretta Lynch a week after one of Fusions reports was issued.</p>

<p>Other books have already been written that cover Trumps rise from a joke of a candidate to his surprise win and the huge reaction that followed.     But no book can cover what was really going on with Comey in those last weeks before the election.    We do know that Peter Strozek was privy to the way the investigation into Hillary email scandal had been handled and that the NY authorities handling Wiener were a loose cannon.</p>

<p>We also know the timing of the Wikileaks releases of material on Podesta and Hillary.</p>

<p>The election was close enough and the voting system obscure enough that we will never know how much some of the dirty tricks swung the outcome,   redistricting,   precincts with more votes than registered voters,   Russia adds on facebook,   there were issues on the margins.    But the bigger elephant in the room is that a rich white male biggot could grab votes from a population the Republicans had long written off or why so many who had supported Obama wouldn&#39;t raise a finger for Hillary.    The Democrats and liberals in general are wasting their time as if Pence would be any better except cosmetically.</p>

<p>The real issues are not in the orange idiot.   Rome is burning.</p>
