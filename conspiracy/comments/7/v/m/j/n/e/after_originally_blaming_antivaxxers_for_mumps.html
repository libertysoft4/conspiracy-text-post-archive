<p>&quot;adults should get a booster of MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine if they’re at risk during a mumps outbreak, ACIP says.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Immunity from the MMR vaccine can wane over time in some people, and the booster dose brings it back up.&quot;</p>

<p>Show me where it has &quot;effectively been admitted&quot;? You&#39;re calling a natural behaviour of biology &quot;vaccine failure&quot;. The efficacy declines over time and it&#39;s never 100%, that&#39;s well known and understood and why booster shots are recommended not because the vaccine failed.</p>

<p>That wasn&#39;t what doctors were saying before this. After the childhood MMR doses, adults were supposed to be protected throughout life, enough such that an adult booster was not seen as necessary.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So we need to clarify definitions here. Efficacy vs. effectiveness:</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine_efficacy">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine_efficacy</a></p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine#Effectiveness">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine#Effectiveness</a></p>

<p>What you&#39;re saying is more in line with effectiveness. Meaning the actual measured protection in a population at a given time.</p>

<p>What I&#39;ve been talking about is <em>efficacy</em>, and by that I mean how effective the vaccine is at its peak effectiveness under ideal conditions.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like talking about the quality of an automobile. If you ask &quot;how well does that car run?&quot;, there are two meanings. Do you mean how well did that car ran when it was new? Or how well does that car run <em>right now</em>, say, after 20 years.</p>

<p>So let me restate my question. Do you think that the ultimate ability of the MMR vaccine itself to prevent illness is still at the same level it was 30 years ago? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t believe that is possible to state definitively.

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

<p>Yeah, I agree about this. Can&#39;t say anything <em>for sure</em> at this point, scientifically speaking. But there are two items of concern - and bring up the question of why the vaccine would appear (recently) to be less effective than when first introduced. 1) What&#39;s is the reason (or reasons) for the recent outbreaks and new recommendation for adults boosters? 2) Viral mutation against prophylaxis is not unheard of, and somewhat expected given evolutionary processes.</p>

<p>This is an article about viral mutation in influenza (not mumps but still a virus). Note that the title is misleading. They&#39;re proposing that the virus is what mutated, not the chicken eggs:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/vaccine-information-center/mutations-in-chicken-eggs-weaken-flu-vaccine-effectiveness/article/709352/">https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/vaccine-information-center/mutations-in-chicken-eggs-weaken-flu-vaccine-effectiveness/article/709352/</a></p>

<p>Here&#39;s an article about vaccine driven evolution of influenza virus:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28686463">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28686463</a></p>

<p>And there&#39;s this article about the mumps vaccine:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3255929/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3255929/</a></p>

<p>Note that their conclusion is that there is &quot;no evidence of immune escape&quot;, however this study was conducted <em>in vitro</em> not clinically, and they&#39;re assuming that they&#39;re making some assumptions that their assays reflect real world efficacy.</p>

<p>From the abstract:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Although the geometric mean neutralizing antibody titer of the sera was lower against some virus strains than others, all viruses were readily neutralized, arguing against immune escape.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In lay terms, some reduction in the antibody response was observed, but they&#39;re saying this shouldn&#39;t matter.</p>

<p>What I&#39;m suggesting is that this study might be making simple assumptions about a complex infection process. For example, in an actual human host, the virus may be replicating faster than before, so while antibodies may still recognize the viral proteins, the resulting human immune response may not be enough to overwhelm the virus.</p>

<p>Again, this isn&#39;t an argument saying that I know what&#39;s going on. I&#39;m saying that it&#39;s too early to simply blame anti-vaxxers entirely. It&#39;s possible that the vaccine just isn&#39;t creating the same level of immunity as it used to.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been following this lawsuit ever since I did research after the Anthrax vaccine almost took my life. Here is a quote with link which updates people on the case against Merk! </p>

<p><a href="https://www.skepticalraptor.com/skepticalraptorblog.php/merck-mumps-motions-whistleblowers-the-actual-story/#Update_2_31_January_2016">https://www.skepticalraptor.com/skepticalraptorblog.php/merck-mumps-motions-whistleblowers-the-actual-story/#Update_2_31_January_2016</a></p>

<p>&quot;Update 2 (31 January 2016)</p>

<p>The court ordered that discovery, the process of gathering evidence, must be completed by 1 March 2017, over a year from now. The court also ordered that expert discovery needs to be completed by 31 October 2017.</p>

<p>Even further into the future, other motions must be filed by 20 December 2017. A motion for class actioncertification must be filed by 1 March 2018, two years from now. And finally, the defendant, Merck, must file it’s opposition to class certification by 5 April 2018&quot;</p>

<p>Disclaimer: I believe vaccines can work in theory just like I believe governments can work in theory. On paper it all looks fine, but in practice there are issues, and there appear to be problems. These things must be addressed as they are very important matters for the future of humanity.</p>

<p>There has been huge controversy surrounding the DOD&#39;s use of the anthrax shot and BT Vaccines on their own soldiers, which were mentioned in congressionally mandated reports in 2012 and 2013 as the likely cause or causes of the 11 symptoms which became known as Gulf War Syndrome. This was just before the council suspiciously backed off exposure-related and stuck instead to mental-related for the cause to GWS</p>

<p>The DOD made it illegal to not take a shot in 2009 (UCMJ), and in 2011 began their own department for the creation of counter-bio-weapons (vaccines). Perhaps they did this because Merk pharma has been embroiled in lawsuits by ex employees that all have data evidencing their allegations that Merk fudged saftey and efficacy data for over 20 years to retain patents. The DOD requires the same shots for DOD Civilians as it does for it&#39;s soldiers.</p>

<p>The DOD is and has been allowed to use New Investigational Drugs on soldiers, but after John D. Rockafeller stood before Congress (1994) and told the people that their government had likely caused a debacle by testing things on troops that may have consequences, Congress told the DOD to use documents to inform people before they give them the shot. They mandated other things including an investigation which is still ongoing as I mentioned above the reports. It&#39;s a grey area for if people have a choice (they do but are told they don&#39;t).</p>

<p>In 1991 Australia changed their formula after 90 percent of the first troops came back from the person gulf with what later became known as Gulf War Syndrome. The US did not change their formula, which included an adjuvant called squaline that science later found reason not to trust. Squaline was included in an innoculation in Spain a while back, so I know its still in use in places, in spite of the controversy surrounding it.</p>

<p>Here is my story from when I provided evidence that anthrax shot is still a danger to humans as of July 2011. The anthrax shot almost took my life and they swept it under the rug. <a href="https://joshua-ray.livejournal.com/180493.html">https://joshua-ray.livejournal.com/180493.html</a></p>

<p>Either way it&#39;s good to get the status of the case from the opposite side of the isle, so people can see the case does in fact exist, and here is the status. Beyond that nobody knows if the allegations are true or not, and we should all be waiting with baited breath...ok you should breath normally, actually. It may take a while </p>

Deliberately misdiagnosing patients to defraud health insurance 3. Prescribing a dangerous drug to treat autism, even though there was no evidence supporting the treatment. Basically, he was doing unmonitored human experimentation on autistic kids, and probably doing serious longterm harm to his patients/victims. Dangerous, obvious malpractice, motivated by money, but he is some kind of a hero to these people. </p>

<p>Fact: unvaccinated people are spreading measles. Look at the list of outbreaks. The cdc hasnt &quot;backed down&quot; on that. Outright, boldfaced lie. 
Fact: the measles vaccine is very effective. Minnesota outbreak, linked above. 8500 people exposed. 65 cases. Number in vaccinated individuals:3 pretty impressive considering measles is one of the most infectious diseases known to man.</p>

<p>Fact: nobody claims vaccines are 100% effective, or don&#39;t lose efficacy over time, especially the cdc. Easy solution-get a blood titer and a booster. Not a conspiracy, and if it was it would be a conspiracy to sell less booster shots, which would make no sense according to the whole &quot;evil vaccine industry selling dangerous stuff because of muh profits&quot; right?</p>

<p>That&#39;s a lie. What the cdc actually says:</p>

<p>Mumps outbreaks can still occur in highly vaccinated U.S. communities, particularly in close-contact settings. In recent years, outbreaks have occurred in schools, colleges, and camps. However, high vaccination coverage helps limit the size, duration, and spread of mumps outbreaks. MMR vaccine prevents most, but not all, cases of mumps and complications caused by the disease. Two doses of the vaccine are 88% (range: 66 to 95%) effective at protecting against mumps; one dose is 78% (range: 49% to 92%) effective. Studies have shown that the MMR vaccine protects against currently circulating mumps strains.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In case you want to talk just about mumps outbreaks with the vaccinated, here you go!</p>

<p>&quot;The epidemic here has slowed since its peak last autumn. But what happened in Springdale has ramifications far beyond the gently rolling hills of the northwest corner of this state. Large and lengthy mumps outbreaks have been reported in multiple places across the US over the past couple of years and, worryingly, often among people who have been vaccinated against the disease.&quot;</p>

<p>AND </p>

<p>&quot;In Arkansas, health departments sometimes resorted to giving extra doses of the mumps vaccine to try to build immunity in certain people — and some of them still got sick.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.statnews.com/2017/03/29/mumps-outbreaks/">https://www.statnews.com/2017/03/29/mumps-outbreaks/</a></p>

<p>&quot;This report describes a mumps outbreak at a university in New York City, where mumps is a reportable disease. The index case, involving unilateral parotitis in a university student, was reported on January 12, 2014. Mumps serology was negative, and a mumps diagnosis was thereby considered ruled out. A second student, exposed to the first, presented to the university health service on January 31, 2014, but did not undergo diagnostic testing. By February 19, 2014, the health center reported five cases, including the index case, to the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene.</p>

<p>Eventually, 56 cases were reported: 50% laboratory confirmed by immunoglobulin M (IgM) serology or real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and 50% considered probable mumps. The researchers established an epidemiological link among all cases. Ninety-six percent of cases occurred in vaccinated people, of whom 57% had two doses. Laboratory testing was performed on 93% of the cases. Of 40 tested by RT-PCR, 68% were positive, but only 5% of 44 tested by IgM serology were positive. Positive testing for RT-PCR was more likely in specimens tested within 2 days of symptom onset, while the reverse is true for serologic testing.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.jwatch.org/na43091/2017/01/04/mumps-outbreak-vaccinated-population">https://www.jwatch.org/na43091/2017/01/04/mumps-outbreak-vaccinated-population</a></p>

<p>&quot;From October 1988 to April 1989, a large mumps outbreak occurred in Douglas County, Kansas. Of the 269 cases, 208 (77.3%) occurred among primary and secondary school students, of whom 203 (97.6%) had documentation of mumps vaccination.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022347605807267">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022347605807267</a></p>

<p>There is plenty more evidence of mumps outbreaks in highly vaccinated populations if you want them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nobody is denying that. Especially not the cdc. The mumps vaccine doesnt work as well as other vaccines, especially if you only get one dose. Whats missing from your list is the number of exposures. Do you have that number? As in, how many people were exposed and didnt get sick? Or numbers about the incidence of severe complications, relative to unvaccinated individuals?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, because the CDC will not do comparison studies between vaccinated vs unvaccinated individuals, as you should already know.</p>

<p>But I am happy to hear that you concede that the mumps part of the vaccine is ineffective and I assume you must also by extension agree that the measles part is ineffective as well as the same outbreaks happen in highly vaccinated populations as well. The MMR vaccine is completely ineffective.</p>

<p>So one more time, what is the point of getting a toxic, potentially harmful and ineffective vaccine that provides little to no immunity even in highly vaccinated populations when getting these diseases naturally will provide LIFETIME IMMUNITY?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll go backward through your lies here. You get that people die from measles? Babies, mostly? And if you can vaccinate to prevent that, less babies die? And that not vaccinating will result in a large pile of dead babies? You...understand all that right? That would be why.
Measles vaccine is highly effective. Thats why, wait for it, almost nobody gets measles anymore. Large scale measles outbreaks dont happen in highly vaccinated populations. Total horseshit. Even though the mumps vaccine isnt as good as the measles vaccine, it&#39;s still much better than not having the vaccine. Less people get it, and its not as serious. We actually do have comparisons, because there is plenty of prevaccine data. If you want, i can post how orchitus incidence is greatly reduced, overall cases are way down, etc. One part of the vaccine is less effective than the other, so both are ineffective...youre not embarrassed when you post reasoning that flawed? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What A fine tapestry of lies. Lets go through your own examples.</p>

<p>Your example: In 1985, 69 secondary cases, all in one generation, occurred in an Illinois high school after exposure to a vigorously coughing index case. The school&#39;s 1,873 students had a pre-outbreak vaccination level of 99.7% by school records.</p>

<p>From 1985. One dose of the vaccine, 67/1873 means 96.5% did not get the virus, because they were vaccinated.</p>

<p>French outbreak:</p>

<p>Although few measles cases were reported in France during 2006 and 2007, suggesting the country might have been close to eliminating the disease, a dramatic outbreak of &gt;20,000 cases occurred during 2008–2011. Adolescents and young adults accounted for more than half of cases; median patient age increased from 12 to 16 years during the outbreak. The highest incidence rate was observed in children &lt;1 year of age, reaching 135 cases/100,000 infants during the last epidemic wave. Almost 5,000 patients were hospitalized, including 1,023 for severe pneumonia and 27 for encephalitis/myelitis; 10 patients died. More than 80% of the cases during this period occurred in unvaccinated persons
<a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/19/3/12-1360_article">https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/19/3/12-1360_article</a></p>

<p>So in other words, a bunch of idiots didnt get vaccinated and caused an outbreak. You cant explain the disparity between affected  populations either. If the vaccine is ineffective, the majority of cases  should be among people that are vaccinated. Instead, it&#39;s almost entirely idiots who didnt get vaccinated. How totally unsurprising.</p>

<p>Eurosurveilance study, which you linked and probably didnt read beyond the abstract. &quot;However, even within the Netherlands, the outbreak did not spread to the wider community. Instead it affected mostly the Dutch Bible Belt, which consists of a large cluster of families with low vaccination coverage (from &lt; 80% to 90–95% [29]), inspired by their religious beliefs. &quot;</p>

<p>None of these links, that you provided, supprt your bullshit claims.</p>

<p>And your central thesis, which I love is that measles, mumps and polio cases dropped because of &quot;sanitation&quot;. Putting aside how ridiculous the idea that people were flinging shit out out the window in 1965, but by 1970 everyone suddenly got indoor plumbing, and in africa people still fling shit out the window and yet don&#39;t get polio...your idiotic conspiracy theory has a couple fatal flaws.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>You can see these disease causing agents under the microscope. You claim that doctors no longer found it &quot;fashionable&quot; to diagnose measles. Every lab has to be in on the scam! So does everybody else! Nothing else looks like measles, it&#39;s super obvious! So what you are claiming is that everybody, all at once, decided to ignore measles cases. Ridiculous. </p></li>
<li><p>Measles and rubella vaccines were introduced in the late 60&#39;s. Polio vaccine was introduced in the late 50&#39;s. There is a ten year spread there. So how is it that sanitation improve so much it cures polio, but doesnt do jack shit for measles or rubella for another ten years, when another advance in sanitation that you can&#39;t explain cures that suddenly at exactly the same time as the vaccine is introduced? </p></li>
</ol>

<p>I&#39;m all done with this back and forth. Whatever piece of evidence I produce, you&#39;ll ignore it, and produce 5 more lies. Because you&#39;re a liar. </p>

<p>As for the Illinois case, you sure seem to get stuck on how many people catch something. It doesn&#39;t matter as the vast majority of those students were vaccinated as the school had a vaccination rate of 99.7%. Not all kids will get sick during an outbreak.

You are saying that people not getting measles after having been exposed, exactly in line with the stated effectiveness of the vaccine is somehow irrelevant. Fucking ridiculous. Your own fucking example shows exactly how effective this vaccine is. </p>

<p>You need to admit that those outbreaks in europe were 1. Tiny relative pre vaccine incidence 2. Largely confined to people too stupid to get the vaccine. Your own sources repeatedly cite poor vaccine compliance as the cause of the outbreak. </p>

<p>Here, lets prove it. You post the annual number of people who used to get measles in europe. Then post the number of people that got sick during the recent outbreaks. Then post the percentage of cases in people who werent vaccinated. I&#39;ll do it, actually. Its 80%. Again, given the stated effectiveness of the vaccine, and vaccine coverage, these numbers are exactly as expected. That&#39;s all from your own sources. </p>

<p>The point you are making best here is that people should get booster shots in line with cdc recommendations. Also, they should actually read the links that liars like you provide as proof. Both good takeaways.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The source of the information is your own link, as i stated. Do the math for : number of exposures x 0.03....holy hell, would you look at that, its almost the same number as cases of measles. Well golleeeeeegee, its a really head scratcher i know......youd almost have to admit that the only people claiming vaccines are 100% effective are anti vaxx whackjobs. </p>

<p>As for the big list of links that show the cause and effect of vaccine administration, ill get to it, so just wait a bit. In the interim, it is a simple google search away for anyone, search pre vaccine cases x disease, then look at post vaccine numbers for years immediately following the widespread introduction of vaccine. Works with any disease, any time, any country. Really ideally youd want a chart of administered doses or vaccinated individuals as a percent of population, but thats pretty granular. </p>

<p>Like i said, dont have time for a research project at the minute, but i will get to it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You do realize just saying your math adds up without showing the work isn&#39;t even acceptable in school, right? Guess we will take your word for now.</p>

<p>In the meantime, here is more evidence for you with actual scientific studies, concluding proper sanitation and clean food/water supply actually decreased disease and not vaccines.</p>

<p>&quot;A brilliant report in 1977 by McKinlay JB and McKinlay SM questioned &quot;the contribution of medical measures to the decline of mortality in the United States in the twentieth century &quot; Mem Fund Q Health Soc. 1977 Summer; 55(3): 405-28.</p>

<p>Two centuries of UK, USA and Australian official death statistics have shown conclusively and scientifically that modern medicine is not responsible for and played little part in substantially improved life expectancy and survival from disease in western economies.</p>

<p>Historically, vaccines have not been viewed as inherently toxic by the regulatory agencies. The resulting lack of evidence of causality between vaccinations and serious adverse outcomes has thus been filled with an assumption that vaccines are safe.</p>

<p>Based on statistics from the Federal Statistics Office in Wiesbaden, Buchwald published a paper containing long-term observations of morbidity and mortality from infectious diseases. The following charts present the collected data indicating the year of introduction of the vaccines.&quot;</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a PDF of the study concluding sanitation was the cause, not vaccines.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a PDF linking to a report published in 1977 making the same conclusions.</p>

<p>&quot;Child Health Safety has compiled an excellent report on data the drug industry do not want you to see. Here are two centuries of UK, USA and Australian official death statistics which show conclusively and scientifically that modern medicine is not responsible for and played little part in substantially improved life expectancy and survival from disease in western economies.</p>

<p>The main advances in combating disease over 200 years have been better food and clean drinking water.  Improved sanitation, less overcrowded and better living conditions also contribute. This is also borne out in published peer reviewed research:&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There you go, fucking lying again. You should concede that your own examples show 97% immunity from the measles vaccine, exactly in line with stated effectiveness. You should also concede that you have no explanation for the miracle cure that magically drops vaccine preventable illness down to nothing the moment vaccines are introduced. Vaccine gets introduced, incidence drops to nothing, over and over again, in different times and different countries. </p>

<p>You can&#39;t explain it, and instead respond with more blatant lies. 6000 people a year used to die in the united states alone from measles. How many died last year? You want to share that number with the group? I want to here you say it, because it shows how blatant your lies are. People get vaccinated, with a vaccine that is 97% effective according to your own sources, so that 6000 people per year, mostly babies, don&#39;t die in agony. Im certain you will once again respond by claiming i have &quot;conceded&quot; without addressing any of the clear facts i have provided. Because that&#39;s the only way people such as yourself argue, with a shotgun full of blatant lies. </p>

<p>Your attempts to troll idiots into not vaccinating their children so you can watch the inevitable outbreaks and laugh are painfully obvious. Find a different way to get your kicks. This is sick. </p>

Until you answer this one question I have asked you time and time again I will not entertain your constant screams of &quot;Liar&quot; which you cannot back up. </p>

<p>WHAT IS THE POINT OF TAKING AN ADMITTEDLY INEFFECTIVE AND POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS VACCINE WHICH PROVIDES LITTLE TO NO IMMUNITY WHEN GETTING THE REAL DISEASE PROVIDES LIFETIME IMMUNITY???</p>

<p>You side-step it all the time because you cannot answer it. You also cannot answer how outbreaks occur in highly vaccinated populations if the MMR vaccine is effective.</p>

<p>Go back and reread all the evidence I provided and you will find I supplied you with mortality data that showed all diseases declining DRAMATICALLY BEFORE THE INTRODUCTION OF VACCINES! I will not supply that info for you again as you will not read it but it is there in my comments to you and you had no answer for it other than to state I was lying.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just explained why people should get vaccines. It so dramatically less people get sick and die. The cost of &quot;natural immunity&quot; is thousands of preventable deaths every year, an obvious fact which you are choosing to ignore. I have, in fact, repeatedly explained that vaccines are not 100% effective, and your own examples show just how effective they are. Nobody is hiding the fact that vaccines are not 100% effective. Nobody is hiding the fact that you might need a booster. </p>

<p>And your claim that all diseases were on the decline just before a vaccine gets introduced is just blatantly false. I encourage anyone reading this to check that entirely bullshit claim. The incidence of any disease drops, in line with vaccination, across different times, across different countries, with different diseases. Please explain the &quot;hygeine improvement&quot; that has cured chicken pox. Id love to hear you explain away that one. I&#39;m calling you a liar, repeatedly, because you are knowingly making false statements. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Where are all the deaths of unvaccinated children from measles, mumps, and rubella today. Seeing as it is the vaccine, not proper sanitation and cleaner food/water, that &quot;cured&quot; and eliminated these deaths from those vaccinated (even though outbreaks continue to happen in highly vaccinated populations), we should see numerous dead unvaccinated children from these diseases, correct?</p>

<p>Please explain, if sanitation did not have a bigger effect than vaccines on the elimination of these diseases, the declining mortality data I already supplied you from the US and other countries long before the introduction of vaccines. Please also source your claims as I, nor anyone else with brains, will not just take your word for it.</p>

<p>Some people have jobs, and mine isnt arguing with people on the internet, or shilling for big farma, so i get to it when i get to it.found a book for you. Hey, look at that correlation. In poor countries too. How totally unsurprising.</p>

<p>I mean, you&#39;ll probably still fuck it up, because being despite being told repeatedly that being fully, up to date vaccinated is around 97% effective, you are still stuck on that. And this is more complicated. But hey, whatever.</p>

<p>Ive got a bonus question for you. If sanitation and good diet magically protect you from measles, how come unvaccinated people are getting measles at all in developed countries? Shouldn&#39;t they be immune? And why are measles outbreaks so effectively confined to clusters of unvaccinated people? </p>

<p>I have to say, i should be thanking you. I did a bunch of reading about vaccines, and found it really inspiring. We&#39;re on the brink of completely curing polio. Measles is probably next. I get that you don&#39;t think thats great, but i think it&#39;s pretty amazing. </p>

<p>WHAT ASPECTS OF GIDEON CAN BE MODIFIED BY THE END-USER?</p>

<p>&quot;In addition to published materials, GIDEON relies on user input to provide corrections and new information – which after verification appear in the next update. Provide feedback.</p>

<p>The Personal Notes box allows users or admins to add additional information relevant to their practice or insitution.&quot;</p>

<p>WHY ARE SOME REFERENCES IN GIDEON LINKED TO INFORMATION FROM PROMED? DOES THIS AFFECT THE STATUS OF GIDEON AS AN EVIDENCE BASED MEDICINE DATABASE?-</p>

<p>Although ProMED often quotes news agencies, we have opted to enter these links for two reasons:
1. These are often the only citations for a given outbreak. Since the reader can now access the source they can easily judge the credibility of the note, thus fulfilling the requirement for evidence-based material. Many of these ProMED references relate to outbreaks in underdeveloped countries and remote areas, and may never find expression in more ‘credible’ publications.</p>

<p>HOW DOES GIDEON CIRCUMVENT THE AMBIGUITY OF LESS ACCURATE INFORMATION, I.E. &quot;SUSPECTED&quot; VS &quot;REPORTED&quot; VS &quot;CONFIRMED&quot; CASES...?-</p>

<p>The reliability of information in GIDEON is only as reliable as the primary source. As such, “suspect cases” , “reported outbreaks” etc are quoted as given with a reference link.</p>

<p>You keep harping on the unvaccinated children getting measles yet you continue to ignore the vast amount of evidence I provided showing outbreaks in highly vaccinated populations. If you believe vaccines cured these diseases, how are populations with a 99.7% vaccination rate getting outbreaks? You continually avoid that and provide no answer.</p>

<p>I will thank you as your persistence on trying to disprove me has allowed me to find better and better evidence to use to disprove you and the vaccine lie. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can confirm those numbers from other sources. Vaccine gets introduced, numbers go down. The higher the rate of vaccinations, the lower the rate of measles. This is independent of the level of sanitation and nutrition, as you can see. </p>

<p>The vaccine isnt 100% effective. You are  only one making that claim. 10000 people get exposed to measles. 800 of them are unvaccinated. 97% effective vaccine yields 300 measles cases in vaccinated individuals. 90% of the unvaccinated people get measles, so there are another 720 cases. Widespread outbreak in a highly vaccinated population, with cases largely confined to unvaccinated individuals, just like your own examples. Also worth noting how it doesnt spread to millions of people as it often did pre vaccine.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Please show me your numbers backing your claims as well as all of the independent sources backing them up. As you should know by now, we go off of SOURCES here not word of mouth. You keep claiming that all of these unvaccinated outbreaks occur while ignoring all of the evidence proving just as many occur in highly vaccinated populations. Where are all of the measles deaths of all these unvaccinated kids if it is such an epidemic without vaccination? </p>

<p>Looks like vaccines kill more children than actual measles!!! Here is some more WELL-SOURCED information for you to ignore!</p>

<p>&quot;Parents concerned about their vaccinated children potentially contracting measles from unvaccinated children may want to consider the fact that the bigger health threat is technically the vaccine, not the disease itself. Comparative data provided by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) reveal that nobody has died from measles in more than 10 years, while at least 108 deaths reported in VAERS during the same time frame have been linked to measles vaccines.&quot;</p>

<p>AND</p>

<p>“What you may not have heard, is that by 1963, the death rate from measles in the United States had already dropped by approximately 98%,” explains the International Medical Council on Vaccination (IMCV).</p>

<p>Not long after it was introduced, the first measles vaccine was actually found to manifest worse symptoms of measles in vaccinated patients than if they hadn’t gotten the vaccine at all. The vaccine also suppressed the normal rash and fever associated with measles, obstructing the normal immune response and ultimately leading to future health problems for vaccinated individuals once they reached adulthood.</p>

<p>“[W]hereas natural measles exposure generally left the person with reliable lifelong immunity, measles vaccines leave the individual with waning immunity,” adds IMCV. “This dynamic of waning immunity means we will probably see measles epidemics even in highly vaccinated populations.”</p>

<p><a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.globalresearch.ca/measles-vaccines-kill-more-people-than-measles-cdc-data-proves/5429736/amp">https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.globalresearch.ca/measles-vaccines-kill-more-people-than-measles-cdc-data-proves/5429736/amp</a></p>

<p>In a tragic turn in South Sudan, an effort to protect 15 children ended up killing them.</p>

<p>The children, all under age 5, died of severe sepsis and toxicity due to a botched vaccination campaign, according to a joint statement issued Thursday by UNICEF and the World Health Organization.</p>

<p>The vaccine had been left unrefrigerated. One syringe was reused over the course of four days.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2017/06/02/531268150/a-botched-vaccine-campaign-for-measles-killed-15-children-in-south-sudan">https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2017/06/02/531268150/a-botched-vaccine-campaign-for-measles-killed-15-children-in-south-sudan</a></p>

<p>Measles vaccine injuries have been compensated through the NVICP</p>

<p>469 families have been compensated through the NVICP for death, brain damage or disability from the MMR vaccine alone.59 families have been compensated for death from a measles vaccine.So far, the NVICP has awarded over $3.4 billion to over 5,250 victims of vaccine injury, nearly half of whom suffered permanent brain damage.  An analysis of a sampling of those compensated for vaccine-induced brain damage (encephalopathy or seizure disorders) shows that nearly 50% of them have autism.(2)</p>

<p>AND</p>

<p>How many Minnesotans are dying of measles?</p>

<p>Minnesota Department of Health Commissioner Ed Ehlinger falsely stated in a radio interview that “we would have thousands of children dying in our community each year” if people chose to let their children get the measles rather than take the risk of them getting autism from the MMR vaccine.(3)</p>

<p>In actuality, deaths from the measles had become extremely rare (averaging less than 5 per year in the entire state – not just in “our community”) BEFORE a vaccine for the measles was even licensed in Minnesota.</p>

<li>Have a look at India. Polio is eradicated by proper sanitation/nutrition. Vaccines are causing worse cases of vaccine induced polio where if they focused on improved sanitation/water/food, the disease would be eradicated without causing an even worse condition in its place.</li>
</ol>

<p>&quot;Polio in IndiaPolio is known to thrive in fecal matter, and is found in areas where sanitation is poor. Immunization efforts have taken credit for making the country “polio free” as deemed by the World Health Organization. However in 2009, India reported 762 cases of polio, the highest in the world at that time. Since 2014, there are no “official” documented cases of polio, but without proper sanitation this is sure to change.India has a population of 1.2 billion, making it the second most populous country in the world. Currently, 780 million Indians do not have a toilet; 96 million Indians do not have access to clean drinking water.</p>

<p>The efforts to improve sanitation in the area has been eclipsed by the effort to vaccinate instead, trying to fix the problem rather than prevent it. Over 9 billion has been spent in a vaccination campaign, and in some parts of India children have received as many as 30 doses of the oral polio vaccine before they turn 5. Vaccines are being pushed on people who don’t even have access to safe drinking water by the Bill Gates Foundation, the World Health Organization, and GAV.</p>

<p> The current vaccine situation has been met with anger after 53,000 cases of NPAFP, a non-polio acute flaccid paralysis, occurred in those who had been vaccinated. NPAFP is a disease that is clinically indistinguishable from polio but has double the death rate. As the rates of vaccines went up and down, the cases of NPAFP matched it.It would be a much better solution to spend money on better sanitation rather than trying to paper over the cracks by handing out these dangerous vaccines.&quot;</p>

<p>Vaccine Campaigns and Increases In Deadly Polio-Like Disease in Children</p>

<p>A paper published earlier this year in the Indian Journal of Medical Ethics should have made headlines around the globe, as it estimated there were 47,500 cases of a polio-like condition linked to children in India receiving repeated doses of  oral polio vaccine in 2011 alone. The incidence of non-polio Accute Flaccid Paralysis (AFP) in India is now 12 times higher than expected and coincides with huge increases in OPV doses being given to children in the quest to “eradicate” wild type polio infection and paralysis.</p>

<p>Researchers reported:2</p>

<p>“…while India has been polio-free for a year, there has been a huge increase in non-polio acute flaccid paralysis (NPAFP). In 2011, there were an extra 47,500 new cases of NPAFP. Clinically indistinguishable from polio paralysis but twice as deadly, the incidence of NPAFP was directly proportional to doses of oral polio received. Though this data was collected within the polio surveillance system, it was not investigated. The principle of primum-non-nocere [First, do no harm] was violated.”</p>

<p>AND</p>

<p>Media is Not Giving the Whole Picture on the Oral Polio Vaccine Controversy</p>

<p>Barbara Loe Fisher, co-founder of the National Vaccine Information Center (NVIC), spoke with Voice of America (VOA) about the intensive polio vaccine campaigns in the developing world. Unfortunately, much of Barbara’s interview and insights were edited out of the video, as she explains below:</p>

<p>“I taped an interview with Voice of America on the subject of intensive polio vaccine campaigns in the developing world. I gave the reporter this Indian journal article6 and raised the issue of the reported increases in Acute Flaccid Paralysis among Indian children given monthly doses of OPV [oral polio vaccine]. l told him that developed countries like the US had replaced live virus polio vaccine (OPV) with inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) more than a decade ago to prevent cases of vaccine-strain polio because OPV, being a live virus vaccine, causes recently vaccinated children to shed vaccine-strain polio virus in their body fluids for a period of time following vaccination. In underdeveloped countries with poverty and poor sanitation (like open sewage), vaccine-strain viruses can contaminate water and facilitate transmission of vaccine-strain paralytic polio.</p>

<p>I brought up the issue of poverty, including poor sanitation, malnutrition, and limited access to health care facilities (for example, to undergo re-hydradation from diarrhea) as being an important cause of disease and poor health separate from vaccination.</p>

<p>I did question whether repeated mass vaccination campaigns in underdeveloped countries were more a function of pharmaceutical companies seeking to sell product rather than making investments in infrastructure that address the basic causes of poor health. And I also questioned the lack of safety science to demonstrate that it is safe to give children MONTHLY polio vaccinations when children in the developed world only receive 5 doses.</p>

<p>As you know, NVIC does not oppose the use of polio vaccine but we do not support excessive, repeated OPV vaccination campaigns in impoverished populations when that approach is not backed up with good safety science.</p>

<p>We do oppose use of government enforcement mechanisms to aggressively implement mass vaccination campaigns that fail to obtain the voluntary, informed consent of the parents of children being vaccinated. We do this because NVIC defends the ethical principal of informed consent to medical risk taking, which is a human right, and we defend that right without compromise.</p>

<p>It is too bad that the VOA report did not address poverty,  malnutrition and the root causes of disease versus simply giving these children OPV vaccine over and over again, when the vaccine can cause vaccine-strain polio, there are no safety studies showing that it is safe to give children monthly doses of OPV and the report out of India indicates that increases in Acute Flaccid Paralysis may be associated with repeated OPV vaccination in children.”</p>

<p><a href="https://realfarmacy.com/confirmed-indias-polio-eradication-campaign-caused-47500-cases-of-vaccine-induced-polio-paralysis/">https://realfarmacy.com/confirmed-indias-polio-eradication-campaign-caused-47500-cases-of-vaccine-induced-polio-paralysis/</a></p>

<p>In caae you don&#39;t know, polio is defeated by proper sanitation/nutrition. India has poor sanitation/nutrition and the vaccine is causing vaccine-induced polio.</p>

<p>&quot;On June 17, 2016, the International Business Times (IBT) reported that a strain of the vaccine-derived polio virus has been discovered in Hyderabad, India, and experts have warned that the likelihood of more cases being discovered over the next year is extremely likely.</p>

<p>Reporters stated that:</p>

<p>Experts also said that India’s current immunisation programme, which involves the use of Oral Polio vaccine (OPV), may also pose the risk of the spread of the disease.</p>

<p>They continued:</p>

<p>OPV has a weak or attentuated virus that triggers immune response in children to fight against polio. However, in rare cases when a child excretes the virus, it may multiply in sewage, and undergo mutations which lead to transmission of the disease.</p>

<p>Further, the IBT stated:</p>

<p>However, children who were earlier immunised with the trivalent vaccine (which had P1, P2 and P3 strains) may continue excreting P2 strains for at least sometime. There is also a perceived threat that children who have been immunised now may be prone to infection since they did not get P2 strain of vaccine, according to scroll.in.&quot;</p>

<p>AND</p>

<p>&quot;Activist and physician Anant Phadke and C Sathyamala, epidemiologist who has been working on community health projects in different parts of the country for over 20 years, argued that it is not possible to eradicate polio, a disease primarily of poor sanitation and nutrition, with a vaccine. Polio-like paralysis can also be caused by other factors. DDT and other pesticides, exposure to lead and arsenic, other neurotoxins, injections, and vaccinations can trigger paralysis. Thus a holistic approach was needed to tackle the disease.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Edit. Responses below this have been edited to significantly change their content. I just noticed this. Just scanning over it it seems like there&#39;s a bunch of stuff from before 1989 when the 2 shot immunization protocol was introduced. No shit, those outbreaks caused concerns about the effectiveness of the one shot, so now people get two and have since the early 90s. This guy repeatedly makes the claim that the cdc/gubernment says the vaccine is 100% effective-they don&#39;t. Its effective at around97%. He also repeatedly claims that outbreaks happen in highly vaccinated populations. Google that shit yourself. 80-90% of cases in those widespread outbreaks happen in people without vaccinations. Fully vaccinated, 1 in 30 people will get measles if exposed, and the numbers reflect that reality. Additionally, pre vaccine around 450k cases of measles per year in the us were reported annually, and 6000 deaths. Thats the true cost of not vaccinating. 6000 preventable deaths per year in the us alone. No, im not going to provide a link. It&#39;s called google. That way, you can see it&#39;s not a single credible source, but dozens.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just in case you need more references for vaccinated outbreaks and the ineffectiveness of the MMR vaccine:</p>

<p>&quot;Get the measles vaccine, and you won’t get the measles—or give it to anyone else. Right? Well, not always. A person fully vaccinated against measles has contracted the disease and passed it on to others. The startling case study contradicts received wisdom about the vaccine and suggests that a recent swell of measles outbreaks in developed nations could mean more illnesses even among the vaccinated.</p>

<p>When it comes to the measles vaccine, two shots are better than one. Most people in the United States are initially vaccinated against the virus shortly after their first birthday and return for a booster shot as a toddler. Less than 1% of people who get both shots will contract the potentially lethal skin and respiratory infection. And even if a fully vaccinated person does become infected—a rare situation known as “vaccine failure”—they weren’t thought to be contagious.</p>

<p>That’s why a fully vaccinated 22-year-old theater employee in New York City who developed the measles in 2011 was released without hospitalization or quarantine. But like Typhoid Mary, this patient turned out to be unwittingly contagious. Ultimately, she transmitted the measles to four other people, according to a recent report in Clinical Infectious Diseases that tracked symptoms in the 88 people with whom “Measles Mary” interacted while she was sick. Surprisingly, two of the secondary patients had been fully vaccinated. And although the other two had no record of receiving the vaccine, they both showed signs of previous measles exposure that should have conferred immunity.&quot;</p>

<p>Recently Vaccinated Individuals Can Spread Disease</p>

<p>Barbara Loe Fisher is the co-founder and president of the National Vaccine Information Center (NVIC), a non-profit charity dedicated to preventing vaccine injuries and deaths through public education and defending the legal right for everyone to make vaccine choices.</p>

<p>She explains how you can shed live virus in body fluids whether you have a viral infection or have gotten a live attenuated viral vaccine:</p>

<p>&quot;Live attenuated viral vaccines (LAV) that use live viruses try to, in essence, fool your immune system into believing that you&#39;ve come into contact with a real virus, thereby stimulating the antibody response that, theoretically, will protect you,&quot; she says.</p>

<p>&quot;When you get these live viral vaccines, you shed live virus in your body fluids. Just like when you get a viral infection, you shed live virus. That&#39;s how viral infections are transmitted.</p>

<p>Because viruses, unlike bacteria, need a living host... in order to multiply. What these viruses do is they try to disable the immune system and evade immune responses.&quot;</p>

<p>It is possible to come down with measles after receiving an MMR vaccine. In 2013, for instance, a 2-year-old fell ill with vaccine-related measles 37 days after receiving the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine.</p>

<p>This was well beyond the typical incubation period for measles transmission, and it occurred in the context of an outbreak investigation of measles cluster. So at first it was assumed to be a wild-type measles infection, when in fact it was vaccine-related. We have no statistics about how often this assumption is made when it may actually be inaccurate.</p>

<p>As reported in Eurosurveillance:3</p>

<p>&quot;The incubation period of measles is typically eight to 12 days from exposure to rash onset, with a range from seven to 21 days. Public health interventions are based on this established incubation period for determining the epidemiological links between cases and for estimating periods of exclusion for contacts in high risk settings.</p>

<p>Based on our review of the literature, this report documents the first case of MMR vaccine-associated measles, 37 days post-immunization, well beyond 21 days and the routine 30 days post-MMR immunization period used by the Canadian adverse event following immunization (AEFI) surveillance system.</p>

<p>…Although this is the first such reported case, it likely represents the existence of additional, but unidentified, exceptions to the typical timeframe for measles vaccine virus shedding and illness.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2015/03/24/amp/recently-vaccinated-individuals-spread-disease.aspx">https://www.google.com/amp/s/articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2015/03/24/amp/recently-vaccinated-individuals-spread-disease.aspx</a></p>

<p>&quot;Scientific evidence demonstrates that individuals vaccinated with live virus vaccines such as MMR (measles, mumps and rubella), rotavirus, chicken pox, shingles and influenza can shed the virus for many weeks or months afterwards and infect the vaccinated and unvaccinated alike.1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10</p>

<p>Furthermore, vaccine recipients can carry diseases in the back of their throat and infect others while displaying no symptoms of a disease.11,12,13</p>

<p>“Numerous scientific studies indicate that children who receive a live virus vaccination can shed the disease and infect others for weeks or even months afterwards. Thus, parents who vaccinate their children can indeed put others at risk,” explains Leslie Manookian, documentary filmmaker and activist. Manookian’s award winning documentary, The Greater Good, aims to open a dialog about vaccine safety.</p>

<p>Both unvaccinated and vaccinated individuals are at risk from exposure to those recently vaccinated. Vaccine failure is widespread; vaccine-induced immunity is not permanent and recent outbreaks of diseases such as whooping cough, mumps and measles have occurred in fully vaccinated populations.14,15 Flu vaccine recipients become more susceptible to future infection after repeated vaccination.16,17&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.westonaprice.org/studies-show-that-vaccinated-individuals-spread-disease/">https://www.westonaprice.org/studies-show-that-vaccinated-individuals-spread-disease/</a></p>

<p>As for highly vaccinated populations still getting outbreaks:</p>

<p>&quot;An outbreak of measles occurred in a high school with a documented vaccination level of 98 per cent. Nineteen (70 per cent) of the cases were students who had histories of measles vaccination at 12 months of age or older and are therefore considered vaccine failures. Persons who were unimmunized or immunized at less than 12 months of age had substantially higher attack rates compared to those immunized on or after 12 months of age. Vaccine failures among apparently adequately vaccinated individuals were sources of infection for at least 48 per cent of the cases in the outbreak. There was no evidence to suggest that waning immunity was a contributing factor among the vaccine failures. Close contact with cases of measles in the high school, source or provider of vaccine, sharing common activities or classes with cases, and verification of the vaccination history were not significant risk factors in the outbreak. The outbreak subsided spontaneously after four generations of illness in the school and demonstrates that when measles is introduced in a highly vaccinated population, vaccine failures may play some role in transmission but that such transmission is not usually sustained.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1646939/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1646939/</a></p>

<p>Again I ask, what is the benefit of getting an admittedly ineffective and potentially harmful vaccine that gives extremely limited immunity (which doesn&#39;t protect the person recieving the vaccine and can easily infect others even if they are vaccinated) when getting the disease naturally provides LIFETIME immunity?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One of flaw of vaccines is that the antibodies induced don’t last a lifetime, some types of vaccine work better than others.  The mumps part of the MMR was faked from the start as admitted by the researchers involved, they added animal antibodies into the test results to make the vaccine appear a success.</p>

<p>So the mumps part of the vaccine hasn’t worked well from the start, when it does work it lasts a couple of years, yet it was anti-vaxxers being blamed for Mumps outbreaks, when all along is was vaccine failure and fraudulent science at the root of this.  </p>

<p>All along the lies have been from CDC and Merck, who now want to use their vaccine failure as an excuse to sell more vaccines.</p>

<p>a booster injection or booster dose is a re-exposure to the immunizing antigen. It is intended to increase immunity against that antigen <strong>back to protective levels</strong></p>

<p>Do you understand what that highlighted phrase means?</p>

<p>Why would you need a booster to increase immunity <em>back</em> to protective levels if it had not fallen <em>below</em> protective levels?</p>

<p>If the level of immunity is not protective, does that not mean the vaccine has failed to confer lifetime immunity?</p>

<p>Well, yes! That&#39;s exactly what it means. Unlike natural immunity, fake immunity is temporary, at least in the case of mumps.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Whats interesting is that a person, in good health and in the u.s., is statistically more likely to be injured from a vaccine than to be injured from the disease they&#39;re being vaccinated for. There&#39;s hundreds more vax injury court cases for each shot every year than reported injuries from lack of a shot. So when it comes time to decide to vaccinate a child it&#39;s a tough decision. I don&#39;t think lightly of rolling the dice, especially since it doesn&#39;t appear anyone is being injured from not taking the shots (who is healthy in the U.S.- of course they are necessary in many other situations). Are they? Where is the data?</p>

<p>I cannot find any data on children who are injured every year from not taking vaccines. I expected it to be easier to find. I can uncover the number of court cases won for vaccine injury per year per shot but I can&#39;t track down how many are injured from not being vaccinated. Although not majorly relevant, I know plenty of unvaxed kids with no problems and plenty of vaxed kids who have all kinds of impairments so I dont get why people who don&#39;t vax are met with such hate. Especially considering the increasing vaccine schedules.</p>

<p>Q: I got the vaccine but still got mumps. Does this mean the vaccine doesn’t work?</p>

<p>A: MMR vaccine prevents most, but not all, cases of mumps and complications caused by the disease. People who have received two doses of the MMR vaccine are about nine times less likely to get mumps than unvaccinated people who have the same exposure to mumps virus. However, some people who receive two doses of MMR can still get mumps, especially if they have prolonged, close contact with someone who has the disease. If a vaccinated person does get mumps, they will likely have less severe illness than an unvaccinated person.</p>

<p>Before there was a vaccine, mumps was a common childhood disease in the United States. In some cases, the disease caused complications, such as permanent deafness in children and, occasionally, swelling of the brain (encephalitis), which in rare cases resulted in death. From year to year, the number of mumps cases can range from roughly a couple hundred to a couple thousand. In some years, there are more cases of mumps than usual because of outbreaks. See Mumps Cases and Outbreaks  for more information.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mumps is so mild that most wouldn’t know they had it, it was origianlly seen as a silly idea to vaccinate against such a mild illness, as the vaccine would likely be more risk, so that is why Merck combined it with another vaccine which some people would want.</p>

<p>Big problem is that Mumps is mild when we catch it in childhood as nature intended, whereas now a young male will get a Mumps vaccine, be immune for a few years maximum, then be more likely to go down with Mumps as an adult, when a male gets Mumps as an adult it can make them infertile.  So this short term immunity is a dangerous game and all because the researchers involved faked the efficacy tests of the vaccine using animal antibodies.   Now you would need an MMR booster every 2 years, which increases the risk you will be harmed by a vaccine, whereas back in the day you could have been done with Mumps in a week as a child, probably wouldn’t know you had it, then be immune for life.  The situation is now and mess and should have been left alone.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>We believe it is plausible that vaccination against mumps can lead to a shift toward milder forms of the disease in a similar way as has been observed with varicella vaccine (27). Natural mumps in unvaccinated persons is known to be manifested as a minimally symptomatic infection with viral shedding (28). Studies have also reported a high proportion of asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic infections among vaccinated persons; more than half of case-patients did not have classical parotitis (12). The possibility of reduced severity of infections in vaccinated case-patients is also supported by findings of a lower virus isolation rate and shorter duration of viral detection in studies that compare vaccinated to unvaccinated patients (29,30). The lower rates of complications in vaccinated teenagers and young adults are consistent with secondary vaccine failure, which suggests that the primed person is able to mount an immune response to prevent more serious complications. A large number of cases with secondary vaccine failure is also consistent with declining protection with time since vaccination (7,31).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ignoring everything but what you want to see?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As reports of mumps outbreaks in highly immunized populations of older teenagers and young adults continue to occur, the long-term effects of mumps complications may be substantial. Our analysis, however, suggests that vaccination provides higher levels of protection against hospitalization and risk for orchitis and meningitis in those diagnosed with mumps. The effect of vaccination on mumps complications will therefore be increasingly critical in assessing the outcome of current and future mumps control strategies.</p>

<p>Seriously though, your reply was thought-provoking, and sounds like some depopulation evil super villain shit.  </p>

<p>By 1995, along with a global MMR vaccine shortage, people largely stopped taking the vaccine due to reports of links to autism, inflammatory bowel disease and Crohn&#39;s disease, with uptake dropping as low as 50th percentile in heavily populated l areas.</p>

<p>They sell a cure for an illness, that has a side effect of making people have difficulty communicating, forming relationships, or interpreting abstract concepts.  Anyone who doesn&#39;t take their medicine, is conveniently at much higher risk of infertility.  So our choice is infertility or ignorance.  </p>
