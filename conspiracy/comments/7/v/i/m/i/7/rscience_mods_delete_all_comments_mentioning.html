<p>These people don&#39;t want to hear about Graham Hancock because he isn&#39;t using their method of inquiry, and therefore is a lesser being than they. He could not possibly uncover truths that they don&#39;t accept as doctrine. </p>

<p>I mentioned 911 being an easily provable conspiracy and you lost your shit...</p>

<p>Dude, I snoopsnoo&#39;d your username and found your <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7ox3du/the_postweinstein_golden_globes_was_an_exercise/dsd44nf/">best comment</a>. It was literally you saying pizzagate is real and politicians are corrupt +/yada yada, and better yet it was in a post about hypocrisy. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I actually agree 100% with that comment which is why I&#39;m so surprised at what you&#39;re saying. Honestly it actually sounds like that thing where old accounts were being bought up and used to discredit conspiracies or for advertising or whatever. Seriously what is going on here...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Firstly, your response is half the reason this sub is in such a poor state at the moment, in my humble opinion. I mention my opinion and you go on a rant accusing me of being a sold account or shill or whatever. Why are you so combative? </p>

<p>It&#39;s just my opinion, just like every comment here is just a person&#39;s opinion.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll accept that rereading what I wrote, I wasn&#39;t clear: 
What I meant was proven or unproven conspiracy.</p>

<p>rather what I meant was if something is proven, it&#39;s not an unproven conspiracy... as such. I know that&#39;s poorly written: what I&#39;m saying is if we had a smoking gun that 9/11 was a government/CIA orchestrated event, it would be as you put it &quot;something that is true&quot;. Out would be a conspiracy proven to be true</p>

<p>However, while doubt remains, &quot;it&#39;s not easily provable&quot; : then it&#39;s an unproven conspiracy.</p>

<p>My example: 2 criminals decide to embezzle. They leave no proven trace of evidence= a conspiracy. Potentially even named &quot;conspiracy to commit...&quot;
They leave evidence which can prove their guilt= not a conspiracy, a crime. </p>

<p>Personally, I 110% believe 9/11 was orchestrated by elements of the US government. But it&#39;s not been proven thus far. Hence it is an unproven conspiracy. A true conspiracy is the context of conspiracy theories, in the corrupted context the term has taken thanks to their CIA or whoever. I&#39;m into unproven conspiracies, they&#39;re more fun.</p>

<p>Also, I didn&#39;t search your user history, because I literally don&#39;t care. I take what every account says on face value and in context to the thread/conversation. In my opinion, it&#39;s a huge pat on the back from you to me, that i have differing opinions regarding differing topics. That&#39;s a huge problem with &quot;society today&quot; (digital society), people thinking they&#39;re all one side or the other. So, thank you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just curious how much proof you need for a conspiracy to  to be proven? People accept have assed MSM news and science with a tenth of the proof 9/11 has. It&#39;s long since cross the boundary from conspiracy to conspirafact.  </p>

<p>Big issue here is conspiracy theories , even when well developed. Are almost never taken seriously by the authorities(usually because authorities are part and parcel of conspiracy theories) , pizza gate was a month in and not one law enforcement agency even glanced at it.</p>

<p>I think we are hitting a point sadly where personal truth barometers are all people have to go by. There certainly isn&#39;t a trusted authority remaining (name one not embroiled in some type of controversy)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you answered the question yourself.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t matter how much evidence I need, it will still remain an unproven conspiracy.</p>

<p>Terms like &#39;conspriafact&#39; are just as demeaning to the truth seeking cause as the twisted meanings of the term conspiracy theory.</p>

<p>9/11 is a perfect example where I&#39;d assume 90% of this sub and around 50% of the population at large think that there was some level of government involvement, however until the &#39;silver-bullet&#39; piece of evidence comes to light, it&#39;s an unproven conspiracy.</p>

<p>It sucks, but that&#39;s the world we live in. To believe I or anyone else, KNOWS the truth (besides the perpetrators of a particular conspiracy), is confirmation bias and a dangerous path in my opinion. Truth seeking means even questioning your own beliefs. Ask any religious person how difficult it is to truly question their own beliefs. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>But what if the silver bullet that proves beyond doubt, is never acted upon? That&#39;s where we are at with many conspiracies today. When the people who are CONSPIRING are in control,  shouldn&#39;t you question why these lingering questions never get answered? Like you say , half or more of the American citizens have alternate beliefs about the events of 911.. the commission reports, engineering reports etc, all counter MSM storyline.  Yet... court cases are blocked, war crimes tribunals are not set up. Noone has ever answered for any of the NSA or CIA bullshit... actually</p>

<p>While I&#39;m thinking of CIA, have you not ever viewed their FOIA room? They literally confirm dozens upon dozens of conspiracies in there. They released like 16 millllion documents in 2016/2017 . Conspirafact isn&#39;t a buzzword, it&#39;s a name for theories that  are beyond doubt... consider the recent recognition of Canadian mk ultra victims as a example, but feel free to look at the court proceedings yourself. Conspiracies happen everyday...</p>

<p>U: You can&#39;t recognized the biggest conspiracy to ever exist?</p>

<p>Kit8642: what&#39;s your thoughts on Bilderberg?</p>

<p>U: It&#39;s just a meeting of people, what&#39;s the big deal?</p>

<p>Kit8642: What&#39;s your opinion of Syria?</p>

<p>U: What? Are you an Assad supporter?</p>

<p>Kit8642: What do you think of 9/11?</p>

<p>U: Osama Bin Laden got what he diserved.</p>

<p>Kit8642: What makes you think OBL was at that compound?</p>

<p>U: Because That&#39;s what the media reported!</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>But even the idea that have been vetted can still be wrong.  To me, the general idea behind science should be disapproving ideas.  But the way It&#39;s used now is to standardized belief.  For instance, a couple years ago it was revealed that most pharama tester were only on males (because their hormones were more stable).  That alone should make anyone question the medical/science standard, especially if You&#39;re a female.  Just saying, when someone presents an idea as fully vetted and basically the bible of science, I scoff at it, because I persoanlly think someone could find why they are wrong in a couple years.  </p>

<p>I went to the U of A where a lot of the theories about the mass extinction were being researched.  The black mat is all over Arizona, as was Clovis culture: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2373324/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2373324/</a></p>

<p>And who mocks Graham Hancock?  I don&#39;t understand why this has to do with GH at all just because he liked the idea.  I never even knew he supported the ET impact theory (and that&#39;s after reading a lot on it) until this sub exploded about him today. </p>

<p>Oh look! He criticizes Hancock for his claims about lost civilizations. </p>

<p>He dos mention the Younger Dryas Impact Hypothesis and correctly points out that the matter was not scientifically concluded yet (even though he obviously was not a supoprter of the hypothesis at that point&quot;.</p>

<p>In his own words: &quot;...the reason the YDIH extraordinary claim has yet to find consensus is that extraordinary evidence has yet to emerge to support it. To be clear, the debate is not over lost civilizations.&quot; </p>

<p>So, Hancock piggybacked his unproven and pseudoscientific idea about a lost civilization on the Younger Dryas Impact Hypothesis after for decades claiming that the civilization got lost because of catastrophic pole shifts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From your own link. It was not an accepted hypothesis whatsoever. 
Other research has shown no support for the impact hypothesis. One group examined carbon-14 dates for charcoal particles that showed wildfires occurred well after the proposed impact date, and the glass-like carbon was produced by wildfires and no lonsdaleite was found.[47] Analysis of fluvial sediments on Santa Rosa Island by another group also found no evidence of lonsdaleite, impact-induced fires, or extraterrestrial impact.[28]</p>

<p>Research published in 2012 has shown that the so-called &quot;black mats&quot; are easily explained by typical earth processes in wetland environments.[6] The study of black mats, that are common in prehistorical wetland deposits which represent shallow marshlands, that were from 6000 to 40,000 years ago in the southwestern USA and Atacama Desert in Chile, showed elevated concentrations of iridium and magnetic sediments, magnetic spherules and titanomagnetite grains. It was suggested that because these markers are found within or at the base of black mats, irrespective of age or location, suggests that these markers arise from processes common to wetland systems, and probably not as a result of catastrophic bolide impacts.[</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, that was 10 years ago.  The big to-do at the time was they didn&#39;t like Firestone&#39;s evidence of the ET event, and there were a lot of papers against his use of nano-diamonds and microspherules in the black mat to prove it: <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/104/41/16016.short">http://www.pnas.org/content/104/41/16016.short</a></p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen Vance Haynes give a bunch of talks on the subject.  The problem wasn&#39;t that they were so opposed to a possible ET event for the YD.  As Haynes put it - &quot;we all know SOMETHING happened&quot;.  He thought that Firestone&#39;s data wasn&#39;t enough to prove it.</p>

<p>I only am showing you this to show that there have been a lot of researchers working on this for decades.  Haynes was the first one to find the black mats and that was in the 60s with the Murray Springs kill site: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Springs_Clovis_Site">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Springs_Clovis_Site</a></p>

But that wouldn&#39;t pass peer-review.  You need cold hard facts, not just circumstantial evidence.

2 - he hasn&#39;t supported this theory for two decades.  He used to think it was a pole shift, not an ET event.  That is not consistent.
3 - the article I posted was to show that this debate has been going on a long time, without Graham Hancock.  If you read the article, they aren&#39;t debunking the ET impact theory, they are debunking Firestone claiming he proved it with his analysis of the black mat. </p>

<p>&quot;Suppose that we had calculated, on the basis of sound evidence and beyond any shadow of a doubt, that our civilization was soon to be obliterated by a titanic geological cataclysm – a 30° displacement of the earth’s crust, for example, or a head-on collision with a ten-mile-wide nickel-iron asteroid travelling towards us at cosmic speed.&quot;</p>

You started your points by throwing shade on the very person responsible for introducing alternative theories on these mysteries to large segments of the population. I understand, and agree with, the need to give credit to whom it is due. Graham Hancock is a writer, journalist, and popularizer in the same sense that Carl Sagan was. Though he often spoke of it, Sagan did not discover biological evolution or microwave background radiation, yet he spoke authoritatively on the subjects and produced plausible conclusions of his own. I will accept your point, however, that it would benefit him and others to mention who did the prior research that made their theories possible.

    <div class="md"><p>The whole point of this post is to say that Graham Hancock has been vindicated for his theories.  It&#39;s in the title.</p>

<p>For what I&#39;m talking about - for a very long time it&#39;s been known that the mammoths and other megafauna went extinct during a mini ice-age called the Younger Dryas (YD).  Since the 60s what archaeologists saw - especially in Arizona, where there is a lot of study of Clovis/mammoth hunting - was that the YD is a dark dense layer, what they call the &#39;black mat&#39; (the dark thin layer): <a href="http://www.scientificpsychic.com/etc/carolina-bays/black-mat.jpg">http://www.scientificpsychic.com/etc/carolina-bays/black-mat.jpg</a></p>

<p>Mammoths <em>never</em> occur after the black mat. So for decades people have been speculating about this. It is such a distinct geological time frame when mammoths go extinct, the early theories that megafaunal extincti on was only due to overhunting didn&#39;t make sense (if it were, you&#39;d expect variation in when extinction occurred).  There were tons of theories - disease, the climate change itself alone - as well as the possibility that a comet (or an extraterrestrial impact - ET) was the cause of the YD and megafaunal extinction.</p>

<p>Researchers have been looking for a smoking gun to link YD/megafaunal extinction to the ET theory.  Firestone was the first to publish: <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/104/41/16016">http://www.pnas.org/content/104/41/16016</a></p>

<p>But, a lot of archaeologists thought his evidence was crappy.  Not because they were adverse to the ET theory so much, as they didn&#39;t think he he actually proved it and his data wasn&#39;t reproducible.  The best evidence is so far is the finding of platinum in the black mat layer (or YD in general, it doesn&#39;t always look like a black mat): <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/srep44031">https://www.nature.com/articles/srep44031</a></p>

<p>This post is in reference to a more recent study that showed evidence of biomass burning in ice cores samples, further supporting ET impact.  </p>

<p>But anyway, this whole tale is just to show mainstream science wasn&#39;t trying to suppress these theories or anything - it was one of the main alternatives to overhunting.  And also, all of this has nothing to do with Hancock. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah, very good. That sheds a hell of a lot of light on everything. ET = extraterrestrial impact. YD = Younger Dryas. Thank you for explaining. Until recently, I had never really questioned the &quot;hunted into extinction&quot; theory. In fact, a few years back, I wrote a poem as part of a larger work about paleolithic hunters causing the extinction of mammoths. Recently revised to introduce it as &quot;mythological&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, overhunting has to have played a role.  Actually there are still some other things they don&#39;t have neat answers to - like the fact that a lot of megafauna were going extinct even before the YD.  So your poem is still valid ;)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He is dismissed as nonsense because none of his claims are testable.</p>

<p>As an example of something being testable:</p>

<p>A simple experiment on special relativity, something Tetryonics claims to disprove:</p>

<p>I fly a satellite around the earth at high velocity. It has a clock. By knowing the speed of the satellite as it orbits, and using the equations for time dilation given by special relativity, I can predict how many milliseconds the clock will be off. I can predict it will be off because special relativity predicts that time slows down the faster an object moves, and also provides an equation to calculate how much slower.</p>

<p>If you perform this experiment in real life, the results should match the prediction or special relativity is wrong.</p>

<p>I am a lay person who has no specialized knowledge of special relativity, yet even I can form a testable experiment to prove or disprove special relativity.</p>

<p>you know more about Tetryonics than me, so show me an experiment in the real world that has results that can only be explained with the principles of Tetryonics.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You misunderstand the entire thing and took the strawman position of it &quot;disproves general relativity&quot; it&#39;s like saying it disproves &quot;electricity&quot; and then go on to explain how electricity is measured in amps. It doesn&#39;t disprove time dilation, it explains it in a way that incorporates all the fundamental forces.  The misunderstanding comes from  the misapplication of lorrentz contraction to objects with Matter, where in reality this should only apply to mass and waves. You have to think that all Matter has waves (black body radiation) surrounding it (think of a boat with wakes, like this   <a href="https://youtu.be/WIyTZDHuarQ">https://youtu.be/WIyTZDHuarQ</a>), currently we apply the contraction to the whole thing, boat included. 
It doesn&#39;t disprove  any observed experiments at all, it explains things like dark matter and dark energy which current theories are unable to, it also explains gravity on a quantum level, which current theories are unable to, and quantum entanglement in a much more intuitive manner.
The inherent misunderstanding comes from the belief Tetryonics &quot;disproves&quot; current experiments, it doesn&#39;t. And yes it predicts observable phenomena that can be found in data from CERN, just noone has looked for the specific signal. It predicts a whole host of observables as well, including observed phenomena like ball lightning.</p>

<p>In fact, that&#39;s sort of the issue in academia. Beyond just being a point of pride, this discovery invalidates <em>decades</em> of some of these people&#39;s careers. Because academics don&#39;t have the luxury of saying &quot;it&#39;s open to interpretation&quot; like the religious do, it&#39;s just easier for them to pretend the inconvenient information doesn&#39;t exist than it is to accept it and throw away everything they&#39;ve worked on in the past.

    <div class="md"><p>30 years ago Graham Hancock wrote a great book Finger Prints of the Gods where he examined ancient megalithic sites and stories and revealed that many of them are way too sophisticated to be built by the supposed levels civilization had achieved yet.</p>

<p>He supposed that civilization did not progress in a linear fashion, but that our progress had risen quite far and was somehow &quot;reset&quot; back to almost stone age levels some 13,000 years ago.</p>

<p>Many megalithic site have that date of 13,000 years ago encoded into them.</p>

<p>&quot;We are a species with amnesia.&quot; </p>

<p>He was harshly ridiculed for decades with critics main argument being that there is no evidence that megalithic construction that old and no evidence for the cataclysm that reset humanity.</p>

<p>Then not long back Gobekli Tepe was discovered to be a megalithic site 13,000 years old.</p>

<p>And now the second part, the cataclysm, has been confirmed.</p>

<p>Academia does not seem to want to consider that humanity&#39;s progression might not be linear. That we were once perhaps as sophisticated as we are today, but fell. </p>

<p>And just maybe, the are entire chapters of advanced civilizations lost to us.</p>

His first book on any sort of non-mainstream thought (afaik) was The Sign and the Seal, which although wildly speculative, discusses evidence suggesting the removal the ark of the covenant from Jerusalem to its eventual, and (at the time it was written) current place of rest in a church in the Ethiopian capital Axum.</p>

<p>As well as tracking the timeline and route the ark is believed to have taken, he goes into some detailed analysis of the stories of the ark, and the properties and fats attributed to it when Moses coming down from the mountain literally glowing and reddened and its use as a weapon making it sound like whatever was in it was at the very least HIGHLY radioactive and maybe some kind of &#39;death ray&#39; akin to how it&#39;s portrayed at the me of raiders of the lost ark.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Everyone does seem to still be bringing up some of his relevant points like Gobekli Tepe but it&#39;s horrifying they&#39;re actively trying to keep Hancock away from modern &quot;Science&quot;. To me it&#39;s undoubtedly his views on reality and use of psychedelics (in addition to his archaeological beliefs) that have made him a target, he&#39;s a kook to any self respecting materialist reductionist who listens to Sam Harris so his personality lands him in the trash folder. This isn&#39;t just reddit though, lets not forget the famous TED disaster he had with Rupert Sheldrake.</p>

<p>On the topic the degradation of Inca architecture from insane CNC level accuracy like <a href="https://hiddenincatours.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/DSCF7971e.jpg">this</a> and megalithic stones with highly irregular joints with paper width tolerances like <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2b/Cusco_Piedra_de_los_doce_angulos.jpg">this</a> to 150 something years later their repairs on a building looks like <a href="https://media.gettyimages.com/photos/ruins-of-cyclopean-walls-on-acropolis-of-tiryns-greece-mycenaean-picture-id588936017">this</a></p>

<p>Call me skeptical but what the fuck is that about? Were the Inca master sculptors and mathematicians for 100 years and then everyone just forgot how to smoosh rocks together like butter?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, that is exactly what happened. They lost those construction methods because the Spanish conquistadors killed all their leaders and destroyed all their records. It didn&#39;t help that the Inca empire was in the middle of a civil war when the Spanish came. The Spaniards were able to exploit these existing divisions to conquer the Inca extremely quickly.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>True! For a second I thought you were talking about the Aztecs because I&#39;m far more familiar with their fate but after a wiki visit you make a good point.  My only point I guess would be the narrow timeline in which things like Sacsayhuaman were built: Inhabited in the 9th century, first structures built 11th century and all of the real peculiar features in the 13th by the Inca <a href="https://www.peru.travel/Portals/_default/Images/News/sacsayhuaman_valle_sagrado_03_max.jpg">(namely the transition to <strong>massive</strong> blocks with skew geometric joints)</a>.</p>

<p>While less than a century before:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Inca people began as a tribe in the Cusco area around the 12th century AD. Under the leadership of Manco Cápac they formed the small city-state of Cusco Quechua Qosqo.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It just seems silly (to me) that tribal folk who may have had advanced knowledge of medicinal herbs and astrology could start building structures like that within one hundred years of forming (and only 200 years before their collapse). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I want to upvote you for mentioning that the sphinx has been reshaped (from Anubis the dog, as it points at Sirius &quot;the dog star&quot; during the equinox), but I disagree with calling Graham a gatekeeper. He comes off as a very honest person who&#39;s simply come to his conclusions based on the evidence he&#39;s seen, as most people do. Have you got any links to where he talks about the Sphinx before it was reshaped though? Because I haven&#39;t heard much from him on that apart from something I heard a while ago in passing, so I know I could do with a mental refresher anyway. </p>
