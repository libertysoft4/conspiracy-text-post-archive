<p><a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/evgeny-buryakov-pleads-guilty-manhattan-federal-court-connection-conspiracy-work">SVR Ring Press Release</a></p>

<p>Here’s the actual Criminal Complaint detailing Male-1</p>

<p><a href="https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/opa/press-releases/attachments/2015/01/26/buryakov-complaint.pdf">SVR Ring Criminal Complaint</a></p>

<p>From the press release:  “In response to requests from Sporyshev, UCE-1 provided Sporyshev with binders containing purported industry analysis written by UCE-1 and supporting documentation relating to UCE-1’s reports, as well as covertly placed recording devices.  Sporyshev then took the binders to, among other places, the Residentura.”</p>

<p>From the Criminal Complaint:  “On or about June 13, 2013, Agent-2 and I interviewed Male-1. Male-1 stated that he first met VICTOR PODOBNYY, the defendant, inJanuary 2013 at an energy symposium in New York City. During this initial meeting, PODOBNYY gave Male-1 PODOBNYY&#39;s business card and two email addresses. Over the following months, Male-1 and PODOBNYY exchanged emails about the energy business and met in person on occasion, with Male-1 providing PODOBNYY with Male-1&#39;s outlook on the current and future of the energy industry. Male-1 also provided documents to PODOBNYY about the energy business.”</p>

<p>Male-1 only interacted with Podobnyy while UCE-1 exchanged bugged materials with Sporoshev.  Furthermore, in the disclosed telephone communication between Podobnyy and Sporoshev regarding Male-1, it is clear that Sporoshev had no pre-existing knowledge of Male-1, rather Podobnyy is informing that he’s targeted him to try and collect information.</p>

<p>Carter Page admitted to being Male-1 in Congressional testimony, but his other descriptions of his interactions in relation to the case (in sworn testimony) do not indicate that he was ever more involved than that, rather the opposite is true, that he was merely a peripheral witness.</p>

<p>Here’s Carter Page’s testimony for those interested:</p>

<p><a href="https://intelligence.house.gov/uploadedfiles/carter_page_hpsci_hearing_transcript_nov_2_2017.pdf">Carter Page Congressional Testimony</a></p>

<p>While I still believe it is more likely than not that Carter Page has had his personal life and reputation completely destroyed under false pretenses, people need to stop pushing the Carter Page was an undercover agent theory. The information in this post firmly negates that theory.</p>

<p>This was a high profile counter intelligence case, there is an extremely low probability that UCE-1’s or Male-1’s interactions with Podobnyy and Sporoshev were incorrectly disclosed in either the Criminal Complaint or the associated press release.</p>

<p>Just wanted to post this as we should all desire to be constructing theories and interpreting information based off of accurate disclosure of the pertinent facts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>SS: I was compiling a lengthy post outlining why UCE-1 could very well be Male-1, based solely on the press release and Criminal Complaint, but I came to the realization that it is extremely unlikely due to the fact that UCE-1 exchanged materials with Sporoshev while Male-1 exchanged materials with Podobnyy. Disclosed captured phone call transcripts in the Criminal Complaint and Carter Page’s sworn congressional testimony serve to confirm this information.</p>

<p>It was a fun theory but Male-1 (Carter Page) is almost certainly not UCE-1 (undercover FBI employee.</p>

<p>Sure, but Carter Page is really his own worst enemy. I agree his life is much worse off now than it was before 2016. He probably lived a decent life as an energy consultant.</p>

<p>The guy does not hire a lawyer for his testimony and probably didn&#39;t fire a lawyer for any of his interviews with Mueller. He goes on TV all the time spouting nonsense talking points about Radio Free Liberty and the Clinton campaign attacking him because he is Catholic. Even this week, Fox News hosts were having a tough time keeping Page on topic about the Memo because he just strays off constantly to attack &quot;The West&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ive read through his whole testimony and honestly, I think he’s clean.</p>

<p>I agree he’s his own worst enemy and going on that trip is something he regrets, but there’s no way in hell he could’ve predicted even a fraction of the shitstorm that would follow.</p>

<p>If you read his testimony it’s pretty clear that partly why some of his answers come off as so weird and “hedgy” is because he’s well aware he’s been under heavy surveillance and he’s terrified that he’ll be entrapped by not providing a document via subpoena or an answer to something that doesn’t exactly add up and he’ll be accused of lying.</p>

<p>He basically stated he didn’t turn over documents related to the subpoena because he knows that whatever he turns over cannot possibly be as comprehensive as what has already been collected on him via surveillance. He doesn’t trust the government and right now, I don’t see how anyone could blame him.</p>

<p>He’s also right, there’s no way what he turns over could be as comprehensive as what has been collected on him. Responding to subpoenas can be difficult even when you have the resources and mechanisms in place, I can vouch for that from work experience. Let alone one as comprehensive as I’m sure he got hit with.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don’t completely agree. Look, absent the Sporoshev-Podobnyy contradiction, it’d actually be a compelling theory. The descriptions match up and so actually do the timelines of Male-1’s involvement and the dates for which conversations were captured via the covert recording device. There’s also a “Male-2” that could be argued is “UCE-2” and then you’d have an instance where the nomenclature for a UCE was changed in the Criminal Complaint.</p>

<p>It doesn’t matter though because the contradiction kills the theory. I’m not going to blanket state every person who missed it is being a deliberate misinformer. There’s new info every day to digest, it’s easy to miss one specific detail.</p>

<p>Now if people become aware of the contradiction and continue to push the theory without disclosing the contradiction, then yes those people are being deliberate in their deception.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Please help me with my understanding sincerely.</p>

<p>Summary of pertinent knowns connecting Male-1 with UCE-1 with sources:<br/>
* Sporyshev was to collect documents from Male-1 according to Podobnyy (<a href="https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/opa/press-releases/attachments/2015/01/26/buryakov-complaint.pdf">Link - bottom page 12</a>)<br/>
* UCE-1 gave documents to Sporyshev (<a href="https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/opa/press-releases/attachments/2015/01/26/buryakov-complaint.pdf">Link - paragraph 9</a>)<br/>
* Male-1 is Carter Page who works for a New York energy firm [Global Energy Capital] (<a href="https://intelligence.house.gov/uploadedfiles/carter_page_hpsci_hearing_transcript_nov_2_2017.pdf">Link - page 16 paragraph 2</a>)<br/>
* UCE-1 was &quot;<em>posing as an analyst from a New York-based energy company</em>&quot; (<a href="https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/opa/press-releases/attachments/2015/01/26/buryakov-complaint.pdf">Link - paragraph 9</a>)</p>

<p>The conversation between Podobnyy and Sporyshev on page 12 shows Podobnyy telling Sporyshev, &quot;You get the documents from him [Male-1] and tell him to go fuck himself.&quot; We also know UCE-1 gave bugged documents to Sporyshev. Not to mention both Male-1 and UCE-1 worked for a New York energy company. We do not know when UCE-1 gave bugged documents to Sporyshev.</p>

<p>You state, &quot;his [Page] other descriptions of his interactions in relation to the case (in sworn testimony) do not indicate that he was ever more involved than that&quot;. Can you provide examples?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I was thinking along the same lines as you initially, but from the Criminal Complaint and press release we actually know the dates of disclosed recorded conversations that were captured via UCE-1’s bugged binders.</p>

<p>Top of page 6 Criminal Complaint: Discloses lawfully obtained audio recordings within a secure office “the SVR New York office”.</p>

<p>Each audio recorded conversation disclosed in the document is dated and referenced as taking place in “the SVR New York office”. The earliest such captured conversation is dated January 31, 2013.</p>

<p>From the press release: “During the course of the investigation, the FBI recorded Sporyshev and Podobnyy speaking inside the SVR’s offices in New York, known as the “Residentura.” </p>

<pre><code>        The FBI obtained the recordings after Sporyshev attempted to recruit an FBI undercover employee (“UCE-1”), who was posing as an analyst from a New York-based energy company.  In response to requests from Sporyshev, UCE-1 provided Sporyshev with binders containing purported industry analysis written by UCE-1 and supporting documentation relating to UCE-1’s reports, as well as covertly placed recording devices.  Sporyshev then took the binders to, among other places, the Residentura.”
</code></pre>

<p>The conversation between Podobnyy and Sporoshev regarding Sporoshev possibly meeting Male-1 occurred April 8, 2013.</p>

<p>So, the bugged binders had already been placed in the SVR New York offices three months before Sporoshev even became aware of Male-1.</p>

<p>On top of this, in Page’s congressional testimony he never makes any allusion to being more involved than as outlined as Male-1. He maintains pretty firmly that he was just a peripheral witness to attempted recruitment.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The conversation on April 8, 2013 indicates that Sporyshev was already aware of Male-1&#39;s existence. It cannot be concluded from this conversation that this is the first time Sporyshev was being told about Male-1.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It doesn’t conclusively state that Sporoshev was already aware, that’s fair, but also we’re really starting to reach here. Podobnyy says “I think he forgot who I am” “he writes me in Russian”. There is no reason to conclude that any of the spies had communicated with Male-1 outside of Podobnyy.</p>

<p>When  Sporoshev responds later “shit, then he will write me” it is indicative that he has limited experience with Male-1 even if he was aware of him prior. If he was familiar with Male-1 he wouldn’t be worried about a communication blunder from Podobnyy interacting with him.</p>

<p>Podobnyy also says “you get the documents from him and tell him to go fuck himself”... “you make empty promises”. </p>

<p>Now, I feel he is discussing more, hypothetically, how exploitation of intelligence sources could work, but even if they are referring to Male-1 specifically in regards to Sporoshev, it is indicative that no documents have yet been exchanged with Male-1 and Sporoshev. This is April 8, 2013. The FBI had already successfully placed a recording device as early as January 31, 2013.</p>

<p>For the theory to remain valid, you really have to twist everything a lot to get the theory to remain internally consistent.</p>

<p>Based on the facts we have to go off, I still remain confident it’s near certain Male-1 is not UCE-1.</p>

<p>At this point also don’t you think Page would’ve leaked that to someone given it would make the case he’s a Russian Spy even flimsier?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Page’s testimony is a 243 Page document and I don’t have a searchable copy, I read the whole thing though. Sorry, it’d just take too long to scroll through and type up quotes.</p>

<p>I’d quote it if I felt it was necessary to firmly negate UCE-1=Male-1, but the recording device being “placed” three months before Sporoshev even learns of Male-1 means Male-1 couldn’t have been the guy who placed the binders via Sporoshev.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;UCE-1 was first introduced to Sporyshev in Spring 2012&quot;</p>

<p>This is unsourced.  It appears NOWHERE in the gov documents, it ONLY appears as a claim by Reuters on Mar 9, 2016 and is then repeated ad nausea by rest of the MSM.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying Page IS UCE-1, but you have not disproved this hypothesis.   </p>
