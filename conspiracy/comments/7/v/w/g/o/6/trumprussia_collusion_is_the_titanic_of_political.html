        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The entire narrative keeping afloat the idea of &quot;Trump-Russia collusion&quot; is crumbling faster than ever before. I expect the usual downvotes that come from questioning the official story and giving you a different opinion on a conspiracy sub, but this post is for everyone, including the people who believe they can simply hide all information that makes them uncomfortable. You have enjoyed being on the offensive for the last year and a half, but now you are forced on to the defensive, forced to defend certain people and actions you would rather not, and you don&#39;t like it. I understand.</p>

<p>Christopher Steele, the foreign agent who created the now-infamous Piss Dossier allegedly based on Russian-sourced information, which was created <a href="https://apnews.com/63c883156e314b68b86209d3b63890f5">after</a> receiving funds from the DNC and Hillary Clinton, now faces accusations of perjury in the US, the UK, or both.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/2018-02-06%20CEG%20LG%20to%20DOJ%20FBI%20(Unclassified%20Steele%20Referral).pdf">https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/2018-02-06%20CEG%20LG%20to%20DOJ%20FBI%20(Unclassified%20Steele%20Referral).pdf</a></p>

<p>The unverified parts of the Piss Dossier that have not already been proven false are relying heavily on accusing Carter Page of being a key player in the collusion. Meanwhile, Carter Page is still to this day both a free man, not sent to prison by US prosecutors, not put in the witness protection program, and also not dead, somehow avoiding the ruthless Russians and their assassins, and he is happily doing television interviews with no lawyer to help him. Carter Page is <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/carter-page-trump-russia-investigation-zero-fears-mueller-indictment-a8029841.html">completely unconcerned</a> about being prosecuted for any crime, because he knows his entire life has already been combed through by this point, and in fact he is <a href="https://nypost.com/2017/09/14/ex-trump-aide-carter-page-sues-yahoo-huffpost-for-defamation/">taking legal action</a> himself as a result of accusations thrown his way. (Also interesting to note that Carter Page is suing Yahoo (among others) over the same article mentioned in Christopher Steele&#39;s criminal referral:
 <a href="https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/2018-02-06%20CEG%20LG%20to%20DOJ%20FBI%20(Unclassified%20Steele%20Referral).pdf">https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/2018-02-06%20CEG%20LG%20to%20DOJ%20FBI%20(Unclassified%20Steele%20Referral).pdf</a>)</p>

<p>This all comes after <a href="https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/02/03/carter-page-nunes-memo-216934">Carter Page assisted the FBI with their investigations in to a Russian spy ring in 2013</a>. Carter Page was not charged.</p>

<p>So, now, what we are left with is Christopher Steele and Carter Page.</p>

<p>Christopher Steele will most likely go down for perjury, making the DNC / Clinton-funded Piss Dossier worth even less than it is now. It will be put on about the same level as a Facebook rant from a convicted liar - a paid political hitman. A desperate collection of amusing stories created by a mercenary who wanted to keep the money train rolling in, and keep his network of influence within US agencies intact. Steele&#39;s conviction is not necessary though, as the burden of proof remains on him. Nobody must prove that the Piss Dossier is any more false than it has already been proven to be. Steele, or others on his behalf, must prove that the accusations are true. And because many of those accusations rely on Carter Page playing a key role, it is extremely doubtful that they are true. The doubt grows with every passing day that Carter Page remains a free man, and Trump remains president.</p>

<p>Carter Page will continue to be looked at as <a href="https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/02/03/carter-page-nunes-memo-216934">&quot;a bit of an idiot&quot;</a> by anyone who has read about him and his history. I actually find it hard to believe that any serious person believes Carter Page had a major role in this story. The Russians knew he was compromised since 2013 when Page told the FBI what he knew about a Russian spy ring, leading to convictions of Russian spies... but we&#39;re supposed to believe the Russians are going to trust this blithering idiot and FBI snitch with rigging the elections years later? This fool who can&#39;t keep his mouth shut and goes on TV interviews with no lawyer? And then we would have to believe that both Carter Page and his Russian associates managed to pull this off with no evidence coming to light in the years since.</p>

<p>How does this political hoax relate to the tragedy of the Titanic, you ask?</p>

<p>The Titanic did not have enough lifeboats to save everyone after it crashed and fell apart. Those who waited, or were forced to wait due to their low status, until the last minute to jump off the sinking ship did not survive. They froze to death or drowned - their hands paralyzed by the cold, no longer able to cling to the flimsy wreckage of the ship that once kept them safely afloat.</p>

<p>However, there is no lifeboat for the captain. The captain must take ultimate responsibility. The captain must go down with the ship.</p>

<p>Who will be designated as the honorary captain of this hoax before it finally sinks? Who does it all lead back to? Who is such damaged goods, such a burden to their country, party, political and business associates, both in the recent past, present, and future? Who has brought the most humiliation on a global scale, both personal and political, for all of the people involved in this hoax? Who is expendable and ready to be cut loose? Can you think of any names that would fit here? ;-)</p>

</blockquote>

<p>That article is very good. It doesn&#39;t say anything about Carter Page &quot;assisting&quot; the FBI though, how did you come to that conclusion? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>the real purpose of Page’s trip was clandestine. He had come to meet with the Kremlin. And in particular with Igor Sechin. Sechin was a former spy and, more importantly, someone who commanded Putin’s absolute confidence. He was in effect Russia’s second most powerful official, its de facto deputy leader.</p>

<p>By this point Sechin had been at Putin’s side for more than three decades. He had begun his career in the KGB and served as a military translator in Mozambique. In the 1990s he worked with Putin in the mayor’s offce in St Petersburg. Sechin functioned as Putin’s scowling gatekeeper. He carried the boss’s briefcase and lurked outside Putin’s ground-floor office in St Petersburg’s city hall.</p>

<p>His appearance was lugubrious. Sechin had a rubbery face, narrow-set eyes, and a boxer’s squishy nose. When Putin was elected president, Sechin became his deputy chief of staff and, from 2004, executive chairman of the Russian state oil firm Rosneft, the country’s biggest oil producer. A stint as deputy prime minister was not successful. “He’s clever, despite looking like a dummy. But he can’t speak or do public politics,” Sergei Sokolov, deputy editor of the liberal Novaya Gazeta newspaper, said of Sechin.</p>

<p>In private Sechin impressed. Chris Barter—the former CEO of Goldman Sachs Moscow—described him as an “extremely charming and smart guy, on top of his numbers operationally.” It was clear that Sechin had Russia’s entire security services at his disposal. He would be willing to personally reward anyone who advanced the objectives of the Russian state, Barter added.</p>

<p>In 2014 Page had written a sycophantic piece that lauded Sechin for his “great accomplishments.” In a blog for Global Policy, Page wrote that Sechin had done more to advance U..S.-Russian relations than anybody in decades. Sechin was a wronged Russian statesman, in Page’s view, unfairly punished and sanctioned by the Obama White House.</p>

<p>This was the backdrop to Page’s Moscow trip.</p>

<p>Eleven days after Page flew back from Russia to New York, Steele filed a memo to Fusion GPS, the business intelligence firm headed by former Wall Street Journalreporter Glenn Simpson. Simpson had initially begun investigating Trump and Russia at the behest of the Washington Free Beacon, a conservative website. Only later— once Trump had all but secured the nomination—did a law firm employed by the Democrats take over the Trump contract. The fact that Republicans opposed to Trump had begun the inquiry was nowhere to be found in Nunes’ memo.</p>

<p>Dated July 19, 2016, Steele’s field memorandum was titled: “Russia: Secret Kremlin meetings attended by Trump advisor Carter Page in Moscow.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Collusion would mean that the trump campaign was made aware of russian attempts to influence the election. So the russians would have to say &quot; we are going to fuck around with facebook, release damaging information on your opponent, and funnel money to your campaign through back channels that cant be traced.&quot;
Why would they do that? The only thing that produces is risk of being detected, especially with the trump campaign. Russia can do all of those things on it&#39;s own. Why would they expose themselves to what, ask permission? </p>

<p>Maybe. We will never know, and it would have nothing to do with Trump either way.</p>

<p>The way the Russians bought ads on Facebook was not done in a way to maximize the incredibly small budget they had to work with though.</p>

<p>They didn&#39;t make an effort to target battleground states. They targeted &quot;black activists&quot;, LGBT groups, Muslims, and all kinds of weird SJW advertisements. Some Russian ads were anti-Trump. Some Russian ads were pro-Hillary. It was a mess... completely all over the place with who they were trying to target (when they even bothered to target anyone at all).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is certainly suspicious and doesn&#39;t look good for Trump, especially given the allegations of collusion.  But Russia might have just done it because they knew electing Trump would weaken the USA generally, cause division, cause chaos, and leave the USA focused inward with an incompetent administration in charge, leaving Russia to increase its influence worldwide.

<p>Please post the information you have of quid pro quo discussions. By the way, no one here supports those sanctions. We all know they&#39;re bullshit based on CFR propaganda, because Putin stopped ISIS.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/ukraine-phonecall-idUSL2N0LC1E120140207">United States</a> was supporting <a href="http://www.larouchepub.com/eiw/public/2017/eirv44n08-20170224/04-21_4408.pdf">Neo Nazis</a> that started a civil war and violently overthrew the legal government of Ukraine. Crimea joined Russia after a vote, with overwhelming support. The United States deserves to be sanctioned, not Russia.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think the narrative of Russians rigging the election is what people are focused on, what the concern is that Russia communicated with the Trump campaign and offered assistance in return for preferential treatment once elected. We know campaign officials were in communication with Russian officials. We know Russia attempted to influence the election, either via tarted ads or payments to organizations. We know the White House has decided to not enforce sanctions that were voted on and signed by Trump himself. We know Trump pressured Comey for his allegiance and also to make the Flynn problem disappear. We know that he fired Comey for his resistance to the previous two points. This is what people are concerned about.</p>

<p>Because you know nothing about how leverage works.</p>

<p>CAATSA is a big fat report, detailing <em>among other things</em> the specifics of Russia&#39;s oligarchical structure, and the people closest to Putin. This big fat report, when released into the public, serves as <em>a huge hammer</em> with which the US can smash Russia at any moment if they determine their actions are illegitimate. </p>

<p>Why in the world would they give up that leverage for nothing? Especially if it is, as they argue, working as a deterrent against behavior we would not like?</p>

<p>You only think sanctions have been imposed because you have convinced yourself of the foolish narrative that Putin controls Trump, or some nonsensical derivation of that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Trump Jr meeting fits into this narrative too. The deep state attempted to get Trump Jr to suggest a quid pro qou, magnastki act reductions in exchange for hillary dirt. He didnt take the bait and just ended the meeting instead. Which was a setup all along to prove collusion and get FISA warrants on them. That didnt work, so they took steele&#39;s fairy tale to the court instead. </p>

<p>The Crown prosecutor of Russia met with his father Aras this morning and in their meeting offered to provide the Trump campaign with some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father.</p>

<p>This is obviously very high level and sensitive information but is part of Russia and its government&#39;s support for Mr. Trump - helped along by Aras and Emin.</p>

<p>Russia is the United States most important ally for virtually our whole history. They recognized the US very early, sent fleets and military advisors to support the Union against the British-supported South, were our allies in two World Wars and paid <em>dearly</em> to end the threat of the Nazis.</p>

<p>The fact that the British probably murdered FDR to install their puppet Truman and start the lunatic Cold War that enabled the colonial powers to maintain their overseas holdings doesn&#39;t change anything. The USSR collapsed before the average redditor was born.</p>

<p>What do you mean... for what? Do you think the Republicans wanted Trump? He ran against about 15 Republicans, insulted more than that, including the beloved (for some reason) war veteran John McCain, and, well, you get the idea. You could say that Trump was not their first choice...</p>

<p>Maybe his lawyer even told him to lay off for now. He hasn&#39;t lifted the previous sanctions, but if he puts these new ones in that are specifically about the election, it could be used against him by Mueller.</p>

<p>I think by now that Mueller is scraping the bottom of the barrel of the investigation - he will not find collusion - and he would use anything like this just to pin something on Trump himself. Perhaps use it as an admission of guilt in some way. Remember how hesitant Trump always is, even just to admit that Russia tried to influence the election? He doesn&#39;t have to admit there was a two-way agreement (collusion), but he barely even wants to recognize publicly that there was a one-way influence campaign from Russia, which there obviously was.</p>

<p>You see how excited everyone gets when &quot;obstruction of justice&quot; is mentioned, right? That&#39;s because it&#39;s the best case scenario for how the investigation ends if you don&#39;t like Trump. That&#39;s basically all you can hope for at this point, and it&#39;s still a stretch.</p>

<p>If Trump was worried about collusion, the new sanctions would be in place. He&#39;s not concerned about how it looks, or how guilty it looks in the eyes of some people. Why is that? Is it because he&#39;s too stupid to know he shouldn&#39;t be that confident? Or... he just knows there is no collusion?</p>

<p>It would also explain his lack of concern about how firing certain people would appear.</p>

<p>You look at these things as the acts of a guilty man, and I definitely understand how you could see that. But it&#39;s just too obvious for there to be no real charges yet. If he was as stupid as people hoped he was, there would have been charges by now.</p>

<p>So, just pick something at random from my post and dispute it. Don&#39;t tire yourself out. Just dispute one fact. There is some opinion in there, but focus on the facts for now.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Again, you have not disputed any of the facts presented. So this is an irrelevant talking point that is not effective on me. Your world may contain no facts at all, as far as I know.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>but a characterizing theme of his presidency has been failure at nearly every step.</p>

<p>Another characterizing theme has been &quot;resistance&quot; at every step. Much more than the usual sour grapes after a humiliating election defeat. You know that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are things that he has done that I agree with, things I benefit from, but his framework for problem solving is mostly based off of blind confidence and gas lighting.</p>

<p>Now you&#39;re just going back to &quot;he&#39;s stupid&quot;. We&#39;ve been over that. Explain how this stupidity, and this &quot;failure at nearly every step&quot; has not brought out any evidence of &quot;Trump-Russia collusion&quot;.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t stand arguments like this. It&#39;s purely moving the goal posts.

<p>By your logic, that means everything in the dossier is real.</p>

<p>By actual logic, that means the dossier is credible and likely to be true in the rest of its claims.</p>

<p>Also, you guys still haven&#39;t provided actual evidence. You cited fucking Cohens own words! Like, he said he didn&#39;t do something and you thought that counted as proof!</p>

<p>Just because you didn&#39;t read the article, it doesn&#39;t mean you can just make up shit and claim I said that.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not Cohen&#39;s own words. He showed his passport stamps. He gave an alibi that was checked out. And then it was revealed the whole thing was a <a href="https://twitter.com/jaketapper/status/819187673961287681">case of mistaken identity</a>. It was a different guy named Michael Cohen. I&#39;m not even joking. Your hero spy made the same mistake that some idiot doxxer would make.</p>

<p>You can pretend that none of this evidence exists. I really don&#39;t care. It&#39;s too late for that. The Piss Dossier is finished.</p>

<p><strong>Claims:</strong> One of the more significant reports, it again asserts that Page met with Rosneft chief executive Sechin in July. At the meeting, Sechin offered Page and Trump a 19 percent stake in Rosneft in exchange for lifting sanctions on Russia if elected.</p>

<p>It also asserts that Cohen, Trump’s lawyer, was playing a “key role” in the Russia-Trump relationship.</p>

<p><strong>Analysis:</strong> The Rosneft claim received a lot of attention when, in January, a 19.5 percent stake in the company was sold to an unknown buyer. Later reporting, though, indicated that the buyers were companies based in Qatar and Switzerland. It was essentially a loan, and Moscow prearranged to buy back some of the company from the Qataris.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Dossier claims that Russia was cultivating Trump for 8 years...that’s ridiculous at face value.</p>

<p>It also tried to use the fact that he was offered lucrative land deals in Russia, buuuuut turned them down, as evidence that he is somehow beholden to Russia. He turned down the people he was supposedly coopted by? Sure that makes sense.</p>

<p>Carter Page’s released testimony is a long, but interesting read. That guys shreds “Russian Collusion” in his opening statement. He’s also emphatic of his innocence, has never lawyered up for this, has already met with Mueller, is not under indictment and stated that neither Mueller or his team stated he should expect to be indicted in the future, and I assume he’s going to be suing a very large number of people and entities.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the author of the Dossier is suspected of perjury by the US, UK, and FBI, disclosed his findings to media outlets knowing they would disclose information they couldn’t possibly corroborate and that he himself, despite a $50,000 offer of payment-for-corroboration from the FBI, could not corroborate, did not show for his court appearance in London, accepted intel sourced from Clinton confidants (albeit subsequently to the initial dossier). And oh yeah (best part) was working on behalf of the DNC.</p>

<p>I honestly get the impression that a lot of people commenting so passionately on “Trump Russia” have never even read the Dossier or Crowdstrike’s report, or the “Intelligence Community Assessment” related to “Russian Interference”.</p>

The reason we&#39;re here in Conspiracy is because we cannot state matters of fact without the shame units wiping them. Free speech is a beautiful thing.

Trump being shady didn&#39;t bother his voters/non voters, and won&#39;t bother most now. Rather, voting for him has like the metaphor of throwing a brick at the political elites who have ignored the plight of the poor and working class. If dems care more about Russia then they do about actual policies to help the working class, they will lose again. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Weiner foremost in the Dem way of thinking, because his wrongs are most understandable to the average public.</p>

<p>One of the FBI related people more than likely. They are the thugs that get cut loose as chaff. Weiner would twist someone&#39;s arm to make sure this is the choice that happens instead. The Dem elite all know each others&#39; fuck stories and have been complicit in one anothers&#39; raping and rape to ensure and guarantee by threat mutual silence.</p>

<p>If the FBI have a point of compromise in the DNC, then someone straight down the middle would be turned over instead, like Huma Abedin. Close to the most guilty looking but also potentially a fuckup in everyone&#39;s. They could easily manufacture evidence that she was behind some bevvy of hacks and leaks and mishandling of information and the FBI would quickly run with it, close investigation, and bribe a judge to get it all closed as quickly as possible. The papers would parade it as somehow a liberal success and turn their sites right back to Trump. Of course the trial of Abedin would see a photograph of her shaking hands or speaking to a Russia  of some kind.</p>

<p>Wishing this actually all crawls right back up Hillary Clinton&#39;s leg would be like Icarus trying to fly to the sun. By the time any one of Clinton&#39;s wrongs got shouted in public enough to irritate the average public to care, a slew of other people would be going down for the crime in her place, some as sycophantic martyrs. Podesta would probably be found suicided soon after the allegations.</p>

<p>If you throw of all four of them , I guess there&#39;s some non-politically active elite like Harvey Weinstein. Big, in the spotlight, already starting to admit guilty feelings from a remote location. Or just another hit parade of well known film makers and underground art show super freaks. Another few years of that though and Hollywood will be bled dry.</p>

<p>So. Honestly I think it&#39;ll go:</p>

<p>I. Hollywood
II. Abedin
III. FBI
IV. Weiner
V. Podesta
VI. Clinton</p>

<p>Honestly I doubt the American public&#39;s fucks to give ratio will get them past level 2.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. That&#39;s it. No amount of evidence I could produce could ever sway your mind. Trump could hold a press conference and admit:
- He&#39;s either actively cooperated with the Russian government to influence our election, or he purposefully looked away
- He&#39;s trying to destroy the United States from within
- He&#39;s not a billionaire
- He cheated on Melania
- He doesn&#39;t want to be President at all
- He will not stop until he is a dictator for life</p>

<p>Now, anyone with an ounce of sense would believe these things because Trump is a self-absorbed idiot who cannot tell the truth. But you guys, you guys, you&#39;re just <em>convinced</em> of the opposite. So why bother? My blood pressure thanks me. Have a great day!</p>

<p>What&#39;s the problem? That I am focused, while you&#39;re a scatterbrain? Am I not allowed to have interests? Should I post about Pokemon or something to make you happy?

<p>That&#39;s right. You were suicidal and begging for money on Reddit. Like I said, I didn&#39;t want to do this. I&#39;m not heartless. But you want to play detective... so this is how it has to be.</p>

<p>Next time, just stick to the facts. You have none, zero argument, so it turned out this way. Sorry.</p>

<p>P.S: Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump.</p>

<p>Like I said: next time stick to the facts. Come up with an argument. Don&#39;t just be a little bitch about it, searching through someone&#39;s history in order to avoid the facts.

<p>Says the guy who specifically took this to the realm of personal jabs. At least I stayed on topic. You dug up something personal because that&#39;s all you&#39;ve got. </p>

<p>Your posting history about Trump is incredibly relevant to the context of this submission. Don&#39;t pretend like it&#39;s not. That&#39;s why reddit makes your posting history public.</p>

<p>Face it. You&#39;re a Trump lackey who will never be critical of him, no matter what. This, by definition, makes you a shill. It colors everything you say about him with personal bias. You aren&#39;t concerned with facts. You are concerned with defending Trump, and nothing else. When your bias is that obvious, your argument is meaningless. </p>

<p>Literally everyone who cares about an honest discussion on politics.</p>

<p>You do too. Everyone does. </p>

<p>But not everyone goes to such great lengths to display their bias. People who actually care about those facts that you keep mentioning, tend to suppress their bias as much as possible during political discourse. You wear it on your sleeve, which renders your entire argument void. Facts don&#39;t matter when you&#39;ve made up your mind before obtaining said facts.</p>

<p>Again, facts don&#39;t matter to you. Blind support of Trump is what matters to you. In 7 months, you have not had one critical word to say about the president who holds the lowest approval rating of at least the last 7 presidents in their first year.

<p>Please post the information you have of quid pro quo discussions. By the way, no one here supports those sanctions. We all know they&#39;re bullshit based on CFR propaganda, because Putin stopped ISIS.</p>

<p>Oh but it is - it is the basis of the collusion accusations, along with Carter Page being one of the main accused. That&#39;s what this entire post is about. Page and Steele. The two main characters still standing in this collusion story.</p>

<p>And do you understand why people think it&#39;s so unlikely that Carter Page was involved? The TV interviews with no lawyer, the blanket denials and legal action against alleged slander, or how about his history of co-operating with the FBI against Russian spies?</p>

<p>You don&#39;t think Putin might have done a little background research before trusting an FBI snitch with the task of colluding with a US presidential candidate? And if Putin is that stupid to choose Carter Page... why didn&#39;t that stupidity generate any evidence that could be used so far?</p>

<p>We don&#39;t have to agree here though. Mueller is still investigating. We&#39;ll just see what happens.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. That&#39;s it. No amount of evidence I could produce could ever sway your mind. Trump could hold a press conference and admit:
- He&#39;s either actively cooperated with the Russian government to influence our election, or he purposefully looked away
- He&#39;s trying to destroy the United States from within
- He&#39;s not a billionaire
- He cheated on Melania
- He doesn&#39;t want to be President at all
- He will not stop until he is a dictator for life</p>

<p>Now, anyone with an ounce of sense would believe these things because Trump is a self-absorbed idiot who cannot tell the truth. But you guys, you guys, you&#39;re just <em>convinced</em> of the opposite. So why bother? My blood pressure thanks me. Have a great day!</p>

<p>Literally everyone who cares about an honest discussion on politics.</p>

<p>You do too. Everyone does. </p>

<p>But not everyone goes to such great lengths to display their bias. People who actually care about those facts that you keep mentioning, tend to suppress their bias as much as possible during political discourse. You wear it on your sleeve, which renders your entire argument void. Facts don&#39;t matter when you&#39;ve made up your mind before obtaining said facts.</p>
