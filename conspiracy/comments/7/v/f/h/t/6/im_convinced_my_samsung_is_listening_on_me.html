        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So, I&#39;ve always read about the theories of our androids/smart gadgets spying and listening in on us, but I never encountered something that would convince me that it&#39;s definitely happening. Until yesterday. 
  I had just finished work and driving back home(with a friend in the car) and the radios played the song Scandalous, by Mystique. It was a big hit back in the early 2000s and I hadn&#39;t heard the song in YEARS. And I was surprised the radios played it and I talked about this with my friend, while in the car. 
  I get home and i sit on my laptop, reading about some stuff and I put on a random youtube song and just let youtube play. Then suddenly, I hear Scandalous playing from youtube. I have never watched the video/song on youtube and It was random songs being played, chosen by youtube. In all these years, youtube had never suggested the video, nor was it selected to be played when I just put a random song and let it play. I mean, this just cannot be a coincidence. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely. It’s ridiculous to think devices without input mechanism can take anything in, but whatever device can generate any data out of you, is listening. For example, devices with a mic or camera can hear and see you, smart TVs without mic or camera can gather data from your viewing habits, cars connected to GPS or emergency services can gather data on your whereabouts, etc. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nothing has to be designed to spy on anyone.  If it has sensors for inputs from the environment it could easily also have back-door access to those sensors.  Anything that has the capability can be used to spy on you.  Does that mean it is necessarily? No.  But the only way to be sure is to either not use these devices or disable the hardware physically.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>that is a blanket statement that you have no proof of, other than speculation by others. Dont get me wrong, it could be accurate, but you have no way of known it is true that every single device that is connected to a cloud service is harvesting your information and selling it to advertisers. Do you think it means much to an advertiser how many times a light bulb is turned on and off, that corresponds to an email address that may tell them nothing about the user and have no idea who it actually is?</p>

<p>Alexa, Google Home, Siri, etc. Sure they are taking in all sorts of inputs (audio, text searches, viewing habits, etc), but random devices like connected light bulbs or light switches, simple appliances etc. they are not all just selling data on you. And if they are, unlelss you work for those companies, you are full of shit if you claim to know definitively that they are doing so. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not just listening.  Even if there&#39;s no mic, your data is being sent to the owners.  Nest was a wifi enable home thermostat company with $80M in sales when Google paid $3200M for them.  40 times <strong>gross revenue!!</strong>.  Companies are valued at multiples of earnings, not gross sales.</p>

<p>Now Google has millions of devices around the world that can tell them when you&#39;re home, where you are in the house, and even how many people are there.</p>

<p>Then a day later, I get targeted Facebook ads for that band.</p>

<p>Who knows, usually I am able to find alternate explanations but there was this one couple who had never talked or searched or had anything to do with cat food, so they tested it, talked about cat food a whole day - to their phones.</p>
