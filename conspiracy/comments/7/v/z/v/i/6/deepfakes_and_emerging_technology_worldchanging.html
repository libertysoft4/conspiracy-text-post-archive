        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;m curious as to what this sub makes of (what I think is) a &quot;crossing of the Rubicon&quot; moment in tech, one which may have huge consequences and will almost definitely be weaponized in the service of spreading disnformation. </p>

<p>To my mind, we&#39;ve now entered a world in which video evidence can no longer be taken as admissible proof. Anything can be discounted as fake, unless you trust the source (just like how anything reported by CNN or Breitbart could be &quot;fake,&quot; if you&#39;re on the other side of the fence). It&#39;s really interesting to see that the world we&#39;ve been living in - in which video evidence was inarguable - was an aberration, not the rule. Sort of like the short period of time in which the Bramah lock was un-crackable. Seeing is no longer believing. </p>

<p>Maybe I&#39;m just making too much of this. But it seems inevitable that this technology will quickly make the jump from porn to the land of blackmail and cover-ups. Thoughts?</p>

<p>Yes, lol.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This has far reaching implications.  One that came to mind may be paranoid to some but I think it may be a shortcut to face microchipping. </p>

<p>Eventually it could be used as a defense for criminal activities caught on video, a &quot;that wasn&#39;t me&quot; defense.  This in turn could lead to a case that causes great rage, something obvious and heinous where people demand action.  Sorry folks, we have to let him free, the video could have been altered.   And the action?  Here, have a microchip, then we will be able to make sure we get the bad guys and protect the good.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The technology to do this kind of thing has been around for a while, it&#39;s based on the deep dream stuff that allows you to train a computer with data that it can then synthesize in unexpected ways. Before, this was used to create image filters that mimic the style of paintings and other looks. The earliest examples I remember seeing made everything look like a drug trip with distorted dog faces on everything. </p>

<p>Someone just put together a user-friendly software package designed specifically to face swap videos. I think you might be right about this being intentionally made public, but I don&#39;t think it has to do with Trump urine videos. That kind of shit would be really easy to fake even without advanced AI &quot;dreaming&quot; Trump&#39;s face into a body double, and it&#39;s not like weird urine fetishes are even illegal, immoral, or anything. If i was going to try to ruin Trump with a fake video, I&#39;d definitely go in a different direction. Maybe make a fake porn video with a teenaged girl, leak that video all over the internet, then reveal the woman in the video was underage after it had gotten around. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We&#39;ve been able to make fake pornography like this for years. The only difference is that now it&#39;s a lot easier. Before, you&#39;d need a team of professionals, actors, digital effects artists, etc. Or just one person could put together a doctored photo. How often did doctored photos make an impact in society? </p>

<p>Now you just need actors and one person who knows how to train the computer to reproduce the target&#39;s likeness and you can produce believable video. It&#39;s a lot easier now, but the bad actors have had the means to pull off fake videos for years regardless. Hell, look at Hollywood, do you realize that they often use body doubles and special effects for nude scenes in movies? It&#39;s been like this for years. </p>

<p>This is really just an incrementation on what we already had. We might see some changes in society as a result, especially once computers can more easily generate the imagery, but I&#39;m not expecting anything revolutionary. It might even swing the other way, so that any attempt to blackmail someone with video will just be ignored as &quot;fake&quot; since they&#39;re so easy to fake. </p>
