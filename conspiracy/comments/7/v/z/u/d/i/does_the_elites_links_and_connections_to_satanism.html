        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So one topic I see keep popping up again and again is stories that have links to Satanism and the Occult.</p>

<p>On the front page today is a story about Mariah Carey and links to Satanism.</p>

<p>Whether it&#39;s Mariah Carey, Pizzagate, The Rothschild&#39;s or the Iulliminati that come up, satanism and the occult is a reaccuring theme throughout.</p>

<p>I used to be a Christian heavily involved in the church, heck I have a tattoo with the face of Jesus and my favourite Bible verse on my arm, however, I snapped out of it when I realised that religion was used to control the masses and that if I lived in the Middle East chances are I&#39;d be a Muslim, if I lived in Asia chances are I&#39;d be a Buddhist etc. Don&#39;t get me wrong I&#39;m still a spiritual person but I&#39;d describe my beliefs as more Pagan now, I don&#39;t believe any one religion can hold the ultimate truths to this universe and I believe the truth is likely a combination of beliefs from different world religions.</p>

<p>Anyway, I do believe that the elite are messing in the Occult and Satanism, anyone who has reviewed hard evidence (Rothschild 1970 party, Bohemian Grove etc) will see that it&#39;s hard to deny that some of the most powerful people, VIPs and Celebs are dabbling in the Occult and Satansim.</p>

<p>My question is, wouldn&#39;t this confirm that there is in fact a God and that they have some secret knowledge that the general public don&#39;t know. It seems silly to be messing around in Satansim but at the same time to dismiss the Christian God, there can&#39;t be one without the other?</p>

<p>What do you think they know that we don&#39;t, there must be something to it all for it to be a constant reoccuring theme?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agnostic here.  I have really struggled with all the satanic belief clearly existing in the elite world, especially the masonic/Illuminati sects.  No doubt they know something we don&#39;t, but I can&#39;t even begin to speculate on what it might be, or bring myself to swallow everything whole, as far as christianity is concerned.</p>

<p>We&#39;ve been lied to and misled about so much, in my opinion.  Their belief in a boogeyman isn&#39;t enough to sway me into the polar opposite/bible camp just yet, though I agree it warrants keeping an open mind, and doing the best we can with the information we have.</p>

<p>If that&#39;s your rationale, it would seem to &quot;prove&quot; Ahura Mazda more than the Trinity, since the concept of Satan came into Judeo-Christian thought through Persian Zoroastrians.</p>

<p>And who created this world and everything in it, supposedly?  If your god did, then he created all the trees (of life), all the misery, and all the suffering, too, as well as all of his own demands for sacrifices, and slaughterings.  He <em>could</em> have made it good, but he didn&#39;t.  If he&#39;s omniscient and omnipotent, he must&#39;ve made all of that evil and suffering on purpose.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well better late than never. Only God can dictate such judgements without evil intent. </p>

<p>He did create all ‘good.’ He also gave “free will” which resulted in the created beings choosing their own death and subjection to sin, with all its misery.  Sin demands sacrifices, slaughterings and results in suffering.  He provides a substitutionary death through Jesus, providing deliverance for all who believe. </p>

<p>If you feel any conviction whatsoever to become a Christian, I urge you to look into it.  If we die and nothing happens afterwards, then you really haven&#39;t lost anything.  But if Christianity is right, it would mean everything.

    <div class="md"><p>Satan is a pretty minor character in the Bible.  You wouldn&#39;t guess so, based on the satanic hysteria that the modern church promotes, but Satan only has a couple appearances in the Bible, isn&#39;t involved in the Genesis story at all, and is only referred to a couple more times later in the new testament.  He&#39;s featured more in the schizo inspired book of revelations, but how that book even made it into the bible is mind boggling in itself.  It doesn&#39;t match up in any way with other works of &quot;John&quot;, and is a rambling incoherent mess that could be &quot;interpreted&quot; and applied to any and every event on Earth, ever.</p>

<p>With that being said, who is responsible for all of the real evil in the Bible?  Satan tormented Job&#39;s family (via the instructions of God), and...  That&#39;s it.  He tried to get Jesus to eat some bread, too.  Wow!  So evil!</p>

<p>But multiple, repeated genocides?  Infanticides?  That&#39;s Yaweh.  Tormenting all of humanity for all eternity over a petty &quot;fruit eating&quot; grievance?  God.  Inspiring a group of people to roam around and murder any and all people who crossed their paths?  Him again.  Possessing people?  Good ol yaweh again.  He even manages to punish them for being possessed by him. (Pharaoh vs Moses, and Saul vs David).  Hatred of the entire human race?  God again.</p>

<p>Judging from the written track record, I wouldn&#39;t fear much from satanists.  The majority are just angsty emo edgelords.  But those fanatical followers of &quot;God&quot;?  Watch out for those sadistic bastards.  They&#39;ll have their god tell them to slaughter you, then turn around and blame you for needing to be slaughtered.  Just look at what they&#39;ve done to the middle east...  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Couldn&#39;t agree more with what you&#39;re saying, this is one of the reasons I got out of Christianity but what I&#39;m saying applies to all Abrahamic based religions, it&#39;s crazy how religious fanatics instantly dismiss the atrocities their God has committed.</p>

<p>You hit the nail on the head really, when considering the evils that the scriptures say God himself has committed and then combine that with all of the atrocities that have been committed for as far back as we can go in Gods name and the atrocities that continue to be committed in &#39;Gods&#39; name, I&#39;d rather leave any organised religion like that at the door.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes you are so right about being born in areas make you x believer more. As an asian I really side with both Buddhism and as American, side with Christianity. We can also where there is s divine creator he may or my not ever interfere with us. Sorta how Buddhist &amp; Deists believe in God. But yea Satanist believe more so in God to rebel against him. They are the left hand path to Christian&#39;s right hand path.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The further you dig, the clearer the esoteric connections of all this worlds powers becomes. It&#39;s all linked in the worship of &quot;other gods.&quot; Though many pose as Christians their practices and teachings are occult in nature, and Biblically unsound.</p>

<p>The book of Revelation is also quite the eye opener once you understand what the terms mean.</p>

<p>Woman/Whore = Church or religious group</p>

<p>Beast = kingdom/governmental system</p>

<p>Sea = &quot;peoples&quot; as in the population of Europe/middle East</p>

<p>Earth = sparsely populated area/apart from the &quot;sea.&quot; </p>

<p>Taking this into consideration, America would be the &quot;beast out of the Earth, with the appearance of a lamb (Christianity), with 2 horns (2 party system/church and state)  of which the 1st beast (Rome/Roman Catholicism) gave it its power.&quot; Ever wonder why the pope is calling for a new world order?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This thought often gave me pause.  I don’t believe in “God” but I think that the Elite worship Satan.  You can’t have one without the other.  My only “logical” answer, and by no means do I believe this to be 100% accurate, is that “Satan” and “demons” could just be inter dimensional beings that the Elite bring in to make themselves more powerful.  I believe in possession and a “life” after death.  I believe in reincarnation as well.  </p>
