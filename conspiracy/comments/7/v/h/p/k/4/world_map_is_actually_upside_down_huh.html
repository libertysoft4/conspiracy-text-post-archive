    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>What we view as being &quot;north&quot; or &quot;south&#39; is the direction that the sun falls or orbits.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This isn&#39;t correct. Maybe you&#39;ve gotten confused by the variety of different &quot;norths&quot; people talk about.</p>

<p>North on Earth is toward the North Pole, being one of the two points where the earth&#39;s rotational axis intersects the surface. This is wholly arbitrary; the concept of &quot;north&quot; originates with the fact that north is to your left when you face the rising sun … approximately.</p>

<p><em>Solar</em> north is the direction away from then sun which, when you look at the ecliptic from that direction, the earth is moving counter-clockwise. Solar north is vaguely in the same direction as polar north, but it&#39;s angled away by about 23°.</p>

<p><em>Galactic</em> north is the direction away from the center of the galaxy which, when you look at the galaxy from that direction, the <em>sun</em> and the solar system are orbiting counter-clockwise. Galactic north is angled away from solar north by about 60°.</p>

<p>There is no meaningful correlation between galactic north and polar north. The only connection between the two is that the entire galaxy and all the matter in it has similar total angular momentum, originating far back in astronomical time when the galaxy was just a diffuse cloud of matter collapsing under its own weight. That cloud had a net angular momentum, and because angular momentum is conserved, the galaxy today still has that same angular momentum. This is why stuff orbits other stuff in the first place, rather than having long since collapsed into a big wad of matter with no rotation.</p>

<p>It&#39;s just a model, and definitely has some inconsistencies, but this doesn&#39;t change the fact that the sun is moving in a direction. You&#39;re looking at it backwards if you&#39;re viewing the sun as being &quot;stationary&quot; with respect to the Earth, and perhaps that&#39;s my fault for not stating things more clearly. But what I&#39;m asking is, using Earth directions for reference where north means the North Pole and south means the South Pole, in which direction is the Sun moving? It doesn&#39;t have to be an exact cardinal direction but the sun is always moving a direction, regardless of its orbital plane. That geocentric direction is actually all I&#39;m interested in. Which Earth direction does our solar system fall towards while orbiting the solar system?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have the wherewithal to understand that the sun orbits around the galactic center, but you still try to define the sun&#39;s movement based on an object that is <em>orbiting and rotating</em> around the sun itself? There is no useful answer to that because you have the importance of your variables backwards.</p>

<p>The only &quot;geocentric&quot; variable that even comes close to mattering to what you&#39;re asking is the center of the Earth&#39;s orbit (which, for so many reasons, puts you back at square one in this question). You could I suppose physically point a direction that the sun is moving at a specific date and time, but that answer will immediately change and never be the same again; a year later on the same date and time the entire system will have moved. It&#39;s based on a location on the earth which is based on it&#39;s position around the sun which is based on it&#39;s position around the galactic center, and if you want to scale out one more time, is based on some vector from the center of the universe. It&#39;s a fool&#39;s thought experiment and the best you could hope for is a guy pointing either at the sky or at the ground and say &quot;about that way.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>so the question is if its a conspiracy that maps show northern hemisphere &quot;on top&quot; of the south?</p>

<p>I think it probably has more to do with who was making the maps when crossing the Atlantic became consistently do able. So Europeans probably orientated their maps in a way that placed things how they are and have remained that way for the most part since then. They may have unknowingly been biased in how they depicted the world but I doubt it was a conspiracy to depict some places as less than others.     </p>
