        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I happened on a <a href="https://i.imgur.com/lT0BBZ9.jpg">good standup bit</a> about our blatantly farcical airport security theater industrial complex, and I guess I was at the right level of buzzed and stoned for epiphanies. The TSA is specifically meant to target well off people and get them used to authoritarianism in the most convoluted, sugercoated way possible. The kind of people who can afford to fly regularly and be annoyed at the antics of the TSA are the kind of people who can afford to buy past the microtransactional brand of tyranny levied on the urban poor masses, and are thus not beaten down enough for the ruling class&#39;s liking. So in machiavellian unison with doing that whole 9/11 thing to give them an excuse when it got out that we&#39;re all being wiretapped, they got an excuse to turn airport terminals into disneylandized internment camp portals.</p>

<p>Who knows what kind of hell-society they&#39;re laying the groundwork for with all this mass surveillance and police militarization/automation, but it&#39;s gonna be pretty fucking scary if we let it happen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh bother. If you wanna get metaphysical on me, shit, it&#39;s been a while since I tripped balls and interacted with the transmundane but hell, I&#39;ll throw down. The nature of this world is hugely physical, the material and spiritual are functionally indistinct anyways. Those spheres inform and affect each other so much they&#39;re practically one. The conscious, spiritual aspects of our world and universe emerge from material interactions on every scale, and in turn affect and invent those same material interactions. And when powers collide in our locality, they&#39;re not praying or shooting arcane bolts, the most magical thing they&#39;re doing is weaponizing memes. When the shit hits the fan, it&#39;s men, guns, missiles and trucks that decide the outcome.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know for a fact that the physicality you think you feel/see is not physical at all. You are in spirit right now, in christ, with B-IO-LO-GI-CA-L stimulative elements specifically geared to help you transition into a body in the actual physical.

    <div class="md"><p>What makes you think that Jesus = Christ? Because of (first name) Jesus (last name) Christ? As in, the last name before Jesus was used was Christ... </p>

<p>&quot;Jesus&quot; is in Christ, and so is this &quot;world,&quot; so &quot;they&quot; can &quot;meet.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Christ&quot; is the reference to a place of common-ground(s) in which different types/forms of entities can meet... Like if you were going to meet God, you would meet God in Christ, because that is common-ground in which you both could stand together in forms which relate to each other..</p>

<p>You are 100% correct about being an exercise to tame the &quot;upper-middle class&quot;. I&#39;ve had my junk groped aggressively was as a response to my rejection of the Rape-is-scan many times and still do occasionally if my answers our out of line with their questioning. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not an elitist by any means, but there is a personal axe to grind by a lot of the TSA folks that love to flex their little piece of authority over anyone that they might perceive as resistant to the training they are providing to the public.

<p>Do you have specific historical examples of this? It&#39;s an interesting theory, and would be effective logically, but it seems like in reality, most violence used by autocratic rulers is top-down; the leader&#39;s troops stop rebellion. And any incidence of &#39;poor troops in rich neighborhoods&#39; are the result of uprisings like the French or Bolshevik Revolutions, people fed up with the system take up arms. Are there examples in history where both sides are being played conversely against each other like you suggest?</p>

<p>That&#39;s why the tactic of blatent duality is abandond. Today  it is more covert and split up in many levels of created dualities.</p>

<p>By focussing on one part that is going wrong to one part of a population it is easy to get caught up in duality and completely miss all other points related to the same basic problem while sometimes adding to the problem at the same time.</p>

<p>It are not a few people under attack, no, the whole of humanity is under attack on many levels simultanious. People are being distracted and kept in misery for many reasons, but the most importent reason is to keep us from uniting and finding out our true natural powers.</p>

<p>Rich vs. pour,</p>

<p>Colour vs. colour,</p>

<p>Religion vs. science.</p>

<p>Religion vs. religion,</p>

<p>Spiritual vs. materialistic,</p>

<p>Race vs. race,</p>

<p>Native vs. immigrants,</p>

<p>Left vs. right,</p>

<p>Chemtrails vs. non chemtrails,</p>

<p>Vaxers vs. non-vaxers,</p>

<p>Vegetarian vs. meat lover,</p>

<p>Flat earth vs. round earth,</p>

<p>Red pill vs. blue pill and i could go on and on and on, but i think you get the picture, it is always &quot;them vs. &quot;us&quot; or vs. &quot;me&quot;</p>

<p>We are all humans, we are basicly all the same and all part of one. Fighting amongst ourselves over all superficial and created duality is hurting us all and makes that we miss the most important things in this &quot;reality&quot;. Becouse all the biggering between us we are being distracted from looking into the actual source of all duality and it pushes us into a victom mode instead of the Loving mode we should be in. Our ego is part of the problem here and it shines through in any thought we have and action we make while creating our &quot;reality&quot;.</p>

<p>The above list of &quot;dualities&quot; only seem dualities in this 3D &quot;reality&quot; we are experiencing, if you start looking deeper within yourself you will find out we are indeed all one and everything is energy.</p>

<p>There are two energies governing this reality and one &quot;rule&quot;:</p>

<p>We all have created this maze we are in, the truth will show us the way through it and Love will shine a light so you don&#39;t need to stumble too much. Fear is used to create duality and negativety that is keeping us distracted so we don&#39;t see the truths that could lead us to the most beautifull path through this maze. But sadley enough many people will let themselves be led to the most dark locations some can think of becouse they get too distracted to even see the maze we are in.</p>

<p>We have the power for change within ourselves, but we&#39;ll need to figure out who we actually are and what we are capable of before we can use our power in the most effective and Loving way. Fighting over any created duality is not helping any cause and violence is even making the problems worse. In the beginning we are all one, there is enough for everybody and once we find the truth within ourselves there is no reason for fear left.</p>

<p>Reasoning over any unnatural unbalance and trying to solve the actual problems can help, but we should include everything in these conversations and not get too focussed on just one (easy to miss-use) sliver of the huge problem we have as humanity.</p>

Maybe you don&#39;t see it now, but are we realy all seperated from each other, or could it be better if we unite instead of fight?</p>

<p>Please have my up-vote, it seems you are now on -1 and that is kind of sad while you have taken the time to reply on my post.</p>

<p>I get the &quot;Pit side A verse side B&quot; control mentality. But the claim was about playing each side against each other in a much more literal sense. I&#39;d be interested in seeing information on not just putting rich white cops in black neighborhoods, but simultaneously placing under paid black cops in rich white neighborhoods. (or like wise situations.)</p>

<p>Now i wanted to quote the last sentence and question of the OP to wich i replied, but that is gone now. A parafrase of his question was:</p>

<p>Do you know of anything in the past that has set 2 or more fractions up against each other?</p>

<p>My reply was intended as a hint that these kind of &quot;games&quot; are being played for as long as the history of humanity and are still playing in the present.</p>

<p>And to tie my reply further to the original post, the TSA is just a small part of the huge problem we have as humanity.</p>

<p>It&#39;s probably not a conspiracy, just the result of our culture accepting some of the dystopian norms that have become a part of modern life. I found this commercial to be disturbing too, where Samuel L. Jackson is some kind of interrogator trying to coerce people into using a certain type of credit card:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe. From my travels. I know the whole system is pointless. The fancy scanners always give me false positives. Specifically on my neck and lower legs. And the scanner clearly isn&#39;t that important, since when the lines get long we just go through the regular metal one and we&#39;re off.</p>

<p>And if anyone here flys out of MCO like I do. Why do they more security at the monorail, and why is there a sign saying &quot;additional screening&quot; when I&#39;m leaving the airport? </p>
