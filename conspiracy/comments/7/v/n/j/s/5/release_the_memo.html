    <div class="md"><p>Well it wasnt hasty, but the key here is the response should be allowed out. </p>

<p>Thats part of the American political process. present the dissenting opinion along with the original and allow the public to be duly informed and make their own choices. </p>

<p>This is the crux of america, discussion. When one opinion is silenced then you cant stand there and say that you are a true american all the while applauding the purposeful restriction of information and counterpoints just because you dont agree with them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There’s no suspense over the counter memo.</p>

<p>Schiff said it’s not redacted and it’s been through the same process as the GOP one. It’s also been approved by the house and is waiting for Trump’s approval.</p>

<p>Trump has to release his hands are tied. If he blocks it that will automatically invalidate the Nunes memo pretty much entirely.</p>

<p>Also no one is going on 20 minute interviews trying to argue the Dems shouldn’t get their counter argument. All the GOP did was require the Dems memo went through the same process with their memo as the GOP did.</p>

<h1>ReleasetheMemo erupted from Schiff and Pelosi throwing out every excuse they could think of to not release it. No one in the GOP is trying to stonewall the Dems memo. That’s the difference.</h1>

He also said that they are investigating about a dozen people in the FBI that acted improperly, which would corroborate the memo.

Would you rather have congressman putting their name on something that makes claims directly linked to the basis of those claims, or would you rather have them anonymously leak to the press with vague statements that can’t be tied to the person/entity that could verify those claims?</p>

<p>“A document of politically motivated lies pretending to be official evidenced truth” .....you do understand the same could be said of the Steele Dossier right? That’s the whole point of this shit show.</p>

<p>Also who cares if some R’s opposed release? John McCain not wanting a document released when he gobbled up the Dossier and fed it to a reporter just doesn’t really surprise or tell me anything.</p>

<p>If you doubt the memo that’s good, everyone should until corroborating evidence or disproving evidence comes out. Point is that can actually happen since it wasn’t redacted.</p>

<p>Releasing a document without redactions is actually a refreshing step for our government.</p>

<p>Due to that nature if its full of lies, that can be proven or corroborated. Journalists/officials know exactly where to look for the evidence they need.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Untrue. The memo relies on unclassified material, and we&#39;re to take Nunes word for the key parts. There are simply contradictions, which means <em>something</em> is a lie, but because we&#39;re just writing stupid memos <em>about</em> documents instead of <em>actually releasing the documents</em>, there&#39;s no way to tell which part is the lie.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If the new norm is releasing intel without redactions I’m all for it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But that&#39;s not what they&#39;re doing, what they&#39;re doing is congressmen &quot;summarizing&quot; intel for us, without actually declassifying it. It&#39;s no different from the old &quot;a source familiar with the matter said...&quot; trick but done by government officials themselves.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t give a shit about the spin or talking points that congressmen use to play politics. It&#39;s not transparency, it&#39;s not exposure, it&#39;s just politics-as-usual in a new medium (MEMOS!!!)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“A document of politically motivated lies pretending to be official evidenced truth” .....you do understand the same could be said of the Steele Dossier right? That’s the whole point of this shit show.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, it&#39;s not hte same. The Steele Dossier was a work of opposition research, thus the incentive is on accuracy and truthfulness. Opposition research is useless if it&#39;s false, because then it leads the campaign to adopt a strategy that&#39;s at odds with reality. </p>

<p>The Nunes memo is designed to set a narrative, he wrote it in order for it to be eventually released and you&#39;re an idiot if you think otherwise. One has the incentive to be truthful, the other has the incentive to lie.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you doubt the memo that’s good, everyone should until corroborating evidence or disproving evidence comes out. Point is that can actually happen since it wasn’t redacted.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;re being a sap, honestly. A congressmen takes his talking points that he&#39;d normally just say on Hannity and puts them in a memo and suddenly you think it&#39;s more credible and &quot;is a move toward transparency&quot;, what a fucking joke.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Releasing a document without redactions is actually a refreshing step for our government.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is beyond dense. Nunes didn&#39;t dig around, find some documents, and get them released. He <em>wrote something with the intent of releasing it</em>. It&#39;s just a new, different route to deliver talking points and propaganda to the public.</p>

<p>I want the source material too, but how in the hell were they just gonna release that? We will never get that info without these idiots playing dueling memos because now each side is incentivizing the other to release more info to counter the claims of either side.</p>

<p>If these memos necessitate the release of more source doc info then I’m all for it. If it’s just bullshit as usual then you make valid points.</p>

<p>There was absolutely no chance of ANY source doc information being disclosed without these two parties trolling each other.</p>

<p>If you really think oppo research is valid at face value then you’re the idiot. “Clinton Cash” was essentially oppo research. Should we use that to get a FISA warrant on Hillary and Bill?</p>

<p><a href="http://fox59.com/2018/01/30/republicans-vote-to-release-classified-memo-on-russia-probe/">Article 1</a> </p>

<p>Committee unanimously voted to release Democrat memo to public</p>

<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/trump-attacks-schiff-ahead-of-vote-on-democrats-russia-probe-memo/2018/02/05/abf388fc-0a8c-11e8-8b0d-891602206fb7_story.html?utm_term=.b6a26c7cc731">Article 2</a> </p>

<p>The Republican memo had already been released for House viewing prior to the vote to release it publicly, which then needed White House approval.</p>

<p>You can find videos wherein house members explain that the Democrat memo needed to follow the same process to be released if you want more proof.</p>

<p>That process was followed and now it’s been unanimously voted to release publicly.</p>

<p>No one is trying to block the Dems memo, but yeah they did require it go through the same process as the Republican memo.</p>

<p>In theory Trump still could block it, but that’d be dumb as that would completely invalidate Nunes memo regardless of any follow up to corroborate it’s claims.</p>

<p>What it sounds like to me was that the Republicans and Trump administration tried to get the Republican memo out as fast as possible and not give Democrats the time to release a memo at the same time as the other memo. This was done strategically to make sure that the Republican memo was out first and allowed all of the talking points to go out without any official rebuttals against it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>1) Nuns crafts memo, that memo is released to the House</p>

<p>2) Schiff crafts memo. Asks for memo to be publicly released along with Nunes memo</p>

<p>3) House releases Nunes memo, blocks Schiff memo but votes to release to the house with the acknowledgment that it will be released subsequently to following same process as Nunes memo</p>

<p>4) House releases Schiff memo</p>

<p>Nunes memo release was voted on party lines. Schiff memo release was voted unanimously.</p>

<p>Prior to Nunes memo Schiff and Pelosi got in front of any camera they could shitting on it and claiming it threatened national security.</p>

<p>Republicans have not publicly shit on Schiff’s memo, they just required it to follow the same process. Once it did, even the Republicans voted for its release.</p>

<p>Democrats never voted for release, tried to discredit at every opportunity. Republicans unanimously vote to release once memo completes process required for public release.</p>

<p>This is all verifiable. Interpret events how you’d like, but I don’t know how you argue Republicans are the ones trying to prevent public release of information.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe the WH brought in the FBI/DOJ to review the memo. They were allowed to request edits, which Schiff then screamed bloody murder about.</p>

<p>So both memos got their review, both will have come out with no redactions (Schiff has said their memo isn’t redacted).</p>

<p>Look regardless of party lines shouldn’t we all be happy these guys are actually having to put their name on a document that makes claims directly linked to the person/entity/document that can corroborate those claims?</p>

<p>Another commenter is arguing this is devolution and that these guys should’ve just given info to a reporter. An article attributed to anonymous sources that makes short vague statements that conveniently are limited in scope...I mean how is that not the ultimate political cherry picking?</p>

<p>At least these guys are having to duke it out in the open without hiding behind anonymity or redactions. Who knows how it will play out, but at least things are being pushed more out into the open.</p>

<p>I’m certain the Nunes memo is very R friendly and I’m certain the Schiff memo is very D friendly. Doesn’t mean either doc is 100% true or 100% false. The memos will force more stuff out into the open and the truth will probably lie somewhere in the middle.  As long as these memos necessitate the disclosure of more information, it’s a good thing as far as I’m concerned.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The memo was released without redactions. Due to that nature if its full of lies, that can be proven or corroborated. Journalists/officials know exactly where to look for the evidence they need.</p>

<p>Same will hopefully be true of the Schiff memo.</p>

<p>If the new norm is releasing intel without redactions I’m all for it. Would you rather have congressman putting their name on something that makes claims directly linked to the basis of those claims, or would you rather have them anonymously leak to the press with vague statements that can’t be tied to the person/entity that could verify those claims?</p>

<p>“A document of politically motivated lies pretending to be official evidenced truth” .....you do understand the same could be said of the Steele Dossier right? That’s the whole point of this shit show.</p>

<p>Also who cares if some R’s opposed release? John McCain not wanting a document released when he gobbled up the Dossier and fed it to a reporter just doesn’t really surprise or tell me anything.</p>

<p>If you doubt the memo that’s good, everyone should until corroborating evidence or disproving evidence comes out. Point is that can actually happen since it wasn’t redacted.</p>

<p>Releasing a document without redactions is actually a refreshing step for our government.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you can&#39;t. CNN told you it&#39;s not what happened and the House Intelligence Committee showed you classified information that it is. Funny how you believe CNN when all they have is spin and not actual evidence when produced by your elected officials...</p>

<p>They did not.  They showed us a memo that Nunes wrote based on what Gowdy saw.  Then Gowdy undermined that memo.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s the lazy CNN spin. Gowdy actually cowrote the memo. He also said that they are investigating about a dozen people in the FBI that acted improperly, which would corroborate the memo. He did say that the Mueller investigation should remain and for some reason CNN obfuscated those two separate things and said that it undermined the memo. That makes no sense, surprised you just took their word for it instead of taking even a cursory glance at what he said.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well the Nunes memo was pretty hilariously ill conceived and laughable. So theres a high mark for this one to be ‘amusing’. </p>
