        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>There should be an immediate release of security footage showing the shooter moving the massive amount of guns in respective luggage through hotel.  Not the grainy choppy footage like the pentagon 9/11 footage. This story doesn&#39;t add up at all. Lone wolf? BS. Old Crotchety Gambling Man? BS. No motive? Definitely BS.</p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>It shouldn&#39;t be hard to pull up parking lot footage, front desk footage, and plenty of other security cameras throughout the hotel and casino. Also would definitely want access to all parking lot footage as I have a feeling there would be nothing with our supposed shooter but there would be something suspicious about someone else or another van or car. They have been selling this Lone Wolf idea for a long time and the consequences pretty much are well known. There is no doubt there is an assault on the second amendment in this country. Might as well point out that the fake news narrative regardless of how true it is or not is an assault on our first amendment with similar desire by the powers that be to impede the freedom of the people of this great nation. If either of these amendments are lost or changed in such a way that prohibits freedom, there will be dire consequences facing the future of the greatest concept of a free people this world had ever seen. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d say there is no better investigative power than the general public. Why are such things kept secret and handled by only a select few people? Would it not solve crimes faster and more accurately to involve as many people as possible? I understand certain limitations, such as not tipping of suspects by keeping things under wraps, but according to the media, this is a clear cut case so why the hang up?</p>

<p>As said in another comment, they will come up with millions of &quot;reasons&quot; not to do this and I could probably come up with at least 3 or 4 if I cared to.</p>

<p>The most obvious though: They want to be seen as the heroes who save the day. They don&#39;t really want any civilian to trump them.</p>

<p>Another aspect is of course: What&#39;s to investigate?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One reason might be internal to the casino itself. They don&#39;t want to make it obvious to people who gamble there that they are being closely watched by thousands upon thousands of security cameras.  By making all the footage public, it gives a potential in to someone who might want to scam / rob / rip off the casino.</p>

<p>If you know exactly what the surveillance system is capable of, you also know its vulnerabilities. This fact is used in the intelligence community.  This is why they won&#39;t release security camera footage of the Pentagon from 9/11.  They don&#39;t want to give away ANY information.  If you know anything at all about the cameras, that&#39;s giving up information asymmetry.  They will never willingly do that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But vegas casinos are unlikely to have a single square foot that isnt covered by security cameras. I understand your point but I also dont know how much it would help criminals to have footage of the lobby. If they were really that concerned then release stills. There are literally thousands of cameras in a casino and a still image from less than 5 probably wouldnt even be useful to the cast of oceans 11</p>

<p>Give how many people in this sub, based on comments and upvotes, don&#39;t understand the simple fact that guns can be broken down and that people moving luggage in a hotel with 1000+ rooms isn&#39;t suspicious I have reason to doubt that statement.</p>

<p>Furthermore some in this sub, and the general public, tends to not examine things in a rational way instead they search for things that support what they already believe and put less weight on those which go against their current beliefs.</p>
