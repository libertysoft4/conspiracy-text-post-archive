        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>1) Do you guys remember just two weeks ago at the Mcgregor-Mayweather fight when NFL star Michael Bennet was arrested? Well do you guys remember why he was arrested? Because there was an active shooter situation at a hotel. I&#39;ll just put the link here of the story <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.thesun.co.uk/news/4337262/armed-cops-las-vegas-cromwell-hotel-eubank-jr-floyd-mayweather-conor-mcgregor/amp/">https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.thesun.co.uk/news/4337262/armed-cops-las-vegas-cromwell-hotel-eubank-jr-floyd-mayweather-conor-mcgregor/amp/</a></p>

<p>2) the active shooter situation about a month ago got very little USA MSM media attention other than &quot;look at this racism.&quot; No MSM outlets talked about the fact that there was an active shooter situation in Las Vegas at a huge boxing match which is kind of a huge deal. That seems suspicious to me.</p>

<p>3) I believe that the case I&#39;m referring to was used as a drill. I mean does anybody even know if there was an active shooter? Was anyone even hurt? How coincidental can it be that this occurred just two weeks before the largest massacre in US history? </p>

<p>Something fishy is going on with this. If you guys find out anymore about this let me know. We need to get to the bottom of this</p>

<p>(Edit) since I assumed everyone heard about the Michael Bennet thing I didn&#39;t post an article on Michael Bennett. I didn&#39;t think that aspect mattered but here&#39;s one of the many articles on the Michael Bennett situation <a href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/local/the-strip/sheriff-las-vegas-police-had-reasonable-suspicion-to-stop-michael-bennett/">https://www.reviewjournal.com/local/the-strip/sheriff-las-vegas-police-had-reasonable-suspicion-to-stop-michael-bennett/</a></p>

<p>(Edit 2) Some more info that I&#39;ve gathered that has me scratching my head. 
The police were on the 32nd floor for an hour before going in. Is that usual? Would they not break down the door right away so that they can stop the dude from spraying down citizens? Or was he done shooting at citizens by the time the police got to the door? Cause they stood outside of the door for like 30 minutes I believe.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think that&#39;s enough to disprove the correlation. How often are there active shooter scenarios in Las Vegas where swat team comes in their gear with automatic rifles telling people to get down and evacuate? Also, how often would the fact that there was an active shooter situation in Las Vegas not be reported on by MSM? I don&#39;t think the scale is enough to dismiss it. How would they even be able to run a drill on the same scale as last night&#39;s tragedy? They wouldn&#39;t be able to without drawing huuuuge suspicion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But yeah it&#39;ll definitely be used to promote metal detector&#39;s mandatory in Las Vegas which is another nice removal of our privacy. As you can already see it&#39;s also being used on a nation-wide scale to promote gun control. They want the guns man. Guns being removed from the citizens is and has been a huge priority </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s understood that the active shooter scenario in your original post was a falsely reported one right ( <a href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/crime/las-vegas-strip-nightclub-evacuated-after-reports-of-shooting/">https://www.reviewjournal.com/crime/las-vegas-strip-nightclub-evacuated-after-reports-of-shooting/</a> ) ? There were zero shots fired and police were barking commands to stay down. </p>

<p>What happened last night was rapid fire coming from high up with multiple people shot before police came. I&#39;m not really seeing the correlation. Vegas has crime problems but they&#39;re brushed under the rug a lot more to not fuck with the tourist income. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Violence after major boxing matches is fairly common all the way back to 2pac. Add a combination of booze, fighting, and people who think they’re important and you get a deadly combo. I’ve been in town for several major boxing and major ufc fight and always there’s a near stampede coming out followed by some fight. During these fights the word “gun” can get shouted and then snowball into mass panic which is what I believe occurred here. Personally, I believe these are two separate incidents, but appreciate the critical thinking that brought this back up. If any sort of suggestion otherwise (same guy spotted around this incident) then I stand corrected.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>it is an official photo. its just that you dont understand that social media is used to promote items to weave a narrative. then other people like yourself redistribute it and that becomes the story they want.</p>

<p>any other photos or videos? funny cause there were 20k people there.  the other week when that car jammed into a crowd of 100 people there were tons of injuries shown. that was a real event. and here we are with only 2 fake photos</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why&#39;d you refer to that one part of my statement? All politicians make sneaky deals with other countries with the exception of a few I&#39;m sure. Also Russia only meddles in things that would help a democrat. For example: the BLM account they had on Twitter. So yeah Russia&#39;s meddling sure does get the liberals fired up because who knows how many other BLM accounts Russia runs. Would that not be an attack on our society and causing chaos?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah it&#39;s definitely not a strobe light. For 100% sure not a strobe light . The light stops after the sound of gunfire stops. And I don&#39;t know how many strobe lights come in muzzle gun fire color.

To insinuate that because we look at evidence in an objective manner and don&#39;t take what we&#39;re told as fact we&#39;re going to kill a mass number of people? I mean how do you even draw an idiotic conclusion like that? I can already tell facts don&#39;t matter to you because you just said because I believe something to be true you&#39;re worried that I may kill a mass number of people.

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. It&#39;s 2017 and somehow security cameras have degraded in quality so much that they are nonexistent. Should be a dead giveaway for any of the situations that bring the suspect into question. Like Sandyhook for example. One of the argument is they couldn&#39;t see a kid with aspergers caring that much weight in guns and ammunition. Surveillance video would easily show how it went down. I wish they would show the shit so that people can quit coming up with theories on how he did it. It&#39;s like a bunch of people arguing about what&#39;s inside a box when They could easily just open up the box and look.</p>

<p>Sorry idk if that was supposed to be some kind of racial jab or whatever but it looks a lot like him. A lot of other people agree. </p>

<p>Do you know what a &quot;super recognizer is&quot;? <a href="http://superrecognisers.com/">http://superrecognisers.com/</a>
There are people who are particularly good at recognizing faces, and tests which determine this. 
I&#39;ve scored over 80 percent when I took those tests so my opinion in this matter counts.</p>

<p>Also here is a 4chan post i saw:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Posting theories</p>

<p>Leftist?
(POSSIBLY DEBUNKED) Possibly spotted at anti-Trump rallies (This is still being investigated, PJW is skeptical)
A Stephen Paddock worked for NASA
Guy at anti-Trump rally had a NASA shirt on, looks like Steve, woman calls him steve in the video
MAYBE NOT DEBUNKED: See pic related, Steve Morph</p>

<p>Alex Jones FBI Hostage team source: Antifa literature found in hotel room after he was shot
Attacked a country music concert full of republicans
Anniversary of the Bolshevik Revolution
Antifa undercover video from Stephen Crowder shows Antifa planning &quot;stabbing and shooting attacks&quot;, procuring assault rifles for attacks in next 2 months
AJ sources said it&#39;s going down in October</p>

<p>(Sky News, Witness Brianna) - hispanic woman pushed her way to first row of concert, said &quot;You are all going to die tonight&quot; 45 min before shots, kicked out by security</p>

<p>Brother and Niece say he was not religious - commie atheist?
GF (Marilou Danley) left the country recently for unknown reasons - maybe she cucked him and stole his gambling money</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Using a throwaway. I&#39;m a Vegas native, I work with the casinos extensively on a daily basis. I&#39;ve noticed this year there have been a couple of &quot;active shooter&quot; situations that particularly stand out. They are also directly related to MGM Resorts for some reason. </p>

<p>On march 25th there was a Bellagio jewelry store robbery with 3 suspects. Only one of them was caught and the 2 suspects had to flee on foot due to their car keys being misplaced. The whole story sounds extremely strange and fishy. They even wore pig masks to add dramatic effect. 2 suspects still at large, no news since. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/crime/robberies/bellagio-robbery-suspect-told-las-vegas-police-his-family-was-threatened/">https://www.reviewjournal.com/crime/robberies/bellagio-robbery-suspect-told-las-vegas-police-his-family-was-threatened/</a></p>

<p>Of course this caused a major police response shutting down the casino and Las Vegas blvd. </p>

<p>On the same day a few hours after the burglary someone was shot just outside between the Bellagio and Cosmopolitan on the public transit bus. This caused even more police presence and the entire road block was shut down. 3 casinos were put on lockdown due to the situation. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/crime/shootings/1-dies-in-fatal-bus-shooting-on-las-vegas-strip-hours-after-bellagio-burglary/">https://www.reviewjournal.com/crime/shootings/1-dies-in-fatal-bus-shooting-on-las-vegas-strip-hours-after-bellagio-burglary/</a></p>

<p>Both of these incidents caused a large police presence and I believe were used as active shooter drills to prep for this type of event. </p>

<p>On the night of this route 91 shooting I was on my way to the airport at approximately 10:30pm and I noticed the freeway was shut down, Tropicana was shut down and las vegas blvd was also shut down. Henderson PD, Nevada highway patrol, north Las Vegas, Las Vegas PD, undercover, and every paramedic ambulance was there in less than 15 minutes. If you&#39;re from here you know that these police departments rarely collaborate with each other as the city is segmented between each police department. </p>

<p>This had to have been planned for the amount of coordination going on. The scanners make it seem like a shit show but in reality everything was shutdown extremely quick and response time was immediate. The airport flights were even diverted. </p>

<p>On top of this my parents who each work at 2 completely different casino companies have also had active shooter drills in the last year including me which are mandatory. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the insight! I appreciate it. Also, you want to know why the MSM organizations were already in Las Vegas for the massacre? OJ Simpson was released and randomly out of nowhere it was announced he&#39;d be living in Las Vegas so the news agencies were there ready to report on the massacre. So I have a suspicion that OJ being released was an excuse so that the reporters could be in Vegas ready to be at the right place at the right time to report on this tragedy. How long ago did the burglaries take place?</p>

I was not at bellagio during the robbery but from friends I heard guests and employees were corralled into the back of the house basement immediately and everyone was in chaos inside the restaurant kitchens and hallways. </p>

<p>Same thing happened on Sunday at multiple outlets at aria, Mandalay Bay, New York New York, Luxor, and Excalibur. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interdepartmental coordination for these types of events happens at the command level not the individual officer level. The drilling will happen there. And it&#39;s not something that will get linked. </p>

<p>Cops work well together with cops from neighboring jurisdictions because they all train out of the same book. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve never been to Vegas but i could assimilate with their on the ground response even though I&#39;ve been away from Le and the military since 2011 because I have the same training (active shooter response that is currently used has been being trained by the fbi since like 2008) </p>

<p>There are already plans in place for this stuff </p>

<p>While our police aren&#39;t adequately trained for general policin use of force they are more than adequate at active shooter response. There isn&#39;t a city in this country without a plan. Even small towns have plans in a filing cabinet. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you look into occult numerology there are some interesting things with this <em>alleged</em> shooter.</p>

<p>He is 64 years old right? Found dead on the 32nd floor? I know this will seem insignificant to most of you, but there is also some number play going on here.</p>

<p>23 is a significant occult number, and as we know 2/3 = 0.666 repeating.</p>

<p>So we have a 64 year old man on the 32nd floor:</p>

<p>64 can also be represented as (32+32) or the number 46 (reversal). (32 and 32 are two 23s - reversal). </p>

<p>32 can be represented as 23 (reversal), so another 23 (0.6666). 46 is also two 23s.</p>

<p>Probably important to note that the 32nd degree is the 2nd highest free mason degree next to 33rd. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not trying to make any claims here, I just think the numbers are intriguing. </p>

<p>The police stood outside the door of the man&#39;s hotel room for approximately 1 hour and 33 minutes. It took them 56 minutes to get the door breached. After the door was breached it took 37 minutes for the perpetrator to be announced dead.  I don&#39;t know about the timeline and how long it would usually take to get inside a hotel room in which a guy just shot 200-500 people but I believe that the length of time they just stood outside is sketchy</p>

The difference now is, I know what it&#39;s like to be traumatized by something that inhumane while the rest of the world says it didn&#39;t even happen. And it&#39;s a terrible feeling to go through something horrible just to be told you&#39;re lying or part of the plan.</p>

<p>The government being involved, ulterior motives regarding gun laws, a giant cover-up or conspiracy... I don&#39;t know. But whether or not this was just a very disturbed man, or something way shadier, people got killed. They got killed. They got fucking killed. We should be discussing this and trying to make some sense of what happened, but we have to do it with some sensitivity and respect.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I&#39;m glad to hear you&#39;re okay and that those close to you are okay. First off this is just theory. I&#39;m more interested at looking at things and wondering if there&#39;s connections. I&#39;m in no way saying that there were ulterior motives or that MSM is lying. I&#39;m saying that there are many things that the MSM isn&#39;t pointing out that has surfaced. Lastly, I know for 100% sure that the shooting actually happened. There&#39;s no doubt about that. And if somebody tries to tell me no one died I would instantly tell them they&#39;re an idiot. I just think that it&#39;s important that you have people out there like me and many others that will question the MSM and government on their honesty. I don&#39;t think there&#39;s too many people that would say no shots were fired and nobody died. And with Sandy Hook I think a large consensus was that there&#39;s sketchy instances that need to be looked into. Same with Vegas. Once again I&#39;m glad to hear you&#39;re okay and I&#39;m glad those you love are okay too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right on. Yeah, after Sunday night, I have to reevaluate my views about the other massacres.
I think the one major barrier we have in trying to get the facts is because of the chaos. Say, like the guns... The news first said there were ten guns in the hotel room the shooter was in. Then I heard another number I can&#39;t remember, and then just a little while ago, it was 48. How do you even manage to pack and conceal that many firearms? Especially considering we&#39;re not talking about little hand guns. These were assault rifles (so the news said at least one time I know of). I&#39;m very illiterate with guns, but I&#39;m pretty sure the rifles are significantly larger than a pistol. And not one hotel attendant thought it strange that this guy was carrying these multiple totes to the room when he was only going to stay a few more days.Then there were several people around us saying there was another shooter.
I could go on, but my point is just, when chaos breaks out, no, nobody is keeping a record. And how can you when you&#39;ve got 500 people with bullets lodged into their bodies while everyone else is running around screaming like a bunch of banshees? Of course information is going to be flawed. How could it not be?</p>

<p>No, this isn&#39;t about that. This is Russia deliberately attacking against our societies and causing chaos and mayhem. </p>
