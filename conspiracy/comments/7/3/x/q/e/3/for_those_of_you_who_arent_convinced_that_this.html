        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>At 42 seconds in <a href="https://youtu.be/B7ixInjs0C4">this video</a>, if you look and listen closely you can see and hear a projectile ricochet off the ground and hit a clear plastic cup, causing it to spin. Let me just say that I am well aware of the governments ability and willingness to stage a mass shooting. I personally do not believe the sandy hook, or some other stories like these, but I have no doubt that this Las Vegas shooting did actually take place. Though I will not be convinced it was the man accused of the shooting or that it was only one shooter until I can see ample evidence of that.       </p>

<p>If you have trouble seeing the ricochet and cup spin in the video, slow it down. It is easy to see once you know where to look. And again, it happens almost exactly at 42 seconds in the video that I linked.      </p>

<p>EDIT: <a href="https://youtu.be/GRDY4mq6_PU">For those of you having trouble seeing it</a> watch in fullscreen on a monitor, not cellphone. Otherwise it might be too small to see.      </p>

<p>EDIT 2: Just found another bullet ricocheting in another area from another video...think someone probably caught a bullet with this one. NSFW tag added to post. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WBebEuOyDg">Read Description</a> Trajectory seems to be coming from the Luxor, not the Mandalay bay on this video.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the synchronicity of the audio and video, and the puff of white make it pretty clear that what we saw was a high velocity projectile impacting the ground and then the cup...or at least some type of mini explosion (im thinking like those little white popper things you get on the 4th of july and whatnot). As one commenter stated, I do find it odd that we onlyl see one puff in the video...you would think with that rate of fire, we would see clusters of impacts. But to be fair, the distance was pretty far, and the shooter could have been spraying from one direction to another.</p>
