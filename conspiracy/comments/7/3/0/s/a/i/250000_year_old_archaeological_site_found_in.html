        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hueyatlaco">Hueyatlaco</a> site in Mexico shows evidence of human activity 250,000 years ago. However, this evidence has been forgotten because it contradicts the established narrative. </p>

<p>Here is what a paper in 1981 had to say:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The evidence outlined here consistently indicates that the Hueyatlaco site is about 250,000 yr. old. We who have worked on geological aspects of the Valsequillo area are painfully aware that so great an age poses an archeological dilemma [...] In our view, the results reported here widen the window of time in which serious investigation of the age of Man in the New World would be warranted. We continue to cast a critical eye on all the data, including our own.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s basically it. A &quot;we&#39;ll keep that in mind&quot;. They still teach that humans never entered the Americas before 15k years ago.</p>

<p><a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2017/04/mastodons-americas-peopling-migrations-archaeology-science/">Here</a> researchers found evidence of human activity in California 130,000 years ago. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/2005/11/30_fp.shtml">Here also</a> we also see human footprints dated to 1 million years ago in Mexico. Nobody disputed they were human foot prints until after they were dated. Dishonest huh? </p>

<p>I quote:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;You&#39;re really only left with two possibilities,&quot; Renne said. &quot;One is that they are really old hominids - shockingly old - or they&#39;re not footprints.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The evidence Paul has produced by dating basically means that this argument is over, unless indisputable footprints can be found sealed within the ash.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>See the double standards here? They accept other foot prints of equal quality when the dates are as expected. </p>

<p>Then, their strongest argument:</p>

<blockquote>
<p> &quot;If they were hot, why would anybody be walking on them?&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is another thing we always see whenever controversial finds are found:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Bournemouth, was quoted on a Royal Society Web site as saying, &quot;Accounting for the origin of these footprints would require a complete rethink on the timing, route and origin of the first colonization of the Americas.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Maybe it&#39;s time for a rethink?</p>

<p>Why are scientists so hesitant to change their theories?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course, but you have to admit thqt it is quite romantic to believe Scientists research for the betterment of their field but like with all other jobs, eventually it turns into a paycheck for most. In science, specifically, being well known and published ultimately leads to preference on results that appease the status quo rather than shattering it. Scientist are incredible people but most succumb to personal agendas like most of us do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For example, we all know that humans have an impact on Climate change but thanks to resources like this sub, we know this data has been heavily doctored to push the narrative that humans are solely responsible for this.

<p>Do humans impact climate change? Sure, are we solely responsible or does the planet have a track record of change? Yes, but you won&#39;t hear that from a scientist. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The planet is actually getting warmer. That&#39;s a problem we need to solve real fuckin&#39; quick or we&#39;re quite literally toast. Reducing CO2 emissions is a great start, because we know that they do have an impact, a sizeable one, to the effect that reducing them substantially will at least buy us some time. The thing about the climate change issue that really pisses me off, is that people will acknowledge that humans must be contributing to the planet getting warmer-even the most adamant deniers will indeed acknowledge that-yet there is no call to action to do what we can do reduce the heating of the planet. It seems like many people that are skeptical of and deny climate change are content with just letting the planet get warmer because there&#39;s nothing we can do, a sentiment I don&#39;t share as a skeptic of the official climate change narrative.  Something about their belief in revelations and the end times I guess.</p>

<p>Think about how much time, energy, and resources are devoted to warfare, or taken by corruption and bloat. The lacking emphasis placed on learning science. I imagine when doom is imminent that we will find a solution somehow. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Solvable is not how I’m thinking.
Our situation is a predicament. We more or less have to bring Armageddon upon ourselves in an unlikely gamble to save the biosphere.
We have built our numbers to 7.5B with fossil fuels, we’re hopelessly addicted and totally reliant upon them.
Renewables are an extension of our FF addiction, they cannot be built or maintained without FF’s. </p>

<p>Because fossil fuels are finite, so too are renewables, but what renewables do do is allow us to use FF’s for longer, they are extending the burn. That is what is buying us time. Whether or not in that extra time, some miracle can be discovered, is some reason to hope but not just hope and do nothing. Certainly a very small fraction of 7.5B will make it through the coming bottleneck.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>True. There will be a point when battery and electric vehicle technology advances enough to replace FF burning and greenhouse gas emissions 100%, but I&#39;m not entirely optimistic.

<p>It&#39;s going to take major social/political reform to fix this, and we can only hope it happens. But we can do what we can to speed it along. </p>

<p>Wouldn&#39;t be scorching, but okay. It&#39;d be slightly warmer in some parts of the world, but also much much wetter overall. XD alarmists paint this hilarious picture of what our world looks like once GHG have exacted their toll on man.</p>

<p>Not yet anyhow, but the there are two important advantages of renewables that make them worse utilizing in place of FFs.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Over the lifespan of the technology, most renewables will use far less FFs for the same amount of energy captured.</p></li>
<li><p>When renewable energy technology has reached the end of its lifespan, the FFs contained within are <em>controlled</em>. They aren&#39;t being released into the atmosphere where we can&#39;t manage them presently.</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, AGAIN, that&#39;s opinion. I&#39;m done going around with you, you clearly are seeking a fantasy explanation at all rational cost.</p>

<p>Actually, I&#39;ve been loathe to bring this up but since this is my last post I will - the tools themselves were from non-local materials and it&#39;s possibly they were planted there by people working on the initial excavation, before any of these geologists were even on the scene. And this explains them not &quot;fitting&quot; in the strata. So most reasonable scientists would stop reading, right there, having heard the ludicrous date proposed by the study, after seeking out the circumstances of the tools&#39; first appearance.</p>

<p>Anyway take care. I&#39;ve just read back on your comments and aside from the supernatural stuff it appears we&#39;re in agreement about the real-world conspiracies,t eg the Ukrainian coup and the Syrian &quot;civil&quot; war and probably more I&#39;d wager if I looked back further. Cheers.</p>

<p>The initial study DID conclusively date. What makes you think they didn&#39;t? Even if you claim they didn&#39;t, several modern tests that came after that time did date correctly. </p>

<p>All the dating methodologies show a consistent dating of 250,000 years ago. <strong>4 different methods were done to arrive at that date</strong>.</p>

<p>I quote:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The paper reported the results of four sophisticated, independent tests: uranium-thorium dating, fission track dating, tephra hydration dating and the studying of mineral weathering to determine the date of the artifacts. These tests, among other data, validated a date of 250,000ypb for the Hueyatlaco artifacts. They wrote:</p>

<p>The evidence outlined here consistently indicates that the Hueyatlaco site is about 250,000 yr. old. We who have worked on geological aspects of the Valsequillo area are painfully aware that so great an age poses an archeological dilemma [...] In our view, the results reported here widen the window of time in which serious investigation of the age of Man in the New World would be warranted. We continue to cast a critical eye on all the data, including our own.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also read this from other scientists about the initial team:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and attested to the integrity of the excavations and the professionalism of the group&#39;s methodology.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The site IS dated to 250,000 and it is proven by the dating. And you have  is argument to the contrary. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>No one said it did</p>

<p>What about Steen-McIntyre, Fryxell and Malde?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The evidence outlined here consistently indicates that the Hueyatlaco site is about 250,000 yr. old. We who have worked on geological aspects of the Valsequillo area are painfully aware that so great an age poses an archeological dilemma [...] In our view, the results reported here widen the window of time in which serious investigation of the age of Man in the New World would be warranted. We continue to cast a critical eye on all the data, including our own.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Do you dispute this?</p>

<p>Also another researcher:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Biostratigraphic researcher <strong>Sam VanLandingham</strong> has published two peer-reviewed analyses that <strong>confirm the earlier findings of ca. 250,000ybp for the tool-bearing strata at Heyatlaco.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also another one:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In 2008 during a Geological Society of America conference, <strong>Joseph Liddicoat</strong> presented paleomagnetic research into the volcanic ash at Hueyatlaco. The ash was dated to sometime after the Brunhes–Matuyama reversal, ca. 780k ybp </p>

<p>scientists claiming the artifacts themselves are that old still haven&#39;t proven it</p>

<p>What do you mean by proof? They have dated the artifacts just like any other archaeological or paleontological find that is normally accepted as proof. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>they were only relying on their assessment of the geologic matter in order to make </p>

<p>Just like most other stratigraphic evidence to make similar claims....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a spectrum of rationality, this is not even on the spectrum. fwiw I don&#39;t agree with most of the accepted timelines, and most prehistorical anthropological theory is still in the hypothetical phase as well. Most scientists would probably disagree with me. But this million year old civilization shit is for entertainment purposes only, and it used to be regarded correctly back when most of it was first conceived, as fiction. That people really think it&#39;s all &quot;possible&quot; is just another sign of the new idiocracy. As the common man becomes more removed from science and exploration, his cultural preference for myth returns, aided by snake oil salesmen like Hancock and the clowns who appear on the &quot;History&quot; channel. We might as well call it the new dark ages.  Or perhaps the common man is just reverting back to his natural state, having had a brief glimpse into non-essential education.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Overall, he relies on myth and apocrypha to craft his theories. He literally pulls stuff from fiction. You can&#39;t even argue with a person like that. I mean, he&#39;s doing it all for money. He requires his audience to have a dearth of basic knowledge. It&#39;s all non-sensical. I actually view it as performance art. He&#39;s an immensely dedicated producer, I&#39;ll give him that, even though most of his material is pulled from old fiction it&#39;s also clear that he&#39;s an intelligent person.  The way he compiles it is very compelling to a certain gullible slice of humanity. And this really, imo, paints him as a charlatan. He knows better. And it&#39;s not like we&#39;ve scratched the surface of prehistorical man - instead of seeking reality, he&#39;s chosen  performance art, on a mission of stale rehashing of old hoaxes over a real purpose.

Reducing CO2 emissions is a great start, because we know that they do have an impact, a sizeable one, to the effect that reducing them substantially will at least buy us some time. The thing about the climate change issue that really pisses me off, is that people will acknowledge that humans must be contributing to the planet getting warmer-even the most adamant deniers will indeed acknowledge that-yet there is no call to action to do what we can do reduce the heating of the planet. It seems like many people that are skeptical of and deny climate change are content with just letting the planet get warmer because there&#39;s nothing we can do, a sentiment I don&#39;t share as a skeptic of the official climate change narrative.

<p>Right but if you don&#39;t have a model to support the existence of people 20,000 years ago, you just throw that evidence out-regard it as an outlier and assume it isn&#39;t what it looks like, because if you don&#39;t, you&#39;ll have to replace the existing theory and all its models with something new, which you have no evidence for (because it has been thrown out every time this happens instead of used to create another theory).</p>

<p>Models are made based on actual observations, yes, but the number of actual observations that suggests the present young human working model far exceeds the older human model, so every time new evidence comes around it gets disregarded.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Yes but if 90% of the evidence and existing models you find contradicts that older model, you won&#39;t gain any support. You&#39;ll be ostracized by your peers.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not like there isn&#39;t data to support a younger human civilization now. That&#39;s not the point. The obstacle anthropologists face is connecting all of their data in some way so as to acknowledge discarded data points (connecting the older artifacts to the newer ones). No one will do that because they will be ostracized and won&#39;t get funding to do it.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Michael Cremo in his book <em>Forbidden Archaeology</em> shows that from the beginning, shortly after Darwin published <em>On the Origin of Species</em>, scientists had an inherent belief that humans were a very recent species. He documents that scientists of that time period discredited archaic finds by saying things like how it&#39;s &quot;impossible&quot; for humans to be that old. </p>

<p>Cremo also shows that before, and shortly after, Darwin&#39;s publication, scientists were discovering several artifacts showing human activity going back to even hundreds of millions of years ago. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right but there was an extreme absence of data-not like the volumes of anthropological data we presently have, so if you are presented with very little data for either worldview, and you have to make a judgment call, you&#39;re going to go with what seems to be informed by other, tangential or non scientific information, which is what young human theory seemed at the time. I&#39;m not trying to defend it, I&#39;m just articulating that anthropologists at the time were faced with a shit situation and tried to make the best of it. Soon after they were presented with heaping piles of evidence that supported their decision, which was good.</p>
