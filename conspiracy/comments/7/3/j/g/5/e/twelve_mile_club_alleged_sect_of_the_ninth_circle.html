        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Vancouver was ranked by UNESCO as one 3 global trafficking hubs back in 1998. Not much was done about it.</p>

<p>It appears there is a sect of the Ninth Circle satanic sacrifice cult called the Twelve Mile Club, which moors private yachts in West Vancouver and then takes children 12 miles out to sea (international waters) for abuse, murder and disposal. </p>

<p>Often the children are Native, taken from the streets of Vancouver, or from reservations.</p>

<p>Many people have given testimony on this, and it reaches deep into the Catholic church and the government. <a href="http://theshamecampaign.com/2014/11/10/canadian-inquiry-reveals-possible-west-coast-wing-of-ninth-circle-sacrificial-cult-twelve-mile-club-involves-top-judges-clergy-and-politicians/">article here</a></p>

<p><a href="http://porkupineblog.blogspot.ca/2009/12/child-trafficking-and-pedophilia-in.html">Here is a timeline</a> of related events in BC, including details on court complicity, media bans, and cooperation from some Native Chiefs themselves.</p>

<p>Details of government/Ninth Circle involvement <a href="http://itccs.org/2014/11/04/ottawa-false-flag-killings-covered-huge-scandal-itccs-breaking-news-november-4/">here</a></p>

<p><a href="http://itccs.org/category/twelve-mile-club/">12 mile club</a></p>

<p>There was some talk about this situation many years ago, and I think ITCCS was actually able to get a bunch of Ninth Circle members arrested, but I don&#39;t know the details... Also I&#39;m wondering if anyone&#39;s able to find a mirror to the missing video that&#39;s linked in a few of those articles.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Native American communities in Canada have faced atrocities that they openly speak about. Children being taken off never to be seen again, lots of church molestations, secret society shenanigans, and overall using them as cattle. It deserves a lot more attention than it gets. Human trafficking is quite an epidemic up there from what I hear from Canadians online.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I used to work with a native from the reservation in Saskatoon Canada and he was telling me how a lot of his family/friends were receiving settlements from the boarding schools because of sexual abuse and molestation. It was a huge huge problem and many boarding schools got shut down. They were all government run and the government had to pay out millions of dollars for all these sex abuse cases. That was just his family. It was very very wide spread and many natives faced abuse and rape and molestation. It really freaked me out how systematic and wide spread it was and it really didn&#39;t seem to surprise him much, just another day.  Native Americans have faced a lot of abuse</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lived in a particularly bad city in BC my whole life until a year ago. The racism towards natives from people outside of my age group (high school) is widespread and if not accepted, pretty open. There&#39;s a belief that they think white people owe them everything, that they don&#39;t like us, etc. There are also quite a few programs (financial aid, schooling) that actually do prioritize them, which if beneficial doesn&#39;t help their cases, especially when there&#39;s a seemingly disproportionate amount of lower income families. Definitely a detachment between the two, but it doesn&#39;t matter in school. Same thing here in Alberta, just with fillipinos. </p>
