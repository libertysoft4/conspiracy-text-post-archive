    <div class="md"><p>Just FYI the constitution was designed to grow and change . Yeah gun rights were written by in but the founding fathers expected progress and change. Obviously even in 1700s we knew society would invent and progress. I’m not saying take away guns but Jesus , think of what the founding fathers would have written maybe if they knew you could fire a thousand rounds a minute and be a one man army ?</p>

<p>Just calm the fuck down. No ones saying take t away but fuck man, if you wanna join the army you gotta take a personality test right ?</p>

<p>Maybe do that shit ? Sure it would catch everyone but it could easily catch some. It’s like a car man, you wanna drive on the road ? Maybe take a gun test showing you know safety. I bet you’d have a ton of red neck fathers in the south loving that shit ; imagine, raising your kid on guns, practicing with them, then the big day comes they take their gun license , pass their mental state and every 5 years have to take the test again ( only if they wanna renew it )</p>

<p>I’m just saying I could see it as a bonding thing for family’s .</p>

<p>Driving is a privilege right ? Well maybe make gun owning a right that requires certain goals be met and as an American if you’re fit , boom you’re allowed. But Jesus man there does need to be a change. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t have to imagine what they think they wrote it down in the founders documents and notes stating clearly that USA citizens will have &quot;of like kind weapons&quot; of that of the military and each citizen will have a rifle and ammo &quot;of like kind&quot; when you attack this you attack USA</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This universal hatred of the USA that you are alleging is artifically manufactured propaganda and not representative of factual reality in that many countries and peoples love the USA deeply as much as or more than even their own countries even in spite of them being constantly bombarded just like the people inside the USA are with anti-USA hatred.  The hate-USA narrative is a conspiracy as is the suppression of news to the USA of countries or people outside of the USA who have or would express their love and support for USA and what it stands for.  The anti-USA machine is cranking overtime, this event proves it even more.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do agree that there is propaganda out there to make people hate the USA and I think the amount of movies and series that feature the USA have created a generation of &quot;America fans&quot; that wish life was like the TV and know too much about the US and know English (Im one of them), these people will always act as ambassadors for the USA, there is love for the USA out there, but they are surrounded by people who have been trained by the globalist left to hate capitalism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh I am in the USA but in no way am I proud of that. I hold so much hate for this evil country. We are bullies. Not to mention greedy, fat, selfish, careless, fucking idiots. Our government kills our own people all the time and we just watch we don&#39;t care. They divide us and we let them. They spend money on military that should be spent on healthcare and education. We kill countless people in other countries. We elected a god damn television star who did nothing to get where he is. He was born rich and stayed rich. We kill and we consume and we have no respect for anyone or anything. We as a country are fucking terrible. I am in no way proud to be an American. Maybe someday when things change when our water and our air isn&#39;t poisoned. When every color, sex, sexual orientation, religion can accepted each other and not kill each other. Maybe when our police stop killing people. Maybe when our government stops blaming their agendas on made up terrorist. Maybe when we stop fighting pointless wars. Maybe when we stop wasting money, maybe when our homeless have respect and help. Maybe when healthcare and mental health and education are taken seriously. Maybe when poor families aren&#39;t shoved on the back burners and succumbed to drugs, prison, or just a personal everyday hell. Maybe when the rich start giving a fuck about anything but themselves. You see though none of that will ever happen. The last thing I give a flying fuck about is if other countries care that an American person (government) shot a bunch of people. Bad shit happens every fucking day and it just keeps getting worse. We can&#39;t expect all the other countries to stop and give a fuck about 58 dead people when they have acid attacks, bombs, on purpose accidents killing people, our soldiers killing their people. So yes what a hateful and selfish post. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Two out of three buddy! I am not anti USA. I am more anti government. The USA is what it is we aren&#39;t the only shitty country in fact we may not even be the shittiest. However we are terrible and no one really gives a fuck and that&#39;s the problem. I am a girl and a young one and I work a good job and I pay my taxes, and I stand when they sing the anthem, and I feel for our military, I have many family members who were in it and are reallllll fucked up because of it, but the GOVERNMENT (who I am really against) doesn&#39;t help and doesn&#39;t care. I support the right to have guns, and I support the right to say what the fuck you want when you want to, and I support the amendment that says if the government is shit we as a people should abolish it. However we as a people are so brainwashed we just sit and watch tv and eat food and browse the web and consume consume consume. You are apart of the problem so proud of your country (a stolen country) but why? Why are you so proud? What is there to be proud of? You are so concerned with other countries yet you can&#39;t see all the problems with your own beloved country .... </p>
