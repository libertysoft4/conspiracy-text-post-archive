<p>I’ve been listening to the scanner since this began, first reports were 2-3 shooters from multiple floors of the Mandalay Bay hotel. The Tropicana and Ali Baba have also been mentioned as possible locations, but not confirmed. </p>

<p><em>Edit</em> - <a href="http://imgur.com/a/Om8We">Ad for crisis actors in Vegas placed over a month ago</a></p>

<p><em>Edit 2</em> - Report of shots fired in New York New York now. </p>

<p><em>Edit 3</em> - Report of black car in parking garage with wires hanging out. </p>

<p><em>Edit 4</em> - MSNBC and LVPD (on the scanner) confirming at least 2 shooters. </p>

<p><em>Edit 5</em> - “Multiple subjects down at NYNY” - LVPD on scanner. </p>

<p><em>Edit 6</em> - Confirmed incident at NYNY, and just confirmed active shooter at The Tropicana.</p>

<p><em>Edit 7</em> - Suspect down, floor 32 Mandalay Bay, room 135. </p>

<p><em>Edit 8</em> - No shots fired at The Tropicana, that was a false alarm. </p>

<p><em>Edit 9</em> - No shots fired at NYNY. Also a false alarm. Kinda feels like these guys were calling in false calls as diversions. </p>

<p><em>Edit 10</em> - Possible shots fired at the Caesar and Bellagio. What the fuck? </p>

<p><em>Edit 11</em> - Suspects targeted people at an outdoor country concert (Jason Aldean). </p>

<p><em>Edit 12</em> - No shots fired at Bellagio but it just went into lockdown. </p>

<p><em>Edit 13</em> - Looks like the remaining active shooter is at The Flamingo. </p>

<p><em>Edit 14</em> - <a href="https://twitter.com/SethKing85/status/914730889468289024">Video</a></p>

<p><em>Edit 15</em> - Male walking into The Bellagio with a rifle. </p>

<p><em>Edit 17</em> - Flights in and out of McCarron have been halted. </p>

<p><em>Edit 18</em> - Loose confirmation of Audi car bomb in a parking garage. </p>

<p><em>Edit 19</em> - Shot fired at Bellagio. Automatic fire could be heard on the scanner. </p>

<p><em>Edit 20</em> - Audi with carbomb was left by 4 males. </p>

<p><em>Edit 24</em> - MSNBC now saying on air “no more shooters involved.” However eyewitness accounts claim multiple. Let the fuckery begin. </p>

<p><em>Edit 25</em> - <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BZvKefmHvKU/?taken-at=560872463">More video</a></p>

<p><em>Edit 27</em> - “Can you please tell media to back off, we don’t have all suspects accounted for.” </p>

<p><em>Edit 28</em> - MSM continues to push the “no more shooters” narrative. Meanwhile, LVPD keep saying they have not apprehended all suspects. </p>

<p><em>Edit 29</em> - This will be my last edit as it is 4:30am and I’m fairly tired. LVPD Sheriff says only one shooter, and thus the lone shooter narrative (he even used the phrase lone wolf)  for this tragedy has been born. And of course the shooter is dead. I think the wise among us realize what has happened here. </p>

<p><em>Edit 30</em> - Okay, this is my last edit. <a href="https://twitter.com/RyanMcKinnell/status/914755192444272640">Link to eyewitness describing woman screaming “you’re all going to die” before concert.</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d suspect some kind of break-in is also going on with this event too, given there are way too many juicy targets in that regard. Multiple teams in this instance. Two or three are causing chaos to keep the police busy, and some other team is blowing into vaults. Might not even be stealing bulk cash, but transaction records and various ledgers which are likely just as important for big casinos these days.</p>

<p>However if that guess is right, I&#39;m not sure if the unseen group is going to make the news like the ones doing all the random shooting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There has been prior precedent for this kind of thing before. An attack for terror alone can be anywhere, but attacking a place where all the money tends to be concentrated tends to have a dual motive. And casinos are super-secretive about their financial dealings, it&#39;s just how they operate. I&#39;m going to stick with my hunch that there&#39;s more to this crime than what&#39;s in the news.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not really. First of all, whomever was firing was not trained properly to use that weapon. He was holding the trigger down and emptying the magazine in one pull, which renders an automatic kind of useless at the range he was allegedly firing <em>(hundreds of meters to over 1000m likelyt)</em> To me it sounded like an AK platform, probably firing from drum magazines - they&#39;re kind of a pain in the ass to reload especially if you&#39;re in a hurry.</p>

<p>Believe it or not had he been firing a semi-automatic weapon it could have been more deadly. Automatic 7.62 at that range, and with no proper control of the weapon will just send rounds tumbling into the distance off target.</p>

<p>The shooter had the high ground,which every military in the world seeks out for its tactical advantages. Especially when conducting an ambush into a target rich enviroment,,which is basicly what this was.
Of course, with aimed fire, it might be difficult to hit a specific target,but that wasnt the case here. All he had to do was point his weapon down toward the crowd,then spray and pray.</p>

<p>Not really. You can&#39;t legally purchase or operate a &#39;machine gun&#39; manufactured after 1986, so everything 1986 and prior can be purchased with an extensive ATF process and &#39;tax stamp&#39;. They are limited stock, so they costs thousands of dollars - anyone that buys a weapon like that is not using it to go on a killing spree, they&#39;re for hobbyists. This was either an illegal weapon, stolen, or illegally tampered with to make a particular semi-auto an &#39;automatic&#39; - which a lot of people do, but the weapon isn&#39;t safe or reliable if you do that.</p>

While yes, most of Spec Ops soldiers use semi automatic fire for almost all situations, full auto fire it&#39;s also very used in Spec Ops: Supressing enemies especially if they are a big group, CQC when cleaning rooms/buildings, etc...

    <div class="md"><p>Alex Jones said his sources said he had just converted to Islam and local law enforcement was already aware of him. Alex actually has good sources but youre probably too closed minded to even consider that. </p>

<p>Anyway ANTIFA was fucking threatening to kill people this fall so it seems likely it was them. Although obviously it could have been other things. </p>

<p>A huge fucking problem honestly is that the Media and politicians use these kinds of things as a way to gain control. If only they would just be rational and outdoor concert venues would just develop better security practices. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>He has good sources sometimes! Your using ad hominen now just because youve been radicalized by leftist media to not believing anything which comes from Alex Jones. He literally has good sources sometimes even if he is wrong about some other stuff. </p>

<p>Anyway even if you dont believe him this guy was obviously targeting conservatives. He was photographed at several radical leftist protests. <a href="https://imgur.com/a/NgvPH">https://imgur.com/a/NgvPH</a></p>

<p>Leftist media is constantly trying to hammer it into people that all Trump Supporters are racist and all white people are evil nazis. It&#39;s honestly not surprising that crazy people take it literally and then do horrible things. Use occam&#39;s razor. Its obvious why he targeted a country music concert. This guy&#39;s friends and family apparently said that he was against guns to. I think it&#39;s pretty obvious this guy was motivated politically at the very least. Maybe even ANTIFA had influence on him or radical islam. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a free country mother fucker. I&#39;m exercising my 1A to support the 2A, and hopefully warn people about radical leftism. Antifa really has fucking been threatening to get violent lately and there is nothing fucking wrong with Alex Jones. </p>

<p>Think how many people you know who would justify stealing from a rich person or a corporation. That is basically what leftism is all about, and it&#39;s a way bigger problem than racism. It&#39;s <em>richism</em>. Antifa has been justifying violence like crazy and saying they were gonna start ramping things up this fall. </p>

<p>Why the fuck do you think that guy shot up a country music concert? <em>Probably to kill conservatives.</em> You&#39;re just fucking mad because I&#39;m telling the truth and your delusional view of reality is caving in on itself. </p>

They could be anything, they could be for a TV commercial or even a legitimate training exercise. But we know they were posted beforehand, and I think that&#39;s why people weigh so heavily on them. We know the government has lied in the past to push agendas; we know about secret courts and illegal wiretapping, and we know about a current push to re-legalize said wiretapping.</p>

<p>Questioning everything, even in a sub for conspiracies, doesn&#39;t excuse the fact that this isn&#39;t questioning at all, just blatant declarations and assumptions without any critical scrutiny whatsoever, just jumping on things that seem to confirm <em>your</em> narrative. That you never come to the conclusion something <em>isn&#39;t</em> a conspiracy means that either <em>everything</em> is a conspiracy, or that perhaps you&#39;re not as astute as you think, and aren&#39;t critically analyzing the situation to determine it&#39;s veracity but are instead just looking for confirmations of your biases.</p>

<p>Seriously, when is the last time <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> threw in the towel and said, &quot;nope, not a conspiracy, just coincidence&quot;...? Shouldn&#39;t that be <em>fairly often</em> in the real world? If these conspiracies were so rampant and pervasive, don&#39;t you think <em>some</em> of them would be revealed as time goes on?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the answer is that it&#39;s far easier to collect evidence as if it were a false flag AS ITS HAPPENING rather than wait until its over, speculate, piece together something you find compelling, and then submit it to the world when everyone is, more or less, over it already.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;
No, its not great to question everything undoubtedly and to think way ahead of time that you&#39;re looking at a conspiracy, but, as was mentioned above, we live in a time when its probably a good idea if SOME people reacted that way and archived information as it was happening. Its seemingly already impossible to get anyone who isn&#39;t conspiracy-minded to give this any real consideration, anyway.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not immediately suspected of being fake per se, but its likewise not automatically accepted as fact.  </p>

<p>The goal is to be skeptically open-minded. The &quot;everything is a conspiracy&quot; mindset is as counter-productive as the &quot;nothing is a conspiracy&quot; mindset.</p>

<p>Its better to evaluate the evidence available and draw logical conclusions. At this point in time, its too early to tell. There are lots of social media posts, and reports about alternate shooter locations which are possibly due to fear, adrenaline and shot echoes.</p>

<p>Other than lurkers, this sub is a closed loop where we can discuss these sensitive topics without offending anyone and draw on our collective knowledge to suss through the info. </p>

<p>Be patient with the comments, as many are bots or trolls. The core group on this sub is quite logical and pragmatic, and don&#39;t take offense when someone makes a good counterpoint.</p>

<p>There are usually a handful of possibilities in any mass casualty event:</p>

<p>Totally true-really happened exactly as described (most crimes and murders)</p>

<p>Partially true-really happened, but info about how or why was altered or distorted for various reasons (directing political policy)</p>

<p>Not true-didn&#39;t happen at all (hoax)</p>

<p>Most events fall into the &quot;partially true&quot; category; and example would be an MCE where the shooter used a pistol and shotgun, but the media reports it was an assault rifle to garner support for increased gun control.</p>

<p>There are also other metrics for carefully analyzing these types of events, but this reply is running a little long.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It depends on the evidence presented vs the &quot;official story&quot; which isn&#39;t always the truth. Could this be what the story says? Absolutely. But the rational thing to do is to remain skeptical of what we&#39;re told and what comes out as well as conspiracy theories.</p>

<p>For me, this is where I&#39;m currently at:</p>

<p>No muzzle flashes on any of the videos that catch the building, particularly the floor they&#39;re saying this happened from. This could indicate weapons fire from another, possibly closer location. Could also indicate more than one shooter.</p>

<p>There&#39;s no break in fire- at least not one that indicates changing a 30 round magazine rather it indicates a belt fed machine gun. </p>

<p>Those are just a couple observations. As this unfolds, keep a close eye on the facts they give us and see if that holds against your own observations of common sense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Contract would be unenforceable in court. Only way that it would be possible to keep a huge amount of people quite is with a fuck ton of money, or by killing them. If your going to kill later them then there is no point in hiring actors and might as well just do a false flag. If the government is willing to fabricate a whole event like this or sandy hook they would just do a false flag and skip the high cost of paying a ton of people to be quite. Its not like we are talking about a government that has any true moral standard&#39;s, and the dead can&#39;t talk so there is no chance that they can expose it if they actually kill everyone.</p>

<p>Note the thread on r/news <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/news/comments/73qyvh/active_shooters_at_mandalay_bay_las_vegas/">got deleted</a> because <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/undelete/comments/73ri0j/mods_of_rnews_have_locked_the_main_thread_on_the/">people</a> were relaying what they were hearing on the police scanner, seemingly as it risked being useful to the shooters (that&#39;s what they&#39;re saying on r/undelete).

If criminals want to use publicly available information to help evade police, they&#39;re going to do it. They don&#39;t need to rely on amateur journalists reporting on social media, they can get the publicly available information from the same sources those people got it. &quot;Don&#39;t report on police radio because the bad guys might hear it&quot;? What? If they cared to know what police are doing and planned this in advance, why not just assume that they themselves are listening in on publicly available information like that? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They are referring to the attacks that happened in Paris where the news footage caused the terrorists to know where the police were and ended up with them getting shot. It also happened in eastern Canada when an RCMP officer was killed because people were tweeting locations of how cops were outside their house etc. </p>

<p>You can&#39;t always assume something is fishy, sometimes they just have genuine concern for the people on the force. Plus during a time of crises like This, they wouldn&#39;t know how many active shooters there were. If you listened to the scanner it sounded like the police were super confused so they may have thought there was multiple people armed.</p>

<p>Fenethylline is metabolized by the body to form two drugs, amphetamine (24.5% of oral dose) and theophylline (13.7% of oral dose), both of which are active stimulants. The physiological effects of fenethylline therefore seem to result from a combination of these two compounds, although this is not entirely clear.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think it&#39;s pretty equivalent; anyhow the pharmacological effects are utterly equivalent. True the wiki says Captagon <em>was</em> considered to have fewer side effects, although I don&#39;t really understand why as Captagon is metabolized as amphetamine.</p>

<p>How does one &quot;act like&quot; that via text? Show me where I did that or ignored your post? </p>

<p>Ahh yes another juicy tidbit that resides only in your head. </p>

<p>I observe you have zero evidence and comprehend you are desperate to prove you figured out a conspiracy while believing a fake 4chan prank. lol</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, there was a post here talking about a Crowds on Demand post directed at Phoenix (speculating it had something to do with Arpaio and his pardon). I saw that one too while trying to turn up the old topics, but there were even more talking about Las Vegas as well. Like this one: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6ujrmw/crowds_on_demand_in_las_vegas_prepare_for_a_riot/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6ujrmw/crowds_on_demand_in_las_vegas_prepare_for_a_riot/</a></p>

<p>There are others as well. Try a google search limited to reddit.com (since reddit&#39;s own search system is terrible), include the phrases &quot;Crowds on Demand&quot; along with terms like &quot;Vegas&quot; and &quot;conspiracy&quot; and you should be able to find more. A lot of the posts speculated this would be connected to the McGregor Mayweather from the end of August, so adding &quot;McGregor Mayweather&quot; with the other terms should get you some interesting results too. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Someone, or a group of people, from here need to respond to one of these Crowds on Demand ads, go along and see what happens. Would help to solve this mystery. Because if they&#39;re getting any old person to be involved in these types of events then you&#39;d think that&#39;d be dangerous for them as someone would speak out, even if they&#39;d had NDAs slapped on them, someone would have a conscience and say something, surely? Or at least, they&#39;d run the risk of someone saying something. So I think it&#39;d be v informative to have some people properly investigate this crisis actor thing. I&#39;d do it but I&#39;m not in the US.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the actual definition:</p>

<p><em>The contemporary term false flag describes covert operations that are designed to deceive in such a way that activities appear as though they are being carried out by entities, groups, or nations other than those who actually planned and executed them.</em> </p>

<p>And it&#39;s derived from pirate ships flying different flags to get in close before attacking. </p>

<p>Saying &quot;the action happens&quot; is such a cop out. You&#39;re now covering all the bases here. </p>

<p>Also then you&#39;re admitting the gunman did indeed fire from his hotel room and suicide prior to the police breach. A real false flag wouldn&#39;t go down like that. </p>

<p>No, there isn&#39;t. There is an IMDB page for Omar Mateen quoting articles from the Los Angeles post, New York times and the USA today. </p>

<p>Not an actor. Just because you think it is scripted based on pure speculation doesn&#39;t mean it is. Try looking up the definition of confirmation bias. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>While it&#39;s awesome that you haven&#39;t experienced that, it doesn&#39;t make what the previous poster said any less true. I&#39;ve lived in Vegas for almost ten years now. I don&#39;t often go to the Strip anymore, but I&#39;ve been approached by people saying similar things. There are legit nutjobs all over The Strip at any given time.</p>

<p>Normally they are religious crazies that say you&#39;re going to burn in hell. However I&#39;ve been told numerous times by random people that I would die that night. </p>

<p>Sometimes it comes from someone who&#39;s had too much to drink, others from someone who gambled a little too much and want to ruin your night. Sometimes it&#39;s a homeless person that you didn&#39;t give cash to. In all cases it&#39;s largely ignored.</p>

<p>It definitely happens. In this, specific, case though, the woman just happened to be right.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can confirm this.   Las Vegas might be the poor mental health capital of the USA, it both attracts and makes crazy people.  I worked there for a while last year in a capacity that required much contact with Las Vegas residents including homeless, my life was threatened on an almost daily basis.   I was also offered hooch on an almost daily basis,  not on the strip mind you but at public libraries, stores, and movie theaters by complete strangers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Gun control. CIA have been trying to get gun control restriction for so long, and this is how they intend to do it. </p>

<p>CIA has discovered a while back that mind control involves trauma. By orchestrating (through operatives) or sometimes LETTING these mass shootings happen, it inflicts a psychological shock wave into the minds of millions of people. And while they are in this state of shock and panic, the CIA and media will happily push the gun restriction narrative.</p>

<p>Search up Operation Northwoods, it was same style of mass-event tactic.</p>

<p>Look at it, it&#39;s working. So many people are posting things like &quot;ban guns&quot;, even thought it&#39;s totally against the constitution. The CIA wants to ban guns because it does not want any civillian guerillas or anti-governments to form in the future, in response to the criminal activities &amp; political interest of the US-CIA government.</p>

<p>Look at the pattern of CIA policies. It deliberately allows the formation of terror groups such as taliban, al qaeda, and ISIS. It funds both sides of the war in order to create mass chaos and subdue civillian population into psychological submission on reliance on government policies. As a justification, the US military will invade here and there, steal resources, possibly traffic humans or drugs. Oil stolen from Iraq, Opium stolem from Afghaistan. </p>

<p>Do politicians know about this? Of course. But they are all blackmailed puppets caught in compromised sex acts. They cannot do anything.</p>

<p>The CIA is utilitarian. It does not give a shit about morality. And if you must know, the earliest CIA researchers were Nazis who were brought in after World War 2 through Operation paper clip. They were the ones who invented Trauma based mind manipulation and mind control.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No cuz then republicans would then lose votes. What they want is the civillians to push republicans into making policy change, therefore the people wouldn&#39;t be able to blame politicians once they regret banning guns.</p>

<p>Pushing on republican into voting gun control wouldn&#39;t change the opinion for gun control by the masses. US citizens as a whole would only abandon gun control after repetitive traumatising events such as mass shootings.</p>

<p>Literally nothing about any of that says CIA. Try apply even the slightest bit of logic to your thinking and tri to have a little bit of respect for the people who just died.

    <div class="md"><p>This is what I was thinking as well too, especially since whenever these shootings happen everyone and anyone has some sort of &quot;useful information&quot; that ends up having little to no relevancy when the facts are sorted out. Sucks that so many people think of these kind of events as a false flag simply because they don&#39;t understand how much misinformation is spread by the public/officers in the initial hours after. </p>

<p>I remember during the San Bernardino shootings someone mentioned an explosion a few blocks away being a terrorist explosive device, but eventually it was discovered someones water heater exploded miles away. </p>

<p>Still, found this to be an interesting quote in the moment. </p>

<p>Definitely?  Do you have a single piece of proof that would let you use the D-word?  Because I&#39;ve read a shit ton on the subject and I definitely would not say they are definitely real.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think the government &quot;wouldn&#39;t dare&quot; use it as if it&#39;s such a heinous tactic.  It&#39;s just a horrible tactic that would get them caught immediately.  It requires you to ensure that everyone in the chain from victims to EMTs to doctors to funeral directors and morgue workers to all be involved in this fraud.  </p>

<p>False flags make sense and have occurred because they can involve only people who work for military and intelligence agencies to pull off.  Crisis actors hired off of Craigslist?  Emergency workers and hospital staff?  If you just think about it for a second you can see it would never work.</p>

<p><a href="http://crisiscast.com/">http://crisiscast.com/</a></p>

<p>A group like this, in combination with a coordinated and controlled media narrative, can easily be used to manipulate the public perception just as well as an actual incident.  </p>

<p>The problem is that after Sandy Hook and the countless investigations into the data, the public has demonstrated that simulated tragedies won&#39;t pass a legitimacy test without adequate documentation and logical consistencies.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes.  I am aware that crisis actors are real.  Like I said, I have read a shit ton on the subject.  A group like that could definitely not be used to manipulate public perception about an actual incident.  There are too many uncontrollable factors involved.</p>

<p>There is no proof that crisis actors have ever been used to simulate anything.  There&#39;s not even solid evidence.  The best you have is a grieving father who was caught laughing, which people do at funerals all the fucking time, and some people who have conflicting stories about a high stress day.</p>

<p>You guys never respond to the complicit emergency workers that would have to be involved because there is no answer to that.  It makes these things impossible.  It doesn&#39;t matter if the media was 100% government run, which it is not.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I know where I am.  I can&#39;t stop you from pushing these conspiracies but I do genuinely feel that they are hurting the community.  They are pushing our community to attack family members and giving the media ammunition to attack all conspiracy theories by lumping them in with these ridiculous ones.</p>

<p>I have looked into the crisis actor theories.  I&#39;ve looked at all the photo evidence of the Boston Bombing with the hoodied man and people supposedly dumping fake blood on each other.  I am not convinced.</p>

<p>Once again.  The amount of people necessarily involved in these conspiracies would be enormous.  You&#39;re talking about every cop on the scene, every EMT on the scene, every firefighter, every nurse, every doctor who saw these &quot;fake&quot; injured people.  Every single one of them would have either have to be fooled by the fake injuries or agree to go along with the conspiracy.  It is literally impossible.  It&#39;s not just implausible it could not have happened.  Not without a single person whistle blowing.  </p>

<p>You are wasting time and energy on a theory that could better be spent on something plausible.  Spending more time on Building 7 or JFK would be a better use of your time.  </p>

<p>10:32 they reached the 32 floor, and waiting for backup &quot;there&#39;s only two of us&quot;</p>

<p>14:30 officer says concert goers think there could have been three shooters.</p>

<p>16:00 mandalay bay 32 floor room # confirmed shots in room</p>

<p>17:00 Says shots fired at 29th floor as well as 32</p>

<p>17:20 coming out onto 32 floor</p>

<p>18:20 confirmed two shooters </p>

<p>19:30 officer advises to others to lock their vehicles citizens are trying to grab their shotguns </p>

<p>30:00 officer says shots have not been heard for about 15 minutes</p>

<p>32:00 team on 29th floor and 2 man team still in stairwell of 32 floor </p>

<p>33:50 clearing west wing of 32 floor </p>

<p>34:00 two strike teams moving into mandalay </p>

<p>34:38man in fatigues and a black bag seen getting into a white rv at a motel 6 near Tropicana.</p>

<p>Asked to repeat immediately after and it was.</p>

<p>35:50 civilian stole a patrol car (lol) 
36:40 being overrun by people trying to take patrol cars</p>

<p>39:10 20+ casualties in standing area of concert </p>

<p>42:00 need units at Tropicana for a &quot;possible&quot;</p>

<p>42:50 posted outside rv at Tropicana</p>

<p>48:20 zebra one on floor 31 holding at stairs leading to 32 </p>

<p>Aaaaaand end at 51 and some change without anything else going on. </p>

<p>Idk pretty interesting to hear but anticlimactic. Man in fatigues never got any closure so that&#39;s still a curious thread to pull on. </p>

<p>Isn&#39;t that how you execute an operation and blame it on a cut-out/fall guy?</p>

<p>Draw your cutout into a group, come up with a plan and then convince the cutout he&#39;s the guy they&#39;re invested in performing the operation.  Only the operators know the guy really can&#39;t be counted on, so there are backup/secondary operatives who guarantee the mission goes down.  The whole thing is planned so that the cutout is nearly guaranteed to get killed, thus making the &quot;lone gunman&quot; narrative impossible to question and the conspiracy&#39;s evidence dying with the cutout.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying this actually happened, but since this modus operandi can be applied after the fact to nearly every lone gunman shooting, it becomes kind of standard conspiracy theory logic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, so here is how it works because <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> has very strong opinions without knowing jackshit about any of this works.</p>

<p>People confuse SWAT and heavily armed officers for additional gunmen; in the campus stabbing a couple months ago or whenever that was, there were reports of multiple gunmen there too, even though it was just a dickhead with a knife, for the exact same reason.</p>

<p>Same reason why there were reports of gunmen in adjacent casinos; visibly armed cops clearing the area, civilians call them in.</p>

<p>When the police kill the <em>actual lone shooter</em> and suddenly people stop dying, and they tell the press, of course everyone reports on it simultaneously.</p>

<p>These &quot;strange things&quot; have reasonable explanations if you just think for a second. Every fucking time, <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> leaps from ignorance to grand fucking criminal conspiracy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The dots have been connected. The dude killed himself. You don&#39;t buy it? Will there ever be massacre where we accept the official FBI release? I blame J. Edgar Hoover, who as its founding director undermined its reliability by manipulating its trust to target and harass Americans, our celebrities and our most prominent civil rights advocate. No one has trusted them since. Comey? Out with him. No good. Sad. Mueller? This guy is breaking my balls!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The rate of fire is not consistent. And it&#39;s not winding up or down. It varies through. </p>

<p>Most likely this is due to the bump firing technique others have posted about. It involves removing your trigger hand front the gun and locking it in place, then using the recoil and reboot of the rifle off of your shoulder back in to the rigid trigger finger to fire another round. </p>

<p>I&#39;d never heard of it before last night. But in watching a video of it it makes sense to me that this is probably what you&#39;re hearing. The placement of the finger, the movement of the body as he fires and adjusts aim, could all create a change gun&#39;s recoil travel distance altering the rate of fire. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is sad, to me. There are countless &quot;players&quot; (not crisis actors) who play around with this world like it&#39;s their very own sandbox. Just about all of these schemes revolve around controlling, containing, limiting, and dumbing-down the masses. There are billions of dollars up-for-grabs for just about any agenda out there, and these players? They all run their schemes without a single care if you live or die - these are megalomaniac, psychopaths. There are true maniacs running this planet.</p>

<p>So yes, when something unusual happens - which has significant legal and financial implications, a rational first question is: was this just a crazy person? Or was this a game of one of those psychopaths of one of our psychopath owners. Not only is this a reasonable question, it&#39;s been documented history for as long as history has been kept. There are countless examples of false-flag attacks. These lethal &quot;games&quot; have been going on for a long time. And yes, getting back to &quot;crisis actors&quot; - they have been used in every one of these events, and are a required element. So, if you find a crisis actor, then you have a small bit of evidence that this may not be what it appears to be at face value.</p>

<p>Or, we can just go your route - sit in front of MSNBC, zone out, and take everything they say as fact... right?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do think the whole &quot;crisis actor&quot; bullshit in the conspiracy realm has been hand fed by the groups that benefit from making these places seem insane. </p>

<p>If we only had real conspiracy discussion here, it would be too easy to convert a lot of people and make them understand how much actual fuckery, documented, undeniable fuckery has went on and still goes on in this world on a large scale. </p>

<p>But if we mix in hologram planes, crisis actors, flat earth, etc, it discredits everything and makes most people want to keep far away so they are not branded a tinfoil hat nut. </p>

<p>I&#39;m sure 5% of the people here really believe the crisis actor nonsense, but since 95% of posts talk about it, I have to assume that there are other forces at work to insert this so heavily into every good thread. </p>

<p>Actors who are paid to act as though they have just experienced a shooting or something of the like. The Sandy Hook parents are actors, and not particularly good ones. They can be seen multiple times laughing and joking about the &quot;death&quot; of their child.</p>

<p>I find it curious that there are users in this thread actively trying to downplay the notion of crisis actors, which in the case of Sandy Hook has been proven beyond doubt. I&#39;m not at all saying that they have been used in this incident, merely pointing that users who want to attack people in regards to Sandy Hook theories may not be entirely trustworthy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>crisis actor was originally a term for people who worked with police, emergency services, military and security services organizations doing mock-up training drills of horrific situations like plane crashes and mass-shootings.</p>

<p>their job is to scream and cry and fake-bleed everywhere and generally act like anyone would in a high-intensity, crisis-type event, to allow the trainees the chance to get a feel for what actually responding to a school-shooting or something ACTUALLY feels like, irl, and to be able to perform more effectively when it happens, because they know what to expect.</p>

<p>its a legit job, and it has some crossover with the actual acting profession, in that it pays better than being an extra, and requires similar skills.</p>

<p>at some point, some bright spark came across a casting call, and decided that crisis actors were actually actors being hired for media-covered events that were fake (((false flag))) operations being pulled off by obama/elitists/jews in order to manipulate americans in one way or another </p>

<p>the usual target for these allegations are tied in with gun rights, so the sandy hook massacre right, was a &quot;false flag operation&quot; cynically engendering support for obama to destroy the second amendment, and all those distraught parents you saw crying on the news?? they were &quot;crisis actors&quot; taking money in order to destroy your right to bear arms as a proud American patriot. </p>

<p>well and good. <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/3bj4mj/sandy-hook-truthers-what-kind-of-person-calls-a-mass-shooting-a-hoax">well.. unless you&#39;re a grieving parent</a></p>

<p>the bit that gets me, however, is that the US government has NEVER been shy of killing people, either foreign or domestically. That they would even <em>consider</em> such an unwieldy and falsifiable method as inventing a bunch of children to fake-murder, forging birth certificates, staging a massacre at a school, getting the reporters involved, having a bunch of fake funerals, and then paying the <del>parents</del> crisis actors for the rest of their lives to keep up the pretense when they could just have some crazy fuckwit go in and ACTUALLY shoot up a school??</p>

<p>you know what governments care about more than gun laws? </p>

<p>MONEY.</p>

<p>You know whats cheaper in America than pensioning off a bunch of &quot;crisis actors&quot; to keeps up some facade??</p>

<p>BULLETS.</p>

The suspect shooter is dead but his companion Marylou Danley is still at large, according to Joseph Lombardo, the sheriff of the Las Vegas Metropolitan police department.</em></p>

<p>Almost everyone that takes the test says the male is clearly a libertarian, without considering the fact male farmers outnumber male librarians 10-1, so obviously, you&#39;d be more likely to find someone with that set of characteristics farming.</p>

<p>What you just did is the same. You didn&#39;t consider the other factors here.</p>

<p>This was a 65 year old, wealthy, retired white male. This demographic is overwhelmingly conservative, if we were going to take a shot in the dark, statistically, it&#39;s more likely he&#39;s a conservative.</p>

<p>this is the guy from that paper, should we copy paste some of it:</p>

<p>Stephen Gorham Paddock, Jr., 71, of Colorado Springs, passed away on January 24, 2013. Steve was born on July 28, 1941 in Cleveland, Ohio to the late Stephen and Helene (McNally) Paddock. After attending high school in Dallas, Texas, Steve graduated from Georgia Tech in Atlanta, Georgia. He worked in Aerospace engineering for over 40 years and retired from the Boeing Aerospace Company in 2002. On October 31, 1964, Steve married Louise &quot;Lou&quot; McConnell and together raised three children.</p>

<p>It took me under 10 seconds to debunk the claim the shooter worked at NASA. </p>

<p>As for the rest of this, I&#39;ll have to wait until more information surfaces. The pictures look like a different guy to me - the nose is shaped differently, but I wouldn&#39;t be comfortable forming an opinion until the police release more.</p>

<p>But I don&#39;t have high hopes for your image, considering it confused a well known aerospace engineer for a mass shooter.</p>

So that&#39;s all I&#39;m comment on in relation to the picture for the time being.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is obviously the work of mainstream liberal media brainwashing people into thinking that all trump supporters or conservatives are evil racist nazis that deserve violence! It&#39;s fucking obvious!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I see. So for example, is the right-wing media to blame for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_McVeigh">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_McVeigh</a> carrying out his bombing, they sure talked about how evil the government was pretty often, using your own logic.</p>

<p>Was this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Tucson_shooting">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Tucson_shooting</a> the work of the right-wing media fearmongering about gun control and brainwashing conservatives? To remain logically consistent, you&#39;d have to say yes.</p>

<p>Was this bomb plot <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2016/10/14/three-kansas-men-arrested-terrorism-plot/92094694/">https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2016/10/14/three-kansas-men-arrested-terrorism-plot/92094694/</a> because Trump spreading anti-immigrant fears and brainwashing his base? To remain consistent, you&#39;d have to say yes.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Furthermore there were reports that apparently he made Islamic comments lately and the police were aware of him. He was also photographed in dubai.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;d have to see credible proof of the Islamic comments thing. But this was an interesting little tactic you used here, did you think I wouldn&#39;t catch it?  After you made the dubious claim (he made Islamic comments) you said the police were aware of him, trying to make it seem as if the police said he had made Islamic comments. </p>

<p>Indeed, the police were aware of him, and here&#39;s what they said:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.masslive.com/news/index.ssf/2017/10/las_vegas_shooting_suspect_ste_1.html">http://www.masslive.com/news/index.ssf/2017/10/las_vegas_shooting_suspect_ste_1.html</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>As the death toll continues to rise, the FBI has disputed a claim by the Islamic State. </p>

<p>The shooter who took the lives of 58 people and injured more than 500 others during Las Vegas concert had no connection to an international terrorist group. </p>

<p>The Islamic State claimed hours after the massacre that the shooting suspect, 64-year-old Stephen Paddock, had converted to Islam several months ago.</p>

<p>FBI Special Agent in Charge Aaron Rouse told reporters Monday that such a claim was false. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So right here you&#39;ve revealed that you fell for literal ISIS propaganda, the FBI has already refuted.</p>

<p>As for your dubai claim. Lot&#39;s of people travel to dubai, millions yearly. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/284636/visitor-arrivals-in-dubai-from-international-destinations/">https://www.statista.com/statistics/284636/visitor-arrivals-in-dubai-from-international-destinations/</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>This statistic shows the number of international overnight visitors to Dubai from 2010 to 2016. In 2016, there were 14.87 million international overnight tourists to Dubai, up from 14.2 million in 2015.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So I&#39;m not sure how him going to dubai confirms this conspiracy.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Please. Do not be purposefully obtuse! The victims do not fucking deserve people ignoring what is going on. The liberal media is trying their hardest to radicalize and divide people.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Are you trying to use the victims of a mass shooting to push your agenda here? </p>

<p>Some conservative media has been bad at times but never has it got to the point which liberal media has recently. Literally all of them are calling Trump supporters and conservatives nazis and racists and even hinting at punching them in the face or telling people to end relationships with them.</p>

<p>They have been making people paranoid and targeting weak minded liberals. Liberals are much more often people with mental disorders or personality disorders. Conservatives are much more likely to be responsible or familiar with safe handling of firearms. </p>

<p>Im sure at some point there has been conservative media which was bad in the same way but that was probably some fringe thing. Fox news never tells people to go out and kill people. Meanwhile we have CNN and MSNBC comparing Trump supporters to nazis and saying they are all racists and fascists which need to be stopped. </p>

<p>Its no fucking surprise they pushed someone over the edge finally. Radical leftism appeals to people with mental disabilities and they know this. Regular leftism appeals to people who are disenfranchised so its obvious that the media has been trying to push people to do violent acts. You are fucking blind if you cannot see this. </p>

<p>And I just included what Alex Jones said because i thought others might find it interesting. You can choose to not believe the part about him being islamic if you want but I still think its a possibility.</p>

<p>Lastly. Youre being ignorant if you dont acknowledge the most obvious motive is shooting conservatives. Why would he pick a country music concert? Maybe it turns out to be something else later but you cannot deny that the simplest explanation would be that he wanted to killed conservatives, and probably white people at that.</p>

<p>How the fuck was he supposed to know that their were a bunch of hispanic people there? Average person usually associates country music with white people and conservatism. Also this was supposedly an even which had something to do with christians. So maybe that had something to do with it..</p>

<p>Again. If you havent noticed the constant race baiting and radicalization which liberal mainstream media has been broadcasting lately you are being obtuse and disingenuous.  </p>

<p>Again if you deny that the simplest motive is to kill conservatives because it was a country music concert you are being disingenuous. </p>

<p>There is an obvious motive staring you in the face yet youre trying as hard as you can to find something else to believe in because it hurts your ego to believe that liberals could do anything wrong ever.</p>

<p>Also just fucking google &quot;trump supporters racist&quot; or &quot;trump supporters nazis&quot; to see how the media is trying to signal to people that conservatives deserve violence. Its fucking obvious and you fucking know it. </p>

<p>Ignoring the historical illiteracy in this billboard, sure seems they&#39;re comparing Obama to Hitler.</p>

<p>And lets not forget the abortion clinic shooting that was tied to that false claim about selling baby parts:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fbi hasnt debunked anything. They have a public and a private face and Alex claimed to have had inside knowledge. I dont care if you believe it or not and I&#39;m not even sure if that part is true.</p>

<p>Even if the pictures of the guy in the pussy hat are not Paddock that does not disprove that this was probably a hate crime against country music  fans specifically, because they are perceived to be mostly white and conservative. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll concede that Conservative media sometimes goes to far, like with abortion, and that mainstream media in general is designed to subvert the general population. I&#39;ll also concede there might have been violent psychos that were inspired or motivated by conservative media. But <strong>currently</strong> liberal media is objectively more radicalizing. </p>

<p>No question about it. They are literally telling people that they are in a war with Russia and that we must overthrow our government, and it&#39;s remarkably similar to 2003 when both sides of the mainstream media convinced people to support overthrowing Iraq&#39;s government. This is incredibly radicalizing and many users on r/politics literally think any other opinions must be coming from a Putin agent. </p>

<p>Mainstream sources may not <em>explicitly</em> call for violence but they directly call or compare Trump, Trump supporters, white people, conservatives, libertarians, anyone calling for less immigration and anyone calling for more freedom and independence (like states rights) to fascists, nazis, KKK, racists, xenophobes. The understanding is that groups like Nazis or the KKK are &quot;crossing the line&quot; and therefore deserve violence (like a punch in the face) or their rights infringed upon such as free speech. </p>

<p>Keith Olberman literally just called the NRA a &quot;terrorist organizaiton&quot; even though they are nothing but a group of people who defend American&#39;s right to defend themselves. Ironic because he&#39;s using projection to deflect the obvious fact that the las vegas shooting was probably a terrorist hate crime against white conservatives. Olberman also defends terrorist by insinuating that immigration does not lead to increased terrorist attacks like in Europe. </p>

<p>Olberman&#39;s latest vid where he calls the NRA &quot;terrorists.&quot; He also calls Trump a nazi and a &quot;russian agent.&quot;

<p>They don&#39;t explicitly say go out and kill Trump supporters but they are constantly race baiting and telling people that Trump is a leader of nazis and white supremacists. A common line they say all the time is that &quot;not all trump supporters are white supremacists but all white supremacists are Trump supporters.&quot; Do you understand how this fucking radicalizes people, especially weak minded liberals that their only political opinion is they want handouts from the government? </p>

<p>It&#39;s easy to focus on the angry white men in paramilitary gear who looked like they were mobilizing for a race war in the Virginia college town. But it&#39;s the ordinary people -- the voters who elected a reality TV star with a record of making racially insensitive comments, the people who move out of the neighborhood when people of color move in, the family members who ignore a relative&#39;s anti-Semitism -- who give these type of men room to operate, they say.</p>

<p>You see how their telling people that Trump supporters are supporting nazism and white supremacy? They are literally trying their very hardest to radicalize people without explicitly stating that Trump supporters <em>are</em> nazis. </p>

<p>Literally hundreds of pieces about how Trump was dog whistling to racists by saying &quot;both sides.&quot; Do you understand how dangerous that is? They are calling people racists because they <em>didnt</em> say something. That means anyone who doesnt say the magic words is autmatically a racists. I personally lost a friend becuase I agreed that ANTIFA were violent. They are conditioning people to perceive people as racists just for calling out radical leftism or <em>not</em> condemning someone. Do you understand how dangerous that is? Now instead of &quot;nigger&quot; being the magic word which permits violence, simply not saying something will put you into the racist category.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>A group of hard-right extremists came to Berkeley to hold a rally in support of Trump. While they are, of course, claiming that they only resorted to violence in self-defense, it&#39;s clear from the social-media organizing done ahead of time that their intention was to start a riot.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Completely ignores that ANTIFA starts the violence and that people have to defend themselves. They are demonizing Trump supporters and praising ANTIFA as non-violent actual anti fascists when we all know that ANTIFA is nothing but violent communists! </p>

<p>There are literally hundreds if not thousands of more examples. You see they are not explicitly saying go out and kill Trump supporters but they are putting them into categories like &quot;racists&quot; or &quot;fascists&quot; which automatically justify violence against them. You cannot deny this and it&#39;s objective fact. They are conditioning people to excuse violence against Trump supporters because they are sub human or demon-like racist or nazis. </p>

<p><strong>They are telling people also that all Trump supporters want violence against minorities.</strong> This is enough for lots of people to justify violence against them or infringe upon their rights, like free speech. I&#39;ve even seen the Young Turks making fun of free speech by saying the <strong>freeze peach</strong> meme. </p>

<p>Also i dont have time to link all the times that &quot;The Young Turks&quot; have insinuated violence against conservatives, libertarians, or white people but they do it continuously. </p>

<p>You are comparing <strong>fringe</strong> &quot;conservative&quot; media like stormfront to <strong>mainstream</strong> liberal media. What makes radical leftist media so insidious is that it&#39;s presented as the de facto status quo. It&#39;s presented as the mainstream reality. Fox news surely doesn&#39;t match CNN or MSNBC in terms of radicalization and people like Tucker Carlson even debate against ANTIFA members and Carlson took the position that <strong>no one deserves violence for speech.</strong> You are bending over backwards to try and defend neoliberal authoritarians that try to destabilize and dive the population.</p>

<p>But even &quot;alternative&quot; &quot;right wing&quot; or libertarian media often tells their audience not to incite violence. Alex Jones, who you wrongly hate so much, continuously tells his audience not to be violent towards liberals. He has many crazy listeners and they have done things wrong before but that&#39;s not because Alex is telling them to do so. And the radical neoliberal globalist media twists his words and even his supporters&#39;s words. </p>

<p>They made Roger Stone to look violent when he was simply warning people that impeaching trump could lead to violence. He even said that he does no condone violence! Yet the media twisted his words which then could even have the negative effect which they are criticizing! </p>

<p>Look how radicalizing leftist media causes people to commit violence towards Alex himself! They turn people into literal fucking goblins! There were multiple people that attacked Alex that day and this is only one example:
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkW_x2MNf2w">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkW_x2MNf2w</a></p>

<p>So. I understand how you can say that conservative media has historically negatively influenced people in the past and they certainly have unfairly inspired prejudice against people like drug addicts, or women that get abortions. But almost always conservatives are smart enough to tell their listeners that violence is never okay, especially recently as the liberal media has begun to escalate their calls for violence!</p>

<p>And just because trailer trash has low iqs that ignores how conservatives usually have more money and are more successful. Billionaires are often conservatives or libertarian. </p>

<p>LOL, I am a fucking liberal! An actual liberal! A classical liberal! Youre just confused because you&#39;ve been subverted by neoliberal authoritarianism. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi friend, I&#39;ve decided to come back as more information is released, and it&#39;s starting to look like (shocking) you were wrong.</p>

<p>The guy was booking rooms over other large music festivals and likely had planned to hit others only to cancel them:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.fox29.com/news/tmz-stephen-paddock-booked-hotel-overlooking-lollapalooza-2-months-before-vegas-massacre">http://www.fox29.com/news/tmz-stephen-paddock-booked-hotel-overlooking-lollapalooza-2-months-before-vegas-massacre</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Investigators are looking into whether gunman Stephen Paddock scoped out bigger music festivals in Las Vegas and Chicago - and perhaps Boston&#39;s Fenway Park - before setting up his perch in a casino hotel and raining deadly fire on country music fans.</p>

<p>Paddock booked rooms overlooking the Lollapalooza festival in Chicago in August and the Life Is Beautiful show near the Vegas Strip in late September, according to authorities reconstructing his movements before he undertook the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Remember when I told you he was probably just looking to kill as many people as possible and shot up the event that let him do just that?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure it&#39;s possible he was targeting other gatherings. It&#39;s also possible that he was a gun runner, as well as other theories. The police made a statement about how they were investigating &quot;radicalization&quot; so that partially confirms Alex Jones&#39;s source that said literature was found in his hotel and even pictures showed a notepad. </p>

<p>I know you completely discredit Jones but that&#39;s actually being unreasonable and you probably have such a knee jerk reaction because you have been conditioned by mainstream shills like Colbert or Oliver. Alex has been right numerous times and people actually do seek him out to leak information. He also has some degree of integrity even if he is known for gratuitously exaggerating and using hyperbole. </p>

<p>An example of his exaggeration was when he had a member of the Navy Seals on his show who said that the gunfire sounded like multiple shooters yet the Seal said that with the caveat that in an urban environment the echoes make it confusing and impossible to say for sure. The next day on air Jones said that &quot;I just had a navy seal on who said it definitely sounded like there was more than one shooter.&quot; This is the kind of truth bending Alex is capable of but he still has an amount of integrity and rapport with his listeners. </p>

<p>For example he is known for famously predicting 9/11: </p>

<blockquote>

<p>The media actually makes fun of him for exposing things that are true:
Atrazine was actually discovered by a feminine black man so idk why liberals hate it so much: </p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmytXKe0OcM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmytXKe0OcM</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also Alex Jones is not racist like everyone thinks he is hes a fucking suuuuuuuper open minded guy and got super stoned and drunk on Joe Rogan&#39;s podcast. The reason that liberals are trying to paint him as a racist is because he is just the only one with balls enough to call out radical Islamists on air. But he also features Muslims on his show sometimes and they even talk about how fucked up parts of the fundamentalist culture are. Anyway it&#39;s ironic because liberals used to reject dogma but now defend it with regards to Islam. </p>

<p><strong>Anyway, my point is that it&#39;s likely someone really did contact Jones claiming to be Nevada Hostage Rescue.</strong> I can&#39;t verify his source but even Alex&#39;s employees questioned him on this while they were broadcasting and Alex has defended this source numerous times. I don&#39;t know if he verified them or not but i doubt that it was a bold faced lie. Mainstream media can afford to lie through their teeth but alternative media has to have some form of trust with their audience and Alex is ironically somewhat credible on a personal level. </p>

<p>That taken into consideration plus the police&#39;s statements about investigating radicalization makes me think it&#39;s likely they found some sort of literature or hints that he was into Islam or ANTIFA. </p>

<p>Then again that literature could have been a plant. This man could have been trying to orchestrate blame being put on Liberal media. It&#39;s possible that he was thinking about doing the same thing but reverse by attacking the other concerts you mentioned. Have you seen any of the forensic psychologists talk about this? The common theme in their analysis is that men usually have a motive, especially older men, when they do these kinds of things. His insanity could be multilayered and multifaceted. </p>

<p>There are also other theories like he was a gun runner. And there is no security footage that has been shown yet so that leaves a lot of questions. Apparently this guy had his own cameras as well. The whole thing leaves a lot of questions unanswered but I don&#39;t think my original theory was disingenuous as, again, the obvious first layer would be to look at the victims and speculate that he was targeting that group of people for a reason. I didn&#39;t mean for that theory to be the end all be all to this story but I think it was the obvious way to look at it from the first dimension of analysis. </p>

<p>Regardless liberal media, especially mainstream neoliberal media, is poignantly radicalizing and divisive. It seeks to paint conservatives, white people, or especially libertarians as the enemy. The fact they are targeting libertarians and capitalism, which in essence is just free trade, should be a huge red flag they are trying to brainwash people and get them to submit to authority, while also demonizing anyone who does not submit to authority. </p>

<p>Have you seen people saying that state&#39;s right&#39;s and low crime rates are dog whistling terms for racism? That is irrational and shows how <em>scared</em> the neoliberal establishment is of liberals realizing they would benefit from decentralized power. Trump getting elected proves how centralized power is vulnerable, like in our case, to the political pendulum. States rights would allow people to have their cake and eat it to but the neoliberals want control of the bakery.</p>

<p>Look at this clickbait shite that tries to lump states rights in with random racism and even tries to demonize people that criticized Obama as racists:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.newstatesman.com/world/2012/07/top-five-racist-republican-dog-whistles">https://www.newstatesman.com/world/2012/07/top-five-racist-republican-dog-whistles</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Liberal media even calls anyone against mass immigration racists or xenophobes. There are perfectly rational reasons why someone might not want open borders. Crime rates are real verifiable statistics yet countries literally do not record the origin or ethnicity of criminals to mask the fact that immigration is correlated to rising crime rates, which is especially noticeable in small European countries. It also does not help immigrants that are already in a country if that country loses stability because of immigration. <strong>The bottom line is that neoliberal politicians know that immigrants are likely to vote for socialist policies which give them more power and immigration causes a runaway authoritarian snowball effect.</strong>  </p>

<p>Ann Coulter of all people eloquently explains this in her interview with Ben Shaprio:</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>What&#39;s crazy is that these ideas are being pushed by Mainstream neoliberal media and they are promoting it as the status quo. Fox news used to be pretty bad but they never called on their viewers to impart violence on liberals and lately Tucker Carlson, their most popular broadcaster, has been promoting logic and even argues REGULARLY against ANTIFA members and BLM protesters about how everyone has a right to free speech:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The only right wing media which comes close to what the neoliberal establishment is peddling as mainstream, is extremist websites like storm front. Even Alex Jones has decency and tells his audience to respect people&#39;s rights. If you actually watch his show you will hear him constantly telling his listeners not to take the law into their own hands and always be model citizens, and its safe to say that since the Sandy Hook debacle, which he is apologetic for, he is careful to encourage his listeners in a healthy way and never to engage in violence. Meanwhile people like Rachel Maddow are telling their listeners that they are at war with Russia and to stop being friends with Trump supporters. </p>

<p>Get a load of this fucking shit. <strong>Morgan Freeman telling you that you are at war with russia.</strong></p>

<p>Remember Iraqi WMDs? How are you not having flashbacks? I feel like its a case of Deja Vu. The mainstream neoliberal media is trying to tell people to overthrow their own government (regime change) based on a false narrative which would surely result in violence and a power vacuum. Except instead of ISIS gaining control it would be brutal authoritarians enacting a totalitarian police state. </p>

<p>Go look at r/politics. They are literally convinced that anyone that speaks out against them are Russian Agents. I have literally been accused of being an agent of Putin <em>many</em> times. That&#39;s fucking ridiculous and if you don&#39;t call that radicalizing brainwashing I don&#39;t know what the fuck is.</p>

<p>My point is that yes, this latest shooting could be more complicated but it&#39;s still not off the table and neoliberal media is going to cause acts of violence in the future if they haven&#39;t already. And I am not some tribalist either. In fact, I am liberal, but I am the real kind of liberal, the kind that actual believes in <em>liberty</em> (You know word which liberal is derived from).</p>

<p>Liberalism actually used to respect freedom of the individual before it was fucking subverted and hijacked by <em>actual Russians</em> in the 1960s when the KGB planted agents in American Academia to traffic collectivism and blame the individual&#39;s freedom as a cause for inequality: 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bX3EZCVj2XA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bX3EZCVj2XA</a></p>

<p>Marxism is really nothing more than rationalizing violence and theft with jealously. That is why it&#39;s so dangerous. It&#39;s the same spirit which compels people to steal from corporations or rationalize theft or violence against rich people who they wrongly perceive as their oppressors. Sometimes things really should be free like with information property but if ANTIFA had its way there would be people forcefully entering your home and demanding to sleep there and redistribute any possessions you have worked for.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cool you just admitted that i win. The reason you don&#39;t like reading it is because all of it is fucking true. And if you would have bothered to look, I conceded that it&#39;s possible that he wasn&#39;t only targeting conservatives, yet I provided irrefutable evidence that mainstream liberal media is <em>much</em> more radicalizing than mainstream conservative media, and even Alex Jones is much less radicalizing. </p>

<p>It also <em>hasn&#39;t</em> been completely debunked and did you know  that all 3 of the concert stages he targeted were facing Mecca? Did you know that the police had made a statement they were investigating &quot;radicalization&quot;? This corroborates Alex Jones&#39;s source within the HRT team that said they found ISIS and ANTIFA literature, although I conceded it&#39;s possible that he left that writing there on purpose and could have a multi layered motive to make different groups look bad. </p>

<p>Anyway I should expect nothing less from a <em>radicalized</em> liberal such as yourself. You cannot bare to look at evidence that you are wrong because it&#39;s like holy water to a demon possessed individual such as yourself. Or should I say it&#39;s more like blasphemy which challenges your deeply ingrained dogmas. <strong>You have been conditioned so hardcore by neoliberal mainstream media that you actually support CNN doxxing redditors that say mean things on the internet.</strong> You don&#39;t care about free speech and all you want is death to the infidels. </p>

<p>Just know that, even though many real liberals like myself keep our mouths shut in the workplace and such; when you open your mouth talking about how Russia &quot;hacked&quot; the election, or you talk about impeaching Trump or supporting neoliberal  authoritarianism, we cringe on the inside and make a mental note that you are a total dumbass. You think that you are in the right and everyone supports you but there is a <em>silent majority</em> and the neoliberal status quo won&#39;t last for long.</p>

<p>And btw all your comments are giant blocks which use a bunch of quotes. Funny how you&#39;re only a fan of that writing style when it reinforces <em>your</em> violent dogmas. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The sheriff and the author of that article are liars. That article said there were no other political references or evidence of extremism even though the same Sheriff said they were investigating extremism earlier, and he is a confirmed liar and the FBI stands behind him in every fucking press conference and makes sure he doesn&#39;t spill the beans. That article clearly lied when it said Paddock hadn&#39;t been to any countries lately because there were pictures of him in <strong>Dubai</strong> dated to only a few months ago.  </p>

<p>Anyway, the case seems much more complicated now with the new evidence that is emerging. There was a helicopter close to the mandalay bay that was giving off a transceiver signal of southwest airlines then joined a group of 7 sightseeing helicopters when it left the rooftop. <strong>Paddock&#39;s fucking hard drive was stolen from his home after it was made into a crime scene. And his brother was busted for child pornography and his other brother for drugs.</strong> Who knows what kind of political evidence there might be on that missing hard drive. </p>

<p>Now, the whole thing seems much more suspicious and there is evidence of organized crime, including Paddock&#39;s family, and even private helicopter pilots being involved. </p>

<p>Immediately after this event happened my intention was to draw attention to the victims and the possible political motives of shooting up as country music festival, because the neoliberal progressives would not even consider that he may have been targeting conservatives, which is very hypocritical because you know they would be up in arms <strong>if he had shot up a rap concert.</strong></p>

<p>Furthermore, it seems that the Las Vegas HRT did really contact Alex Jones or at least someone claiming to be them, because he even admits now that they could have been feeding him misinfo or trying to hint at something else. </p>

<p>If you actually look into this case it&#39;s very confusing and there are a bunch of possibilities, but considering the radar evidence about the helicopters I think it was probably a heist that set up Paddock as a distraction  and fall guy. The place where the helicopter landed is connected to the Mandalay by a series of hallways and corridors. Ever seen Oceans 11? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We jyst went through active aggressor training at work. Run. Hide. Fight. </p>

<p>They pointed out that our will be easy to freeze up but to counter that you should prepare by thinking about what you would do. Especially at workb where you are at most of the day. What is your escape route. Do you have anything on your desk you can throw. If you have to kick yourself in your office move furniture ahead of time (keep a book case by the door) so it&#39;s easier to block the door.</p>

<p>They played the (heart breaking) audio recording of the school librarian who called 911 at Columbine. she directed the children to hide instead of run....and many of them died even though there was a window in the library. So learn that lesson- run if you can, hide if you can&#39;t run, fight as last resort, don&#39;t be a victim.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree on the &quot;hide&quot; part. Distance is your friend, like I originally said. However the training makes sense for the 90% of the population that won&#39;t react, or know what to do. We&#39;re all armchair quarterbacks at this point. Training makes you do things on instinct. Good or bad, but I&#39;ll take that 51% over 49% when your life is on the line. And your best shot is to get the hell out of the situation to begin with.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In most of these active shooter situations, lets assume its a shooter and not &quot;aggressor&quot; like some people try to dumb it down...</p>

<p>In a situation with a shooter, obviously shooting for mass casualty is what were using in our scenario... do you want to give him a full body target running away where you can&#39;t see him or predict his movements? What does honestly running away... usually down a hall or a building, running away gives the active shooter plenty of more opportunity to shoot MANY MORE people if people are moving.</p>

<p>At this point, STOP, DROP AND ROLL as a best practice seems best to me. Stay down, usually active shooters shoot at 90 degree angle...</p>

<p>if you roll around in a 3-4 circular ball crazily, your chances of an active shooter are only going to wound you drastically DROP if you do. (running away in masses creates a huge blob of a target that usually creates a disaster)</p>

<p>IDENTIFY the assailant and start throwing everything and anything at him, not to piss them off but to throw off their programming. Most actors do not come in this situation saying hey, im gonna shoot a bunch of people and when they start throwing anythign at me i&#39;m going to continue my gameplan, NO. They have to adapt to whatever it is coming at them, LITERALLY. It would not only break their concentration but cause a snap in usually their crazy psyched out brains.... </p>

<p>at least this is what makes sense to me, thinking about it for 15 minutes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes I know. From the interwebss.... in 2015..... </p>

<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>

<p>At the end of September, General Electric signed a tentative agreement with SST, Inc., maker of the popular ShotSpotter gunshot detection system now in use in more than 90 cities worldwide.
ShotSpotter utilizes sophisticated acoustic triangulation technology to identify the location of gunfire from a wide range of firearms. According to the company, the system has the ability to pinpoint the location of shots fired to within 10 feet, notify police dispatchers in real time of a crime in progress, and help law enforcement agencies create databases to ascertain shooting trends.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Within 10 feet.... in 2015.... they have better technology we&#39;re sure... Las Vegas.... has this. Has to have this. </p>

<p>While I&#39;m at it, if you ever hear gunshots and panic, the first thing you need to do (other than ducking/getting small) is attempt to gauge the general direction of the mayhem. Once you know where it&#39;s coming from you can then intelligently move away from it or seek proper cover.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The sheriff emphasized that Bennett did nothing wrong when Metro officers detained him outside The Cromwell, 3503 Las Vegas Blvd. South, the morning of Aug. 27. Lombardo said Bennett was detained for 10 minutes because he ran from a reported shooting inside the hotel while police commanded people to stay down.</p>

<p>Sounds to me like maybe it was just one with one or two accomplices. Maybe a preliminary thing to gauge their response? </p>

<p>The crazy thing was that I heard on the radio the call to breach the room on the 32nd floor.</p>

In each separate video i have seen the rate of fire is the same and goes on for an extended period of time or until the clip is empty. This would take large drum style clips to accomplish, and reloading these clips would take a long time.  A professional shooter with an automatic weapon would shoot in small bursts to maximize the effectiveness of their ammo and be able to aim easier. I would love to see actual security camera footage. I mean these are casinos. You would be hard pressed to find another building with more security cameras than these places.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Those timestamps aren&#39;t reliable, especially for random blogs. There&#39;s no way to know when a page was actually created, so google looks through the HTML and tries to find something formatted like a date that looks like it could be the &quot;published on&quot; date.</p>

<p>The problem is, sometimes the article writer copies an old template and forget to update the date, or they put other dates in there for some reason, or countless other things that confuse googles parser, and it ends up with the wrong date.</p>

<p>You can do a search for &quot;google new timestamps&quot; and see it&#39;s a pretty common problem.</p>

I&#39;m not sure why, but I can make a guess.

So part of the reason could be just plain resources, and the other may be they don&#39;t want to have to worry about potential comm issues when the shit hits the fan.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And why the fuck would they do that? Why not just actually kill people? The &quot;crisis actor&quot; narrative makes literally no logical sense, and is so laughable when you think of how riskier it is versus handing a crazy a gun and setting him loose if you honestly think literally every bad thing to happen in America ever is some government conspiracy. </p>

<p>Organizing hundreds, even thousands of people? Including journalists, many of which are honest people who are looking to expose government corruption (mostly on the local level - not talking about national CNN/MSNBC pundits and the like)?</p>

<p>It seems to me this whole thing came about because people started talking out their asses during Sandy Hook, found some &quot;convincing&quot; evidence that turned out to be fabricated, and are just running with this narrative whenever something bad happens.</p>

<p>You ask them why at Sandy hook everyone there wore actor badges and skeptics flock to give explanations which are clearly illogical to the context of the evidence presented.</p>

<p>Or why Sandy hook victims and standard bystanders all just walked around in circles in and out of the school and around it..a skeptic will always have some stupid explanation.</p>

<p>It&#39;s good to be skeptical. Just..as you ask questions..try to allow yourself to follow the evidence</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You misunderstand much about this issue. The answer is obvious because they want it to be obvious. </p>

<p>The reason tof have actors and other plants..is to cause comment fusion..many times real people are killed other times no one is killed. Truth is fake fake is truth..even when they make it hideously obvious to be fake such as botson..they laugh in your face.</p>

<p>Many shills are here..in this very thread..I applaud you all.</p>

<p>Many are truly concerned skeptics..I question..of what are you skeptical? That the government is incapable of creating such false scenarios? Please understand..they are not as dumb as they like to be portrayed. They are wolves.</p>

<p>Also consider shills show up to make many sound theories appear illogical.</p>

<p>As for this shooting..it&#39;s always good to take in evidence before making claims. There already exists immediate concerns of how this is happening. </p>

<p>&quot;...So you will need to watch a bunch of people die, then say exactly this script to the news, you got it? No, I need to hear all 25+ of you who the news will be interviewing that you got it. Okay. Great! I fully trust that none or all of you will intentionally fuck up this interview because what we&#39;re asking you to do is fucky!&quot;</p>

<p>How in the world would this NDA be enforced other than by a suspicious string of deaths of the survivors who spoke out? It&#39;s not like the US government can take them to court and sue them for this, exposing the whole thing. </p>

<p>Also - what narrative needs to be pushed? If this was &quot;faked&quot; there&#39;s only one vantage point from where the gunman was, and a bunch of big buildings echoing the shots - no one could immediately pinpoint what was happening anyway - what could a non-actor possibly say that would be off-narrative? </p>

<p>This whole thing is very cut and dry. Also - why is it so hard to believe that someone would/could do this without the government having to order it?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fuck off. You wouldn&#39;t believe proof anyway. Keep believing your stupid fucking narrative. </p>

<p>The story is fairly simple. There&#39;s no need to fake anything. If the government wanted to do this (they probably didn&#39;t BTW), all they had to do was hire a gunman and promise to protect him and set up a fall guy. </p>

<p>Why wouldn&#39;t the government have any reservations about killing people if they were gonna stage this? Why would any of this need to be faked in that sense?</p>

<p>God you guys are moronic.</p>

Guy is known to frequent Vegas and country music festivals specifically, family can&#39;t think of any reason he might do it: state that he didn&#39;t own any guns when he moved, has never been known to be into guns or have any violent tendencies. My thinking moves towards a serial-killer-type person who is casting the blame on the suspect. </p>

And he&#39;d also need to request a high floor. Are hotels in Vegas that accommodating to requests? Are concerts/events like this in this specific location common? If no, that makes this even more puzzling. So he would have had to reserve a room in a specific hotel for a specific date on a high floor facing a specific direction. Seems like this would be challenging to accomplish. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We&#39;re all ready getting the calls to take people&#39;s guns. I posted this on a similar thread.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Actually, you don&#39;t have a clue why your talking about. The US government does like a every 5 year review of what would happen if there was an organize insurrection/ civil war. And it doesn&#39;t go good for the US military. </p>

<p>Simply because there is about 1 gun for every American, the government have 300k soldiers. U.S. have 330 million people. So, imagine just 5% of the U.S. population armed like the hotel shooter. That&#39;s 15 MILLION people with 5 loaded shotguns and extra ammo.</p>

<p>There&#39;s supplies at every local store to make bombs. Not to mention what people can do during war time. </p>

<p>And that&#39;s not getting into details. </p>

<p>But the fact is that the US is wall to wall all over the whole country, dispersed better than our military, heavily armed citizens. Everywhere.</p>

<p>If people decided to take down the government, it would probably only take like 2.5 percent and a bit of organization. </p>

<p>You have to understand, the US government relies on at people to run shit. Imagine what happens if ALL electric grid goes down. And all the bridges get taken out. </p>

<p>This &quot;take away your guns shit&quot; is the US government trying to lull you into become truly defenseless. For ever 1 mass shooter, there hundreds of thousand of responsible gun owners. The government wants them gone so there can&#39;t be an insurrection in case they want to do something bad.</p>

<p>Imagine if the government decides to outlaw and kill any antifa member as they are a domestic terrorist Group. Summary execution. The government has all your internet data, all your calls, all your texts, where you live, what time your home, where you work, who you associate with, and your location for the past 60 days.</p>

<p>Trust me, those dumb fuck knee jerk liberals will want the guns then. </p>

<p>Everyone&#39;s like, our sweet government would never do that. Except that&#39;s why government does. Protects its people from domestic terrorists. It just why group they want to exterminate first. </p>

<p>Shit I&#39;m listening to some person talk about black lives matter as a terrorist group. You all don&#39;t know what your talking about. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, it would be trivially easy to request a room near the top. Once you&#39;ve done that, it&#39;s a 50/50 chance that you&#39;re facing the concert. If you&#39;re not facing the concert, you complain and they put you where you want to be. Worst case scenario, you come back and try again the next day.</p>

<p>He was in the hotel for three days, so it seems like he prepared for the eventuality that he got the wrong room.</p>

<p>Also, even when hotels &quot;sell out&quot; they frequently have rooms reserved for VIPs. IE, if you&#39;re a big gambler and you show up at the Mandalay Bay and the hotel is &quot;sold out&quot;, they&#39;ll figure out how to put you up in a room. And ironically, those &quot;reserved&quot; rooms are often the suites with a great view and lots of room (because you&#39;re a VIP.)</p>

<p>Vegas hotel rules are a lot different than your typical business hotel.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Things don&#39;t add up, that&#39;s for sure. A lot of people think it was either bumpfire, an FA mod or a crank mod due to the fact that the speed of the bullets fired didn&#39;t seem consistent.</p>

<p>The false reports of multiple shooters could be due to echoing of gunfire, leading people to believe there was more than one shooter. The scanner audio does suggest there were multiple shooters though, so I am conflicted about that. It could very well be a confusion tactic.</p>

<p>I think the biggest thing that throws me off is indeed the supposedly massive amount of guns and ammo found as well as the rest of the setup in the hotel suite.</p>

<p>The floor shown in the picture is more likely to be around floors 16-18, the hotel has 43 floors total. Then again I&#39;ve also read that the layout of the hotel is odd and that it skips numbers (?). The flashing in the picture was also present in later live footage on FOX I believe, so perhaps it is not muzzle flashing. Ofcourse I could be wrong about any of these things, just adding my two cents.</p>

For all they know, they&#39;re reporting the &quot;truth&quot;.

You have people feeding the MSM what to report on and what to say.

</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m sorry, what does &quot;not 100% sure the hierarchy of news outlets&quot; mean?  Do you know how news organizations work or not?  Do you have journalism experience?  Have you worked at a major newspaper or on a TV news crew?  What experience and knowledge do you really have of how news organizations work?</p>

<p>It&#39;s ok to admit you don&#39;t know things.  What&#39;s bad, is making things up, like &quot;I&#39;m pretty sure for big news stories, they&#39;re given information about the situation and then report it how they see fit (adding biases, etc). If they&#39;re not getting their information from someone/somewhere, where are they getting their information from?&quot;</p>

<p>News reporters engage in a process of discovery when a major story is breaking.  The first thing they do is they start calling people.  Police, hospitals, the venue, all good places to start.  They check social media, check police scanners, essentially, they dig for information from any source they can find.</p>

<p>If you were listening to the BBC last night for instance, you would have run across them doing this live, calling a hospital in the middle of the crisis to inquire about casualty counts from the desk nurse, on air.  They are not &quot;given&quot; information, they look for it.  Once they have a piece of information they try to confirm it.  If they can confirm it, usually with a second source, they report it.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not possible to control what information they get since the government can&#39;t control who they call, who they talk to and what information they gather.  They can&#39;t possibly anticipate who each individual journalist would call or contact.    </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I may have found something interesting. If you go to the NV Clark County.gov site you can actually look up voter history-
<a href="http://www.clarkcountynv.gov/election/Pages/ElectionHistory.aspx">http://www.clarkcountynv.gov/election/Pages/ElectionHistory.aspx</a></p>

<p>Basically you choose the year, and the election and then by selecting &quot;Generate Voter History File&quot; you get a big long text doc showing you a list of every voter who participated in that election. Obviously it doesn&#39;t list who people voted for, but it does list party affiliation, district number, voting method etc etc.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve gone all the way back to the 2000 General Election and I see no record of a Stephen Paddock or any similar name. I also don&#39;t see any &quot;Paddocks&quot; that were registered in Mesquite NV.</p>

<p>The obvious conclusion being that this person was not an active voter. (at least not in Clark County, NV)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Get ready for more instances like this to keep happening. Make no mistake, they will keep happening until we all surrender and say &quot;Okay, we will give up our guns if the government will keep us safe.&quot; More shootings will take place in the near future until, as a country, we are forced to give up our defenses. Mainly the southern region, but many other Americans carry weapons as well. It&#39;s happening guys. Anyone else wonder if these things are orchestrated? I&#39;m sure we all have those thoughts. If only we could get definitive proof and evidence. Most of the evidence is just not enough, but we know what is really going on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Serious question, and not looking to argue, just looking for other perspectives: if we keep putting more guns in people&#39;s hands, will mass shootings not just continue?</p>

<p>When this totally normal, $400k house owning, ex-pilot with no criminal record goes berserk, what is the solution? Just let shootings happen and call it an anomaly? </p>

<p>Once again, not trying to attack, just looking for other views. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a very valid point and I absolutely see where you are coming from. The truth is, this is a complex issue and there will never be a great solution to it. Where I live (Missouri) MANY people in the town (population of about 15,000 people) own weapons, more than one. We have never had a school shooting or anything even close to it. Most people are hunters, gun enthusiasts, or own one for protection. It&#39;s easy for me to say &quot;keep the guns,&quot; because I live in a small town and haven&#39;t had much experience living other places except for a year in St. Louis, MO, and half a year in China. I definitely feel a lot safer here than I did in St. Louis and I was like 1 of the 6 or 7 white dudes living in my densely populated neighborhood. So, I am biased because I have grown up conservative. Maybe it&#39;s the bigger cities that don&#39;t need guns, but had someone with a handgun been next to the shooter without him seeing, he <em>could have - not would have</em> ended the shooting at 4 dead and 25 wounded instead of what it is now. Granted, that&#39;s an optimistic outlook. With this guy going berserk, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a matter of <em>who it is going berserk</em> but rather <em>who can be there to stop that person</em> instead of waiting for authorities when it may be too late. Thanks for asking sincerely, I love when I can converse with people without harsh underlying comments and what not. This was my genuine answer. :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you believe the account that this was just one person that was normal and snapped? </p>

<p>Everyone I know that owns guns is a reasonable person that isn’t going to snap and shoot up ordinary people, especially with fully automatic assault rifles. </p>

<p>I don’t know what to believe but I always ask questions whenever MSM delivers a “fact”.  </p>

<p>I personally believe that citizens owning guns keeps the government in check.  </p>

<p>3) bloody victims being attended to by EMT or being loaded into ambulances, or being unloaded from ambulances at the hospital, or being carried into a hospital ER</p>

<p>More likely, the buildings on the strip made the gunfire echo and this caused various locations to think someone was firing there and call 911. </p>

<p>People running from the crowd and in shock piling into the lobby of a hotel across the street all saying someones shooting... People there gonna call 911. </p>

It clearly isn’t the 32 floor so it can’t be Paddock at Mandala Bay, right?</p>

I understand deeply your 2nd amendment, and your right to defend it. But it comes with a cost. And youve seen that cost time and time again, from columbine to aurora to this. Isnt it time you guys really looked deeply into your 2nd amendment? Is it worth it? I get it, at one point the government might turn against you and attack you, and you would want to defend yourself. But honestly, thats such an entirely big stretch that its extremely unlikely it will ever happen. Besides, if it does happen - are you prepared to just open fire against multiple police? IF that should happen? Are you even capable of that? And again, at what cost? Is it really worth it?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fair enough. Just thought his gambelling connections might be linked to his story. </p>

<p>Is 62 common for breaks in mental psych (presuming he was a productive and healthy citizen before this)? I know early 20s/late teens is a sensitive age. Not that it matters, just makes me feel as bad for him as the victims. Hard to think something like an illness would make you do a thing like that.</p>

<p>Why a fucking idiot. That’s a good way to get mistaken for a 2nd shooter by everybody.</p>

<p>People trying to play hero only create confusion for the police and anybody running around with a gun who’s not in a cop uniform is going to scare all the panic bystanders around them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sometimes heroes are necessary and it would have been worth the risk to get mistaken if it meant you could engage the shooters and end the threat. In Paris for example Dan would have been really useful because the terrorists just shot people in site with no one confronting them. Although in Vegas he couldn&#39;t have done much because the threat was concealed in a vantage point very far away, at the moment he had no way of knowing if he would be able to engage the threat. So I think if he came out with a gun he did the right thing. But the problem is what if there is another good samaritan with a gun and there are still shots ringing out, they both can mistake each other, specially in such an anxious state of mind. But I guess that&#39;s an acceptable risk which happens many times in actual combat in war zones. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;In an interview on Monday morning, Eric Paddock spoke about how shocked he was to learn that his brother was the suspected gunman.</p>

<p>Eric said that his brother was &#39;not an avid gunman&#39; and &#39;has no military background&#39; while speaking with CBSN, adding that he had no idea how he might have been able to obtain automatic weapons.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>&quot;He had a couple of guns but they were all handgun, legal...he might have had one long gun, but he had them in a safe,&#39; explained Eric.&quot;</strong></p>

<p>Give me a a break. No military. No &quot;10 rifles&quot;, and he was a 62 year old schooled retiree with a wife and kids. This is not a gunman. And who the fuck brings 10 rifles. Two max and a bunch of drum magazines would have the same effect. &quot;An orgt of evidence&quot; is what I see here. And for what?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>im in favor of gun control, ESPECIALLY for the mentally ill but it doesnt keep guns out of places they dont belong. this will be like 9/11 for vegas. everything will be about security now, though it ultimately wont mean much.</p>

<p>any huge outdoor public gathering is susceptible to this, especially if guns that can be made full auto with high capacity mags are available</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Following this logic the USA should also ban all people who live in inner cities, or &quot;ghettos&quot; since they statistically commit more crimes than any other demographic. Teenaged drivers should also be banned because they cause the most accidents. All men should also be banned since they are the majority of domestic abusers. Women should be banned because they are the percentage majority of convicts charged and imprisoned with theft, larceny, and fraud. Also anybody who has ever committed a crime should be banned, since they are more likely to commit another crime than people who haven&#39;t. Juveniles should be banned as well, since they are the most likely to commit vandalism and underage drinking. Just because the majority of mass shooters are white males, does not mean that the majority of white males are mass shooters. Using that kind of logic is how the holocaust happened.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Crisis actors end up being a small part of false flags. They are never the deciding factor for me. They are merely supporting evidence after the fact. Normally, many other huge flags go up signaling inconsistencies. Just depends on the specifics. We had a ton of injured crisis actors in the Boston Bombing vs just the parents in say Sandy Hook who weren&#39;t injured at all. They are present at all of these events but each have differing roles of importance to television and image so to speak. </p>

<p>Times are PST - this is without speculation as to questionable/falsified claims on behalf of the news and police</p>

<p>~10:00pm - shots begin to break out over the Route 91 Harvest Concert</p>

<p>~10:30pm - videos captured and uploaded start to spread online, media begins reporting active shooter, /pol/ identifies Marilou Danley as a suspect who previously went up on stage and said/warned/declared to the crowd &quot;you&#39;re all going to die soon&quot; and begins connecting her online profiles, her husband Geary Danley is also found and identifies as a hardleft democrat.</p>

<p>~11:00pm - Police shut down parts of Vegas strip /pol/ and T_D continue to view various streams on the ground include multiple periscope feeds from civilians.</p>

<p>~11:30pm - people begin getting evaced to medical facilities, I-15 is closed, death reports start coming in.</p>

<p>~12:00am - police breach suspects room and declare suspect is &quot;down&quot; (reports vary between this time and later on when it&#39;s declared the gunman shot himself.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So this a throwaway. But I have plenty friends and family in Vegas and they knew people in attendance at the festival. Thankfully nobody they know we&#39;re injured or killed, just very shaken up. There was definitely more than one shooter. My cousin was listening to police scanners live and they were calling in false shooting reports at multiple hotels. One person couldn&#39;t have possibly executed such a calculated and organized massacre by themselves. This needs to be exposed. A lone wolf attack is one thing but an organized strike with diversion calls being made is another thing. Fuck the media, this needs to be known.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I disagree with this statement. It would be very simple for one person to pull this off. In fact its probably the least chance to get caught. I have two big pieces of luggage (cause I self park and carry my own bags in) ...at best there is footage of the shooter dragging bags like everyone else. Fitting say 1000 .556 (AR ammo) into a bag is nothing...it does not take up that much space..the other bag is my weapons broken down...an AR taken apart could fit in a small bag...but ok so say I have three long guns and 7 handguns...all that very easily fits in one of my wifes bags she takes on vacation....</p>

<p>this is actually not a complicated attack..IMO you don&#39;t even have to be a great shooter..where he was compared to the crowd you just spray and pray ...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I live in Vegas and something just isn&#39;t sitting well with me about all this. The windows at those hotels don&#39;t open, specifically mandalay bay I&#39;ve been in tons of times and their windows don&#39;t open. If he shot the window out, it should&#39;ve sent off alarms, Vegas hotels are really vigilant about not being the hotel someone used to jump out of a window, or a fire. The cops blew open the door supposedly but those locks are all electronic, the front desk can buzz them open. I have friends on my social media that reported shootings elsewhere on the trip on their facebook, this isn&#39;t a &#39;distraction&#39; cause they posted as they heard them telling people to be careful of the area... there&#39;s no way this shooter acted alone, and Vegas is infamous for covering up bad news, or making it seem less &#39;bad&#39; -- a 1 off crazy retired guy is an easier pill to swallow than 5 shooters and we only found one.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thu, Apr 20, 2017 (1:22 p.m.)
FRESNO, Calif. — Acoustic sensors mounted on lampposts and telephone poles picked up the crack of gunfire and rapidly enabled police to zero in on where it was coming from. Within minutes, the alleged gunman in the deadly rampage was under arrest.</p>

<p>Fresno Police Chief Jerry Dyer credited the technology Wednesday with the swift capture of Kori Ali Muhammad, a 39-year-old black man who authorities say killed three people Tuesday in a bid to wipe out as many whites as possible.</p>

<p>&quot;He was in custody within 4 minutes and 13 seconds,&quot; Dyer said Wednesday at a news conference where he played audio clips of the ShotSpotter technology. &quot;Kori Muhammad would be outstanding today if it wasn&#39;t for shots-fired detection.&quot;</p>

<p>SpotShotter is widely used in U.S. cities. The Fresno rampage is one of the more serious crimes in which it played a vital role.</p>

<p>But people do insane stuff for money...</p>

<p>Just not sure how something like hiring crisis actors off Craig&#39;s list could keep that kind of secret..
Dozens of people murdered and they think they need to shut their mouths for a few hundred bucks?
(Assuming it&#39;s only $25/hour like the ad said)</p>

<p>The whole crisis actor theory is kinda far fetched I think. There&#39;s no way the average Joe, who is hired to be part of a mass murder could keep their mouths shut about it...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is anyone else out there wondering if Stephen Paddock was even involved in the shooting at all? Now, I know he may have been responsible.  But I can&#39;t help wondering if perhaps there&#39;s more to this story than just that. </p>

<p><strong>LVPD Scanners: Multiple shooters/aggressors</strong></p>

<p>• (Edit 4 - MSNBC and LVPD (on the scanner) confirming at least 2 shooters.)</p>

<p><strong>MSM: Single shooter narrative</strong></p>

<p>• Edit 24 - MSNBC now saying on air “no more shooters involved.” However eyewitness accounts claim multiple. Let the fuckery begin.</p>

<p>• Edit 27 - “Can you please tell media to back off, we don’t have all suspects accounted for.” </p>

<p>• Edit 28 - MSM continues to push the “no more shooters” narrative. Meanwhile, LVPD keep saying they have not apprehended all suspects.</p>

<p><strong>LVPD: Meanwhile, Stephen Paddock already dead (yet the chaos continues)</strong></p>

<p>• Edit 7 - Suspect down, floor 32 Mandalay Bay, room 135. </p>

<p>• Edit 13 - Looks like the remaining active shooter is at The Flamingo</p>

<p>• Edit 15 - Male walking into The Bellagio with a rifle. </p>

<p>• Edit 19 - Shot fired at Bellagio. Automatic fire could be heard on the scanner.</p>

<p>• Edit 20 - Audi with car bomb was left by 4 males. </p>

<p>I know we don&#39;t have much information yet, but I tend to take whatever the media says and turn about 85-90% of it says and usually believe the polar opposite. What are you guys thinking on this? Was Stephen Paddock the sole shooter, part of a team of shooters, or even setup to take the fall?</p>

They take advantage of the ensuing chaos and confusion to give themselves &#39;plausible deniability&#39; regarding the information eyewitnesses come forward with, or what they themselves later recant. This is probably gonna end up like Sandy Hook and Orlando, relegated to the fringe internet theories of a few tin foil hat crazies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, call me crazy, but I&#39;m not even convinced this guy actually did it.  It sounds more like a gun deal gone bad to me and one of the parties went nuts (or maybe I&#39;ve just seen too many movies). I mean, I think Paddock may have had limited involvement in putting the deal together (or something) and renting the rooms (perhaps), but I don&#39;t think he&#39;s the one that actually did the shooting. Of course, I could be wrong, and we may never know what really happened, but video of activity in the hallways and parking garage before and during the event would prove me right or wrong.  I hope we get to see it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s clear that the incident happened. What&#39;s not clear is the motive. That is the frightening part. False Flag operations usually create situations where some new law is enacted, and thus more civil liberties are taken away. Scary times. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe someone from the Deep State saw how &quot;People Power&quot; was pushing back at the police/military forces in Spain during the Catalan Referendum, and they got scared, so they created another false flag to create fear &amp; panic. I know they want to take our guns away. I know they want us to become docile sheep. The question is how are they going to pull it off? The good news more people are aware about false flag operations thanks to the Internet. If the Internet ever got regulated then we&#39;re all screwed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a good point too... I just don&#39;t know. I&#39;m just sad &amp; scared for the future for every decent loving person&#39;s sake. We&#39;re all being duped, but by whom or by how I just don&#39;t know. The Government takes more of our civil liberties away, and at what cost?? Banning Muslims sure as Hell didn&#39;t work this time. If they ban handguns or MR15&#39;s, then what if someone uses a home made bomb? Ban kitchen pots? I&#39;m upset at the loss of life, and if this guy named Steve is guilty then may he burn in Hell forever! But what if he was a patsy, and set-up to hold those guns in those rooms? I am just at a loss for words, and I&#39;m emotionally drained. It&#39;s as if fear has griped the entire nation, and anything we do or say takes us one step closer to a Totalitarian State. </p>

<p>And there was a couple users that helped but, legit just eventually gave up</p>

<p>There was nothing I could do to prove anything. They could provide me with obviously fake news and I&#39;d give real news and I was still wrong. </p>

<p>Its crazy they have a way to falsely sway so many minds. It&#39;s really messed up to even think a large group of people undertake such a task</p>

<p>Idk im Canadian, maybe I never really fathomed something like this takes place. </p>

<p>You I always see this as traitorist, act of treason, the effort they make to deliberately damage and corrupt the American people and the way it operates. </p>

<p>If thats not unpatriotic thing a think a citizen can do to its country. </p>

<p>There should be no way all this goes unchecked </p>

Also why are you holding a beer during an active shooter event? At that point when people are on the ground or running away it should be clear that its time to ditch the beer and gtfo. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah i guess i wouldn&#39;t know what i would do either as I&#39;ve never been in such a situation before just saying i expected a much different response.

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not desensitized it is just that when you hear gunshots you at first don&#39;t even realize they are gun shots, although with automatic fire you probably realize more quickly they are gun shots but my guess is that most people would be more in a state of disbelief and wonder than in a state of panic. Maybe gang members in Chicago would panic more easily if they hear gun shots but people who are not used to gun fights don&#39;t really have a warning system in their mind that makes them go in panic mode for gun shots. </p>

It sounds very careless, but I don&#39;t know what specific language they used, since this is the first I&#39;ve heard of it. Aren&#39;t they supposed to have codes for this kinda stuff? Also, it&#39;s my understanding that police use secure communication channels, but still use open airwaves for low security clearance stuff.

I very recently observed a moderation situation on r/portland, who – despite their rules – protected the pretty low insults and attacks of a generally civil and very regular user who has had a few rare outbursts.  It&#39;s often difficult to differentiate many otherwise quality subs from cliques and popularity contests.

<p>As a side note, if there was a entity (that I&#39;m assuming is of a profile that would require some semblance of secrecy and would prefer for this to not be questioned, so basically not natural terrorists) performed these shootings simultaneously in multiple places, and the game plan was to just say &quot;one did it lol&quot; as their game plan, that would a comically bad plan. Further I don&#39;t really get why they&#39;d pull it down intentionally, it seems counterproductive to what I imagine someone would like to portray imo.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Isn&#39;t that how you execute an operation and blame it on a cut-out/fall guy?</p>

<p>Draw your cutout into a group, come up with a plan and then convince the cutout he&#39;s the guy they&#39;re invested in performing the operation.  Only the operators know the guy really can&#39;t be counted on, so there are backup/secondary operatives who guarantee the mission goes down.  The whole thing is planned so that the cutout is nearly guaranteed to get killed, thus making the &quot;lone gunman&quot; narrative impossible to question and the conspiracy&#39;s evidence dying with the cutout.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying this actually happened, but since this modus operandi can be applied after the fact to nearly every lone gunman shooting, it becomes kind of standard conspiracy theory logic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Things don&#39;t add up, that&#39;s for sure. A lot of people think it was either bumpfire, an FA mod or a crank mod due to the fact that the speed of the bullets fired didn&#39;t seem consistent.</p>

<p>The false reports of multiple shooters could be due to echoing of gunfire, leading people to believe there was more than one shooter. The scanner audio does suggest there were multiple shooters though, so I am conflicted about that. It could very well be a confusion tactic.</p>

<p>I think the biggest thing that throws me off is indeed the supposedly massive amount of guns and ammo found as well as the rest of the setup in the hotel suite.</p>

<p>The floor shown in the picture is more likely to be around floors 16-18, the hotel has 43 floors total. Then again I&#39;ve also read that the layout of the hotel is odd and that it skips numbers (?). The flashing in the picture was also present in later live footage on FOX I believe, so perhaps it is not muzzle flashing. Ofcourse I could be wrong about any of these things, just adding my two cents.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sometimes heroes are necessary and it would have been worth the risk to get mistaken if it meant you could engage the shooters and end the threat. In Paris for example Dan would have been really useful because the terrorists just shot people in site with no one confronting them. Although in Vegas he couldn&#39;t have done much because the threat was concealed in a vantage point very far away, at the moment he had no way of knowing if he would be able to engage the threat. So I think if he came out with a gun he did the right thing. But the problem is what if there is another good samaritan with a gun and there are still shots ringing out, they both can mistake each other, specially in such an anxious state of mind. But I guess that&#39;s an acceptable risk which happens many times in actual combat in war zones. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>how is all of this more believable to you then just some dude snapping and killing loads of people? im honestly surprised these mass shootings dont take place more often. and i definitely don&#39;t believe theyre all just made up. humans are fucked up and do fucked up things. especially when guns are involved, its very easy for delusional people to just point a pull a trigger.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not much context to go on here. Was this a bad practice, then? It sounds very careless, but I don&#39;t know what specific language they used, since this is the first I&#39;ve heard of it. Aren&#39;t they supposed to have codes for this kinda stuff? Also, it&#39;s my understanding that police use secure communication channels, but still use open airwaves for low security clearance stuff. I&#39;m not disputing you here, but I&#39;m super curious to know more about what happened. No worries if you don&#39;t respond, because I&#39;ll probably do my own research later after I look through the thread a bit.</p>
