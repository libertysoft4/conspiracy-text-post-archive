<p>I found out about this about 5 hours ago, I live in the UK. I&#39;m baffled with how little footage and information there is by now (not relying on MSM for my info)</p>

<p>And that there lies the problem. They are civilians, unless they are a faction of the US military and if they are now considered that, we have a full blown militarized police state, and that should make all question how and when the hell that happened.</p>

<p>Um, the second amendment of the US constitution would like to have a word with you:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State,</strong> the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That appears to be &quot;government support&quot;. Very odd how you do not know what&#39;s in the US constitution. Are you from the US?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Nope, they are right here:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not the one. You&#39;ve deleted the others after I caught and called you out. Very suspicious how you just pick a random comment of yours and show it as proof or something. Suspicious as hell. But makes sense, because you have a shady account.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Never happened, as shown above. Don&#39;t understand why you are lying about something so easy to show is untrue ...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Did happen, you deleted them, and you know that. Why are you lying, if you have nothing to hide? Weird...</p>

<p>Anyways, I&#39;ve learned that discussing with you is pointless after a while, you use the same tactic over and over. So, with that, I shall 
bid adieu.</p>
