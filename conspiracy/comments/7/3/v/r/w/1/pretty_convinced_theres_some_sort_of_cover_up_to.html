        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">773</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2017-10-02 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/Watmanwat.html">Watmanwat</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>At 10:08pm on 10/01/17, a 64 year old man named Stephen Paddock opened fire from the 32nd floor of Mandalay Bay towards the Route 91 Country Music festival. Jason Aldean had just gone on stage when the shots started flying. There is at least 515 injured and at least 58 dead.</p>

<p>I live in Las Vegas off the I-15. Around 10:20pm I heard cavalrys, convoys of police sirens hauling ass past my house on the freeway. More than 100 cops had to have gone by. Easily 100mph+. Grabbed my scanner, googled scanner numbers, heard an active shooter on the strip. Turn on news and it&#39;s confirmed.</p>

<p>I listened to the scanner from 10:30pm almost until 2am. I listened as they found the suspect dead in his room, strike teams were sent to different locations, medics sent everywhere, them clearing Mandalay Bay floor by floor, them finding 1200 people in the Michael Jackson Theatre, all of it.</p>

<p>Here is where it does NOT add up to me.
As soon as I turned on the news I heard gunshots(around 10:20-10:25) I wish I would have recorded it. Around 10:30pm they found the shooter dead in his room. They say it&#39;s a lone wolf act but in NUMEROUS VIDEOS you can hear two different guns firing at the same time. Not only that, but the weapons they found in his room were assault rifles. 10 of them, thousands of rounds of ammo.
Here&#39;s where I started to think something was wrong. Over the scanner, me and my mom VERY CLEARLY heard a 4 bullet burst. Then two different officers asked, &quot;Shots fired?&quot; Silence, 2 more burst of fully automatic fire, and another officer, &quot;Shots fired??&quot;. There was about a minute of radio static then resumed back to the normal strike team placement etc. Here&#39;s the kicker: The SWAT had already found the suspect dead in his room. I do not have an accurate timeline on this, actually, I just remembered. This had to be before 11:00pm because that&#39;s when the sheriff did the first interview with the news and it was before that.</p>

<p>There&#39;s also the suspect. He had no outstanding charges, he never had prior weapon experience, no military background, was an all around good guy according to his brother. His brother was interviewed and even has texts going back and forth between the two with nothing leading up to anything like this. He claimed they were just normal brothers, he had actually texted about mom if I remember.</p>

<p>Another part that doesn&#39;t add up is the fact that they delayed evacuating the Michael Jackson theatre for a few hours. If the police allowed MEDICAL to respond inside Mandalay Bay, that means they have the scene secure. My cousin is a paramedic in Lincoln County and he confirmed that that&#39;s the procedure. If they were allowing medical on scene to Mandalay Bay, why was there such a confusing hiatus on evacuating that Michael Jackson theatre? It might be there was over 1000 people but I&#39;m more than certain by all the videos I&#39;ve seen that people knew what was going on and they were staying calm during all this.</p>

<p>Also. Why did the shooter need to break two different windows in two adjacent rooms at Mandalay Bay to shoot at one target? If the concert had a view, why break the second one to shoot from?</p>

<p>-Over the scanner I heard there was a gunman in:</p>

<p>-New York New York&#39;s front desk </p>

<p>-New York New Yorks main escalator </p>

<p>-Mandalay Bay -Gate 6/7 of Route 91 Festival (either or can&#39;t specifically remember)</p>

<p>Which makes sense, considering how many people they&#39;ve been finding injured/dead scattered around. But police later confirmed it was people calling in from these casinos to report shots fired. But I heard from someone working at a bar in Mandalay Bay that he was helping people get cover from a shooting. He said the scene just erupted and it was an adrenaline rush haze. I can&#39;t really speak for him but that&#39;s what he told me.
It just doesn&#39;t make sense that we heard shots fired on the scanner last night after they found the suspect dead. I&#39;m just gonna make a list of the stuff that don&#39;t add up:</p>

<p>Shots fired over police scanner after suspect found dead.</p>

<p>Multiple full auto weapons can be heard overlapping each other when fired on video</p>

<p>The suspect had no experience, background, or anything to do with weapons/military</p>

<p>It took hours to evacuate a theatre inside a casino that was already considered &quot;secure&quot;</p>

<p>Suspect was fully accurate firing from 320 feet up across a street from a casino</p>

<p>Victims found in New York New York, Mandalay Bay, Route 91, and Aria but shots fired only at Mandalay Bay</p>

<p>I&#39;ve just been talking to way more people than normal who live here because of this, and most of us are certain that there might be some conspiracy here. Driving home today confirmed to for me when I looked up and saw the two windows smashed out at Mandalay Bay. This is my first post here and it&#39;s a big one, but a lot of us in Vegas aren&#39;t buying this. Whether the suspect was set up, there was multiple gunners, I don&#39;t know.

<h2></h2>

<h2></h2>

<p>Edit #1: As of 9:13pm, at least 59 dead, 527+ injured. Suspects room had 23 weapons in it. Bunch of mixed reports still around all the Vegas radios and news stations. An off duty cop was killed at the concert I&#39;m guessing out of coincidence. </p>

<p>On a lighter note, a lot of local businesses gave shelter and refuge to people, different casinos are offering free rooms to any survivor/victim&#39;s family/next of kin. So much blood has been donated that all the banks are full and you need to schedule appointments for when they need blood next. Multiple food drives have been organized, crates of dried food and canned food for responders and victims being hospitalized. Over 2.6 million USD has been raised, I remember waking up at 8, donation was at 130k, took a shower and was leaving at 8:30 and it was at 650k, insane. Raiders donated 50k, multiple celebrities donated 10k each, etc. Just everything I can bring up that&#39;s positive about the situation.</p>

<h2></h2>

<h2></h2>

<p>Update #2, 6:58am 10/03/17. I forgot to include something very major to all this. </p>

<p>Around 45 minutes before the concert was interrupted, a &quot;mystery lady&quot; was going around yelling at concert goers that they were gonna die. Witnesses say that she was taken by security and dragged out. There isn&#39;t just one person claiming this too, it&#39;s a ton of people. So there was a lady going around telling people they were gonna die, couldn&#39;t have been his roommate Marilou either considering she is out of the country. Here&#39;s a link for some info:</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/ubi_M44vfrU">https://youtu.be/ubi_M44vfrU</a></p>

<p>Edit #3: Everybody is saying that they can&#39;t find video footage of this event and multiple gunshots going off at the same time. It was the 2nd video down on YouTube when I searched on there and it&#39;s the exact first one I saw of the event. And the reason I&#39;m addressing the multiple guns thing because I&#39;m more than convinced an echo can&#39;t just change the rate of fire a guns going at. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s almost like when automatic gunfire erupts in the middle of the night in an urban area where there are thousands of people milling about things can get confusing.

    <div class="md"><p>Great post. </p>

<p>A bunch of people are saying that there was only one gun but the echo of the sound bouncing off the buildings made it sound like there was multiple shooters but I don&#39;t believe that narrative. There&#39;s clearly two different caliber weapons being fired. </p>

<p>Also, it was said that the two windows were in the same room in one of the hotels &quot;Vista suites&quot;. I don&#39;t understand the reasoning if you are the only one shooting unless it&#39;s to draw attention away from the window you&#39;re in if you were expecting to be met with sniper fire as a diversion.</p>

<p>There was also a video of a guy yelling around that they weren&#39;t real gunshots, but nothing else I&#39;ve found has supported that argument. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Multiple full auto weapons can be heard overlapping each other when fired on video</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Where do you hear this?</p>

<p>When supersonic rounds are being shot around you, if they go past you, you will hear the supersonic crack/whizz of the round first and then if you are within close enough range of the shooter, you hear the sound of the rifle firing. You hear 2 sounds for every round if close enough.</p>

<p><a href="http://library.la84.org/SportsLibrary/Outing/Volume_65/outLXV05/outLXV05c.pdf">http://library.la84.org/SportsLibrary/Outing/Volume_65/outLXV05/outLXV05c.pdf</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>At considerable range two distinct reports are audible to the person by whom the bullet is passing.</strong> At 700 yards the sound may be described phonetically as &quot;PACK-punk.&quot; The first sound comes about ¾ second ahead of the latter in the case of the United States army rifle, the New Springfield. The velocity of this rifle is 2,700 feet per second at the muzzle. The first sound is that of the bullet passing through the air. It is like nothing so much as a long and very violently cracked blacksnake whip. The second sound comes about ¾ second later. It is dead, heavy, and is more like a thud than the &quot;crack&quot; of a rifle. This is the noise of the rifle itself, the only sound one hears if standing at the firing point. In a continued fire, the noise of the rifle is never heard, the crash of the passing bullets drowning the sound of far away rifles. The difference in the time of the two sounds is because the bullet travels much faster than sound. Noise progresses at the rate of about 1,100 feet per second. The Springfield bullet takes but 1.10 seconds to travel 700 yards, a mean speed therefore of 1,900 feet per second. The bullet is therefore quite a bit ahead of the rifle sound at all ranges until the falling off in bullet speed allows the steadily traveling rifle report to catch up. This happens at about 1,700 yards, but it is doubtful if the sound of the rifle would be heard at this distance save under favorable conditions. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly.  </p>

<p>With those people who most likely have never experienced incoming fire, it&#39;s confusing the first time. Add the confusion coupled with the eventual realization of what&#39;s happening, absolute nightmare.  </p>

<p>What&#39;s got me wondering, is why.  There&#39;s always a why.  Ideological, religious, political, money, mental instability, or any number of things I haven&#39;t thought of.  </p>

<p>After all the folks that did a pretty damn good job of trying to kill me in the &#39;Stan, I at least understood why.  I don&#39;t fault them for that. It is what it is. </p>

<p>This though just doesn&#39;t make sense to me. There&#39;s no &quot;why&quot;. At least not yet.  </p>

<p>I like your attitude. </p>

<p>As for the why...IF it is the guy they say, could be many reasons including gambling debt anger, cultural anger, dementia, or pharmaceutical side effects. It happens. Also his dad was a convicted bank robber so i wouldn&#39;t discount organic genetic reasons. </p>

<p>Then again, could be a false flag operation, so...who the hell knows. Im waiting for the video tape of him coming in and out of the hotel and room 20 times to move guns and ammo. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not so sure about this. I don&#39;t think this info is in the public yet but it might still exist. 62 year olds don&#39;t maintain the internet presence younger people think is common. I think we will have to wait for his family to be interviewed before we will know that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We won&#39;t know much about the weapons till they are released but a lot of your points seem to be misinformed. </p>

<p>Say this was an AR, you can convert it to accept belts belts of ammo or get a couple 100 round mags. This would give you plenty of ammo without having to reload as much. Either way, there were a lot of breaks in fire so it could have been jams or him reloading, the world may never know. </p>

<p>I am not convinced it was a straight forward automatic. It was more than likely a trigger crank or some sort of a bump stock. It&#39;s hard to tell due to all the low quality audio attached to the videos. There&#39;s also a lot of paperwork behind getting a full auto. Again, we will just have to wait and see.</p>

<p>If you think that just because he is old he can&#39;t shoot then you are out of your mind. Also, those people were cramped together and it&#39;s very much possible for rounds to pierce multiple people. He had all the money in the world to buy whatever rounds he was wanted too. </p>

<p>I saw that crank video someone else posted. The way that guy was shooting the crank, he could only hold it without aiming, just pointing. And he was a LOT closer to that little target and most important, straight shooting. Imagine trying to steady that rifle <em>while aiming down</em>, spraying and cranking at the same time.</p>

<p>For a really long long time. I want to see autopsy photos to see if his shoulders were damaged from all that recoil.</p>

My iron sight AR can hit 100 yards no problem and the recoil is almost negligible. If I bump stocked it with 100 round drums aiming wouldn&#39;t even be a priority into a crowd that size. My issue is the lack of motive and information pertaining to the gunman along with audio clips sounding like 2 guns at once.

    <div class="md"><p>Watch an learn a bit. Reliable, and not difficult on full auto.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSizVpfqFtw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSizVpfqFtw</a>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xtkVYsIzSc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xtkVYsIzSc</a>   (yes it&#39;s suppressed(longer discussion on recoil), but it&#39;s still a 60+ yr old man on full auto)</p>

<p>&quot;Ok I give you the first 30 round magazine as &quot;fish in a barrel&quot; but once people start to scatter it would get tougher. These are nearly 300 yd shots.&quot;</p>

<p>Without seeing enough footage, any number of things could have happened. People may have froze and laid down, people could have tripped/fallen and been trampled, and exit points could have been restricted..</p>

<p>&quot;Every 30 rounds or so you have to stop, drop your mag, reinsert mag, rack the weapon and then reaquire targets. To fire 600 rounds he has to do this 20 times. If he had an AR I am sure he had a jam or 2.&quot;</p>

<p>Ak-47&#39;s have 75(ish) drum mags, many are reliable. Ar-15&#39;s have 60 round magpul drums and 60 round surefire mag, the magpul drums are very reliable in my experience. If they were standard 30(or even 40&#39;s) they are often taped together and you can change the mag is a couple seconds.
Regarding jamming, depends on the rifle, ammo quality and how clean/what type of lube he used. Ar-15&#39;s aren&#39;t jam prone unless it&#39;s a pos rifle.</p>

<p>&quot; Even dropping the spent weapon and grabbing another loaded one still takes time and causes you to reaquire targets that were almost 3 football fields away, at night with all of the extra light of vegas&quot;</p>

<p>Magnification, a 1-4 or 3-9 would make this relatively easy if your not going for precision(head shots, etc) heck even with irons I can hit a man size gong at 300 yards. Maybe he had a table in front of the window(or dragged a dresser) and used it as a make-shift rifle bench. </p>

<p>300 yards, really isn&#39;t all that difficult with a rifle, especially one with  a good optic. My Gf was able to hit 16&quot;gongs at 200 yards on her first time shooting my Ar-15. </p>

<pre><code>&quot;Shooting a full auto weapon is hard. The recoil alone would make these shots nearly impossible. Even shooting in bursts or in semi auto mode. Trained military could prob do it with difficulty. Joe Blow 64 year old psychopath? Nope. Why do you think military snipers shoot bolt action rifles???
</code></pre>

<p>Depends on the weapon, an AK-47 is a mofo on full auto, an Ar-15 is quite easy.
Military snipers use bolt actions because they are shooting for precision(Ie head, or heart), and also distances further than 300 yards. I do agree that full auto is very difficult to shoot accurately, especially at such distances, but if your just dumping mags into a crowd, your bound to hit something.</p>

<p>&quot; If this untrained psycho got 600 hits from 300 yds away at night, how many shots would he have had to shoot??? At best he would have hit 1/3, and that is generous. So he needed to shoot the guns 1800 times minimum in what? 20 minutes? 90 rounds a minute, 3 reloads per min. ( which btw is not consistent with reported full auto fire) All while maintaining accuracy from distance with no formal training.&quot;</p>

<p>8(30) rnd mags=240 rounds  in 1 minute(start 2:13) he continues to fire 800+ rounds from one gun in full auto without malfunction until the gun explodes at the end. So if he had several Ar&#39;s easily done. He fired 830 rounds in 6 minutes from 1 gun. At the rate he fired( 8  mags in 6 minutes) until the gun exploded he could have shot 2700+ rounds in 20 minutes, possible more if he was switching guns, as they wouldn&#39;t be so hot and therefore easier to handle.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSizVpfqFtw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSizVpfqFtw</a></p>

<p>&quot;The numbers do not add up.&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s isn&#39;t clear if The 500-ish wounded were gun shot related. Many of those could have been people who tripped, were trampled etc.. We don&#39;t know the cause or extent of their injuries.</p>

<p>Because the people were standing very close to each other in a small proximity, could the bullets travel through victims. So hitting two people with 1 bullet? I know its possible but is it likely when the shooter is that far away?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude watch the videos, it happens exactly like that... except the scattering is not really there.  Peopel are tryiing to scatter but the whole time there are still areas where there are seas of people, and he just fires off rounds fully auto then takes a while in between reloading, then just keeps going again.  Also I&#39;m not sure if he had a bunch of guns lined up or what, but there definitely seems to be a lot more than 30 shots per volley, so either the reports on the magazine size are wrong or he was rotating through guns one by one then reloading.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can you link any that have the sound of 2 weapons being fired? The first on released you could hear bad echos and richoceets but when you link them up with the other videos it&#39;s pretty clear it&#39;s only a single weapon. Also there is not overlap from one weapon running empty and the reload time suggests a single shorter with 1 weapon. If he did use a crank or bump stock he would of needed 2 hands. So IMO and it&#39;s just my opioine supported my evidence that it was a single weapon. Now he could of changed guns when he started to over heat it but I think that is different then firing 2 guns at once. </p>

To make it to NyNy while injured is a pretty big walk. They had to pass Luxor, Excalibur, cross the street and then walk up to Nyny. That is a whole lot of walking or running to do while injured. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I live in Las Vegas. The distance from the venue to NYNY is less than a half mile. In Las Vegas at least the city blocks are measured in half miles. Terrorist attacks come in a wide variety. It is best to just keep running the full 2 miles just in case it is a gas attack, they have placed explosives, there are multiple shooters, etc.. It is not surprising at all that people ended up just 2000 ft away.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I apologize for the rudeness but it angers me when people not only put so little effort into their positions on important issues but also actively undermine the truth with false claims, assumptions, and faulty reasoning.</p>

<p>We are on r/conspiracy. A vast quantity of these conspiracies are due to people not using rational analysis of the problem, jumping to conclusions without adequate evidence, then letting their own confirmation bias block any counter evidence of their assumptions. Your post is questioning the fact that injured people ended up at NYNY as if it were some lie to support a conspiracy due to the incredulity fallacy. Then you used the distance as some sort of justification for this new narrative as evidence that injured people would be unlikely to make it that far. To top it off you just admitted you didn&#39;t know were the venue is which demonstrates that no effort was put into your argument. </p>

<p>I just want to people be better, put thought and effort into their positions, and stop foisting their irrational thoughts onto the world. Pipe dream I know but a fight worth doing anyway.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t make my stance clear. My point was that it is was unlikely that someone ended up at nyny. Basically, I feel it was a false report in the midst of the confusion. There is zero doubt in my mind that this event happened. There may be more than meets the eye as to who or how many did it. Having fleed a shooter before...I ran to the closet place. I&#39;m no authority on it tho. Are there official reports about nyny? I didn&#39;t mean to imply there was a shooter there. I just didn&#39;t find it likely that someone would run that far out in the open with gunfire coming from an unknown location. Closest building seems more likely. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In the aftermath of shootings this place always gets worse and even simple and verifiable facts are lied about. People that were shot in the arm for instance can run a long way on adrenaline alone. Panic causes blind fleeing and irrational actions. Even if there are more rational alternatives that doesn&#39;t exclude the possibility that people chose an irrational one regardless. People even choose irrational things regularly in everyday choices with no pressure at all.</p>

<p>As for a more clear answer to whether there were injured at NYNY, yes. Ambulances were dispatched to NYNY. Many still mobile injured people did flee that far before stopping. There was no shooter there. All of the reports of shooters in other areas were attributed to echos and the canyon like buildings on the strip.</p>

<p>two different guns firing at the same time</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;re hearing an echo that&#39;s happening in conjunction with bullets ricocheting. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>he never had prior weapon experience</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s incorrect, he owned handguns (at a minimum) prior to the stockpile he began with the heavier guns.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why did the shooter need to break two different windows in two adjacent rooms at Mandalay Bay to shoot at one target</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He didn&#39;t have a target, he was literally just spraying into a crowd of people. If you&#39;ve seen a setup of the room-type, it&#39;s a very large room. The windows used both have slightly different angles. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>we heard shots fired on the scanner last night after they found the suspect dead.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This happens with so many active shooter situations. Things get incredibly confusing because of how hectic the scenes are. They&#39;re overly cautious until it&#39;s 100% confirmed that the thread is eliminated. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Suspect was fully accurate firing from 320 feet up across a street from a casino</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He was absolutely nowhere near &quot;fully accurate&quot;, he was just spraying into a crowd.</p>

<p>I will say the weirdest thing about this is that the guy has not even been pulled over for a traffic violation by the police. He meticulously planned this massacre, from choosing his room to setting up for 3 days. We&#39;ll know more if/when a motive is released.</p>

<p>This is the agenda that is being pushed: </p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Any normal guy is a potential maniac.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The public has realized that ISIS or other extremism is easily avoided by a society being xenophobic, thus no need for getting the state to keep you safe. Case in point: the election of Trump. You avoid the issue of Mexicans being over represented in crime statistics by not having Mexicans over in the first place. No more Boston bombings? Solution: no Muslims. Etc... </p>

<p>By making the boogeyman &quot;a normal guy&quot; the public will instead seek out the state for protection. The goal: disarming and removing the rights of the population. Expect widespread bans on &quot;assault&quot; weapons and implementation of draconian surveillance laws. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>during the boston &quot;bombing&quot; they had a large cast of crisis actors and no one was hurt.  they used an arsenal of blood packs, already had paraplegics in their cast, and a hard-working costume detail crew.  a lot of work, but no one was hurt.  it&#39;s easier to just hurt them, but less moral</p>

<p>but back on vegas:  i did recently see a pic of some of the bodies (from a distance).  looked fairly believable</p>

<p>at this point for me it&#39;s a matter of figuring out who was actually responsible</p>

<p>They have control of who gets into the concert, so they just give tickets to their actors.  I guess the first responders and hospitals would have to be paid as well.  Maybe a budget of a few million for actors and extras.  I&#39;m not saying that is what happened, but it hypothetically could have, and I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s even illegal if it did.  The main problem with this theory is everyone keeping quiet about it.</p>

<p>That is a subversively fallacious comment. The goal is to deviate from the official story within reason. He is literally just reinforcing the official story. Thus it is not a &quot;different viewpoint&quot; - it&#39;s currently THE viewpoint. r/conspiracy&#39;s job is to be the dissenting viewpoint.</p>

He is convinced that they don&#39;t try to frivolously claim ownership of things they didn&#39;t do. Remember back when 9/11 happened, Bin Laden immediately distanced himself from the attacks. From what I can tell, there&#39;s not much to be gained from a publicity/propaganda standpoint (at least from ISIS&#39;s perspective).

(<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/national/mass-shootings-in-america/">source</a>). This doesn&#39;t happen anywhere else. The problem with the current gun restriction laws is that they aren&#39;t consistent. Yeah, I can&#39;t get a gun very easily in Chicago, but all I have to do is drive to Indiana where I don&#39;t need a permit. The laws we have do not work, and as soon as you bring up anything having to do with regulating firearms, swaths of people begin foaming at the mouth.</p>

<p>Every hotel room in there, they can&#39;t have cameras in the room, its a gross invasion of privacy. He was in a room, so I don&#39;t see how any security or anything would have spotted any of this. People keep on mentioning &quot;how did the hotel/security/someone not know about this?&quot; the answer is dead simple: he walked in like a normal person then when he got into his room. I don&#39;t see this as being hard to comprehend. </p>

<p>Now there <em>definitely</em> should be camera footage from the hallways so that we can see if and when SWAT/police came in but I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll never see that footage.</p>

<p>Also footage of Paddock in the lobby and checking in and how much baggage he had with him or if he left and re-entered with more. Definitive proof that he was in fact the actual shooter and acted entirely alone. If all of what needs to fit in that scenario doesn&#39;t sound quite like a 64 year old retiree who leads the kind of relaxed and easy going lifestyle in which he goes to Vegas every so often to drink and play the slots to break up the monotony of the quiet community of retirees he lives in, then you&#39;re right, it doesn&#39;t. </p>

<p>Breaking-out huge floor to ceiling windows thirty floors up and perching at the very edge of them in order to shoot out of them is in itself a pretty damned scary and intimidating task that far too many seem to think would be easy without ever bothering to consider if they&#39;d ever have enough nerve to attempt that over three hundred feet up from the ground or stand or kneel on the very edge of it to fire down into the street.</p>

<p>There&#39;s only so much you can write off to someone going off the deep end which is only explanation being offered for what is an extremely cold-blooded and methodical bit of work to not get actually get tripped-up and foiled before the grand finale in which you shoot yourself rather taking as many cops with you before they knock you off if killing as many people as you possibly can is your sole motive and you don&#39;t give a damn about your own life.  </p>

<p>This isn&#39;t something I can envision some 64 year losing his shit and doing or ever succeeding with. For me only a trained professional would have the confidence and experience to ever be up to pulling something like that off, not someone who&#39;s never done anything like it before who in all likelihood would never think of doing it, or have no way to know if they could do it or succeed in doing it when faced with it, either. It&#39;s the stuff of guerilla and street combat set in a modern city of high rise structures. Not so familiar on this side of the world but with plenty of it that&#39;s gone on in the Middle-East with both US military and mercenaries being well versed with both encountering and using those very tactics, themselves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As far as everyone is concerned with him hauling luggage and ammo, it&#39;s super fucking easy for him to sneak it in. He doesn&#39;t need massive long bags he could easily stash 10 guns, broken down, into a normal suitcase. He wasn&#39;t there on the concert grounds pulling the guns out of a bag and shooting he was supposedly there for something like a few weeks and the entirety of the weekend allegedly scoping it out. So all he had to do was take the guns apart stash them in a suit case and rebuild them in the room, he wasn&#39;t in a rush, he was patient. How many people go through those casinos with big boxes of camera equipment daily? or golf bags, or more than one suitcase. How many people are in and out daily sometimes with bags sometimes without, that&#39;s almost impossible to keep an eye on.</p>

<p>As far as sound i&#39;m not sold it was multiple shooters although I am seeing some videos now showing flashes from the 4th floor. I say I&#39;m not sold yet because sound bounces. The gun shot sounds will travel and bounce off of other surfaces creating the alleged multiple shooter scenario a shot sound coming the from the left at some good distance away could potentially hit a wall or building and sound like it&#39;s now coming from behind especially with the delay in sound travel. </p>

<p>Look do I buy a lone shooter scenario? Not entirely. do I believe it is plausible he somehow did on this on his own? it&#39;s entirely plausible regardless of his age or background. At that point he&#39;s shooting fish in a barrel and I&#39;m more surprised the death toll isn&#39;t higher</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The last report I heard they said he checked in Saturday, meaning the day before. Not a great deal of time, if that is so. I have no idea why there are so many conflicting reports about so many aspects of this right from the very get-go. </p>

<p>The windows and him breaking them out at that height, is as I said, more important than I think most believe. Something that very few people could bring themselves to do. </p>

<p>The whole idea of a high rise ambush strikes me as a highly unusual thing to think of or do in the manner that this one was carried out. </p>

<p>It&#39;s one thing to open a window and fire out of it with relative safety quite another to create a huge hole you could easily fall out of simply trying to make and then having to position yourself at very edge of it to shoot. I&#39;m not talking about acrophobia or any unreasonable fear of heights but rather the most common kind that would disincline the vast majority of people from ever attempting it or ever getting as close to that opening as was necessary in this case. </p>

<p>Oddly enough any attempts to bring that up or simply point it out has run into far more resistance and derisive comments than I can count. </p>

<p>The inordinate push for the official line and to close down any notions that there may be more to this than meets the eye on this of all forums should be enough to convince most of the regulars that something out of the ordinary is definitely up with it.  </p>

<p>They say he broke out the window, but he could have just as easily cut a small hole in the window with a glass cutter and stick the barrel through. Even if he did break the whole window, why would he have to get out on the ledge? Do you not understand how a bi-pod works? All he would have had to do was put the bi-pod on the window sill and let her rip.</p>

Imagine yourself in a room 30 stories up with a 6&#39; x 10&#39; floor to ceiling hole that the breeze is blowing in and in order to aim downwards as the shooter did you&#39;d have to get very close to that open edge. There is no sill or ledge there is only the edge of the floor of that room with a 300&#39; sheer drop on the other side of it and that&#39;s nothing compared to the danger in trying to bash it out, chunk by chunk in the first place.</p>

<p>Just to play a little devils advocate.  It would not be hard or conspicuous to break down whatever weapon(s) he used and bring them in to the hotel up to his room in a suitcase or backpack.  In fact if you had a large suitcase like you would take on a plane you could very easily break down the weapons and cart them in the suitcase upstairs with no one knowing.  </p>

<p>Ammunition he could have bought locally and very similarly brought upstairs in a backpack or suitcase unnoticed.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s not as if he had a blunderbuss or something.</p>

<p>I have no assertion of anything nor do I prescribe any theory I&#39;m simply saying that it is very possible to bring multiple weapons up to a hotel room unnoticed if you know how to break down a weapon.</p>

<p>I think if there was any general consensus before that it would have been people in turbans, sandals, and flowing garments with plenty of camels parked around as they haggled in tented street-markets, not a scene that could be in the very heart of any of the best cities in the US or anywhere else for that matter. A modern city that is now in tatters with pitched gun-battles suddenly erupting and bombs going off. Not soft, but naïve with a stilted view and too little knowledge about a world beyond US borders they&#39;ve grown up believing is vastly inferior to their own in every possible way. </p>

<p>Well, if it was a false flag operation it was done by the deep state (or something like that). Since they control the government, how really difficult would it actually be? Most people still believe the official narrative of 911, so I would guess it&#39;s not that hard.</p>

<p>I think it would be more like they control the police, or what &quot;part&quot; (department, whatever you want to name it) of the police will investigate it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It doesn&#39;t work that way, that the police are all &#39;in on it.&#39; They&#39;re not, they don&#39;t have to be. What happens is that someone higher up gets pressured by someone who is in on it, someone who has authority, or has leverage on the higher up. The higher up then takes the evidence collected by the junior officers and tells them he/she will take care of it, comes back and tells them they were mistaken, or the evidence showed something else, or just doesn&#39;t mention it again. Any junior officers who get worried about this and speak up get told to shut up, their job is threatened. If they push it, then depending on the circumstances they&#39;re blackmailed/their life or family is threatened. Some of them occasionally speak up, maybe in the first chaos they say something to the media, but it never gets replayed on TV again so people forget about it in the mainstream. Or they don&#39;t get media coverage, and they end up doing an interview or two with alternative media (this is if they&#39;re ok to lose their job) and then people dismiss them and call it fake news.</p>

<p>This happens time and time again. I&#39;ve heard testimony from cops investigating various things who have been silenced in one way or another, another way is if they ask too many questions they get taken off the case, moved to another department etc.</p>

<p>The hierarchical nature of law enforcement and the fact that they generally only employ people with an average or below average IQ - i.e. people who are happy to follow orders and assume the higher ups have good reasons without questioning, helps with this. You can look up cases where people who tested too highly were refused from employment with the police force.</p>

I don&#39;t know for sure, but from what I heard on the news and radio is that they breached the room and found the suspect dead from suicide wound.

I&#39;ve been to Vegas several times and there isn&#39;t an inch of public space that isn&#39;t being recorded at all time.

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s possible it could have all been brought up in 1 or maybe 2 trips on a luggage cart at a minimum. My guess would be 2, since if you stacked heavy luggage high on one of those carts, your center of gravity would make the cart prone to tip over. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think as a hotel employee, I would be too suspicious seeing someone loading up a cart full of bags unless I was the person that checked them in. To any other person you could easily assume that it&#39;s a husband bringing up luggage for their family. Even if I was the one to check him in, I don&#39;t think any kind of alarm bells would be ringing. I mean he could be a dude who brought a bunch of old stuff he wanted to get on pawnstars with. Typically Vegas hotel employees want to make you as comfortable as possible and want to offer you every courtesy to incentivise you to stay with them again. Not to mention, this isn&#39;t the kind of person people would generally profile.</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t read anywhere how he had arrived at the hotel yet, but if he drove, the footage from where he unloaded his luggage should show the tail end of the car rise an inch or 2. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t either! I&#39;m thinking a cover-up.</p>

<p>Maybe we found out too late that there was a group of terrorists/shooters? Maybe we&#39;d look foolish because we&#39;d previously been watching them, keeping tabs on their travel, etc. and yet they got away with this? So the official story is, we got the one guy who did it all, when maybe five guys got away with it and I&#39;d be inclined, then, to also believe that Paddock may be a patsy, placed in that room and killed (or part of the group, plans unknown to him, he&#39;s killed and left to be found by police as the only fall-guy) and the US govt. can hold their heads high and say we couldn&#39;t have prevented it. I really do believe there were many more than one shooter. There have yet to be any videos in the casinos of Paddock moving weapons in. Logically you&#39;d assume someone else helped him? I&#39;m curious if he&#39;s our center of attention, but a loose-end in the real, true story of what happened, and he got tied up to make this look nice and simple. 
Single, active shooter turns the gun on himself, when he could&#39;ve easily made an effort to escape? Millions of dollars and nothing to do but practice hobbies on his multiple properties? Seems like the same guy who would get bored enough to get sucked into plans he wasn&#39;t fully aware of.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, if he shot for 10-12 minutes and the cops did not get into the room for 72 minutes, that would have left him quite a bit of time to try to get away or try to kill more people. Also, a couple of the articles I read said that they were unsure if the cameras were streaming. If that is still unconfirmed it makes me think that they did not find a laptop or something in his room where he would have been monitoring them from</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great post, my only issue is that shooting into a crowd roughly 200-300 yards away (as the bullet flies) and killing tons of people the way we saw (i.e. the 10 second full auto bursts) just takes a drum magazine, an automatic weapon and some basic gun knowledge (which is almost certain given the first two).</p>

<p>It&#39;s not like he was picking targets and eliminating them, he was just spewing bullets into a sea of people. To me I don&#39;t see where the military experience is needed. That being said every other point you mentioned is solid evidence for me that we don&#39;t have the full story.</p>

<p>I still believe he could be a patsy and am almost certain he wasn&#39;t a lone wolf which is the important part. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Shots fired over police scanner after suspect found dead.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We&#39;re basing this off one guy trying to recall the order of events on a police scanner that he listened to for several hours straight 24 hours ago. He even said this: &quot;I do not have an accurate timeline on this, actually, I just remembered. This had to be before 11:00pm.&quot; Convincing.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Multiple full auto weapons can be heard overlapping each other when fired on video</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From the echo of the buildings, to the fact that bullets break the sound barrier, to the explanation that he might&#39;ve just been firing two guns simultaneously, this is not good evidence. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The suspect had no experience, background, or anything to do with weapons/military</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As other have said, he&#39;s shooting into a crowd of thousands. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>It took hours to evacuate a theatre inside a casino that was already considered &quot;secure&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Perhaps you don&#39;t want over 1000 drunk traumatized people rushing out when police and medics are trying to get a handle on the situation?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Suspect was fully accurate firing from 320 feet up across a street from a casino</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, crowd of people.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Victims found in New York New York, Mandalay Bay, Route 91, and Aria but shots fired only at Mandalay Bay</p>
</blockquote>

<p>First, people can continue to move after being shot if its not fatal. Second, people often carry victims to safety. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying todays facts fits our cliche model of what usually &quot;makes sense&quot; in these circumstances, perhaps something weird is going on, but this guy&#39;s story is not proving a damn thing.</p>

There&#39;s next to no chance that these weapons were legally purchased as full-auto.  Meaning someone modified them to be full-auto.  You would have to have a serious interest in firearms to gather the knowledge to convert them to full auto (and have them cycle reliably).

<p>where are you getting that they were full auto? They weren&#39;t. They were semi-auto with after market mods which are legal to purchase but in a grey area when fitting onto a gun. The sound in the vids isn&#39;t full auto is too slow. </p>

<p>This idea seems to be coming from the interview with the brother whom he hadn&#39;t spoken to in 6months and even then it was minimal by text, so I&#39;m not really all that sure brother knows him that well.  And clearly he had an interest in guns since he had dozens and had previously taken his nieces and nephews skeet shooting at one point. A new found interest in guns and it wouldn&#39;t take very long to get up to speed on types of weapons and mods.

I also heard he was there since Thursday night, but I can&#39;t be 100% positive. If they were just saying this to make it seem like what you&#39;re saying then it could be plausible.

    <div class="md"><p>Here is another thing to consider;</p>

<p>The Tropicana has clear line of sight to the room of the shooter(s?) The closest point at the Tropicana to the Mandalay Bay is approximately 660 meters away. Assuming 10 ft per floor, that means the highest point at the Tropicana was approximately 100 ft lower than the room with the blown out windows.</p>

<p>That means there was a comfortable 5.1 degree vertical tangent from the Tropicana to the Mandalay Bay. The standard issue police M24 has an effective range of approximately 900 yards. The shooting went on for approximately 72 minutes.</p>

<p>Where the fuck was SWAT that entire time?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just my two cents, but what sounds like two different guns in all the videos I&#39;ve seen sounds like it&#39;s two sounds from one gun: The more poppy type more muffled sounds would be the sound of the shells firing in the gun and the more crackly sound would be the sonic boom of the bullets flying through the air. The bullets travel faster than sound and at that distance I&#39;d expect you&#39;d hear the cracking sound of the actual bullets slightly before the sounds of the gun actually going off because the sound comes from a shorter distance. Add in some massive buildings with a bunch of flat angled surfaces and one full auto or crank fire gun would easily sound like 3 or 4 guns going off. Not trying to poke holes in your version of events but just offering an explanation of why the gunshots sound like a bunch of guns when heard on videos taken from the ground and especially at a distance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He was definitely not using sub-sonic rounds, so yes, the rounds themselves would make a whizzing or cracking sound, dependent upon a person’s proximity to said rounds (source: have been shot at on multiple occasions). </p>

<p>Another explanation for the perception of hearing multiple weapons: echoes. Several other high rise buildings in the immediate vicinity of the attack. Echoes of the gunshots reverberating off the other buildings would make it sound like a second weapon was firing, especially with the delay and slight distortion of sound. </p>

<p>Whatever actually happened, you don&#39;t want to just let a terrified crowd go and spread more panic. It is wise to let everyone calm down,  make sure everyone has been basically attended to and properly interviewed. Also, great time to work on highly suggestable scared people in a closed room. I wonder what exactly was happening during that time and weather everyone was given a sedative of some sort. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Suspect was fully accurate? Uh, as a former machine gunner in the Marine Corps, it does NOT take much accuracy when firing into a large target area at that distance. It was a large concert, with a lot of people in attendance over a large area. The guy wasn’t using a bolt action rifle to pick people off one by one.</p>

<p>What this guy supposedly did is what us machine gunners would call enfilade fire, which is when the cone of fire (where the rounds are impacting), coincide or nearly coincides with the long axis of the target. Basically meaning you’re entire “impact area” is completely encompassed with your target. It’s a machine gunner’s wet dream. </p>

<p>Had this guy had military training, especially in regards to proper employment of machine guns and automatic weapons (PICMDEEP), this could have been WAY worse than it is. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Easily. Bushmaster, what, maybe 4lbs? Glock 9mm, somewhere near a pound? How many magazines and how much ammo? Doesn’t take a lot to do the amount of damage he inflicted. </p>

<p>100 rounds of 7.62x51mm weighs roughly 7lbs. 5.56 rounds, being smaller, weigh a little less. He could easily carry the rifle, the glock, and (8) 30 round magazines (240 rounds in total) and easily be under 30lbs worth of total extra weight. Manageable, especially if the magazines are spread loaded using an LBV or some other sort of equipment. Hell, if he was wearing cargo pants/shorts, that’s one mag in the rifle, one mag per pocket, and one mag left over just for the AR. </p>

<p>112lbs is pretty scrawny, yes, but 30lbs isn’t much, especially if you’ve psyched yourself up and have adrenaline flowing. </p>

<p>But no, from what I have heard in the videos I’ve seen, the pauses between bursts/volleys was way too long, whether it be reloading, switching weapons, or trying to perform immediate/remedial action to clear or a jam or weapon malfunction with a single weapon. </p>

<p>Either this guy was in no hurry, and was just slowly and methodically taking each step in his plan, or he was having a lot of issues with weapons handling. </p>

<p>Single weapon, well trained, dropping and empty mag and inserting a new one should take less than a second (watch the movie Heat, Val Kilmer, man, that guy spent a lot of time practicing speed reloads, pretty damn good for an actor). Swapping weapons, that should be just as quick as quick as reloading a mag into a single weapon. Reloading a belt fell weapon? 2 seconds max if well trained and rehearsed and no fumbles with the belt (it happens). Immediate/remedial action to clear a jam or weapon malfunction... that varies dependent on the problem, but if it was severe enough, why not toss it aside and grab one of the many other weapons laying around?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very plausible that they found him quickly via the fire alarm. Like the other guy said, the amount of smoke coming from firing that many rounds in an enclosed space would easily set the alarms off, and with high rises, I would imagine most fire detection systems would let management and the fire department know exactly where the detector is that initially went off. I haven’t heard all of the Sheriff’s updates, but somebody said he mentioned that it was a security guard and neighboring rooms that called in and that’s how they located him. </p>

<p>As for the two firing positions, I don’t think he moved to a second spot because he thought it was a better spot. This guy planned this pretty well. He most likely knew that the first gun would either overheat or malfunction, so he had a second firing positions already set up at a different location with a tripod or whatever type of fire support set up he had. When the first gun went down, he moved to the second set-up and recommenced his carnage. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>People are speculating that he had an AK or other 7.62x39 clone with a bump fire stock and a 100 round drum. If that&#39;s the case, they are known to jam with some frequency and really are a pain in the ass to fix if you are not intimately familiar with them.  I make no claims as to what he was using, but if he was indeed using what the rumor mill suggests, this is plausible.</p>

<p>Personally it sounded like a belt fed to me, until I heard the part where it was speeding up and slowing down. They don&#39;t do that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. The echoes are amplified to an even higher degree in an urban environment, which makes things rather complicated. </p>

<p>We had the displeasure of trying to figure out which murder hole in which compound incoming fire was coming from. The better guys would sit back a few feet from the hole so you wouldn’t be able to see the smoke, and unless they were shooting directly at you, you wouldn’t be able to see the muzzle flash. Made locating the source of incoming rounds difficult. </p>

<p>I am not trained in firearms or anything, but that video clearly shows two different shooters. One is closer and the other is farther away. The reason i say this is because in the beginning you can hear the loud close fire, followed by what seems to be an echo. The a few seconds later you hear more echo, but it&#39;s longer than the original fire. Then again a few seconds after the distance shots reign for longer than before. Then again you hear the close up fire. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Easily could’ve been anywhere between 100-200 dead if the killer had basic training in machine gun employment. During the first volley of two, all of the victims are packed in pretty tight and clueless as to what was going on. Most impacts during that timeframe would’ve been to a person’s upper torso or head, greatly increasing the chances of a wound being fatal. </p>

<p>After people started hunkering down like you see in a lot of the videos could’ve also been quite devastating had this guy been well trained. At that range, with proper employment, it would be pretty easy to keep your beaten zone (area of impact) within a 5 foot diameter. Several controlled bursts into the various huddled groups would’ve increased the fatality rate greatly. </p>

<p>Best method of employment for a light or medium machine gun would be with a 2 man team, in the probe, using a tripod and T&amp;E, with sandbags or something similar providing added support to the legs of the tripod. The second man would be halfway laying on top of the gunner to provide extra support and control of recoil, and can also assist with reloading, performing immediate/remedial action in the event of a malfunction, and can also help coordinate the fire and make adjustments after viewing the impacts. </p>

<p>Would look somewhat like <a href="https://media.defense.gov/2011/Nov/12/19048/-1/-1/0/111112-M-0000A-001.jpg">this</a>  sans the sandbags</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know this is pretty gruesome to hear, but there is a reason it sounds like multiple gunmen and additional pops between shots.  I live in rural GA.  Aka, we do a lot of hunting.  One of the first things you will learn when hearing someone close by (within about 1000 yards) shoot a deer or other large game is there is a distinct &quot;thump-boom&quot; when a round hits.  This happens bc the bullet it traveling faster than the speed of sound and you are actually hearing it hit meat before you are hearing it leave the rifle.  It&#39;s terrible, but having listened to quite a few videos, I only heard 1 shooter.  That being said, he was also cranking out 30-50 rounds in under 10 seconds.  (Seems like I heard a gun or type of magazine change)</p>

<p>Suspect was fully accurate firing from 320 feet up across a street from a casino</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s 320 feet if he was firing straight down. My guess is his targets were ~250 yards away. It&#39;s pretty hard to shoot 500 people even if there is a crowd that far away. I would imagine the floor of his hotel room would be covered in shell casings. You would guest in adjacent rooms above, below, and next to him would have called in to report the gunfire.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This. It was like I was hearing a completely different record of events on the scanner compared to what what on the news. Many things that have not been addressed or even considered in the &quot;official report&quot;:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>reports of a shots fired from the gate 7 at the festival. (Theres video showing shots firing from the mandalay bay and much louder shots that sound much closer. The video looks like its near a exit at the festival)</p></li>
<li><p>reports of a someone shot at nyny (could have just been someone from the festival)</p></li>
<li><p>the scanner reports say there were shots from the 19th(?) and 32nd floor</p></li>
<li><p>reports of police chasing a man and woman in the casino(could just be hysteria)</p></li>
<li><p>reports of a gray(or black?) car speeding away from the mandalay bay casino? </p></li>
<li><p>reports of people running on the runway at the airport?</p></li>
<li><p>eyewitness on the news claiming a woman was in the crowd at the concert saying everyone was going to die. This was 45 mins before the shooting started(according to her)</p></li>
<li><p>another eyewitness claiming there were shooters on the festival grounds shooting and herding people away from the exits.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>So thats a lot of stuff. Some seems easily attributed to hysteria and incorrect recollection, but some really makes you go hmm?</p>

<p>The news is making a big deal about how they cant find a motive yet and that he acted alone, but what about all these abnormalities that clash with the official story?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What people need to realize also is that the police,fbi,cia,etc etc won&#39;t tell the mass media certain things that are &quot;still on going&quot; as in they have a lead on someone but dont want to give up too much info for fear of the suspect figuring it out via coms tv etc or even in media Briefs. Hell if anything saves you more lives. Those are my thoughts....</p>

<p>Here is where it does NOT add up to me. As soon as I turned on the news I heard gunshots(around 10:20-10:25) I wish I would have recorded it. Around 10:30pm they found the shooter dead in his room. They say it&#39;s a lone wolf act but in NUMEROUS VIDEOS you can hear two different guns firing at the same time. Not only that, but the weapons they found in his room were assault rifles. 10 of them, thousands of rounds of ammo. Here&#39;s where I started to think something was wrong. Over the scanner, me and my mom VERY CLEARLY heard a 4 bullet burst. Then two different officers asked, &quot;Shots fired?&quot; Silence, 2 more burst of fully automatic fire, and another officer, &quot;Shots fired??&quot;. There was about a minute of radio static then resumed back to the normal strike team placement etc. Here&#39;s the kicker: The SWAT had already found the suspect dead in his room. I do not have an accurate timeline on this, actually, I just remembered. This had to be before 11:00pm because that&#39;s when the sheriff did the first interview with the news and it was before that.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ve been saying this to people all day. I heard the exact same thing whilst listening with my SO. Definitely happened yet no mention today of it. and it was definitely after they&#39;d breached the room on 32nd floor and said &quot;1 suspect down&quot;.</p>

<p>Bizarre and a half. There is a recording on this sub but it stops before the breach.</p>

<p>Shooting started at ~10:08, police didn&#39;t enter the guy&#39;s room until 11:20. I listened to the police scanners too -- there&#39;s recordings of them if you want to actually post them. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Nope, 2 cracks per shot. First is the bullet breaking the sound barrier, second is actual sound of the round being fired from the gun. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The suspect had no experience, background, or anything to do with weapons/military</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He worked for the weapons manufacturer that merged with Lockheed Martin. The guy literally made military grade weapons for a living. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Suspect was fully accurate firing from 320 feet up across a street from a casino</p>
</blockquote>

<p>According to firearms experts, with nearly 30,000 people packed into a 2 acre area, just spraying the area with gunfire would result in every 3rd shot hitting someone -- no aiming even needed. See article that&#39;s up on the Guardian&#39;s website. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Victims found in New York New York, Mandalay Bay, Route 91, and Aria but shots fired only at Mandalay Bay</p>
</blockquote>

<p>High-powered rifle rounds can easily travel well over a mile at sea level. NY NY is about 2500-3000 feet away from Mandalay Bay, Aria about a mile away, Route 91 is right next door. </p>

<p>Your first post sucks. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess “supposedly” was the wrong word to use unless you don’t believe the narrative. From my experience, this was well planned and calculated for his method of employment.</p>

<p>I’ve said it before in previous comments, and I’ll say again, he used what we call “enfilade fire,” which is a machine gunners wet dream. His range, his elevation, his angle of fire on the target. They were ideal for machine gun employment. I don’t know if I should be surprised or not. He had no military background, but honestly if you google “Machinegun employment” you could probably learn quite a bit. Enfilade fire and grazing fire are the most optimal methods of employment.</p>

<p>Was he trained? No. But knowing the basic principles of employment, especially on such a “prime” target, you didn’t really have to be trained in the physical sense. Had he been trained, he could’ve easily killed 2 or 3 times as many people. </p>

<p>In this scenario, and his employment, the difference of affect between a trained and an untrained individual was negligible. There’s no doubting this guy created a mass amount of damage. The difference of “effect” between an untrained and trained individual could’ve been pretty stark. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was listening to the scanner feed, I definitely heard automatic gunfire over the scanner, right around 12:00 Pacific, after the gunman had died. Immediately afterwards there were reports of shots fired at The Bellagio. Afterwards, when it was reported that there was only one shooter, I assumed maybe earlier audio of the gunshots somehow got played over the scanner. Now I have my doubts.
TL:DR : Heard shots on scanner after the shooter was killed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One of the things that puzzles me is that this guy was 64, Tom Petty passed today at 66. A 64 year old guy who didn&#39;t look too healthy in several pictures was able to load his vehicle with gear including weapons &amp; ammo which are heavy then unload at the hotel prepare and set up and still have enough energy &amp; rage to move from window to window to execute his plan.</p>

<p>This is also a guy with no military experience. Shooting is one thing but real world situations are another and that includes clearing stoppages &amp; jams in action with proficiency, finding and using onsite firing positions and firing with repetition which can be hard on the body. The military trains with repetition. I don&#39;t see a few shooting classes or some range time making this guy that proficient a soldier.</p>

<p>The second or third shooter could be the different weapons and 2nd window on the side of the room. But over lapping fire with different sounding weapons is another.  </p>

<p>Also explosives/materials found in his home, car and/or room are not being talked about too much. They get a mention but doesn&#39;t seem to be raising eyebrows.</p>

<p>Alot of issues don&#39;t make this narrative a clean one.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also monitored LVMP scanner from about 10:30 p.m. Heard suspect was &quot;down,&quot; then heard other officers whispering while going up staircases to floor, later heard suspect both &quot;down&quot; and &quot;in custody.&quot; After this, there were a dozen or more reports of other shooters in every hotel in the area: Tropicana, Bellagio, NY NY, Paris, etc. There was a Lexus SUV left at the north valet entrance of the Luxor: it appeared to have an IED with wires hanging to the ground beneath the car. Medics were supposedly fired upon at a triage area. Dispatch began openly discussing these phantom shooters as &quot;diversions.&quot; A strike team (LVMP term) would clear a hotel/casino, and as soon as they left an &quot;eyewitness report&quot; of a shooter (often a white male with black t-shirt and &quot;long rifle&quot;) would be reported. At one point there were women (three, I think) described as suspects fleeing the scene. </p>

<p>This kind of chaos and mistaken information is common in a big, ongoing crisis. But I did hear those extra shots, as OP mentioned, long after shooter was confirmed &quot;down.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is probably going to give my account away,  it at this point social media is the lowest priority. I was on the 30th floor of the Mandalay when this started. There was no overlapping gunshots, just continuous rapid fire, then single shots from a different cali er rifle then back to full auto and it felt like the gun shots just kept going on and on and on. My timeline is blurred at this point but I heard a single pop go off sometime afterwards. I called my co-worker who was 1 floor below me to see if he heard it too. I thought the shooter was in the room next to me bc the sound of the shots vibrated my walls. We both assumed that the gunman shot himself with the single pop. Then about 20 minutes later there was 2 explosions. I thought a bomb had gone off but it was later perceived that police used some kind of flash/concussion grenade or door-busting grenade. I received a call from LVPD to tell me they got the shooter shortly after (I had called 911 earlier). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was actually just about to post something like this. I have a friend who lives in Vegas and it was relayed to me last night that there were reports of multiple shooters in multiple casinos and locations. Also, the airport was shut down (don&#39;t know about currently). Why would they shut down the airport unless there was a flight risk or the possibility of attacks on planes if they are so sure he was a &quot;lone wolf&quot;?</p>

</blockquote>

<p>To add to this; while I&#39;m not really a gun nut, someone on Zero Hedge mentioned that the gun used was a belt-fed M60.  Apparently the BATF gets very excited if civilians have those unmodified; you&#39;re only allowed to have them in semi-auto mode.  This makes sense, because the gunfire I heard in the vids I&#39;ve listened to sounded like four round bursts with small intervals; and I had thought the definition of full-auto was that you could essentially just hold down on the trigger until you either run out of ammo or the barrel melts, whichever comes first.</p>

<p>I&#39;m going to assume that something as powerful as an M60 has an exceptionally nasty recoil, which would require stabilisation.  I have no idea about real life, but in the computer games I&#39;ve played at least, you generally want to carry both a sniper rifle and an assault rifle, because assault rifles are not good for long range work.</p>

<p>If I had to guess, I&#39;m assuming that the point of this was not a precision hit against specific intended targets.  The point was just to rain down a heap of very high callibre rounds hitting random people at long vertical range, and scare the crap out of everyone there, and subsequently those who heard about it.</p>

<p>I also can&#39;t see someone whose brother claimed they had no interest in guns, using a heavy assault rifle; and especially not attempting to use one at long range.  The M60, again, also is not an easy weapon to get, legally.</p>

<p>So there&#39;s definitely something fishy about this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You think the multiple shooter scenario could have been just an echo from the three buildings around the courtyard?
Seems plausible.</p>

<p>I shake my head when I see Clinton spewing anti gun and anti NRA rhetoric in fucking tweets hours after the shooting.
Hillary Clinton has no fucking sympathy or empathy or goddamn conscience. Right away blaming &quot;silencers&quot; and &quot;full auto assault rifles&quot;. 
It&#39;s clear as day this was set up to sway public opinion on gun control. Nevada is a gun toting state, and if they can make a negative impact there, the government is one step closer to getting &quot;right wing gun enthusiasts&quot; on their side and banning guns and putting their foot down on the Right To Bear Arms.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not even American and can see this is their plan.</p>

<p>The SWAT had already found the suspect dead in his room. I do not have an accurate timeline on this, actually, I just remembered.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So you don&#39;t have a timeline on this and you have a couple of cops on the scanner not sure if shots are being fired. This isn&#39;t even worth mentioning.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There&#39;s also the suspect.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I hate this point. This is a person you know nothing about. You&#39;ve never met him, certainly not just before the shooting. You have no idea where he was in his life or what was going on. Saying he is not acting like you would expect him to act makes zero sense.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>why was there such a confusing hiatus on evacuating that Michael Jackson theatre?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If it was some conspiracy, you think they would handle these detail&#39;s pretty well. If it was a local police force dealing with something they never had before, it would make sense that it wouldn&#39;t be done perfectly. There is a much simpler explanation here.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why did the shooter need to break two different windows in two adjacent rooms at Mandalay Bay to shoot at one target? If the concert had a view, why break the second one to shoot from?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Supposedly he had two tripods. Maybe he set one gun up at one window and one at the other.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The suspect had no experience, background, or anything to do with weapons/military</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Speculation. You know nothing about this guy.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Suspect was fully accurate firing from 320 feet up across a street from a casino</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He was shooting into a crowd of 22000 people. You aim at the middle, and you&#39;ll hit people. There is no need for almost any accuracy, let alone a requirement to be &quot;fully accurate.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Victims found in New York New York, Mandalay Bay, Route 91, and Aria but shots fired only at Mandalay Bay</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You say above in your post that there were shootings there, then you have the cops saying that there were reports of shootings there, but they didn&#39;t find anything. Where is the evidence of thees victims?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When they breached the room, they reported 10 rifles, 2 tripods, and thousands of rounds of ammo. They then found the suspect with a self inflicted gunshot. </p>

<p>The reports of them finding bodies and injured was all over the police scanner, plus come to find out the victim at Aria was found there, no shots fired there, they had just ran there. I know there was bodies and injured inside of a bar at the Mandalay Bay, buddy who was working there said people just started storming in saying there was a shooter outside. Everybody came in and just hid behind stuff or fled through the casino. He also mentioned that medical never arrived on scene in Mandalay Bag until about an hour after it started, which means they secured the scene within an hour.</p>

<p>The Michael Jackson theatre I bring up because if there were that many people in there, why were they so calm when they found them in the theatre? Wouldn&#39;t those 1200 people wanna get the hell out like everyone else? What I&#39;m trying to get across here is maybe the scene was not secure and they had to delay the evacuation for there being a 2nd gunman/person. I listened as the cop found the people and reported it. He asked 3 times what he should do and was told to stay where he was. I heard all this on the scanner and that&#39;s why I&#39;m here, I heard a different story on the scanner than I did the news.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As for &quot;overlapping gunfire&quot; I offer the theory that this is just acoustic echoing. He&#39;s shooting in a metro area where there are tall buildings made of glass, and sound waves bounce around like crazy. Depending on where you&#39;re standing, it could sound like overlapping gunfire. If you listen closer, it sounds like there&#39;s the initial gunfire, then an equally as long secondary sound of gunfire. To me, that&#39;s an echo.</p>

<p>The only reason I bring this up is because I play snare drum, and have experienced this while marching through a city. The taller buildings bounce the sound of my snare back to me, and the echo sounds the same, albeit softer...just like this</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was just in Vegas in April - and everything is on camera. There should be a ton of footage - exciting stuff like swat moving in and him bringing bags in, but also mundane shit like tipping the valet, getting coffee, sipping drinks in the casino, eating dinner etc. It&#39;s curious that we haven&#39;t been seeing this but they also aren&#39;t looking for him so maybe there is no reason to release it.
We live to fight terrorists - I think if they could, they would blame it on someone brown.  The whole story is strange. The way it was carried out, the supposed perpetrator, the lack of firm details,  the whole thing is off. I just don&#39;t think you could have multiple shooters from multiple locations without anyone getting some firm proof. All we have is grainy video - the echo of the gun and the constant flashing lights of Vegas are misleading I think. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m going to address the apparent sound of multiple guns firing simultaneously. Guns are loud, very loud. And Mandalay Bay has an interesting shape that is conducive to echoing. There were also other buildings surrounding the area that sound waves could bounce off of. It is entirely possible that the impression of multiple simultaneous bursts, was nothing more than the echoes of one gun. A way to test this would be to analyze the sound recordings for the firing pattern of the gunshots. The primary weapon that can be heard in the videos clearly had something like a bump stock and was not a true automatic rifle because its rate of fire was not consistent. Compare this to what sounds like other guns and you have your answer.</p>

<p>If you want more sources, feel free to look them up. Yes, this was a tragedy. Yes, things sound fishy regarding some of the details, but using a casino training guide to say it was planned is like showing a pic of the drive through at McD&#39;s and then someone eating a burger. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d argue that it would seem really weird for a guy to keep hauling up full bags and returning with empty. That&#39;s a ton of trips over the course of 4 days. The guns are totally believable. The thousands of rounds of ammunition? Much less so that no one would notice that or we would see a dozen+ trips up and down. Up full heavy af bag, down with empty.</p>

That&#39;s usually the first thing that happens in these situations with news coverage.. You know they have cameras in the hallways/elevators but not one video to show the guy there.</p>

<p>They should prob just tear the whole hotel down like they did with sandy hook. 27 kids was a tragedy and warranted completely removing that structure from
Existence so why don&#39;t they tear down this gigantic hotel/casino.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He was reportedly gambling 10k a day, I am sure he carried nothing him self, room service would have rolled his luggage on a cart surely, and may not have seemed suspicious for a high roller to have lots of luggage? just some speculation. Also a simple shoe box of loaded ammo is pretty heavy to be carrying around, much less the quantity he had.</p>
