What happened was real, I know multiple people that were killed and my girlfriends cousin was shot through the chest but fortunately she is stable. It happened. People were killed. Now what is weird is that on the scanners they were saying 3 shooters down and 1 in custody and now they&#39;re saying it&#39;s only 1 shooter. Some fishy shit is happening but please don&#39;t call it a hoax, lots of people I know have been effected by this. </p>

<p>Edit: I am not saying it were are being told the truth about what happened, in fact I don&#39;t believe the news or police, what I am saying is that people were actually killed and lots of people on here don&#39;t believe that </p>

<p>You need to remember that most of the public (and people here on reddit) view the media and government as their <em>parent</em>. To contradict them is to insult them. Hence the down votes. You are attacking their <em>security</em>. The fact that you are correct is secondary.</p>

<p>Probably down voted because a hoax is a deception, not a fabrication. Calling this event a hoax does not mean that there wasn&#39;t shooting and people weren&#39;t killed. Calling it a hoax means that some aspect has been lied about.</p>

<p>Thanks. The sheer magnitude of this suggests more than one shooter. We are talking 55+ dead, and 400? wounded. That&#39;s 455+ people to shoot. No mention of a machine gun. Given that, there had to be at least 2 shooters. Likely 3.</p>

<p>No its not. Plenty of bullets could have ricocheted to more people, and some were most definitively injured in the chaos, trampled and whatnot. I find it hard to believe this guy did it, or that it wasnt more shooters. Just saying, its possible</p>

<p>Anything is possible. It&#39;s not very likely. There had to have been more than one shooter. Lets say, for discussion purposes, that for every person shot that a second person got shot by a ricochet. That&#39;s still at least 125 people for the shooter to have shot. That&#39;s a lot of people to shoot. A lot of military fire fights (involving many shooters) don&#39;t kill that many people.</p>

<p>How can I intellectually be honest enough to comment on all of them, if I have none done research <em>on all of them</em>? Giving me two (or more) cases will allow me to research each and give my educated opinion on them. </p>

<p>It&#39;s quite odd how you insist on me giving uneducated analysis on topics I have not researched. Which just goes to show how <em>intellectually dishonest you are.</em></p>
