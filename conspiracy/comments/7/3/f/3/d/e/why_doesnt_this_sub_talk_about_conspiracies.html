Most people with access to the internet, will learn there is something a little off about these religions by the time they&#39;re out of highschool. I like talking about it too, but sadly there just isn&#39;t a ton to say. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a decent portion of users here who still cling to their organized religion and absolutely refuse to question it. All major organized religions in this modern day habe serious conspiracies throughout their history. The making of the Bible for one and what stories were included and not. </p>

<p>You will see them come out of the woodwork when aliens are discussed because their beleifs are so limited as to think everything past our atmosphere is a demon even though their god is supposed to be up there too, so maybe he is a demon as well.</p>

<p>You can search for religious posts, there have been many and great discussions were had. I remember seeing one somewhat recently about the Templars. Or the Jesuits or the Masons, each having their own corruption and interesting history.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It doesn&#39;t get discussed because most are either of your opinion or hold such esoteric fringe opinions and theories it&#39;s hardly sensible.</p>

<p>I roll my eyes at the thought religion is meant to control. Sure some are- scientology, Mormonism and Islam to an extent. </p>

<p>However most are well thought out philosophies of life that seek to answer existensials.</p>

<p>Many religions can make a very firm logical case for what they believe (sans the baseless 10k+ Christian sects not to be confused with legitimate Catholicism/orthodoxy)</p>

<p>In fact I can invert that and say that the idea religion is created to control others is itself the conspiracy to hide the truth of religions from humanity- keeping us nihilistic and pleasure seeking.</p>

<p>You must deny yourself infavor of some, higher, being or idea. </p>

<p>or, to be an adherent of any of the religious groups, first deny your own humanness and then spend a lifetime attempting to subdue it.</p>

<p>Impossible so naturally everyone is always in conflict and this is helpful in psychological control and oppression, guilt. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t have much to say about specific religious conspiracies at the moment (maybe later), but I thought I&#39;d throw out some ideas about religion and conspiracies in general.        </p>

<p>Yuval Harari has an interesting theory that universal religion (i.e. religions that are believed to apply to all people universally, not just to a group/locality) is the third &quot;universal imagined order&quot; after the monetary order and the imperial order. An imagined order is a cultural tool that enables more effective cooperation between people outside of their immediate family/tribe and facilitates the creation of a more specialized society. Basically, human beings have an innate tendency to prefer to associate and cooperate only with those who are members of their &quot;tribe.&quot; When two people share a common currency, live in the same empire (or state, nation, etc), or believe in the same religion, they recognize each other as being in the same tribe, even if they have many other differences. This recognition facilitates the creation of enormously complex and specialized organizations which can wield great power and influence (e.g. the Catholic church).       </p>

<p>I suspect very few religions actually begin as conspiracies (except Scientology for example). It seems logical to me that cultural tools that empower are an emergent property of human intelligence, and effective cultural tools should become more prevalent over time, with more effective cultural tools supplanting less effective ones.        </p>

<p>All imagined orders have the potential to empower the people who believe in them, but they also have the potential to empower an individual or select group of individuals, who use that power to exert control over that group and/or others. Religion possibly has the most potential for this than any other imagined order, because religion touches on the fundamental aspects of human belief and motivation, such as morality and the meaning of life. This makes them a natural target for those who would seek power for themselves.         </p>

<p>That&#39;s really all I have to say on that topic for now. But I do have one aside I thought I&#39;d throw out there. You&#39;ll notice that many of the most powerful totalitarian dictators in history have enforced a policy of atheism in their empires. This would seem to go against the idea that universal religion is the most powerful universal imagined order. However, that these rulers almost always borrow concepts and structures from universal religion and apply them to the state or to themselves, forming a kind of political religion. Food for thought.</p>

That is why our savior told us to judge others by their fruits, and not by their words. After all actions speak louder than words. If you do this; then there are very few Christians compared to the amount that says they are, but are not. We call these fake-Christians Pharisees, and I love this word because it looks like far I see, but in reality they have eyes that do not see.

<p>Think back to the time of Jesus. The Roman Empire was in full swing as the most powerful and influencial society up until then.</p>

<p>Suddenly the Gregorian calender is adopted, and resets the fucking year count. About 300 years later someone writes the Bible, and BAM Christianity 
Is born, and soon a vast amount of people fell under the control of an organized religion. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Religion is a fascinating subject chalk full of fantastical conspiracy. The Catholic Church for example is fascinating to me in its using confessionals to gather Intel on their population pre technology,  creating a proto media monopoly, the rise of notorious poisoners to the papacy, the scandal of indulgences...  Religious empires and their dogmas evolved gradually into the systems of control in place today,  and still feature prominently.  Reddit conspiracy theory tends more towards enjoying the current political soap operas, in general though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Physicists etc observe phenomena in the natural world and attempt to find patterns and the causes of them in the pursuit of knowledge and often with the hope of using this knowledge to develop technology. Why is it necessary to add &quot;in the natural world&quot;? Because those are not the only type of phenomena we observe. We also experience internal phenomena, such as thought and emotion, or dreams.
Throughout the ages there have been people oberserving internal phenomena of the mind the way physicists observe the &quot;external&quot; phenomena of the &quot;natural world&quot;. Like the phycisists of our times, they noticed patterns and identified causes of the internal phenomena we experience. These causes are what we call gods and angels etc today. Like natural science, one of the main end goals of this research was technology, or more aptly called magic in this case.
By identifying the causes of our thoughts, emotions or desires as for example Seth, it is possible to disregard those impulses, slay our internal demons and become master of the mind. This is white magic. It is also possible with the knowledge of the causes of our internal experiences to manipulate the ignorant masses. This is black magic. The knowledge of the mind is being kept secret deliberately to continue the black magic by its practicioners.</p>
