        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I was talking to my neighbor he&#39;s about 15 years younger and I asked him he understood the roots of the US hated if Iran. I understand schools not teaching this: 
The 1953 Iranian coup d&#39;état, known in Iran as the 28 Mordad coup (Persian: کودتای ۲۸ مرداد‎‎), was the overthrow of the democratically elected Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh in favour of strengthening the monarchical rule of Mohammad Reza Pahlavi on 19 August 1953, orchestrated by the United Kingdom (under the name &quot;Operation Boot&quot;) and the United States (under the name TPAJAX Project or &quot;Operation Ajax&quot;). It&#39;s a true conspiracy, but something out government wouldn&#39;t want people to know. </p>

<p>But not teaching about the hostage crisis that students like me counted the days in school seemed strange. This may not fall under typical conspiracy, but kind of curious what kind of American history is taught in school. </p>

<p>Most US public schools focus heavily on 1607-1950 when it comes to US history.  It is a deliberate way to censor and stop the youth from understanding how the national security state operates.  Worse yet, with the introduction of Common Core, children are now losing the heavy exposure to the American Revolution and Constitutional foundation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Since it was never brought up, and maybe not you personality since you&#39;re here, but what is the context for the US hatred of Iran? Or was it ever brought up? I guess terrorism, but they&#39;re link is really weak and nuclear ambition, but Pakistan is nuclear and more staple then Iran. </p>

<p>Because of counting the days in elementary school and truth hunting, I&#39;ve always known the US reasons are based in bullshit, we fucked them first. Trump reminds me Bush Jr going after Iraq over a grudge, he&#39;s a lot older and hate of Iran is ingrained, in my opinion. </p>

I think they&#39;re are divisions in the baby boomers of weather they were the free love hippy or the conservative bunch. Trump was part of the conservative bunch and many hippies went that way as well. Regardless, the baby boomer generation came after the overthrow of Iran, but nothing was released about it until long afterwards and it was belittled as conspiracy.

    <div class="md"><p>I learned about this in a college history class, teachers never mentioned it before that though.</p>

<p>In fact I really didn&#39;t learn much about recent history until college, seems like every year was focusing on the revolutionary War, civil war, and some ancient things like the church reformation and things like that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just read parts of your history and you are very well informed. The sad part is this isn&#39;t even a conspiracy, President Carter sent in a rescue mission that failed and killed people (not looking up at the moment, so don&#39;t remember how many). It was THE of all of the news of 1979. Along with long gas lines and shortages, which I&#39;m realizing you didn&#39;t learn about at all, either. </p>

Removing common knowledge or memory of events that happened while over 50% of the population is still living is truly Orwellian. Ask anyone over 45 and they&#39;ll tell you about the hostages. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>we did like some stuff around the stock market in financial literacy which was a required course, but not really. we just did the stock market game and they had us pick stocks and justify it, but they didn&#39;t teach anything really.

    <div class="md"><p>This may be the biggest conspiracy of all. It&#39;s how this country became the wealthiest on earth. I have Bloomberg or CNBC on all the time, and I&#39;ve started asking everyone I know if they know what any of it means and the answer is always no. 
Not teaching the population how to generate wealth will ensure they stay poor and obedient. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Idk the influx of dumb money would probably be good for smart investors. The thing is that most people just dont really care and claim they dont have time and shit and they wont ever understand that stuff or whatever. I told my mom years ago a couple stocks to buy and to invest her money and she still hasnt taken any action even though she knows that its good for her. Most people hate the chance of them losing money even if odds are over the long term they come out on top.</p>
