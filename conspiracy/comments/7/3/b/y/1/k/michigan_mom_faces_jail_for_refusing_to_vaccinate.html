    <div class="md"><p>Then surely you are aware there is in the USA a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine_court">special court</a> to deal with vaccine injuries, and a <a href="https://www.hrsa.gov/vaccinecompensation/">special fund</a> to compensate the victims; and also that the proceedings of this court are kept secret.</p>

<p>Furthermore:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act (NCVIA) of 1986 (42 U.S.C. §§ 300aa-1 to 300aa-34) was signed into law by President Ronald Reagan as part of a larger health bill on Nov 14, 1986, in the United States, to reduce the potential financial liability of vaccine makers due to vaccine injury claims. The legislation was aimed at ensuring a stable market supply, and to provide cost-effective arbitration for vaccine injury claims. Under the NCVIA, the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (NVICP) was created to provide a federal no-fault system for compensating vaccine-related injuries or death by establishing a claim procedure involving the United States Court of Federal Claims and special masters.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Childhood_Vaccine_Injury_Act">source</a></p>

<p>So this court was established to defend <em>pharmaceutical companies</em>, not patients/victims.</p>

<p>Or perhaps you&#39;re a pharmaceutical company yourself, and that&#39;s the reason you display such obscurantist advocacy for the initiation of violence against people who choose to act in conscience?</p>

<p>My bad if that&#39;s the case. Cheers Mr Sanofi-Pasteur.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That all seems very reasonable to me. There was a shortage of vaccines. The ignorant public kept suing vaccine manufactures. The government was afraid the manufactures would stop making the crucial medicine. So they made a &quot;no fault&quot; court. </p>

<p>Vaccines can have side effects. And in those cases the patient deserves a payout. The no fault court provides this.</p>

<p>People are ignorant and went sue crazy on pharmaceutical companies. The no fault court kept the medicine supply going.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fuck.</p>

<p>For all of you in bad marriages with children, remember that both marriage and divorce are acts of the state, and as soon as the question of custody is put forward in a divorce proceeding, the children are legally wards of the state and no longer legally &quot;belong&quot; to either parent. The court &quot;grants custody&quot; to the parents as it sees fit.</p>

<p>So, in a dispute between separated or divorced parents over the details of raising a child comes into question, the parents give up their right to decide – and the courts will always side with &quot;the norm&quot; when there are no specific laws. &quot;The norm&quot; can also include putting the child in foster care if the judge decides that neither parent is &quot;in the right&quot; and/or the judge is getting kickbacks for doing so.</p>

<p>If you are reasonable, loving, non-abusive parents who no longer want to be together, use mediation, personal written agreements, etc. and WORK YOUR SHIT OUT WITHOUT THE STATE.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is an incredibly insightful comment, thanks.</p>

<p>Marriage should be deinstitutionalized. People are perfectly free to establish private contracts, much like a shareholders&#39; agreement. Churches / religions / cults are similarly perfectly free to have sacraments/rituals/celebrations that fit their criteria.</p>

<p>That would please the gays, as they could &quot;marry&quot;, and would not be &quot;discriminated&quot;. That would please the Christians, as marriage would thus be re-sacralized. It would please Muslisms and Mormons, as they could have polygamy. It would please feminists, as they could have polyandry.</p>

<p>Indeed liberty tends to make everyone happy. That&#39;s why you rarely hear it mentionned.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jesus Christ...I doubt  guys been in relationship, yet alone married.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>People are perfectly free to establish private contracts, much like a shareholders&#39; agreement. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>And of you breach that agreement and not withhold it you would be sent to court. Just like in marriage or after divorce if you try to take custody of the kids or house, etc.   Also law clearly states what is a &quot;shareholders agreement&quot; or rather who can enter a shareholders agreement, juts like how marriage is defined (hence the debate and gays fighting for these definitions) </p>

<p>In other words: marriage is already a &quot;shareholders agreement&quot; between two parties, albeit it doesn&#39;t go into details (just like shareholders agreement doesn&#39;t have to)  but if you really want to make your marriage a contract with every detail laid out - you can  have  a prenup. Good luck t your partner  when you lay down every detail for her to sign....and you are supposedly already madly in love .</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That would please the Christians, as marriage would thus be re-sacralized. It would please Muslims and Mormons, as they could have polygamy. It would please feminists, as they could have polyandry.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And  each of these would have their own institutions that uphold the rule of marriage. You want to get married as Christian/Muslim/Mormon local pastor/imam/priest has to approve it/sign it.</p>

<p>Not to mention that that you have to authorise an institution to allow them to issue  marriage certificates.  Just like issuing licence can be be done by approved authority. Otherwise how would you prove  that Person X is your wife?  Just like how we know who are the people that authorised to drive. So, dho decides on that? </p>

<p>&quot;Oh yes, officer, this women here beside me, tied up,  is my wife she is not abducted&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Prove it!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh no worries, here is the paper from MyOwnChurch<sup>tm.&quot;</sup></p>

<p>&quot;Oh no worries, you are free to go mr Libertatrian Man.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are probably a lawyer, which would explain your lack of understanding. It seems you have been formatted to think in a certain way; you cannot imagine what it would be like to take the State out of the equation. Indeed the idea of liberty is foreign to you.</p>

<p>(This was an answer to your condescending 1st sentence. In my case I intended no offense).</p>

<p>The big difference is that &quot;civil status&quot; would thus not be codified; it would be a personal, private matter. The State would not be involved in regulating relationships between consenting adults (at least not <em>a priori</em>, it would get involved only if parties decide to rely on its civil courts for enforcement, and even then the contract could stipulate private arbitration).</p>

<p>I have negotiated and signed many shareholders agreements in my life, and it isn&#39;t that complicated in small companies. (Or perhaps it is in the US, people there love litigation, but it isn&#39;t the norm). You typically have two dozen clauses, usually quite standard: drag along, tag along, first refusal, voting quorum, arrangements on how/when general assemblies are arranged/convocated, etc.</p>

<p>Furthermore churches or whoever helps &quot;celebrate&quot; weddings could propose templates. The consenting adults indeed would stipulate in the contract how future disputes would be settled, they could be the State, or private/religious arbitration, etc. It would be voluntary and thus preferable.</p>

<p>In practice many people would forgo a contract altogether, and marriage would only be vow before God, a sacramemt. Legally each human would remain his own man/woman, which is  great too.</p>

<p>Marriage was institutionalized to protect the women, when they didn&#39;t earn a living; this requirement is obsolete.</p>

<p>Regarding your last quip, I won&#39;t get into it, as it assumes the misanthropic position that humans are savages without the benevolent regulation of the State. Also it ignores criminal law exists independently of marriage.</p>
