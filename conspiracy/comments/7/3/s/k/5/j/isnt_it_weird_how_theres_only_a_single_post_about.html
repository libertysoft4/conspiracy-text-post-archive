<p>Edit: I guess maybe it&#39;s not thaaaaat weird since it only happened 7ish hour agos and the top posts on r/all/top are all 14+ hours old(makes sense obviously since older posts have more potential for more total points). Still I would expect there to be more very upvoted posts on the subject and I would expect for at least one or two to be higher.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There certainly are suspicious things about the event, but there were apparently 20,000 people at this concert.  With that much going on all at once there is going to be alot of confusion.  Also from the reports it seemed he shot himself as police breached his room.  They likely also shot him during the entry because that&#39;s what they are trained to do especially if they hear gunshots because they don&#39;t know if he is shooting at them.  Regardless of where they came from though he ended up with bullets in him.</p>

<p>Admittedly nothing is known yet, but he&#39;s obviously a white male, who lived nearly his entire life is heavily Democrat jurisdictions (California mostly) and decided to commit genocide at a country music festival. </p>

<p>Bayesian reasoning is your friend! If there is a terrorist attack carried out by a white male then it is faaaar more likely to be the result of radical far-right terrorism.</p>

<p>Even if the shooter happened to come from a part of the country that leans slightly democrat that would only shift the needle a little towards the left and the shooter would still more than likely be a part of the far-right.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why do you guys always link to such shitty sources when you say that? </p>

<p>[Heres the global terrorism database sorted to the US only. If you take a look at the first 100 attacks, exactly 3 are white extremist attacks.

<p>Why do you people always use editorialized bullshit opinion articles and try to pass it off as truth? </p>

<p>&quot;it is my opinion that white supremacists and right wing extremists commit more attacks then left wing or wahabiists&quot;</p>

<p>Thats what that headline should say. But the primary source, the global terrorism database, proves you completely fucking wrong.</p>

<p>That requires evidence that it&#39;s being deduced from.  What evidence is available that would lead to left-wing?</p>

<p>Otherwise it&#39;s called baseless speculation, if not outright propaganda.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The evidence is that it was a planned attack on a country music concert. Country music events like this are made up of mostly white, conservative-leaning fans. So one logical conclusion is that the attacker might have been a radical left-winger out to kill white conservatives. There are certainly other possibilities, as well, but that is why asking for a &quot;source&quot; makes no sense in this context. </p>

<p>Hey there, I downvoted you but want to give you a reason why so you don&#39;t think I am a shill. You can call something &quot;deductive reasoning&quot; when you provide 0 evidence or arguments behind your reasoning. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I love how you are cheering on violence like this. It proves how sick you authoritarians are. Youre so jealous of freedom that you enjoy watching Americans die. Jesus Christ you are fucking so fucking jealous that you want people to actually fucking die just so they dont have something you cant. </p>

<p><strong>Here is an interesting statistic: for every person killed in Chicago this year someone has had acid thrown in their face in London!</strong></p>

<p>This shooting may not have been able to be stopped by a concealed carrier but the reality is that outside venues are going to have to provide cover from this kind of thing.</p>

<p>And you are fucking acting like criminals cannot get guns in Europe just because the law says?! Retarded! You are fucking retarded! Ever wonder why theaters and schools are such popular targets for mass shooters!!?! Because theyre so-called gun free zones! All gun control does is take weapons away from law abiding citizens would actually act as a deterrent towards active shooters. The only thing was that in Las Vegas the ranges was so long, but people are just going to have to figure out how to provide cover from that. </p>

<p>Have you <em>any</em> fucking street smarts?! You fucking know that there are guns for sale on the black market in Europe?! Are you so fucking naive you think that someone cant get a fucking gun if they want?! Whats your solution? More power to the state!!?!?!</p>

<p>What the fuck is your problem? What the fuck is wrong with you? Do you have annnnnny sense of logic? Do you have any respect for personal freedom? Or do you think everywhere should be like Sweden where the teach women to let guys rape them and prevent them from even having pepper spray?! Isnt that just fucking lovely? </p>

<p>Do you want everywhere to be like sweden where if you defend yourself from an attacker you are fucking liable for the damages inflicted on your fucking attacker!? Wouldnt that be fucking great if the whole fucking world was like that?! Would that make you fucking happy?! Would  that give you a control boner because youre such a fucking authoritarian?! You like seeing women raped and young people shot to death without any option to fight back?! You like it when the state punishes <em>victims</em>?</p>

<p>And what the fuck happens when criminals become smart enough to use 3D printers to create guns?! What happens then smart pants?! You think they are just going to follow the laws even though a fucking glue gun and some legos is able to print out a fully functional and concealable firearm?!
<a href="https://3dprint.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/3D-printed-gun-Liberator-006.jpg">https://3dprint.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/3D-printed-gun-Liberator-006.jpg</a>

<p>Its only a fucking matter of time! But right now the average euro criminal is too fucking stupid but someday soon one of them is going to learn how and then teach his buddies and then you will never get the genie back in the bottle. And the worst part is the state will just use it as more of a reason to take you fucking rights away. Theyre going to go through youre whole fucking life and any of your text messages or conversations that are inappropriate are going to get you in trouble. </p>

<p><strong>You know what personal firearm rights guard against besides just attackers? Totalitarian police states, coming soon to theater near you!</strong> And no Im not happy about Europe getting cucked like you are happy that Americans die. I am literally just telling you the eventuality which there is no hope against. Maybe if you all werent so ungodly cucked you would try to do something about it but even then once a government gets your guns there is not much you can fucking do and getting your rights back is harder than pulling teeth.</p>

<p>But anyway you dont even want freedom. You have stockholm syndrome. You think your slave master loves you. You think your oppressor has your best interest in mind. Youre brainwashed by the state. Your ego makes you believe that freedom is for uneducated freaks. Your ego tricks you into thinking that the elites are going to have a place for you in there system. Fucking wake up!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you people realise that not everything is a massive conspiracy? If you had actually payed attention you would have found loads of posts all over Reddit about it. Do you think Spez changed the algorithm in order to keep them off r/all? I thought the whole deal with Spez was that he&#39;s apparently an extreme left communist ala Kim Jong Un, if so he wouldn&#39;t be pro gun would he? He would want to put the posts up so he can make more people go anti gun. People need to think before calling something a conspiracy, you guys all contradict yourselves. Now I&#39;m sure this will be downvoted to oblivion, removed and I&#39;ll be banned but I do think you guys need to pay more attention to what you actually think, instead of flip flopping between different theories as they come to light.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Peoppe come on.</p>

<p>Reddot has been drastically censoring anything with any major evidence.. especially of a crike of harsh visualls of info that might dox someone ... For many years now.</p>

<p>No one shoukd be using reddit as their primary source for any user submitted info naymore.</p>

<p>You have to go to less censored places like 4chan or voat for that now.</p>

<p>Reddit is only for the debates they will allow you to have.  Othing that might be about (censored) or (censored) or (censored)</p>

<p>Seriously stop being surprised.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why do you guys always link to such shitty sources when you say that? </p>

<p>[Heres the global terrorism database sorted to the US only. If you take a look at the first 100 attacks, exactly 3 are white extremist attacks. Why dont you do me a favor and count how many anti-white attacks there were? how about how many Jihadi or islamic terror attacks?](<a href="https://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/search/Results.aspx?expanded=no&amp;amp;casualties_type=b&amp;amp;casualties_max=&amp;amp;dtp2=all&amp;amp;success=yes&amp;amp;country=217&amp;amp;ob=GTDID&amp;amp;od=desc&amp;amp;page=1&amp;amp;count=100#results-table">https://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/search/Results.aspx?expanded=no&amp;amp;casualties_type=b&amp;amp;casualties_max=&amp;amp;dtp2=all&amp;amp;success=yes&amp;amp;country=217&amp;amp;ob=GTDID&amp;amp;od=desc&amp;amp;page=1&amp;amp;count=100#results-table</a></p>

<p>Why do you people always use editorialized bullshit opinion articles and try to pass it off as truth? </p>

<p>&quot;it is my opinion that white supremacists and right wing extremists commit more attacks then left wing or wahabiists&quot;</p>

<p>Thats what that headline should say. But the primary source, the global terrorism database, proves you completely fucking wrong.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well you already showed you don&#39;t care about sources but this is a study published during the Trump Admin, you can read the whole thing but seeing as you are already dismissive of facts I doubt you willhttp://<a href="http://www.gao.gov/assets/690/683984.pdf:">www.gao.gov/assets/690/683984.pdf:</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>from Sept. 12, 2001, to Dec. 31, 2016  — there have been 85 attacks in the country by violent extremists resulting in 225 deaths. GAO reported citing data from the U.S. Extremist Crime Database.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of those 225 deaths:</p>

<p>• 106 individuals were killed by far-right violent extremists in 62 separate incidents;</p>

<p>• 119 individuals were killed by radical Islamist violent extremists in 23 separate incidents;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Mateen isn&#39;t even officially considered an ISIS attack even though he directly pledged allegiance to ISIS before the attack! Anyone who has half a brain can see through the lies, though.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Okay, so what numbers do you posit? Where do you get your information and data? Or do you jsut feel like you are right?</p>
