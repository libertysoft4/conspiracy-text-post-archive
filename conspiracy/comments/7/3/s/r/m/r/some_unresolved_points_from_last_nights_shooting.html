        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Not claiming a full conclusion just listing out points we should keep in mind going forward. Maybe some answers to come. </p>

<p>Before starting if you believe a mass shooting has never been faked on U.S. Soil this isn&#39;t for you.</p>

<p>1- (IMO a large red flag) A woman was seen/heard telling people to leave the concert. Now I have no idea why she wasn&#39;t taken seriously. She was allegedly removed from the show, and later another couple was also removed. Witness have Quoted her &quot;They&#39;re all around, You&#39;re all going to die!&quot;. Some have said the woman was Hispanic, and I have seen some reports saying she was Asian. Identifying her as the wife of the shooter.  </p>

<p>2 - Hotel Windows. God this one will for sure be debated. So he was on the 20th floor. (an early report said 37th). No method of how he removed the hotel window has been prevented with evidence. For all we know could have been on a balcony. Photographic evidence of the scene IMO is going to come out to late. Meaning not creditable. Sorry, but this post 9/11/sandy hook no chances taken here. </p>

<p>3 - More than one. First off the woman quoted is referring to more than one shooter. Along with the fact that many have speculated how that Gunfire could have reached the concert area. It is a fairly good distance between the two. I live in Texas, and yes have my own experince with firearms. One thing you do learn is bullet&#39;s dont keep straight  forever. In fact one of the largest gun ranges here in Texas has measured off that distance for a park sitting directly behind the range. In order to figure this one out full reports on the bullets trajectory are needed.</p>

<p>4 - Mobile videos, and the sound. I have heard live gunfire enough to know that sound. Someone is clearly shooting into the crowd, but they don&#39;t sound nearly that far away. It sounds like ground level fire. Now reports have come out that cops shot at the shooter in the hotel. I really hope that isn&#39;t true. Because if so it&#39;s fucking insanity. NO ONE IS THAT GOOD A SHOT. No one can blind fire a pistol at a man in a hotel across the street, and not accidentally injure another person. Any officer should know better. </p>

<p>5 - the lead up. Little fucked, but I would put my money on this horse. Normally in American history when this happens a military/safety drill will occur near by the location. While I haven&#39;t identified that trend. It is very easy to see a number of people predicting this shooting. IN FACT a video yesterday afternoon was posted to this forum discussing what we need to do to be ready for another &quot;sandy hook&quot;. Which is fairly on the nose. </p>

<p>Partial conclusion if this has larger conspiracy qualities (which I believe it does) I think this is a combo of the airport shooting, and other false flags. A larger plot influenced this man to do something unthinkable while real marksman picked off crowd goers.  </p>

<p>The reason I contemplate this is because none of the performers were killed. Which is weird to me anyone with real chaotic tendencies would see the value of  killing someone famous. The value being more chaos of course. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t doubt people died at this concert. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t doubt that a man was driven to do something awful. </p>

<p>I do doubt that he was able to successfully murder that large a group without help. </p>

<p>I also believe that the concert was abruptly ended after a woman yelling you&#39;re all gonna die because other forces were at work. </p>

<p>I have been to an uncountable amount of concerts. I have seen whole stadiums go quiet in the desire of not hurting someone. (see the MCR concert in Houston video. I was there.) It makes no sense that authorities did not get involved at that point. </p>

<p>Also did she call the police? </p>

<p>A lot of unanswered questions, and by the time the public has its information it will be to late. The info easily discreditable, and most likely doctored. </p>
