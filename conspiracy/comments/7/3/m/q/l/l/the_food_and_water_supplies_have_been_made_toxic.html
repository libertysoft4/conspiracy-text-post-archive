<li><p>Our sink water is totally contaminated with stuff like Flouride to dumb us down and make us sick. </p></li>
<li><p>The food being fed to cows is full of every poison imaginable. The cows eat that food and then we eat the cows. </p></li>
<li><p>Everything in convenient stores are full of unhealthy, fattening garbage plus poisons such as aspatame (found in many drinks). </p></li>
<li><p>Also we are injesting chemtrails forcefully. </p></li>

<p>The idea behind toxicity in our foods is to make us overweight, physically unhealthy, mentally unhealthy, and for us to die an early death. </p>

<p>Shit sucks, for sure. We can grow our own food, eat wild edibles, collect rainwater, barter skills and supplies etc.</p>

<p>Sadly, it seems the majority of distracted humans prefer the system to do their thinking for them and are unable to care enough about important things like contaminated food/water.</p>

<p>Too busy watching the latest vacuous shit on the idiot box and yelling at the screen. Whilst chugging a toxic blend of take away grease and mass produced beer.</p>

<p>In some states you cannot. Florida has legislation about this iirc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>On top of that, standard agricultural practices cover the produce with toxic chemicals and grow everything in heavily minerally depleted soils so the food itself is much less nutritious than it would be if it was grown properly. I remember seeing some study claiming a modern grocery store apple has something like 70% less magnesium and a bunch of other minerals than grocery store apples tested from 50-60 years ago if you need to eat 4-5  apples to get the same nutrient quantity as one apple in the past it&#39;s no wonder people are getting sick on top of everything you said. Don&#39;t even get me started on what we&#39;re doing to the gut microbiome and how fucked up our dairy industry has become.</p>
