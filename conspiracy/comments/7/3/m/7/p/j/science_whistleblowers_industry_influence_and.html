<li><p>Richard Horton, editor in chief of The Lancet, recently wrote: <a href="http://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/lancet/PIIS0140-6736%2815%2960696-1.pdf">“Much of the scientific literature, perhaps half, may simply be untrue. Afflicted by studies with small sample sizes, tiny effects, invalid exploratory analyses, and flagrant conflicts of interest, together with an obsession for pursuing fashionable trends of dubious importance, science has taken a turn towards darkness. As one participant put it, “poor methods get results”.</a></p></li>
<li><p>In 2009, Dr. Marcia Angell of the New England Journal of Medicine wrote: <a href="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2009/jan/15/drug-companies-doctorsa-story-of-corruption/">“It is simply no longer possible to believe much of the clinical research that is published, or to rely on the judgment of trusted physicians or authoritative medical guidelines. I take no pleasure in this conclusion, which I reached slowly and reluctantly over my two decades as an editor of The New England Journal of Medicine.”</a></p></li>
<li><p>&quot;I can&#39;t tell you exactly what percentage of the trials are flawed, but I think the problem is far bigger than you imagine, and getting worse...it is so easy to manipulate data, conceal it or fabricate it...there is almost a code of silence not to speak about it.&quot; -<a href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/zeitgeist/spiegel-interview-with-whistleblower-doctor-peter-wilmshurst-a-1052159.html">Whistleblower Dr. Peter Wilmshurst</a></p></li>
<li><p>&quot;Reproducibility in science is not very sexy. Because our scientific culture generally rewards innovation over cautiousness, replicating a study conducted by others will not get a researcher a publication in a high-end journal, a splashy headline in a newspaper, or a large funding grant from the government. Only an estimated <a href="http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2015/reproduce-or-bust-bringing-reproducibility-back-to-center-stage/">0.15% of all published results are direct replications of previous studies.</a>&quot;</p></li>

<li><p>&quot;The neuroscientific community needs to challenge the current scientific model driven by dysfunctional research practices tacitly encouraged by the <a href="http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2015-09/aof-rnw092515.php">&#39;publish or perish&#39; doctrine, which is precisely leading to the low reliability and the high discrepancy of results.&quot;</a></p></li>

<li><p>Back in the 1960s, a sugar industry executive wrote fat checks to a group of Harvard researchers so that they’d downplay the links between sugar and heart disease in a prominent medical journal—and the researchers did it, according to historical documents reported in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine. One of those Harvard researchers went on to become the head of nutrition at the United States Department of Agriculture, where he set the stage for the federal government’s current dietary guidelines. <a href="http://arstechnica.com/science/2016/09/sugar-industry-bought-off-scientists-skewed-dietary-guidelines-for-decades/">All in all, the corrupted researchers and skewed scientific literature successfully helped draw attention away from the health risks of sweets and shift the blame solely to fats—for nearly five decades. The low-fat, high-sugar diets that health experts subsequently encouraged are now seen as a main driver of the current obesity epidemic.</a> </p></li>

<li><p>A vaginal mesh implant made by Johnson &amp; Johnson (J&amp;J) was launched without a clinical trial, and then marketed for five years after the company learned that it had a higher failure rate than their two earlier devices. Internal company emails disclosed in a US court case, in which a 51-year-old woman was awarded a record $57m in damages this month, also show that senior executives even briefly considered suppressing unfavourable data that “could compromise the future” of the device. But documents submitted to the court show J&amp;J staff had raised concerns about the “spinning of data” in emails and male executives are seen bantering about a suggestion that sex with an earlier patient with mesh complications must be “like screwing a wire brush”. In other emails, J&amp;J staff complain of colleagues “constantly spinning data” and of a dangerous blurring of the “lines between commercial and research” divisions. “I am continually amazed and surprised at our need to push back,” wrote Judi Gauld, Ethicon’s former clinical director in Scotland. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/sep/29/revealed-johnson-johnsons-irresponsible-actions-over-vaginal-mesh-implant">https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/sep/29/revealed-johnson-johnsons-irresponsible-actions-over-vaginal-mesh-implant</a></p></li>

Experts and academic institutions are great resources of information and knowledge, but always read their reports and methodologies directly and evaluate for yourself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve worked in some research chemistry for commercial applications. There is a lot of pressure to find what they want to find. This wasn&#39;t in medicine, just saying it is definitely a thing. Oh, and one time I made a mistake that gave us erroneous data that was beneficial to the project and holy hell, the whole rest of the directions of the project were scrapped instantly. They had me working day and night investigating this new property. </p>

<p>I eventually realized my error, and it was extremely hard to come clean about it in the face of their enthusiasm. And then I never could convince them it was really a mistake, they came back to it repeatedly wanting me to make it real for them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Merck is currently being sued by whistle blowers for lying about the efficacy of the mumps portion of the MMR. </p>

<p>“As the single largest purchaser of childhood vaccines (accounting for more than 50 percent of all vaccine purchasers), the United States is by far the largest financial victim of Merck’s fraud. But the ultimate victims here are the millions of children who every year are being injected with a mumps vaccine that is not providing them with an adequate level of protection against mumps. And while this is a disease the CDC targeted ts the single largest purchaser of childhood vaccines (accounting for more than 50 percent of all vaccine purchasers), the United States is byo eradicate by now, the failure in Merck’s vaccine has allowed this disease to linger with significant outbreaks continuing to occur,” the suit alleges.
