        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hey everyone. As I&#39;m sure you all have experienced the same, I&#39;ve had trouble opening up others&#39; eyes to what I <em>know</em> is true regarding the conspiratorial state of reality. Personally, I come from a family of intellectuals, whatever that means. Everyone has gone to a top-tier US college (don&#39;t get me wrong, I bullshitted my way into and out of school) and everyone holds an IQ above 135. Not bad. So, you&#39;d think my family would have an open mind, collectively speaking, right? Well, no. The conditioning of humanity goes so insanely deep and the process of de-conditioning the mind is going to have to be profound, when we consider how mass change is going to have to happen over time. Anyway, I wanted to share the break down of facts that I shared with one of my narrow-minded relatives, which ended up with him saying, &quot;Oh shit.&quot; </p>

<p>First, I shared this video of Steven Crowder and his employees who went under cover as a means of slipping into the Antifa agency, pretending to be on their side. Crowder does great work here, I think, and exposes Antifa for being the narcissistic, hypocritical, illogical, hateful, dangerous group that they are. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RmNz2jGzsDA&amp;amp;t=94s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RmNz2jGzsDA&amp;amp;t=94s</a></p>

<p>This opened my relative&#39;s eyes to the fact that Antifa <em>is</em> a fundamentally illogical group, in that they claim to fight against fascism, yet the way in which they go about demanding change is inherently fascist. They&#39;re using force and ignorance (ignorant in that they <em>will not</em> listen to another&#39;s opinion because they are so devoutly certain their is correct; this is dangerous because their opinions <em>are not</em> correct). So, using that video, I was able to get my relative to agree that the Antifa movement is disgusting.</p>

<p>Then, I told him that Antifa is funded by a man named George Soros, who has been proven to have spent millions and millions of dollars to fund social engineering campaigns. In the video below, which I shared with my relative, we can see Antifa members complaining to their master, Soros, because he&#39;d yet to pay them for protesting. They literally chant &quot;George Soros, where&#39;s our money?&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBmuDDm_CuM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBmuDDm_CuM</a></p>

<p>So, by now, my relative has agreed that there are billionaires who are aware of human psychology and how <em>what we think</em> affects <em>how we see the world</em>, which affects how we participate in the world. So long as people like Soros pay robots to revolt against logic and equality, he is more inclined to remain in power. So long as a billionaire creates more noise within the collective thought structure, the harder it is for good-hearted humanity to slow down, find our balance, and think logically and with unconditional love/Oneness. </p>

<p>From here, I shared the now-popular documentary <em>Everything is a Rich Man&#39;s Trick: From JFK to 9/11</em>. Having developed the foundation of conspiracy within my relative, by opening his eyes to the fact that billionaires view reality as a game which they can manipulate for their own gain by creating false narratives which affect the collective conscious/thought structure, I then wanted to show him that the illusion of reality goes even deeper. I showed him that the history we&#39;ve been told is a lie; the history <em>we</em> heard in the US was the history written by the victor. I asked him pseudo-philosophical questions like, &quot;Why is it that the majority of humanity believes we come <em>into</em> the world when, in truth, we come <em>out of</em> the world?&quot; By this point, my relative was scratching his head and beginning to question what life actually is. (Everything is a Rich Man&#39;s trick can be seen below)</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1Qt6a-vaNM&amp;amp;t=3277s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1Qt6a-vaNM&amp;amp;t=3277s</a></p>

<p>Then, I went on to show him the video of JFK giving a speech, very close to the time he was assassinated, about how a cancerous cabal of psycho-monsters is hiding within the shadows of power and money and is working to fight back against &#39;the light&#39;. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdMbmdFOvTs">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdMbmdFOvTs</a></p>

<p>After that, I showed him the video of the ex-CIA agent who, on his death bed, admits that he was a part of the group that assassinated JFK. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFAZ8DmcQLg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFAZ8DmcQLg</a></p>

<p>By this point, my relative was so blown away by what he&#39;d seen that he wasn&#39;t sure how to interpret it all. So, he chose to take it all personally. He chose to feel like I was attacking him for his lack of fact-based truth. If you really think about it, everything you think <em>you</em> are is a product of the world you think you know. Because everything is literally One (r/holofractal), what you think you are is also related to what you think the world is. So, it didn&#39;t bother me that my relative was upset <em>at me</em> for telling him the truth because I understand that I was basically ripping him from his illusory attachment to reality. But this is where my theory gets sort of deep regarding end-game conspiracy.</p>

<p>Right now, the world is lost. We are lost because we&#39;ve been groomed into believing that what we are is our thoughts. Mainstream society is dancing to the rhythm of the fiddler, and the fiddler is playing a song of illusion. Because we literally believe we are our identity (which is just a thought, or a memory, and which developed <em>within</em> what we <em>actually</em> are, which is consciousness), billionaires are able to control us by writing false narratives within society, using their endless piles of money, to which we attach ourselves emotionally. We attach ourselves emotionally to the news and to the mainstream narrative because we&#39;ve yet to, generally speaking, understand what we literally are.</p>

<p>We are not our thoughts, we are not our identity, we are not our memories or experiences. We are the life force in which all thoughts take place. Haven&#39;t you ever noticed that you do not choose your thoughts? They just happen. All of reality is just happening, but we&#39;ve been tricked into believing everything is happening &#39;to me&#39;. The &#39;me&#39; is an illusion, and when that&#39;s understood, you let go of your attachment to the noise of life. And when that illusory attachment fades away, no longer are you capable of being controlled by the false narratives because no longer are you attaching yourself and all of your emotion to what you learn. So, true freedom is going to come for all of us when we take a moment to look <em>within</em>, rather than perpetually looking outward to fill the void we create within ourselves. We <em>are</em> the void. </p>

<p>&quot;It is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it.&quot; - Aristotle</p>

<p>Edit: If you are interested in the topic of awakening (where consciousness becomes conscious that it is conscious, rather than allowing your illusory belief that <em>you</em> are your thoughts to continue controlling and creating your false reality) so that you can begin or continue the process of letting go of attachment, here is a video that might open your eyes to what we all really are.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>U/simple_beauty if you really want to know why this antifa movement is also going on, look into OPERATION GLADIO. The run down on it back in the cold war was to divide the left and right. Then CIA and cointerpol had agents stage attacks to make the left seem way more violent to create sympathy for the right. It&#39;s to prevent a communistic/Soviet uprise and to prevent and antiwar movement.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow. Incredible. I think what&#39;s happened is that humanity is suffering so intensely right now, across the world and every day, that people are beginning to let go of their attachment to life. Through that process, one&#39;s mind opens because you no longer hold a narrative that you believe to be true. You, instead, pursue fact and logic. You let go of the past and live now. I&#39;m not at all surprised that the agenda for the creation of the antifa group goes all the way back to the cold war. These people who consider themselves our owners are people who understand how humanity thinks. Imagine how well they understand our psychology now that they&#39;ve tracked us with tech for the past few decades. And they know that the more separation they create within us, which they often do with fear and terror, the harder it will be for humanity to wake up and begin working on a reality where we all think as one and on behalf of one another. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well not only that though. Think of all the protests around the U.S. and other countries. All that is doing is training police and military in how to deal with civil unrest. Everyone they call the national guard in, it just so happened to be their weekend duty and they have been training and going to classes for these events.
But to be honest war is a reset button to hate and if you watch certain company&#39;s stock that also happens to to have large military contracts. They all have been relatively going up. But I really do feel and with deployments to Europe happening, we have a huge Chan e of going to war.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah. I agree that there&#39;s still a major chance of going to war. But when you consider how deeply we&#39;ve been conditioned into seeing an illusory reality so that they can utilize us to do their worldly bidding, it makes it easier to believe there is positive-ET influence happening right now. I even think these 3 hurricanes that were originally expected to destroy the East coast of the US have been tampered with by other worldly forces. If you think I&#39;m insane, maybe check out Alex Collier on YouTube, by the way. He predicted 9/11 and claims to be in contact with other worldy forces from the Andromedan galaxy. He says these beings are far ahead of our time, literally, and that their reality started becoming very negative and they had to trace, back in time, where the negativity was coming from and it lead them to our world. He says they are here now to save both us and them, but he says that ultimately we are going to have to save ourselves. That&#39;s why I put an emphasis on consciousness awakening. We have to let go of our past and our attachment to what is so that we can fundamentally unite. We have to let go of <em>all</em> the conditioning, ultimately, I think. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks. I think the &#39;talent&#39; in seeing the necessary ways to help someone awaken comes through having suffered out of a delusional psychology, yourself. My entire life has been an unfolding of delusions until I found myself at peace. I had to let go of attachment to the ego, which was tough but a necessity. I&#39;ll certainly try to help more people, but only if I see an opening and a willingness in the person to listen to an opposing perspective. </p>

<p>Great post OP. Over the last two years I’ve gradually arrived at the same place, albeit through different sources.</p>

<p>In terms of human experience and the truths I&#39;ve had to discover about what we literally <em>are</em> (conscious awareness), I started the journey of the inner rabbit hole by listening to lectures by Alan Watts haha. Pairing his words with LSD certainly &quot;shocked the system&quot; into a new mode of perception, lol. </p>

<p>I have heard of HLI. It&#39;s funny you share that post, actually, because I posted a few comments under a throwaway account, to which I was told my perspective is &quot;Troward, through and through.&quot; Troward is a known for influencing the New Thought Movement and the mystic Christianity background. Unrelated, but Troward is worth researching if you don&#39;t know his work!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ha!! Are you kidding! The synchronicity is real!</p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen your comments around plenty of subreddits I frequent. Your words are wise and have taught me a lot. I&#39;m going to spend time today thinking about the sources I consider most valuable to <em>my</em> current perspective. Would you be willing to share some of yours most cherished works? I can say, I will likely point you in the way of people like Alan Watts, as I&#39;ve read all his books and listened to hundreds of his lectures. I might also point you in the way of modern, Western, enlightened teachers who give profound talks on the nature of being.</p>

<p>So funny to come full circle with you. Let me get to thinking. </p>

<p>In addition to and following on from my research into HLI, these are the books that have most profoundly shaped my perception and led to my current positions on the nature of reality - both as the  tangible platform our consciousness inhabits and as a learned construct we mutually participate in:</p>

<p>I agree that this is no coincidence. We seem to pull into our lives the things we need, when we need them, in order to absorb more information and expand our conscious horizon. It&#39;s crazy to me that I&#39;ve ever been depressed because there is so much obvious and simple beauty/significance happening in each moment of every day <em>just because</em> we are. Just because life happens. Just because this game exists where life is conscious of itself participating in itself, with itself. When I go outside to see the ocean, that is me. When I fly a kite, that is me. When I play a song on the piano, that is me. I mean, to know that...how can I ever get bored? How can I ever feel alone? How can I ever be depressed? Sorry...random tangent. Feeling good today. Cheers, friend!</p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t be surprised, because they&#39;d be to be unfathomably obtuse to expose themselves like that. Can you point me to where you heard it was a sarcastic chant? </p>

<p>What&#39;s <em>frightening</em>, to me, is that the majority of these antiFa protesters really do think they&#39;re acting on behalf of fairness and equality and truth. The brainwashing and ill-logic is so profound today. I <em>wish</em> they were all acting against their own morals and logic. I really do. I wish they were being paid and were simply acting. But, as you say, the majority have <em>no idea</em> what they&#39;ve been conned into. And that&#39;s what has driven me to observe the ego, the mind&#39;s identity, and how vulnerable our species seems to be to brainwashing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do have to say, though, that I&#39;m also still considering whether or not it really was sarcasm. I mean, if they hadn&#39;t been paid, imagine how quickly they&#39;d be paid (or killed) if Soros actually saw that these idiots were protesting back against the hand that feeds them? If these humans are stupid enough to protest what it is they&#39;re protesting, they might be stupid enough to protest, in public, against Soros, exposing him in the process. Who knows. But, yeah, if you have proof of it being a chant, I&#39;d love to see it. Thanks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ha!! Are you kidding! The synchronicity is real!</p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen your comments around plenty of subreddits I frequent. Your words are wise and have taught me a lot. I&#39;m going to spend time today thinking about the sources I consider most valuable to <em>my</em> current perspective. Would you be willing to share some of yours most cherished works? I can say, I will likely point you in the way of people like Alan Watts, as I&#39;ve read all his books and listened to hundreds of his lectures. I might also point you in the way of modern, Western, enlightened teachers who give profound talks on the nature of being.</p>

<p>So funny to come full circle with you. Let me get to thinking. </p>
