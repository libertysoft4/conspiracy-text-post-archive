        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>There is an incredible amount of misinformation and propaganda flying around this sub about Puerto Rico. For those interested in conspiracy, Puerto Rico&#39;s past and present are a treasure trove. Are you fascinated by puppet governments, and exploitation by Wall Street bankers, pharmaceutical companies, and US corporations? Police repression and coverups, and assassinations by the CIA? Then you should definitely do some digging into Puerto Rico.</p>

<p>There is a concentrated effort afoot to obscure Puerto Rico&#39;s debt as the fault of those who live on the island, instead of the federal agencies, US corporations, and Wall Street bankers who exploited the island for profit for over 80 years and then left it in shambles. </p>

<p>I have two sources for those who are interested in bucking the propaganda machine: </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The US has never done anything in the best interest of the Puerto Rican people. I&#39;m not sure why anyone expects that something different is happening now. </p>

<p>Notice how Trump and his supporters focus on Puerto Rico&#39;s debt and use that to blame the people for not being prepared or being able to help themselves. Also notice how these same people never explain WHY Puerto Rico is so deep in debt. Exploitation by Wall Street, wide-spread austerity and privatization, and corruption by PR&#39;s puppet government are responsible for the debt — not the people of Puerto Rico, whose per-capita income is half that of the poorest state in the union. </p>

<p>I think this goes deeper than aid. Notice the timing of Trump&#39;s tax plan (tax cuts for the rich) and this narrative of blaming Puerto Ricans for problems caused by Wall Street and private companies. Puerto Rico is a shining example of how much damage is caused by privatization, austerity, and tax havens, and all are directly responsible for Puerto Rico&#39;s complete inability to recover from disaster without significant aid. Also notice how Trump has tried to create sympathy for private companies, like the shipping companies who wouldn&#39;t be able to overcharge Puerto Ricans in need of aid if the Jones Act was lifted. To highlight how the US has failed Puerto Rico — not just now, but ever since Puerto Ricans got citizenship — is to acknowledge that privatization and exploitation by bankers and corporations is deeply flawed. But that&#39;s Trump&#39;s vision for the mainland, so propaganda is in overdrive to skew the narrative.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s culmination of several things long before Trump existed, it&#39;s cowardly and/or greedy government officials in Puerto Rico much like the ones in Central and South America rolling over for big corporations and powerful western financial interest targeting the large amounts of both human and natural resources in that part of the world and its wars against  the middle class citizens of those nations to keep the resources of the homeland for themselves as well as fighting cruel and vicious working and living conditions at the time. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a story that has been played out many times not only in that region, but in Africa and Middle East as well as the Central Asia caucuses region. The brutal tactics of the West looking out for profits rather then people, OP only posted a segment of that brutal history.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I haven&#39;t looked deeply into what is being discussed in that post and I&#39;ll get back to you once I do, but it&#39;s interesting that you claim I&#39;m sucking up propaganda when my argument isn&#39;t based on news but on my own research and experiences talking to Puerto Ricans. And the post you&#39;re referring to mentions the news right off the bat. Further, my argument has little to do with Maria and the administration&#39;s response. My explanation for PR&#39;s debt crisis stands regardless of whether Trump is president or regardless of wether he supports Neoconservative profiteering. </p>

<p>In fact, I haven&#39;t seen anything in the MSM suggesting anything close to what I&#39;m laying out here. If you have any evidence otherwise, I&#39;d be interested in seeing it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just read the post and to be frank I think it&#39;s disinfo trying to shift blame from Trump to McCain/Graham, who the far-right have been trying to take down since Trump was elected. </p>

<p>To repeat myself, everything I&#39;m talking about in this post has to do with Puerto Rico&#39;s history long before Trump was elected and Maria hit. I started researching Puerto Rico 3 years ago, and the truth about privatization, tax havens, and austerity were true long before Trump ran on a platform of privatization, tax cuts, and austerity. We should be talking about these things regardless of whether or not Trump provided enough aid to Puerto Rico. Your and your friends&#39; arguments are hyper-focused on the current news cycle. Mine is based on over 100 years of colonialism and profiteering by a corrupt federal government, bankers, and billionaires. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a great example of the disinfo being spread around currently. I&#39;ve seen this talking point multiple times, without supporting evidence. Even a cursory knowledge of Puerto Rico&#39;s economy makes this argument absurd. Puerto Rico&#39;s economy is run entirely by federal agencies, basic services like roads and utilities are privatized, and most people and Puerto Rican business owners and farmers pay more in taxes than US corporations. To call it Marxism is pure propaganda. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>IMO brave new world is pointless. 1984 is infinitely more important and more well written. BNW is just set in a shitty dystopian future and the shock value of the shittyness/hedonism of it distracts from its lack of a good plot or any worthwhile ideas. I think it&#39;s the opposite of 1984 in the dystopian genre. Ayn Rand is the only person who has written anything in the dystopian genre worth reading outside of 1984</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Predicting drug addiction as technology allows for quicker manufacturing and distribution isn&#39;t profound it&#39;s just obvious. Also the way people were allowed to take it freely for fun is actually completely wrong if it&#39;s a prediction because the war on drugs is what actually happened and is an even bigger threat to freedom. Also gene altering is a thing now but it would be a huge jump from that to farming babies and eliminating parenthood as all children are raised in an intense brainwashing facility with no family connections. Saying BNW predicted biohacking is kinda true but it&#39;s no where near BNW like and would have to get really sinister for it to be an accurate prediction as it plays out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s just way too far a leap from the extreme of BNW. Plus doing something explicitly isn&#39;t the same as doing it deceptively, even if it&#39;s trying to do the same thing. 1984 captured the way the state brainwashes and deceives people into not seeing their evils, like real life. BNW has a society where everyone knows what&#39;s explicitly going on but doesn&#39;t care. That&#39;s not how the current world is and unless things change very drastically that part of BNW will make it out of touch </p>

<p>Thank you for the link. One does not have to &quot;read the entire book&quot; to learn something valuable, or to be drawn to then watch a film adaption and gain useful, pertinent understanding.</p>

<p>This &quot;kids these days don&#39;t even read&quot; diatribe is nonsense. Reddit is reading. Blogs are reading, Newspapers online. The entire world at our fingertips and still, some people are complaining that pencil use is not what it used to be.</p>

<p>Learning is learning. Thanks again for the link. I&#39;ll go read it. (you may or may not be surprised what all is available on Google Books.) I have an entire library of woodworking encyclopedias from the last century that I downloaded and burned to disc. I use it as reference when working on old furniture and housing carpentry. I sure as hell won&#39;t find that down at the Barnes &amp; Noble.</p>
