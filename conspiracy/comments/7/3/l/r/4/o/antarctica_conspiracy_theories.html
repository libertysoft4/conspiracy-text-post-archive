    <div class="md"><p>Bases:</p>

<p>Many bases, not as large as you&#39;d think, largest being able to hold a WW2 battleship and enough cargo to refuel it a few times. </p>

<p>In this day and age, there are more advanced bases than anything in the past, but nothing like you would think, more like portables that are close together, nothing spectacular, although there is no reason for a list of celebrities, and politicians to be making there way down there. </p>

<p>Hollow earth: Don&#39;t know, don&#39;t care, likely an ancient settlement is there, but nothing super advanced like what me way think, OR the exact opposite, something soo advanced that we can&#39;t truly grasp or understand it. </p>

<p>Besides is seclusion and privacy, there is nothing else it seems. </p>

<p>There may also be a magnetic phenomenon there that has something to do with the poles of the earth. </p>

<p>The privacy allows for unknown things to happen there, and that is why there were many weather radars showing a new HAARP built underwater seemingly near Antarctica, pretty sure videos of this on youtube have been suppressed already, but that is why you see wave anamolys and shit coming from Antarctica. </p>

<p>Shit is going on down there, but we can only speculate, we have to work with the knowledge we have. </p>

<p>If you want to start: Look for the HAARP at antarctica, there were videos on youtube showing it and they all went down, cannot find them anymore, its a grid of sometype underwater next to Antarctica. </p>

<p>Other than that, I have no clue what else to tell you. </p>

<p>Revised Google Earth 2.0 image of the Antarctic Grid on the bottom of the ocean off the coast of Antarctica</p>

<p>The website this comes from is horrible, but this is the grid, I have tried locating it but can&#39;t find anything else, all the youtube videos have been taken down. There are wilder theories for these grids than just HAARP man. </p>

<p>I provided proof, the proof is being scrubbed off youtube and the internet, this grid is located in the area where the anamoly waves that have been recorded in the past few months originate from, but the videos on youtube have ALL been removed.

<p>I&#39;ve heard these theories before. There are articles about them. But by no means is a random redditor expected to spoon-feed you a thesis paper when someone was just asking for a fucking list.</p>

<p>See something that piques your interest? Dig in. This is a jumping off point.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I read somewhere that there is an ancient genetic repository housed in one of the pyramids there. Its like a massive seed bank. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve also read how many different governments and organizations are there doing covert military research and human experimentation (on genome, cloning). </p>

<p>Finally, I&#39;ve read how there have been old craft discovered there from ET races which are still being uncovered and excavated. These include many exotic technologies and there were even beings found in stasis within. </p>

<p>Is any of this true? Well assuming the Earth isn&#39;t flat, I&#39;d assign about a 33.3% chance of any of these being true.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m obsessed with Antarctican conspiracies. </p>

<p>One there have been ancient maps depicting the continent, and a good chance that it was a lush beautiful place before becoming a giant ice burg. So theories of lost civilizations/atlantis type of stories are fun to entertain. Could just be wilderness too, but there&#39;s something under the ice. 
&amp;nbps;</p>

<p>There&#39;s also Andrew Byrd, a well respected admiral who spent a lot of his life on explorations of Antartica, claiming there is a land mass as great as the United States that is still left unexplored by humans.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;
Then of course just the way an international treaty protects it is so peculiar too. There&#39;s all these banks trying to buy out water sources like it&#39;s not a human right, and one would think Antarctica would be optimal.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;
Overall though, I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if the &quot;secrets of Antarctica&quot; are a more boring answer, like scientists just studying bacteria and microbes in insanely cold climates. Or even just preserving nature</p>
