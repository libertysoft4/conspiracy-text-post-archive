<p>In regards to crime within the United States, there are three aspects that must be established before guilt can be determined: Means, Motive, and Opportunity.</p>

<p>The US Government is scheduled to declassify documents related to the JFK assassination within three days. And there are many people that have the legitimate concern that the United States may have committed a crime, in manipulating these classified documents.</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>Means</strong></p>

<p>How exactly could they do this? I would think that is pretty obvious - they collect all of the evidence and documentation, and sit on it for a while, to let the conspiracy theorists attack every angle - essentially doing the legwork for them (idea generation). Then, they just doctor all of the documents, adding or removing as they see fit, until it paints the narrative that they want: that the government is innocent, and all adverse actions were taken by rogue elements.</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>Motive</strong></p>

<p>Your governemnt NEVER wants to be the bad guy, past present or future. The government very very badly wants to NEVER look like they did something wrong, ever, or could possibly be doing something wrong now, or is planning on doing something wrong in the future. Any appearances to the contrary cause the erosion of their authority, and loosen their grip on control over its citizens. And of course, they can&#39;t have this.</p>

<p>The average person might think &quot;you&#39;re kidding, right? It was 54 years ago, no one is interested in hiding the truth anymore.&quot; But they&#39;re wrong. The government has already established a solid history of illegal and immoral behavior, including domestic terrorism, genocide, and plenty of flase flag operations (that last one being one of their favorites, btw). If they admit that the assassination of JFK was indeed a conspiracy, that will only serve to set in stone the reputation of the United States government and its agencies, as a bunch of scumbags who will never change. Not in 50 years, not in 100, not in 200. Not ever.</p>

<p>The government wants you to think that they cannot possibly be guilty of doing terrible things TODAY, and would never do a terrible thing TOMORROW, because they have &quot;proof&quot; that they didn&#39;t do terrible things YESTERDAY.</p>

<p>Or as one of our favorite authors so susinctly put it: &quot;He who controls the past controls the future. He who controls the present controls the past.&quot;</p>

<p>I know, I know. I quoted George Orwell. What a cliche. Shoot me. (umm, please don&#39;t, that was definitely a joke)</p>

<p>TLDR: the government of the United States desires to prevent worsening their reputation of being a bunch of morally bankrupt scumbags that are willing to do very illegal and immoral things in order to get what they want. Essentially, they see the truth as a really big PR problem, and if the JFK declassification could maybe not paint them in a bad light, that would be greeaaaaat.</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>Opportunity</strong></p>

<p>As all of the evidence and documentation is fully controlled by the government, over a period of 50 years, and with absolutely no oversight, this is basically a scenario where the fox is not only inside the hen-house - it OWNS it.</p>

<p>This is like the vast majority of internal investigations in police misconduct incidents. &quot;We investigated ourselves and found that we did nothing wrong.&quot;</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>A Worldwide Mental Health Epidemic</strong></p>

<p>While I am ragging on the United States right now, please remember that the types of behavior that I am describing are actually very common across the entire world, and that we are not the sole parties who are guilty of being morally bankrupt.</p>

<p>The problem  lies in the fact that no normal person actually seeks such dominating power - you essentially have to be some degree of a psychopath. The type of person who seeks such levels of power are not like the rest of us. The personalities of CEOs and Politicians and Tyrants all have much higher occurrences of narcissism, williness to lie, lack of empathy, willingness to manipulate others, inability to admit guilt, etc.</p>

<p>These personality disorders are not unique to the United States - they are found in every country in the world.</p>

<p>Our country is not perfect. But living here is far better than living most other places. Many people go out of their way to paint the United States as some great evil. But that is not the case. It is only some individuals who are evil. And unfortunately, those types of people like power.</p>

<p>With people in power who are very willing to do skirt morality, it is a logical conclusion that falsifying documents and grossly misrepresenting events is probably just business-as-usual.</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>Perpetuating Stereotypes</strong></p>

<p>In case you missed it: on September 10, 2017, it was reported that one of the seven volumes on Lee Harvey Oswald has gone missing.</p>

<p>Can someone please explain to me how this revelation occurs only one month before the target declassification date? How does something so critically important to the nation go missing? How is it possible that there are not copies of such important documents? How is it possible that no one has digitized and encrypted them? We&#39;re talking about the assassination of JFK, probably the first question that every president asks when they enter office.</p>

<p>There is no way that this volume has only just now gone missing. The most likely scenario is that the volume was intentionally removed a very long time ago, and they broke the news to us lowly citizens to soften the shock on October 26.</p>

<p>Furthermore, this missing volume aids the government&#39;s agenda to perpetuate the Conspiracy Theorist stereotype. The government doesn&#39;t want to paint a very clear and pretty picture of their innocence, that would be almost unbelievable. Instead, they are happy continuing the status quo, which is essentially unanswered questions. From the government&#39;s perspective: NEVER answer a question if you don&#39;t have to - the more &quot;facts&quot; you create, the more rope you give out to hang yourself with. Better to just leave everything unconfirmed and let the civilian sleuths do all the legwork for you, for what your next move should be, if any.</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>Corpus Delicti</strong></p>

<p>Even though we can show means, motive, and opportunity for the government lying to us through their teeth about JFK, the unfortunate reality is that it might be impossible to prove that any such crime has been committed. There is no proof, no smoking gun, no illumaniti numerological signs or horroscopes. 54 years is a VERY long time for a group to get their stories straight, and check things over again and again and again to make sure that every last track has been hidden.</p>

<p>There&#39;s nothing we can do about it, though. All I can ask is that you stay skeptical, and ask questions. Just because you cannot prove a crime has been committed, doesn&#39;t mean that it never happened. Be vigilent, and try to make sure no one has the opportunity to do it again. Stand up for the truth, and do what you believe in your heart is right and good.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If people think that anything will actually be found in this file, they are fooling themselves.  The point of covert actions is to keep them secret.  They aren&#39;t going to release Allen Dulles&#39; dayplanner and on November 22, 1963 it says &quot;Assassinate the president.</p>

<p>That being said, I&#39;m going to copy paste a post I put together about the assassination.</p>

<p>I spent a long time researching this.  I&#39;m probably older than most redditors and my thinking was this:  &quot;I have lived through many different presidents, congresses, and senates and yet we seem to keep marching in the same direction no matter who is in power.  So why is this?&quot;  So I started thinking back through each president.  I thought Jimmy Carter was a little strange, but as I thought back, I realized that Kennedy was the strangest of all.  So I decided to look into it.  What I realized is that I had no idea what was actually going on and there are facts that we simply can not ignore about the situation.  I believe that most people could understand what actually happened and how it has shaped our world today with about 10 hours of reading.  The hard part is communicating what happened in a credible manner since there are so many details, but here is my best shot at it.</p>

<p>Forgive me if I get a few details wrong, but this should be pretty accurate.</p>

<p>Essentially JFK and his administration began pursuing peace through diplomacy rather than through overt force and using covert operations to stage coup&#39;s.</p>

<p>To really understand this, you have to go back to the Dulles brothers, John Foster and Allen. They were partners at the big lawfirm, Sullivan and Cromwell. Through their positions in this law firm, they came into contact with very powerful people and represented very powerful companies. Sometimes, they found that their use of international law was not enough to meet the demands of their customers and &quot;friends&quot;.</p>

<p>Around 1951, Iran nationalized the oil industry there (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Persian_Oil_Company">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Persian_Oil_Company</a></p>

<p>) and many large firms lost access to that natural resource which made them loads of money. So, in order to regain control of those resources, an operation coming from within the CIA (Dulles was not yet director, but had been involved in the CIA for a long time recruiting German officers and others during WW2) was launched and named Operation Ajax. Kermit Roosevelt was sent into the country and provided money and other resources to people there who wished to overthrow Mossadegh (current leader). Once the situation became unstable enough, the US helped to install the Shah of Iran as their vassal dictator. This scenario has been carried out numerous times (well over 30, but the list in wikipedia that used to exist has been scrubbed) and should seem familiar to you as it is basically what happened in Ukraine by funneling resources through NGOs.</p>

<p>This was the beginning of the CIA covert regime change operations to seize control of strategic countries to exploit for reasons of power and resources. So let&#39;s fast forward to Cuba and the Bay of Pigs. Dulles was in charge of the CIA by this point and they, along with the Joint Chiefs, were determined to take control of Cuba and not back down from Russia because there was this perception that there was a great &quot;communist threat&quot;. Whether they actually believed that communism was an existential threat to everyone or used it as a convenient excuse to do what they wanted to (similar to the &quot;war on terrorism&quot; now) is up for debate.</p>

<p>So, in 1961, a group of rebels, trained and supplied by the US (hi ISIS) were to go into Cuba and overthrow Castro, bringing control of the island state to the US. Apparently there were notes in Dulles&#39; archives saying essentially that once they were on the beach, this would force Kennedy to use the might of the military, especially planes, to support the rebels in Cuba. Kennedy, in fact, did not do this when he found out what was going on (the CIA did not inform him this was going to happen) and left Dulles&#39; operation to fail and bring about his humiliation.</p>

<p>Another little known fact, is that we also sponsored a coup in France just a few days later which also failed, but the evidence linking it to the CIA was not as strong. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algiers_putsch_of_1961">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algiers_putsch_of_1961</a></p>

<p>and <a href="http://whowhatwhy.org/2015/10/20/jfk-assassination-plot-mirrored-in-1961-france-part-1/">http://whowhatwhy.org/2015/10/20/jfk-assassination-plot-mirrored-in-1961-france-part-1/</a> Kennedy, who spoke with de Gaulle during this, was to have offered his military support to help him but &quot;could not account for his own CIA&quot; or something very similar.</p>

<p>Then we had the Cuban missile crisis in 1962, which was resolved by John and Bobby Kennedy using diplomatic channels and agreeing to disarm missiles in Europe if Khrushchev withdrew his missiles from Cuba. This opened up a dialog between the Kennedy administration and Russia where they began working toward peaceful solutions to their differences. You can hear this in his &quot;Peace&quot; speech at American University shortly before his death. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fkKnfk4k40">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fkKnfk4k40</a></p>

<p>Many people who follow the conspiracy believe it was his &quot;secret society&quot; speech that got him killed. In fact, it was his pursuit of peace through diplomacy in the face of a policy of imperialism and direct conflict.</p>

<p>We have all heard the quote from JFK about shattering the CIA. He actually had begun this process by aiming at a 20% reduction by 1966. <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=KS-6XrdalGkC&amp;amp;pg=PA16&amp;amp;lpg=PA16&amp;amp;dq=JFK+CIA+staff+reduction&amp;amp;source=bl&amp;amp;ots=1iU6fXuREA&amp;amp;sig=94Y1SBSPaDI3-d6rJJcxgVpPLig&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwjcvc--7LTOAhWDKGMKHYsaCF4Q6AEIUzAH#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=JFK%20CIA%20staff%20reduction&amp;amp;f=false">https://books.google.com/books?id=KS-6XrdalGkC&amp;amp;pg=PA16&amp;amp;lpg=PA16&amp;amp;dq=JFK+CIA+staff+reduction&amp;amp;source=bl&amp;amp;ots=1iU6fXuREA&amp;amp;sig=94Y1SBSPaDI3-d6rJJcxgVpPLig&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwjcvc--7LTOAhWDKGMKHYsaCF4Q6AEIUzAH#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=JFK%20CIA%20staff%20reduction&amp;amp;f=false</a></p>

<p>So he had already managed to destroy the career of one of the most powerful people in the world (Dulles), was getting rid of the jobs of many CIA staff who had no qualms with violence and covert operations, and was in the process of de-escalating conflicts throughout the world, thus threatening the careers and livelihoods of many people within the military industrial complex.</p>

<p>Ray McGovern, former CIA analyst had this to say: <a href="http://www.salon.com/2016/02/07/intelligent_people_know_that_the_empire_is_on_the_downhill_a_veteran_cia_agent_spills_the_goods_on_the_deep_state_and_our_foreign_policy_nightmares/">http://www.salon.com/2016/02/07/intelligent_people_know_that_the_empire_is_on_the_downhill_a_veteran_cia_agent_spills_the_goods_on_the_deep_state_and_our_foreign_policy_nightmares/</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Well, John Kennedy had problems of the same kind, and he fired Dulles. And that was a no-no. You don’t fire people like Dulles. Kennedy embarked on a new course. He talked with Khrushchev, he had people, interlocutors, who talked with Castro, and, worst of all, he issued two executive orders, saying that 1,000 U.S troops would be pulled out of Vietnam by the end of 1963 and the bulk of the rest by 1965. He was going to give up Southeast Asia to the Commies, and God knows what would happen next with the dominoes falling and Indonesia, and my God… So he was killed by the “deep state.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You may have watched the movie &quot;JFK&quot; by Oliver Stone. In that movie, the character played by Donald Sutherland, &quot;Mr. X&quot;, was actually based on a man named Fletcher Prouty who ran covert operations in the CIA for years. He has said that James Douglass&#39; book &quot;JFK and the Unspeakable&quot; basically got it right.</p>

<p>So that&#39;s the story, sorry it is long, but there is so much to understand and if you read the books I listed above, then you will have a much better picture of our past and present.</p>

<p>Ooh.. you&#39;re right.  I got ray mcgovern and fletcher prouty confused!  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>And so, the question: Did Allen Dulles and other “cloak-and-dagger” CIA operatives have a hand in John Kennedy’s assassination and in then covering it up? In my view, the best dissection of the evidence pertaining to the murder appeared in James Douglass’s 2008 book, JFK and the Unspeakable. After updating and arraying the abundant evidence, and conducting still more interviews, Douglass concludes that the answer is Yes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thanks for pointing that out.  That&#39;s why I always make a point to say:  &quot;Forgive me if I get a few details wrong, but this should be pretty accurate.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There is no &quot;Secret societies&quot; speech only the President and the Press speech that happened on April 27th 1961 to the press club. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>While correct on the first part, I think this is being pedantic because in common parlance, people know that speech as his &quot;Secret Societies&quot; speech.</p>
