<p>I think it&#39;s time we get organised and try to bring about real change. That&#39;s what I&#39;m interested in. We have enough members to actually make a difference if we start getting involved and make a voice against corruption.</p>

<p>One of the ways we can do that is by voting or writing letters en masse. Perhaps protesting also.</p>

<p>oh we have that...but if anyone expects evidence to be mentioned by the media or addressed by the government, that&#39;s been traditionally unrealistic. It&#39;s not as if documentation doesn&#39;t exist. It&#39;s just ignored.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is a possibility, but I don&#39;t think so. The current market cap is $100 billion dollars. That&#39;s the value of all the bitcoin in the world.

<p>But looking at the history it has gone up 500% this year alone. As more people get involved the price increases. Now, that is true of any ponzi scheme, so yeah it could all evaporate. But that can happen with dollars too. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, I&#39;ll answer the 4th question first. Go to youtube and search for explanations of bitcoin. Before you spend a dime on this you really need to understand it. Give yourself a full month. Crypto is complicated and its not ready for users who don&#39;t understand what they are doing. But its not <em>that</em> complicated. You can wrap your head around it, it just takes a little time.</p>

<p>Once you can answer the above questions yourself you will be ready to invest. But I&#39;m not a dick, so I will answer for you.</p>

<p>1) Bitcoin is limited. There will only ever be 21 million of them and it is impossible to create them out of thin air. That&#39;s why people want to use it. You can&#39;t just print more bitcoin. The technical reasons behind this are what you need to learn for yourself in your own time. Don&#39;t take my word for it.</p>

<p>1a) It is impossible for anyone to seize your bitcoin. They don&#39;t exist in some central repository. The feds can make it illegal, but even then it would be near impossible to enforce that.</p>

<p>2) You need to protect your bitcoin yourself. Hackers are stealing bitcoin, but only from people who make mistakes. That&#39;s why I&#39;m telling you to educate yourself. Otherwise, yes you could get it stolen. If you do things right it will be perfectly safe. </p>

<p>3) Bitcoin is divisible to very small amounts. Basically, if subway accepted bitcoin, the cash register would show a QR code. You would scan it with your phone (or watch etc) and your digital wallet would send 0.00003 bitcoins to subway. Currently this is not practical which is why I suggest buying it and then forgetting about it for a few years.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hard video evidence, paper evidence of an actual imprisonable crime. Not some 360p shit that 90% of people can&#39;t see, and not redacted pages that show no actual proof that would hold up in court. This is evidence, and everything else is circumstantial and won&#39;t hold up in court alone. That doesn&#39;t mean it can&#39;t be used, we just need actual hard proof of crime occurring. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So we need to decide what we stand for and start writing about that.</p>

<p>I vote we tackle the federal reserve and the fight for internet freedom (represented by The USA Liberty Act, SOPA, and similar).</p>

<p>If we just group together for those two issues, we can actually make a difference instead of circlejerking each other on the internet.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s how we do it: We need to keep track of laws which relate to issues we care about, keep track of who votes for what laws, and write them letters. Vote bad lawmakers out of government. Support Bitcoin as a legal tender. Stuff like that will make a huge difference.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You seem pretty knowledgable, can you answer a few more things before I invest? (If you don&#39;t mind).</p>

<ol>
<li><p>To my understanding, the dollar is failing because of the federal reserve bank creating money out of nothing. What&#39;s going to prevent bitcoin from making the same mistake as the dollar? What&#39;s going to stop the federal reserve bank from assuming control of all bitcoins?</p></li>
<li><p>What&#39;s going to prevent some hacker from stealing my entire stash of bitcoin?</p></li>
<li><p>Since you can use bitcoin for a lot of things now, how does that work? It&#39;s worth like 5.5k now, right? So if I buy a subway sandwich, am I going to pay like 0.0001 bitcoins? How does that work?</p></li>
<li><p>Where can I learn more?</p></li>
