<p>If Trump manages to break the backs of big pharma by allowing Medicare to purchase bulk generics, I&#39;ll support it. I&#39;m a Bernie voter, but if Trump is willing to make some good policy decisions like that I&#39;m all for it. Not that it will earn him any slack come 2020 ;)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand that many people don’t like his approach and personality. But do you honestly value that over actual change?</p>

<p>I’d rather have an asshole that gives positive change versus the smooth-talking career politician that does very little. In a perfect world we’d have a leader that’s both sides of the coin but likely not the choice we are given.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I got into a big argument with a co-worker about this years ago.  He was arguing against subsidizing health care or heath insurance for people in America.  His position was basically no subsidies for any American period. </p>

<p>When I brought up the fact that Americans pay more for the exact same drugs other countries pay he said, &quot;Well yeah. That&#39;s because they can&#39;t afford it.&quot;</p>

<p>When I then said, &quot;Many Americans can&#39;t afford health care or health insurance.&quot;  He said something like &quot;pfft....bullshit.&quot; </p>

<p>I couldn&#39;t believe it and we went round and round about.  He thought it was all perfectly reasonable.</p>
