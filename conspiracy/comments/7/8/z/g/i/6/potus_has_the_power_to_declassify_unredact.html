<p>The people deserve to know the truth. </p>

<p>Please do not lie in our faces about redacting for national security. We aren’t stupid anymore. </p>

<p>While you are at it, declassify the 9-11 documents. </p>

<p>We already know Bush Sr was part of the JFK assassination and that the Bush and Clinton families were behind 9-11. </p>

<p>We know the Saudis and Israeli governments were involved in 9-11. </p>

<p>Don’t keep us waiting. Release the information now or you will regret not doing so when judgment day comes and the criminals are separated out and jailed. </p>

<p>I never want to hear someone on this sub tell me how Trump is different from any other president or is some kinda bright light in the &quot;globalist&quot; dark ever again. Bannon fooled you into thinking Trump lives outside the corrupt muck, it&#39;s time you make yourself aware of that so you can move past it, admit you were wrong, and proceed to fight the good fight.</p>

<p>Trump doesn&#39;t care about you.  He&#39;s lying right to your face and you will continue to defend him.</p>

<p>Trump&#39;s a friend of the Saudis and Israel. He&#39;s never tell you if they were involved in 9/11, not ever.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Classification stems from Article II of the constitution and is implemented by Executive Order. Most presidents actually modify the EO at whim to suit their purposes.</p>

<p>Therefore, Trump can indeed declassify anything he wants as all classification/declassification authorities are <strong>delegated</strong> from the presidents executie power. All classification is already just an extention.</p>

<p>Not only is this the popular belief, it&#39;s already been tested and fair ed in the Supreme Court. Likewise, legislation controlling declassification would actually be illegal and shot down in the courts.</p>
