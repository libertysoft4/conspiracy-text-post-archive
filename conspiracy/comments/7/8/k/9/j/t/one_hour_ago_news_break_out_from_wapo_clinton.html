    <div class="md"><p>I don’t think it is. It was also reported that the dossier was originally commissioned by an unnamed republican and the DNC picked it up with Fusion after the primary’s.

The FBI (Comey) apparently was going to put Steele on the payroll, but the deal fell through when Steele was outed in the press as the author of the dossier. Whether or not what the Obama admin did in coordination with the Clinton campaign and others to be able to spy on Trump was illegal, it was highly unethical and should disturb any rational thinking person whether you hate Trump or not. </p>

<p>That could mean anything and is why the dossier made general claims, so that aspects (such as X was in Y country) could be verified and give false presumptions of authenticity. Classic propaganda technique.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You guys know you have to actually provided evidence right?</p>

<p>Like, right? You get it? You have to actually show how it was debunked. Because regurgitating information we knew back in may about the DNC doing opposition research doesn&#39;t disprove the actual contents of the research.</p>

<p>Here. This is how you would prove something using proof.</p>

<p>&quot;Member that time Trump Jr literally released emails that showed him directly planning a meeting with Russians who made it clear they were offering official russian government aid? Member that? Member when he admitted to literal collusion with a foreign government?&quot;</p>

<p>Now. I know this can be difficult for you folks, but see what I did there is I used actual things, for instance Trump Jrs actual emails, to show that something happened. In this case, it&#39;s his working as a representative of his fathers campaign to illegally work with the russian government to sabotage a political rivals campaign.</p>

<p>You know. That thing we said he did. </p>
