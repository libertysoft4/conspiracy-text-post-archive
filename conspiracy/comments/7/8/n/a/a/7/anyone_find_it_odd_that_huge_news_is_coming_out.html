<p>And besides, if Trump&#39;s opposition research turned up illegal things in the Clinton campaign, would you object to <em>that</em> being investigated?

<p>The Russian lawyer that Don Jr met with, had met with Fusion GPS a month prior. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fusion GPS is a D.C. opposition and research firm founded by an ex-Wall Street Journal writer.  They have lots of different clients.  I hate the genre of &quot;These two people both hired the same vendor therefore they&#39;re connected.&quot;  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>This meeting and the dossier is what was used in FISA court to approve the wiretapping on Trump and his associates.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The FISA warrants were on Paul Manafort because it appeared he was laundering money for eastern European tyrants.  There was also an open investigation into Carter Page, because he had been contacted by Russian spy recruiters.  The government didn&#39;t get the Steele dossier until much later, when its contents freaked John McCain out enough for him to forward it to the DOJ last summer or fall.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Yes, that&#39;s the nonsense Fox News and The Donald are trying to talk themselves into.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yup. Starting to look like the Jeb campaign started the dossier research, but DNC continued paying for it. People think the DNC and the &quot;GOP Donor&quot; (who was probably supporting Jeb) made up the dossier. They only paid for a list of dirt to be uncovered and itemized. Trump was a wild card both the Republican and Democratic party didn&#39;t want to be president. Establishment or not, this was in the end a non partisan paper. </p>

<p>I&#39;m still trying to figure out what the big gotcha is. If a Trump donor had started a Clinton dossier, I&#39;d be like, cool sounds like something politicians do when running against a candidate in a large political race. Unless the outage is just that people paid to dig up dirt on Trump, then why is it different for Trump to want to dig up dirt on Clinton?</p>

<p>The problem, but you know this already, is that Clinton payed to have the dossier manufactured (not &quot;dug up&quot;), and then that manufactured &#39;evidence&#39; was used to obtain a FISA warrant to spy on the Trump campaign.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So does that mean the president would not be considered a credible individual to testify in court? I do believe that once you&#39;ve shown yourself to be a passive liar (you lie just to lie, either bc it&#39;s inherent to your nature - we&#39;ve all met chronic liars who can&#39;t help it - or you have been lying so long about stuff for personal or business reasons that you can&#39;t stop yourself) that everything you say needs to be validated against a more trustworthy source.</p>

<p>Like, I&#39;m not going to believe the boy who cried wolf that a wolf is coming until a second person goes &quot;oh yeah mate, there&#39;s a wolf coming, I saw it too&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So the problem with the bot activity is that all we know is that the bots come through Russian IP space.  I am no computer security expert, but as someone who does manage a few small websites, I do know that a very large portion of electronic hacking comes through Russian IP space.  Why?  Because it is almost impossible to track back due to the political and legal enmity between the US and Russia.  If you are a computer hacker in the US and want to fuck up someone&#39;s shit, the way to do it is via VPN through Russia because nobody is going to be able to track you home.</p>

<p>So, we have bots coming from Russian IP space.  Are they affiliated with the Kremlin?  Are then DNC bots proxied through Russian IP space?  Are they an unaffiliated 3rd party?  Nobody (so far as I know) has been able to actually answer this question.</p>

<p>On the other hand, we have the Kremlin funneling a fair bit of money through the European Centre for a Modern Ukraine to the Podesta Group via Paul Manafort, and this whole Uranium One situation.</p>

<p>The 2015 Ukrainian coup was dirty.  I&#39;m not sure of the players and I have no proof, but it has been my opinion since then that Russia is indeed meddling in American politics but aligned with the DNC/CIA axis.  In looking at the pieces of the puzzle that are visible and the actual facts on the ground, this is more of the picture that is supported.</p>

<p>Just my opinion.  Worth nothing at all.  I&#39;m really looking forward to seeing what Mueller comes up with, especially with this business about digging into Manafort&#39;s involvement with the Podesta Group.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My only problem with this line of thought is that you can&#39;t just unmask someone. It isn&#39;t just &quot;click this button to unmask&quot; it&#39;s a bureaucratic process. You also don&#39;t get to unmask just anyone. In one of the conditions, have to show that the unmasking is crucial to determining the context of what you&#39;ve found. <strong>You don&#39;t know who you are unmasking</strong>, this is why it is called an unmasking and not &quot;oh yeah we totally know who this is, but can you replace PERSON1 with their name, thanks&quot;.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry, but if our IC found information to be unmasked and it turned out to be HClinton smuggling children or DTrump smuggling children, I wouldn&#39;t care who it was smuggling children.</p>

<p>Same goes for this political arena. I&#39;ve been in the conspiracy game too long to just accept Susan Rice and the DNC wanted to fabricate a story around DTrump that would sink his ship. What I do believe - is that they and the other GOP options for presedential nomination would definetly pay big bucks to uncover truths, crimes and moral ambiguities that DTrump has been involved with throughout his life. The same way I&#39;d expect the Trump camp to pay big bucks to uncover truths, crimes and moral ambiguities that HClinton has been involved with throughout her life. </p>

<p>As someone who literally does this for a living, &quot;long and detailed&quot; and &quot;produced in a matter of hours&quot; usually means that the report was already written long beforehand.</p>

<p>Also, we don&#39;t know it &quot;to be completely false&quot;.

<p>Also, the FISA warrant was issued for <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/09/18/politics/paul-manafort-government-wiretapped-fisa-russians/index.html">Manafort</a>, not Trump. There were two actually, both before <em>and</em> after his involvement with the Trump campaign.

<p>It started as GOP opposition research, most likely by the Jeb camp. Then when Trump gets the nomination, GOP is like &quot;welp, not gonna pay for this anymore&quot; to which DNC slides in and goes &quot;oh we got this&quot; and continues funding the effort. Also the dossier&#39;s author is a well known IC member Christopher Steele. He worked for the Brits. This is like trying to say Bill Gates&#39; advice on computers would be knowingly false, despite him being you know, Mr. Computer. If you don&#39;t like that example, swap in any respected member of the computing field instead of Gates.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If it turns out that the DNC and the GOP and the FBI were working together to take down the President, this could be the biggest story in the history of American politics.</p>

<p>They weren&#39;t working to take down - they were looking for political information to use in political ads, debates, the presidential primary, etc. It wasn&#39;t created so &quot;<strong>when</strong> Trump becomes president, we&#39;ll have some gotchas!&quot; it was created for <strong>before</strong> the election-vote activities.</p>

<p>The biggest thing we need to remember is who STARTED the dossier? It was a GOP donor (again most likely in the Jeb camp). This tells us that it started as any other type of opposition research. Which, imho, takes a lot of the steam out of the dossier short of it just being opposition research that I wouldn&#39;t be shocked any candidate paid to have done.</p>

<p>If I paid to have the background of a neighbor who might beat me in this year&#39;s neighborhood Christmas decoration contest and I find out through the paid research that they are smuggling children across the border or heroin or cocaine....would you a third party be yelling more about the fact I had the background research done...or what the background research found?</p>

<p>I feel like too many of us are getting stuck on the creation when we should be focusing on the results. I don&#39;t get mad that the doctor ran my blood work and found cancer.

<p>In the end, this dossier is nothing but more smoke and mirrors as pushed from the right wing MSM in this country.

<p>What results?  You mean the sham investigation of President Trump for collusion which originated from bogus opposition research and the DNCs examination of their own servers?  Everything here leads us to believe that the DNC took their “evidence” of collusion to the FBI and that the FBI (mostly Comey) used that to target Trump <em>after</em> he had already won the election. </p>

<p>The truth is that A. The dossier is bullshit opposition research and it’s meaningless.  But B. The problem is that meaningless, inaccurate, partisan opposition research is being used in an attempt to impeach the President of the United States.</p>

<p>Yeah. Not sure the extent to which it was used. But you seem to think it must mean there&#39;s some crookedness here. I don&#39;t think that&#39;s necessarily true, especially considering what we now know about Manafort, Page, etc.</p>

<p>Comey and Brennan stated unequivocally that they were using the dossier in their investigation.</p>

<p>When has any other opp research been hand delivered to the FBI for use in a presidential investigation?  This is clear and simple.  DNC dug up bogus dirt.  They lied about it for a year.  They gave that bogus dirt to the FBI who used it to attack President Trump.  It doesn’t get any dirtier than that.</p>

<p>Nigga, what? Once again, you seem incapable of recognizing that the &quot;fake&quot; (it&#39;s not fake you nitwit) document may have only been a part of the case to geet a FISA warrant (that wasn&#39;t even for Trump). Conveniently, you ignore the facts about guys like Manafort and Page though. Nice. I can tell you&#39;re a Trumpanzee.</p>

<p>Read that article homeboy. Brennan says they didn&#39;t use it and Comey says he isn&#39;t going to discuss. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s been common knowledge that anti-Trump GOP candidates started the process and the DNC picked it up when it was clear Trump was going to win the GOP primary. WaPo updated their article to show the Clinton campaign was involved, so the campaign involvement might not have been as widely accepted. </p>

<p>The Republican donor hired Fusion in September 2015, according to an account in the New York Times. But once Trump won the Republican nomination, the GOP donor lost interest. But in spring 2016, Fusion was able to persuade donors to Hillary Clinton to keep funding the research. (Update, Oct 24:The Washington Post reported that the Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee funded the research.)</p>

<p>I don&#39;t even support Trump, but this is beyond naive, every thread is like this, there is an intense echo chamber here and I don&#39;t think the people realize where the first voices are coming from.</p>

The worst of it (that I noticed) was during the time Obama was pushing Obamacare.

Every comment was cricle jerking how great health care was about to be. If you search Obamacare with Top and All Time, that propaganda has been removed and now all that remains are stories talking about how stupid Trump is to try and repeal it. </p>

<p>This is based on the faulty assumption that the dossier could only be made with cooperation with the russian government, which is pulled out of your ass. The difference is the email chain said the meeting was about the russian governments support of trump, to which jr said I Love it! </p>

<p>She worked for a company that also EMPLOYED the company who did the dossier to get info on a case of theirs, that is a large distinction.</p>

<p>Who is calling for DonJr to be arrested based on just that meeting happening? we don&#39;t know exactly what the info even was, the point made by the email chain is that when they say &quot;golly gee we would never get help from the russians!&quot; we know they would glady do it if given the opportunity.</p>

<p>The deflection to the left is also very different, as a person went over to ukraine, and worked with a ukranian journalist on information in public records.</p>

<p>Having contacts in russia is not the same thing as the russian government helping make it. In this case, &quot;trusted compatriots&quot; of those high up sources gave steele the secondhand information in exchange for cash. </p>

<p>Your entire point is that the dossier could only have been made with the russian govt&#39;s help, so now that we know hillary&#39;s campaign helped fund it, that means she colluded with the russians. That&#39;s like saying the NYTimes colluded with the trump administration everytime they get a leak.</p>

<p>So it doesn&#39;t matter that Clinton paid someone to talk with Kremlin agents, but it matters that Trump Jr. talked with someone who was, at one point, paid for by the Kremlin. </p>

<p>She runs the law firm now? also were you lying, or just stupid and don&#39;t read your own sources when you said she worked for them?</p>

<p>Yes there is a big distinction on if they hired an investigator who got leaked information from kremlin agents, and if the kremlin handed the information to the investigator to help clinton. Do you really not see that or are you this desperate for the narrative reversal?</p>

<p>As I said, I don&#39;t even care who it was trump jr met with or what their ties were(we cant ever prove what was said or exchanged in that meeting so it is moot) I care about what we know trump jr/manafort/kushner thought the meeting was, which was information directly from the russian government to help Trump win the election.</p>

<p>This is where you&#39;re being extremely hypocritical. You care about where Trump Jr. <em>thought</em> he was getting information from. You don&#39;t care that Clinton thought she was getting insider Russian information. </p>

<p>If you&#39;re going to say &quot;Clinton didn&#39;t know Steele would talk to the Russians!&quot; then you&#39;d be lying. She know who Steele was. She knew what kind of contacts he had. </p>

<p>The differences here are 1) Who reached out to who, and 2) Someone spent campaign funds on their collusion. That&#39;s really it. You, as you&#39;ve said, care about Trump but not about Clinton. </p>

<p>The Democrats created these rules, we are to care about any and every interaction with Russia during the election. These are the rules (what appears to be) your team created. Either play by them or admit you&#39;re biased and you don&#39;t wanna face the music about your own team. </p>

<p>You&#39;re making a strawman that I think &quot;anyone talking to a russian ever&quot; is the issue, which it is not. The comparable example would be if steele had told hillary &quot;the russian government wants to help you beat trump so, they will give me a dossier of info on bad things he&#39;s done&quot; and hillary replied &quot;I Love it!&quot; even if that dossier was complete bunk or didnt exist, accepting that offer would not look good.</p>

<p>Oooh, so the Trump Jr. meeting isn&#39;t important because no information was gathered from it? Last I checked the DNC, the media, and their lackeys spent months talking about it. Hell, they&#39;re still talking about it. Not only that, how many times were the Wikileaks emailed &quot;discredited&quot; because &quot;Assange is a Putin pawn!&quot; </p>

<p>So the story is.. if a democrat gathers information, it doesn&#39;t matter who or where it came from.. or how they got it. However, if anyone gathers information about the democrats, the only thing that matters is the messenger. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You realize that paying a firm to gather opposition research is <em>legal</em>, and that working with a foreign government to affect an election is <em>illegal</em>, right?</p>

<p>You&#39;re conflating the two when there&#39;s a striking difference. The dossier was opposition research: someone paid someone else to find Trump&#39;s dirty secrets (it&#39;s called politics).</p>

<p>The accusations against Trump is that he partnered with a foreign government (illegal) and used their help (illegal) to affect the outcome of the US election (illegal).</p>

<p>If Hillary or the DNC paid the Russian government to gather the dirt, that would be illegal.</p>

<p>The problem is, you&#39;re making assumptions. This is not a matter of &quot;anyone gathering information&quot;, it&#39;s a matter of Don Jr. releasing his own emails which show he met with someone <em>claiming</em> to be representative of a foreign government.</p>

One way to start to unravel this is allowing a candidate or anyone supporting a particular candidate to receive campaign donations from US Citizens that are registered voters in the candidate&#39;s voting district.  Examples: A Congressman can only receive campaign support from voters in his district; a Senator could only receive funding from registered voter in his State.  Since we do not directly elect President and Vice President, only the state candidates for the electoral college could receive campaign funding.     </p>
