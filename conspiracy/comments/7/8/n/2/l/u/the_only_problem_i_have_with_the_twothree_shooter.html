    <div class="md"><p>There was a video here a couple days ago where a Marine combat vet opined that the death + injury rate was way too high. He said a single shooter from that position using that gun could not hit that many people. Not with a bump stock, and (iirc) not even with a fully automatic rifle. It seemed counter-intuitive to me, but then again, I&#39;ve never been in a war, so how would I know, right? </p>

<p>Do you have any proof they existed except for what you&#39;ve seen in the media?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The hospitals and the EMTs and the Police and the coroner and the families and friends of the deceased are all in on it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why would that be necessary? For example, if a busy hospital sees a rush of patients, ostensibly from this &#39;shooting&#39;, how many staff do you think see a single patient from admission all the way through to surgery and release?</p>

<p>Create enough fuss and a few people playing along with the act and most staff will act like total bystanders, assuming &quot;someone else&quot; is treating the guy who died, or that girl with the gunshot wounds.</p>

<p>It&#39;s all an illusion. A magic trick. A total fraud.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The people &quot;in on it&quot; are likely a travelling circus of professional military drill specialists who do this all over the world. It&#39;s not that hard to envisage.</p>

<p>They can&#39;t reveal what they do to anyone because nobody would believe them anyway. Just look at this sub, once a narrative is in motion even hardened skeptics fall for it... or so it appears.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m certainly not going to change my opinion when there is absolutely no evidence to suggest that nobody died but there is video footage and pictures and victims names and family members and hospital workers and coroners and emergency responders etc., who all corroborate the idea that an actual shooting happened with actual victims.  22,000 people at the concert who were eye-witnessing people being shot and they were all having a mass hallucination.. or were they all in on it also?  It&#39;s just ridiculous the amount of hoops you have to jump thru to convince yourself that no shooting actually happened.  It&#39;s way harder to fake a shooting than it would be to actually shoot people so if this whole thing was a false flag why wouldn&#39;t they just actually carry out a shooting?
