Whether there were real victims, whether there weren&#39;t or whether the number was inflated, is less relevant to figuring out the motives behind the attack as MSM isn&#39;t really pushing any political narratives. </p>

<p>Although I choose to not believe SH was fake, it being fake is much more relevant to that scenario. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve not come across anyone who flat out doesn&#39;t believe mass casualty events actually happen.</p>

<p>But there are plenty of people who question the validity of <em>certain</em> mass casualty events, sure. There are probably mass casualty events  happening every day around the globe; but they don&#39;t all make the &quot;news&quot;.
When they do, it&#39;s for a reason.</p>

<p>&quot;Events&quot; which clearly promote particular agendas certainly need to be questioned. Especially on the <em>conspiracy</em> sub, I would have thought.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is it really surprising that people personally affected by events have an opinion on the subject? </p>

<p>I live in Sandy Hook. I saw the aftermath (not the bodies can we not go there) in town and it was quite eye opening for me, as it showed how little evidence it takes to get a lot of conspiracy folks calling hoax and perpetuating some stories about the kids not being killed, while defending those beliefs venomously. It would take a ridiculous amount of local cooperation to make 26 locally known people disappear, classes in session in a supposedly closed (school was definitely in session I see the busses in the morning) school, etc etc. </p>

<p>Did I see the actual shooting, of course not. Does it mean there wasn&#39;t some kind of operation or agenda behind it, also no. It could have been a planned event for something I guess. But to say it didn&#39;t even happen is ridiculous. To visit the parents homes and call them liars is horrendous and inhuman. </p>

<p>If you really think these black ops groups that would have perpetrated this event, if it was indeed a false flag, have any qualms about killing children, they do it regularly. Maybe not in the US but abroad for sure. Entire villages eradicated. What do they care?</p>

<p>If you can&#39;t accept witness testimony from regular people who have no reason to lie, why even bother researching an event? You guys have no prob pointing to some joe shmoe firefighter talking about explosions on 911, but someone who lives in the little town who just got rocked by a mass shooting is a shill?? Confirmation bias works both ways guys.</p>

To me there&#39;s enough evidence that they&#39;re not telling us EVERYTHING openly and transparently about that day. There&#39;s a spectrum of what doesn&#39;t &quot;feel right&quot; about the story to different people. </p>

<p>Sure - some people might question the entire thing. Just like some people completely believe the events to have taken place the exact way we were told. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never thought Sandy Hook was 100% hoax. But I have some serious questions about it. Las Vegas has muddied the waters for me though. I live here, right by MB, and I heard the shots and screams. So, the people who call it all a hoax are obviously frustrating. Although I have lived here all my life, and I do not know a single person effected by the shooting. </p>

<p>Seeing how this was handled makes me reconsider aspects of SH. I think both these events shine a bright light on the actual problem. That LEOs lie to us about everything. If they were just honest in the smallest fucking way...ever...it would defuse a lot of the people who think everything is a hoax. But they won&#39;t, time after time we are lied to by LEOs and the media. So, the hoax theories are frustrating, but I can&#39;t blame anyone for thinking that.</p>
