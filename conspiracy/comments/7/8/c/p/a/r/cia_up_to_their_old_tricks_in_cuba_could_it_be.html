        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Here are some ideas on a solution to the mystery of the &#39;acoustic attacks&#39; suffered by US employees of the Cuban Embassy (dare I say former mystery!)
Political considerations first...
   1) We all know that the CIA/Mafia cojoined twin monster has always held a grudge over losing their casinos and lucrative cash cow in Havana (due to Fidel Castro revolution). Like a spoiled boy on his back on the floor, they continue to whine, cry and stamp their feet in a tantrum, even after near 70 years beyond the fact (they just can&#39;t let it go)
2) In addition, there is the CIA grudge against anything out of Cuba, as the island has been such a focus of FAILED operations for years, it is just a continuing sore spot. Trying to kill Castro hundreds of times with numerous schemes and failing every time! tends to make one&#39;s group look like a bunch of idiots.
3) A desire for the continued isolation of Cuba seems to be part of the DNA of the CIA, they cannot purge it, and perhaps have even forgotten the reason why they hate Cuba in the first place.
4) The Obama opening to Cuba was perhaps a surprise to the Intel community. I theorize that Obama wished to have this as part of his legacy (a decent undertaking...blessed are the peacemakers), but the Cuban exiles of Florida, as well as the CIA cannot be embarassed or insulted in this way, it&#39;s sort of an insult to their perceived manhood.
  Well enough on this, I think we all understand the CIA is the perennial actor in Cuba and they are the likely suspect in nearly every instance no matter what happens there. In addition, there seems to be ABSOLUTELY NO motive for anyone in Cuba to damage ties with the US (by harming people with mysterious somethings). The Cuban government seems sincerely baffled by these events, they have publicly stated that they would not do this, and seem believable. Just because you are a poor country does not mean that you do not have honor, maybe just the opposite is true.
Technical considerations
1) The US Navy sponsored search for a &quot;harm&quot; weapon, entitled MEDUSA, is now somewhat old news. It was intended as a perimeter defense device, ie it is annoying enough to send you packing if you try to jump their fence. It can also do physical damage  as microwaves can actually &#39;cook&#39; you from the inside out. It seems microwaves tend to be in their &#39;element&#39; in an H2O environment, my way of saying they work best in a &quot;water mass&quot; environment. This would account for the brain damage experienced by staffers. Likely the microwaves are also affecting other tissues, but since the brain is relatively more flooded with fluid (blood), the brain is proportionally affected more.
2) I theorize microwaves perhaps in the D-band (somewhat more lethal) were put to use. Commercial kitchen microwaves would be less powerful, and safer, and we&#39;ve all seen what they can do. Since microwaves travel in a manner similar to lasers-straight line of sight path- they make for a pretty useful possible weapon.
3) A device that pulses microwave radiation need not be too bulky. Only a magnetron, &quot;pulser device mod&quot; and perhaps some targeting or sighting would be needed. I theorize a lithium electric drone could even handle this task. Since you are not hoisting heavy air to ground missiles, you don&#39;t need a Predator type drone. A small drone device could be very quiet and effective. Also let&#39;s not forget there is a permanent US military base not far away from Havana. They wouldn&#39;t be up to no good would they?
4) The fact that many employees affected actually were staying in a multi-story hotel actually lends credence to a possible drone mounted attack. Picture it in your mind....it would be difficult to target a particular hotel FLOOR from an overhead, satellite launched attack, but a drone positioned horizontally a few miles away could easily direct a beam at any desired floor of said hotel, just like you could look into any room to spy on people there if you are in the hotel across the street. The beam would be traveling roughly parallel to the earth&#39;s surface. This would also account for witness accounts describing the beam active in one area of the room but not another part! Picture it like a person shining a laser pen into the room from across the street, except you don&#39;t see microwaves.
5) The mystery attacks where described as sonic, perhaps for a number of reasons. Microwaves actually can induce the illusion of hearing sound via the Frey affect. Normally sound waves hit the outer ear, vibrate the drum which cases nerves to detect it as sound. Microwaves in contrast vibrate these same components of the ear from the inside, so there is no ACTUAL sound, the victim merely has the illusion of hearing a sound because his or her inner ear is being vibrated, thus producing sound messages to the brain, the only difference is the brain doesn&#39;t know what is causing the inner ear to be vibrated. A second reason for the sound might be the intentional inclusion of a noise maker component to throw off victims, though this complicates the whole argument and I feel is not credible. Directing microwaves from miles away is easy, throwing sound that far is not. I would have to stick to the Frey Effect line of explanation</p>

<p>Semi conclusions
  There has been a long history of the US military experimenting on unwitting subjects, even on school children in the upper Eastern USA during the Cold War (aerosol attacks with chemicals used to test possibilities of Soviet attacks against US targets). See youtube or videos on this. It is clearly not beyond the realm of possibility that the CIA would harm US citizens in order to achieve one of the bedrock goals of that agency, ie to hobble and cripple the Cuban government and keep Cuba from flourishing and joining the nations of the world as an equal</p>

<p>Summary-        I believe the CIA purposely harmed US government employees with a MEDUSA type weapon in Cuba, in order to be able to blame this on the Cuban authorities, the end result being a much worsening of relations between the two nations. All the pieces fit.</p>
