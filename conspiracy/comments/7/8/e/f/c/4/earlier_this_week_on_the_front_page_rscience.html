    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s because of &quot;free speech&quot; they really only get rid of accusations of shilling. IMO not strict moderation is how subs die, at a certain number of subscribers (let&#39;s call this the shitpost horizon) the quality of the sub goes way down because people are morons and don&#39;t know what fits in what sub. Basically look at all the defaults, it&#39;s all shit. But then look at r/polandball, the mods are Nazis but the quality is always high. Or even the_donald while I don&#39;t agree with them they have a super high &quot;quality&quot; because they only want shitposts. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would say t_d is a horrible example, because half the moderation they do is simply removing people that don&#39;t adhere to the exact message they want to project..</p>

<p>This sub doesn&#39;t need that kind of moderation. If there&#39;s 12 posts about one specific tweet, and there&#39;s genuine interest in it, removing the other 11 doesn&#39;t effect free speech, it just means everyone can discuss things in the same place.. instead of the sub being clogged with 12 posts of the same thing, times 100 posts like that.</p>

<p>I think there&#39;s an actual effort at forum sliding, and to start removing duplicate posts that don&#39;t say anything differently is going to clean this place up, and more posts get more visibility.</p>

<p>I mean, I just saw a post about &quot;censorship in r/science&quot; that&#39;s just a screenshot of posts that say &quot;removed&quot;. How many of these posts do we need that don&#39;t actually add to anything, aren&#39;t an actual conspiracy.</p>

<p>Maybe you&#39;re right, non default subs try harder at moderation.. but it&#39;s obvious the mods don&#39;t care if our sub is being manipulated.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree absolutely.. and things that are considered &quot;shitposts&quot; should stay in places like the Donald.. things have gotten bad, and I really am curious what the mods views on these issues are.

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah it&#39;s so blatant too, you can click new and see so many shit posts pulled from r/politics that have nothing to do with conspiracy and a few comments about how liberals are trying to destroy traditional beliefs. WHY THE FUCK are the mods not removing these clear shit posts with nothing conspiracy related. I think I&#39;ll start reporting them myself, but I doubt one person can do much.

    <div class="md"><p>I think the only thing we can do, is report it every time we see it. If enough people keep doing it, mods will have to respond to it at some point.</p>

<p>Look at my very last comment, it&#39;s a guy from the Donald, that copied someone else&#39;s post, then pastes it in 5 other places in the same post.</p>

<p>This is exactly the kind of shit that&#39;s truly destroying this sub, and I would love to see the moderators do something about it, because each day this sub is less enjoyable to participate in, made worse by having to sift through garbage to find something even worthy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, there has been a concerted effort to stigmatize conspiracy theorists for a long time. Even the term itself is manufactured. Really picked up steam around the time of 9/11. Still going strong though. Btw, if you guys don&#39;t know you can BUY Reddit upvotes (I had a client who used a service to do this, almost got to the front page)</p>

<p>It&#39;s now associated with &quot;crazy&quot;, &quot;nuts&quot;, &quot;mentally unstable&quot;.</p>
