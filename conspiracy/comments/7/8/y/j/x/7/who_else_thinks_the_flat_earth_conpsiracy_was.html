I think it started a few years back when some jokers from the Church Of The Subgenius looked around for the most bizarre and ridiculous conspiracy theory they could find and reboot it for the shits and giggles thereafter.

    <div class="md"><p>Most if not all flat earthers identify as fundamentalist Christians who take their FE cues from the Bible. I am not a Christian (any longer) in part because I could not reconcile the dichotomy between Biblical belief and scientific truth. Science says the Earth is a globe, and I find that easier to accept than the beliefs of a bunch of nomadic goat herders who had no idea where the sun went at night. In fact I don&#39;t find FE belief any more bizarre than much of the rest of the Christianity story. Unicorns and talking donkeys? Really? At least Harry Potter states clearly on the cover that it&#39;s fantasy fiction.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh we can fly around it, but just not over the poles...sorry I forgot. We can explore anywhere in the world but not the North Pole or Antarctica.  The whole boat sailing over the horizon has been debunked many a time...you&#39;ve obviously haven&#39;t researched much if you still believe that line. There are many videos online with people going to the beach and focusing on a boat &quot;going over the horizon..I mean the curvature of the earth&quot;...but funny you use any modern zoom lense and that boat that appeared to disappear over the ball earth&#39;s curvature magically comes right back into frame. It&#39;s all based on humans eyes and their limited ability to see long distances and the horizon&#39;s vanishing point. Just as we can stand on a street with light poles going all the way to affinity and the farther the poles the smaller and smaller they get until they appear to vanish...but I&#39;ll bet you that if you continue walking down that street you&#39;ll find that the poles are indeed the same hight it&#39;s just our eyes perception of them getting smaller. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>there are telescopes that can &#39;see&#39; something the size of a car at over 500kms and so you&#39;re telling me IF I were to put it outside NY harbor I&#39;d be able to &#39;watch&#39; those ships <em>all the way</em> until the telescope could see no further, i.e. 500kms? </p>

<p>You&#39;re saying I&#39;d be able to see Lots of ships with such a scope</p>

<p>Did you know that for a few decades, RADAR couldn&#39;t &quot;see over the horizon&quot; as it travels in a straight line?</p>

<ul>
<li>The super high frequency radio waves used by most radars, called microwaves, travel in straight lines. This generally limits the detection range of radar systems to objects on their horizon (generally referred to as &quot;line of sight&quot; since the aircraft must be at least theoretically visible to a person at the location and elevation of the radar transmitter) due to the curvature of the Earth. For example, a radar mounted on top of a 10 m (33 ft) mast has a range to the horizon of about 13 kilometres (8.1 mi), taking into account atmospheric refraction effects. If the target is above the surface, this range will be increased accordingly, so a target 10 m (33 ft) high can be detected by the same radar at 26 km (16 mi). </li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Siting the antenna on a high mountain can increase the range somewhat; but, in general, it is impractical to build radar systems with line-of-sight ranges beyond a few hundred kilometres</p>

That our school propagates lies to push an agenda? So, because I didn&#39;t learn about true monetary policy and the fact the FED is a privately owned centralized bank in school, does that make it any less true?</p>

<p>To rebut your argument of us bringing back &quot;stuff&quot; back from the moon...
<a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/space/6105902/Moon-rock-given-to-Holland-by-Neil-Armstrong-and-Buzz-Aldrin-is-fake.html">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/space/6105902/Moon-rock-given-to-Holland-by-Neil-Armstrong-and-Buzz-Aldrin-is-fake.html</a></p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying there aren&#39;t reflective mirrors on the moon, but what&#39;s to say man put them there, and not a robot? Soviet Union supposedly sent unmanned robot to leave mirrors there to...doesn&#39;t mean man went to the noon.</p>

<p>Speaking of moon...why haven&#39;t we gone back? Kinda convenient NASA has lost all telemetry data for all the supposed moon landings. Also convenient they&#39;ve supposedly erased over original moon footage. Oh and also the fact the moon never appears to rotate...we always see the same side of the moon.</p>

<p>do I feel the earth rotating 1000s of miles an hr</p>

<p>Do you feel a plane moving at 600mph? Why not? How are you able to stand or piss in the bathroom in a plane moving 600 mph? Ive heard some people even sleep on a plane! Moving that fast... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, so now your turn...speaking of planes...if the earth is rotating a certain way, should a plane going with the rotation of the earth get to its destination a lot faster than if it were to go against the rotation? How can a plan flying at 500 mph go against the rotation of the earth that is going thousands mph and ever get to its destination...and why would they even try? How about a helicopter that hovers in one spot...wouldn&#39;t the earth be rotating under it? But that&#39;s not what we see...a helicopter can hover in one spot for hrs and the earth magically has not moved underneath it has it?</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Its actually slightly faster to fly with the Earth, but remember everything including the air is being pulled downwards to Earth. The North Winds are a result of the coriolis effect and that is why flying with rotation is a little quicker (Not by much though) but the winds are the driving force not the rotation. </p>

<p>Everything is moving at the same speed. This is the reason why when you jump on a plane moving 600mph you dont fly to the back. You the plane and everything in it are all moving the same speed. </p>

<p>Same principle applies to the planet. The planet and everything on it are all moving the same speed. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>a helicopter can hover in one spot for hrs and the earth magically has not moved underneath it has it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again because the helicopter is moving at the same speed as the planet when it takes off. Look back tot he jumping in the aisle of the plane analogy. </p>

<p>Why do you not fly to the back of the plane? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Man...I thought the exact same thing when I first heard about this so called flat earth conspiracy...I was like WTF...now this is going to far! But I also thought the same about 9/11 conspirators back in 2007/2008, but when I actually indulged those crackpot conspirators...you know what, they were right, and I&#39;m so very glad I did, as it has opened my eyes to the true world we live in, and not the world we&#39;ve been told and taught by our ancestors and teachers in school. Like I said, I don&#39;t definitively say it&#39;s not a sphere, but man I&#39;m sure have some legit questions now that I&#39;ve actually looked into it. I never believed the moon landings after I looked into it, but I&#39;m sure as shit did prior to. Too many anomalies, too many convenient mistruths and conflicting accounts, and it just doesn&#39;t line up. Think about it...we went all the way to the moon and back on less technology than we possess now in a smart watch...through the Van Allen Radiation Belts 6 various times without any major incident. No stars in the pics...NO STARS...why, because it was impossible to fake that without someone researching and debunking...so they just left it out!

<p>e.g. I <em>knew as soon as I heard</em> about it on the radio, that 911 was a false flag ... it was Logical (there were NO &#39;wars&#39; for the MIC to sell their products to in 2000-2001 .. check it out, it was <em>obvious</em> to someone like me)</p>

<p>i.e. <em>of course</em> JFK was assasinated</p>

<p>IDK about Apollo getting to the moon BUT I think we&#39;ve been there</p>

<p>That said, I&#39;ve also studied sciences since I was a kid ... all the way through to university, and, I can <em>assure you</em> the earth <strong><em>is not flat</em></strong></p>

<p>But thank you for your reply and thank you for being one of the &#39;younger people&#39; to not just have an &#39;open mind&#39; But are also prepared to use it! </p>

<p>I&#39;m just going to keep asking because it makes you angrier every time. Hahahaha </p>

<p>I mean neither do threads that say 2+2=5 does that mean big math is hiding something from us? Or is it so demonstrably simple to prove that there is no reason to have that discussion?</p>

<p>There are FE threads on conspiracy with thousands of comments, why discredit those?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. Flat earth theory is a disinformation campaign to keep people from looking into &quot;conspiracy theories&quot;. They do this with a lot of shit too. For 9/11, you&#39;ll see people saying that the planes were holograms or that the towers were destroyed by magic alien weapons, and they do this to keep people from considering the fact that the attack was carried out by &quot;allies&quot; to the US. For JFK, they&#39;ll say there were magic bullets and secret additional shooters, and they do this to keep people from considering the fact that Lee Harvey Oswald worked with US intelligence and was likely a patsy just like he claimed before he was assassinated. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t, but I&#39;m beginning  to think that constantly dragging that dead cat here and harping on it when there&#39;s better fish to fry is certainly beginning to look like a conspiracy of it&#39;s own. </p>

<p>And you have the temerity to say you haven&#39;t even bothered to look any of it up! </p>

<p>By and large the vast majority of Flat Earthers thought the idea was utterly preposterous and set out to debunk it thinking it should be a piece of cake. </p>

<p>The more they delved into it the flimsier the arguments and unproven assumptions the globe model depends on actually turned out to be and they continued to find increasingly more evidence that challenged and conflicted with that perspective.</p>

<p>Efforts to actually find and mechanically verify the curvature that should exist and be easy enough to prove over appropriate distances simply wasn&#39;t there. Instead they found that there are perfectly flat and level plains that run for more than a hundred miles without any sign or interruption of what can be seen caused by a curvature that by all rights should be there if the model and dimensions of the globe were correct but quite simply aren&#39;t.</p>

<p>Slowly and steadily they are accumulating precisely those kinds of contradictions and asking for answers that they&#39;re not getting because those who should be able to answer them can&#39;t and are resorting to ridicule and ad hominem attacks instead.</p>

<p>In short, precisely the same kind of attitude that is directed against those of us attempting to investigate any number of other possible conspiracies here because of flaws, anomalies, and inconsistencies in the official narratives we&#39;ve been handed about those.</p>

<p>Now I have no idea who any of the &quot;truth movements&quot; are outside of any ordinary everyday people who happen value knowing the truth for themselves and know that truth doesn&#39;t depend on what any majority of people or consensus of experts happen to think or believe no matter what they happen to call themselves, including a whole lot of attention seeking &quot;truthers&quot; making money off of being ones.</p>

<p>Now the Flat Earthers keep to themselves and have their own forums and don&#39;t bother with the hodge-podge of others that get kicked around here that don&#39;t directly apply to their efforts.</p>

<p>Doubts about the Moon landings, the ISP, and NASA fakery in general, that many of here know isn&#39;t completely on the up and up and seems to be deliberately hiding something from the rest of us are all genuine conspiracies from their perspective, have to be, from their perspective, in fact.</p>

<p>Bottom line they are no different than any of us here and they have taken nothing if not practical and intelligent ways of pursuing whatever the real truth may be in the face of some very hefty odds that not only don&#39;t need any help from us, but would actually be promoting the same kind of attitudes we ourselves have to combat.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Listen, my friend, &quot;I know&quot; what I studied and what I was taught in school and read in my textbooks and from other sources of reference. </p>

<p>Do I &quot;believe&quot; that it was all 100% perfectly true and completely accurate? The answer is &quot;no&quot;, of course not. </p>

<p>A great deal more information exists now that explains many of those things both differently and better and there&#39;s no reason to believe that the new and present information won&#39;t be superseded by something else that may be different and better sometime in the future, too. </p>

<p>Do I &quot;believe&quot; what is different and new now, even if it is better, to be 100% true and completely accurate? No more than what I originally believed what I studied and was taught to be, which is to say I&#39;ve always left that open and subject to change because that&#39;s simply the actual reality and why new textbooks and reference works continually come along to replace old ones.</p>

<p>Does not believing what &quot;I know&quot; from that educational experience and process prevent me from using that information I was given for practical and pragmatic purposes for which it is good enough for what I want or need to accomplish? As matter of fact it doesn&#39;t, even though the explanation I was given for why I&#39;d get those same results has changed from what it was.</p>

<p>That is the nature of what I have tried to explain. &quot;Belief&quot; is an act of faith. A psychological commitment to some particular idea, concept, or theory, <em>as if</em> it was 100% perfectly true and completely accurate which nothing is.</p>

<p>Now it may interest you to know that there isn&#39;t a single scientific experiment that can prove that the Earth is moving or in motion. Not one. Yet there are no less than three, perfectly repeatable ones, performed by respected scientists that demonstrably prove that it isn&#39;t and can&#39;t be moving at all, and although they are a matter of scientific record none of them are taught in any science courses at any level. Do I need to tell you why they aren&#39;t, or do you think you can guess the only logical reason for that?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes well just don&#39;t look too hard at any of those tests or bother your little mind about any other just as possible explanations for them besides the pre-conceived one you already have or who knows what might happen to you if the &quot;shadow of a doubt&quot; ever disturbed your smug certainty about this very uncertain and unusual little world we happen to live in.</p>

<p>And I am not one of &quot;you guys&quot;, as you put it. I&#39;m simply open-minded enough to realize that where there are genuine inconsistencies, anomalies, and contradictions in any official or orthodox narrative that narrative isn&#39;t and can&#39;t be completely true. </p>

<p>How, and in what ways it&#39;s not true, and that can range all the way from a little to being completely false, remains to be seen but one thing is certain and that&#39;s that isn&#39;t and never was worth anyone &quot;believing in&quot; or fighting over and that&#39;s where you and I differ.  </p>

<p>Now I happen to find the experiments the Flat-Earthers are exploring and conducting and the questions that they&#39;re raising to be both interesting and worth paying some attention to, if for no other reason than the fact that the globe model you happen to believe is the only smart, modern, and sophisticated way to look at and interpret what we observe is a 500 year old concept that no one has really bothered to re-consider or re-check in all that time because truth be told they have been just as forbidden to as they were previously forbidden to entertain that idea itself, and you my friend are among the kind of people who want to forbid and deny the existence of any other possibilities besides the one you have been inculcated from childhood to believe in.</p>

<p>Do you not realize that if you didn&#39;t wholeheartedly subscribe to and endorse Newton&#39;s completely materialistic and mechanistic model of the Universe you couldn&#39;t be a scientist and couldn&#39;t get any experimental work that implied that it was wrong, no matter how repeatable it was, published? Or that Newton&#39;s core assumption on which all else was based was that energy was a property of matter and that it took two hundred years to finally accept that matter is only an expression of energy? </p>

<p>Are there newer and better models since that was proven a hundred years ago? Yes there are. Are any of them taught? No they aren&#39;t, Newton&#39;s model is still taught as if it was perfectly true. Why? Because the scientific establishment won&#39;t accept any model that can&#39;t also preserve the Newtonian doctrine that 200 years worth of science is predicated on that would all have to be completely re-thought and re-explained in another and totally different way. </p>

<p>That another and totally different way is Quantum Mechanics that the single greatest impediment to understanding is the materialistic perspective of Newtonian physics that was and still is taught as if it was completely true to such an extent that most people are unable to conceive or grasp anything different.</p>

<p>As far as I&#39;m concerned even if they can prove that the globe model is wrong that doesn&#39;t automatically mean that their idea of a flat one must be true. The same applies to the reverse of that.</p>

<p>Now maybe paying any attention to that undermines your faith in the globe model enough to create an irritating form of cognitive dissonance that compels you to rush to the defence of it and condemn anyone that dares to take issue with it, but it&#39;s a problem I don&#39;t happen to have or share with you.</p>

<p>Whether plane or planet or anything else in between it isn&#39;t going to make the slightest bit of difference to this world or &quot;realm&quot; as Tesla liked to call it or the way we happen to experience it.</p>

<p>Personally I don&#39;t care what anyone else thinks &quot;about it&quot; or what ideas or concepts they can come up with &quot;about it&quot;. The simple fact is that any ideas or concepts we may have &quot;about something&quot; aren&#39;t the same thing as what it actually is.</p>
