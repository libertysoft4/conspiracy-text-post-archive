<p>Take a look at what&#39;s happening around you. Take a look at the cabals he destroyed just during. The campaign. If he&#39;s got you thinking that he&#39;s not that bright, then I would say sun tzu would be very proud of him. He&#39;s got both his enemies and even allies sometimes confused in an informational fog of war, and it&#39;s a great way to operate. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You cannot judge a historical persons moral character by today&#39;s standards. You must do it by the period standards. The first slave owner in America was a black man FYI. Everyone with money across the world, and in money countries still, had slaves back then, it was a way to produce goods for commerce.</p>

<p>You think that iPhone or shoes you&#39;re wearing was made by wel paid workers? No, it&#39;s company store slaves in east Asia. Get over your falsely perceived moral high ground. Go fight slavery in the Congo, or Mexico, or Asia, or the Middle East. It&#39;s rampant. Middle eastern countries are still importing African slaves, castrating them, then selling to homeowners. </p>

<p>We&#39;re one of the first countries in the history of the mankind to abolish slavery on such a mass scale, so save your judgements for some liberal who can tolerate your virtue signaling. </p>

<p>We lost it before. And we can get it back. </p>

<p>But man seriously Russians are crafty bastards. I&#39;m lucky to have come out with my pants on in my dealings with them. Even a simple $5 poker tournament is scary as fuck. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What if trump is working with the Russians to obtain information on Hillary and past crimes? Russia is after all an extraditing partner. What if he is working with Putin to build a global case against George Soros? Putin already wants him dead for manipulating his economy. We know Russia wants to beat us, that&#39;s a given, but what&#39;s not a given is why our own officials want to crush us. We won&#39;t blame Russia, after all they&#39;re our enemy. It&#39;s our own leaders who&#39;ve failed us, and maybe a good way to build a working relationship in decades to come is to work together on i international crime </p>

<p>US/Russia relations are not good. Russia suspects America of preparing a surprise nuclear attack. This is about as grave as it gets. Gorbachev recently said the leaders of both countries should be holding an emergency summit; not meeting on the sidelines of international gatherings!</p>

<p>lol you just now figured this out because there was an altright story on it? That was not a secret at all. It started as opposition research from a fellow Republican and after the RNC and Trump won it went to Clinton. This has been known. lol.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How about Trump and Putin talk about not starting world war 3? That would be smart. That&#39;s not being soft on Russia. That&#39;s having room and authority to negotiate. And do you realise that Crimea had a referendum after the coup in ukraine and decided, democratically of their own accord, to re-join Russia? Do you realise that other ethnically Russian provinces of Ukraine would have followed in a heartbeat, but Putin didn&#39;t accept them, realising the risks were too great?</p>

<p>When the MSM is reporting how the Clinton camp and the DNC funded the dossier, how much clearer can it be? I don&#39;t think WaPo is a great friend of Trump.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reagan had a couple of summits with Gorbachev. It would not hurt for Trump to meet with Putin and discuss their security objectives. Imagine if, in the 80s, the media was screaming about a &quot;bromance&quot; between Reagan and Gorbachev. Imagine if any talk of them meeting to discuss NOT BLOWING UP THE WORLD was met with cries of &quot;Russian collusion!&quot; We may not be here today. </p>

<p>The media is currently in a dangerously infantile state. Only a few commentators such as Paul Craig Roberts can see how dangerous this dumbing down of the discourse is. The superpowers need to be able to communicate, without bedwetting partisan commentators distorting everything. One reason Trump got elected was to normalise relations with Russia. Considering that, anyone pushing the Russiagate lie is basically comitting treason. I would bet that if Trump knew what kind of treatment he was in for from the media, he wouldn&#39;t have run for president. As things are, the pettiness of the media could lead to a major war. Not that Trump isn&#39;t capable of starting one himself- he is. He&#39;s far from perfect. But we don&#39;t need the media goading him into it.</p>
