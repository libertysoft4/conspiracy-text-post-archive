    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s the thing. It actually gets way worse than Weinstein. The sad part is, they will point to news reports in the mainstream media that did technically cover this. What they won&#39;t understand is the media was actually just covering its ass, not the story. One little article here and there will be seen by almost nobody, and the media is fully aware of that. The other option is maybe there are a couple good journalists out there and that&#39;s why it was reported those few times, but I&#39;m a little too jaded to believe that. Make up your own mind. The fact of the matter is there are all kinds of testimonies, court cases, convictions, and news articles on pedos in Hollywood and other industries.</p>

<p>You can find a bunch of links <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/news/comments/76m8pc/vietnamese_child_trafficking_victims_in_uk/dofbzvl/">here.</a> </p>

<p>Spread it where you can. There seems to be a lot of people who aren&#39;t aware of all of this proof that is available. It&#39;s already well documented in the courts and the media, including 60 minutes, LA Times, New York Times, The Independent, Daily Beast, CBS, etc. The only problem is that journalists seem to have really shitty memories, so they never add up all of the proof. They report on a single case once in a blue moon and pretend the problem isn&#39;t really that large, but it is. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>FYI your second link didnt work.  Looks like the web servers firewall is blocking access.</p>

<p>This is some interesting stuff, but is it reasonable to assume that because the entire industry is worth 30 billion that there is some shadiness involved in vaccines?  With the rise of anti-biotic resistant bacteria, and potential epidimics like N1-N1 Ebola i think it&#39;s reasonable that the market value of vaccines as a whole would go up.  Also as 3rd world countries develop the market in which vaccines are available will broaden also giving a higher market share.  I personally don&#39;t think vaccines show any signs of fuckery like say health related things like GMO and fat research do/did.  </p>

<p>I could be wrong though.  Whats your opinion?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know.  I&#39;m grappling with the issue because I&#39;ll be a dad any day.  So I&#39;ve been reading books on both sides and trying to be as objective as I can be.  Drug companies have a long history of shady stuff and I&#39;m inclined not to trust them, especially when some of these vaccines are blockbusters, like Gardasil.  What&#39;s bothered me so far is that, at least in other areas of reddit, you can&#39;t question the pro vaccine crowd without being labeled anti science.  Vaccines DO harm people, but the question is how many and how much.  The pro side says the numbers are so small that they&#39;re insignificant in light of the benefits.  Maybe true.  But I&#39;m still bothered by being labeled a denier for questioning a 30 billion market run by people with a questionable track record and huge profit motive. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can understand being skeptical about people being in the pro vaccine camp and I am sympathetic to your worries about being a new father, but I think you should also be more skeptical of people who are anti vaccination.  See, you can question vaccines as long as your willing to learn and willing to accept what actual experts tell you.  If you&#39;re not willing to learn or accept actual science then don&#39;t be upset when people label you a denier.  I&#39;m not trying to be rude or attack you, but this is just how the cycle goes, and for good reason.</p>

<p>There are a lot of people who want to lie to you on both sides.  But one side doesn&#39;t have any evidence behind their claims.  One side has decades of evidence to back their claims up and the other has feelings and false claims.  </p>

<p>But I&#39;m just a guy who works in IT.  I don&#39;t have a degree to back any of this stuff up, I just repeat what I see online and what little research Ive done.  (Here)[<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0ZZTjChW4o">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0ZZTjChW4o</a>] is a Scientific Journalist on YouTube who has a great series on the media&#39;s failure to report accurately any information and how the media has spread the idea that vaccines can cause autism.  He will do a much better job at explaining what I&#39;m trying to say since I have about as much articulation as a boy talking to his crush for the first time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The preponderance of evidence is certainly with the pro vaccination side.  I don&#39;t particularly care what people label me on reddit.  The idea that may gain a little more traction in a sub like this, though, is that one side in this argument has a massive financial incentive, while the other really doesn&#39;t.  That doesn&#39;t invalidate peer reviewed large group studies, but it does warrant some consideration.  Studies cost money and most of them are done by the side with money.  What about the tobacco, opiate, and oil industry funding research showing their products are safe?  Like what this Scientific American <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/tobacco-and-oil-industries-used-same-researchers-to-sway-public1/">article</a> talks about. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s bullshit logic. You didn&#39;t even read the links. A corporation has no incentive to fund fake studies that &quot;prove&quot; their product works unless they can actually get away with it.

<p>As opposed to just saying everything we know right now is bullshit so the earth is obviously flat. As an example of course. </p>

<p>What if you&#39;re considering something that would make something you thought you &quot;knew&quot;, wrong?  </p>

<p>If you want to truly consider alternative ideas, I think it&#39;s valid to temporarily set aside everything you thought you knew and take the dive, see if it makes sense.  It&#39;s not like by doing so you permanently abandon your prior understanding and can never switch back to it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When someone is presenting you with a new theory or evidence that they say goes against what you &#39;know&#39; then it&#39;s worth considering, or playing the game for a moment, that what you think you know, you don&#39;t actually KNOW. Too many people think they know things when in reality, the only things you KNOW for certain are those things you have directly experienced.</p>

<p>Scientists too often call &#39;knowledge&#39; what is actually consensus, built upon reading one another&#39;s research papers and trusting that what is described in them is an accurate reflection of the research that took place. Really, we know very little and that should mean we are open to all new evidence and all new theories, even ones claiming the earht is flat or that it is run by lizard people. Then you consider the evidence available and make a judgement solely on the basis of the evidence, without allowing your preconceived notions of what is and isn&#39;t possible to influence you. Always challenge your own basic assumptions. Far too many people have basic assumptions that they take to be a given, why they are not based upon their own direct experience. Basic assumption - the sun rises in the East, that one can stand because you witness it with your own eyes every day. The government would never do anything on purpose to harm its people - that&#39;s a basic assumption you have no direct experience of - yes you might not have experienced harm from the govenrment, you might have never seen harm done by the govt reported on the news etc, but you cannot rule it out, or deny the experience of others.</p>

<p>What is your evidence that gravity is what causes things to be &quot;pulled&quot; to the &quot;core&quot; as opposed to falling to the ground because it is more dense than the air.  Same with buoyant things? </p>

<p>As for your balloon example, gravity is working on the balloon. There&#39;s a mixture of helium and air inside the balloon.

<p>Math is a language that can be reverse engineered to fit a preconceived notion.  It can be worked out mathematically by making assumptions but the problem is there is no experiment that can show it is real force.  Henry Cavendish claimed to have done an experiment over 200 years that proved it but nobody can reproduce it.  Here is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3H7Brj5NiE">video of a professional engineer discussing this subject</a> if you are interested.  He explains how it would have been possible to reverse engineer the big G or gravitational constant mathematically.  Brian Mullin is the guys name from the video and he has an entire series called &quot;ball&#39;s out physics&quot; where he questions all of this from a &quot;science educated&quot; point of view.  His youtube has been taken down but many people have mirrored his videos.  </p>

<p>Just because you can work it out mathematically doesn&#39;t mean it is reality.  Notice there is no repeatable experiment that can prove gravity, only formulas on paper.    </p>

<p>Pictures of Earth from space</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are no pictures from space.  NASA provides images and they even admit that they are photosphopped because &quot;they have to be&quot;.  That is coming from Robert Simmon the &#39;Blue Marble&#39; creature.  Images from a known corrupt organization is far from scientific proof.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>pictures of spherical planets in our solar system</p>
</blockquote>

<p>First of all we can only see in 2D, so can not tell if the lights in the sky are spherical or not.  Even if they were spheres what does that prove?  That is like saying that all of the billiard balls are round so the table has to be as well.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>seeing low level clouds dive down into the horizon</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Huh?  Not sure what you are talking about or how that proves curvature.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>spheres have the least surface area for a given volume (most efficient shape)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So why isn&#39;t everything a sphere in nature if it is most efficient?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>when matter coalesces it doesnt form discs but spheres (oil in water shaken up, welding spatter)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not sure what those examples have to do with the earth?  That would just be a random guess that earth is a sphere without any actual evidence.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Where do discs naturally occur in nature?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You brought up disks not me.  Like I said erlier we can only see in 2D so the Sun and moon could be disks just like they could be spheres, we can&#39;t tell.  </p>

<p>So it sounds like the main evidence that you rely on for your spinning ball earth theory are images from NASA, you think the lights in the sky are spheres, and because physicists say so?</p>

<p>Take a step back and see how weak that body of evidence is.  As long as you can admit that you have a belief that the earth is round and spinning that is fine.  Just don&#39;t say there is any variable, repeatable, and measurable evidence that backs that belief up.  </p>

<p>Scientists do suffer from this, they invest their life into a theory and it is difficult to say they have been wrong the whole time. Dont misinterpret the last sentence, we do need people like this because history has proven some of these &quot;nut jobs&quot; were actually right the whole time.  </p>

<p>So are you saying that earth has a tail now?</p>

<p>Yes they are.  But they are created and they pop and disappear. </p>

<p>I have a feeling you&#39;re a suffering from a cognitive bias towards the Earth being flat.</p>

<p>Well I have the same feeling about you and the Earth being a sphere.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I feel like you have invested so much over the past three years you cant question your current beliefs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But the difference is that I believed in a sphere earth for my entire life until 3 years ago when I decided to look for actual evidence instead of just blindly believing what I was told as a child.  You still have the same belief that we all did except you have not yet taken the time to ask for evidence or entertain the idea that you could be wrong.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Just having a conversation, do you still ask yourself if you could be wrong and do you try to disprove your findings to gain more confidence? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sure.  I&#39;m open to a spinning ball earth if someone can provide actual evidence.  I&#39;m not just going to say that it is fact because NASA gives some CGI images though.  If we were really on a 25,000 mile circumference spinning ball someone would be able to show proof of curvature.  After 3 years of searching I have found no proof of curvature or any spinning of the earth.  Saying that objects in the sky are round so we must be living a spinning ball is not science, I&#39;m sorry.  </p>

<p>First I never said it was flat or wasn&#39;t flat.  Second what is the source of that clip?  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Now add in the hundreds of space probes with cameras, does the planet turn towards the probe real quick before snapping a photo?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So out of the hundreds of &quot;space probes&quot; they can not give us one single video of earth spinning for 24 hours?  No video of real time weather going on?  No real pictures of satellites in space?  None of that seems odd to you?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Wouldnt people on earth see that maneuver?</p>

<p>Do you not find it odd that no astronaut (or probe)  has ever done a 360 degree shot in space?  Come on, it is ridicules.    </p>

<blockquote>
<p>1) Government cover up conspiracy, (but now Elon is in on it)</p>

<p>Elon Musk and Space X are an illusion to make people think that they are separate from NASA and the government.  They are just the &quot;private&quot; arm of the same organization.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>2) God exists and we are the center of the Universe</p>

<p>That is what the evidence shows as far as I can tell.  The alternative is that we are an insignificant accident that came from nothing by nothing.  That is way more unbelievable than the fact the we were actually created for a purpose.  </p>

<p>Everyone knew that Weinstein was a sexual predator. People made jokes about it in award shows, TV shows, and more. The reason people didn&#39;t pay too much attention to it was because:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>the only people who could do something about it were Hollywood themselves where Weinstein clearly had a lot of power</p></li>
<li><p>the moment his power waned, he is being thoroughly ostracized and shunted out.</p></li>

<p>To compare, Trump was also known for his sexual deviances for ages. What, with the weird tabloid stories of him calling reporters up to brag about sexual conquests and not to mention those downright creepy Stern interviews and talking about Ivanka and Tiffany.</p>

<p>But when he tried to get into power, instead of disavowing and ostracizing him like how Hollywood has, to Weinstein, a certain segment of the country voted him into the most powerful position on earth.</p>

I said that the primary reason to publicize the Weinstein story should be to expose the systematic and problematic behavior of men in powerful positions and the resulting effect it has on the health and safety of women. I worry however that a lot of the coverage I see has been twisted to serve an agenda that doesn&#39;t benefit women or the sexually harassed in any which way. This post is one of them.

    <div class="md"><p>I mean it&#39;s true. Take a step back and look at what policies the GOP or Trump have enacted. Unless you were part of the 1% or higher, you&#39;re not getting lickety-split out of this.</p>

<p>The stock market is up, great! How much do you have in it? The wealthy have much more of their wealth in stocks, they&#39;ve seen bigger gains than anyone else from the stock market.</p>

<p>The healthcare system is getting fucked to high heaven under Trump. What good does that do you? Are you getting better healthcare now?</p>

<p>Trump&#39;s decimating education and environment funding. Not to mention loosening labor laws if he can get away with it. Or at least that&#39;s the GOP mantra. Are you a big business owner with thousands of employees you can slash and fire away at short notice? If not what do you gain? You&#39;re only losing job security.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not far off. A lot of people talk a lot of nonsense. That doesn&#39;t mean that everything everybody says is nonsense, but it does mean you need some kind of yardstick for judging the reliability of the information you&#39;re given. This tends to come in the form of evidence, in most cases.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What I also am pissed about is people suddenly jumping on the bandwagon the instant MSM covers it, but before, they won&#39;t give it the time of day.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Without some at-least semi-reputable news source presenting the information, the vast majority of people wouldn&#39;t even hear about it. What would you suggest as the alternative?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>*Edit: Why not be as skeptical of the MSM itself? There is a lot of proof out there that the MSM spins false stories, so why suddenly believe a known liar and manipulator of truth?</p>

<p>It&#39;s not mutually exclusive. You can remain skeptical of the MSM whilst not believing every green text post you see on 4chan.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We are kind-of talking about the same thing. I am not defending the out-there conspiracies that don&#39;t have a shred of proof, though it might be hard to figure out which is which.</p>

<p>I kind-of agree with you, but we disagree on the amount that people are willing to listen with an open mind. I say that people should use logic to arrive at conclusions, so even if a credible news source does not report it, we can use our own logic to arrive at conclusions.</p>

<p>An example: A conspiracy theory about the Illuminati and how they control everything in the world. (Not sure if you already believe in this or not). At first glance, sounds really out there, but let&#39;s use our logic.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Do a few people control incredible amounts of power and money? Yes.</p></li>
<li><p>Have Governments lied and manipulated before? Almost every chance they get.</p></li>
<li><p>Does power generally corrupt? Absolutely.</p></li>
<li><p>Can we trust corporations and authority figures to act in the best interests of the general person? Most probably not.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Therefore it is logical to believe in the Illuminati, a select group of individuals that control a lot of power and wealth.</p>

<p>I use logic to try and reason which conspiracies might be true. It pisses me off that most people will not make even this tiny amount of effort.</p>

<p>It&#39;s cute that you&#39;re still in the stage where telling people what they think rather than asking them is what you hold instead of a point of view.  Maybe in 10 years you might be able to grow enough as a human to actually have a conversation with someone instead?</p>

<p>Good luck with that.</p>

She pretty quickly said that it wasn&#39;t Louis, but no one listened to that.

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s the trouble with most taboo information. If it were unequivocally proven next week (it won&#39;t be) that Oswald didn&#39;t hit Kennedy and that there were multiple shooters involved, including one in the storm drain, the response wouldn&#39;t be &quot;OMG, conspiracy theorists were right all along, how could we be so deceived&quot; but rather &quot;OMG, who cares, everybody knew that. I saw it on TV once. Get a life.&quot;</p>

<p>The problem with many conspiracies isn&#39;t so much that nobody knows about them. The problem is that while almost everyone does know about them, we&#39;re all told that it&#39;s only a tiny minority of lunatics and schizos that seriously entertain them. </p>

<p>If everyone suddenly realized that everyone else (except for the very few hopelessly deluded) at least has an inkling that things aren&#39;t great the way they are and that several groups of highly organized, highly powerful individuals actively subvert the public&#39;s will at every turn to keep things this way, then the metaphorical lights would suddenly turn on and leave no place for the snakes to hide anymore. Once we stop thinking that we&#39;re the only ones seeing this shit (even if we may be the only ones who actively look for it), we can attempt to find common denominators of insight with our fellow person and gradually peel away the layers of deception from there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m honestly very curious about what the actual mechanism is. I&#39;ve read studies about how exposure to certain pornography and sex acts leads to constantly chasing greater perversions, because normal sex acts get boring. I wonder if this is just the same effect on overdrive. I mean, if just watching enough pornography can push people into so many varied fetishes, I would assume that having the money and power to pretty much literally date your every desire would eventually lead to needing to constantly &quot;up the ante&quot; in terms of what gets you off.</p>

<p>I doubt that alone could explain it all, but I do wonder if it is a part of it.</p>

<p>No they&#39;re not. They&#39;re using it as a way to show that the attitude of &quot;you have a view about something that&#39;s not in line with the status quo and therefore we believe you have a mental disorder and should be disregarded&quot;.</p>

<p>That&#39;s literally from this thread.  The moon landings post is from the OP.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a classic conspiracist manoeuvre.  Like they try and turn any pedo ring busted anywhere in the world into proof that Pizzagate wasn&#39;t just a fantasy.  Or for that matter retconning pizzagate into pedogate when it became increasingly apparent they had been making fools of themselves.</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s a way to change the conversation. Instead of people having to admit they&#39;re wrong, which everyone hates to do, they can say &quot;everybody knew already&quot;.  Which if you think about it, is a non-admission of them being wrong.  They just abandon the wrong position and adopt the new knowledge as obvious.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes and I read the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/3nq4ll/ashley_judd_reveals_sexual_harassment_by_studio/?st=j944b3jd&amp;amp;sh=7cc2559d">thread in this comment section</a>. The majority of people either want proof or agree with the accusations saying that &quot;Weinstein is sleazy&quot; or that &quot;something tells me it rhymes with Harvey Weinstein.&quot; Is asking for proof defending someone? Because personally I&#39;d like proof for claims. </p>

<p>Yet you supported the claim that people who accused Weinstein of being a sexual predator were being called conspiracy nuts. OP also implies that it was commonplace to be called a conspiracy nut if you accused Weinstein of being a sexual predator since his claim is &quot;If last month you believed Harvey Weinstein was a sexual predator, you were a conspiracy nut.&quot; Now do you have proof for your claim? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Questioning the official story on an event is different, in my mind, than being a ‘conspiracy theorist’. Healthy skepticism is fine, obviously stupid shit like pizzagate is what brings the stigma. </p>

<p>If you label yourself as a conspiracy theorist, and believe in chem trails and fluoride as mind control, I’d say the stigma against you is warranted. </p>

<p>If you think that the official story in any scenario is not the whole truth, then you’re on point. </p>

<p>There’s a lot of crazy and ostensibly dumb shit that gets posted here, and the people that post it and believe it probably do have something wrong with them. </p>

<p>There’s a big difference between not believing anything because “the government/msm/whaever boogieman you want” is controlling the narrative, and reserving judgement because people in power have a stake in the game when it comes to reporting on world events. </p>

<p>On the other hand, if you were to accuse someone of being a sexual predatory before there was evidence of being one, then yes, you probably would be accused of being off your rocker, because you didn&#39;t have evidence.</p>

<p>I still am unclear who Harvey Weinstein actually is.  I couldn&#39;t name a single thing he&#39;s done.  However, it is fairly common trope that Hollywood producers and such are sleazebags.  That&#39;s not surprising.  </p>

<p>I really don&#39;t understand all the hoopla over Weinstein.  Yes, he should be persecuted to the fullest extent of the law.  Yes, he should lose his job.  Others who have done the same that he did should face the same.  But, is it really surprising?  Does it really have to be on the news everyday?  Am I missing something here?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ever hear about &quot;the casting couch&quot;? </p>

<p>Metaphorically, it describes how a young woman desiring to be an actress but possessing no contacts, no friends and very little money of her own, is pressured into sleeping with a well-connected rich director, studio executive or other &quot;Hollywood bigwig&quot; in exchange for a breakout role in a movie, television, radio, theater play or anything that would jumpstart her career to make her rich and famous. </p>

<p>Literally speaking, it&#39;s the couch in the bigwig&#39;s private trailer or room, because the young woman doesn&#39;t rate the formality and expense of a hotel room bed. </p>

<p>As I recall, Alfred Hitchcock made a young actress&#39;s life absolutely miserable when she wouldn&#39;t go along with his advances. </p>

<p>That was 75 years ago. </p>

<p>It&#39;s good that this problem is finally getting addressed in Hollywood, even for a little bit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you believed Harvey Weinstein was a sexual predator a month ago based on, like, his Instagram profile, or some emails he sent about a napkin, then you believe things without adequate proof. This remains true even if a week later the fake news media uncovered that you were right.</p>

<p>That&#39;s like saying, oh, if I said last week that Trump would tweet &quot;I had a very respectful conversation with the widow of Sgt. La David Johnson, and spoke his name from beginning, without hesitation!&quot;, everyone would think I make a prediction based on nothing at all, but there you go, he just tweeted it. I mean, yes, but that doesn&#39;t mean people would be wrong thinking I can&#39;t predict Trump tweets.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can say though, in the last year or so, a lot more of my friends that I never thought believed in &quot;conspiracy theories&quot; have been much more open about them.  Especially since the Vegas shooting.  People I&#39;ve never heard say a word about conspiracies, start talking about vegas and somehow end up on building 7.  Its an interesting turn of events recently.  I feel like a lot of people are either opening their eyes and ears, or conspiracies have been getting more exposure so people feel more comfortable speaking openly about it.  Hopefully this sticks and open conversation motivates people to begin to pay closer attention.  </p>

<p>The stock market is up, great! How much do you have in it? The wealthy have much more of their wealth in stocks, they&#39;ve seen bigger gains than anyone else from the stock market.</p>

<p>The healthcare system is getting fucked to high heaven under Trump. What good does that do you? Are you getting better healthcare now?</p>

<p>Trump&#39;s decimating education and environment funding. Not to mention loosening labor laws if he can get away with it. Or at least that&#39;s the GOP mantra. Are you a big business owner with thousands of employees you can slash and fire away at short notice? If not what do you gain? You&#39;re only losing job security.</p>
