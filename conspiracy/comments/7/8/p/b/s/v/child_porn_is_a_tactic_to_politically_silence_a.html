        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I believe that the influx of pedophilia is an indicator the deep state is silencing many people that can expose the real corruption, unrelated to pedophilia. Pedophilia is merely a tool to silence someone by assassinating their character. I also believe that different tactics are used depending on the individual. Many investigators gets the two bullet suicide such as Gary Webb and Vince Foster. We have Michael Hastings and Daphne Caruana Galizia who are journalists that got car bombed. Perhaps, insiders gets sexual assault/rape or pedophilia accusations, and outsiders gets the two bullet suicide or car bomb.</p>

Of course it can be planted on people&#39;s computer but child abusers are a lot more common and networked than people realize as you can see with Epstein, hastert, wiener, Catholic Church leadership, and foreign dignitaries it seems to be a taste cultivated amongst the global elites. To assume it is false is a disservice to the victims who are already intimidated and terrified to break their silence. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Too bad the sentencing for child abuse, exploitation, or molestation of a child on a first offense is very light.  Maximum sentencing  is around 3.5 years.

<p>The system doesn&#39;t think child abuse is that big of a deal, but if you are choosing to ingest drugs on your own accord you better be careful. They will bring the hammer down and make sure you feel shame. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Paddock was charged Tuesday in a 20-count felony complaint for an arrest warrant.  He was charged with one count of possession of more than 600 images of child pornography, and 19 counts of sexual exploitation of a child, for crimes that allegedly occurred between Jan. 1 an Aug. 30, 2014.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The system at the top is completely compromised judges, politicians, chiefs of police, military officers, too much to list are complicit and are themselves child abusers. I have a very liberal friend and she says she will vote for the most conservative republican if they would simply put children&#39;s protection on their platform. She is baffled that none of them talk about it. She has noticed how many pedo arrests have happened since trump is in charge and is not as anti trump as she used to be. Hopefully trump will leverage his record on child abusers because it will draw wide support across both aisles. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It truly is horrible, how the system got so corrupted. It&#39;s been like this well before I was born. But now is not the time for hope, it is a time for action. Trump campaigned on action. I didn&#39;t vote for Trump but I&#39;m glad he won. He isn&#39;t hoping America will be great again. His actions are a step in the right direction. Now it is our actions as citizens that will matter most. The light is shining bright on those who wish to hid in the shadows. It is time for the people to expose the criminals in our local government bodies. Put pressure on all fronts. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I will be posting some research that is the follow up to a post I did about a month ago about the purity movement, and how they literally changed the course of history regarding children&#39;s rights. The actions they took can be replicated today on an even greater scale because of technology. We can all contribute in our own individual way, even artists are important for a movement, media, legal experts, all we need are passionate people who believe in the cause. 
I am putting an organization together to lobby for a constitutional amendment to make children a protected class, just as we do for minorities, women, and disabled. I am a bit overwhelmed in truth, I travel a lot and have a lot of family obligations, but I cannot give up. None of us can children are too vulnerable to put them in the hands of these corrupt psychopaths!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was a BBC show that highlighted blackmail, and shadow govt, corrosion to torture and other things. Too real and got kicked off air maybe. I found it from a subreddit talking about the HBO show true detective and how that was also based on real events, as horrific and creepy as it was. True detective has crazy deep South Louisiana Santeria couple w child open. It was an incredibly well done show too. Eerie. It is even creepier considering all the pizzagate and Hollywood pedo info breaking headlines in a tidal wave currently.sooooo anyway both amazing shows. Utopia was BBC and I watched it on kodi. Also watch the wire.</p>

<p>Everyone wave to the pedo-enabler sub!!!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Everyone wave to u/RecoveringGrace, the pedophile protector who lies about being an abuse victim to deter criticism as they push false allegations of pedophilia against people who criticise their God Emperor.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think that was from u/Dronevape???</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand your viewpoint but at the same time,  pedophilia is becoming deeply ingrained in our society on all levels. There are darknet sites dedicated to amassing terabytes of cp, making accessible to anyone, there are criminal organizations pimping out children to any joe schmoe who has a few hundred bucks in his pocket. You have teachers, coaches, and beat cops abusing children as well. Even the scummiest addicts on the bottom of society are still prone to sexually abuse minors.</p>

<p>Hell even in ancient greece it was common for older men to have a young boy companion for sexual gratification. It is simply not logical that child pornography exists solely to discredit people. Especially since pedos normally hold positions of power in our society and 90% of people don&#39;t seem to bat an eyelash</p>

<p>If anything the reason, I think, pedophilia seems to becoming more mainstream is as a result of our instant gratification society. We live in a society where we expect every pleasure to be at our fingertips. There is always another forbidden fruit to sink your teeth into,  pedophilia is just another kink these days, and it is a kink that just happens to be shared by the global elite.</p>

<p>I had an absurd thought the other day with all this hollywood pedo talk hitting the front page recently. What if sexually abusing kids was like what golf, or cocaine used to be to the business world? A hobby you can share with others on your level, that lets you bond, build report, and of course have fun with others in your caste?</p>

<p>I really hope that isn&#39;t the case, but I can only wonder as an outsider looking in.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe that the influx of pedophilia is an indicator the deep state is silencing many people that can expose the real corruption, unrelated to pedophilia. Pedophilia is merely a tool to silence someone by assassinating their character. I also believe that different tactic are used depending on individual. Many investigators gets the two bullet suicide such as Gary Webb and Vince Foster.</p>
