        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Trump is holding a televised press conference tonight to declare a national state of emergency on the opiod crisis in America. Jeff Sessions has already promised stricter drug laws and even went as far as comparing marijuana usage to opiate usage.</p>

<p>It&#39;s no secret the private prison industry has cozied up to Trump, both of them have plenty of money to exchange if prisons are profiting. An example from today&#39;s headlines:
<a href="http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/357282-private-prison-company-moves-annual-conference-to-trump-golf-course">http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/357282-private-prison-company-moves-annual-conference-to-trump-golf-course</a></p>

<p>So basically, it looks like War on Drugs 2.0 may be starting up--with stricter drug laws, sentencing, and more nonviolent people going to prison for trying to medicate through their shitty lives.</p>

<p>Thoughts?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, but it can&#39;t hurt to hold onto a thread of hope. Unfortunately, my cynicism doesn&#39;t allow me to profess my undying love and support of Trump (he&#39;s fucked up quite a lot), but he has also done a lot of good since he&#39;s been in office. At this point, I feel like the obvious result of this is the continuation and escalation of current DEA tactics, but if Trump really wanted to send a fuck you to the establishment he&#39;d start with big Pharma.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Now I&#39;ve heard the theory that the government allows more drugs into the public in times of dissent--like LSD during the Vietnam protests. Then the government can villainize drug users and create criminal and public backlash against protestors/drug users. </p>

And then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities,&quot; Ehrlichman said. &quot;We could arrest their leaders. raid their homes, break up their meetings, and vilify them night after night on the evening news. Did we know we were lying about the drugs? Of course we did.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are actually thousands of deaths connected to the abuse of prescription opioids, while there are none that could ever be attributed to Cannabis consumption. While I don&#39;t think that prosecution of users is in any way helpful, I do think it&#39;s an issue that ought to be addressed federally. Rescheduling cannabis into a class that actually is scientifically justifiable (which would automatically decriminalise it), as well as prescribing things under medical guidance that demonstrably help to cure opioid addiction (like Kratom, weed too to some degree, or certain psychedelics like psilocybin or MDMA) would go a tremendous way into solving the problem.</p>

<p>Of course, I have a hard time imagining that this could happen anytime soon, as it would make US presence in Afghanistan and other places largely obsolete (no more poppy farm production), and it would undercut the majority of the black budget. That&#39;s not even mentioning the hissy-fit the pharma lobby would throw if any of the steps above were to be taken.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its already started.... from 2016 they sent warnings to doctors to cut back on giving opiates or benzos to stop overprescription. Pharmacies are now linked too and let doctors know when patients get same drugs from multiple doctors. They will prob start giving harsher penalties or more strict limits now.</p>

<p>People will def flip out, we will see a lot more cranky people with endless complaints. We need it tho... its why I always thought &quot;legalize everything&quot; was a silly idea, addiction is an easy trap to fall into. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Prediction: The new &quot;war on drugs&quot; will be to target legitimate opiod use in favor of reduced prescriptions.  This will force those who legitimately use opiates for pain to seek the drugs in illegal markets and drive up the price and demand of illegal opiates.  Existing opiate substitutes like kratom will also be targeted to funnel people into illegal opiate use.</p>

<p>In short, its a power/money grab for those controlling the illegal drug market.</p>

<p>if they wanted to reduce crime they&#39;d cut the cost into a third of its price now.</p>

<p>price goes up and supply isn&#39;t totally eliminated -- and your going to have more muggings, robbings, break ins and other crimes than ever.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><em>”The Nixon campaign in 1968, and the Nixon White House after that, had two enemies: the antiwar left and black people. You understand what I’m saying? We knew we couldn’t make it illegal to be either against the war or black, but by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin, and then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities. We could arrest their leaders, raid their homes, break up their meetings, and vilify them night after night on the evening news. Did we know we were lying about the drugs? Of course we did.”</em></p>

<p>-John Ehrlichman
Advisor to President Nixon </p>

<p>Same old shit, different day. A desperate, greedy politician throwing the most vulnerable Americans under the bus in an unscrupulous attempt at maintaining power. Hopefully this time the people are more aware to Bone-spur-bozo’s bag of Nixon tricks.</p>

<p>I can be accused of copying up with rapists if I happen to sit beside them in the subway.</p>

<p>Does merely meeting with Trump imply some sort of support is going the other way?  What was discussed?  </p>

<p>Also, there is no such thing as private prisons in the country.  Every so called private prison is actually 100% funded by taxes, is 100% regulated by the state, they have nominally private owners who must pay and obey.</p>
