    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m agreeing with the comment saying they need to post some ID show which city they live in so we can cross reference that with the people that died and the city they lived in. It&#39;s like every time I post or see a comment about this there somebody that pops up saying that they knew somebody personally that was shot and killed. Its just a unusual amount of people saying they were directly connected with someone that was there that got killed. Not saying that everybody is lying-just saying that it&#39;s kind of unusual.and of course nobody proves that they were actually connected with anyone that that was shot.<br/>
It&#39;s like you&#39;re out of line if you ask someone to actually prove that they know the person that was shot or killed. So we left to wonder if they&#39;re telling the truth and people keep on asking instead of just proving it and being done with it they take their high horse and say we&#39;re out of line for asking.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What incentive does that person have to post personal information though?<br/>
It would be more unusual if a lot of people claimed to know victims in Sandy Hook - children with no online presence in an isolated town.  Over half of the victims killed in Las Vegas were from California.  That covers a lot of densely populated cities increasing the chance they were known personally by someone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because this sub is troll heaven. So if you say your brother got shot then we should just believe that right? Because of. the sympathy angle. People offer up that info as proof to it being a false flag or hoax right? Yet when your asked to prove what your stating - you ain&#39;t having none of that. The proof is your word right?

<p>As far as what you&#39;re representing. This sub has been bombarded by new accounts sharing information. Great. So long as they provide proof to what their claims are. If this shooting was a hoax or false flag, damage control after the fact would certainly be accounted for.

<p>It isn&#39;t that odd that all of a sudden people who knew someone who was there or died post here and says so. Welcome to the world wide web. Almost no one buys the official story. Stands to reason they would end up here looking for ideas. The theory of six degrees of separation was established before the internet. I think it would be closer now. I don&#39;t know any of the dead or injured. But I don&#39;t know people who have encountered those people due to their jobs. Don&#39;t be so quick to dismiss people or find it so odd that people attached to the event ended up here. It really isn&#39;t that far fetched. They use reddit too.</p>

<p>Excuse my disdain for a file type easily associated with viruses. What&#39;s your beef with imgur? It removes all exif data that your phone takes, that could identify your current location down to the address..</p>

<p>It isn&#39;t that odd that all of a sudden people who knew someone who was there or died post here and says so. Welcome to the world wide web. Almost no one buys the official story. Stands to reason they would end up here looking for ideas. The theory of six degrees of separation was established before the internet. I think it would be closer now. I don&#39;t know any of the dead or injured. But I don&#39;t know people who have encountered those people due to their jobs. Don&#39;t be so quick to dismiss people or find it so odd that people attached to the event ended up here. It really isn&#39;t that far fetched. They use reddit too.</p>
