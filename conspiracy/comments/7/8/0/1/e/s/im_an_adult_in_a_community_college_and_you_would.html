I&#39;m forced to do group work with them and it&#39;s unbelievable.  As a result, all the classes are taught at a middle school level.  My teacher accused me of copying out of the book because my grammar was correct.  One of our Earth Science &quot;experiments&quot; was holding dry soil in a cup, then adding water, and writing down which was heavier.  Seriously.  I knew going in the teachers are liberal - but every teacher automatically assumes the kids are on board with their far left beliefs.  And they are!  I don&#39;t know what politics has to do with Science, but my Earth Science teacher said on the first day &quot;I&#39;m a lefty (to applause) and you&#39;re going to see the issues that matter to ME&quot;.  What an EGO!  Who the hell cares!  That&#39;s how important agenda - in any setting - is to them!  I would never have the gall to batter my political beliefs into anyone - let alone a whole class.  Geez.  This has to be the result of the Dewey &quot;create a better citizen&quot; or dead-head automoton who obeys, doesn&#39;t question and worships authority.  It&#39;s a shame.  What will these kids do for work?</p>

<p>In my Descriptive Astronomy class, the instructor is using a <a href="http://media.scientificsonline.com/images/originals/3053594_1.jpg">Celestial Sphere Globe</a> for day&#39;s lesson, and class being a pseudo-open forum, a young lady raises her hand: </p>

<p>&quot;That&#39;s not how big the sun is, right?&quot;</p>

<p>Our instructor responds with a look that could only say, &quot;(You fuckin&#39; with me? You&#39;re not fucking with me.)&quot;</p>

<p>Followed by a sober, &quot;No. This is a diagram. <em>This</em> sun is meant to depict its celestial movement. Were it to scale, the sun could not fit in this room, let alone this plastic ball.&quot;</p>

<p>Looking around, no one shared my disbelief. I surmised collective courtesy and followed suit. Not the case. I shit you not, and i wish i was making this up, <em>in the same class</em> another student asked, &quot;What do you mean when you say &quot;Northern Hemisphere? <strong>Is there a Southern Hemisphere?&quot;</strong></p>

<p>God.Dammit.</p>

<p>If anything the first sentence is quick, to the point, and is coherent enough to make sense out of. Unlike that latter example of incoherent word vomit and buzzwords. Like comparing the fundamental basic scientific practice of weighing and measuring to politics in the same breath. </p>

He is claiming that they took two identical cups of dirt and poured water into one, and then <em>qualitatively</em> determined which was heavier. It is insulting to the hard sciences that you would conflate this with genuine scientific process. If his account is accurate, then he would be absolutely correct to denigrate his teacher for running an experiment that couldn&#39;t hope to challenge the intuition of a toddler. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you being deliberately obtuse? Those were two distinct ideas. Context makes it clear that you can read a paragraph break after the &quot;Seriously&quot; fragment. The next sentence was a lead-in to the allegation that a science instructor was politicizing a science class. In fact, you cut off his quote mid-sentence! That&#39;s extremely dishonest, and the full quote is perfectly clear!  </p>

<p>I&#39;m going to give you the benefit of the doubt and assume that you have a severe reading comprehension problem rather. The alternative would be shameful. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Think about how this would change the workforce- you could retire by 40 without having to do shady shit to retire early. Live another forty years cultivating civics &amp; reinvesting into society while enjoying the prime of your life. 
Instead it&#39;s industrialized education and healthcare &amp; then your crippled body eventually gives out. 
As the altLeft attempts their media campaign to give voting rights to transhuman fox-kin 14 year olds, you won&#39;t hear anything about remodeling education in anyway that would free them of edu debt or giving them credit for the classes they take. 
Every time I talk to a teacher or administrator about my going to school for education they either tell me to not bother or advise me on how to best scam my way to the $$ ( I&#39;m looking at you admins- Masters degree in being fucking assholes. ). </p>

Combine that with being able to be on parents&#39; insurance until 26 and now you&#39;ve got a whole host of kids going to school not because they want to, but because they have little choice. What would you do? Stay at home and go to school and have health insurance? Or be out in the world, on your own at 17, 18, 19 with no insurance, no job, no &quot;education&quot;? </p>

<p>The real conspiracy is that high schools don&#39;t teach life skills or how to manage money, bills, etc. I graduated HS 12 years ago and even back then it was basically, &#39;you have to go to college, OR YOU&#39;LL DIE&#39;. There were no alternatives given to students, and it&#39;s not like critical thinking is taught in school anymore, so most people just went with what they were told. It&#39;s saddening...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the real conspiracy is based on weeding out classes, and inequal access to good education and help where people need it to succeed.</p>

<p>I think they want to keep the institution of classism rolling by selecting out rebellious thinkers who would challenge both sides of the system through means of over-credentialism.</p>

<p>making sure that specific types of people cannot pass through unrelated courses that are still considered pre-requirements officially.</p>

<p>there is no way to fix it without massive expenditure, and the lowering of wages across higher end fields (because of the influx of highly skilled workers that would come of it)</p>

<p>I&#39;m saying, pay the math professors significantly more than non-math professors. offer special extra tutoring and longer class times/more days of class per week in those classes for a higher cost, and re-examine each major and determine whether or not some prereqs are actually required or not.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I noticed the same thing.  Some of these community colleges have graduation rates of 20-30%.  Everyone is so conditioned to believe that college is the next step after high school.  Another possible explanation is this is the first time many of these kids have this kind of freedom; no one is forcing you to go to class and do homework anymore.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wouldn&#39;t say its because their test scores were low is the only reason they didn&#39;t go to a university. I have a CC in my hometown and chose to go to it because it was 3000 for two years of school that basically got to go for free because of scholarships. Also, my parents died so why would I throw myself right into debt if I could go to CC and get a 2 year degree for free? I know what you mean, that CC is still for kids who didnt get into bigger schools, but its not only that. Why not get a free college degree?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Unfortunately, it&#39;s not so much a racket as that half of the country needs those courses.  They should let you test out, but the problem is mostly that college is now expected of students vs. an actual achievement as it was in the past. Note, I&#39;m in the camp that thinks college is great, but only if you&#39;re really aspiring to something that needs it. An associates, trade, etc. are equally good options. It all depends on what you need (and many who end up there dont need college). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I teach college algebra at a major state university. 99% of students who wish to earn a B.S. degree have to take College Algebra and trigonometry. The school doesn&#39;t give two shits if you took them at a community college, have high math subject SAT scores, or have AP calculus credit. Students can get credit for one or the other but not both. </p>

<p>This puts engineering students in an awkward position because they can&#39;t immediately start taking their calculus and physics sequences. The school&#39;s solution? Let them take college algebra and trig and the same time. The workload is huge - too large for a class that meets once a week for an hour. As a result, there are people who are more than capable of the math but have to change major because they don&#39;t perform.</p>

<p>I have no idea what the logic is supposed to be behind this. Money, I guess. As soon as I finish my graduate work, I&#39;m out of academia for good. Can&#39;t wait. </p>

You took two years of foreign language, two years of mythology, and then basically covered all the Literature concepts you covered in high school. This school had a big sticker price too.</p>

<p>Every single day, from the first to the last, we read 30 books and turned in 10 pages of handwritten analysis.  Handwriting, grammar, and comprehension were all equal parts of the game.</p>

<p>Junior level classes at Uni were a breeze.  Very few of my class even went to college, but all have done remarkably well in life.</p>

<p>She worked with kids that were promoted to Senior that had an 8th grade reading level.  She didn&#39;t fail anyone early on, but her method got everyone into shape.  Within 8 weeks or less.</p>

<p>She just passed.  She wasn&#39;t my favorite teacher ( I had her class late in the day, so my 10 pages were always on my time) but my friends that had her 1st and second worked on those 10 pages every second of every day they could.</p>

And the school is competitive for their money, trying to have sports teams and satellite programs from private colleges. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I applied at an architecture university back in the day. They literally told me I wasn&#39;t ready because I went to a public school. My public school education was a joke as far as college prep courses too. If you wanted to be an architect the closest they had was one year of drafting 101. And in that class we made cheap homes out of Styrofoam for a whole semester. The other semester we did drafts of nuts and bolts. I could of been learning that in 5th grade.</p>

<p>Public school... history is a joke. When later in life you realize those events sometimes didn&#39;t happen like we were taught, or it was flat out propaganda. I Learned enough math to calculate the trajectory of a football. And enough science to believe in an atom, even though the atom is somewhat theoretical, still.  Just a few of the pointless endeavours of my public education.  In hindsight I&#39;m glad I only spent a few years in college. I make more money being a professional landscaper than many of the available menial jobs a public education can offer. But it&#39;s not until you are a senior in public school when all of sudden it&#39;s time to pick a carreer or plan on being in debt the rest of your life paying off college loans.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. May just be your experience. In high school I scored high enough on certain exams that when I went to college I was exempt from taking some classes. For example, I didn’t need to take the first two years of a foreign language, because of my high school scores. I was able to pick classes that were new to me.  </p>

<p>I think it all depends on the college and I don’t necessarily think public/private schools make a difference. For my undergraduate degree I went to a public university and for my graduate degree I went to a private university. I preferred the public school. </p>

<p>Not sure how your college is but at mine you can select any course from the given gen ed categories. There were bullshit courses in those categories however you can there were also challenging courses in those same categories.</p>

<p>Its just that science majors are not allowed to take any science gen ed course except Chem and Bio. There are however bullshit courses in that category.</p>

And even my freshman year I took plenty of business/accounting classes. And obviously the wealthy have better education, that&#39;s what comes with capitalism and a society strictly based off wealth. And I know plenty of people who started off at cc who went on to really fucking good schools, so it seems like the public education in op&#39;s district is trash.

<p>And it starts with education. At a young age, the Elite are taught creativity, critical thinking, the actual history of the world and the connections that events have, and most importantly are given the tools and education that will enhance their ability to subjugate.</p>

<p>The masses are given an education that ensured they will be obedient laborers. There is a constant and unending assault on public education that has served to erode its quality for decades.</p>

<p>These achievements, of course, are examples of their enslavement.

Fact of the matter is, the degrees that get you there are a handful and then from there those that make it are a smaller handful.</p>

<p>Believe it or not, people do have very diverse life goals. I personally would not want to work in those types of industries and none of my studies or specializations will lead me there.</p>

<p>That is the choice I made, along with many others. There are people out there who really do achieve some amazing things. Not in the realm of business or marketing mind you.</p>

<p>I went to school to study a passion, and academia is what I have excelled at through and through. Analysis, reading, philosophy, writing. I could have done a business degree easily too. I was very studious out of high school, I had decent math scores, and I could have hunkered down and did it. But fuck that, it&#39;s not what I want out of life.</p>

<p>So point is, don&#39;t assume that everyone goes to school for that purpose. Why are you going? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nothing is wrong with independent thinking. Science encourages it.</p>

<p>If you propose unicorns are living on the moon, when all known research and literature known to man clearly shows that unicorns do not exist and the moon cannot sustain life as we known it, then you&#39;d better provide some very solid evidence to back up your claims. Even then, you&#39;d better start a deep literature review because there is surely research somewhere that supports at least some part of the proposal made to help validate the claim. If one proposes an idea without any foundation to support it (especially when it attempts to go against all known independently verified knowledge), AKA citations, then it lacks any evidence of verifiable logic, it is fundamentally weak, and can be quite easily disregarded.</p>

<p>The real college experience, you take a college placement test, to determine what classes you need to take. I didn&#39;t do college until about 10 years after high school, and I placed at honors level for everything but math.</p>

<p>The concept is that you continue on where you left off, unless you place at a higher level. Community colleges tend to have more older folks that haven&#39;t been in school for years, so if you placed at lower than college level, they&#39;re going to be comprehensively going over the basics.</p>

<p>Until you reach year 3+, they&#39;re not going to assume everyone knows about x.. something like doing MLA or APA citations. Higher level courses aren&#39;t going to focus on it, but they&#39;re still going to go over it.</p>

<p>I had a pretty amazing experience with my community college, and honestly the University was sub par in a lot of ways in comparison.</p>

<p>The OP reads like how someone &quot;imagines&quot; college to be, and absolutely reeks of the exact kind of posts I&#39;ve seen in r/the_Donald countless times.</p>

<p>The very fact they tried to inject political views into it, falsely, screams this person is full of shit. I&#39;ll bet they don&#39;t even live in the US.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All depends on the CC I suppose. I got my associates degree at Wake Tech in the Raleigh, NC area. They are a very respected CC in the state. They have over 70k students and multiple campuses. A couple of my teachers talked any sort of politics. My political science teacher (thankfully), my history teacher, and my American Literature teacher. </p>

<p>Thankfully my political science teacher completely shielded his political beliefs from us. I still don&#39;t know his beliefs but I can only guess because I played against his church in a softball league. My history teacher was an admitted &quot;lefty&quot; and was a black female. Thankfully she was completely fair when it came to grading. You could make a &quot;right wing&quot; argument and if it was supported, rational, and well written she would give it a good grade. My English lit teacher was a bit wacky and talked politics a bit. He also played the Didgeridoo for a few minutes during class so I think he was just a bit off (I think you either have to be a bit off or dry as dust to be an American Lit teacher but that is just me).</p>

<p>The students were all over the spectrum. There was everything from purple hair lesbian feminists to 30 year old Alpha male vets. Most of the students were pretty average. Most were decent students. They weren&#39;t brainiacs but that is obviously rare. Most were just young people working their way through college. Obviously there were stupid students like the ones who&#39;d walk in 30 minutes into a 50 minute class all the time and the idiot who got a tattoo of a heart on his ass because he was drunk one night but there are idiots everywhere.</p>

<p>My CC experience was great and I still encourage people to go there instead of a 4 year college if they don&#39;t know what they want to do.</p>

<p>I agree. In fact, I find that most of the kids are far beyond the material being taught in the courses. The courses are of course full to the brim with bad technique and junk material. Are there any actual experts out there that think memorizing trivia and short answer tests are an effective standard for designing an education system?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s community college for you. It&#39;s all the kids that didn&#39;t do well enough to go off to college. Now, I don&#39;t mean gradewise. I mean they couldn&#39;t get their shit together enough to apply for and follow through with college recs. </p>

<p>I went to a state school and kids there were fine. They excelled. Then I went to a private graduate school, same deal. Kids at all levels excelled. </p>

<p>But I had to do one undergraduate credit that I was required for my grad degree that I never took undergrad. So I took it cheap at community college, and it&#39;s exactly what you said. </p>

<p>Lazy kids who can&#39;t even handle the basics of a class. One kid missed so many classes that the professor told him he couldn&#39;t take the final. He showed up the last day to take the final and the prof got us started and then talked to him in the hallway about responsibility and maturity and suffering the consequences of your actions. He was loud enough that a silent room of test takers could hear every word. </p>

<p>Community college is the cheapest lowest rung of undergraduate education, that&#39;s what you&#39;re going to deal with. Check up the chain a little higher and you&#39;ll find the rest of the kids who are motivated and not lazy. </p>

I’ve taught classes of kids that aren’t academically right on track. And you’re right, it’s terrifying. A large part of this is the emphasis on test scores. If it isn’t on the test, core teachers just don’t have time to teach it anymore if they want to keep their jobs. Furthermore, helicopter parenting and fear of lawsuits have ensured that the fastest way to get what you want out of any situation is to have your parents come to school and scream at the principal. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nobody is running classes trying to do that, they&#39;re trying to just insert a little bit of knowledge into kids&#39; brains in the hopes that it will help them do something with their lives. In community college, you see some adults trying to get a fresh start, some kids trying to save money and figure out what to do, and some kids that are close to just falling out of the system and being cashiers for the rest of their lives. You have to build classes that work for all three groups.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I too think It&#39;s interesting that you read what I wrote as an insult. I even made sure to dial it back so I didn&#39;t seem as if I was insulting. </p>

<p>All I can think of is that I said I felt sorry for you if you did attend a Univ and you still have those thoughts. Either way, I do apologize if it was condescending. Not my intention.</p>

<p>Based on my experience, I can only think of a few classes of the almost 200 credit hours I have taken so far that were complete bantam fodder bullshit ya know. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying bullshit filler classes don&#39;t exist and that there isn&#39;t a lot of bullshit that goes on a Univ. </p>

<p>For example my Univ has a deal with Pearson to use all their books and shit. I hate that and that is bullshit capitalism at its finest. Sometime there materials suck ass. </p>

<p>But to imply that most university classes are there to enslave the masses or whatever it was you said? I mean that just screams &quot;I have an opinion on Universities, but I&#39;ve never actually attended one&quot; which I could totally be wrong about. </p>

<p>This is me drawing my own conclusions. </p>

<p>Since it appears that it will improve my credibility, the fact is that I am <em>currently</em> attending a university and am also disappointed with my experiences. Which is why Op&#39;s thread speaks to me, and I have an opinion specifically <em>because</em> of my relation with the topic. It is obvious that our two interpretations of reality are different, but I think it&#39;s a shame that apparently my interpretation is so alien to you that you can&#39;t even entertain the idea that a credible person could hold these opinions. That indicates a closed mind, and a lack of creative thinking, which ironically is one of the critiques that I have of the American education system as a whole that I have brought up in this thread.</p>

<p>Of course, let me assure you that I am <em>not</em> the first person to come up with this idea. There are many far more intelligent, experienced people who have been expressing this idea for decades. The evidence is there. I&#39;ve just recently watched the 5 hour long interview with John Taylor Gatto, who as a man with credibility, might be interesting to you -- assuming you&#39;re comfortable with your world view being challenged.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude your whole point was that these classes are bullshit and you question why do they even exist but to subjugate the masses to a lifetime of slave wages. It&#39;s not some mythical viewpoint that you have to be open minded to understand... </p>

<p>Just because I&#39;m calling you out on your broad generalization on college courses does not mean I am close minded or lack creative thought.</p>

<p>Personally, I already know the value of being a well rounded college educated working individual. I have a bachelors degree, my wife has a bachelors degree. I&#39;m working on a 2nd bachelors degree because shockingly, I wanted to do it for fun. We both already make good money directly because of those degrees we&#39;ve earned. Sure maybe we could&#39;ve been successful without college, but it would&#39;ve taken years of additional hard work and a lot of luck for either of us to get the jobs we have now at prbly a lower pay rate.</p>

<p>Now I completely understand if college just isn&#39;t for you that&#39;s 100% okay and you can be super successful without it... But to imply that it&#39;s all bullshit and is a waste is so ridiculous. Plenty of people have the exact opposite experience as you. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Aight well I&#39;ll keep going. </p>

<p>I think your &quot;idea&quot; that going to a university is &quot;bullshit&quot; and a way to &quot;subjugate the masses to a life of slave wages&quot; is inaccurate because just like myself and many others, I couldn&#39;t be doing what I do today without my degree. </p>

<p>My wife couldn&#39;t either. My best friend wouldn&#39;t work at NASA without it. Etc. </p>

<p>You don&#39;t necessarily need to have a degree to be successful but to say that it&#39;s &quot;bullshit&quot; and a way to &quot;subjugate the masses to slave wages&quot; is certainly misguided. </p>

<p>Anyone with or without a college degree is a slave to their wages. It&#39;s just about finding a job that you like to do. And for some people, having a degree is a requirement to get that job. </p>

<p>Like I said before you can be successful either way, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s dumb not to go to college. But it has many benefits and is certainly not bullshit entirely. Just some parts. </p>

<p>At the least, with the way Western society is designed, the definition of &#39;success&#39; is exceptional adherence to the wage slave model: sink decades of energy into the <del>indoctrination</del> education system, accrue a mountain of debt through student/home/auto loans, slave away in your cubicle out of fear of &quot;getting dirty,&quot; obey authority unquestionably, swallow your pills that make this sick life tolerable, and exchange your human energy for useless trinkets. (This is the lifestyle that Alex Jones calls &#39;spiritual vampirism.&#39; While an accurate account, the absurdity of the label he attaches to it makes it easy for those &#39;vampires&#39; to mock and discredit the idea, which makes sense because Alex Jones probably works for them)</p>

<p>Fundamentally there&#39;s no way around it <em>in a Western society.</em> This culture doesn&#39;t exist in the rest of the world. The media will tell you that the folks who leave deep down in (for example) South America, who live in the middle of a jungle in a community of under a hundred people, who don&#39;t have WiFi or electricity and shit in buckets, are living in &quot;abject poverty.&quot; In reality, they are far happier &amp; healthier than their wealthy neighbors to the north. They live fulfilled lives, while we in America are stuck in a <em>trap</em>, or a <em>rat race,&quot; constantly *on the grind</em> for more monopoly money and meaningless materialistic status symbols.</p>

<p>I agree 100% and I am also on Reddit for exactly the same selfish reasons. I am here to grow my own knowledge and understanding, and engaging in debate is one way to test yourself. Sometimes I hit, sometimes I miss, but what&#39;s important is that we take these lessons and apply them to the real world. I also apologize for being a bit rude, as hard as I try to remain a source of positivity, I am still a weak man who often gets attacked for his beliefs and sometimes gets defensive. I&#39;ve been arguing with several people today, and some of this stress bled from one conversation to the next.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Funny how this goes from some dude posting about his Earth Science class to a debate of western society vs Idk Tribalism? So many things to cover. </p>

<p>So from my point of view, going as far to question western society as a whole vs &quot;tribalism&quot;(for lack of a better term) seems like what&#39;s the point. Idk why it just seems pointless to me, maybe just because it isn&#39;t something I could fathom ever possibly changing. </p>

<p>I traveled a shit ton during college all over the US and some overseas. I don&#39;t think I necessarily lack a &quot;cultured&quot; pov. </p>

<p>I also worked in a cubicle for like a year after college. That sucked ASS. But most of my coworkers loved it. And they&#39;re really good people.</p>

<p>These people while different from me, fully appreciate this lifestyle choice. Who am I to say it&#39;s shit?</p>

<p>Anyways I quit that job and set out to find a cool job. Took me a few months, but I landed in a spot where I&#39;m not in a cubicle. I&#39;m not just &quot;obedient&quot; to my boss, I talk shit when warranted. And I do things that I genuinely would enjoy doing even if I wasn&#39;t getting paid. </p>

<p>When I was in college I think I prbly thought more in-line with your thought process. But now that I&#39;ve been out for a handful of years, I don&#39;t really think it sucks. It&#39;s certainly better than only being in school and broke as shit all the time. </p>

<p>I&#39;m just hopping around with whatever comes to my mind so feel free to keep it going if you want. I&#39;ll listen and try to share insight where I can. Either way, I appreciate you. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have a lot more problems with this society than just the education system and wage slavery thing. Those are just two critical ingredients to our culture. My path in youth also took me in a different direction; I might be a bit overzealous in my desire to correct for the negative karma I&#39;ve accrued. </p>

<p>Also, there&#39;s growing evidence that this decadent lifestyle that this country has experienced during it&#39;s unipolar moment is coming to an end -- soon. From my perspective, it seems to be the <em>safer</em> choice to rage against the machine.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m nearing completing my second bachelors and not once in my near 200 credit hours of higher education have I ever encountered a &quot;Libtard professor&quot;. </p>

<p>I kinda get your point, but at the same time it&#39;s like the whole point of going to a University is to think critically and entertain multiple viewpoints. I&#39;ve never taken a college class that shutdown anyone&#39;s opposing views. </p>

<p>If you&#39;re afraid of engaging in critical thought or someone having opposing views to yours, then I would say a University is probably not for you. </p>

<p>Like if your first thing you can think of to do is go to the conspiracy subreddit and bitch about Higher Ed because your community college teaches a class that primarily would feature students that hadn&#39;t done well in school prior to that point. </p>

<p>Once you get up to advance classes like physics and calculus, the make-up of the class changes. Intro courses at community colleges have to assume you know nothing because they have no idea what prior knowledge a person is bringing in, they truly are intro.   </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what politics has to do with Science....</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There has long been an &quot;anti-science&quot; vein in American politics (closely related to anti-intellectual, anti-&quot;elite&quot;) and it appears to be particularly strong right now. The current administration has made a point of de-emphasizing science and favoring industry in regulatory agencies to a much larger degree than previous administrations, for example. Many associate this trend with conservatives and the Republican Party; in this environment calling yourself &quot;left&quot; in a science class context could be construed as calling yourself &quot;pro-science.&quot; It&#39;s a shame it&#39;s come to this but though annoying I wouldn&#39;t single out the professor for &quot;politicizing science&quot; in this scenario; the context is larger than a single classroom.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s exactly my experience with community college. I&#39;m the son of a (legal) immigrant so I couldn&#39;t afford college &amp; I didn&#39;t have the grades for it as my red-pilling began while I was in high school. That led me to start rejecting parts of the world I thought were full of shit.</p>

<p>Of course, that wasn&#39;t the best decision I ever made. I was happy to not condemn myself to four years+ of the hell you just described. Instead, I got a somewhat decent paying job doing something I love. I did that job for 7 years+. Now it&#39;s starting to pay off as my experience is more important on my resume than what college I did or didn&#39;t go to. </p>

<p>That&#39;s not to say you should drop out. The point is to educate yourself enough to take control of your future. If you drop out, you better have a realistic plan to follow through to your success. If you stay, work the shit out of the system &amp; play their bullshit games so that you win in the end. Just don&#39;t invest yourself emotionally. A man without a plan is not a man.</p>

Some students are just dumb as fuck or forced by their parents to be somewhere they really don&#39;t want to be. A school that recognizes that students are not all at the same learning level and helps challenge you at the level you&#39;re at would be better suited. With that being said, the students were better in grad school because they wanted to be there but I personally found it to be a lot easier than undergrad... which sucks for someone like me, that actually wants to learn.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My high school had regular and honors classes for freshmen and sophomores. The honors classes weren&#39;t much different, but you basically filtered out kids that didn&#39;t want to do anything hard. Juniors and Seniors could take AP classes, honors classes, or regular classes. There was no major difference between honors classes and regular classes again, except for the people who took them. </p>

<p>Kids who were sent to AP courses had done well on their state testings or ACTs. However, we had a few juniors in my class who scored a 1/5 on their AP tests. For most tests, 3s get college credit, and you literally spend the entire year preparing for this test. Someone, these people managed the lowest score possible. </p>

<p>In the US, to graduate school you simply show up, do what the teacher says, and then go home. You don&#39;t actually have to learn anything or apply yourself.  </p>

<p>As for authoritarianism, there is plenty. I had a teacher who required her classes to stand not only for the pledge but also for the principal&#39;s voice when the announcements came on.</p>

You ever stop and think those same college kids aren&#39;t just as annoyed as you doing those mindless activities? Some go to community to save money and some go bc they don&#39;t have any other options....considering you&#39;re an adult in community you&#39;re a precious mix of the two. Quit bitching and stick with it or spend 10x the price and try your luck at being accepted at a university you deem worthy enough. </p>

Just figured if classes were easier, less homework, and not real challenging course material would make it easier for said athletes to focus on their athletics in order to go  on somewhere else, just my thoughts.</p>

<p>Those kids that didn&#39;t care, didn&#39;t want to work, didn&#39;t understand.....they would not show up to any study groups, resist every suggestion, start missing class and then just disappear.  In later years they weren&#39;t even present.</p>

<p>My suggestion to you is to transfer to a University ASAP and get away from the CC.  Remember a CC degree is NOT a requirement for admission to a University.</p>

The only real displays of incompetence come from the state when it comes to creating and implementing programs for financial aid. THAT is a real shit show. It&#39;s amazing anyone gets aid at all. Treat your financial aid people nicely. Most of them are people dedicated to helping others. The pay is low and they the education requirements are very high. They do the best they can. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well since we are in conspiracy, I posted an article written by a supposed classmate of the LV shooter.  It was penned, I believe, to illustrate a proper motive seated in childhood experiences.</p>

<p>It was enlightening and yet confirmative of the system as how engineered what we thought was a free America, but one that forced students at the time, mostly depending on which side of the tracks your HS was, on what classes were offered.  Classes were geared towards satisfying basic entry level requirements  (different shop classes) that would enable a new graduate to get a job with a skill at whatever factory WAS CLOSE BY.</p>

<p>Those same classes weren&#39;t offered by the neighboring &quot;rich school&quot;.  Those kids were expected to go to college X.</p>

<p>Paddock, the shooter, kind of defied all that and gained entry into college Y.  He has to claw his way into middle management.</p>

<p>The whole jist of the article was a penned-up frustration of a brilliant mind that beat the odds, and found a way to break thru the economic glass ceiling.  But with a grudge because it was hollow.</p>

<p>Truthfully, public high schools are mostly shit. The people who do get into college are often driven there by their parents and most are still ill equipped for anything but a degree mill - which is what most schools are.</p>

I took literature, and every class we had to get in groups to answer questions about the reading we were supposed to do in preparation.

<p>The real college experience, you take a college placement test, to determine what classes you need to take. I didn&#39;t do college until about 10 years after high school, and I placed at honors level for everything but math.</p>

<p>The concept is that you continue on where you left off, unless you place at a higher level. Community colleges tend to have more older folks that haven&#39;t been in school for years, so if you placed at lower than college level, they&#39;re going to be comprehensively going over the basics.</p>

<p>Until you reach year 3+, they&#39;re not going to assume everyone knows about x.. something like doing MLA or APA citations. Higher level courses aren&#39;t going to focus on it, but they&#39;re still going to go over it.</p>

<p>I had a pretty amazing experience with my community college, and honestly the University was sub par in a lot of ways in comparison.</p>

<p>The OP reads like how someone &quot;imagines&quot; college to be, and absolutely reeks of the exact kind of posts I&#39;ve seen in r/the_Donald countless times.</p>

<p>The very fact they tried to inject political views into it, falsely, screams this person is full of shit. I&#39;ll bet they don&#39;t even live in the US.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All depends on the CC I suppose. I got my associates degree at Wake Tech in the Raleigh, NC area. They are a very respected CC in the state. They have over 70k students and multiple campuses. A couple of my teachers talked any sort of politics. My political science teacher (thankfully), my history teacher, and my American Literature teacher. </p>

<p>Thankfully my political science teacher completely shielded his political beliefs from us. I still don&#39;t know his beliefs but I can only guess because I played against his church in a softball league. My history teacher was an admitted &quot;lefty&quot; and was a black female. Thankfully she was completely fair when it came to grading. You could make a &quot;right wing&quot; argument and if it was supported, rational, and well written she would give it a good grade. My English lit teacher was a bit wacky and talked politics a bit. He also played the Didgeridoo for a few minutes during class so I think he was just a bit off (I think you either have to be a bit off or dry as dust to be an American Lit teacher but that is just me).</p>

<p>The students were all over the spectrum. There was everything from purple hair lesbian feminists to 30 year old Alpha male vets. Most of the students were pretty average. Most were decent students. They weren&#39;t brainiacs but that is obviously rare. Most were just young people working their way through college. Obviously there were stupid students like the ones who&#39;d walk in 30 minutes into a 50 minute class all the time and the idiot who got a tattoo of a heart on his ass because he was drunk one night but there are idiots everywhere.</p>

<p>My CC experience was great and I still encourage people to go there instead of a 4 year college if they don&#39;t know what they want to do.</p>

<p>I agree. In fact, I find that most of the kids are far beyond the material being taught in the courses. The courses are of course full to the brim with bad technique and junk material. Are there any actual experts out there that think memorizing trivia and short answer tests are an effective standard for designing an education system?</p>
