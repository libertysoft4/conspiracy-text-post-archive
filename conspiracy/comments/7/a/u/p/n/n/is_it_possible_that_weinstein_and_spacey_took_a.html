And surely some of us will think we are making progress, which we ultimately are. (We are forcing them to delve into their emergency plan bin and run damage control/limited hangouts). </p>

<p>But I can&#39;t help but think that maybe the elite are sacrificing notable public figures to try and appease the conspiracy community who is demanding arrests for sexual abuse and pedophilia. This ultimately takes the heat off of them. I&#39;m talking the sick bastards at the top of the pyramid. Rothschilds, rockefellers, Kissinger, Bushes, Clinton&#39;s, I think the social engineers are under the impression that they can make this pizzagate and pedogate culture a &quot;passing phase&quot;. Toss us some scraps and we&#39;ll go home pleased...</p>

<p>We need to stay on these people until the entire hive is exposed. The shadow elite in particular need to see their day in court and have their dark sick religion and rigged economy crimes exposed to the masses. Use the massive momentum we have now to keep exposing others and put pressure on them all until everyone is aware of this sick secret culture and their rigged economy. </p>

<p>Weinstein, everybody just fucking hated. One of the biggest bullies and assholes in Hollywood. Once he stopped making people money, there was no reason to keep him around. Unless maybe he was Mossad and this is some kind of military takeout from our side. Either way, his fuse burned out.</p>

<p>Still, now it might be spinning out of their control. When people start talking about David Geffen, you know shit&#39;s getting real.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>NYPD has stated they are building a Rape Case against Weinstein, so I&#39;m not sure if any amount of money would make someone willing to experience the social shame and imprisonment that follows such a charge. I agree though, that they may be voluntarily sacrificing these people, but I doubt it is because Weinstein or Spacey agreed to it. If you play the game, you run the risk of being collateral damage, the chickens are merely coming home to roost for these monsters. </p>

<p>I think even those names are only limited hangouts. The real controlling powers are the nobilities and bloodlines whose names you seldom hear about, though occasionally they do make the rounds in conspiracy circles, at least.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look at the laws for pedophilia and the punishment it entails for a first offense. It is a slap on the wrist while the child will have forever been changed. It doesn&#39;t even matter if they get convicted unless it is for multiple counts. Or else max they will spend in Jail is 3.5 years, with good time they will be out much sooner than that. </p>

<p>So unless we start passing laws that better protect our youngest and most vulnerable and issue out real punishments for these vile crimes we wont ever see a stop to it.</p>

When the face of pedophilia is creepy disgusting old men, its easy to make it taboo and demonize it.

Then maybe people get the idea &quot;oh maybe theres more to this than i thought, maybe its not so bad. Then boom years later you have a society thats been slowly conditioned to accept pedophilia</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Personally, I despise the term conspiracy whatever. Just because someone thinks the MSM&#39;s account of what happen in LV is fishy, doesn&#39;t make one a conspiracy theorist. I&#39;m not a conspiracy theorist, however I do question everything. I question everything in my professional field, and that is a great thing. This is how we improve. MSM are companies. They have their own agendas. I have the right and responsibly to think critically and question everything they have to say. We&#39;re all just people who don&#39;t buy the crap they are peddling. </p>
