    <div class="md"><p>To give you just one example, here is their piece from 2005, where they allege there was no insider trading concerning 9/11.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.snopes.com/rumors/putcall.asp">http://www.snopes.com/rumors/putcall.asp</a></p>

<p>Only a year later Poteshman published his article which you can read here:</p>

<p><a href="https://911inacademia.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/a-poteshman-journal-of-business-2006-unusual-option-market-activity-and-the-9-11-attacks.pdf">https://911inacademia.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/a-poteshman-journal-of-business-2006-unusual-option-market-activity-and-the-9-11-attacks.pdf</a></p>

<p>That is one of at least 3 that I know of that deal with insider trading, and that found that it was happening.</p>

<p>Which brings me back to Snopes. Their methodology seems to consist of only regurgitating MSM sources. This makes an insidious loop where they use MSM to &#39;debunk&#39;, and the MSM use Snopes to reinforce the narrative they are pushing. It is just an extension of manufacturing of consent. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Snopes:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On 10 September 2001, another uneventful news day, American Airlines’ option volume was 4,516 puts and 748 calls, a ratio of 6:1 on yet another day when by rights these options should have been trading even. No other airline stocks were affected; only United and American were shorted in this fashion.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Poteshman:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I conclude that option market activity does provide evidence that is consistent with the terrorists or their associates having traded ahead of the September 11 attacks.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Chesney and Crameri:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the airline sector 8 out of 15 of the selected transactions can be traced back to the terrorist attacks of 9/11. Companies like American Airlines, United Airlines, Boeing and to a lesser extent Delta Air Lines and KLM seem to have been targets for informed trading activities in the period leading up to the attacks. The number of new put options issued during that period is statistically high and the total gains Gt realized by exercising these options amount to more than $16 million. These findings support the evidence in Poteshman (2006) who also documents unusual activities in the option market before the terrorist attacks. Appendix B discusses in details our detected option informed trades before 9/11.</p>

<p>Snopes;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But it was during the final few trading days (the market closes on weekends) that the most unusual variances in activity occurred. Bloomberg data showed that on 6 September 2001, the Thursday before that black Tuesday, put-option volume in UAL stock was nearly 100 times higher than normal: 2,000 options versus 27 on the previous
day.</p>

<p>On 6 and 7 September 2001, the Chicago Board Options Exchange handled 4,744 put options for United Airlines’ stock, translating into 474,000 shares, compared with just 396 call options, or 39,600 shares. On a day that the put-to-call ratio would normally have been expected to be roughly 1:1 (no negative news stories about United had broken), it was instead 12:1.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>See, I can cherry pick too.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is the only true thing you stated so far.  </p>

<p>Here is the full conclusion Poteshman makes:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The  option  market  volume  ratios  considered  do  not  provide  evidence  of
unusual option market trading in the days leading up to September 11. The
volume ratios, however, are constructed out of long and short put volume and
long  and  short  call  volume;  simply  buying  puts  would  have  been  the  most
straightforward  way  for  someone  to  have  traded  in  the  option  market  on
foreknowledge of the attacks. A measure of abnormal long put volume was
also examined and seen to be at abnormally high levels in the days leading
up to the attacks. Consequently, the paper concludes that there is evidence of
unusual option  market  activity  in the days leading up to September 11 that
is consistent with investors trading on advance knowledge of the attacks.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And to add a third paper... by Wong, Thompson and Teh that showed this was occuring:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In addition, we conclude that there is evidence of abnormal trading in the September 2001 OTM, ATM and ITM SPX index put options immediately after the 9-11 attacks. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;evidence of unusual [...] activity&quot; and &quot;evidence of abnormal trading&quot; is not proof of the claim that Snopes declared false.</p>

<p>and you keep conveniently forgetting about this whole thing:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Highly publicized allegations of insider trading in advance of 9/11 generally rest on reports of unusual pre-9/11 trading activity in companies whose stock plummeted after the attacks. Some unusual trading did in fact occur, but each such trade proved to have an innocuous explanation. For example, the volume of put options — instruments that pay off only when a stock drops in price — surged in the parent companies of United Airlines on September 6 and American Airlines on September 10 — highly suspicious trading on its face. Yet, further investigation has revealed that the trading had no connection with 9/11. A single U.S.-based institutional investor with no conceivable ties to al Qaeda purchased 95 percent of the UAL puts on September 6 as part of a trading strategy that also included buying 115,000 shares of American on September 10. Similarly, much of the seemingly suspicious trading in American on September 10 was traced to a specific U.S.-based options trading newsletter, faxed to its subscribers on Sunday, September 9, which recommended these trades. The SEC and FBI, aided by other agencies and the securities industry, devoted enormous resources to investigating this issue, including securing the cooperation of many foreign governments. These investigators have found that the apparently suspicious consistently proved innocuous.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here is Snopes:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the days just prior to the 11 September 2001, large quantities of stock in United and American Airlines were traded by persons with foreknowledge of the upcoming 9/11 attacks.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here is Potashman:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I conclude that option market activity does provide evidence that is consistent with the terrorists or their associates having traded ahead of the September 11 attacks.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So we see that the evidence is there, and was independently corroborated, not just in the airline sector, but the banking sector as well.  But let us continue on...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The SEC and FBI, aided by other agencies and the securities industry, devoted enormous resources to investigating this issue, including securing the cooperation of many foreign governments. These investigators have found that the apparently suspicious consistently proved innocuous.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let us be clear on the what they found.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The
SEC
told
the
FBI
that
some
of these
29.
accounts
were
&#39;either
hedge
funds
or proprietary
accounts
that
had
been
in existence
for
years.
As
of September
21,2001,
the
SEC
and/or
the
relevant
securities
exchanges
were
still
investigating
other
of the
29
accounts.
At
the
September
21
meeting,
the
SEC
referred
two
suspicious
accounts
to the
FBI
for
investigation</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Those 29 accounts were investigated through interviews only. </p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/R5xrkzU.png">https://i.imgur.com/R5xrkzU.png</a></p>

<p>They identified Stratsec, and dismissed it as not related to terrorist activity because it had people connected to the US government. </p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/eLHic4G.png">https://i.imgur.com/eLHic4G.png</a></p>

<p>They did not investigate foreign accounts, rather they relied on investigations of foreign regulatory agencies.</p>

<p>Concenring commodities and treasuries, the FBI did not even investigate, rather took the preliminary findings of CFTC at face value.</p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/Dh1UVSK.png">https://i.imgur.com/Dh1UVSK.png</a></p>

<p>FBI feigns ignorance about hard drives shipped overseas, and provide a stellar argument that, &#39;everything was turned to powder&#39;, a false statement if there was one. </p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/3IlrPZ8.png">https://i.imgur.com/3IlrPZ8.png</a></p>

<p>So to summerize, the correct statement to say is that the 9/11 Commission and the FBI claimed they found no links to Al-Quaeda and terrorism.   What is not the right claim, is that </p>
