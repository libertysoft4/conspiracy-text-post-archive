        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;m looking to hear this subs views on the IMF, Central Banking and Crypto Currency...</p>

<p>I have recently picked up some Bitcoins to see how the systems work (buying/selling/wallets/hardware etc), and I am now looking around at other cryptos. It then struck me that if i&#39;m looking to buy currency that will rise, then surly I need back the one thats &quot;popular&quot;. But what is &quot;popular&quot;? I am a conspiracy type, so I came to the conclusion that any serious money to be had, will come from a crypto used by the IMF and pushed by central banks. As in, the rich need to get richer, else its not going to happen. The IMF are thinking of creating their own crypto, will other central banks do the same? Could we have Great British Bit and the US Bit in exchange for GBP and USD?</p>

<p>Doesn&#39;t Crypto Currency <em>have</em> to be changed and forced into the way current money systems work? Coins like Bitcoin will fall once central banks use their own? Is it even possible to use Crypto for central banking as they can&#39;t just print and demand interest on it as easily. Will we run Fiat and Crypto side by side for as long as banks can string it out? Will governments step in and stop large purchases, eg homes, being bought in Crypto? Will they stop people being paid in crypto for work, as they cant &quot;wet their beak&quot;? </p>

<p>&quot;They&quot; need to control this, but how?</p>

<p>Just interested in some opinions, and conspiracy around the subject. Lots of users here are up on the central banking con, big business and government corruption, so the discussions could be very interesting.</p>

<p>In theory, it is entirely possible to devise a cryptocurrency which allows some central authority to create new currency on demand.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have invested in a small amount of bitcoin (0.35 BTC so far), but I am very uncertain about bitcoins long term future. Banks and governments have expressed a great deal of interest in blockchain technology, and some have already announced some plans of how they might use it. I can definitely see a future where states begin issuing their own cryptocurrencies. Blockchain technology has the potential to give states (and banks) all of the same powers they have over traditional fiat currency and more. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, if you take a look around right now, as an exemple, UK has somehow stable economy, no hyperinflation , people can get their food, services etc. They don&#39;t really have a need for Bitcoin right now.</p>

<p>Were as Bitcoin thrives in Venezuela, Zimbabwe, etc. Countries that have lost faith in the system , as the system literally fucked up.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperinflation_in_Zimbabwe">This is a great exemle</a> and should be read by everyone. This dosen&#39;t even relate to bitcoin , as much as it&#39;s a warning about the system itself.</p>

<p>...<em>Zimbabwe&#39;s peak month of inflation is estimated at 79.6 billion percent in mid-November 2008..</em></p>

<p>What this means is, that you could enter a store with 10$ to buy a bread, and by the time you get to the counter, the bread would worth 15$ . It sounds surreal, and yet, it stands to prove that if people loose faith in their currency, and the system just prints more to somehow keep the weels in motion..crazy things can happend.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, blocksize increase is really not a good solution. Not right now at least. see by increasing the blocksize, you decrease the number of people that could run  a node. As it is right now a BTC node, can be run by every computer, even 10+ years old. This helps keep the network spreaded , decentralised and therefore safe.</p>

<p>So instead of increasing the blocksize, <strong>SegWit</strong> was implemented(that stores a part of transactions on a sidechain, increasing the numer or transactions that can enter a block) , and SegWit provides us with support to implement <strong>Lighting Network</strong> , which will allow us to make an infinite number of transactions from 2 points, like all the buyers from Amazon to Amazon Server, and at the end of the day, all this is calculated as one transaction and stored in the blockchain.</p>

<p>So , there is work being done to scale it but ,and this is important, as all good things, this should not and will not be rushed.</p>

<p>As I see it, we only have one chance at this. We must not drop the ball.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dont listen to this guy, Bitcoin BTC is the crypto at @6500.00 is the real bitcoin.  BCH is Bitcoin Cash @495.00 is the result of a contentious hardfork.  Do your reasearch, but this guy is a speculator looking to get more people int BCH so he can pump and dump</p>
