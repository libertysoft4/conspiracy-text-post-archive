<p>the other room is just a normal sized room with presumably no pillars. the room with the no reason smashed window. mayeb that room was the initial trial room but too small to stage. so they switched to the suite.</p>

<p>Not necessarily.  Paddock&#39;s body was found in the living room of suite 32-135.  The shot could have been in the bedroom of the suite.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://imgur.com/aXYePUf">Here&#39;s the floor plan of just the suite</a></strong></p>

<p>You can see that the bedroom and bathroom with the tub has doors that can close it off from the living area.  It&#39;s technically a separate room from the living/bar/powder room.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And the article specifically said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>&quot;The police firearm *</em>went off inside the suite** sometime after officers made entry, the sheriff said. But the round or rounds were not fired in the same room where gunman Stephen Paddock was found dead with what has been described as a self-inflicted gunshot wound.&quot;*</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t think the adjoining room (32-134) counts as being &quot;inside the suite,&quot; so I assumed bedroom as well. But I suppose this could just be semantics and investigators are referring to the entire hotel crime scene as &quot;the suite.&quot; </p>

<p>And we still have no evidence that 32-134 was rented out under Paddock&#39;s name, which I find odd. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Speaking of the other room (32-134) did anyone else find it odd that there was crime scene tape over the door to the suite (32-135) but no crime scene tape over the other door at all.  I would think there would at least be crime scene tape around the room service cart which is supposedly where Paddock had the cameras.</p>

<p>Someone put thiose plates on the arts and then wheeled the cart in front of the door of 32-134.  Wouldn&#39;t you want to try and get fingerprints on the plates to figure out whose room they had come from?  If they came from Paddock&#39;s suite, there seemed to be a lot of dishes for just one person&#39;s meal.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It looked like there was food left on one of the plates - something black. I always wondered - did Paddock just see a room service cart further down the hallway, decided it would be a good way to set up his cameras and pull it down to his area?  Or had he previously ordered food and kept the service cart in his room until he was ready to use it?</p>

<p>It seems like the hotel could run a check and see what rooms on that wing got room service that day and figure out whose food that was based on the number of plates and the food remains.</p>

<p>Did they fingerprint the cart or the dishes?  If it came from Paddock&#39;s suite, were there any other fingerprints found that can&#39;t be attributed to hotel staff?</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://imgur.com/ECCmfML">Room Service Cart Photo</a></strong></p>

<p>I see at least two dinner plates, four salad sized plates and a fifth one holding jelly or butter, and two water bottles. If it came from Paddock&#39;s suite, it seems like a lot for one meal. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why did SWAT breach into 135 and did they do it from the hallway or via 134 ?  SWAT first breached into 135. Officers entered the room and found Paddock dead (per LVPD). Door connecting the 2 rooms was locked from the 134 side, is my understanding. So SWAT breached in an abundance of caution vs using the room key and hallway door ? Just asking since FBI/PD hasn’t explained the rationale, I don’t think. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah they said it was done from the hallway side, officers camped out in stairwell right next to suspects door then breached from the hallway even though they could all see a camera on the room service cart aimed at the stairwell they just all decided to hang around in the stairwell and stand in the hallway setting breach charges.
Apparently they breached the door even though it had a hole in it large enough for officers to clearly see the rifle laying on the floor behind the door. I would have imagined if a door had 200 rounds fired through it as per the official story that you wouldnt need to breach it. </p>

<p>And did they really stand in front of the door and breach it knowing that it had just had massive amounts of automatic fire come through the door moments earlier? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, several scenarios. Most plausible to me is an anti-gun laundering sting operation going on there for several days. Would explain the video/tech in the room (which explains Sheriffs statement that “SWAT breach wasn’t delayed, we were methodical since we knew the shooter had stopped - cops had audio/video on the room via ATF tech).</p>

<p>Cartel responded to the operation with force. Afterward, It may have been necessary to get CI’s off the floor, Fed agents off the floor if CIA was involved, before LVPD occupied 32.</p>

<p>Or, ISIS / AQ hijacked the op and turned weapons on agents and then citizens. In addition to CI’s, CIA, there may be dead terrorist bodies wearing stolen LVPD / FBI / MB uniforms. </p>

<p>If it was an accident, I wouldn’t even be surprised. These guys entered a high stress situation with <em>probably</em> little to no combat training. They’re cops, not soldiers. They know how to shoot, not survive a firefight. I’d be scared shitless. </p>

<p>They just witnessed the largest shooting in American history and now they’re going after the person(s) responsible. Sounded like automatic gunfire - what else could they have in that room? I’d be out of my fuckin mind with stress and a little panic. </p>

<p>Yes it was his room – or rather, his suite. Just not the room (within that suite) where Paddock was found dead).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The police firearm went off inside the suite sometime after officers made entry, the sheriff said. But the round or rounds were not fired in the same room where gunman Stephen Paddock was found dead with what has been described as a self-inflicted gunshot wound.</p>

<p>So presumably, in one of the bedrooms (whereas Paddock was found in the main living area). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right before the 2 single shots in the &quot;bus stop vid&quot;, the police scanner has a voice saying they have snipers in position asking if 32nd floor is evacuated (which seemed like an odd question, as the shooting is only 10 minutes in).  Next thing you hear on scanner is &quot;negative, nothing is evacuated,&quot; followed by 2 shots, the first of which caused glass to fall from the building (according to the blonde girl at the bus stop). Seems to me like a sniper could&#39;ve ended this but for some reason the public can&#39;t handle the truth, so they give us lies. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I only assumed that snipers were &quot;in position&quot; based on the context of the question about evacuation. It sounded like they had snipers, likely with Paddock in their sights and wanted to pull the trigger. It seems like if snipers were to have killed Paddock, they can&#39;t just come out and admit it for whatever reason. Kinda like how they couldn&#39;t admit they shot that plane down over PA on 9/11. The suicide story is easier for the public to stomach.</p>

There&#39;s no reason I can come up with why &quot;we took out the killer&quot; makes them look bad.. it looks more suspicious that he killed himself, and since that&#39;s the story they went with, that makes them look worse.. it&#39;s believable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good explanation, although doesn&#39;t explain why they wanted to send a sniper UP to floor 32, the floor of the shooting....That&#39;s the last place you want to have a sniper.
And why was it essential that ONLY the suspect be on the floor for the  &quot; C-I uh sniper &quot;  to go up? Why did civilians HAVE to be cleared ?  So civilians couldn&#39;t report the truth imo</p>
