    <div class="md"><p>Indeed.   According to the Georgia Guidestones they think they need only 500 million of us.    Their lifestyle is much more than relaxing on a plantation with servants.  It takes entire cities, universities, factories and infrastructure to maintain the technology we have now.  Something luxurious like a smart phone or a private jet require tens of thousands of people to design and take from mines to fabrication, then tens of thousands more to maintain the infrastructure that make them work.   </p>

<p>The sinister part is that the elite think that is the natural order of how things are supposed to be.  That their proper place is ruling as master above many slaves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Control through fear is part of the reason we got here.  Have you ever read Osama bin Laden&#39;s letter to the American ppl?  While i fundamentally disagree with how he tried to make change he said if the US govt accepts collateral damage of his ppl he must do the same.  Its a fucked up world &amp; we will never be able to fully control things ppl do.  We can only recognize it &amp; share how we see things &amp; hopefully that leads to change.  I dont know if there are any governments in the world that actually represent regular people.</p>

<p>Trump has nothing to do with outing Hollywood pedos. He is one. He&#39;s an elite who&#39;s been around Hollywood and even sought to put himself in a movie with a child actor.</p>

<p>Pro sports? Nothing but mad people protesting because of their political beliefs on both sides.</p>
