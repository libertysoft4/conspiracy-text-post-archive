        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Ok, so let&#39;s see - Kosovo is...Kosovo?? Well I am 100% sure that it was Serbian 700 years ago <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Kosovo">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Kosovo</a></p>

<p>Now lets go to the 90&#39;s. Adem Jashari was killed in his house, everybody in that house got an ultimatum, (probably) nobody was allowed to leave, Serbian special forces killed everybody in the house. NATO got &quot;mad&quot; and they started an attack on Serbia (btw. the youngest child who was killed with the bombs is Milica Rakic - she was just 3 years old. If that happened with example Russia, CNN, FOX and every reporters will go like: RUSSIA IS KILLING CHILDREN etc. i googled &quot;Milica Rakic&quot; - no articles on english, just on serbian). </p>

<p>The Albanians, supported by NATO, attacked from Kosare (see: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Ko%C5%A1are">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Košare</a> ), NATO cared so much about them that they killed 60 Albanians. After the bombing, thousands of Serbs were forced to leave from their homes - to Serbia (mostly Belgrade). Anyway after the war, hundreds of Serbs were missing, and those who stayed in their homes were getting attacked, and in some cases killed. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s go to 2004. Watch this video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L87WAGJD3Gg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L87WAGJD3Gg</a> . You heard for that? Probably not. A lot of churches were burned ( <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=veNNiJnaAxU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=veNNiJnaAxU</a> ), and a lot of Serbs were killed. What was NATO doing about this? Nothing, KFOR werent helping. </p>

<p>So, why? Probably because they didnt care for Serbs, they only cared for their organs (kidney can be sold for 160K$, a human has 2 kidneys, so just for kidneys you can get 320K$) and drug dealing. KLA is just a terrorist organisation, funded by NATO. </p>

<p>2017 - Kosovo&#39;s prime minister is Ramush Haradinaj (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramush_Haradinaj">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramush_Haradinaj</a> Read: Trial for war crimes at ICTY ), there is evidence against him. He and his &quot;army&quot; raped under-age Serbs. And he wasnt killing just Serbs, he was also killing Albanians who didnt want to do those crimes.</p>

<p>There is a lot more to tell, but I simply cant put everything in one post, I still think that as soon as Kosovo become useless to NATO, they will just stop supporting it. I believe that this will happen in next 15-25 years.</p>

<p>TL;DR: Kosovo was just created for the organs harvest, and for drug dealing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Human trafficking too. </p>

<p>&quot;Since the establishment of the United Nations Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) in 1999, It has been known to the international community that Kosovo is a major destination territory for human trafficking, women and young girls trafficked into forced prostitution.&quot;</p>

<p>No wonder Nato and the Clintons love Kosovo. I&#39;m sure Bill had a great reason for Operation Deliberate Force. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh yes, that reminds me on the event that took place in May, this year. </p>

<p>One girl (12) was just casually walking (it was 22:00), when a man who spoke serbian bad and had an albanian accent, grabbed her for hand and tried to take her to the darker part of the street. She somehow freed herself and managed to run away. </p>

<p>Her parent told that to the police (KPS, Kosovo&#39;s Police Service), nothing. I havent heard that they tried to find the kidnapper</p>

    <div class="md"><p>great post. Very Unfortunate for what happened there and how the American press spun the Clinton/NATO/Kosovo BS. the Balkans have always seen war through the ages.

    <div class="md"><p>I was in Kosovo in 2004 part of KFOR. The 2004 riots happened the day of my first day off since I got in country. The Greeks and the French abandoned their posts and shut themselves up in their bases. The US forces which I was a part of had to split themselves into many pieces to at least try and cover as much ground as we could. My platoon of 30 or so guys had the task of covering the area that the french did. So instead of running constant patrols we just shut down the main road and checked every vehicle/person coming down that road. I also didn&#39;t get to sleep for 3 days. </p>

<p>I say this only to point out that things could have been done way better. Then the US KFOR people ended up doing the greeks job of patrolling their area for nearly a month after the riots calmed down. I admit it was awesome walking around in more populated place rather than small towns for a change. Uroševac / Ferizaj is where my platoon had to do the greeks job of patrolling. we even had to guard the burned down churches for some fucking reason.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>At the beginning of the video around starting around 1:17 he says no one is thinking about whether or not they should be following this or that order. Honestly to me that&#39;s not true at all. We&#39;re all taught to only follow orders that are lawful.</p>

<p>But he may be talking about people who will do anything they&#39;re told. I&#39;ve never met people like that during my time in but they certainly exist. Really I have no strong opinions on what he said.</p>

<p>Depending on how a person decides to read into what he&#39;s saying one could get two entirely different meanings from what he said.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The 700 years as part of Serbia thing is complete BS. Serbia, Kosovo, Albania, etc were all part of the Ottoman empire for 700 years. When that fell apart, Serbia took Kosovo, a country in which 80% of the population spoke Albanian, lived Albanian culture, and whose ancestors were all Albanian. </p>

<p>That increased to 88% at the time they gained their independence. </p>

<p>As with all new countries in which brand new governments are set up, there are people that go in and exploit the people. </p>

<p>My wife is Albanian. She told me stories of when she was a school girl in the early 90&#39;s in which men from Italy would arrive in Albania, begin to date an Albanian woman, marry her in a short amount of time, then &quot;move&quot; back to Italy. Upon arrival, the woman was used as a sex slave. She would be forced to call her parents, and with a gun to her head talk about how great life was in Italy with her husband. </p>

<p>This was also rampant in Kosovo, as the government was not equipped to handle or put a stop to all of this. As such there was a HUGE influx of sex slavers that would go in and sway young women into leaving the country afterwhich they would be forced into sexual slavery. </p>

<p>The sex trade was not the only thing the women were used for. There WAS some organ harvesting going on, though it was mostly black market dealings and was not condoned by any government entity. It was simply something that happened. </p>

<p>You have a brand new country that is essentially third world in close proximity to countries that are 1st world countries. That kind of exploitation is bound to happen to a degree. </p>

<p>This is all going off of the stories my wife, my in-laws, and the people I met when I visited Albania told me. It&#39;s better now (23 years later) but it still does happen. </p>
