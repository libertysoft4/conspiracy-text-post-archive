<blockquote>
<p>Here’s what’s sad... it’s not a fucking LARP y’all and by the time it’s over, you’re going to realize EXACTLY how much time and effort people have been putting in to this board, to give you the truth. Some of us, for MONTHS.</p>

<p>Most of us have admitted we aren’t daily /pol/ posters. We know this. It doesn’t make us a shill or a LARP. It makes us people purposefully coming here, with a specific goal. I told y’all about Trump’s willingness to extend a hand and make deals with those he was willing to work with and salvage from the “swamp”, to include “deal making”/“negotiating” with Congress, our departments and agencies, the ME, Russia, China, etc. months ago. I told you about SR, Awan’s, Manafort would walk, Tony would be indicted (and it will be confirmed soon), etc. since May.</p>

<p>I’ve sat back and watched all these “QAnon” posts because frankly, brah is on point. I haven’t personally felt compelled to post at all. He’s doing a fantastic job. If anything, I’ve realized what’s kills me in here, is my wall boards of detailed paragraphs but alas, I’m not a writer. QAnon is breaking down a ton of detail in a more /pol/-friendly format.</p>

<p>So, enjoy the breadcrumbs y’all. You’re not being larped, you’re being leaked to. Great job cracking the /pol/ post formatting, Q. You’re super effective and 100% accurate.</p>

<p>FBI</p>

<p>CIA</p>

<p>FED </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Hi y’all! Here’s what I tried to post in last thread before it got archived. Connects Huma, Talal and unironically, 9/11 and Vegas. &quot;</p>

<p>&quot;True, as related to Pakistan. Specifically those Pakistani’s that helped coordinate 9/11 with the Talal faction of the royal family. This is the faction Bush immunized and had securely extracted from the US after they watched 9/11 go down. Just like they were about to watch Vegas go, you know...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Do you realize we literally averted a much larger 9/11, thanks to today? Keep chasing old news about Saudi Royals backchanneling money to the CF. The Saudi arrests had nothing to do with “money laundering”. They’ve been laundering money back and forth for decades. Today was much, much fucking bigger. And you’re all wrong about Alice and Wonderland and Tony. He’s been detained.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;WWII was the biggest 9/11 grade psyop ever and Hitler was no more in control or to blame than Bin Laden.&quot;</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p><a href="https://archive.4plebs.org/pol/search/uid/48ri1S5J/order/asc/">8 more Mega&#39;s posts in CBTS #51: DOPEY PRINCE ARRESTED! HAD TIES TO MANDALAY BAY</a> (8 posts)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Gee, I’m loving Q and I know my walls of paragraphs annoy /pol/, but he could’ve just saved y’all the time/threads and told y’all that the Saudi’s responsible for 9/11 and Vegas are the ones who were gonna try to pull off another Trump attack this weekend... and their ring leader was arrested today.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not on point mate. They wouldn&#39;t indict Tony and John at the same time for one, so either that&#39;s a spin off theory that came from the info they dropped, or if it indeed came directly from Q-Anon then they are full of it.

I am THE REALEST, and am taking some time out of my busy day to let you American Patriots know that what&#39;s going on here, OK, which should be obvious for anyone as smart as me, I am the smartest, is the Saudis and the Japanese are teaming up with Trump to arrest Hillary Clinton, throw all the (((bankers))) in a pedo-sex dungeon, and make the Chinese realize they better behave or they&#39;ll be put in their place too. It will happen at 11:17 on 11-7. Well, OK, first arresting Hillary, then 11/8 arresting the bankers. That&#39;s why I left the country. I mean that&#39;s why Trump left the country, obvs. Oh also everyone ARRESTED for pedo sex and demon worship. EVIL! And P.S., for you FAKE NEWS LOSERS why can&#39;t you see that sharing with POL is just my hobby, but my job is super-real, total Oval Office, which by the way has never looked better, anyway, total White House insider who shares all the secrets.
