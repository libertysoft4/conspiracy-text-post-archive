<p>Brazile writes that she was haunted by the still-unsolved murder of DNC data staffer Seth Rich and feared for her own life, shutting the blinds to her office window so snipers could not see her and installing surveillance cameras at her home. She wonders whether Russians had placed a listening device in plants in the DNC executive suite.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The narrative they&#39;re trying to push is that Russians interfered with the elections. Of course they&#39;d want to make it seem like Seth Rich was manipulated by the Russians to leak incriminating emails and then killed to frame Clinton.

    <div class="md"><p>Actually if you concede that Russia has been using an active propaganda campaign to try to control the narrative or spin stories, it might actually make sense that Russia would put out a false conspiracy theory that Clinton or the DNC had Seth Rich, their own person, killed. </p>

<p>But if you look at his death, if the DNC or Clinton truly killed him, couldn&#39;t they do better than shooting him twice in the back and in what&#39;s been called a botched robbery? Is the theory is that Clinton is that sinister that she kills her own people and has it intentionally look suspicious? Or is she that clumsy that her killers are this bad?</p>

<p>What if the Russians actually did kill him, but the police don&#39;t find anything and rule it a botched robbery? The Russians might blame Clinton because it looks shady enough and muddies the water if anything was found pointing to others.</p>

<p>Also, it turns out that Russian military intelligence posing as guccifer 2.0 edited the wordpress document that Assange linked to on wikileaks&#39; twitter page, that listed the DNC hacked emails. Added to a few of the documents in those emails were the word &quot;confidential&quot; that were not on the original emails. However, there wasn&#39;t actually anything incriminating in the wordpress document that showed those 1000s of emails. No one bothered to actually check those emails, it just sounded shady knowing those leaked emails existed, therefore there must be something bad in them.</p>

<p>Assange said in an interview that he was timing the release of the email leaks with the DNC convention for maximum political effect. Assange is a known for disliking Clinton, and wikileaks has not criticized or released leaks about Russia. People believe that  Seth Rich&#39;s death is what Assange was referring to when he said &quot;there are consequences to leaking,&quot; but I haven&#39;t been able to find a reliable source on that.</p>

<p>I realize this could just grasping at straws, but if Donna Brazile is serious (and if she is claiming Russia is responsible for Rich&#39;s death, publicly) that might actually be why there were theories quick to blame Clinton for his death-- a Russian disinformation campaign brought to you by a building full of Russian trolls pretending to be Americans and farming artificial outrage and trying to divide all sides without actually being for anything.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Turns out it&#39;s not that crazy to think Assange is working with Russia (or at the very least, compromised himself). He met with RT editor&#39;s at the London Ecuadorian embassy.</p>

<p>from the US Director of National Intelligence, January 6th, 2017: dni.gov/files/documents/ICA_2017_01.pdf</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Public Disclosures of Russian-Collected Data.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>We assess with high confidence that the GRU used the Guccifer 2.0 persona, DCLeaks.com, and WikiLeaks to release US victim data obtained in cyber operations publicly and in exclusives to media outlets.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li><p>Guccifer 2.0, who claimed to be an independent Romanian hacker, made multiple contradictory statements and false claims about his likely Russian identity throughout the election. Press reporting suggests more than one person claiming to be Guccifer 2.0 interacted with journalists.</p></li>
<li><p>Content that we assess was taken from e-mail accounts targeted by the GRU in March 2016 appeared on DCLeaks.com starting in June. We assess with high confidence that the GRU relayed material it acquired from the DNC and senior Democratic officials to WikiLeaks. Moscow most likely chose WikiLeaks because of its selfproclaimed reputation for authenticity. Disclosures through WikiLeaks did not contain any evident forgeries.</p></li>
<li><p>In early September, Putin said publicly it was important the DNC data was exposed to WikiLeaks, calling the search for the source of the leaks a distraction and denying Russian “state-level” involvement.</p></li>
<li><p>The Kremlin’s principal international propaganda outlet RT (formerly Russia Today) has actively collaborated with WikiLeaks. <strong>RT’s editor-in-chief visited WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London in August 2013, where they discussed renewing his broadcast contract with RT, according to Russian and Western media. Russian media subsequently announced that RT had become &quot;the only Russian media company&quot; to partner with WikiLeaks and had received access to &quot;new leaks of secret information.&quot; RT routinely gives Assange sympathetic coverage and provides him a platform to denounce the United States.</strong></p></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>These election-related disclosures reflect a pattern of Russian intelligence using hacked information in targeted influence efforts against targets such as Olympic athletes and other foreign governments. Such efforts have included releasing or altering personal data, defacing websites, or releasing emails.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>A prominent target since the 2016 Summer Olympics has been the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), with leaks that we assess to have originated with the GRU and that have involved data on US athletes. Russia collected on some Republican-affiliated targets but did not conduct a comparable disclosure campaign</li>

Im not sure it makes her lose credibility, she knows more than we do for sure. Like I said if anything she would have a better idea that it wasn&#39;t the russians hearing things through the grapevine. </p>

<p>I think if anything its projection and her just covering her ass throwing that in at the end since there are probably multiple people out there who dont want her bringing it up at all, or she could just be misdirecting blame on purpose. Who knows.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I totally agree. All of her statements pointed to Russian surveillance. The DNC most likely knew Seth had the files but it sure looks like the Russians got them from Seth. Seth shopped the files looking for a buyer. One being Wikileaks since they recently offered cash for data. I think the Russians got to Seth then used Wikileaks to distribute the files. His murder (or hit) was probably the grab for the drive containing the files. The robbery wasn’t botched they only took a thumb drive. </p>
