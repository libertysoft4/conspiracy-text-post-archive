        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I just got done watching an episode of Parks and Recreation on Netflix. The episode was called &quot;Fluoride&quot; and was about passing legislation to put fluoride in the water supply. The main proponents for fluoride was it&#39;s good for teeth and &quot;good for you&quot;. This arguement was repeated multiple times. I do agree that fluoride may not be harmful in small amounts but if it&#39;s in the water we drink everyday that adds up. I also find it ironic how we aren&#39;t supposed to swallow toothpaste because of the fluoride but somehow it&#39;s okay in our water. Not really sure where I was going with this but I felt like sharing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>toxin is a buzzword, though. It basically means if you take enough it will kill you. Water is toxic, as well as carbon monoxide. It matters to the extent that an ingredient is toxic, and as for fluoride, that is debatable. While there are many studies claiming that fluoride is a neurotoxin, several of them (originating from China) actually studies the effects of fluoride and iodine simultaneously, thus making it significantly harder to separate the results of the test into either those caused by iodine or fluoride.  </p>

<p>Furthermore, all studies on humans (save for <a href="https://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/ehp655/">one which has yet to be successfully replicated</a>) were conducted on a populous that had not been exposed to fluoride in the minute amounts added to drinking water, and were instead based on several groups that used wells that drew from groundwater with incredibly high concentrations of fluoride.  </p>

<p>Even if you can call a fluoride a neurotoxin that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s a good one. The minute amounts found in water do indeed help with cavities and are not meant to subdue you.  </p>

<p>may not be harmful in small amounts but if it&#39;s in the water we drink everyday that adds up.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s the key, it adds up. Fluoride has an accumulative effect on the pineal gland and it is also a neurotoxin. It slows the brains ability to release melatonin, which causes sleeping issues. It makes you tired, unable to rest, have shit REM sleep, and puts your neurotransmitters out of balance, making you feel off, or not as good as you could.</p>

<p>Now add aluminum to the mix. </p>

<p>We&#39;ve got to stop this madness already. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I highly recommend reading the iodine supplementation groups at curezone.com</p>

<p>There is a lot of talk about the pineal gland on this sub, but I had never heard the connection with fluoride.  What I have read is that it does affect the thyroid.  The thyroid picks up elements from the halogen group (fluorine, chlorine, bromine, iodine).  Your body NEEDS iodine.  More on this is found at curezone.com.  But more and more iodine is taken out of our food and supplementation, and instead we are bombarded with fluoride (and also bromides, looking you Mt. Dew).  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I use what is called &quot;Lugol&#39;s&quot;, it&#39;s a formulation of both iodine and potassium iodide (because your body needs both for different reasons).  I start by taking about 6 drops in about 4 oz of water in the morning.  You can get it on Amazon, just search for &quot;iodine&quot;.</p>

<p>Again, I cannot recommend enough to check out the forums at curezone.com.  They are a great source of information on the subject.  </p>

<p>Man as a guy raised in a different country I sometimes feel out of place when chatting with colleagues at work in the US. I can&#39;t describe it well but the young people especially seem to have a need to be some quirky special TV character or something. </p>

<p>I can&#39;t quite put my finger on it but it is easily solved hanging out with other people instead.</p>

<p>So the couple times a day you brush and rinse your teeth it helps a bit.</p>

<p>But it doesn&#39;t all the other times and even when you drink water it doesn&#39;t</p>

<p>Take a drink and probably only the front teeth and top of the molars at most get any contact with water at all.</p>

<p>And when you get a fluoride treatment in the dentist they let it apply for a minute.  Does a split second even do anything?</p>
