        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">198</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2017-11-02 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/FinnagainsAwake.html">FinnagainsAwake</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Orville Almon, the lawyer representing the Route 91 music festival and Jason Aldean, the singer onstage when the Las Vegas shooting began, has been found dead. He was 66.</p>

<p>Almon, a prominent Nashville attorney, opened his private practice Almon Law in 2010 where he represented musicians and entertainment industry organizations during battles with the law.</p>

<p>While his practice included re-negotiating existing agreements and new technology issues, and was renowned for negotiating with law enforcement, recent social media posts suggested the experienced attorney was feeling the strain of his latest high-profile case.</p>

<p>Describing meetings with MGM, Las Vegas police, and the FBI as “incredibly strange and complex” to one of his friends on recently made private Facebook threads, the attorney was privy to inside information that the FBI, by announcing they are no longer holding press conferences and the investigation is closed, have chosen to withhold from the public.</p>

<p>Orville Almon, known as a straight shooting attorney to the many Nashville musicians he represented, has become the latest in a very long line of suspicious deaths and disappearances surrounding the Las Vegas shooting.</p>

<p>Almon’s death, described by local Nashville media as “seizure during sleep”, mirrors that of Kymberley Suchomel of Apple Valley, California, a shooting survivor who was found dead in her home, hours after her husband left for work.</p>

<p>Ms. Suchomel gave a very detailed account of what happened in Las Vegas, insisting there were multiple gunmen involved in the shooting. Claiming that mainstream media was not telling the truth, Kymberley was planning on creating a survivor’s group to continue the quest for truth and justice.</p>

<p>Last week we reported the death of Danny Contreras, another Las Vegas local who had been contradicting the official narrative that only one shooter fired on the Route 91 Harvest festival crowd. Mr. Contreras tweeted the day after the attacks saying he was “lucky to be alive” after he was “chased by two gunmen”.</p>

<p>His tweet was retweeted hundreds of times.</p>

<p>“Feeling lcky to be alive. cant beleive i got out of concert alive! 2 men chasing me with guns. not evry 1 so lcky.”</p>

<p>Dennis and Lorraine Carver, a Las Vegas couple who survived the Las Vegas shooting and were speaking out about the lies being pushed in the official narrative, were engulfed by flames in their car just meters from their home in Las Vegas.</p>

<p>According to the Riverside County Fire Department, the vehicle crashed into a metal gate outside their community at 10:50 p.m. on the 20000 block of Avenida De Arboles. It took firefighters nearly an hour to put out the fire, the Riverside County Fire Department said in an official statement.</p>

<p>In the face of all evidence, and countless survivor testimonies, mainstream media is perpetuating a major cover up by claiming there was only one shooter.</p>

<p>Are these people being silenced to stop the truth coming out?</p>

<p>John Beilman, who was wanted by federal agents following the discovery of a communications device in the hotel room of the officially identified shooter Stephen Paddock, killed both himself and his disabled daughter in an apparent murder-suicide</p>

<p>Chad Nishimura, the Mandalay Bay valet who parked Stephen Paddock’s car, went missing in the days following the shooting, after giving an interview to a Hawaiian mainstream outlet KITV4 in which he contradicted the official narrative, and pointed out that Paddock “didn’t have many bags.” Certainly not enough to cart 27 semi-automatic weapons, thousands of rounds and modifications up to the room.</p>

<p>Whether this series of disturbing deaths and disappearances are purely coincidental or whether there is something deeply sinister afoot has yet to be determined, but the response by law enforcement and mainstream media – in particular their refusal to address the questions that the informed public want answered – is leading many to arrive at the same conclusion.</p>

<p>There is a major cover up underway.</p>

<p>Not saying I don&#39;t believe you, but that&#39;s pretty dismissive without a source.</p>

<p>In fact, I&#39;ll cite this Snopes article: <a href="https://www.snopes.com/chad-nishimura-mandalay-bay-las-vegas/">https://www.snopes.com/chad-nishimura-mandalay-bay-las-vegas/</a></p>

<p>The screenshot provided of the valets facebook account isn&#39;t even the same dude. His last name won&#39;t even fit in the blurred out section of his name in the screencap.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That always incenses me, when people dismiss conspiracy theories because surely there would have to be SO many people in on it and someone would&#39;ve seen something or spoken up. And then you literally show them the masses of videos and social media posts from eye witnesses speaking up, and they get ignored. What people really mean is &#39;If it was true, the MSM would report on it&#39; but the reason they don&#39;t say that is because they know that you can&#39;t claim the MSM is the bastion of truth because it just isn&#39;t. But far too many people secretly believe that it&#39;s just not true unless it&#39;s reported on the evening news.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not finding any big music outlets reporting his death. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here&#39;s his <strong><a href="https://musicrow.com/2017/10/nashville-attorney-orville-almon-jr-dies/">obituary reported by Musicrow.com</a></strong></p>

<p>You can also do a google search for &quot;Orville Almon Obituary&quot; and there are a lot of other links to Dignity Memorial and Legacy.com.</p>

<p>He definitely passed away.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m not finding anything credible tying him to Jason Aldean and/or Route 91. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here is a story from The Argus Leader, which is the daily newspaper of Sioux Falls, South Dakota. The article is from July 19, 2015.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.argusleader.com/story/mattzimmer/2015/07/19/outtakes-with-jed-lance-jason-aldean-lawyer/30362445/">Outtakes with Jed Lance and Jason Aldean&#39;s lawyer</a></strong></p>

<p>The story is mostly about Jed Lance, but the author was also able to speak with Orville Almon - Jason Aldean&#39;s attorney at the time the article was written.  I&#39;m assuming he was still Aldean&#39;s attorney, but I don&#39;t know for sure.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Still, maybe the most entertaining part of working on the story was my interview with Orville Almon, the Nashville entertainment lawyer who acted as a sort of manager/agent for Jed.</p>

<p><strong>Almon is still very much active in the business today, counting Jason Aldean as one of his clients.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wanted to add that I tried searching to see if Almon was the Route 91 Harvest Festival attorney.  </p>

<p>The concert itself wouldn&#39;t have had an attorney.  People filing lawsuits are not going to be filing them against the Route 91 Harvest Festival.  They&#39;d be g them against the Route 92 Harvest Festival.  They&#39;d be filing them against Live Nation - the concert&#39;s promoters.</p>

<p>I did a search and found references to two law firms representing Live Nation in previous cases.  One was Greenberg Traurig LLP and the other was Latham &amp; Watkins.</p>

<p>Orville Almon&#39;s law practice was called Almon &amp; Pike.  I can&#39;t find any links at all between them and Live Nation.</p>

<p>So, Las Vegas is in Clark County, Nevada.  Riverside is in Riverside County, California.  These places are not near each other.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s just shoddy reporting.  I think they were referred to as a Las Vegas couple because they had ties to Henderson, NV.  They lived there part-time.  The rest of the time they lived in Riverside County, CA which is where they were when they were killed.</p>

<p>From Te Las Vegas Review Journal:</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/crime/shootings/couple-with-henderson-ties-die-in-crash-after-surviving-las-vegas-shooting/">Couple with Henderson ties die in crash after surviving Las Vegas shooting</a></strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Two days after the shooting attack, the couple, who lived in Henderson part time and owned a plumbing company, returned to their Riverside County home in California.</p>

<p>[SNIP]</p>

<p>But on the night of Oct. 16, the couple’s younger daughter, 16-year-old Madison Carver, heard a loud bang outside her window. When she ran down the street and rounded the corner, a familiar vehicle engulfed in flames came into view. Dennis, 52, and Lorraine, 53, had died together less than half a mile from their home.</p>

<p>According to the Riverside County Fire Department, their vehicle crashed into a metal gate outside their community at 10:50 p.m. on the <strong>20000 block of Avenida De Arboles.</strong> It took firefighters nearly an hour to completely put out the fire, the department said in a statement.</p>
