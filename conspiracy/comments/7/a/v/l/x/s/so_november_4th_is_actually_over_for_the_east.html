    <div class="md"><p>Nope. Saudi Royals, who own both the mandalay, AND besta pizza did get arrested, though. It was a rough day for the slave tra- pizza industry. Was the protest meant to distract from that, perhaps? Soros funds protest to deflect from the indictments, hoping for civil unrest, yet aside from paid shills, nobody believes the bs.. so here we are, no civil war and podesta&#39;s protectors are in proverbial chains, at the ritz carlton, but cannibalistic, pedophilic, human trafficking murderers, or not, they&#39;re still royalty, amirite?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most of us know that. And I don&#39;t know how many actually believed the civil war shit. I saw for more mocking it. Almost like it was a story crafted just to make conspiracy minded people look stupid. </p>

<p>And sorry if I sound like a dick. I&#39;m just tired of people saying the Nov 4th AntiFa protests were fake news. They&#39;ve planned them for months. They talked about them back in August. </p>

<p>The protests weren&#39;t fake news. The civil war stuff? Only a moron believes a bunch of people, who can&#39;t even figure out if they&#39;re a man or a woman, have any ability at all to start a civil war. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve actually met my local antifa chapter, in my small town of a bit over 1 million. I&#39;m a conservative, so it was me more or less trying to see if there was something real there..</p>

<p>They were actually quite welcoming, turns out the only ones I met were actually just socialists that gathered together from a few local colleges.. they were 8-12 strong, but claimed to have somewhere around 200 local members.</p>

<p>I asked about the antifa groups, and they let me in on the fact that most were fake.. but they convinced me by telling me about their local discord chat, the different ways they encrypt their messages, use VPN, etc.. they basically are so worried that the government has it out for them bring wannabe commies.</p>

<p>They made a big deal about non violence, but this is a legalized marijuana state, so maybe that&#39;s why?</p>

<p>The local alt right is definitely bigger here.. but in either case, it&#39;s mostly a bunch of harmless college kids that barely understand socialism much anything else.. versus a bunch of white dudes that feel like them being white isn&#39;t giving them the privilege they deserve.</p>

<p>Honestly, go to a local college campus and ask around, see if you get different results.. I&#39;m actually curious at this point.</p>

<p>What were the costumes? If it was of a dick and a vagina along with signs saying there&#39;s only two genders.. I&#39;ll laugh. (There&#39;s 3 if you count hermaphrodites)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There weren&#39;t any. The professors wife wrote a letter suggesting that if a student was offended, they should walk away rather than make a scene. Her husband backed her up. The students bullied both them off campus.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Idk, my hypothetical scenario was the idea of two genders (dick+vagina walking around), and they&#39;re saying &quot;don&#39;t be easily triggered&quot;? I&#39;m assuming you&#39;re saying that leftists bullied them, but I&#39;d simply ask &quot;why&quot;?</p>

<p>I mean, I&#39;ll look it up, I&#39;m bored and getting tired.. I just don&#39;t see how regardless of political ideology anyone would give a shit. What was their reason for &quot;bullying&quot;?</p>

<p>My curious point is who is going to stand up on the left in the next 3 years, to try to be the voice that opposes Trump.. I don&#39;t see any strong candidates at this point.. hence, the controlled opposition.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m on the right. But I also don&#39;t look at politics as a team sport. It&#39;s simply liberals hate what I think more than conservatives. I look at each issue each person stands for, and decide who I want to support.</p>

<p>I think maybe it&#39;s because I&#39;m not a sports guy, I don&#39;t see it as I&#39;m winning or losing, because politically, the result <em>should be what matters.</em></p>

<p>Honestly, I didn&#39;t see &quot;politics as a team sport&quot; until Donald started running. People argued points in politics, not simply which side someone is on. As a conservative who&#39;s anti Trump, at least online I feel like a minority.</p>

<p>But we are in a conspiracy sub, I think people are trying to portray the left as being more far left than they actually are.</p>

<p>I think the entire idea of a &quot;culture war&quot; is based on the idea that the majority of the left, or right, all subscribe to a very set kind of ideals.</p>

<p>I think I literally said I&#39;m conservative because liberals will hate my views more than conservatives. I don&#39;t subscribe to either party, I do however think about how what they want, effects me.</p>

<p>I guess my political views align with gender views? I say I&#39;m a helicopter, therefore I am?</p>

<p>No, you can be bisexual, straight.. that doesn&#39;t change your actual gender. My political views can actually be that much more fluid.</p>

<p>That&#39;s sort of the point.. While you&#39;re arguing with people that argue about how many genders there are, based on their sexuality.. I&#39;m saying there&#39;s a politics view that is non binary.</p>

<p>And that&#39;s actually true. You can view politics without subscribing to a team. Period. Full stop. There&#39;s only so many genders, but there&#39;s a full assortment of political views.</p>

<p>If you want to argue for &quot;white genocide&quot;, feel free to do so.. just realize I don&#39;t feel at all oppressed, as an intelligent and educated American.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think people too easily subscribe to the &quot;Soros narrative&quot;. He&#39;s literally a very old white guy who&#39;s probably on his death bed.. he may have money, but I think people overstate a money can actually do, otherwise there simply would have been more people.</p>

<p>What&#39;s your opinion on occupy wall street? People across the nation living in public parks and shit, not for weeks.. but for <em>months</em>!</p>

<p>Were they paid to be there? I mean, I like camping.. but can anyone pay me or anyone else, across the nation, pay people enough to make them give up on all of our nice things for weeks, or <em>months</em>? It wasn&#39;t just NYC, people lived like actual hobos.</p>

<p>That felt like a real movement. Antifa? Nah. Best story I&#39;ve heard is something involving a bike lock. Now, if that was consistently happening, across the country! Then.. okay.</p>

<p>November 4th feels like people with a lot of money trying to make something popular, hoping some nut job actually shows up.. like the Charlottesville guy who killed the fat chick.</p>

<p>My understanding is that the group was actually lead by someone on the left.. purely hoping a nut job showed up, and they did.</p>

<p>If anything, you&#39;ve proven, if we &quot;say something is going to happen&quot; enough, something will happen.. it isn&#39;t true. But you can pay for people to say something is going to happen.. but people like paddock and his maybe accomplices show up when they want, where they want.</p>

<p>You can&#39;t literally pay for extremists. You can pay money to say something is going to happen l  and hope they show up.. but you might just get a nothing burger (and I fucking hate that term).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If she said this last year, long before a book was going to come out, or anytime before then.. you&#39;d have a point. And sure, it makes sense to distance yourself from the dumpster fire that&#39;s <em>also trying to sell books</em>.</p>

<p>My opinion, she intentionally gave the election to Trump. They didn&#39;t even attempt to hide that they stole the nomination.. it&#39;s not condescending that I realize obvious things that you discount. I&#39;m simply pointing out the obvious.</p>

<p>Say she didn&#39;t steal the nomination, or at least made a <em>real effort</em> into hiding the fact that she did.. seriously consider for a second, how many people didn&#39;t vote or voted for Trump because they know she stole the nomination.</p>

<p>People here talk about the deep state and shit, and no one is talking about how easily all this stuff was found out.. all of it leading to Trump being president.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying I&#39;m smarter than you, I am saying I&#39;m smarter than <em>her</em>. There&#39;s tons of ways to communicate that can&#39;t be traced, can&#39;t be hacked.. it&#39;s rather convenient that they didn&#39;t use any of that, even more convenient that we found out long before the election.</p>

<p>And now, to top it all off, there&#39;s two bitches actually trying to <em>turn a profit</em> off of it all. Fuck dude. How fucking obvious does this shit need to be, before someone sees the <em>actual</em> conspiracy that&#39;s staring us all in the face?</p>
