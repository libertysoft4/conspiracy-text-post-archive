<p>I&#39;ve lived and worked in completely different cultures, and in doing so, I had to modify my approach to fit-in and be successful. Normal people don&#39;t do that. The result is chaos. That is what TPTB want. It is not for votes, or stupid shit like that. It is for chaos. That&#39;s the problem, people will react, and the solution will be greater government control.

<p>Some people consume their dead. That doesn&#39;t work in other places. Mixing those groups of peoples would cause civil unrest. Some cultures marry and fuck little kids. Most of our society frowns on that cultural practice. Mix the two together and the shit will hit the fan. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The opposite is true. Humans are naturally drawn to the novel and exotic. Exposure to difference nurtures innovation and versatility. Even on the biological level, genetic diversity increases survivability, homogeneous populations are vulnerable to being wiped out by disease or environmental changes.

    <div class="md"><p>Novel and exotic does mean you want it in your neighborhood 24/7. People fear change, and that is what you are suggesting is normal. It doesn&#39;t work. People have been programed to fear other cultures. Historically, most people tend to only intermingle for economic reasons.</p>

<p>My other and I come from different ethnicities and cultures that speak different languages. I understand first-hand how this genetic mixing creates better proportioned and more attractive features. I enjoy different cultures, but I know that most people do not feel this way.</p>

<p>Multiculturalism is not normal. People will always dislike aspects of other cultures. And, that is OK. If you try and force them together, shit will go down. People should be allowed to intermingle on their own terms. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You say things over and over again, but that doesn&#39;t make them true. History is full of the eager mingling and cross-pollination of not just cultures but the people that make them up. Hell, ancient homo sapiens couldn&#39;t even keep to their own subspecies, that&#39;s why many Europeans and Asians have Neanderthal DNA. That&#39;s why there are smooth transitions between ethnic traits as you travel from Europe through the middle east into Africa. There isn&#39;t a line in the sand somewhere in Turkey where European features stop and Asian ones begin, nor is there one in Egypt where Arabs stop and Africans start. The entire history of humanity is one of people running off and shacking up with someone from the tribe next door. When humans have access to diversity, they take advantage of it. It&#39;s only because the capacity to travel was so limited until the recent present that there was some <em>relative</em> homogeneity in any subregion. The only places we see somewhat clear cultural or ethnic boundaries  are in ones with geographical barriers to intermingling like islands or valleys enclosed by mountains. </p>

<p>You&#39;ve been <em>taught</em> to fear difference, then taught an ideology which rationalizes that fear as natural with ahistorical pseudo-anthropology, and now you&#39;re erroneously projecting on to all people and all history. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I live among difference and like it. I purposefully change what I do on a daily basis for the contrast and to keep mentally sharp. This culture is what rationalizes and promotes fear. I have nothing to do with that. It is not part of my reality. I am, however, not blind to the reality of others.</p>

<p>If you force the mixing of cultures, people will fight. History tells us that. Your idealism doesn&#39;t fit with how people have been brought up. Maybe one day. But, that is not today. Germany is being torn apart from the inside because people are being forced to intermingle with a different culture that is ideologically worlds apart.</p>

<p>Prove you wrong?? Wtf Dude </p>

<p>Implying that people are naturally x is a slippery slope because you&#39;ll have to prove your point in a <em>controlled</em> and not propagated society. </p>

<p>People shunning each other is okay??? to an extent. Privacy doesn&#39;t stop multicuturalism. What you&#39;re doing is saying it while being dismissive of why multiculturalism doesn&#39;t work and that&#39;s racism and intolerance which doesn&#39;t = shunned.</p>

<p>People like you just spout talking points. Whats your end game? Multiculturalism is doom to fail because of people like you. </p>

<p>Multiculturalism will never exist in the flawed paradigm that is currently at play because lol @ safe spaces. </p>

That&#39;s exactly what fascism did, because a monocultural society is easier to control than a multicultural one. You only have to craft one message, one doctrine, one system of propaganda. More cultures = more perspectives and ideas = more potential modes of resistance to totalitarian control. When everyone is the same, the masses are predictable one-size tyranny fits all.

    <div class="md"><p>t isn&#39;t important unless others are capable of respecting each others opinion no matter if they agree or not. I don&#39;t even think we need to focus on diversity. If we stop highlighting the non existent problem then it wouldn&#39;t be a problem.
The mainstream media, hollywood, the educational institutions have intentionally manifested this problem. It is a non issue. Not all of a group of people think the same.People within a group might share some cosmetic (appearance), cultural and cuisine similarities. It doesn&#39;t mean because of the color of their skin they have the same ideological preference. Fundamentally all groups of people want/need similar things. We have a need for food, for shelter, for community. How we operate those things might be different.
I&#39;m a mutt but an American mutt. I have a love for this country and the basic premises it was founded on. I don&#39;t like how it has been shaped with the passage of time.
I don&#39;t think all is lost, I&#39;ve come to appreciate the many different cultural aspects you can find within the United States of America, most people I see in life are just trying to do the right thing. Some of them define what is right into terms in which I can&#39;t agree with, but I understand that they truly believe it is right.
We just need to find a way to be able to understand one another. I don&#39;t think it matters what race you are. If you can&#39;t understand the person you are talking to, can&#39;t understand their perspective then we can&#39;t make a difference. Understanding doesn&#39;t mean agreeing with. It just means you are able to see their position. With proper debate we can enact meaningful change.
Holy crap I&#39;m too high to be spewing out this crap but it felt good.</p>

You can&#39;t let just anyone in, but without multiculturalism you wouldn&#39;t have awesome things like tacos, Chinese food, and anime.

    <div class="md"><p>What you don&#39;t get is that simply putting different kinds of Europeans in one place was a radical form of multiculturalism at that time. Whiteness was a new concept at the time of colonization, prior to its invention the idea of a shared identity between, say, English and French people, would be considered an absurdity. Within the context of the the-limited multicultural experiment, it was indeed wildly successful.</p>

<p>Better still, as America became increasingly multicultural, with black, Arab, Asian, and indigenous people (and women) progressively gaining a voice over the next two centuries, it eventually halted its policies of genocide and slavery and extended the right to vote to all citizens. If you don&#39;t think that&#39;s progress I don&#39;t think there&#39;s much of a conversation to be had. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Divide and conquer, the oldest trick in the book. People are driven by emotions, and the &quot;we should all get along&quot; sentiment taps into thise emotions.</p>

<p>There&#39;s also a massive difference between a 90% homogeneous society with 10% minorities (i.e. most western &quot;multicultural&quot; examples so far) and a 33/33/33 or 50/50 split. For some reason most people think successfully integrating a small minority means that any combination of demographics will work jusy as well. Of course this is not true.</p>

<p>One need only look back through history to see that &quot;true&quot; multiculturalism (i.e. the 50/50 kind) has never once been successful, and most examples of mass migration are accompanied by mass death and suffering. There&#39;s a reason the Brits put the borders where they did in Asia and ME.</p>

<p>We can only conclude that the attempts to force this grand social engineering divide and conquer operation is to incite violence and chaos, and unfortunately there are many useful idiots who are complicit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes they were a disaster, that&#39;s exactly my point. Why were they a disaster? Because they drew the borders to cut through the existing tribes, thus forcing tribal &quot;multiculturalism&quot; on the population m This of course led to violence and chaos, which in turn made it easier to control.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure why you think maintaining a homogeneous society is synonymous with divide and conquer. We&#39;re talking about dividing and conquering nations, which are historically homogeneous. By your logic a no-borders globe would still be divided and conquered because the martians would be excluded.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If your premise is that society in the pre-colonial Indian subcontinent was a multicultural paradise, you couldn&#39;t be further from the truth. It was a tribal society where you were expected to not associate with other tribes let alone other cultures or races. Just because a handful of peoples of different religious faiths weren&#39;t murdering each other at times (often due to imperial decree, i.e. Mughal empire), doesn&#39;t make it a multicultural society in the modern sense.</p>

<p>Even at the most peaceful and &quot;diverse&quot; points, the people living there shared virtually identical genetics and lived in self-segregated areas, based on their tribe. Their society today would be considered worse than pre-civil rights era segregated US.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a huge difference between a Chinese society with a mix of Han, Hui, Manchu, etc. and a modern-day so-called &quot;multicultural&quot; society. Compared to the modern notion of &quot;multiculturalism&quot;, that Chinese society may as well be genetically and culturally homogeneous - and even then they famously never got along. More blood was spilled over ethnic differences in China than any other area pre 20th century. So why again is it a good idea to tempt fate and try forcing together even more divergent populations? If you think it&#39;s a good idea, you are working toward a future of violence and suffering.</p>

<p>Tell me, why do you think the Dalai Lama is against mass Arab migration to Germany? <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3619322/Dalai-Lama-says-Germany-Arab-country-warns-Europe-taken-migrants.html">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3619322/Dalai-Lama-says-Germany-Arab-country-warns-Europe-taken-migrants.html</a></p>

<p>So let&#39;s say we have five starships ready for the mission to colonize five different solar systems many light years away.</p>

<p>How would you populate those starships?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d put an even mix in all five of them. That way when they&#39;re solving the unique challenges on each planet, each ship has a full range of perspectives to draw from. Much better than arriving on a tropical M class planet with vicious fauna and saying &quot;Ah fuck, I wish we had a Klingon to give some advice, but we sent them all to KV-435 which turned out to be an ice planet.&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Glad I could tee that up.</p>

<p>I&#39;m actually quite conservative on many issues. This particular one - racism and antisemitism - is not one of those. As with 4chan, r/conspiracy racial insecurities are pretty constant, divisive, and unproductive.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not. Leftists are mentally ill and don&#39;t understand earning anything, so they think they&#39;re entitled to give away the things of others by installing a victim hierarchy. The left are feminized children who hate daddy, so they do anything to get at daddy. Ergo, victim hierarchies and a way to destroy daddy&#39;s creation.</p>

<p>They&#39;re too retarded to see how it destroys them in the process.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My point it that it is natural for humans to congregate with culturally like-minded individuals, and shun others that don&#39;t fit their mold. This is how the world works, and there is nothing wrong with that.</p>

<p>Some people consume their dead. That doesn&#39;t work in other places. Mixing those groups of peoples would cause civil unrest. Some cultures marry and fuck little kids. Most of our society frowns on that cultural practice. Mix the two together and the shit will hit the fan. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Where are these talking points you keep talking about? Show me. I don&#39;t think they exist. That is why I think you are full of shit.</p>

<p>Yeah, people shun each other all the time. I shun TV watchers. Why? Cause we have nothing in common to talk about. If you try and force me into a room with brainwashed TV watchers, shit will go down fast. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what safe spaces are, but honestly, that sounds like a talking point. No?</p>
