        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Tomorrow night (for me deep South Pacific time zone) appears set to be a doozie no matter if the best laid plans of &quot;mighty&quot; men go off as they envision/predict or if the festering conditions already existing simply continue to their &quot;natural&quot; conclusion and ignite with chaos ensuing.</p>

<p>Who knows.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t but I&#39;m sure glad I ain&#39;t US based esp. in the major seaboard mega cities or any large US cities for that matter. </p>

<p>Yes you could say I&#39;m slightly perturbed to put it lightly as for someone watching from the outside in the recent and current goings on in the US it appears there is a hell of a lot of energy there atm and not all of it feels good..........man ; )</p>

<p>To recap tomorrow night (for me, I&#39;m a day ahead of the US down here in NZ) there is set to be:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>a full moon</p></li>
<li><p>most likely a social engineer/profiteer Soros induced and orchestrated Antifa-esque &quot;Refuse Facism&quot; (LOL) across most major populated city centres in the US that will most likely attract/be attended by the combined plagues of BLM, BAMN, Antifa, Occupy™, SDS, W.I.T.C.H (I can&#39;t believe during the “pizzagate” phenomena these guys weren&#39;t outed/discussed/highlighted/cross referenced given their shall we say questionable symbolism &amp; ideology): </p></li>
</ul>

<p><a href="http://witchpdx.com/">http://witchpdx.com/</a> </p>

<p>and what ever other gang banging, leftist/liberal, disaffected, agitatrix, agent provocateur, antisocial, sociopathic street level hood rat comes out of the sewers to revel in the potential chaos. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>the ongoing tension and negative energy derived from and brought to bear on the social consciousness from the political shakedowns that appear (to the normie [pre]Occupied™ mind) teetering between who&#39;s really getting exposed for &quot;colluding with the Russians&quot; is it the Dems.? or is it Trump (as most of them think)?</p></li>
<li><p>the ongoing tension and negative energy derived from and brought to bear on the social consciousness by the hollywood pedo/sexual misconduct/assault shakedowns that no one really appears to be suffering any significant consequences as a result of</p></li>
<li><p>the ongoing, historic culture wars that have been intensely magnified since the 2016/17 election period and escalated constantly by major battles &amp; myriad minor skirmishes ever since building the narratives of both the &quot;alt-right&quot; and &quot;antifa&quot; to near hysterical proportions, the spectre of full blown civil or race war, unending MSM sensational coverage of these issues and the shifting sands of what is actually/discernibly agit. prop., psy-op, controlled opposition, agent provocateurs, dis/mis-info or real and the tie in to the goals of inverted totalitarianism one being fatigue of the social consciousness and the resulting apathy, cynicism, learned helplessness and a reduction of meaningful participation in and indeed expectation that the participatory, democratic political process can any longer achieve meaningful change</p></li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverted_totalitarianism">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverted_totalitarianism</a></p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learned_helplessness">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learned_helplessness</a></p>

<ul>
<li><p>the govt. planned EMP readiness/response drills and their actual purpose and significance</p></li>
<li><p>previous predicted events such as 1999/2000 Y2K, 2012, this year’s Sept. 26th astrological alignment, the always impending swamp draining and ongoing incremental and mega LARPs and the always present yearning anticipation or morbid dread of a general clock cleaning, slate wiping, impending doom, apocalyptic conditioned response scenario</p></li>
<li><p>the themes of some of the fights in arguably the &quot;card of the year/all time&quot; (it always is) UFC 217 (2017?) - Michael &quot;The Count&quot; Bisping Vs. George &quot;Rush&quot; St Pierre with the fleur de lis tattoo perhaps signifying/recalling/channelling (for what reason/relevance/end I&#39;m not sure) one of the modern worlds oldest hostilities that being the ages old animosity between the nations of France and Britain, the final reckoning between former &quot;brothers in arms&quot; and now bitter rivals Cody Garbrandt Vs. TJ Dillashaw, Rose Namajunas Vs.  Joanna Jędrzejczyk as it turns out are both originally from the bordering European countries Lithuania &amp; Poland for what it&#39;s worth although Rose appears to have grown up in the US most of her life, Stephen Thompson vs. Jorge Masvidal, Johny Hendricks vs. Paulo Borrachinha, Walt Harris vs. Mark Godbeer and Randy Brown vs. Mickey Gall could all be construed to be fights that potentially highlight and play on tensions between &quot;white/majority&quot; culture and &quot;Latino/black/minority&quot; cultures - all of this concerning the UFC only being included due to it&#39;s potential to primitively stir the fight/flight reaction in the average casual Tap Out/&quot;just bleed&quot; fan on a seriously primed &amp; ready weekend of potential chaos as it is with the card set to play out in MSG the city having, already this week prior, been the scene of highly contentious and culture war fanning &quot;terrorist attack&quot; due to what appears to be, amongst many things, lax vetting on familial repatriation/invitations and of course absent FBI monitoring as is default/to be expected. 
Additionally you just don&#39;t know what some of the fighters and the symbolism surrounding them represents to different tiers/ factions or members of society let alone the revenue that stands to be gained from the bets placed on the outcomes. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>All in all the themes briefly covered above all appear to have in common either negative tension between perceived opposites locked in long term narrative struggles which have really picked up pace and intensity over the past couple of years or are simply added negative pressure in the form of potential world ending and disastrous outcomes in the case of the EMP drills and what they allude to.</p>

<p>So put on your (tinfoil) thinking caps, stick it in your pipes, pull out your autist interface devices and discuss!</p>

<p>To all my State side r/conspiracy brethren - take care tomorrow, look out for your fellow man, don&#39;t get drawn into the theater of the absurd that is the divisive and controlling micro narratives compounded upon micro narratives compounded upon micro narratives until macro rage is achieved, lkeep your wits about you, trust your intuitions and stay safe.</p>

<p>It has the potential to be a glorious historic moment in US history too which would be some good news for the US and hopefully excise the rot so that things can genuinely grow better there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;I trane UFC&quot; is an admittedly silly but funny in joke/meme from r/MMA.</p>

<p>It pokes fun at the stereotypical macho meat head MMA fans shallow mindedness and desire to be associated with the UFC/MMA. </p>

<p>I&#39;m glad you own several fire arms.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure there are people out there that own RPGs and tanks. Your point being?</p>

<p>I&#39;m also glad you cam here to comment &quot;nobody watches ufc&quot; and that was the take away you got from my post. Good work.</p>

<p>Clearly a lot of people do watch the UFC as they make squillions on their gates and PPVs, many of their athletes are household names and they have major sponsorship deals with among other corps. reebok, budweiser, monster energy drink and the USMC to name some.</p>

<p>I think what you mean is you and your circle don&#39;t watch UFC. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s good to hear guys. </p>

<p>I realize after writing this list of portents of potential doom that there are many, many, well adjusted, peaceful Americans who will simply wake up and get on with their lives and enjoy a nice weekend. </p>

<p>I just wanted to list the uncanny, or is it even really in such a large country, convergence of seemingly unrelated things said to be happening within the same time frame. I think the more fluid and destabilized major cities will, I assume/speculate, like usual experience the brunt of the disharmony and potential chaos, rioting and general gnashing of teeth.</p>

<p>Hope y&#39;all keep a weather eye out and tools at hand ; ) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I did not recognize your reference to Inverted Totalitarianism. Thanks for that pointer. I should have known about Wolin before now:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A consummate reader of texts, he carefully combined attention to both the intellectual and political contexts in which an author intervened and the genres of writing he deployed, with an eye to understanding how a particular body of work shed light on a specific political predicament. (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheldon_Wolin">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheldon_Wolin</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Intervene? Sure wish I could intervene some days...</p>

<p>But I also didn&#39;t know right off what the UFC was, and I still do not understand why it warrants the level of analysis you give it, unless you are presupposing a direct link between UFC and antifa-related street fighters, or between UFC and some psychological pre-disposition for modern fight fans to channel historical conflicts, perhaps as a form of epigenetic exposure therapy.</p>

<p>My mild autism is showing...</p>
