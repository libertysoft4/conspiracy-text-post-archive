<p>I took it the same way, but I see it as appeal to authority, and a bad one at that, or source snobbery.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>shaun king is fake black guy who was pushing the black lives matter thing to divide and conquer but I think at some point he woke up and realized Hillary was no good, he was on to this money laundering scam a year ago:</p>

<p>It appears to be a money laundering scheme. Do you remember when George Clooney said that Bernie Sanders and his supporters were right to be disgusted by the fact that some seats at the fundraiser cost $353,400 per couple, but that he could live with it because the money was mainly going to help smaller candidates win local elections?</p>

<p>He was wrong.</p>

<p>And let&#39;s be real about this, too: nobody&#39;s spending that much <em>only</em> to attend a dinner. This is like saying that Russian banks were spending $500k <em>only</em> for a speech from Bill Clinton. This is pay-to-play or straight up money laundering. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was a fund-raising dinner and that&#39;s how they work.<br/>
Nothing is untoward about the price on its surface.<br/>
The money was even distributed according campaign finance law.</p>

<p>Where this becomes a crime is where they side-stepped campaign finance law and funneled the $10k state donations to the national party and then moved the money to Hillary&#39;s campaign.</p>

Everyone knows that was the most rigged &quot;investigation&quot; to ever happen, a complete embarrassment to investigations! She had dirt on puppets, DESTROYED all her devices (is that not an admition of guilt?). Trump&#39;s been slowly dismantling the whole scummy system built and maintained by Bush/Obama/Clinton and they&#39;re losing all support.

    <div class="md"><p>If that&#39;s your evidence destroyed evidence then Trump is a rapist I would agree and honestly they can all burn for all I care I vote Democrat for many reasons but if you actually think after hearing Trump admit to grabbing women by the pussies and kissing them without asking ! That&#39;s sexual assault! Not to mention Trump is one of the only presidents not to show his tax returns that&#39;s not guilty to you? He is a con man and if he opened them up he would be in jail too! Money laundering is absolutely going on in his family for years ! He&#39;s a draft dogging bitch but talks about military so often it&#39;s sickening! He&#39;s just good at talking to his stupid redneck military base ! But if they actually knew him they would realize he&#39;s a spoon fed rich boy and has made a living fucking people over and being an asshole his entire life he could die today and this world would cheer !! You would see rejoice in the streets ! Never has there been a more hated president EVER! how can you stand listening to him speak .Huge , believe me &quot; his face is very punchable.do me a favor do some research on Trump&#39;s corruption and not just Hillary ! That&#39;s the difference if Hillary was proven to be a real criminal not just from brietbart or Alex crazy Jones ! Then I&#39;d be happy to see her ass thrown in jail because that&#39;s a REAL American but you trumptards can&#39;t even admit a guy with like 15 sexual assault cases you guys just say o there all fake or any REAL evidence coming forward about his corruption you guys say fake news bla bla bla it&#39;s not a fucking team it&#39;s real life ! I used to here idiots like you defending bush back in the day too! Saying he&#39;s keeping Americans safe ! Lol neocon Republicans are the most evil group ever in politcs ! </p>

<p>r/news also had a blackout on Podesta, but does permit negative Trump articles.  So much for a neutral default sub.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I made this point in the thread that WAS on the top page of reddit about trump pulling us out of the international push to reveal revenues from big oil. Yeah lets sensationalize an article about Trump doing something marginally bad and not put anything throwing shit at HRC on the front page. Its literally just blatant now, just like during the election when politics LITERALLY was 95% Trump smear articles and then like one post about something really shitty HRC did that is article downplaying whatever she did. Its insane, we live in the fucking twilight zone dude. </p>

<p>Like HRC was just confirmed to have rigged the primary in her favor with that deal, and was caught lying red handed about &quot;not knowing&quot; about the dossier only to come out this week and say yeah well heres why its ok that I did that. In which she paid for the research on the RUSSIAN dossier obtained by a British Intelligence officer who used to work in RUSSIA. Any neither of these things are on the front page, probably the 2 biggest confirmed cases of election fraud in history. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hot take: I hope they keep doing this. Keep trying to bury the mess that is the dem party so that shit hits the fan during the 2018 election cycle--or better yet hide it until 2020! Remember when all they could talk about was how the RNC convention was going to be a civil war between trump and cruz/establishment and the DNC convention was going to be a celebration? How did that turn out? Oh right the republican establishment fell in line and the dems had to use white noise machines to drown out the booing from the 40% sanders delegates who were ultimately kicked out where they joined the OWS progressives protesting outside.</p>

<p>Conservatives are all on the same page whereas liberals have built a house of cards that has to eventually collapse. Identity politics dominate the left to the point where they are openly sexist towards men, openly racist towards whites, openly hateful towards christians, and openly heterophobic towards straights. And unlike the republicans who have long-since put their kkk/nazis in their place, the left&#39;s bigots are squarely in the limelight. They&#39;re not just the face of the democrat party but the future if you look at the moves they&#39;ve been making since 11/2016. The left is doubling down on hateful rhetoric and identity politics, and the only way they can possibly win going forward (since they don&#39;t want to admit fault, have an introspection, and change their ways) is to try to convince everyone that right wing extremism is the only type of extremism that exists.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t wait to see their 2020 primary when you have a black panther candidate, an lgbt candidate, and a feminazi candidate trying to argue about who has the most oppression points. I said it before and I&#39;ll say it again; the next fascist leader will almost certainly come from the most protected class.</p>

<p>The right has issues.... the establishment hacks are still trying to mitigate &#39;trumpism&#39; at every step. (IE corker, flake, McCain, Bush, etc)</p>

<p>That said... the right have lost trust in the political system.... almost entirely. They primaried trump to spite the RNC.  Then they voted him into the whitehouse to spite the crazy leftists, the corporate media and the corporations who back the establishment.  </p>

<p>Yeah, the right-wing subreddits definitely aren&#39;t quick to dole out bans and censor dissent. People get banned from THIS sub for mentioning that it&#39;s biased for Trump.</p>

<p>Look at this subreddit right now. Trump administration and campaign officials have been indicted in a corruption investigation. One of them has probably been wearing a wire for the last several months. Zero threads. But, hey, plenty of threads about the DNC.</p>

<p>More over, it is anything against the Democrasts/left wing ideology. They do not want any truth getting out.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>None of the right-wing subreddits are discussing the corruption investigations. So we can say they don&#39;t want any truth getting out, right?</p>

<p>You&#39;re just regurgitating right-wing talking points. Think for yourself. ShareBlue isn&#39;t the only propaganda machine out there. A mention Cambridge Analytica was notably absent from your post- probably because it&#39;s a right-wing astroturfing campaign?</p>

<p>No. But, <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> was very, very strong with hate for Hillary. Immediately following the DNC, nothing negative was visible for Hillary.

<p>I&#39;m sorry to tell you, but they make it very clear in the rules. Conspiracy will not ban you for addressing anything Trump in here. Now if you violate rule 10 in your rant, yes, you can get banned. Bashing the sub or users is not allowed here. No matter he candidate. Don&#39;t pretend it is only about Trump. </p>

<p><a href="/r/Politics">/r/Politics</a> on the other hand is quick to censor anything pro Trump/anti Hillary or DNC. Hell, I was banned from <a href="/r/streetfights">/r/streetfights</a> because I subscribe at T_D. Also banned from <a href="/r/washingtonDC">/r/washingtonDC</a> for the same. And if someone checks your post history and finds you post in T_D, you are bashed for that and your points are ignored. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Ugh, yes they are. This Russia nonsense has been brought up here over and over again. Let me break it down for you why discussion has become so sparse on this topic: </p>

<ol>
<li>You&#39;re ignoring context that informs most people interested in the &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; community. So what&#39;s the relevant context here? Though you&#39;re in r/conspiracy subreddit, you&#39;ve apparently never picked up on the widespread skepticism of the CIA, FBI, and NSA. Allegations that are coming from sources within US intelligence will be subject to this skepticism. I won&#39;t go into all the examples that justify that skepticism here, but there is good reason to believe that US media getting these &quot;scoops&quot; is not an accident or an example of good investigative journalism, but rather a deliberate attempt to manipulate the public through the media (c.f. Operation Mockingbird). Furthermore, many here, though not all, believe that the top-level conspiracy is to bring about a NWO. There may be some disagreement about who the ultimate puppet masters are (Illuminati, Jews, the Pope, etc.), but there is not much disagreement that this conspiracy is not guided by benign motives. In that context, the attempt to portray Trump&#39;s relations with Russia as sinister, whether those relations are real or not, looks a lot like propaganda. Trump and Russia are commonly regarded as enemies of the NWO. That may or may not be true in the end, but at this stage it seems likely that their opposition is genuine. This is relevant because we would have to be naive to think that a person who has frustrated the ambitions of a (if not the) global elite would not come in for some retaliatory attempts to discredit him.</li>
<li>Another specific and significant reason to be skeptical of this and stories like it is that there have been so many stories about Russia recently that have turned out to be false. It really starts to look like a pattern of lies, even to ordinary people who are oblivious of the motives of TPTB. Here are several recent examples:
<a href="https://theintercept.com/2016/12/31/russia-hysteria-infects-washpost-again-false-story-about-hacking-u-s-electric-grid/">https://theintercept.com/2016/12/31/russia-hysteria-infects-washpost-again-false-story-about-hacking-u-s-electric-grid/</a>
<a href="https://theintercept.com/2016/12/14/heres-the-public-evidence-russia-hacked-the-dnc-its-not-enough/">https://theintercept.com/2016/12/14/heres-the-public-evidence-russia-hacked-the-dnc-its-not-enough/</a>
<a href="https://theintercept.com/2016/11/26/washington-post-disgracefully-promotes-a-mccarthyite-blacklist-from-a-new-hidden-and-very-shady-group/">https://theintercept.com/2016/11/26/washington-post-disgracefully-promotes-a-mccarthyite-blacklist-from-a-new-hidden-and-very-shady-group/</a>
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/11/01/that-secret-trump-russia-email-server-link-is-likely-neither-secret-nor-a-trump-russia-link/?utm_term=.7a28900fb717">https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/11/01/that-secret-trump-russia-email-server-link-is-likely-neither-secret-nor-a-trump-russia-link/?utm_term=.7a28900fb717</a> (The fact that even the Washington Post disavowed the story should tell you something)</li>
<li>Another specific reason to suspect that these attacks are highly motivated disinformation meant to discredit Trump and raise fears about Russia is the events in Syria. As I&#39;ve discussed many times before in this sub—since it&#39;s an area of particular concern to me—the US ran a CIA led campaign in Syria to topple Assad. Among this project&#39;s objectives was that of securing the route for the Saudi-Qatar pipeline into Europe. The US is complicit in arming ISIS and Al Qaeda to bring about this objective. For that reason and many others, to be explicit, the US are not the &quot;good guys&quot; in this scenario. The relevant point here is that Russia has now thwarted that plan by stepping in for Assad. So do you think that the powers behind that objective will just passively accept this result, or do you think they will use every dirty trick they can to seize back the reins? This explains why anti-Russian propaganda, which has been going on for years, has reached a peak recently.
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5itgwp/the_obama_administrations_role_in_the_overthrow/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5itgwp/the_obama_administrations_role_in_the_overthrow/</a></li>
<li>Another important point is that a lot of these reports, and the reddit &quot;dossiers&quot; of evidence linking Trump to Russia are based on the assumption that such relations are sinister. But to be clear, I want the US to establish peaceful relations with Russia. Americans happily swallow propaganda showing the Russians, and Putin in particular, as aggressive, murderous, and scheming. And it is propaganda: any country can be shown to be sinister if certain facts are given the spotlight and others hidden. Americans who happily indulge in negative Russian stereotypes should be more judicious and realize that the US has more than enough sins of its own that could be spun the same way. The main point here is that conflict with Russia is neither inevitable nor desirable, so if members of Trump&#39;s team are contacting Russia to facilitate better relations, why would I be bothered by that? Yes, the allegations about the Rosneft deal would be damning, but that is not substantiated. These reports are spinning mere contact as sinister, and that is fucked up. Here is a comment I made in response to some of these issues recently for context:
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/5roev7/donald_trump_lifts_sanctions_on_russia_that_were/dd9ifc7/">https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/5roev7/donald_trump_lifts_sanctions_on_russia_that_were/dd9ifc7/</a></li>
<li>Finally, none of these arguments necessarily imply support for Trump! There are specific policies of Trump&#39;s that I agree with, but many that I don&#39;t agree with. Also, I don&#39;t find his personal ability or character particularly suitable in a leader. However, in terms of conspiracy, these 2-dimensional political policies and personal qualities are secondary. While I&#39;m not sure exactly what Trump represents, and while he clearly does have links to some part of the establishment, he clearly does represent some kind of change. I am ambivalent as of now about whether that change is for the better, but I&#39;m not naive enough to think that the establishment that he&#39;s replacing was in any way more ethical or less sinister than Trump is currently portrayed to be. The forces that he has displaced and whose interests he is frustrating are pushing this anti-Russian narrative hard.
For these reasons, I am skeptical of these allegations. </li>

<p>Dude, think about this critically. It&#39;s been established that reddit is full of liberals. <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> was all pro-Bernie. Bernie gets knocked out.

<p>Holy shit. Just wow. You just start right off and acknowledge the reason for the bias in this sub. I was going to respond to all your points but I don&#39;t need to go further than this. You&#39;ve broke it down for me. Trump is regarded as an enemy of the NWO and, as such, gets the benefit of the doubt. Skepticism regarding federal investigative agencies arises when Trump is the focal point, but everyone in this sub is drooling at the chance for one of those agencies to target DNC or Hillary. Trump-Russia conspiracies are a huge nothingburger, but Clinton&#39;s involvement with the Russian uranium &quot;scandal&quot; is a massive deal. Real news regarding the indictments has been occurring every day and the front page is flooded with posts about the DNC. </p>

<p>Hi! That&#39;s me. 100% liberal beliefs. My support stops at the most corrupt politician the world has ever seen. it also stopped at Obama after his first year. </p>

<p>I would expect Reddit to have a community of intelligent, like minded people capable of research critical thought and analysis.  I would expect the hillary bashers to continue bashing her. It&#39;s like saying redskins fans were upset that redskins got put out of the playoffs, so they now cheer for and like their arch enemy team rival that made it. </p>

<p>it makes no sense in my mind. How can you morally, ethically, politically go from bitching day in and day out about how corrupt a politician is, then turn a blind eye and 100% support them. </p>

<p>Hold on man. It is a fact hillary hired a group to delete emails from her server after a subpoena was issued. It is also a fact she had black berries smashed with hammers. That is clearly violations of law. Why has she not been convicted? That is why they call it corruption my friend.

<p>Like I gave credit, those were  <a href="/u/soberreflection">/u/soberreflection</a> words. Now I agree with him, but don&#39;t act like you know me like that. </p>

<p>I voted for Obama in 08. i voted for Hillary in the 08 primaries. i gave to both candidates in 08. After Oabam&#39;s 1st year, it was clear he was corrupt, and I abandoned him. I will do the same with Trump. </p>

<p>But what i see happening right now is a total all out media frenzy attack on Trump. David Brocke received several million to make sure Trump gets impeached. He has been wire taped, bugged, followed, surveilance, and over 10M has been poured into finding dirt on him and the best they came up with was &quot;Grab em by the pussy.&quot; </p>

<p>Until I see somethingof substance, I&#39;m sorry, but I&#39;m simply not listening to CNN. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Open your eyes. Trump made his money selling goods and services. Clinton&#39;s made their money selling our Government. I don&#39;t bite into partisan politics. I&#39;m a 100% conspiracy theorist. </p>

<p>Both sides are the same. They create division in the US populace using wedge issues that do not amount to a hill of beans. Obama just continued Bush era policies. They get along great. They are pals. But no one in politics seems to like Trump. I wonder why? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The real conspiracy in American politics right now is widescale collusion with Russia. Anyone who engaged in quid pro quo activity with Russian officials or representatives (private or public parties) should face investigation, and potentially indictment.</p>

<p>Anyone who believes in conspiracy theories should pay attention to the <em>actual conspiracy in front of us</em> and quit trying to spin the investigation on the conspiracy as the conspiracy itself. It&#39;s conspiracy-ception at that point, and it&#39;s stupid.</p>

<p>As for the other half of the conspiracy: anyone who doesn&#39;t recognize that Russia is playing both sides against the middle is, again, ignoring the actual conspiracy right in front of us. Bernie subs, politics, news, etc. All of these subs are being targeted and used by bots and trolls to create chaos.</p>

<p>So yeah, anyone out there that&#39;s pro-Trump and believes in actually conspiracies needs to recognize that their candidate did something illegal or at best very unethical, and then simultaneously come to the objective realization that we are <em>all</em> being played by an opportunistic dictator named Vladimir Putin.</p>

I know <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is not exactly a leftist sub but I&#39;m surprised by the ignorance people here have about what&#39;s going on with the Democratic Party.  Groups like Justice Democrats, Our Revolution, Brand New Congress, and to some extent the Democratic Socialists of America have made reforming the Democratic Party a major goal, and they are definitely paying attention to the DNC.  The DNC chair campaign, where Tom Perez was pushed in by the Obama team to prevent Keith Ellison from winning, was just one example of the ongoing conflict between the left and the center/right wings of the Democratic Party.  As is the recent purge of Bernie supporters from the Rules Committee of the DNC.</p>

<p>If you mean &quot;most of the left,&quot; you mean most of the American population who tend to vote for Democrats, then sure, most people in general don&#39;t care about this shit.  If you&#39;re talking about activists and politically opinionated people, the story is very different.</p>

<p>Vote fuzzing is only a small part, the big change is they changed from a &quot;net upvotes&quot; model to an algorithm calculated &quot;score&quot;. For bigger posts the score can be wildly different than the net number of upvotes. There is proof of how wildly inaccurate estimating number of votes from score here: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Enhancement/comments/5wjlfy/suggestion_remove_total_vote_count_as_its_wildly/">https://www.reddit.com/r/Enhancement/comments/5wjlfy/suggestion_remove_total_vote_count_as_its_wildly/</a>, the closer to 50% a post is the higher the error. In that linked post I link to an admin comment confirming a post had less than 50k total votes, but the number given by res was 900k, way, way off.</p>

<p>Nonsense. Getting a middling response and not making it to the front page isn&#39;t the same as not being down voted into negative karma, and they reflect very different processes.  Search &quot;Mueller&quot; by new and there&#39;s not a single article at 0 in the first 25 results, and that includes duplicate stories.

<p>I don’t think questioning the DNC is inconsistent with the subs typical readership at all. The phenomenon you are describing happens on all the big subreddits. People lurk /new/ and their voting patterns tend to guide which articles get a foothold in the voting. That doesn’t mean topics are censored by TPTB or there is a conspiracy to hide information from the masses. You can go to /politics/new/ right now and there will be dozens of articles on thensqme topic, some with zero karma and some with hundreds. It’s not vote fixing, it’s just the complex machinations of the hive mind and an illustration of the theory behind Reddit. </p>

<p>No, it&#39;s not, which is exactly my point.  It is consistent with it, which is why it&#39;s abnormal that the vast majority of stories critical of the DNC are disproportionately downvoted into negative karma when compared with stories about other subjects.</p>

<p>You are obviously determined to chalk these blatant detectable voting patterns up to &quot;complex machinations of the hive mind&quot; but the more obvious and likely explanation is astroturfing by organizations such as Shareblue that have <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/337535680/Full-David-Brock-Confidential-Memo-On-Fighting-Trump#from_embed">openly announced their intentions</a> to use thousands of paid employees to influence narratives on social media.</p>

<p>Sometimes when something seems obvious, it&#39;s true.  Why <em>wouldn&#39;t</em> they try to manipulate the story?  It&#39;s not shocking or outlandish.  This kind of thing happens <a href="https://thenextweb.com/evergreen/2017/07/11/astroturfing-reddit-is-the-future-of-political-campaigning/">all the time</a>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well again, it&#39;s not <em>censorship,</em> so it&#39;s not like these stories are never seen at all.  But there are definitely external forces trying to influence <em>how much</em> certain stories are seen and discussed, and it seems likely that could have a corrosive effect on the casual reader&#39;s perception of the relative importance of events.  ie, thinking that Russian oppo research is a more pressing issue than a Democratic Party establishment that is completely opposed to the notion of class struggle.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A memo obtained by NBC News details the way in which the Democratic National Committee struck a deal with Hillary Clinton in 2015 that gave her campaign input on some party hiring and spending decisions. <strong>According to the memo, it related only to preparations for the general election and also left the door open for other candidates to make similar arrangements. The document provides additional context to claims made by former interim chairwoman Donna Brazile, which sent the party into a tailspin this week.</strong></p>

<p>Are you referring to this - &quot;The Sanders&#39; campaign later signed its own joint fundraising agreement with the DNC, but did not utilize it.&quot;  That&#39;s a different agreement, with different terms, AKA not giving the Sanders campaign control over staffing, strategy and finance before the primaries ended.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not that complicated. We aren&#39;t upset that there <em>was</em> an agreement, we&#39;re upset over the <em>terms</em> of the agreement.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>In a letter to DNC members, Chairman Tom Perez noted that the party reached joint fundraising agreements with both Clinton and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. &quot;The joint fundraising agreements were the same for each campaign except for the treasurer, and our understanding was that the DNC offered all of the presidential campaigns the opportunity to set up a [joint fundraising agreement] and work with the DNC to coordinate on how those funds were used to best prepare for the general election.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>That may be true — but two Democratic officials tell NPR that Brazile and Perez are referring to two different things. In addition to that joint fundraising agreement the DNC reached with both campaigns, the party and the Clinton campaign struck that separate memorandum of understanding giving the campaign staffing and policy oversight.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The separate deal they&#39;re talking about?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That document was signed on Aug. 26, 2015 — before, among other things, Vice President Joe Biden ruled out a run for president.</p>

<p>The DNC has not denied this characterization or timeline.</p>

<p>A Democratic official who has reviewed the document pointed out that in addition to the Clinton signoffs Brazile characterized, it included language stating that &quot;nothing in this agreement shall be construed to violate the DNC&#39;s obligation of impartiality and neutrality through the Nominating process&quot; and that &quot;all activities performed under this agreement will be focused exclusively on preparations for the General Election and not the Democratic Primary.&quot;</p>

<p>The agreement also noted that the DNC &quot;may enter into similar agreements with other candidates.&quot; (Read the full memo below.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, you should&#39;ve linked to that article in the first place, because it had information about the agreement in question that wasn&#39;t included in your other link.</p>

<p>After reading through the agreement, it seems to be self contradictory and somewhat vague. I mean it starts out at the very beginning with this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;HFA&#39;s obligations under this agreement, and the release of the Base Amounts each month are conditioned on the following:</p>

<p>With respect to the hiring of a DNC Communications Director, <strong>the DNC agrees that no later than September 11, 2015 it will hire one of two candidates previously identified as acceptable to HFA</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which is obviously giving HFA control over the DNC before the primaries are over.  And then it goes on to list the things Donna described, but it does end in the caveat that everything in the agreement is intended for &quot;preparations for the general.&quot;  The only way for that not to be a contradiction is if the meaning of &quot;preparations&quot; extends all the way back to September 2015.  Also of note is that no one in the DNC has actually denied that Hillary&#39;s campaign <em>was</em> given the authority that Donna listed. All anyone has done is point to that specific contradictory wording within the agreement, like &quot;we couldn&#39;t have done that, we said we wouldn&#39;t.&quot; </p>

<p>So you&#39;re right, this definitely is an important consideration, and I guess we end up in a he said she said situation. But everything I just said, along with what was revealed about the DNC&#39;s obvious favoritism during the primaries, leads me to believe that Donna&#39;s interpretation of the agreement is probably what was actually acted on, and that the caveat about the general election was effectively meaningless.  But who knows. </p>

<p>The agreement—signed by Amy Dacey, the former CEO of the DNC, and Robby Mook with a copy to Marc Elias—specified that in exchange for raising money and investing in the DNC, Hillary would control the party’s finances, strategy, and all the money raised. Her campaign had the right of refusal of who would be the party communications director, and it would make final decisions on all the other staff. The DNC also was required to consult with the campaign about all other staffing, budgeting, data, analytics, and mailings.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve followed this sub for a long while, you didn&#39;t see that so much until r/the_dumbass started thinking they fit in here. Multiple posts about people claiming censorship by r/news &quot;they won&#39;t let my anti Hillary post stay up!&quot; When it clearly has already been posted, or it&#39;s a source that isn&#39;t allowed, etc.</p>

<p>I really hate how many posts that are clearly just political in nature (no conspiracy, almost always right leaning) are left to stay up here. I come here to get away from the drama of r/politics and news..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it has a lot to do with the fact that theres much more pressing and interesting things happening at the same time with a party in power.

<p>This issue will have to be addressed, but I understand the urge to not let this muddy the waters in regards to the perception of the corruption facing the actual president. </p>

<p>There&#39;s just too much going on and people are getting scandal fatigue to the point that people feel that nothing matters anymore and there&#39;s nothing we can do because everything is shit.

    <div class="md"><p>I think the desire to sweep it under the rug goes beyond what you&#39;re saying.</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s easy to hate Republicans because we are postured to think that their policies have short term gains for the rich and long term detriments to the middle and lower class. In truth, true conservatism follows the principle of trickle down economics is that the more capital they have not being paid out to mandatory expenses, the more they can invest in themselves, their employees, their businesses, thus creating cash surplus, increasing the consumer spending index, and facilitating economic growth.</p>

<p>It is completely disingenious and biased to not hold the DNC to the same type of investigation and to hold Hillary and her campaign responsible for what they&#39;ve done. They are just as much at fault for what we are going through as Donald Trump is. If she and her campaign did not disenfranchise American voters, we would likely have a new president and none of this would even be happening right now.</p>

<p>She needs to be tried.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s talk about how the bull got into the shop in the first place. We had a swarm of sheep bicker over whether it should be the sheep or the lamb, and the bull exploited their quarrel and snuck past security during the fray. Noticing this, the sheep drops a banana peel underneath the leg of the lamb (lol) and lies to everyone who supported the lamb, despite the fact that more people preferred the lamb to begin with. Which left the bull to destroy the significantly weaker sheep and then take control of the entire store.</p>

<p>Analogies aside, Hillary duped Bernie and his supporters. If she ran a fair campaign, she still wouldn&#39;t have been the president, but qualified officials on the subject say that neither would Donald Trump. Just because you&#39;re partial to Hillary and her politics doesn&#39;t make her any less divisive. Her book is bullshit, and she fucked over America and is a significant part of why we are living in Trumpland. She needs to be help accountable, it&#39;s not like there&#39;s a shortage of political lawyers waiting to take her down.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you being serious? Really? REALLY?? Wake up. It doesn&#39;t matter if you used to believe in those people, I used to, but I was honest enough with myself to see what they really were and what was actually going on. Trump is no angel, of course, but the thing is - EVERYBODY who is anybody pretty much in DC, in the media etc, are going after Trump, they are investigating him, if he is corrupt, if he&#39;s done something wrong, we will definitely find out about it and he will face justice.</p>

<p>The difference, and this is what so many fail to see, is that EVERYBODY pretty much is on the other hand COVERING UP for Clinton et al. The media, people in law enforcement, the DNC etc, have been covering up for Clinton for what appears to be a very long time. Social media is rigged in their favor, the MSM for the most part chooses to ignore revelations about Clinton and the DNC that it would be screeching about were they about Trump instead.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why people push the Clinton crimes on subs like this, because if we don&#39;t, no one will. Trump corruption is more than covered by TPTB. Clinton corruption is not, and that is a massive problem for justice and democracy and national security and everything that the US supposedly stands for.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t be that person who allows their cognitive dissonance to direct them into being a completely amoral human being. The DNC is not your family, Hillary Clinton is not your Mom-it&#39;s okay if you acknowledge that they have broken the law, that they are as corrupt as the universe is large. They duped you, they duped a hell of a lot of people. The only shame is in NOT admitting that, and being part of the crowd that tried to help them get away with it (and failed, btw).</p>

<p>Never said you were, I said it seems dumb to make fun of conspiracy theorists like they&#39;re crazy for jumping at shadows (this thread) when there was an actual real live conspiracy just exposed, which goes to show that conspiracies actually do happen.

    <div class="md"><p>Unsurprisingly, this pair of comments I made on r/Political_Revolution (not r/Politics mind you, I don&#39;t have the time to talk to those morons), was not well perceived:
POST 1: 
The DNC also manipulated the electronic voter rolls, physically blocked ppl from voting, threw out millions of ballots, and &quot;lost&quot; thousands of voter registrations
POST 2:
You can chose to believe what the media tells you. But here&#39;s some evidence for you.
(1) The DNC also manipulated the electronic voter rolls: Stanford Study showing statistically significant differences between the exit polls and electronic voting machines final tallies, compared to no statistical differences between exit polls and paper voting machines. Anyone actually watching the live results trickle in could witness these anomalies first hand. If it takes a bunch of CS students 90 minutes to hack one of our electronic voting machines, how fast do you think the DNC or other gov&#39;t agency can do it. Electronic voting machines are not safe, they are easy to hack and manipulate without detection. Go ahead do some research, open your eyes to how easy it is to change vote totals on electronic voting machines.
(2) physically blocked ppl from voting: Bill Clinton decided to stump for Hillary Clinton in front of a polling station, physically preventing people from entering the station for over 2 hours. This is just one small instance. Other instances include less than 1/2 of the polling stations being open across many states and counties, Rhode Island, Arizona and New York to just name a few, causing long lines, eventually preventing ppl from voting. There are many more examples across almost all 50 states, but I don&#39;t have the time this morning to cite them all.
(3) threw out millions of ballots: In California 8 million ballots were cast, but take a look at Wikipedia, the final totals are hovering around 5 million. So what happened to the other 2.5-3 million? They were never counted, another source. The mainstream media has worked double-time to downplay this situation, but the fact that provisional ballots were not counted, even though they should have been is deeply troubling.
(4) &quot;lost&quot; thousands of voter registrations: All of the votes from an entire district in Brooklyn were &quot;lost&quot;, every single person that registered as a Democrat in this district were unable to cast primary ballots. Its just coincidence that this is heavily populated millennial area, and that the Clinton HQs were in Brooklyn, right? Or take Maricopa County, Arizona as a lovely case study.
And just in case you were still hunting for more facts, why don&#39;t you take some time to read the Election Justice USA report on all of the voting inaccuracies, suppression and other fuckery that happened during the DNC primary. Election Justice USA is a non-profit, non-partisan organization whose mission is to expose voter corruption.
I don&#39;t have more time to cite sources, and unfortunately a lot of information has been intentionally buried and other misleading stories have taken their place. The truth is Bernie had the people behind him, he had the momentum and he had the popular support, through decentralized efforts to commit voter fraud, manipulation and suppression, the DNC and Hillary&#39;s camp (who controlled the DNC) were able to ensure that Bernie lost. You can continue to live in your fairy tale, but until you are able to accept that our government is not accountable, and our voting practices are untrustworthy, you will continue to be part of the problem. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What is the obsession with how things get rated or posted or displayed on Reddit?  People who want hard news will seek it out.  The casual reader may bump into the news.  The obsession with Reddit&#39;s placement of upvoted articles seems to be the desire to be presented to a low level audience so they might accidentally click on the article.  If the information an article has to share is really important and a small audience sees it - that is enough.  Why spend so many hours trying to prove that Reddit, which is a private comany offering a free service, of not acting like a public forum that is absolutely fair to every view offered.  What is the obsession.  Post your interesting material and move on.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you being serious? Really? REALLY?? Wake up. It doesn&#39;t matter if you used to believe in those people, I used to, but I was honest enough with myself to see what they really were and what was actually going on. Trump is no angel, of course, but the thing is - EVERYBODY who is anybody pretty much in DC, in the media etc, are going after Trump, they are investigating him, if he is corrupt, if he&#39;s done something wrong, we will definitely find out about it and he will face justice.</p>

<p>The difference, and this is what so many fail to see, is that EVERYBODY pretty much is on the other hand COVERING UP for Clinton et al. The media, people in law enforcement, the DNC etc, have been covering up for Clinton for what appears to be a very long time. Social media is rigged in their favor, the MSM for the most part chooses to ignore revelations about Clinton and the DNC that it would be screeching about were they about Trump instead.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why people push the Clinton crimes on subs like this, because if we don&#39;t, no one will. Trump corruption is more than covered by TPTB. Clinton corruption is not, and that is a massive problem for justice and democracy and national security and everything that the US supposedly stands for.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t be that person who allows their cognitive dissonance to direct them into being a completely amoral human being. The DNC is not your family, Hillary Clinton is not your Mom-it&#39;s okay if you acknowledge that they have broken the law, that they are as corrupt as the universe is large. They duped you, they duped a hell of a lot of people. The only shame is in NOT admitting that, and being part of the crowd that tried to help them get away with it (and failed, btw).</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>I don’t think questioning the DNC is inconsistent with the subs typical readership at all. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, it&#39;s not, which is exactly my point.  It is consistent with it, which is why it&#39;s abnormal that the vast majority of stories critical of the DNC are disproportionately downvoted into negative karma when compared with stories about other subjects.</p>

<p>You are obviously determined to chalk these blatant detectable voting patterns up to &quot;complex machinations of the hive mind&quot; but the more obvious and likely explanation is astroturfing by organizations such as Shareblue that have <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/337535680/Full-David-Brock-Confidential-Memo-On-Fighting-Trump#from_embed">openly announced their intentions</a> to use thousands of paid employees to influence narratives on social media.</p>

<p>Sometimes when something seems obvious, it&#39;s true.  Why <em>wouldn&#39;t</em> they try to manipulate the story?  It&#39;s not shocking or outlandish.  This kind of thing happens <a href="https://thenextweb.com/evergreen/2017/07/11/astroturfing-reddit-is-the-future-of-political-campaigning/">all the time</a>.</p>
