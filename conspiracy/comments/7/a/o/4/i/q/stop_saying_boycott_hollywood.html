        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>When people say “Boycott Hollywood”, it seems what they mean (or how it can definitely be interpreted) is “Boycott the Hollywood entertainment industry!” since this of course is where a lot of the sexual criminality is taking place.</p>

<p>The honest truth is that this in no way is ever actually going to happen.  Hollywood is absolutely <em>not</em> going to get boycotted.  People like/love the entertainment industry <em>way</em> too much.  People saying “Boycott Hollywood!” need to make sure and differentiate the sexual criminality taking place in Hollywood that absolutely SHOULD be done away with on the one hand, and the music, film, and television entertainment aspect of Hollywood that ultimately most people <em>don’t</em> actually want anything to happen to (whether they admit it or not).</p>

<p>Do away with the sexual deviants?  Absolutely.  Cannot agree more.</p>

<p>People need to make sure they specify what <em>aspect</em> of Hollywood they want done away with, however, because just saying “Boycott Hollywood!” is ultimately an empty statement that almost <em>no one</em> is going to move forward with.</p>

<p>People love their movies - and justifiably so.  Movies and good art are indeed cool and inspiring and awesome.  The entertainment industry <em>shouldn’t</em> in any way be done away with.</p>

<p>The shit criminal aspect of it definitely <em>should</em> be done away with, however.</p>

<p>So, again, people need to specify and not just say “Do away with Hollywood!!” as if they’re calling for the downfall of the entire entertainment industry en toto.  That’s a ridiculous assertion and that will absolutely <em>not</em> happen.</p>

<p>Do away with the <em>shit</em> aspect of the entertainment industry.  Sure.  Yeah.  Easier said than done, but I don’t disagree with that part.  People need to specify that, however.  Otherwise the whole “Boycott Hollywood!” movement comes across as empty and is a statement that means nothing and will do little.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>See?  This is exactly what I&#39;m talking about.  How many comments have been made just like this one?  How many people who on one hand yell and scream for &quot;all sexual deviants to die!  Fuck Hollywood!&quot; and yet on the other say &quot;Oh but please, please, <em>please</em> don&#39;t take away my &#39;X, Y, Z&#39; show!!  I <em>love</em> that show!&quot;</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying <em>you&#39;re</em> doing this, mind you.  I&#39;m just using your comment as a launching off point for saying what I&#39;ve seen from others and how it&#39;s not &quot;ALL OF HOLLYWOOOOOOD!&quot; that should be brought down, but a specific <em>aspect</em> of it that definitely needs to get brought down.</p>

<p>People need to specify more clearly - and if we do, then we can fight against sexual deviance in Hollywood <em>and</em> also still keep the good aspects of the entertainment industry that many like/love intact.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You assume and it does nothing but make you sound more and more stupid.  Whatever &quot;culture&quot; you think you&#39;re involved in is obviously not helping your critical thinking skills because you couldn&#39;t be more incorrect about your assumptions.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t even understand that the &quot;real musicians&quot; that you listen to, you know about BECAUSE of that very industry you vilify so blithely.</p>

<p>...You&#39;re just...not thinking right.</p>

<p>You have to be a critical thinker - and you&#39;re <em>not</em> being that.</p>

<p>Do away with the bad, move toward the not-so-bad.</p>

<p>Anyway.  I have a definite feeling this particular dialogue will likely go nowhere and your next response will likely be some sort of inane attempt at qualifying your worth as a &quot;cultured human being!&quot;, so it might be a better idea to just stop this particular thread here.</p>

The sad and ironic thing about this statement on your part is that I’m a professional and educated artist - and I bet you might have even come across me and/or my work before - so your continued assumptions, as I said above already, simply keep making you look stupider, and stupider, and <em>stupider</em>.</p>

They give zero shits about a boycott of music, movies and TV. They have many other avenues of income and influence.</p>

The most effective means is to talk to strangers and to spread the word to boycott everything Pedowood and Propaganda related.

<p>As verbs the difference between protest and boycott</p>

<p>is that protest is (label) to make a strong objection while boycott is to abstain, either as an individual or group, from using, buying, or dealing with someone or some organization as an expression. </p>

<p>As nouns the difference between protest and boycott</p>

<p>is that protest is a formal objection, especially one by a group while boycott is the act of boycotting. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again, you are missing the point. A point in which I&#39;m tired of trying to get you to see. Perhaps no one you support is under 18...good for you. But the overall bigger picture of those avenues that you support all lead back to an industry that does abuse. Regardless of it you know someone or not. Book a concert....who funds it? What ticket agent? The venue? The agents?</p>

<p>Theater show...same thing.</p>

<p>Music...the goal there is to go main stream.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Watching others who are very adept at any particular sport or activity (sport or non-sport oriented) is often <em>very</em> educational and can help one who is learning improve significantly in their own craft, so watching others who know what they&#39;re doing can be a very, very worth while thing to do and shouldn&#39;t be discouraged offhand.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Well, I think it&#39;s important to effectively specify who &quot;they&quot; is.  The big money changers in Hollywood?  Yeah.  To a great extent, that might not be a horrible idea.  However, the industry is a gordian knot of very intertwined interests at this point, and navigating through it in a manner that keeps money out of their hands on one end, while still allowing one to continue engaging in worthy art on the other (whatever it might be) is no easy task, to be sure.</p>

<p>Hardly.  If you want to boycott Hollywood, then so be it.  The entertainment industry will absolutely not go anywhere, however -
 nor should it.  Various aspects of Hollywood should be boycotted, true, but art in general - visually, audially, etc - shouldn&#39;t.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Stop watching TV and movies.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No one does that en toto - nor should they - and unless you haven&#39;t watched any tv or film or listened to any music whatsoever in, say, the last 10 to 20 years, then YOU don&#39;t even do that either.  I haven&#39;t owned a television in coming on TWENTY years, and yet I wouldn&#39;t be oblivious enough to say that I don&#39;t watch films, etc.  Again, it&#39;s part of the human experience to experience visual and audial arts, and there&#39;s nothing wrong with that.</p>

<p>As I said elsewhere, sift the wheat from the chaff and just get away from the bad/shit aspects of it.</p>

<p>It’s likely that whatever you watch that you <em>do</em> like COMES FROM that very industry, however, so boycotting it means not just doing away with what’s coming out now and is “new”, but doing away with everything you likely have watched up to this point.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I forgot to mention that they also have their hands in fashion and culinary. People can boycott the obvious things marked by Hollywood but those are just the tip. In order to place a true boycott you would have to stop reading magazines in print or online, stop most of social media, stop with a lot apps and games, remove scholarships funded and backed by Hollywood...the list goes on. I don&#39;t have the answers but like I said...this one isn&#39;t it. Boycott music, movies and TV if it helps you feel better but know that you are still supporting them in other areas.</p>

<p>You are exactly right.</p>

<p>Just try to be as true as possible to having a personal stance against supporting that which seems to involve harm to others.</p>

<p>I&#39;m an ethical vegan, for example (as opposed to one for dietary or health reasons).  I try to abide by the concepts of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahimsa">ahimsa</a> in this life.  I understand that it may not always be possible to be a <em>total vegan at all times</em> given just how ubiquitous are the use of non-human animal products on this planet.  Sometimes I might eat something that unbeknownst to me might have been made with an animal product or whatnot.</p>

<p>I <em>do</em> try to keep my harm of others down to as much of a minimum as possible, however.</p>

<p>It would be delusional of me to think that it&#39;s possible to <em>neeeever</em> harm another form of life EVAR while I still live.  Hell, every breath I take constitutes the death of millions of other forms of life on at least the cellular level if not on other levels.</p>

<p>All I can do is my best at being aware of my actions, however.</p>

<p>That other user you were communicating with is just, like you said, delusional in their thinking that they&#39;re not pretty heavily plugged in to the system they live in.  If nothing else, his abject, delusional ignorance makes him all the more likely to continue perpetuating the very things he claims to be against in his life.</p>

<p>Well that&#39;s the thing.  If it&#39;s not us uniting together as a species, I don&#39;t think there <em>is</em> a way.  I personally feel that&#39;s the only way.  Seems to me anything other than that simply won&#39;t work.</p>

<p>That seems like a good idea actually.  I would not disagree with that at all.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The problem, unfortunately, is that so many people want to make it in the industry so badly that they don&#39;t even <em>need</em> to be told to keep quiet.  They do it without anyone forcing them to because they fear it will keep them from getting work.</p>

<p>It seems that <em>not</em> blacklisting the people that have been coming out is a good start.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK. That&#39;s fair. You are right, their reach is far and wide. I, for example, am required by contract to pay for cable. I have no way out of it. I&#39;ve paid for cable for over ten years without ever hooking up a TV.</p>

<p>Boycotting, on whatever level people can do, is the only real option we have. Every little bit helps. Some of us will take more aggressive stances than others. As long as every does their part, things will improve. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Says the guy who pays for cable lol. I can promise you that you buy nestle products....which is tied into Disney...which ties into Hollywood. Do you know the investors for every single item you support? Nope. You would surprised to find out just how much you support Hollywood without even knowing it. Again, a boycott of all of Hollywood is almost impossible. Go and tell all of these people to give their sports that they watch religiously lol good luck. That too supports Hollywood. Just about everything leads back to HOLLYWOOD. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep, I&#39;m using my internet as you are using yours. Difference is...I&#39;m not delusional... I know exactly how the system works. You do too but you like to place blame elsewhere. Lol. I could go to bed and not engage you but I&#39;m not sleepy yet, I don&#39;t want to read a book, not a big movie or TV person and everyone else is sleeping...that leaves you. You are a contradiction waiting to happen. I&#39;m here to watch you seesaw back and forth while digging your hole deeper. This is entertainment not produced by Hollywood but yet in still Hollywood got their cut by payment for the WiFi. </p>
