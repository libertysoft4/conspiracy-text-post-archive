    <div class="md"><p>The most suspicious part of the post spectacle events is, given the prevalence of cameras in vegas, how they kept changing the story. We know they probably had eyes on the whole thing, so the only reason they&#39;d be changing their story so much is that they are fabricating it.  Hence people are asking for the footage. </p>

<p>Given the fbi&#39;s recent history of cultivating terrorists (many stories on this if you duck duck go it), the most plausible theory is that they are involved and covering things up.  Simple logic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The best and most reasonable explanation of the changing timeline is that from the moment the last bullet was fired everyone here and news cameras and reporters were nonstop &quot;what happened what happened what happened what happened excuse me what happened&quot;.
They gave updates as best they could while processing an enormous amount of evidence, witnesses, audio, and video. While at the same time having the swarm of bees that is the constant questions from the media.
All they can do is give the answers they think are correct at that moment because people wont accept &quot;we dont know&quot;.
So if later they find out more info they have a different perspective.</p>

<p>You cant demand immediate answers and correct answers at the same time following an incident like this </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you take your reasoning on the non video release i.e., &quot;it&#39;s an active investigation...they don&#39;t need to&quot; why do they give &quot;updates and answers&quot; to questioning media and public. If we took your stance we&#39;d never know anything about anything. I mean give me a fking break...they just released SOME of the JFK documents 25 years later, and if it were Obama/Clinton/Bush sitting in White House, you can bet your ass they&#39;d be sealed for another 25 years.</p>

<p>why are you skeptical? he was there for multiple days checked in as two people in multiple rooms he could easily have had 5 suitcases brought up with him during check-in which could contain 6 or 7 weapons or more for that matter. he could then bring in more during successive days either on his own or using a bell hop and no one single event would seem odd and there would more than likely be different people handling it each time. this all seems very plausible to me. I&#39;ve stayed in hotels, brought in my own luggage and used a luggage cart and no on bats an eye at this it&#39;s pretty common actually. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s be honest, he&#39;s not giving bags containing weapons to the bell hop. I say I&#39;m skeptical because there is absolutely no reason for one single shooter to bring 23 guns to his room to carry out this attack. To me, this one fact is the most tangible piece of evidence that there&#39;s more to the story.  I&#39;m skeptical not only because he brought more guns than his two arms could ever shoot, but on top of that each time he made a trip to bring more weapons up he took an unnecessary risk of getting caught. </p>

<p>there were multiple jammed weapons in his room afterwards, my thought is he brought so many because of the add-ons (bump stock/other mods) have a tendency to jam, he knew this, and he was coming prepared. He had years of experience with guns and we can guess that he had experience with the guns he recently purchased too so he would have expected the jamming issues and accounted for them by bringing backups. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would assume a bell hop wouldn’t bat an eye to a heavy bag, when I travel I can easily get my large suitcase up to 100 lbs if not more and that’s with no weapons. If he took the guns apart and wrapped them in some clothes and put them in a large suitcase it wouldn’t weigh as much as your thinking, maybe 65-75 lbs no bell hop would ever notice. Especially the fact that he was a high roller no one was going to question anything he did, mgm would fire any bell hop almost immediately if they came to them about some heavy bags before they bother a high roller that’s already staying in Complementary rooms</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t have much of a problem with him getting the guns to his room. A luggage cart and 4 bags could do it no problem. I do agree with you on the number of guns being strange though. Gun jams happen but gun people know how to clear them. Barrels do overheat when fired at that rate though, maybe that&#39;s part of the reason he brought so many. Either way, everything is a little more suspicious than the public is being made to believe I think.</p>

<p>Assuming Paddock did this, he is crazy, but not stupid. A lot of planning and thought went into this. The guy was rich, he held a pilots license, he understands the concept of eliminating unnecessary risk. If you think for a second that someone like Paddock would have risked giving a bell hop his weapons you&#39;re naive.</p>

<p>Right, agreed, but I was specifically responding to the part of OC&#39;s comment that said &quot;he was there for almost a week. Incredibly easy--and inconspicuous--to walk in and out a few times per day with luggage over the course of his stay.&quot; The new intel shared in the 20/20 special implied that he brought his <em>entire</em> arsenal into the hotel <em>on the day of the shooting.</em> Which is just absurd. It&#39;s more believable that he gradually brought everything in over the course of his stay, like OC said. But for him to have driven 700 miles (~10 hours of driving) + single-handedly moved 23 guns, 10,000 rounds of ammo, several drills, cameras, laptops, monitors, gas masks, bulletproof vest and other survivalist gear, etc., from his house to his car AND from his car to his suite, is simply too ridiculous for me to believe. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you go down the list of who has the footage it&#39;s pretty easy to see why nothing has been released. I&#39;m not sure I agree with that decision but I can see why it&#39;s happening. 
You figure local PD had the case taken away from them right away by the feds, that removed a whole lot of local leaks. MGM is in full PR damage control mode. They don&#39;t want any more news cycles of MGM + Vegas shootings. News networks have moved on to other stories, so there doesn&#39;t seem to be a lot of pressure to release info or even push for more info.  </p>

<p>Soooo that only leaves the feds as a source of footage. Why would they release footage in an active investigation if they don&#39;t think it would help their investigation? Pressure from the press? What pressure? Public outcry? I don&#39;t even see any, not really. I&#39;ve mentioned this in past threads any info released can negatively impact a case. </p>

<p>Show a video of Paddock on a given day and you have now removed being able to use that day when asking suspects or anyone questions about that day. Where you work in say asking what he was wearing when a person saw them etc, looking to catch someone in an inconsistency. Granted at this point that&#39;s sounds foolish but feds being feds, if they don&#39;t have to do something they just don&#39;t do it. In the end the real ball drop here is our media just moving on to the next story and focusing too much on some lame hollywood sex scandal over a mass shooting. Same for the public just sort of giving a shrug that 50+ where shot and killed, but hey now that hollywood sex scandal. </p>

<p>ELI5: MGM Mommy doesn&#39;t want to share the footage being it makes mommy look bad. Federal Daddy doesn&#39;t want to share the footage being no one makes daddy do anything he doesn&#39;t want to do. The kids, Gen Pop and Press Core are not screaming about any of this enough to make Daddy do something he doesn&#39;t want to do. </p>

<p>This. They will only release footage and more information when it is of interest in helping them solve the case (i.e. ran out of leads, hit dead end, etc.). Releasing footage or other information to the public too early can actually hinder the solving of the case for various reasons (alibi&#39;s can be prepared by suspects, can no longer use it to determine credible key witnesses / suspects, the list goes on..). This is what any smart investigator would do. It&#39;s common sense, really.</p>

<ol>
<li>How is this still an open investigation.  according to the lvmpd/fbi Paddock was a lone gunman with no accomplices.  there is no one left to charge with the actual shooting as Paddock killed himself.  Case closed right?  Yet no videos released, so prob. not option 1.</li>

    <div class="md"><p>Here are a couple of reasons.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>They aren&#39;t going to release footage in an open case.</p></li>
<li><p>Lawsuits have been filed. The footage will be sealed til those are settled. </p></li>
<li><p>MGM has the right to refuse that they be made public and likely will file and injunction to make sure they are never released.</p></li>
<li><p>FOIA request won&#39;t be granted for an open case or in the reasons I stated above.</p></li>

<p>It is super easy to walk in with 10 pieces of luggage all at once or even separate. It isn&#39;t odd, out of the norm or even noticeable in those hotels.</p>

<p>Hope that helped.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why do we know 10,000x more information about someone who just did something yesterday?</p>

<p>It makes no sense. This guy has worked for several government agencies and was in a place with 100,000 cameras and has decades worth history in the US vs. 7 years. Most of which would have been investigated having worked for the DOD and defense contractors...</p>

<p>Why is killing 2 Americans with a car becoming the equivalent to 911 when a white guy just did the exact same thing a few months ago was no big deal at all?</p>

<p>Why is this a bigger deal than someone shooting over 500 fucking people? That&#39;s WAY closer to 911. Five. Hundred. Fucking. People. and the news has just moved on...</p>

<p>These differences also highlight how the establishment treats NY and CA completely differently than all the flyover states. The people don&#39;t matter even half as much unless they live in these two places. Then there is the race and religious bias issues... No one on cable news is talking about any of it.</p>

<p>How different do you think things would be if a muslim guy shot over 500 people in New York. You think we&#39;d stop talking about it after 4 or 5 days and accept that we know absolutely nothing about what happened? Come on...</p>
