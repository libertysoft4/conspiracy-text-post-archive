        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The government takes a third of your earnings from all of your hard work. And uses men with guns to lock you in a cage if you don&#39;t pay or even make a mistake paying. This money is spent paying themselves and their pensions, paying the police that terrorize citizens, paying absurd prices for medicaid that goes directly to the pharma industry, and paying to send American citizens and paid private mercenaries to risk their lives all across the globe murdering innocent people and stealing resources.</p>

<p>Part of your paycheck is taken from you to pay police that murder citizens with impunity, legally steal assets and money from innocent people, and enforce draconian laws. 
These armed men will come on your property in military riot gear with no warning, sometimes murdering innocent people or killing their pets, simply to arrest people for collecting rain water, having solar panels or turbines or growing a plant that is legal in your state.</p>

<p>Children will be ripped apart from their parents if their horrible ailments are treated with plants that are legal in the state but illegal federally or not FDA approved.</p>

<p>Citizens are arrested for personal drug use and sent to prison where they are tortured by corrupt guards, locked in isolated cages until they go insane, and are forced into slave labor making pennies an hour.
Meanwhile the government has been caught numerous times smuggling drugs into the country and making billions selling it to Americans.</p>

<p>The government illegally spies on every single person in the country. Making record of every call, text, email, and web habits. The government infects our technology with malware in order to secretly record us and steal our information.</p>

<p>People who expose these illegal crimes are either jailed or live a life on the run holed up in foreign countries and embassies.</p>

<p>Our intelligence agencies spend time and money tricking mentally disabled people into committing terrorist acts only to &quot;catch&quot; them and pretend they are competent. </p>

<p>Our government officials bounce back between private work and government positions in order to pass legislation that causes direct harm to the American people. These same officials will use hundreds of billions of dollars in tax payer money to bail out investment banks who knowingly defrauded their customers.</p>

<p>Trillions of dollars go missing or unaccounted for from the budget with no explanation. The government uses a financial crisis to collect up all the gold owned by Americans citizens and then refuses to allow an audit into fort knox to make sure it&#39;s still there. </p>

<p>Politicians create foundations in order to take billions in bribes from foreign government and the agencies meant to prosecute these crimes cover them up. </p>

<p>Crumbling infrastructure is left to rot leading to our children being poisoned by heavy metals, while tax dollars are spent building new NFL stadiums. </p>

<p>Those are all undisputed facts, that doesn&#39;t even going into false flags, or purposeful poisoning of the people with fluoride, or many other &quot;conspiracies&quot; </p>

<p>How the fuck can anyone think that we are the best country in the world on some crusade to spread freedom across the word? We are literally the most fucked up country on the planet. </p>

What facts and stats have you got to support your statements? 
The difference is in the country I am from we don&#39;t have gettos. 
Also, if your statement is true then why are there metal dectors in schools to detect for guns and  procedures for mass school shootings? 
You can be sure every word you write in the states is monitored by the powers that be.</p>

I buy free range all the time and our cows are all grass fed and live in fields as opposed to sheds like america. GMF is banned in Ireland too. I don&#39;t hunt. Nor do i want to. I hate spiders but still cant kill them. I respect that you hunt to eat. I cannot tolerate people who hunt for fun, nor can I understand it. I hate guns. Always have. I have never even had toy guns. I can&#39;t understand Americas love of guns. What other countries have your gun laws?? Maybe some African countries that are a bit mad. Las Vegas is a prime example of gun culture gone nuts. The ability to buy guns in supermarkets there with such ease is beyond belief. Obviously you won&#39;t agree with me! :p</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Holy shit. You believe that we can buy guns in supermarkets. You need to stop believing the propaganda. Right. Now.</p>

<p>I won&#39;t kill a spider because it isn&#39;t food, provides a benefit, and really doesn&#39;t bother me. One big guy today tried to make a web on me while I was taking a shit. I took him by the web and put him to a more convenient place: by the window where the bugs come in. </p>

<p>Ireland has much better animal welfare laws than the US but if I weren&#39;t to hunt, I would be on a factory farm meat (even &quot;cage free&quot; is factory farm here&quot; and corn diet. </p>

<p>Most people here don&#39;t hunt for fun. They hunt for recreation. I&#39;ve never met someone who didn&#39;t pay respect to the animal he killed, although there are those out there. Most people here hunt to supplement food, get back to their natural instincts, and harvest what was given to us. </p>

<p>When you&#39;ve killed what you eat, you respect it for what it is. Every deer I kill is just a little different than my dog. Every turkey I kill is just a little different than my conure. Every squirrel we kill is just a little different than the gerbil I had as a kid. </p>

<p>What do you think about when you eat your meat? How it has a great life grazing in fields so it&#39;s all good? What I think about is that I just took this animal&#39;s life and I&#39;m sorry for it but I need it. I&#39;m not a religious person but I say a little something for him. </p>

<p>The worst is that moment when s/he&#39;s dying. Have you ever felt that? A life leave? There one moment, gone the next? It weighs on my mind. I have a freezer full of turkey and venison. I know the exact moment each one of those animals died and remember it. Do you remember where your last steak was made?</p>

<p>Guns make me remember. If it weren&#39;t for guns, I wouldn&#39;t be able to eat a decent meal. If it weren&#39;t for guns, I would be eating the nameless, faceless steak that you do.</p>

So why aren&#39;t Americans having more experiences? Why aren&#39;t Americans traveling the world?<br/>
1. America is pretty isolated. We have Canada and Mexico but aside from that, we&#39;re traveling half away across the world into unknown territory.<br/>
2. Americans are kept in America via fear. Fear China, Russia, Middle Easy, don&#39;t go to South America or you&#39;ll get Zika, avoid Europe they&#39;re flooded with immigrants, etc.<br/>
3. Cost, most Americans literally can&#39;t avoid an international vacation.<br/>

    <div class="md"><p>Quite the simplistic view there, oh and all that could be paid with a 5% tax or something. The vast majority of the money goes to wellfare(social security, Medicaid), and the military. Something like 50% of the income.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No more like, they take from me, and I get nothing back. Maybe 5% of my taxes actually go to help me. </p>

<p>I make too much money to get wellfare, but I struggle, but I have a car and a home, but not much of anything else. No internet, no tv, cheapest phone plan I can get. I can barely afford to feed my family, but I manage. The town I used to live in is getting over run by drugs, and the police protects them. They are &quot;undercover agents&quot;, but all they do is sell massive amounts of drugs. I backed the fuck out of that and moved, because I was probably gonna be killed for what I figured out. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a bunch of bullshit. Like half the people around me, are unemployed, sit around and do drugs all day, get all kinds of free money, in food stamps, Medicaid, then I see some Mexicans with thousand dollar checks from the treasury. It really pisses me off. I pay half my money in taxes. Probably 600 a week in income and fica, then 10% sales tax, plus all kinds off fees, a 911 fee, a car tag fee, a fee to put a vehicle in my name, a fee to give the court money, because a fucking corrupt little town put a 35mph speed limit on a state road, so they could bring in more revenue. ( The road is designed for 65mph, built with federal and state money ).</p>

<p>It&#39;s a bunch of bullshit. If you are a piece of shit, the government literally subsidizes you, and if you are honest and try and support yourself and your family, the government takes everything they can get from you, and sells drugs to your kids.</p>

<p>Then if you get caught with weed they get a couple thousand off you, but if you get caught with meth, cuz those pieces of shit have no job, or money, they just let them go. Maybe put you in jail for a few days and make you get sober.</p>

<p>I hate to be cynical, but I believe in organized evil, I believe in the devil, because I have no idea why people wouldn&#39;t just want to do the right thing. It&#39;s very intentional. They want to destroy good people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes we&#39;re overtaxed and this sucks. But look at your family tree, ask what they were doing 50, 100, 200, 500 years ago.</p>

<p>You can drink from your faucet (except in Flint, MI, agreed), take your car that has airbags, uses fuel that will not fuck up your engine, drive to work with traffic lights ensuring safe crossing, on roads that are not made from dirt or clay, have the water that flows into drains and pipes when it rains, get to work for a decent wage, even if you&#39;re a women or black, for an employer who has to provide you with pee breaks, a safe OSHA-compliant environment, get into an elevator that has been inspected and will not kill you (like these videos in China), have time for a lunch, then you get to use electricity for your computer  at a regulated tension and frequency, on a network defined by DARPA and that is mandated to be non-discriminatory and if your boss wants to have sex with you it&#39;s gonna be considered inappropriate and he cannot fire you for saying no. Then you go home, mostly safe from drunk drivers because the police is there to make spot-checks, and you know that the overwhelming majority of all other drivers have a driver&#39;s license and that their vehicles comply with a set of rules. Then comes your vacation and the plane you&#39;re taking is followed from point A to point B by properly trained professionals by systems that are maintained following very strict guidelines.</p>

<p>But it all probably happened by itself, by the magic of intelligent design. Not 2000 years of trials and errors and pooling of resources and years and years of education to build it, perfect it and keeping it up.</p>

<p>That would be silly. Everyone for himself, right?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have no problem with some taxes for basic things, but just go on Google and look up the budget. Everything you listed can be covered with 5% or 10% of what they tax us now. Something like 85% of the revenue goes to the military, or welfare. I don&#39;t mind a little out of my check to help people who are extreamly unfortunate, but how many people on wellfare actually need it? Out of 20 or so people I bet the people who actually need it are like maybe 5. Those are old people, or people who are retarded, paralyzed or something. Most people on it are either drug addicts, drug dealers, young adults who don&#39;t want to work, single moms who made a bunch of bad decisions in their life, and now work at burger kind in their 30s, Illegal immigrants, and generally anybody who thinks they are a victim and can&#39;t work.</p>

<p>It&#39;s bullshit, the money doesn&#39;t just come out of the air. I dug dirt out of pipes for two weeks straight now, but I love my job because I finally make 15 dollars an hour. I work so hard for what little I have, and the government fucking Rob&#39;s me. It is theft. I have been working my ass off for 6 years straight, only been out of work about two weeks In total that time.</p>

<p>I know what youre thinking, I used to think the same. Look at the budget though. How much of that money is coming back to working people who don&#39;t get subsidized by the government? Probably 10% at the most.</p>

<p>When I made 350 dollars a week, I raised my wife and child. She couldn&#39;t work, because there was no daycare, that was halfway decent, that had an opening. I went to get food stamps because I needed them bad, they gave me 116 dollars a month. Which is like a week of groceries. It helped, but I know this girl. She&#39;s a drug addict, has no job, had her kids taken away. Nothing, no bills, no responsibility. Just under 600 a month. My wife&#39;s dad. Another drug addict. 600 a month in cash, free phone, and ebt cash. I know another dude too. He plays video games all day. Nothing wrong with him, just lazy. 400 a month in food stamps. He hasn&#39;t worked in years. Lives with friends and buys the groceries.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t care what anyone does, but taxation is theft. They fill your head with bullshit in school and on TV. Try to divide people anyway they can, but they are just a mafia. They wear a suit, and build their buildings with bricks, just to give that sense of legitamency, but they are just hairless chimps like me and you. </p>

Just because some people end up millionaires living the life of luxury doesn&#39;t mean the government isn&#39;t doing those things in general. I&#39;ll take out the things that don&#39;t happen to the average person, tell me if you still think it&#39;s a great country. </p>

<p>The government takes a third of your earnings from all of your hard work. And uses men with guns to lock you in a cage if you don&#39;t pay or even make a mistake paying. This money is spent paying themselves and their pensions, paying the police that terrorize citizens, paying absurd prices for medicaid that goes directly to the pharma industry, and paying to send American citizens and paid private mercenaries to risk their lives all across the globe murdering innocent people and stealing resources.
Part of your paycheck is taken from you to pay police that murder citizens with impunity, legally steal assets and money from innocent people, and enforce draconian laws. 
The government has been caught numerous times smuggling drugs into the country and making billions selling it to Americans.
The government illegally spies on every single person in the country. Making record of every call, text, email, and web habits. The government infects our technology with malware in order to secretly record us and steal our information.</p>

<p>Our government officials bounce back between private work and government positions in order to pass legislation that causes direct harm to the American people. These same officials will use hundreds of billions of dollars in tax payer money to bail out investment banks who knowingly defrauded their customers.
Trillions of dollars go missing or unaccounted for from the budget with no explanation. The government uses a financial crisis to collect up all the gold owned by Americans citizens and then refuses to allow an audit into fort knox to make sure it&#39;s still there.
Politicians create foundations in order to take billions in bribes from foreign government and the agencies meant to prosecute these crimes cover them up.
Crumbling infrastructure is left to rot leading to our children being poisoned by heavy metals, while tax dollars are spent building new NFL stadiums.</p>

<p>Sound like a nice place? Saudi Arabia seems like a great place, if you happened to be extremely rich or in the Royal family. Doesn&#39;t make them a good country. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Many Americans are comfortable living a &quot;decent, happy life&quot;, and to continue living that lifestyle, they are more than willing to ignore the fact that their taxpayer dollars are the sole reason the U.S. and Israeli militaries are able to terrorize people in third-world countries. </p>

<p>Most Americans are more than willing to continue to live the way they are living, although men, women and children in other parts of the world have to work in terribly conditions for little pay so that Americans can continue to enjoy their way of life. </p>

<p>The people in the rest of the &quot;undeveloped&quot; and &quot;developing&quot; countries of the world supply the labor and goods that give Americans their lifestyle. Ignoring this in order to continue living a &quot;decent, happy life&quot; is indeed delusional, and there is indeed something wrong with that!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So let me ask you: what do you expect me to do? Not pay taxes? Pay more for jeans because they are made in America? Am I supposed to donate all my money to a charity (which is probably misusing the funds)? Am I supposed to live a miserable life because someone else is? Did you move to an undeveloped country so you can suffer? Exactly what REAL LIFE actions are you taking to fix the issue? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually, I did indeed move to a third-world country (Egypt) in large part because I could no longer accept contributing to the American machine. I&#39;m not suffering, thank God, but at least I know I&#39;m not helping fund the U.S. military and, in turn, the State of Israel. Not everyone is willing to leave what they know, however, so I can&#39;t necessarily tell you what you should do. A lot of the products and things I&#39;m used to having are not available here, but it&#39;s worth knowing I&#39;m no longer participating in a system I disagree with.</p>

<p>Everything you said is so extreme. No one said you have to donate ALL of your money to charity, but donating what you can afford within reason is advisable, and even better, giving actual food and toiletries directly to people in need, bypassing charities altogether. No one said you have to live a miserable life, but being conscious of how America acquires goods and services and contemplating how you can help even the scales would be admirable. </p>

<p>Or you can carry on as you are and continue to justify doing so on the internet, arguing that most Americans are not living in delusion but are, rather, merely &quot;carving out&quot; decent lives for themselves. It&#39;s your free will, so do what you see fit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I applaud you for standing on your principles. Too many people on this subreddit think that sitting around here pissing and moaning about the government somehow means they are &quot;doing something&quot; about it, which they believe entitles them to some type of moral or intellectual high ground over those who aren&#39;t &quot;WOKE AF&quot;, when in fact, the ONLY difference between those who are &quot;woke&quot; and those who are &quot;delusional&quot; is the former claim to know better (but do nothing about it), while the latter are blissfully ignorant and just trying to provide for themselves and their family.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t change the fact that my tax money funds bombs dropping on a foreign country (aside from casting a vote, or writing a congressman). I just can&#39;t. But I do have an obligation to keep a roof over the head of my family, and put food on the table.</p>

<p>I see both sides of the argument, but the REALITY is I don&#39;t see whats so abhorrent about trying to create the best life we can within a framework we can&#39;t change. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There isn&#39;t a government on Earth that is not corrupt. That is my current dilemma: where on God&#39;s green Earth can I go that isn&#39;t run by a corrupt government? But I&#39;m fairly certain that the Egyptian government isn&#39;t sponsoring terror attacks domestically or abroad. </p>

<p>Here, people are jailed over mocking the president, government officials speed up legal processes for those who bribe them with money, police officers let people go who have connected families, etc., but, although the government is receiving money from the U.S. (as a result of the Egypt–Israel peace treaty) and possibly soon loans from the IMF, overall, compared to other countries, at least Egypt is not dabbling in other countries&#39; affairs or manipulating global politics in its favor at the expense of other countries, so for me, for now, this place is the best option for me to reside.</p>

<p>The governments of countries like Saudi Arabia and Turkey, however, are indeed complicit in aiding groups that conduct acts of terror against innocent people. As a former Agnostic who converted to Islam after studying Middle Eastern politics in college, I have reached a point in my faith where I would love to live in Saudi Arabia because of the way the religion is practiced by most people, whereas Egypt is much more lax in its practice of the religion, but the corruption of the Saudi government exceeds the corruption of the Egyptian government, so for now, this is where I intend to stay.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sure I did. Three years ago I thought it was sexist that God in the Qu&#39;ran orders believing women to conceal their beauty with loose fitting clothing. Now I desire to take it a step further and wear the niqab, but that is something most women in Egypt don&#39;t do, and legislation is proposed from time to time to ban the face veil. In Saudi Arabia, it would be totally normal. I&#39;ve reached a point where I&#39;m sick of having to decline to shake the hands of men I don&#39;t know; again, in Saudi Arabia, no one would even think to put me in that position. There are many women in Saudi Arabia who are not sincere about their religion and who would probably love to live in a Western country. I&#39;m the opposite; I left a Western country hoping to come to a Muslim-majority country to practice my religion, but Egypt is very open to Western society. My husband even had to shave his beard to renew his Egyptian national ID card! In a Muslim country! Having a beard is to men what wearing the hijab is for women. It blew my mind.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t expect everyone to understand this, but after years of research (which started with my suspicion that 9/11 was an inside job...), I have concluded that the ultimate conspiracy is to lead people away from a belief in God and the Afterlife.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;And [when] the true promise (the Day of Resurrection) has approached; then suddenly the eyes of those who disbelieved will be staring [in horror, while they say], &#39;O woe to us; we had been unmindful of this; rather, we were wrongdoers.&#39;&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t have anything against Muslims, I was in university for aviation when 9/11 happened, and I had quite a few Muslim friends. It was pretty sweet to have a buddy that would always be the DD. </p>

<p>I took the opposite approach to you, with different religions. I was raised Catholic, just thought of it as a Sunday chore. Then I suddenly became devout for a couple years. Then I realized it&#39;s all BS. There&#39;s no way any of any religion makes sense. I&#39;m not usually outspoken about it but it really makes no sense. I really don&#39;t understand how I convinced myself of it. I would actually pray to Saint Therese to help me find my keys because she was the patron saint of lost stuff or something.</p>

<p>As far as shaking hands go, I don&#39;t like shaking hands. If my big boss comes down, I&#39;ll do it out of respect but if I meet someone I&#39;ll politely decline and offer a bow. I don&#39;t like germs and stuff.</p>

<p>Go visit <a href="/r/watchpeopledie">/r/watchpeopledie</a> and see women being stoned, likely falsely accused in countries like Saudi Arabia. At least if you have a hajib you have some anonymity, what if you are mistakenly accused?</p>

<p>Just out of curiosity, because I&#39;m not well versed in Islam, but what does it give you? I know the whole 72 virgins for martyrs and whatnot but what do you get?</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>[...] likely falsely accused [...]&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How do you know they were falsely accused? The only crime in the Qu&#39;ran punishable by stoning is if a married man or woman cheats on their spouse and they are seen doing so by two witnesses. If the only witness is one person, but the witness and the accuser have to swear to Allah, be He glorified in the highest, that they are telling the truth. If only the witness swears this oath, and the accused is hesitant to do so, the accused is found guilty and sentenced to death. If the witness is the one who hesitates to swear to Allah, be He glorified in the highest, that what they have testified is the truth, their testimony should never again be believed. If both the witness and the accused swear to Allah, be He glorified in the highest, that they are telling the truth, then nothing is done to either of them, and we take comfort in the fact that the liar will be dealt with justly by Allah, be He glorified in the highest, on the DAy of Judgment.</p>

<p>So if you saw a video of a woman being stoned (and what kind of person would film that a put it online anyway?), then she was more than likely accused of and found guilty of adultery. Don&#39;t sympathize with wrongdoers.</p>

<p>Of course, people are often corrupt. Perhaps some of these people were indeed falsely accused of a crime and killed unjustly. If that is the case, the ones who participated in the killing of a falsely accused Muslim will be &quot;the fuel for the Hellfire&quot;, as this is the punishment Allah, be He glorified in the highest, promised any person who wrongfully, deliberately takes the life of a believing person. God is not unjust.</p>

<p>The idea that men get &quot;72 virgins&quot; in Heaven is really mistranslated and taken out of context. If a man is killed for his adherence to Islam, he is a martyr. He will be married to beings in Paradise that have &quot;never been touched by human men&quot;. They are like fair women with wide, beautiful eyes, but they are not like humans who have lived on Earth; they were created in Paradise for the sole purpose of companionship with the most devout of human men who enter Paradise following the Day of Judgment.</p>

<p>If a righteous woman enters Paradise, she, like a man, will have anything she so desires. The Qu&#39;ran says the people of Paradise will be dressed in fine and thick green silk garments with bracelets of gold, reclining on thrones under pleasant shade. There will be no feelings of envy, sadness, tiredness, sickness, boredom, anger, etc. Everyone will be in a constant state of delight. A person will reach up while sitting on their thrones and couches to find in their hand low-hanging fruit, similar to the foods they enjoyed in this world. There will be no need to use the bathroom, and a person can eat and drink as much as they desire and never feel uncomfortably full. </p>

<p>There are seven levels of Heaven, and seven levels of Hell. What a person receives in Paradise/Heaven will be based on which level they attained with their deeds in this life, but no one will envy another for their position, and all will be so delighted with what they have that they will have no desire for removal therefrom. The homes for the people of Paradise are like ornate palaces. There is a hadith (saying attributed to the Prophet Muhammad, upon whom there is peace) that says that Paradise will have what no eye has seen, what no ear has heard, and what has never even entered the mind of man. Sounds like a desirable reward for doing righteous good deeds in the temporary life to me! Especially compared to, ya know, drinking water like boiling oil that scalds one&#39;s face—the provision provided to the people of Hell.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t mean to meander or demean, but if you realized this just a few years ago, I&#39;m guessing you&#39;re young. I remember realizing that freight sometimes went nearly cross country without stopping. Decided to hop on one to see how far it would go. I wanted to be a hobo. Like a new Jack Kerouac!</p>

<p>After a few hundred miles a couple of other guys hopped on with me and started talking about how hard it is. RR police will beat the shit out of you, sick their dogs on you, drop you in the middle of nowhere, etc. Next time the train slowed down, I jumped ship. I called my dad and said, &quot;Dad, I fucked up again&quot;.</p>

<p>The dude who I was always terrified of drove 250 miles in his &#39;84 Volvo 240 DL to pick me up and told me, &quot;Frank, it&#39;s time to grow up&quot;. And I took that to heart. I told him, &quot;Love you Dad, I&#39;m going to get it together&quot;. </p>

<p>After that I fucked my life some more for a decade or so but I&#39;m doing pretty good now. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t remember how I got on this tangent or to who or what I&#39;m talking about. I think I drink too much. But I&#39;m getting better. Life doesn&#39;t suck nearly as much as it used to.</p>

<p>Oh, you&#39;re the Muslim lady, right? Hey, you seem alright. I think Islam is fucked and I really don&#39;t like it but I do think there are good people of all colors and religions and all that. And anyone has the potential to be a good person, I think we all just need to look inside and see what&#39;s making us a bad person. Because we&#39;re all bad people in one way or another. Say you don&#39;t wear your Hijab (should I capitalize the H?) one day, you might think that&#39;s wrong. Say I fuck up everything in my life because I&#39;m a drunken asshole, it&#39;s all the same thing. We&#39;re all trying to get better.</p>

<p>Damn, just realized that comparison. I wasn&#39;t trying to make it like that. It&#39;s cool if you wear the h/Hijab if you want to. It&#39;s not cool for me to be a drunken asshole because I don&#39;t want to. </p>

<p>Did I just fuck up my whole life? I had my first girlfriend at 32 and she was 19 and super cute. What the fuck did I do?</p>

<p>I&#39;m not really sure what to make of this response. I truly hope you can manage to overcome your desire to drink alcohol. It inevitably does lead to regrets and poor decision-making. It gives you a temporary mental vacation from life&#39;s problems, but when you sober up, those problems are still there to be dealt with. My mother has had a lifelong problem with drug and alcohol addiction; I&#39;ve seen firsthand how a life can remain idle for decades while the person drowns their problems with substances. </p>

<p>This life is test of our character, how we deal with the situations we are put in. After hardship comes ease, and then hardship returns. One trial after another. When things are hard, our patience is being tested. When things are easy, our gratefulness is being tested. This is life—a brief test. </p>

<p>No matter what age we are, we all have the ability to start over in the eyes of our Creator. Once one becomes conscious of God and the Afterlife and the meaning of life in this material world, if they seek forgiveness and a chance to move on, God will grant them that, and all of their past deeds will be forgiven. When one repents and desires a chance to start over, they start being judged by God only on what they do from that moment forward. For anyone who feels like they messed up in the past, myself included, an opportunity like that is a breath of fresh air that really inspires the motivation to move forward and do better and better all the time. Wish you all the best.</p>

<p>Um what? Income taxes aren&#39;t used for anything? Than why are we paying a third of our income if that money just sits there doing nothing? The government spends all that and then has to borrow when they go over every year. And then part of our taxes goes directly to paying the interest on that loan.
The federal reserve creates dollars, the federal government then borrows those dollars. The federal government doesn&#39;t create any money whatsoever. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>we are paying taxes because no one seems to understand monetary sovereignty and also it limits people from having greater economic power/freedom, like you&#39;re reasoning. Tax money is literally destroyed upon receipt, the government doesn&#39;t hold money it creates it, the debt is t bonds and issuing this debt is what creates dollars in the private sphere, the government is monetarily sovereign. The debt doesn&#39;t need to be reduced as that reduces the money supply and amount of existing wealth in the private sector. </p>

<p>Just freaking google monetary sovereignty instead of &quot;fed is evil Ron Paul 16&quot; or whatever same information you&#39;ve endlessly imbined the past two decades. This isn&#39;t opinion, this is literally how the economy functions. </p>

<p>So a poor and stupid person born into a welfare collecting family in the slums of LA has the same chance of becoming a billionaire as Donald Trump did?
So because other countries have high taxes too, I should be fine with the government stealing a third of my work with the threat of violence and jail? That&#39;s like you telling an African to stop complaining about starving to death during a drought because none of the other planets in the solar system even have rain to begin with.</p>

<p>&quot;People who didn&#39;t try hard in high school and college have only themselves to blame for their poor choices in life&quot;
I would disagree, there are plenty of successful billionaires who dropped out or didn&#39;t even go to college or graduate high school. If people aren&#39;t successful it&#39;s a combination of either not being very smart, not being born with the right connections, or not trying hard enough. </p>

<p>Just because it is easy to become successful doesn&#39;t mean that I should be okay with being robbed blind by the government, spied on, being assaulted by police, and corrupt politicians taking bribes from corporations that directly hurt me. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, if you go into a STEM field, you&#39;ll make money. There&#39;s a huge shortage in those fields and that&#39;s why they have to bring in immigrants to fill them. I make enough money to do whatever I realistically want. You&#39;re a rarity and you know it. 99% of people in your shoes would end up continuing the poverty cycle. I know in the back of your mind, you know you didn&#39;t try hard enough in school. That&#39;s where the problem lies with everyone. They try to take the easiest path in life. Fuck that. I had the foresight to see that getting a non-STEM degree is waste of time and money. I didn&#39;t have American parents to guide me. My parents barely knew how high school worked. To make matters worse, I am an Arab-American so I&#39;ve faced a lot of hardship in my life in regards to racism and xenophobia. I&#39;m as American as anybody here, but to many people they just see me as some guy who is the enemy. I took all that and used it as motivation.

<p>I didn&#39;t try in school because I knew I wanted to have my own business and be self employed. I tried exactly as hard as I wanted. I used college as a time to have fun and party and figure out what sort of things I liked and wanted to do for the rest of my life.</p>

<p>&quot;I had the foresight to see that getting a non-STEM degree is waste of time and money.&quot;
This is exactly my point. Most majors in college aren&#39;t in the STEM field, so most people who go to college just end up in debt and still can&#39;t find a high paying job.
I agree with you 100% that if you work hard in school in a STEM degree that you will be very successful and make lots of money. But what if people don&#39;t enjoy doing that stuff? They shouldn&#39;t choose to do something they don&#39;t like doing for the rest of their lives, just to make money. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This sounds like whining. This is the problem with America. Too fucking delusional and detached from reality. People have had to work to survive since the beginning of time. Your kids want to eat. They don&#39;t care what level of fun your job is. They want clothes and to be comfortable. Do whatever you want in life, nobody is stopping you, but realize this is the way things are in a society. There&#39;s going to be people serving you at a restaurant, there&#39;s going to be a janitor that has to clean your piss off the floor at Walmart, there will be lazy pieces of shit who don&#39;t want to work and instead steal. That&#39;s how it has been since your great grandparent&#39;s times. Hell if you need antidepressants to get by in life, you&#39;re only to blame. Enjoy hobbies, go travel, read a book, something. Antidepressants are just a cheap bandaid. The problem lies with the individual. Ultimately at the end of the day, mentalities like yours are why America is being overtaken by the rest of the world.

    <div class="md"><p>Are you a tool or are you a human being? The problem is that people like you think that this is how a society has to be or should be. Are we really advancing if we all still have to give our entire lives away to jobs doing things we don&#39;t really care about? If we stopped accepting and participating in a system that deteriorates what we are as human beings into mindless machines we could actually advance by structuring our society based on efficiency and stability for all. We have the technology to feed the world yet we don&#39;t use it that way because we all accept a system that is driven by profit rather than sustainability and happiness. If we simply changed our mindset and ran out society based on compassion and happiness we could easily create a world where all necessities are easily produced and available for all. If we simply localized and automated the production of necessities we could cheaply and easily eradicate poverty and starvation. Instead people choose willful ignorance and accept that all of the comfort and ease they can experience in a western culture comes on the backs of starving and impoverished brown people who&#39;s resources are stolen and countries raped by the mega corporations. All the comfort of America comes on the backs of other human beings who&#39;s lives are destroyed to serve our excess and narcissism. So long as people like you simply accept that this is just the way it is and continue to play your parts as mindless drones chasing meaningless materialism rather than fulfillment our planet will continue to be raped and pillaged while half of all human beings struggle to merely feed themselves. We have not advanced at all, we have created technology that could massively help the lives of all people then we create artificial inneficiency and scarcity because it is profitable for the few and the people lucky enough to be born in one of the countries raping the world to supply their own comfort. If we continue to live such selfish lives, ignoring the strife of our fellow humans and blocking out our natural compassion with rampant egoism and narcissism we will destroy ourselves. And we will deserve it. Have you ever asked yourself what it is to be human? What you are? Do we only exist to be cogs in a destruction machine? Does that life give you fulfillment or only meaningless comfort. Do you love life or do you just keep going because that&#39;s what your told to do and death is scary? Does life have any meaning at all to you? Is the only purpose of living to collect as much shiny stuff as you can before you die? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I try to answer your part about Why people will not think that there country is the best and most free on earth? </p>

<p>You mentioned mean institutions on which the state spends your tax money. The major use of your money goes towards creating an Illusion that is the pain in your question. Towards conditioning you into patterns of behavior that creates a exploitive system. </p>

<p>Do you think Family, Parenting, Society, Religion,  Education, Occupations, the whole drama of Work,  right and wrong, Honesty and ethical means, Patriotism and your duty towards your society and county... and just every other IDEA currency circulating around people through spoken words, Press, TV, internet or every channel that s available to   speak or show something, is it Natural? </p>

<p>No. Its intended, manufactured and brilliantly executed through Religion, Education, Politics and Money. And its some process which has been perfected over a very long time- hundreds of years. Your present system just picks up the works of earlier Kings and use the current technology to maintain the same conditioning process. </p>

<p>Its subtle. But they always have the backing of FEAR to get the results. The Police,  the Laws, prison and the last resort, Army. And the majority they fall into lines by contionuos conditioning &#39;Monkey See Monkey Do&#39; and Fear of the laws even if they think the patterns of behavior into Family, Work etc are not correct. </p>

<p>So when you see millions overtly behaving in the same patterns,  into the same institutions then the appropriate question is:</p>

<p>How it is possible to see the truth of our management by the governments? When it is so natural and easy to be delusional about the tricks of rulers to make people believe they are free and they pay taxes for their own benefits and security. </p>

<p>The U.S has been the biggest threat to the Illuminati since it&#39;s inception. George Washington was a brilliant man, he tricked his Freemason handlers into thinking he was gonna make a fake revolution, to gather up the dissidents. What he actually did was went wrong.</p>

<p>The founding fathers kept power in the hands of the people for almost 100 years, with a few exceptions. The first Bank of the u ited states etc.</p>

<p>Eventually, they got control of the money supply, and got control of the political organizations. Started blackmailing them, and have tried to errode our rights.</p>

<p>One of the most powerful things we have was local elections. It made it hard for them to rig elections, so it slowed their progress substaintily. There is always at least a few good people in office. </p>

How do you feel about amount of money spent now when there is no one threatening the US? And you have bad roads, no free hospitals, no one to take care of the old people, so many homeless and people with mental problems, you have to pay for school.</p>

<p>Most other western nations have fell too deep into cultural Marxism. They&#39;re all fucked. If you typed this in Germany, France or England you&#39;d be arrested and jailed. If the U.S. falls to CIA-Marxist-globalization then the rest of the world is fucked.

<p>For me at least, the difference between being young and old is recognizing that western civilization is actually good and worth fighting for.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not even sure what your comment is about. You said you&#39;re happy to pay your 30% in taxes, so do you just not care that your hard earned money is being used to slaughter innocent men women and children across the globe? And you think this killing and absurd military spending needs to happen otherwise their would be anarchy in the streets of America?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Then how can you be happy to give away a third of your income in taxes, when most of taxes don&#39;t go towards making our communities better? Only about 5% of our taxes go to our infrastructure, the rest goes mostly to SS, the military, and paying the interest on our debt back to private banks. When America was started we paid around 2% in tax and were never meant to have an income tax, only a sales tax. We literally declared independence and fought a war over taxation without representation. Now we are paying 10X the tax and still don&#39;t have representation and you think this is a good thing?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>America had the best standard of living in the world back then.... But we are so much better off right now right? We have phones and TV and the internet, no wonder 1 out of 6 Americans is on depression medication. Oh wait that doesn&#39;t make any sense. Who would want to live in some third world shithole when you could live here and now where everyone miserable, obese and unhealthy?</p>
