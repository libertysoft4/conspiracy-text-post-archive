        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>In the wake of the 2016 US Presidential elections the term “Globalization” has gained additional prominence, the kind not seen since the protests and debates of the late 90’s. With it comes a dichotomy, the idea of the Nation State vs. the idea of a Connected World. Despite my beliefs that Globalization can be used as a force for good, with practices like <em>Fair</em> Trade over <em>Free</em> Trade, and proper enforcement of labor laws and regulations, that won’t be the driving thrust of this post. Instead, Globalization will provide a useful background to the debate, as it is often seen by both sides as being in opposition to the idea of Western Civilization. I’ll start by laying out what I see Western Civilization as “being”, how this applies to an American context, and finally why this is an idea that should be defended at a fundamental level.</p>

<p>The Conspiracy here is that I see many people on Reddit and in real life who do not understand the significance of Western Civ or accept that it is a reality, and I believe this is an intentional confusion. If we are severed from our own history, we can be manipulated. Why defend Liberal Democracy if you don’t know where it came from? Why defend “Natural Rights”, if one isn’t aware that Renaissance and later thinkers drew inspiration from Roman common law?</p>

<p><strong>What is Western Civ?</strong></p>

<p>Western Civilization has its roots in Greece and Rome. Homer, the Iliad, the Odyssey. These 2700 year old Poems categorize and analyze multiple facets of human nature, death, suffering, love, childhood, fate, tragedy, and so much more. It was because of the elasticity of the thought and themes contained within that they were seen as so great by the Greeks as well as the Romans. Democracy began in Athens, and Republicanism in Rome. The Classical Education, consisting of the Trivium and Quadrivium, was excellently suited for producing critical and analytical thinkers. From the core of Greco-Roman civilization Western Civ itself was born, and this kernel of thought and history was transferred through history. From the fall of Rome to our modern day, we have been engaged in an ongoing “discussion” if you will, with these ancient sources and ideas. Roman Common law established the base of English and Continental Law today. Greek and Roman Philosophy created a base from which to work forward from, and as Greek was rediscovered in Western Europe in the Renaissance, new ideas were gleaned from ancient thought. Political theorists like Locke and Hobbes looked back to Roman Common Law as a basis for natural law, individualism, and the right to self-determination.</p>

<p><strong>The American Context</strong></p>

<p>Of the three founding fathers with degrees- Madison, Adams, and Jay, they were all Classicists, because that was considered the only proper form of higher education in their day. Of those without formal education, like Franklin, Washington, and Jefferson, they were self-taught in Latin and Greek. The Founders of the United States were intimately aware of and engaging with the Classical thought of Greece and Rome. It is evident not only in their writings but in the construction of our political system itself. A Radical Democracy influenced House of Representatives with direct elections every two years, a Roman inspired technocratic Senate elected by the elites of State Legislatures (pre 17th amendment). To understand the context of our own Republics’ founding requires engaging with the same Classics that the founding fathers were so fond of.</p>

<p><strong>The Elasticity of the Classics</strong></p>

<p>As I mentioned earlier in the post, Classical thought explored so many facets of human nature. Thucydides in his 5th century BC History of the Peloponnesian war established the pretexts of the idea of political theory, analyzing how powerful states interact with one another, and how 2 hegemons can be drawn into war through mutual fear. Homer in the Iliad evokes themes not only of war and honor, but of longing, of immortality and the desire for everlasting fame, of childhood and fate, and of the ways in which man interacts with himself amidst great struggle and change, to name just a few. Cicero helped to establish a theoretical framework for modern Republics in his De Republica, with some of his most fascinating insights coming from what he claimed made a nation- the fusion of the “Res Publica”, the institutions of a country, with “Patria”, the shared history and cultural traditions of a people. </p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>All of this to show, hopefully, that the ideas, concepts, and writings from the Classical authors have continuously informed our own. Our political institutions looked to them for guidance on how to be and how not to be. Our philosophy started on the foundations of Plato and Aristotle, and worked forward from there. Our legal institutions looked for guidance towards Roman law to help establish modernity. <em>This</em> is Western Civilization. It is the constant, generational dialogue with our foundational writings, customs, and history. Without this dialogue there would be no modern “Liberal Democracy”. There would be no United States; there would be no common law. Modern Western Civilization is merely the next chapter of this story, of our interaction with the Classics and our building upon them. The continued and increased study of Classical antiquity is, to me, the ultimate defense of Western Civilization. We cannot know where we are going unless we know where we come from. Many people claim that “Western Civilization” doesn’t exist, and I hope that this post shows that, if anything, Western Civilization is a shared heritage and engagement with the culture and ideas of Classical Antiquity as embodied by Greece and Rome, and that to save and defend Western Civilization, we must remain engaged with this history.</p>

<p>To those of you who read this, thank you. I am looking for discussion on any or all points, even if it is a fundamental disagreement with my thesis. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see Globalization as an inevitability, in the sense that humanity will gradually come to recognize Earth as our only true home, especially if we ever hope to reach the stars. I think that Fair Trade and proper agreements that ensure good labor policies and minimum wages are beneficial aspects of Globalization. I do not believe that our current form of Globalization is a good thing for anyone, but I believe it is inevitable in some form. The choice is whether we ensure it is Democratic and equitable or Oligarchic, in my opinion. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Government does not mean &quot;ruler,&quot; like you are saying. Rather there has to be some sort of system to allow for things like infustructure, development of new technology&#39;s, etc. How can you do that without any government? Having the whole world be under one government does not mean that you have to add more layers too it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Did you research the term before you submitted your post? That is exactly what government is. Government produces a hierarchical structure that consists of legislators, administrators, and arbitrators. It is literally defined as &quot;a system of social control under which the right to make laws, and the right to enforce them, is vested in a particular group in society.&quot;</p>

<p>There is a lot of private infrastructure, and development in new technology. That is the government&#39;s least important aspect. A one world government requires an additional layer--it is not like we&#39;re going to replace our federal government with a one world government. That&#39;s not going to happen. </p>

<p>So you are assuming that a one world government must be identical to our Federal Government? Why must that be the case?

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly, the problem with &quot;Western&quot; though or enlightenment thought is that the basis of rationality and scientism inherently is treating what we understand as all that exists in the universe while at the same time anything that doesn&#39;t fit into the &quot;rationality&quot; bucket is immediately disregarded until 50 years later there is an experiment to prove it right.</p>

<p>Eastern philosophy on the other hand is rooted in ancient knowledge from Civilizations we are told did not exist. Knowledge that was stored in the Library of Alexandria and destroyed. Look into Taoist ideas such as the idea of yin an yang and life-force energy or &quot;chi.&quot; </p>

<p>Because Western values give me the right to choose my fraternity and not have a fraternity foisted upon me for life by the sheer randomness of my birth.</p>

<p>These values encourage creativity and hence progress, empathy and hence happiness and liberty and hence social mobility. Our lives would be severely stifled and constricted by a huge overarching authority (China/Islam) or a learned helplessness social structure (India/Mesoamerica) in those other models, which would only cause mass unhappiness.

    <div class="md"><p>Yes,   that is a key point,  the elevation of the individual in the western world view.</p>

<p>The gradual waking of the western intellect,  under the church protected religious apologetics,  a strange incubation of the Christian intellectuals that had occurred just prior to the invention of printing,  the doubts about absolute religious authority led to the death of god, with Friedrich Nietzsche,  and a sense of alienation of the individual from both god and nature.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In philosophy since the Greeks there is a distinction held between the &quot;value&quot; or ethical mode, and the &quot;logic&quot; or rational.</p>

<p>I think there is a good argument that the West somehow established the basis of a superior ethics in the political and cultural sphere (eg &quot;all men are created equal&quot;) - even as opposed to the formidable and socially cohesive Chinese Confucian conceptions of loyalty or the Indian Buddhist focus on peace and non-violence.</p>

<p>This may indeed be why the West is able to &quot;lead the whole world&quot; in many respects, despite <em>and because</em> of Hollywood.</p>

<p>The Needham Question</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&quot;Needham&#39;s Grand Question&quot;, also known as &quot;The Needham Question&quot;, is this: why had China and India been overtaken by the West in science and technology, despite their earlier successes? In Needham&#39;s words, “Why did modern science, the mathematization of hypotheses about Nature, with all its implications for advanced technology, take its meteoric rise only in the West at the time of Galileo [but] had not developed in Chinese civilisation or Indian civilisation?”[</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its a lot simpler to pose the question than to fully address it.    The isolationism of Japan and China,  the Opium Wars,  its complicated.   The Chinese actually sent a naval expedition to the west at an early stage,   came back to China,  and &quot;shut the doors&quot;.    Its wasn&#39;t simple.</p>

<p>And the ignition of the west included a kind of existential angst that has its roots in the effect of a middle eastern tribal religion imposed on whatever it was in the mythological lore of the colder northern European climates before they were ruthlessly converted.    Its not like the anscestors of the WASPs thought up the idea of becoming Christians themselves and succumed without overwhelming force.   If your ancesters are from northern Europe,  the western intellectual tradition is not your natural heritage.   It was something a whole lot more shamanistic,  and a whole lot more recent than people think.    </p>

<p>The European adoption of Christianity fed a psychopathic streak.    The influence of classical Greece and Rome was very very indirect. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, that naval expedition reached Africa about 100 years before the Portuguese first sailed around Africa. The Chinese ships were superior to the european ships. Highly likely they could have discovered Americas and threatened europe had they invested heavily in naval superiority. They didn&#39;t, obviously.</p>

<p>I agree that there was some &quot;mix&quot; of influences that ignited rational science in the west, and it may well have to do with the collision of Mediterranean culture with the barbarians.</p>

<p>But on the conversion of northern tribes:</p>

<p>As I understand it, the german tribes mostly converted voluntarily. It was in their best interests, plus the native population they had conquered was much larger than their own population, and of course all Christian. (Thinking of Goths, Franks, etc)</p>

<p>Where your statement is definitely accurate is in the conversion of the Saxon Tribe in Germany around 800 AD (not the Anglo-Saxons who had already voluntarily converted in England). Charlemagne - himself a German - crushed the Saxons and forced them to convert or die. (this may have helped precipitate the Viking invasion of Europe - another interesting tale)</p>

<p>But even the Vikings - at the height of their power and influence (1100-ish) voluntarily converted.</p>

<p>Same for the Vikings.    No one converted voluntarily.   </p>

<p>What you do is like what they did with the African slaves in America,  who also converted &quot;voluntarily&quot;.     I can&#39;t stop laughing.</p>

<p>As far as the western intellectual tradition goes,  it did bring the world to this point,  but the mantle is about to pass to China,  like it or not,  an alternative and older civilization.    Its not a matter of what you like,  its a matter of what is already happening.</p>

<p>China&#39;s ways are less linear,  less sequential in nature than western deliberations.    Western ways have already begun to adapt to the eastern intuition which is inherently more organic and less mechanical.    Perhaps the quantum and relativity aspects of physics was a turning point even in the western trajectory.    The end of a Newtonian outlook is probably a break with the classical antiquity of the west.   </p>

<p>Slackers have walked away from the western work ethic,  incorrectly called the protestant ethic.    The driving force had been to built a stairway to heaven,  a certain kind of passion had driven us to this point,  a certain set of assumptions and believes,  incorporated in our philosophies,  our religion.    We had faith in an ideology,   a world view,  a mental model,  and the definition of civilization and education meant that this idealism had been passed forward,  generation by generation.   Until it wasn&#39;t.    When exactly that shift happened we can&#39;t know,   but its been within the last 100 years or so.    Some people can see it already,  some can&#39;t.</p>

<p>It seems to me that WW2 was the watershed moment. Both world wars shattered the sense of progress and superiority in the Western way of life.

</blockquote>

<p>consider voting in secret in a situation of competing minorities.    inherent distrust and no real communication.   forced to live with majority rule.</p>

<p>now consider a smaller tribal situation where the community is not splintered into factions,  where a pow wow can be had and consensus achieved in the open through dialogue and compromise.</p>

<p>In the second case,  if you had to hold a vote,  you would already be doomed,  and attempts to rig the voting would also spell doom.   As long as there are Machiavellian politics,  and this is inherent to the cultural standards of politics in the west,  you will not really attain consensus and attempts to rig the voting are expected.</p>

<p>In a tribal situation this would have been very bad manners,  and probably considered psychopathic enough that such individuals would have been banished.</p>

<p>I would not dismiss the possible rise of a Confucian value system.</p>

<p>You might be able to have global culture without global governance.  The culture and the technology could alter communication dynamics enough that a more pragmatic and less idealistic approach can be identified.    The abstract make believe of the west is running out of steam fast,  and probably should be retired.   It relied too much on absolutes.</p>

<p>I disagree. We were absolutely gung ho about Western civilization post-WWII to the end of the Cold War. I&#39;d argue that its the end of the Cold War that led to us not emphasizing our history as much as before which is why we&#39;re in today&#39;s situation. I absolutely agree with your OP but differ on this. The lack of a competitor since the 90s meant that we weren&#39;t forced to be self critical hence what we see today that you talked about in your OP.</p>

<p>Dude, life in Asia is absolutely mechanical.

I taught myself to read when I was three. I&#39;ve been an avid reader all my life. While I&#39;ve read some classic Greek stories in high school, it wasn&#39;t until my late thirties that I  was introduced to Classical Education, the Trivium, and the Great Books. It was not apparent to me that any of it had and context or meaning, and it&#39;s opened up a whole new world to me learning how each builds upon the next.  What it means to have a representative government and why we have things like natural rights protected by a constitution.<br/>
The reason why this thread is so VERY important to this sub in particular is because of how quickly the current school system is generating people who have no idea what a  classical  education is about. It gives the wiggle room and dark space that these fucked up conspiracies seem to emerge from.<br/>
The current system is designed to output consumers and compliant, non resistant workers. It was designed in the middle 1800s in order to control the population.<br/>
It&#39;s our responsibility to speak about this subject and tell others. We are all made better by being introduced to Plato, reading Caesar in his own words, and learning critical thinking skills through grammar, logic, and rhetoric, then further on with the quadrivium.</p>
