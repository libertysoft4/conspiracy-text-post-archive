    <div class="md"><p>&quot;In the United States, martial law has been instituted on the national level only once, during the Civil War, and on a regional level only once, during world war ii. Otherwise, it has been limited to the states. Uprisings, political protests, labor strikes, and riots have, at various times, caused several state governors to declare some measure of martial law.</p>

<p>Martial law on the national level may be declared by Congress or the president. Under Article I, Section 8, Clause 15, of the Constitution, Congress has the power &quot;[t]o provide for calling forth the Militia to execute the Laws of the Union, suppress insurrections and repel Invasions.&quot; Article II, Section 2, Clause 1, of the Constitution declares that &quot;[t]he President shall be Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States, and of the Militia of the several States, when called into the actual Service of the United States.&quot; Neither constitutional provision includes a direct reference to martial law. However, the Supreme Court has interpreted both to allow the declaration of martial law by the president or Congress. On the state level, a governor may declare martial law within her or his own state. The power to do so usually is granted in the state constitution.&quot;

<blockquote>
<p>10 I rejoiced greatly in the Lord that at last you renewed your concern for me. Indeed, you were concerned, but you had no opportunity to show it. 11 I am not saying this because I am in need, for I have learned to be content whatever the circumstances. 12 I know what it is to be in need, and I know what it is to have plenty. I have learned the secret of being content in any and every situation, whether well fed or hungry, whether living in plenty or in want. 13 I can do all this through him who gives me strength.</p>

<p>14 Yet it was good of you to share in my troubles. 15 Moreover, as you Philippians know, in the early days of your acquaintance with the gospel, when I set out from Macedonia, not one church shared with me in the matter of giving and receiving, except you only; 16 for even when I was in Thessalonica, you sent me aid more than once when I was in need. 17 Not that I desire your gifts; what I desire is that more be credited to your account. 18 I have received full payment and have more than enough. I am amply supplied, now that I have received from Epaphroditus the gifts you sent. They are a fragrant offering, an acceptable sacrifice, pleasing to God. 19 And my God will meet all your needs according to the riches of his glory in Christ Jesus.</p>

<p>20 To our God and Father be glory for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most interesting bit I&#39;ve found so far</p>

<p>|What is &#39;State Secrets&#39; and how upheld in the SC?</p>

<p>State Secrets priviledge basically allows the president to withhold evidence from courts that could be a threat to national security. This priviledge was then extended to former presidents via executive order by GWB, the guy covered his tracks eh?</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_secrets_privilege">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_secrets_privilege</a></p>

<p>&quot;George W. Bush issued Executive Order 13233 extending the accessibility of the state secrets privilege to also allow former presidents, their designated representatives, or representatives designated by their families, to invoke it to bar records from their tenure&quot;</p>

<p>So basically, any evidence the DOJ could use to incriminate members of the previous administration, could be disbarred from court.</p>

<p>&quot;Combine all posts and analyze.
The questions provide answers.
Remember, information is everything, the flow of information is no longer controlled by the MSM but by you/others.
Hence, why we are dedicating &#39;critical&#39; time to distribute crumbs which can be followed in greater detail to paint the entire picture once more information is released.
Why has POTUS dedicated so much time into labeling the MSM as fake news?
Why is this relevant?
We are fully prepared that all social media will be shut down to prevent the spread of this information (i.e. POTUS&#39; Twitter etc. and/or mass censoring).
Sealed Federal orders pre-submitted as prevention and masked as &#39;in general&#39; (though that does not account for rogue agents/programmers within).
Dates (impending actions) are deliberately provided for authenticity.

I&#39;m being advised actions have created accelerated counter-actions.
We have not yet ascertained the scope of the attack.
Watch the news outlets.
POTUS&#39; Twitter take down was not by accident (as referenced several hours ago).
Should the lights go out please know we are in control.
Do not panic.
We are prepared and assets are in place.

<p>&quot;Saudi Arabia = the Bloody Wonderland&quot; = the purchasers/suppliers of human trafficking for sexual abuse further supporting my theory of Wonderland being a referencing to the child sex network
Snow White - HRC certainly has created an image of the princess who is continually abused and circumvented of her throne, forced to flee. 
Wizards and Warlocks .Perhaps those who are literally that and/or the puppet masters.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know who Q is referring to. China and Russia both come to mind, but he may be thinking of someone else entirely.</p>

<p>China can be said to control NK as NK is wholly dependent on China for trade. China <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/north-korea-china-oil-sanctions-nuclear-threat-missiles-textiles-pyongyang-donald-trump-a7962611.html">cut off NK&#39;s oil in September</a> and <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/09/28/china-orders-north-korean-business-closed-under-un-sanctions.html">closed NK businesses</a> in China. Both actions were taken at the insistence of the US. </p>

<p>From a strategic standpoint, Russia benefits more from the happenings in NK. With the US Navy tied up in SE Asia, Putin has more leeway in Syria and Eastern Europe. The main issue there is natural gas. Putin wants to sell it to Europe. He needs pipelines, which need to cross the very countries that NATO and Russia have been sparring over.  </p>

<p>There is also the Black Sea situation going down right now. A while back, Putin annexed Crimea (from UKR)  in 2014. </p>

<p>Do you know why Crimea is important to Russia? </p>

<p>Within the last few months, NATO has sent 20 ships in the Black Sea, and they are performing &quot;training&quot; operations. </p>

<p>Do you know why the Black Sea is important to Russia?</p>

<p>(Same answer to both questions.)</p>

<p>Why did his administration do little to slow their nuclear and missle capabilities?</p>

<p>Who feeds NK w/ strategic intel? Iran?</p>

<p>What deal was done with Iran under BO?</p>

<p>Why was the deal sealed under a top secret classification? </p>

<p>Why after BO left office all of a sudden NK has nukes and the tech to miniaturize for payload delivery within the US?</p>

<p>Let&#39;s try to put some breadcrumbs together... Wouldn&#39;t you riot if you learned that the Old World Order hijacked your country in order to enrich themselves even more AND destroy it at the same time?</p>

<p>Wouldn&#39;t you lose last bits of trust in the US if you learned that your own administration and your own intelligence agencies helped to cover illegal deals resulting in NK (your own asset essentially) getting advanced nuclear weapon tech and HEU stockpile of the US origin, in order to hold your own country  hostage? </p>

<p>And if any of these mini nukes exploded and fallout was analyzed, wouldn&#39;t it be clear where the uranium came from?</p>

<p>Can you imagine what would happen next? </p>

I would have loved to do something but felt powerless and then found mr. trump and listening to his words i knew what he was planning without meeting him.

Yes it&#39;s easy enough to look and say the clinton&#39;s because of the cia sold our own uranium to north korea so they could make nuclear weapons to attack our own people and work to exterminate people in our country that wouldn&#39;t fall in line with what they wanted with is global order under their rule.The clinton&#39;s are just middle level players pieces that are big but they are not the kings and queens of the chess board</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m just gonna note things as I see them. This isn&#39;t intended to be an indictment. There are many things in these posts that do make sense. I&#39;m only noting the ones that strike me a little off.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What did HRC instruct Huma to do re: Classified markings? Why is this story just now coming out?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We knew Hillary told Huma to remove the &quot;Classified&quot; markings on documents over a year ago. I don&#39;t know if the email being discussed today is the same email or not, but we had emails showing this exact same thing over a year ago.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What is the net worth of Pelosi? How does it reconcile</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s her husband&#39;s money. &quot;Paul Francis Pelosi, Sr. (born April 15, 1940) is an American businessman who owns and operates Financial Leasing Services, Inc., a San Francisco, California-based real estate and venture capital investment and consulting firm. In addition, he was the owner of the Sacramento Mountain Lions of the United Football League.&quot;</p>

<p>That doesn&#39;t mean she&#39;s not taking dirty money from elsewhere, but her having expensive things doesn&#39;t mean jack.</p>

<p>How did SA welcome POTUS during his trip?
Why was this historic and not covered by MSM?
How did SA welcome BO during his trip?
How did SA welcome HRC during her trip?
Why is this relevant? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hmm a welcome has many parts.  Not sure to which Q means, or even which trips.  These aspects stood out to me:</p>

<ul>
<li>In their most recent trips Trump was welcomed on the tarmac but Obama was not.  However, Obama was during his first trip in 2009, and Hillary in her trip in 2010.</li>
<li>Both Trump and Obaama received the highest honor but <em>different</em> flavors of it.  Trump received, and appears to be the only person to have received, the The Collar of Abdulaziz Al Saud which is for <strong>non-muslim</strong> heads of state, and considered a separate honor.   Obama received the Order of Merit.   Because the collar is reserved for non-muslim then it seems conversely that the Order must be for muslims, however the list includes many who do not seem to match that criteria:  George W Bush, David Cameron, Shinzou Abe.</li>
<li>Trump received a bouquet of flowers immediately upon welcome.  Not found anything indicating if this is significant in SA or Islam.</li>
<li>Trump and King Salman held hands while being welcomed by the Saudi Royal Court.  Link below indicates that holding hands is a sign of deep friendship and equality of status between the two parties.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Palmer report published a now thoroughly debunked (by snopes) that JK had left for Saudi Arabia because when the sealed indictments were announced because they have no extradition treaty.</p>

<p>He was back in the US to have dinner with Ivanka on her birthday on Saturday, so that&#39;s not true.  Secretary Munchin also went there at the same time, traveling separately.</p>

<p>Palmer report appears to be very frequently debunked by Snopes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No because I don&#39;t know how to find unmarked flights.  I did find some weird flight stats for AF1 (92-9000) on Flight Aware.  On Oct 4th - AF1 departed Vegas only to arrive back in Vegas 1 hour later.  Somebody had an important meeting 2500 ft in the sky that day. I&#39;m assuming the records of when AF1 arrived prior to Oct 4th is either classified or shown as unmarked arrival.     </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m no expert but it seems you can track if you have flight identification number or registration number (number on planes tail).  However AF1 decides what is shared and not shared.  That is why you cannot find all activity.  Sometimes the President can fly in a separate unmarked aircraft unknown to the public (except for air control).  Each airport from my understanding shares the unmarked flight history but doesn&#39;t share who was on the plane or owner.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, very intriguing. My first thought was that Obama has cited Godfather I and Godfather II as his favourite movies (<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/the-candidates-on-their-favorite-films/">&quot;Three not so much&quot;</a>), but it has to have more significance than just a codename for Obama, so I don&#39;t know.

    <div class="md"><p>while recently going down the planet 9 rabbit hole I discovered John Moore and noticed a reference to a map of the world from a scene in The Godfather 3. It can be seen in the official trailer on youtube about 2:08 in. The theory suggests something like a pole shift resulting in water redistribution, leading to the disappearance of Florida which can kinda be seen on that map. A stretch, but the more you look into space weather and the earths atmospheric changes...</p>

Check True Pundit web site. These Anons are fakes weaving exciting but utterly false tales.</p>

<p>Q assured us that Tony Podesta would be indicted 11/3 and Huma 11/6.</p>

<p>Those markers have come and gone and now he changes his story to a secret roundup? John Podesta &quot;on the run?&quot;</p>

<p>How gullible do we have to be to keep accepting a changing story in which the payoff/proof is always kept at arms length, just out of reach? </p>

<p>Q said martial law and riots over the weekend. When that didn&#39;t pan out, he pivots to Obama and Clinton being arrested overseas, when neither is even outside the country? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>you are being played.</p>

<p>in the course of a week, this guy&#39;s posts went from predictions about indictments and arrests to all-encompassing posts about every fringe theory under the sun. the author of these posts is intentionally branching out an ever-widening spider web of paths so that you waste your time trying to figure out what each riddle and question &quot;means&quot; rather than taking a critical look at any single claim.</p>

<p>he is seeing how far he can take this with you. the beauty of it is, even if you manage to discredit one element, there are 50 other paths you then have to follow and discredit.  </p>

<p>at this point, he&#39;s stopped making predictions altogether and is simply tossing out anything and everything to confuse:
- GPS coordinates
- Bible verses
- Donald J Trump Jr initials written in &quot;code&quot; that isn&#39;t actually code
- +++
- Random photographs
- JFK
- Game Theory
- Nuclear power plants
- North Korea, Saudi Arabia
- Dates in history
- Movie references
- etc</p>

<p>He hasn&#39;t even bothered to address Tony Podesta, Hillary Clinton or the Mueller case in days.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t you see how he&#39;s creating a directionless wild goose chase for you?</p>

<p>I see that &quot;Q !ITPb.qbhqo&quot; is at the beginning of his 3 posts on 11/9. Is that the tripcode, and how we will know which posts are from Q going forward?</p>

<p>And the <a href="https://img.4plebs.org/boards/pol/image/1510/10/1510107905656.jpg">attached image</a>, is this Q saying which posts were his and the others are disinfo? This is the part that isn&#39;t matching up for me. For example, in your OP, none of the posts made on 11/4 are bolded, but in the image, there are a lot of posts from 11/4. Are those from Q or not?</p>

<p>This Q with tripcode tries to imply that only some Q&#39;s posts are legit. It&#39;s up to you to believe it or not. In my opinion, if Q wanted a tripcode (basically comparable to a redidt username), he would have done it much earlier for example in the first post / threads, and not in CBTS #191.</p>

<p>I keep reading / archiving (until POTUS returns) but <em>not believing anybody</em> who claims that only Q with tripcode is legit.</p>

<p>I just went through the screencap matching up the posts in the screencap with the bolded ones. I found a few things of note. I&#39;ll try and explain everything as best I can but let me know if I&#39;m not making sense, it gets a bit confusing trying to reference both your OP and the screenshot. </p>

<p>FYI, I&#39;m using the timestamp from the screencap. Posts are referenced using timestamp (when available) and post #. I suck at formatting on Reddit, so bear with me. Hope this helps.</p>

<p>In: November 5 Q Clearance Patriot [2] (15 posts) the following posts are in the screencap but not bolded in OP. *some of the 15 posts are in the screencap and some are not (10 of 15 are in the screencap):</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Good catch, I missed these two. OP edited.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In some of the bolded links, some but not all of the posts are in the screencap. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because anons making the screencaps often suck! That&#39;s why I made MY OWN list using the 4plebs database. No chance to meddle with the posts. 4plebs shows all the posts made by the same ID, even the deleted once, and shows correct time (4chan /UTC), in the correct order.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I found some posts that were (most likely) not made by Q but they are included in the screencap, </p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s usually the other anons asking questions around OP, I&#39;m not archiving those. You can open the full thread and see the context for yourself, if interested.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>looking for which posts were included/excluded from screencap.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why I marked the &quot;included&quot; by marking them. The excluded ones contain important clues as well, IMO. I may be wrong, but tripcoded Q seems to be someone very interested in correcting the record... and the whole CBTS is coopted as a result. Anyone could come and tripcode Q username, right?</p>

<li><p>OP edited with a new Q post from Oct 28 and new &quot;tripcode Q&quot; posts from 11/11, and one &quot;no tripcode Q&quot; 11/11 post about TMI that I managed to detect. /pol/ ignored it.

    <div class="md"><p>Yes I have most if not all MegaAnon&#39;s posts, hitting 4000 character limit for OP so not everything is copy pasted there. She appeared in CBTS #50.. I edited the OP for a better overview.</p>

<p>Her identity was hijacked in CBTS #247. I read recent threads and you can see that many /pol/ acks concerned with <a href="https://archive.4plebs.org/pol/thread/149061733/">CBTS #247</a> where &quot;tripcode Q&quot; (IMO fake from the beginning in CBTS 191) posted old COPY PASTA. 
CBZS #247 was fake (the links in OP lead to nowhere etc). Why would Q decide to post in a shill / fake thread???</p>

<p>Cui bono? Let /pol/ argue what is real and what is fake, delegitimizing all Q ever posted. It&#39;s so obvious.</p>

<p>Fifteen months into a wide-ranging investigation by the agency&#39;s counterintelligence arm, <strong>known as Q group</strong>, and the FBI, officials still do not know whether the NSA is the victim of a brilliantly executed hack, with Russia as the most likely perpetrator, an insider&#39;s leak, or both. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s also another part further in the article that is titled &quot;The Hunt for an Insider&quot; in which they state:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For decades after its creation in 1952, the N.S.A. - No Such Agency, in the old joke - was seen as all but leakproof. But since Mr. Snowden flew away with hundreds of thousands of documents in 2013, that notion has been shattered.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The NSA has been called No Such Agency in the breadcrumbs, but I don&#39;t know how common that is. Could it be referencing the info dump in that way which implies a direct attack?</p>

<p>There is another part titled &quot;A Shadow War with Russia?&quot; which states: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Kaspersky was, in a sense, simply doing to the N.S.A. what the American companies had just done to Russian intelligence: expose their operations. And American officials believe <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/10/technology/kaspersky-lab-israel-russia-hacking.html">Russian intelligence was piggybacking on Kaspersky&#39;s efforts</a> to find and retrieve the N.S.A.&#39;s secrets wherever they could be found.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But, we now know it was actually the <a href="https://www.rt.com/news/409376-cia-wrote-code-to-impersonate-kaspersky/">CIA, not Kasperky.</a></p>

<p>The article must have been published today since POTUS returns tomorrow? Maybe as some sort of warning? This is all very interesting and can&#39;t wait to see where this goes...</p>

<p>I&#39;m only guessing here, but I get the feeling she did.

Whether you buy the &quot;Trump&#39;s a good guy&quot; version or &quot;Trump just represents a different faction&quot; version, I think her inner supporters got sick of decades of her hubris and self-worship, especially when it was becoming clear to them that she may actually lose to Trump.  In the super-cynical version TPTB realize that she&#39;s into so much corrupt shit everywhere that they identify her as a cancerous tumor requiring precision removal to maintain appearances.  Thus Trump wins, and slowly her support system comes crumbling down thereafter.  Just my 2 cents</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes I have most if not all MegaAnon&#39;s posts, hitting 4000 character limit for OP so not everything is copy pasted there. She appeared in CBTS #50.. I edited the OP for a better overview.</p>

<p>Her identity was hijacked in CBTS #247. I read recent threads and you can see that many /pol/ acks concerned with <a href="https://archive.4plebs.org/pol/thread/149061733/">CBTS #247</a> where &quot;tripcode Q&quot; (IMO fake from the beginning in CBTS 191) posted old COPY PASTA. 
CBZS #247 was fake (the links in OP lead to nowhere etc). Why would Q decide to post in a shill / fake thread???</p>

<p>Cui bono? Let /pol/ argue what is real and what is fake, delegitimizing all Q ever posted. It&#39;s so obvious.</p>

<p>The feet pics are there somewhere :)</p>

<p>Because this is MY OWN list and not a copy of 4chan hivemind, and I&#39;m judging the messages and not the messengers. Do you realize that Q started using tripcode only in CBTS #191? </p>

<p>I&#39;m only guessing here, but I get the feeling she did.  Actually, I think the more appropriate term is to say Hillary &quot;jumped the shark&quot;.  <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jumping_the_shark#/search">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jumping_the_shark#/search</a>.    Whether you buy the &quot;Trump&#39;s a good guy&quot; version or &quot;Trump just represents a different faction&quot; version, I think her inner supporters got sick of decades of her hubris and self-worship, especially when it was becoming clear to them that she may actually lose to Trump.  In the super-cynical version TPTB realize that she&#39;s into so much corrupt shit everywhere that they identify her as a cancerous tumor requiring precision removal to maintain appearances.  Thus Trump wins, and slowly her support system comes crumbling down thereafter.  Just my 2 cents</p>
