<p>The Arch of Hysteria looks to be based off of Dahmer&#39;s victim&#39;s pose. Dahmer&#39;s pictures were released in 1991, the statue made in 92-93. </p>

<p>Look at this original display: it looks like a torture room with a torture device in it.</p>

<p>Same artist&#39;s Wikipedia page describing the art series where the children are literally running away from their father who wants to have sex with them:</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Gaskell">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Gaskell</a></p>

<p>&quot;In her photographic series, hide, Gaskell references a lesser-known Brothers Grimm tale, &quot;The Magic Donkey.&quot;[11] This series features young girls alone in a gothic mansion, creating a sense of dread and underlying sexual intrigue that takes its impetus from the tale of a young woman forced to hide beneath animal skins to hide from the matrimonial desires of her father.[9] The name of the series is drawn from the children&#39;s game hide-and-seek, the dual personality of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, and the literal skin, or hide, that creates a boundary between the inside and the outside, the self and the other.[12]&quot;</p>

<p>Check this WaPo article they deleted from 2004 on Tony&#39;s art collection. 
<a href="https://archive.fo/vddrO">https://archive.fo/vddrO</a> </p>

<p>The Washington Post has removed an article in which Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta’s “art” collection was revealed to contain pictures of naked teenagers. The 2004 article, archived online, includes comments from former Clinton administration official Sally Katzen in which she discusses the “awkwardness” of being at the Podesta’s home. “At political events, there’s an inevitable awkwardness,” Katzen said. The article’s author goes on to mention the disturbing specifics of the Podestas’ taste in “art.” “Folks attending a house tour in the Lake Barcroft neighborhood in Falls Church earlier this year got an eyeful when they walked into a bedroom at the Podesta residence hung with multiple color pictures by Katy Grannan, a photographer known for documentary-style pictures of naked teenagers in their parents’ suburban homes.”</p>

<p>&quot;The pictures ringing Tony&#39;s ninth-floor office at PodestaMattoon deliver an unusual welcome. A suite of arresting computer-manipulated photographs by Dutch artist Margi Geerlinks serves as a cautionary tale of genetic engineering. One shows a boy seemingly born from a sewing machine. Another finds a young girl knitting her own hair. A third has a naked woman immersed in blood-red liquid.&quot; &quot;Though pictures rotate on and off the walls of the couple&#39;s homes, a piece in the Woodley Park living room stays. Called &quot;Soliloquy VII,&quot; the nearly eight-foot-tall color photo by British artist Sam Taylor-Wood is an update of a late-15th-century painting of the dead Jesus. Taylor-Wood faithfully replicates the original&#39;s composition, here photographing, in vivid color and minute detail, a young man laid out on his back. Just one thing: Taylor-Wood omits the shroud, displaying his subject in all his nakedness.&quot;</p>

<p>Here is the pgwiki archive on TP that was taken down;</p>

<p><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20170628151601/http://pizzagate.wiki/Tony_Podesta">http://web.archive.org/web/20170628151601/http://pizzagate.wiki/Tony_Podesta</a></p>

<p>Here&#39;s some of the artwork Tony ADMIRES as well (monsters praying on children) </p>

<p><a href="https://steemit.com/pizzagate/@gizmosia/art-podesta-admires-and-buys-you-may-never-sleep-well-again">https://steemit.com/pizzagate/@gizmosia/art-podesta-admires-and-buys-you-may-never-sleep-well-again</a></p>

<p>Here is a post about the Podesta&#39;s uncle. He is a dentist, and guess what? One of the first things online about the guy are accusations of pedophilia (IN 2013). <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1881572">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1881572</a></p>

<p>....................</p>

<p>Now, given this information, what can we deduce? At the very least, Tony Podesta has an extremely odd sense of what is acceptable art. He is good friends with a serial child molester, and has art depicting abuse of children. I&#39;ll let you draw conclusions. Thanks for your time.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t. At least not according to the artist, art historians or the MoMA. It looks like the pose from Dahmer&#39;s victims, but it also <a href="https://remedianetwork.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/arch-2.png">looks just like this too</a>. I doubt that the artist would duck the Dahmer label. But don&#39;t let that derail your narrative!</p>

<p>2: The statue in Podesta&#39;s house is decapitated. Just like Dahmer&#39;s victims. Look at the arms and hand placement as well. Much more similar to Dahmer&#39;s victims pose. The picture you sourced is not decapitated. </p>

<p>3:Did you watch the video or look at the archive link I sourced? The original display is a torture room! Another display is in a cellar with a saw. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s the thing, if you had said &quot;it sure <em>looks</em> a lot like Dahmer&#39;s photos&quot; then you would have been correct. But you didn&#39;t.

<p>Hell, the artist could have had their studio wallpapered with that photo. But you don&#39;t know that. You just assumed that it was the source with no information beyond &#39;gut feeling&#39; which is why people don&#39;t take pizzagate seriously.</p>

<p>The sculpture, name and all is a direct reference to Grande Hysterie Full Arch, an illustration of hysterical epilepsy by Jean-Martin Charcot. Bourgeois is really into Freud, who was mentored by Charcot. She also does a lot of shit with sex...the sculpture is without a head but it&#39;s also missing a dick and balls. Funny that garbage pizzagate wiki doesn&#39;t even mention the illustration by name.</p>

<p>Ok, let&#39;s say there is literally ZERO similarities between the two. Let&#39;s just ignore the arch statue entirely. What about Gaskell&#39;s art featured in his home? What about the fact he is friends with Hastert?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>She did a lot of shit with both hysteria and creepy rooms over a number of years and she commonly sculpted isolated body parts and figures missing them. How confident are you an 80+-year-old Bourgeois was familiar with that single crime scene photo years before people started putting Dahmer evidence in books and the like? Remember this was the early 90s. And how come the arms and legs of the statue are oriented more like a hysteric&#39;s than that corpse&#39;s? I&#39;m not saying Dahmer couldn&#39;t have been an influence (and so what if he was?) but it&#39;s not as certain as people are making out.</p>

<p>She was working on arch of hysteria poses since before Dahmer was even arrested. <a href="https://www.moma.org/collection_lb/browse_results.php?criteria=O%3AEC%3AE%3A4991&amp;amp;page_number=1&amp;amp;template_id=1&amp;amp;sort_order=9">See this work from 1989.</a> Plus, the arch of hyseria pose has been drawn and commented on since the late 1800s.

    <div class="md"><p>It <em>was</em> from earlier and the whole arch of hysteria pose predated Dahmer by decades, so the fact that there&#39;s a picture of a victim in that pose is irrelevant. It&#39;s just a coincidence. (Or maybe Dahmer was influenced by the arch of hysteria.) Either way, the artwork was not influenced by Dahmer.</p>

<p>Still in torture chamber is just a metaphor.</p>

<p>As for his good buddy, all he wrote was that he&#39;d kept in touch with him; he didn&#39;t say they were good friends. And of course he would have kept in touch with him – he was a political lobbyist and Hastert was a powerful political figure. He wouldn&#39;t have been doing his job if he hadn&#39;t. And did you bother to check the date of that email? It was before Hastert went to trial and months before the accusations of child abuse were made public. If someone you know and have emailed gets arrested for child abuse next year, does that make you also guilty of child abuse?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Contrast that sculpture with this so-called <em>famous</em> quote from Bourgeois...</p>

<p>&quot;Art is restoration: the idea is to repair the damages that are inflicted in life, to make something fragmented -  which is what fear and anxiety do to a person - into something whole.&quot;</p>

<p>Does that form strike you as being or leading any observer towards something restored and whole or into and towards something fragmented that induces fear and anxiety instead? Would you say it is in any way whole-some?</p>

<p>This is the same creepy woman that produced a huge oversized and nightmarish spider that when questioned about it said it was actually &quot;a tribute&quot; to her dear departed Mother and then proceeded to describe spiders in the most affectionate and endearing ways which she says her Mother exemplified.</p>

<p>This is how she exonerates and excuses the creations she inflicts on others in &quot;the name of art&quot;. Retreating and hiding behind what she claims her own personal interpretation is as if she was completely unaware of how they would affect anyone with normal sensibilities. This is the kind of psycho-babble that supports and surrounds the complete and utter fraud that most modern art actually is. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wasn&#39;t criticising, merely elaborating on your comment. There is also no such thing as Hysterical <em>epilepsy</em>, and by that I mean it isn&#39;t epileptics that suffer from it. </p>

<p>True enough it is a hysterical seizure but deemed to be of &quot;psychogenic&quot; origins... a seizure that results from some purely psychological cause. I suggest you bear that in  mind in relation to what we&#39;re actually talking about or why the Podestas are attracted to and collect the kind of &quot;art&quot;, if it can be called that, that they do.</p>

<p>As for the anything goes that I&#39;ve seen in public galleries there seems to be a huge disconnect on what passes for art not to mention what is paid for some it. It&#39;s hardly a subset when it&#39;s given the same kind of legitimacy as pieces that actually have some artistic merit and if anything induces an even greater lack of that in those that do because of it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You must give some indication of what the so-called &quot;concept&quot; you are thinking of and referring to <em>is</em> in this case and where it exists in the landscape of your own mind... what ideas lead you to it, what other ones are associated with it... and where that leads you to from there. Otherwise I have no idea of what you are actually referring to.</p>

<p>The whole process of &quot;thinking&quot; consists of moving through and between &quot;concepts&quot; all of which are linked by various &quot;ideas&quot; that make it possible to locate and more clearly identify and understand what any of them are or mean in terms of other ideas that are already known. </p>

<p>We operate and communicate with one another through a body of shared ideas and human feelings that we all possess for which the very words you are now reading are merely stand-ins for. </p>

<p>That is the underlying &quot;concept&quot; that you might call &quot;the art of writing&quot; and why it is an &quot;art&quot;, only here we are painting, if you will, with the artifice of letterforms and words whose structured combinations and overall design and flow we mutually agree and rely upon in order to effectively communicate with one another. </p>

<p>If I have something worthwhile or that I think is important to relate and communicate to you that I want to you to grasp and understand I don&#39;t give you gibberish or nonsense. </p>

<p>I have to rely on some basic and fundamental conventions that I don&#39;t play fast and loose with or throw right out the window but must concentrate on more strictly adhering to in order to have any hope of actually doing that, unless of course, I really didn&#39;t really care about that in the first place. </p>

<p>Yet why would I even be bothered to do it if that was the case?</p>

<p>I can&#39;t put any ideas or concepts into your head that aren&#39;t already there, I can only give you some of the same sign-posts, these words that are stand-ins for all the ideas we already know, share, and have in common in order to accomplish that.</p>

<p>If you accept that the Art of Communicating our thoughts, ideas and feelings as accurately as we can to one another as the essence of all true art, then any and every art is defined by just how well it spontaneously appears to do that and to what extent we can mutually agree that it does. It takes a considerable amount of invisible thought and effort to achieve that kind of spontaneous communication, no matter what form it takes. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not supposed to take any effort or imagination on the receiving end if it&#39;s to achieve it&#39;s purpose. It&#39;s the effort and imagination that supposed to go into it that makes it what it is, not the other way around.</p>

<p>Does that make my grasp of it, as you put it, any clearer to you?</p>

<p>It isn&#39;t evidence</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Rule 401 of the federal rules of evidence says:</p>

<p>&quot;Evidence is relevant if:</p>

<p>(a) it has any tendency to make a fact more or less probable than it would be without the evidence; and</p>

<p>(b) the fact is of consequence in determining the action.&quot;</p>

<p>I think you meant to say it isn&#39;t conclusive proof on its own, and you would be correct. But it is circumstantial evidence:</p>

<p>&quot;Circumstantial evidence is evidence that relies on an inference to connect it to a conclusion of fact—like a fingerprint at the scene of a crime...</p>

<p>On its own, circumstantial evidence allows for more than one explanation. Different pieces of circumstantial evidence may be required, so that each corroborates the conclusions drawn from the others. Together, they may more strongly support one particular inference over another. An explanation involving circumstantial evidence becomes more likely once alternative explanations have been ruled out&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumstantial_evidence">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumstantial_evidence</a></p>

<p>You can imagine scenarios where someone could make a circumstantial case involving the creepy artwork. Say that some skeletal remains showing signs of having the meat cut off with knives were found in the basement of his home and they were dated to a range that partially covered the time period he was in the home, but partially the previous owner.</p>

<p>Neither the remains nor the artwork is proof on its own, but finding skeletal remains showing signs of cannibalism <em>combined</em> with his artwork depicting cannibalism is probably enough to convince most juries that he was responsible for the deaths.</p>

<p>It sounds like you believe that you must have proof that <em>someone</em> committed a crime, like a dead body, before you start an investigation. That&#39;s not the case at all. </p>

<p>Just look at something like IRS criminal tax investigators, who can come after you because you live in a million dollar house and work at McDonald&#39;s. They don&#39;t have to prove <em>someone</em> made a million dollars selling drugs and to tie it to the McDonald&#39;s employee.</p>

<p>In other words, no, you don&#39;t &quot;need to find a crime before investigating evidence&quot;</p>

<p>Not at all. There is absolutely no danger in objectively evaluating evidence. There is a lot of danger in refusing to examine evidence of child abuse. Ask anyone who was raped by a Catholic priest and experienced stone-walling because the abusers had key positions of power in the church.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s because the rules relating to a trial are the <em>most</em> strict out of anything in the are of criminal procedure. </p>

<p>When you&#39;re deciding whether or not to start an investigation, there are no rules of evidence at all. Generally, as long as you&#39;re not using evidence illegally collected by the government, or starting an investigation for an expressly illegal purpose (like because someone is a minority), you can start an investigation on nothing but a hunch. For example, if a cop thinks someone looks funny, they can walk over and ask them questions.</p>

<p>The level of evidence required is higher when you start talking about things like pulling someone over or demanding ID (reasonable suspicion) or searching someone&#39;s home (probable cause). But you don&#39;t need to have any of this to initiate an investigation. </p>

<p>Obamas’ Next Home: 9 Bedrooms in a Wealthy Washington Neighborhood</p>

<p>“<em>It’s a very quiet neighborhood; that’s part of the reason why all of us like it there,</em>” said <em>Tony Podesta</em>, a well-connected Democratic lobbyist and brother of John D. Podesta, Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman.</p>

<p>Mr. Podesta, who lives two doors from the house the Obamas will rent, <em>invites neighbors for pizza parties in his backyard, where he has a pizza oven</em>. Several times a day, a line of parked taxis snakes down the street, their occupants drawn to the Islamic Center on the block for Muslim prayers.</p>

<p>the MSM is CIA/Deep State and the CIA will control people however distastefully they need to do so.  The CIA has an atrocious history of what the org will do.  From Mossadegh to Viet-Nam to inner-city crack to 9/11, it seems the CIA&#39;s moral boundaries are pretty maleable.  There&#39;s little reason to think the CIA <strong>isn&#39;t</strong> mixed up in child trafficking and sating pedos.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In addition to the wikileaks proof that Tony Podesta remained friends with Hastert, here&#39;s some more info for you on the Podestas&#39; relationship with &quot;Denny&quot; Hastert.</p>

<p>From <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1497611">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1497611</a></p>

<p><em>Tony Podesta<br/>
Tony Podesta, John Podesta&#39;s brother and the guy who has a &quot;pasta&quot; obsession according to many e-mails did a 3 to 4 month trip to Japan with Dennis Hastert where they both taught students. In his first year of graduate school, Hastert spent three months in Japan as part of the People to People Student Ambassador Program.[29] One of Hastert&#39;s fellow group members was Tony Podesta (then the president of the Young Democrats at University of Illinois at Chicago Circle).<br/>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Hastert">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Hastert</a><br/>
Hastert admitted to molesting kids when he did work as a teacher.<br/>
<a href="http://archive.is/h6Xwl">http://archive.is/h6Xwl</a><br/>
Tony Podesta still keeps in regular contact with Hastert.<br/>
<a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/48488">https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/48488</a></em></p>

<p>From <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1645566/8041824">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1645566/8041824</a></p>

<p><em>This is from the Chicago Mag Interview: Politico’s Glenn Thrush says that your brother can have a “short fuse;” that he has “a sulfuric evil twin [named SKIPPY] so fearsome that even the brash Rahm Emanuel scrambled for cover.”I think that John has high standards. And I think that the people who worked for him in the White House and people who worked for him at CAP love and respect him. He has moments when people disappoint. He sometimes can make that clear. And just for Gits &amp; Shiggles Tony Says: Are there other people from Chicago who went on to run for office whom you knew when you lived here, went to school here?I went to college with Denny Hastert, Carol Moseley Braun, and Steve Schiff, who became a Republican congressman from Albuquerque, New Mexico. We were all in student government at the U of I. In 1965, Hastert and I were part of a two-month student delegation to Japan. We traveled around the country, taught at an English camp for two weeks, met with local YMCA leaders. We were there for the 20th anniversary of the bombing of Hiroshima. Hastert was not like Clinton or Rahm. I did not see the seed of political power. We’re still friends. I knew him when he was Speaker. His personality has not changed at all from 1965 to 2013. He’s a decent, wonderful guy. People like and respect him. I was surprised to see him elected to Congress, but, once there, I was not surprised to see him become Speaker of the House.</em>
<em>HE SAYS ABOUT HASTERT: He&#39;s a decent wonderful guy. Has not changed at all. Whoa!</em></p>

<p>From <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/clinton/stories/podesta093098.htm">http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/clinton/stories/podesta093098.htm</a></p>

<p><em>&quot;My feeling is that John has a good moral point of view -- and he certainly has a tough job to do,&quot; says Rep. Denny Hastert (R-Ill.), the chief deputy Republican whip and an old college pal of Podesta&#39;s brother Tony (the Podestas grew up in Chicago). &quot;He&#39;s tried to do it with as much dignity and honesty as he could possibly bring forward.&quot;</em></p>

<p>Hastert even wrote about Podesta and their time together in Japan in his book <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=k_maI6BGFA0C&amp;amp;pg=PT33">https://books.google.com/books?id=k_maI6BGFA0C&amp;amp;pg=PT33</a></p>

<ul>
<li>Tony Podesta, president of the Young Democrats at the University of Illinois (Chicago Circle), was a member of our group. We didn&#39;t see eye-to-eye politically, but the trip was interesting. During my nearly three months there, I really fell in love with Japanese culture. We were part of a People to People program…</li>

    <div class="md"><p>Been learning a lot about this Moloch stuff lately. Jeffrey Epstein of pedo island fame apparently has some kind of &quot;temple&quot; looking thing on his island with owl statues. (There are drone photos of said temple). Owls are a symbol of Moloch. From this followed finding out about &quot;Bohemian Grove&quot;, which I had never heard about previously. Apparently the world&#39;s power players all gather in the Northern CA woods for a creepy ass culty gathering once a year? Some kind of Moloch thing involved there as well. All this of course is completely legit. Nothing to see here.</p>

When I saw these pieces of &quot;art&quot; though it made me a bit nauseous.

    <div class="md"><p>I found an article about the photo you mentioned, it&#39;s got the photo just highly pixelated. The photographer defends her photo, and explains her reasoning. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2001/mar/13/childprotection">https://www.theguardian.com/society/2001/mar/13/childprotection</a></p>

<p>Honestly, they were overseas at a beach where nude kids are the norm. I&#39;m an American, but I also realize that nudity isn&#39;t bad which seems to be what she believes too.. most of the world doesn&#39;t see nudity as inherently sexual, but that&#39;s something I see a lot of Americans communicate. I think it&#39;s mostly the religious type who&#39;ve been taught nudity is wrong.</p>

<p>If you read the article, I&#39;m curious if you still see it the same way, after seeing how the mother explains it. She even mentioned she&#39;d never take pictures of they were making suggestive poses, which I think is important.</p>

<p>Is nudity inherently sexual? I didn&#39;t get that vibe from that picture, seems more like innocence to me, which is what the art critics made mention of as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No nudity is not wrong, nudity is not sexual. Those pictures shouldn&#39;t bother anybody or turn them on, but we live in a world where paedophiles and rapists are rampant, so we need to protect children from this bahaviour.</p>

<p>My parents have plenty of polaroids of me and my siblings naked, up until age of 6 or 7. Now of course they were only capturing memories, its normal. But those pics never went up online or been shown to everyone, so thats fine. </p>

<p>But now with the use of internet this material can be wide spread, it can end up in the wrong hands. I&#39;m really glad the kids are wearing masks, I can see she is a sensible enough photographer to protect them. But it only takes one sicko who sees the photos and decides to track the kids down, which is very easy now with all social media profiles and personal information stored online. Slim chance of it happening of course, but deffinitely not impossible.</p>

<p>Is that a joke? Because it absolutely would not. I&#39;ve got friends who&#39;ve done and sold hard drugs.

<p>Do you people actually read the Podesta emails?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was not his brother, it was A. Jake Siewart. Podesta didn&#39;t even reapond to the email. The entirety of Pizzagate is centered on people claiming John Podesta is using &quot;pizza codes&quot; in his emails and yet Pizzagaters haven&#39;t found a single &quot;code email&quot; written by him. So now they are falsely attributing other emails to him. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a list of people from a camp Tony Podesta has had contact with over the past 50 YEARS. He never refers to Hastert as a friend in that email, or any email. He also never he has says he stayed in contact with Hastert after his arrest, considering this email was written only 3 days after his indictment.</p>

<p>Dennis Hastert was speaker for Bill Clinton and GB, and THERE ARE WIKILEAKS DISCUSSING HOW JP KNEW HE WAS GUILTY and how he should escape to a &quot;remote Japanese island&quot;.

    <div class="md"><p>Eh I will say if there&#39;s <em>anything</em> to him knowing about the crimes of this other guy that may be something.

<p>But maybe possibly knowing about a crime is a <strong>completely</strong> different matter than being plausibly accused of it yourself or any type of art you have. </p>

<p>Yes, people are still listening to Chris Brown. Ever listened to Miles Davis, cause he beat his wife too. </p>

<p>Michael Jackson is, without question, the most prolific and influential musician in the last 100 years by creating the pop genre. </p>

<p>He did a lot of weird shit with kids. </p>

<p>None of what he did changed the impact his music had on the world. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>can you back up that the arch of hysteria is dahmer&#39;s victims pose? it looks like an exaggerated representation of someone having an orgasm honestly... and there&#39;s also one in a gallery in Canada. also, was that a video of an art exhibition at his house or something? do you have proof he set it up / it&#39;s connected to him?</p>

<h1></h1>

<p>the child &quot;groping&quot; picture doesn&#39;t seem to out of the ordinary on it&#39;s own... isn&#39;t really groping</p>

<h1></h1>

<p>but yeah, the dennis hastert email is very hard to explain. as is the torture room email... people say things like that as a joke (like maybe if it were an exercise room or something?) but in the context of everything else, it&#39;s unnerving.</p>

<h1></h1>

<p>the dead-ish kids in the marsh is also unnerving, especially in the context of everything</p>

<h1></h1>

<p>that other art (that he doesn&#39;t own) is totally fucked up and looks like a recreation of actual sexual abuse</p>

<p>4: Anna Gaskell, who is the artist responsible for the pantie-groping picture has this on her Wikipedia:  </p>

<p>&quot;In her photographic series, hide, Gaskell references a lesser-known Brothers Grimm tale, &quot;The Magic Donkey.&quot;[11] This series features young girls alone in a gothic mansion, creating a sense of dread and underlying sexual intrigue that takes its impetus from the tale of a young woman forced to hide beneath animal skins to hide from the matrimonial desires of her father.[9] The name of the series is drawn from the children&#39;s game hide-and-seek, the dual personality of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, and the literal skin, or hide, that creates a boundary between the inside and the outside, the self and the other.[12]&quot;</p>

<p>Even if this guy has the creepiest art in the world in his house, there is no victim or evidence of crime. People here feel that his taste in art is evidence enough that he&#39;s has to be molesting children.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s the thing with this information you and op provide, you can&#39;t deduce a single thing other than a) you and op don&#39;t like the podesta&#39;s taste in art. That&#39;s your opinion, but I don&#39;t recall anyone ever anointing you or op the morality police of artistic expression. You have no right to accuse someone of pedophile simply because you don&#39;t like their taste in art. Are you also accusing the artists who produced the works that the podesta&#39;s collect of pedophile, too? I admit that not all of it is my personal taste, but nothing this post has shown make my mind jump to accusations of pedophile. In fact it&#39;s a bit disturbing and perhaps unfortunately telling to me that seeing that art automatically makes you think of sexually exploiting children. That&#39;s scary. Too be honest, I think the work of the artist Patricia Piccinini is quite awesome and weird. If I ever got a chance to see her work in person exhibited some place near me, I&#39;d definitely go. But, this isn&#39;t the first time you self righteous morality warriors have accused artists of various forms of degeneracy. The artist Sally Mann produced a photographic series in which she documented her daughters growing up and being children. She has a photo of her four year old being naked and doing what four year olds do. Of course the self proclaimed, &quot;religious warrior&quot; Pat Robertson accused the artist of exploitation, suggesting child pornography. Here is the thing though, for a majority of us normal people, there is nothing sexual in any way about a four year old even if they are naked. They are just a little kid without clothes. Little kids run around naked all the time. They are innocent and haven&#39;t developed society&#39;s shame toward the human body yet. To look at something like that and automatically have your brain jump to exploitation and pedophile is disturbing to me. B) op suggests that because the Podesta&#39;s knew and had a relationship with Dennis Hassert it would be logical to assume that they too are child molesters. Are you also accusing every other person who has ever known the convicted republican pedophile of also being child molesters? Because if you apply that logic to the podesta&#39;s you have to apply it to anyone Hassert had a relationship with and I&#39;m guessing that is quite a lot of individuals. Then op posts an email in which an individual  sugests to John podesta that the convicted republican child molester might need to run off to Japan. The same supposed Wikileaks Page also includes a blurb that shows that the day after the email was sent individuals testified that Hastert had molested them. It also has a partial highly zoomed in email that says what might be sexual allegations, but that email is dated the day after the first one and shows no addresses to prove that it was sent by our received by a podesta. Also, in May of 2015 Hastert has been indicted in bank structure fraud. It is easy to assume that is what the individual writing to podesta is referring to that because even though the first testimonial accusations against the convicted republican pedophile were made the day after the email was sent, the charges weren&#39;t brought up until October of 2016. I don&#39;t see any evidence that anyone involved in that email correspondence were privy to the knowledge of the testimonials the day before or even day of them occurring. Usually the prosecution is pretty tight lipped on things of that nature. So unless you are accusing everyone who ever knew Hastert of being in on his sexual abuse or perhaps you know of more information that the rest of us don&#39;t have access to, I don&#39;t see how one can deduce a connection that one is also a pedophile simply because they knew someone who was convicted of being one. Do you and op have a relationship with Hastert? Did you know he was a pedophile? Why didn&#39;t you alert the proper authorities? Sounds like aiding and abetting to me. C) I believe it was you, but it might have been op suggest that one should be concerned of supposed pedophilia because Tony Podesta is a high powered lobbyist with a lot of influence. Again, are you also accusing all high powered lobbyists in DC as being pedophiles because their are quite a few high powered lobbyists in the capital. If I am going to deduce that one could be a pedophile because of the level of his career and influence, should not I also deduce that all are also? D) I didn&#39;t touch on this one before, but I will know. Op links to a thread on another site that accuses the uncle of the podesta&#39;s of also being a pedophile. Yet, and maybe I missed it, there is no proof of evidence to the accusation. It&#39;s nothing more than hearsay. Now should I deduce that anyone making accusations against anyone even with out proper evidence should be believed? Again, I&#39;m not arguing for or against the innocence of either of these men. I just don&#39;t think that you can deduce anything based on the supposed evidence you provide. Sure you can &quot;theorize&quot; all you want, but without any more concrete evidence al you are doing is speculating and if we are going to speculate I could theorize that both you and op are also pedophiles.I&#39;m not accusing you of being pedophiles, but I&#39;m not not accusing you of being pedophiles. It just that the fact that you both view art and automatically start thinking of child molestation and you have seemingly inside knowledge of the knowledge the podesta&#39;s had of hasterts child molestation exploitations suggest that you too, may have also known hastert and I am deducing that you too knew of his crimes before the general public. That&#39;s disturbing. Perhaps others in this thread could dig into your lives to see what we can find so we can all make our own deductions and Theorize our own views on your pedophilia. I&#39;ll leave it up to everyone else to make up their own minds on your pedophilia. Just food for thought, eh? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You seem to have mislead yourself here. My point from the beginning wasn&#39;t about pedophilia accusations, but rather giving you my intuitive outlook on approaching the matter (in defense OP&#39;s evidence from your full dismissal of the evidence/red flags). Furthermore, you have mentioned correlation does not always equal causation, we can all agree with that but to dismiss the evidence and subsequent theory entirely isn&#39;t objective. The consensus most people have is the argument you&#39;re debating towards (as I haven&#39;t disclosed my conclusions thus far). I find OP had more to say than just someone&#39;s art, it is the entire profile of the individual that creates the conspiracy. The scope of corruption being displayed in the current political climate is why these posts are popping up more often than not.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>And I&#39;m saying your so called &quot;theorization&quot; is nothing more the speculation and your so called evidence is nothing but conjecture. You have no proof of knowledge that either man knew of Hastert&#39;s molestation. Op provides accusations that an uncle was a pedophile without any actual evidence. You attest that his position of influence should certainly raise a red flag without giving any solid reason as to why. You provide no real evidence that this man is a pedophile other than the fact that <strong>viewing his art work makes you think of child molestation</strong>. That, to me, is more telling of you and op than it is of the people who created the art or collected the art. Sorry, but put up some actual evidence that this man or his brother are pedophiles. What you present now isn&#39;t objective. In fact it&#39;s the opposite of objective reasoning. It&#39;s completely subjective. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You missed my point then, the reasons why theories like those pop up is because we&#39;ve heard of people in higher positions abuse their power. Who knows what resource they have at their disposal, using money and influence to suit their agenda.

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s all subjective reasoning. To say that there have been people in positions of power have been known to abuse their power and then use that to jump to the conclusion that we should consider the possibility that someone else in a position of power could be a pedophile isn&#39;t objective reasoning. You keep bringing up the fact that the podesta&#39;s know Hastert as if that logically means they, too, could be pedophiles, but like I said before if you apply that thinking to one person, you have to apply it to anyone who knows Hastert. Are you suggesting everyone who knew Hastert should be considered or &quot;theorized&quot; a possible pedophile? What about people who know the people who know Hastert? Should they, too, be considered possible pedophiles? If you argue that someone who knows a pedophile could also be a pedophile it would be logical to then assume that anyone who knows that person is also a potential pedophile. Keep applying that logic and you have to consider anyone and everyone as a maybe pedophile. Now you bring up Manafort as a reason why one should consider that the podestas could be pedophiles, but unless you have some insider information, I have never heard of him being accused of or investigated regarding pedophilia. Tony podesta&#39;s lobbying firm is being investigated regarding their relationship with manafort and a pro Russian Ukrainian group. The is no objective reason there to suggest that you should also consider the guy a pedophile. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel like someone needs to stand up for the artists here. 
Art is often subversive as it acts like a mirror forcing society to have a good look at themselves. Visual artists much like film makers are telling stories and some of those stories are hard to stomache but important none the less, if you took stock of art throughout the ages you’d find that a lot of it (besides portraits) are grotesque.
And maybe one of those artists were inspired by crime scene photos, but that is the job of the artist, to find beauty where others dont and use it to create.
predetory behaviour is abhorent but so is war and yet if he had art work of gory war feilds no one would be upset.
Also you clearly cherry picked pieces that suited your argument and ignored all the other art work he owns.
I dont know weather he has done the things you say he has but i know for sure that his artwork and pizza parties dont make him a guilty person. Please try to stay objective</p>

All I am saying is that if you are going to levy a claim that serious against someone I think you should present more concrete proof other than three things that could appear odd but offer no direct links to your claim. </p>
