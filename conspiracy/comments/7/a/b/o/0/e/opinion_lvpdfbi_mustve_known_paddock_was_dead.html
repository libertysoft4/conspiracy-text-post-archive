        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I felt it important to qualify this post as opinion as there&#39;s been SO many fake news blogs being posted. Sadly, this tragedy has pretty much fallen out of the news. And, who can blame them? NOTHING is being released. Only stories of no news. That along with the NYC shooting, Kevin Spacey, etc. is newer and &quot;flashier&quot;. </p>

<p>Sorry... Anyway, maybe this has been pointed out on here. I feel like we&#39;ve gone over just about everything. But, as I was reading that Yahoo! article I thought about this: </p>

<p>&quot;Police did not breach Paddock’s room until 11:20 p.m. —more than an hour later — where they found him dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound.&quot;</p>

<p>WTF? LEO MUST have known Paddock was dead. Or, they were communicating with him. Lombardo said they took so long to breach because it had become a &quot;barricade&quot; situation. But, whats to say Paddock wouldn&#39;t have just picked up one of his 33 guns and shot more people? </p>

<p>I guess LE could&#39;ve <em>assumed</em> he was dead. But, uh, that seems like a pretty steep assertion. Based on the fact, at that point, no one knew he wasn&#39;t using automatic weapons. Why would they take the chance he wouldn&#39;t take out 50 more people? He was going to kill himself anyway! But, LE is psychic I guess. </p>

<p>So, why the hour wait? Was there really an hour wait? Did Paddock just decide to announce he was about to commit suicide? Or, did the FBI/LVPD know more? Quite frankly, I don&#39;t think 10-15 minutes to find the shooter is all that bad. But an entire HOUR to go in there? </p>

<p>Perhaps I&#39;m dense, but doesn&#39;t this seem hinky? Is this exactly what the article is questioning? Am I really late to the party in posting this?!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your opinion is valid and supported by the weird inconsistencies of the changing narrative.</p>

<p>At one point in the press conferences, Week 1, LVPD said that the delay in breaching the room was to await the arrival of SWAT members who had the equipment and know-how to breach the room. Then the four breaching LEO go on the news for an interview and lo and behold, they are not SWAT. </p>

<p>Another Redditor pointed out in another post that since none of the four mentioned discharging a weapon, they lied or there was another breacher with them, which was also not mentioned IIRC. </p>

<p>Weapon discharges have to written up. There is no way on earth this is new news to LVPD.</p>

<p>Argh, the delay makes no sense at all, from a commonsense, law-abiding standpoint. All that makes sense at this point is someone was cleaning up the crime scene.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right, right. I saw that on the Lombardo interview. Still...doesn&#39;t make sense. Unless they knew for sure he was dead, how did they know he wouldn&#39;t start shooting again? </p>

<p>I have been thinking about it and the only plausible answer I can come up with is that they used a scope of some kind to see in the DARK room or infrared glasses. I have no clue how those work. Would you be able to see into that suite from so far away that high up? Because, I can&#39;t imagine infrared glasses would be effective in the hallway.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also worth noting: </p>

<p>The paramedics and other &quot;first&quot; responders did not go into the venue to help the victims because scene was not secure. </p>

<p>So in a world where this shooting was not a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64xowjY3meQ">hoax</a>, waiting to breech surely cost lives by delaying rescue efforts for an hour. </p>

<p>On the flipside, if it was a hoax, this delay in first responders allowed the actors more time to setup the scene, take their videos, and raise the death count. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can do a lot in an hour if you ask me and have it pre planned.</p>

<p>Like plant evidence, remove a gun from the crime scene, (if this was from the government) what&#39;s not to say they used this time to also remove the possible other shooter(s)?. </p>

<p>So many gaps in this yet no traction at all. And this is just all hypothetical hearsay.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure what happened and feel like we will never be told 100% what happened, due to the fact itll be a domestic &quot;threat to national security&quot; because it implicates the government.</p>
