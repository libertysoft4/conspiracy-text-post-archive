    <div class="md"><p>Brochacho, I only commented here because I really wanted to throw that article in HBombthrow&#39;s face. It&#39;s not meant to be a commentary on Trump or on your thread. I just read the article this morning, LoL&#39;d at having confirmation of something I&#39;ve been telling people for well over a year, and went to his userpage because I&#39;ve seen him shitting on the idea that the primary was rigged (and other such conspiracies) all year. I saw him shillin&#39; against accusations of impropriety in <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> during the primary and I saw him come here afterwards. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Trump would not have won if it weren&#39;t for the influence/rigging by Russia.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Trump would not have won if the DNC had not conspired to elevate his position within the RNC primary, and he also would not have won if the DNC had not conspired to elevate Hillary&#39;s position as well. Bernie would have absolutely trashed Trump, and we&#39;d finally have a president not beholden to financial or industrial oligarchs. But alas. </p>

<p>Anyway I really don&#39;t want to argue with you, because like I said, I really just wanted to throw that article in that dude&#39;s face. I picked this post because it provided me easy enough context to reply and have it somewhat make sense. </p>
