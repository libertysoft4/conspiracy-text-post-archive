To get round the problem, he and his wife have excavated a huge subterranean vault beneath their house outside Washington - a white space 5m square and 4m high in which it will be possible to show &quot;very complicated video pieces&quot; on all four walls.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Makes perfect sense.</p>

<p>Breitbart accused Podesta of covering up sex slaves and then mysteriously died over a year later. Clearly Podesta had him killed.</p>

<p>Podesta knows Alefantis who owns a pizza shop and posted a picture of a kid restrained to a table. Meanwhile a different pizza shop uses a spiral in their logo and spirals are a symbol that pedophiles used on jewelry and hand-written notes, so obviously that means Alefantis is a pedophile sex trafficker and Podesta is covering for him.</p>

<p>The connections are obvious and logical. No one can deny this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Both Tony Podesta and James Alefantis were working on underground projects. Funny how Alefantis uses #killroom and Podesta mentions torture chamber. Funny how they&#39;re both into weird art featuring kids. Way too many coincidences for a group of regular guys. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know right, it&#39;s like when you take someone&#39;s comment of &quot;#killroom&quot; on Alefantis&#39; photograph and say that Alefantis said it himself and then take the phrase &quot;torture chamber&quot; from an unrelated e-mail from John Podesta and put them in the same sentence then the whole thing really becomes clear. Plus they like weird artwork, that proves it.</p>

<p>Coincidences prove it, too, because coincidences are impossible. The more coincidences you have, the more proven it becomes. That&#39;s just math.</p>

<p>He went to a Spirit Cooking dinner. Another one was described on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/maihudson/marina-abramovic-institute-the-founders">this kickstarter page</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[LIVE EVENT / THE EXERCISES: SPIRIT COOKING WITH MARINA ABRAMOVIC] A dinner night with Marina during which she will teach you and other backers at this level how to cook a series of traditional soups, which you will all enjoy together. The night will end with the making of a golden ball, a recipe given to Marina in a Tibetan monastery. Marina will bring to this dinner a Spirit Cooking memento for each backer to keep. PLUS MAI and OMA office tour, Neuroscience Exclusives, OMA / MAI Digital Design Package, Complete Abramovic Method Exclusives, access to ALL $25 live stream exercises / live events, MAI 101 Lecture and Digital Booklet, MAI Founder (CHAMBER FOUNDER), Digital MAI rewards, and The Embrace rewards.</p>

<p>The same guy who has portraits of infants in diapers in his house. The same guy that gets &quot;wired&quot; around kids.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>OMG a diaper! OMG he&#39;s &quot;wired&quot; (whatever that means)! Are you serious?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The same guy who literally has an underground chamber in his house.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In other words, he has a basement movie theater, albeit one with four screens. One that he showed to more than one journalist and invited photographers in because it was such a secret. And when people read about it in these articles, they marched on Washington and wrote letters to the editors, demanding ... Oh, no wait, they didn&#39;t do anything. Because there&#39;s nothing at all suspicious about having a movie theater.</p>

<p>And it&#39;s actually a picture of a little kid being groped around the groin with a diaper or a number of panties on. I don&#39;t know about your household are preferences, but if a friend of mine had that hung up in his house I&#39;d get major creeper vibes. Here&#39;s the pic. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, back in 1996 and 1997, there was <a href="http://imgur.com/a/mqcK1">Spirit Cooking — etchings collected in a limited edition book</a> (from <a href="http://www.editionjs.com/img/abramovic/">http://www.editionjs.com/img/abramovic/</a>  or <a href="https://www.moma.org/collection/works/portfolios/143945?locale=en">MoMA</a>)</p>

<p>And there was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EsJLNGVJ7E">Spirit Cooking — the exhibit and performance art</a>. Originally in Ghent, Belgium, but the video is from Italy.</p>

<p>Obviously she named the Spirit Cooking dinner after that work. But if people paid $10,000 expecting dinner and they show up only to be handed buckets of blood to paint on the walls, they&#39;re going to want their money back.</p>

<p>The &quot;recipes&quot; in the Spirit Cooking are not actually things you eat. Here&#39;s the text:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some art is meant to provoke and push boundaries. Back  when I first moved to New York there was a show called Shock (or something similar) that featured a photo of a crucifix soaking in the artist&#39;s urine. A lot of people were outraged. But we are lucky to live in a free society where people can express themselves in outrageous ways. And you&#39;re free to ignore it if you don&#39;t like it. </p>

<p>Marina is an interesting artist with a long career; she once did a show at MoMa where she sat in a chair and visitors sat in another chair opposite her. They simply looked at each other. There&#39;s a photo book of this piece; it&#39;s interesting to see the range of reactions produced by this simple concept. </p>

<p>Personally I don&#39;t respond to this Spirit Cooking piece so much, but if she wants to paint with blood and jizz, what&#39;s the big deal?</p>

The Washington Post has removed an article in which Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta’s “art” collection was revealed to contain pictures of naked teenagers. The 2004 article, archived online, includes comments from former Clinton administration official Sally Katzen in which she discusses the “awkwardness” of being at the Podesta’s home. “At political events, there’s an inevitable awkwardness,” Katzen said. The article’s author goes on to mention the disturbing specifics of the Podestas’ taste in “art.” “Folks attending a house tour in the Lake Barcroft neighborhood in Falls Church earlier this year got an eyeful when they walked into a bedroom at the Podesta residence hung with multiple color pictures by Katy Grannan, a photographer known for documentary-style pictures of naked teenagers in their parents’ suburban homes.”</p>

<p><a href="https://archive.fo/vddrO">https://archive.fo/vddrO</a>
The Washington Post has removed an article in which Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta’s “art” collection was revealed to contain pictures of naked teenagers. The 2004 article, archived online, includes comments from former Clinton administration official Sally Katzen in which she discusses the “awkwardness” of being at the Podesta’s home. “At political events, there’s an inevitable awkwardness,” Katzen said. The article’s author goes on to mention the disturbing specifics of the Podestas’ taste in “art.” “Folks attending a house tour in the Lake Barcroft neighborhood in Falls Church earlier this year got an eyeful when they walked into a bedroom at the Podesta residence hung with multiple color pictures by Katy Grannan, a photographer known for documentary-style pictures of naked teenagers in their parents’ suburban homes.”</p>

<p>There are bigger fish to fry. All this stuff about pizzagate, etc simply obfuscates the real story which is Uranium 1, the Clinton Foundation, and Obama’s State Department. What the fuck is the story there? Plenty!! And I want to know more. </p>
