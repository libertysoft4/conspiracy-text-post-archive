<p>&quot;Psychopathy has been associated with amorality—an absence of, indifference towards, or disregard for moral beliefs. There are few firm data on patterns of moral judgment. Studies of developmental level (sophistication) of moral reasoning found all possible results—lower, higher or the same as non-psychopaths. Studies that compared judgments of personal moral transgressions versus judgments of breaking conventional rules or laws found that psychopaths rated them as equally severe, whereas non-psychopaths rated the rule-breaking as less severe.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>George Soros has been conclusively proven to fund <a href="http://www.larouchepub.com/pr/2017/Xproof%20Nazis%20in%20Ukraine.pdf">Nazis</a> in Ukraine (he&#39;s Jewish by the way, if it&#39;s possible to make that <em>more</em> morally reprehensible). </p>

<p>Three years ago this week, a Molotov-cocktail-throwing mob on the streets of Kiev occupied government  buildings,  perpetrating  violence  and  driving  the duly elected president of the nation out of office and out of the country. The leading groups in the mob were waving portraits of Stepan Bandera, Adolf Hitler’s col-
laborator in Ukraine during World War II...</p>

<p>Obama’s direct agent for the coup, Assistant Secretary of State 
for  European  and  Eurasian  Affairs,  Victoria  Nuland, visited the rioters several times, handing out cookies on the Maidan, while refusing to acknowledge that in addition to peaceful demonstrators concerned about corruption and economic hardships, there were also openly neo-fascist  gangs  conducting  an  armed  insurrection<br/>
against the elected government.</p>

<p>Nuland was also caught by a phone tap instructing the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine on precisely who was to be made Prime Minister in the new government, after the President was toppled.&quot;</p>

<p>Soros is an extension of the US State Department, and a long-proven deep state actor, subverting elected governments and installing tyrants. I&#39;m not sure why you think he&#39;s incapable of paying internet shills when we know he donated money to groups that paid internet shills during the last election.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You make a good point about the Koch brothers, who have a [private intelligence agency](<a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/the-koch-brothers-intelligence-agency-215943):">www.politico.com/story/2015/11/the-koch-brothers-intelligence-agency-215943):</a></p>

<p>&quot;The operation, which is little-known even within the Koch network, gathers what Koch insiders refer to as “competitive intelligence” that is used to try to thwart liberal groups and activists, and to identify potential threats to the expansive network.</p>

<p>The competitive intelligence team has a staff of 25, including one former CIA analyst, and operates from one of the non-descript Koch network offices clustered near the Courthouse metro stop in suburban Arlington, Va. It has provided network officials with documents detailing confidential voter-mobilization plans by major Democrat-aligned groups. It also sends regular “intelligence briefing” emails tracking the canvassing, phone-banking and voter-registration efforts of labor unions, environmental groups and their allies, according to documents reviewed by POLITICO and interviews with a half-dozen sources with knowledge of the group.&quot;</p>

<p>People pay attention to Soros because he does things like <a href="http://www.larouchepub.com/eiw/public/2017/eirv44n08-20170224/04-21_4408.pdf">overthrow</a> elected governments and replace them with Nazis, and he&#39;s been doing it for several decades. He is quite literally an extension of the US State Department, which works heavily with the CIA to pull off coups.</p>

<p>It&#39;s because the less sophisticated shilling outfits would hire a bunch of college students at minimum wage and wouldn&#39;t even bother spending the money to buy up old reddit accounts, so they were forced to create brand new accounts en masse, leading to noticeable &quot;batches&quot; of accounts all saying the same things.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hello, I’m actually the user who compiled that evidence and i didn’t start out meaning to target one side. In fact I found one instance of copying behavior and followed a trail of interconnected users doing the same thing. I suspect similar behavior in <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> but think it’s too late for them and it would be too hard to track using the methods I used here, which were admittedly pretty simple. </p>

<p>My methods were first to notice low effort political (more and more screenshots) posts. OP usually comments just once and does not greatly engage with other users. Go to otherdiscussions tab and notice that they are cross posting from t-d (it was always t-d) and that they copied the title almost word for word, and furthermore, copied a high level comment from one of the users. Then go to find that every post in their history is like that. </p>

<p>It’s possible that the other side is doing something similar here but I think they’re mostly already banned or downvotes and they don’t have such sensationalist headlines as the Donald so it’s harder to spot. I was ALWAYS able to find that the OPs I listed had copied a comment. I kept finding them because they almost solely engaged with one another. At this point they’ve all gone silent. Only one is banned from here and almost no regular users of the sub had any substantial comment about the behaviors. Strange. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not possible. They <em>ARE</em> doing the same thing as you which is why I said your evidence holds no weight because they do the same thing with other subreddits. </p>

<p>You all just act like children saying, &quot;Look at what they did! See, I have evidence!&quot; and then they just turn around and say, &quot;Oh yea? Well look at what YOU did.&quot;. </p>

<p>I have to agree and disagree here. Trump is a Republican, but the Koch brothers refused to endorse him or contribute to his campaign. 
This is one source, but there are many more easy to find. </p>

<p>Are really <em>picking sides</em>? Bet you call yourself better than &quot;the others&quot;. Learn how to read and get off this binary mentality. I was agreeing with you and making fun of the claims that Soros is personally paying for bots on reddit. You are a shame for this sub. </p>

I agree that a binary isn&#39;t ideal, but this sub is overrun with people spreading the alt-right talking points du jour and it seems disingenuous to pretend that isn&#39;t happening.

It seems as if one has a more provable argument than the other, and yet only one argument relies on things like claiming proof that they totally have but just can&#39;t show you and using statements like &quot;everyone knows this happens&quot; as proof that it does</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But all that leads to using sources like WordPress websites as an authority. My personal opinion, I don&#39;t treat mainstream media or Wikipedia as sources, unless they cite a source.. and that&#39;s what I usually link to.</p>

<p>Like there&#39;s a popular post about Twitter censoring stuff, and they linked to the source, and when I read what the source actually says.. they were targeting actual bots, but the news article was claiming it was simply targeting users based on the hash tag.</p>

<p>But, the fact that the website cited a source is what&#39;s important, it allowed me to see for myself that they intensionally twisted the facts, and they are as much fake news as all the left leaning ones that do the same thing.</p>

<p>Not exactly 15 days but discussion in the thread has more sourcing of recent trends supporting OP.</p>

<p>As far as my account is concerned, I switched over from my 8+ year old main because of hostility of parties observing and brigading this sub directly targeting me.</p>

<p>*Just to add, some of the accounts attacking OP and getting disproportionate upvotes I&#39;ve had previously tagged for similar activity. Similarly, accounts trying to nonpartisanly discuss the points at hand are being downvoted barely below 0, along with upvoted character attacks as responses. This was not r/conspiracy before these people started spamming this sub with fallacies and an apparent disdain for civil discourse. </p>

That said, about 2-3 weeks after I noticed the content on the conspiracy page had changed, posts were more negative towards the op or anyone who joined to add information.. people were no longer working together and being constructive with the facts. something has changed for sure... seems like Reddit has been compromised.. what a shame!</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="https://www.salon.com/2014/02/25/is_the_us_backing_neo_nazis_in_ukraine_partner/">Nazis</a> were installed in Ukraine with the full support of the <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/ukraine-phonecall-idUSL2N0LC1E120140207">US State Department</a>. And George Soros admitted to <a href="http://www.hangthebankers.com/george-soros-admits-to-funding-the-ukraine-crisis/">bankrolling</a> the whole debacle:</p>

<p>George Soros told CNN’s Fareed Zakaria over the weekend he is responsible for establishing a foundation in Ukraine that ultimately contributed to the overthrow of the country’s elected leader and the installation of a junta handpicked by the State Department.</p>

<p>“First on Ukraine, one of the things that many people recognized about you was that you during the revolutions of 1989 funded a lot of dissident activities, civil society groups in eastern Europe and Poland, the Czech Republic. Are you doing similar things in Ukraine?” Zakaria asked Soros.</p>

<p>“Well, I set up a foundation in Ukraine before Ukraine became independent of Russia. And the foundation has been functioning ever since and played an important part in events now,” Soros responded</p>

<p>It is well-known, although forbidden for the establishment media to mention, that Soros worked closely with USAID, the National Endowment for Democracy (now doing work formerly assigned to the CIA), the International Republican Institute, the National Democratic Institute for International Affairs, the Freedom House, and the Albert Einstein Institute to initiate a series of color revolutions in Eastern Europe and Central Asia following the engineered collapse of the Soviet Union.</p>

<p>“Many of the participants in Kiev’s ‘EuroMaidan’ demonstrations were members of Soros-funded NGOs and/or were trained by the same NGOs in the many workshops and conferences sponsored by Soros’ International Renaissance Foundation (IRF), and his various Open Society institutes and foundations. The IRF, founded and funded by Soros, boasts that it has given ‘more than any other donor organization’ to ‘democratic transformation’ of Ukraine,” writes William F. Jasper.&quot;</p>

I pretty much only lurk around now even with an account lol. Most of the time I feel people already have said what I am thinking or I just don&#39;t have much to contribute. I miss the ufo stuff and all the paranormal X-Files stuff. I miss being able to go to a subreddit that didn&#39;t have anything going on related to the main stream media. I posted once about Mel&#39;s hole sorta recently. That&#39;s the shit I miss. I wonder how much new paranormal news this sub has missed because of the constant other bullshit. </p>

<p>And?</p>

<p>I delete my history constantly because people look for stupid shit.</p>

<p>So I assume some are into creating new accounts.</p>

<p>The 14 day old account argument works in other subs, but here it makes sense.  The amount of attacks from post history is amazing.</p>

<p>Anyways, what is your conspiracy?  You added nothing.  People upvoted nothing.  Good to know, wonder who upvoted you?  What did they have to do with this?</p>

<p>Seriously come on now, this is pathetic.  Provide something, not I can&#39;t provide something.  Or I won&#39;t bring anything to the table.</p>

<p>I have to agree and disagree here. Trump is a Republican, but the Koch brothers refused to endorse him or contribute to his campaign. 
This is one source, but there are many more easy to find. </p>
