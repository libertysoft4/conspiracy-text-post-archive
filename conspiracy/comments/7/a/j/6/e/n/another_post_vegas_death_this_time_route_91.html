<p>There is absolutely nothing that says he was the festival lawyer NOR Jason Aldeans.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not in the article cited, but...</p>

<p>Here is a story from The Argus Leader, which is the daily newspaper of Sioux Falls, South Dakota. The article is from July 19, 2015.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.argusleader.com/story/mattzimmer/2015/07/19/outtakes-with-jed-lance-jason-aldean-lawyer/30362445/">Outtakes with Jed Lance and Jason Aldean&#39;s lawyer</a></strong></p>

<p>The story is mostly about Jed Lance, but the author was also able to speak with Orville Almon - Jason Aldean&#39;s attorney at the time the article was written.  I&#39;m assuming he was still Aldean&#39;s attorney, but I don&#39;t know for sure.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Still, maybe the most entertaining part of working on the story was my interview with Orville Almon, the Nashville entertainment lawyer who acted as a sort of manager/agent for Jed.</p>

<p><strong>Almon is still very much active in the business today, counting Jason Aldean as one of his clients.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I tried searching to see if Almon was the Route 91 Harvest Festival attorney.</p>

<p>The concert itself wouldn&#39;t have had an attorney. People filing lawsuits are not going to be filing them against the Route 91 Harvest Festival. They&#39;d be filing them against Live Nation - the concert&#39;s promoters.</p>

<p>I did a search and found references to two law firms representing Live Nation in previous cases. One was Greenberg Traurig LLP and the other was Latham &amp; Watkins.</p>

<p>Orville Almon&#39;s law practice was called Almon &amp; Pike. I can&#39;t find any links at all between them and Live Nation.</p>

<p>So while I <em>do</em> think he was probably Aldean&#39;s lawyer, I don&#39;t think he was a lawyer for Live Nation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly kudos to you for digging that deep. I couldn’t find anything that led me to believe he was a lawyer for either party, but go figure he was for Jason Aldean. However, I fail to see how this would lead to added suspicion in the story. If the lawyer had been seen making accusations of multiple gunmen/conflicting the narrative I could see it, but it honestly just seems like an old guy in a stress full job passed away to me. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>And keep in mind Almon was an entertainment lawyer  not q criminal lawyer..  He would have been the one to draw up contracts, etc. </p>

<p>Minor correction here.  Almon&#39;s law firm used to be called Almon &amp; <strong>Mc</strong>Pike but I guess McPike retired or left and effective February of 2017 it was renamed Alom Law according to the firms twitter account.</p>

<p>Also, and I haven&#39;t verified this, but it&#39;s my understanding that Almon was not licensed to practice law in Nevada.</p>

<p>One other thought I had is that people could sue the concert promoters (Live Nation) but they could also sue the owners of Las Vegas Village - the concert venue.</p>

<p>And who owns Las Vegas Village you might ask?</p>

<p>MGM RESORTS FESTIVAL GROUNDS LLC</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://sandgate.co.clark.nv.us/AssrRealProp/ParcelDetail.aspx?hdnParcel=16228201002&amp;amp;hdnInstance=pcl7">Source</a></strong></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://archive.is/5qqUs">Archived Link</a></strong></p>

<p>I never see the media bring that up.</p>

<p>Same company owns the hotel where the shooter allegedly was staying and the concert venue where most/all of the victims were killed.  Convenient, no?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s fine by me.  I&#39;ve posted it as a comment a couple of times but never as it&#39;s own post.</p>

<p>Keep in mind as the owners, MGM would know every square inch of that place.  Also I think I saw a vieo that proved there were at least some security cameras at the venue, yet we haven&#39;t seen anything from those.  Not expecting to see people being shot mind you, but maybe some shots before the shootings showing what areas of the venue could be seen.</p>

<p>You wanna make a post out of it?  Go for it.</p>
