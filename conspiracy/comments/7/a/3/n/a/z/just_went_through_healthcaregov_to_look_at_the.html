    <div class="md"><p>Free markets can work, and socialist programs can work. These two things are not opposites, they&#39;re not mutually exclusive. There are situations in which socialist programs make far more sense than letting the market run its course, and vise versa. If all you have is a hammer, every problem will look like a nail to you. Unfortunately, when it comes to economic policy, not every problem will be a nail. Sometimes you need a screwdriver. Different tools, as different problems require different solutions. You could address every problem in the world with a free market or socialist solution one way or the other, but you&#39;d miss a lot of opportunities to more efficiently solve a lot of problems.</p>

Set aside the economic arguments over it all, and think about all of the extreme horseshit the government has been responsible for over the last fifty years, bs that is exposed over and over again in here.

<p>I don&#39;t believe the drug companies spend nearly as much money on advertisements in those countries (is it actually $0 since advertising isn&#39;t permitted outside the US??) for their drugs or lobbying to get regulations eased or removed.  </p>

<p>So while all these highly educated professional politicians and economists are totally confused on how to bring down the cost of healthcare I&#39;m sitting here watching $$$$ thrown at pointless ads on TV from Pfizer etc and driving past these hospitals that look more like Silicon Valley tech campuses with huge fountains and marble everywhere and just shaking my head.  Am I taking crazy pills here?</p>

<p>Much like the tax debate/student loan debate, the issue isn&#39;t the high taxes - its the inefficient manner which those tax dollars are spent.</p>

<p>Stop all the drug ads.  Hospitals should be simple buildings with quality staff and affordable care.  I don&#39;t believe this would fix the problem on it&#39;s own, but for fucks sake its a switch you could flip today and start seeing an impact immediately.  </p>

Food is another necessity but we don’t need a universal food system to ensure people get fed.

    <div class="md"><p>No, a lot of it is the fact that healthcare is actually expensive as fuck in America, and that&#39;s on healthcare facilities, physicians, pharmaceuticals, government agencies, and litigation practices. Insurance companies make as much money from malpractice insurance policies as they do from healthcare insurance policies. Pharmaceutical companies have a lack of competition because of regulations barring international competition, and a hijacked FDA designed to keep development costs too high to invite domestic competition. Healthcare facilities are forced to provide excessive care to avoid being sued, which ties back into our legislation on healthcare litigation. The whole system is fucked top to bottom. The health insurance scam was designed to keep the insanity going. The war on drugs made plenty of safe and cheap drugs completely illegal, opening up room for pharmaceutical companies to make zillions off of peddling slightly safer, patent-able versions of those drugs. Before all this bullshit compounded on itself, we had fee-for-service healthcare which worked just fine. You&#39;d go to your doctor and spend less than $10.00 in today&#39;s money for some cheap marijuana to treat your headache. Why, because it worked, and it was safe. Seriously the whole fucking industry is completely fucked and insane from top to bottom.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The ACA and universal healthcare are not the same thing, and not really a step in the same direction. How prices are capped and companies made to be competitive is different from country to country, and we should probably have an honest discussion about which systems work, and which ones don&#39;t, so we can create a system from scratch that learns from the mistakes of other countries.....</p>

<p>....but we won&#39;t. This is because doing this wouldnt benefit insurance companies, or pharmaceutical companies. It would benefit most of us, but there isnt a powerful lobbying group for most of us. Also we have propaganda that tells dumb people that universal health Care is socialism, and socialism is communism, and communism is Stalin killing millions of his own people, and then he&#39;s gonna take your guns, and put you in jail for saying merry Christmas, and black people aren&#39;t going to stand for the national anthem at football games, and you&#39;ll be forced to speak Spanish, and be gay transexual vegans and all these horrible things, all because we adopted a more cost effective healthcare plan.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Companies aren&#39;t particularly efficient either. Really, humans aren&#39;t very efficient. The government gets a bad rap for being inefficient because it&#39;s not as susceptible to change as the market, what with income being derived not from consumers choosing to buy a product, but from citizens being forced to pay taxes. You&#39;ve got to wait for election day to change a government program, but you can topple a corporation over night when you boycott. In my experience, corporations can be just as idiotic and inefficient as government organizations, and they can stay in business for decades and centuries.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Except our high healthcare costs are only partially (and very marginally) because of our private insurance companies. If I had to pick one thing to pin as the cause of our expensive healthcare, I&#39;d have to pin it on our legal system. It is easier to sue doctors in America than in any other country in the world. Likewise, physician costs in the U.S. are more expensive than in any other country in the world. It&#39;s because doctors and hospitals need to carry expansive malpractice insurance, which is incredibly expensive. It&#39;s a good idea to protect people from shitty doctors, but in America it goes well beyond that. </p>

<p>The second major source would be how excessively profit oriented our healthcare industry is. Facilities are not just built to be functional, they&#39;re built to be beautiful, luxurious even, and to have the most excessively top of the line equipment. Expensive treatments and procedures are recommended far in excess compared to other countries. This is as much a result of an effort to make money as it is to protect against lawsuits. </p>

<p>Next you have the pharmaceutical and medical technology industries. Big pharma basically has monopoly in our drug market. Domestic companies have no international competition thanks to the FDA. Medical tech companies are subject to regulations designed to protect consumers that really just protect physicians and healthcare facilities from litigation through excessive quality control.</p>

<p>The one thing these sources of inflated costs all have in common is excess, which should come as no surprise to foreigners. What can us Americans do? The industry is unanimously going forward in this direction of excess. It&#39;s not like you can change it, there&#39;s no competition you can go to that isn&#39;t ridiculously expensive for these same reasons. The culture of excess in healthcare here is uniform.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>According to polls, most people in most countries with universal healthcare seem to like it. I guess the added wait times are better than choosing between treatment and unescapable generational debt.</p>

<p>Anectdotally speaking, I&#39;m in the military so I get government healthcare and you&#39;re right the waiting times can be longer but  not 3 months longer (if they can&#39;t serve you in 30 days you get referred out in town for free). My wife and I had a difficult birth for our son, that without government healthcare would have cost us upwards of 6 million dollars, but instead we didn&#39;t have to pay a dime. I couldn&#39;t imagine having a new child and having to be saddled with that kind of debt. So I&#39;m very grateful for my government healthcare, and wish others could have it too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the current congress has had ample time to pass legislation, but hasn&#39;t been able to and the current president seems more worried about sabotaging Obama&#39;s legacy than keeping insurance costs down for average Americans. I think there&#39;s a bipartisan solution to be found and the current bipartisan bill would go a long way but I find it incredibly disappointing that the political party who&#39;s been unified in calling the current system broken couldn&#39;t come up with a way to fix it</p>

<p>Not really. Just making a case against American Health Insurance the way it is now and has been for quite awhile. If it was real insurance and just covered unexpected illness and accident than it would be closer to what insurance actually is supposed to be and it would be much more affordable imo.</p>

<p>Actually, that&#39;s called catastrophic health insurance, and it was awful. The laws were changed because they were selling that and calling it <em>actual</em> insurance, which it isn&#39;t. Technically, it never pays out, it was a scam.</p>

<p>No, it isn&#39;t. Life is inherently unfair and pretty horrible for some people. It&#39;s sad but true.</p>

<p>Is it fair to take people&#39;s money against their will? The &quot;Government&quot; didn&#39;t give you anything they didn&#39;t take. Whether that&#39;s fair or good or positive is up to interpretation, but the fact remains.</p>

<p>Requiring insurance companies to offer insurance to sick people and subsidizing the costs destroys insurance. It&#39;s like passing a law that says you have to give someone homeowners insurance after their house burned down. Sooner or later, homeowners insurance companies will be bankrupt. And then no one gets homeowners insurance because it&#39;s a guaranteed loss.</p>

<p>Obamacare either was designed to fail (what I believe) to pave the way for a single payer system (which I&#39;m not opposed to) or legislators and executive branch members don&#39;t understand basic economic principles (possible, but unlikely).</p>

<p>No, I&#39;m not a &quot;healthcare economist&quot; because that&#39;s not a thing. I have studied economics and have a degree in accounting. Legislating that businesses engage in activities to cause them to lose money is know as a &quot;perverse incentive&quot; and will eventually cause them to go out of business.

<p>Things are either fair or unfair. There&#39;s no such thing as &quot;fair to some&quot; you dolt. <em>You</em> are the one who brought up fairness, asking how high healthcare costs for someone who is born with a genetic defect is fair. It is not; and no one said it was. I&#39;m not sure who told you life should be fair, but it isn&#39;t, never has been, and never will be.</p>

<p>I honestly don&#39;t know, and I&#39;ve always just rolled the dice when I was unemployed cause that shit is expensive for sure - that&#39;s why I appreciate my employer provided insurance. </p>

<p>Why would you have a platinum policy? Those don&#39;t ever seem to make much sense when you can get a mid-range deductable plan with an out of pocket cap. A bronze plan has a 13k max out of pocket. That&#39;s probably less/month if you actually max it than your plan.</p>

<p>Our healthcare has huge problems and the ACA is far from perfect. But its far better than what proceeded and and certainly better than that piece of shit Congress tried to pass. Its totally fixable with some adjustments, but the ruling party can&#39;t do that for purely political reasons. It sucks, but here we are.</p>

<p>And bear in mind healthcare costs rise every year and have for decades. Its hard to know exactly what piece of it is responsible for what piece of the premia.</p>

<p>But you&#39;re implying it got better.

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Yes because government controlled health Care is awesome</p>

<p>Seems pretty popular in literally every country with universal health care</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I can&#39;t wait for the day America has that and can legislate who gets what treatment </p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you&#39;re suggesting Fox News esque &quot;The government will have death panels!&quot; type hysteria, I just want to point out that people are <em>already</em> being denied healthcare, only through the abstraction of being priced out of it. People are already going years without seeing doctors for easily treated conditions simply because they can&#39;t afford it. These <em>same</em> people are then costing you money anyway when they inevitably rush to the emergency room, rack up medical debt they can&#39;t pay (which will be more expensive for a <em>treatment</em> than for <em>preventative</em> care) which inevitably passes cost on to you as our for profit insurance and pharmaceutical companies adjust costs. If you don&#39;t want to &quot;pay for other people&#39;s health care&quot; you should probably drop your (private) insurance coverage anyway because <em>that&#39;s literally the point of insurance</em>. The only difference is, it being privately owned, profit is skimmed off everything for shareholders&#39; exclusive benefit, and there is an economic incentive to fuck people over for profit if necessary. </p>

<p>This isn&#39;t even going into how fucked up it is that the majority of &quot;decent&quot; health coverage in the US (except for people who already get medicare...) only receive it through their employers. Frustrated at your job? Welp better hope you don&#39;t have a medical condition that necessitates frequent health care because you&#39;re fucked if you just up and quit. From a (left)-libertarian perspective, how free can you really be under such a system? </p>

<p>Not to mention the recent push for religious legal exemptions on benefits, what happens when your employer decides they don&#39;t want to cover something? Good luck friendo, hope it&#39;s not a necessary treatment.</p>

A global oligarchy in partnership with various bourgeois instruments of the &quot;deep state&quot; i.e. the CIA et al.

<p>Yup, I noticed, and my point is &#39;I&#39;m still not sure if there is a bias being put into it&#39;.  If last year it was announce there were premium hikes (some as much as 145%), even though we were told Premiums were going to go down years ago, it makes you wonder how fucked up the system is to begin with.  Yes, Trump is to blame for not guaranteeing the subsidies for the Insurance companies, but how much of that hike is because of Trump, and how much is because they were already going to go up?  I don&#39;t exactly trust the MSM to paint an unbias picture, hence why I question it.  </p>

<p>I think taxing cigs is just the middle ground. I&#39;m sure someone somewhere ran the numbers to maximize net tax revenue adjusted for health consequences. Setting the tax right where it&#39;d maximize returns. Can&#39;t kill the tobacco industry though cause they&#39;re providing money too, a second factor to consider in the equation.

    <div class="md"><p>I had a cousin who was pregnant and she signed up for Obamacare. You&#39;d think she was the one whose house burned down, and was gaming the insurance company, right? Well, she added up her monthly payments and her deductions for 12 months. It cost just about the same as it would to deliver her kid out-of-pocket at the hospital. </p>

<p>Then there&#39;s also quality: If she were to deliver at the crappy hospital down the road (where homeless crack addicts go in the middle of the night) she would&#39;ve saved $400 and had medical interns be the one to deliver her kid. </p>

<p>What she <em>also</em> didn&#39;t know was how many doctors opted out of marketplace insurance. She&#39;d see online that they&#39;d cover united or blue cross thinking she&#39;d be fine... only to realize that there were two separate substrates of the insurance: market, and private. They usually only covered private. </p>

<p>health insurance is a scam if it covers &#39;pre-existing conditions.&#39;</p>

<p>All for-profit insurance is a scam. For the individual, you&#39;re basically gambling and betting that something bad will happen. Can you imagine going to a casino and putting down 500 bucks bet on a roulette table that you&#39;ll get deathly sick? For the company, they&#39;re motivated to refuse to pay out for anything if possible. Their ultimate goal is to take money from people repeatedly without paying anything out. Neither side of this deal seem very good, smart, fair, etc. </p>

<p>They would do that simply because people are calling for it, and their elect-ability could potentially depend on it.

Seriously, the tools used by physicians to practice healthcare are so meticulously created, you&#39;d think they were made in automated factories on a space station and shipped down to earth in a space elevator.</p>

<p>Idk if the test strips in question are or not, I was using them as an example since it was mentioned in the comment, but medical devices and supplies are absolutely manufactured completely differently for consumer use and medical use, with different quality control standards.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again I think you are missing my point. You are trying to say that strip actually costs $30 plus dollars. The fact is it costs the same as the one you buy at CVS. </p>

<p>For example a roll of sterile gauze will be billed at say 20 dollars in hospital. 
An identical roll of sterile gauze can be purchased at CVS for 10 dollars
That same roll was purchased by the hospital and CVS by the same distributor. Whom they paid at best 3 dollars for. That&#39;s the problem. </p>

<p>No I&#39;m not. I don&#39;t even know what specific product was being discussed. I was using it as an example for the difference in the cost of heavily regulated medical supplies and consumer products. I didn&#39;t know if the person above knew exactly what product was being used. They did and I later corrected myself in reply to them. My point wasn&#39;t to claim I knew exactly why that specific product cost so much more.</p>

<p>That does happen, often times though they aren&#39;t charging you for the supplies themselves, but rather for their overhead as a medical facility.</p>

<p>A lot of the time, however, hospitals are getting much higher quality supplies than what consumers are going to buy. You might be okay with $50.00 forceps, but a cardiovascular surgeon is going to have a $200.00 pair easy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are not correct sir. I have worked in healthcare for over 15 years. I have worked in the supply side of it for 2 years. </p>

<p>A forcep is a forcep in a hospital. The same ones they use for stitching and other procedures is the same one that is being used in an OR. </p>

<p>The only point you might be onto is if the hospital had placed a bid out and it was filled by someone over charging for the items because they can. That&#39;s the way the government works. So even in that case if they are buying the forcep for 200 it&#39;s in actuality, the same one you can buy for 50. I assure you. </p>

<p>Now unless you have more experience in the industry then I, please just accept you are wrong and this is the reason we are getting screwed over. It&#39;s not that the equipment costs more. It&#39;s just not the case. And if it is it&#39;s due to overcharging by the bidders for service, because they can. </p>

<p>XD okay I&#39;ll just take the word of strangers on the internet as fact.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Definitely a factor, no doubt. A brain surgeon is going to want quality equipment, though, whereas if you need forceps for at home use, you&#39;re going to get some cheap ass stuff because you&#39;re just dressing a cut or burn or something. Aside from being over charged by medical supply companies, you also have the exorbitant cost of the medical facilities themselves. It&#39;s a shit sandwich from the ground up no matter how you look at it, and there really should be a government agency responsible for helping keep costs down in this industry. Profit ceilings can help, but that wont&#39; solve the problem. We had massive increases in healthcare costs even with profit ceilings on the healthcare industry.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I work for an insurance company, I pay about 350 monthly and my deductible is 3500. It doesn&#39;t make any sense to me, why is healthcare so god damn expensive? I don&#39;t even go to the doctor, I have several things I should go for right at this very second but I cannot afford it. I might be able to afford it if I didn&#39;t have to pay that 350 a month but alas, I must. I remember it wasn&#39;t that long ago that I was paying a little over $150 per month and I had low copays, most prescriptions were fully paid for and really the only thing I&#39;d have to worry about would be major surgeries.</p>

<p>Look at drug prices in canada,UK,Germany vs the US. they are 3-5x more expensive at least.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe the drug companies spend nearly as much money on advertisements in those countries (is it actually $0 since advertising isn&#39;t permitted outside the US??) for their drugs or lobbying to get regulations eased or removed.  </p>

<p>So while all these highly educated professional politicians and economists are totally confused on how to bring down the cost of healthcare I&#39;m sitting here watching $$$$ thrown at pointless ads on TV from Pfizer etc and driving past these hospitals that look more like Silicon Valley tech campuses with huge fountains and marble everywhere and just shaking my head.  Am I taking crazy pills here?</p>

<p>Much like the tax debate/student loan debate, the issue isn&#39;t the high taxes - its the inefficient manner which those tax dollars are spent.</p>

<p>Stop all the drug ads.  Hospitals should be simple buildings with quality staff and affordable care.  I don&#39;t believe this would fix the problem on it&#39;s own, but for fucks sake its a switch you could flip today and start seeing an impact immediately.  </p>

<p>Yes because government controlled health Care is awesome</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Seems pretty popular in literally every country with universal health care</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I can&#39;t wait for the day America has that and can legislate who gets what treatment </p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you&#39;re suggesting Fox News esque &quot;The government will have death panels!&quot; type hysteria, I just want to point out that people are <em>already</em> being denied healthcare, only through the abstraction of being priced out of it. People are already going years without seeing doctors for easily treated conditions simply because they can&#39;t afford it. These <em>same</em> people are then costing you money anyway when they inevitably rush to the emergency room, rack up medical debt they can&#39;t pay (which will be more expensive for a <em>treatment</em> than for <em>preventative</em> care) which inevitably passes cost on to you as our for profit insurance and pharmaceutical companies adjust costs. If you don&#39;t want to &quot;pay for other people&#39;s health care&quot; you should probably drop your (private) insurance coverage anyway because <em>that&#39;s literally the point of insurance</em>. The only difference is, it being privately owned, profit is skimmed off everything for shareholders&#39; exclusive benefit, and there is an economic incentive to fuck people over for profit if necessary. </p>

<p>This isn&#39;t even going into how fucked up it is that the majority of &quot;decent&quot; health coverage in the US (except for people who already get medicare...) only receive it through their employers. Frustrated at your job? Welp better hope you don&#39;t have a medical condition that necessitates frequent health care because you&#39;re fucked if you just up and quit. From a (left)-libertarian perspective, how free can you really be under such a system? </p>

<p>Not to mention the recent push for religious legal exemptions on benefits, what happens when your employer decides they don&#39;t want to cover something? Good luck friendo, hope it&#39;s not a necessary treatment.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Obviously it&#39;s always been cheaper to not buy health insurance. Also was cheaper to buy shitty health insurance that didn&#39;t cover hospital stays. The whole point of any sort of insurance is to have it before you need it.</p>
