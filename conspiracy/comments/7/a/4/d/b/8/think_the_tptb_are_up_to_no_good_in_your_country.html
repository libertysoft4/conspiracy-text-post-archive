        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So I didnt know much about this country called Estonia (north Europe west of Russia) until some of my friends from Poland which borders there told me about it. Once I started reading about it i discovered some REALLY disturbing stuff. It sounds like most horrifying Orwellian Soros-funded NWO human-phobic hellhole on earth and I hope the u.s. never ends up like that. Here is a sneak peak of the facts..    </p>

<ul>
<li>The government has all information about you in databases and you have to carry around an <a href="https://e-estonia.com/solutions/e-identity/id-card/">ID card</a> (remind anyone else of the Jewish stars in Nazi Germany??) and if you lose the card you are no-one. The government can literally delete your existence with a click of the button.<br/></li>
<li>Russian is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYgwAyac7Iw">forbidden</a> to be spoken in public places. You are not allowed to get a job or rent an apartment if you speak Russian but not Estonian. If you speak Russian even if you also speak Estonian you are not allowed to have Estonian citizenship and are not protected by the country&#39;s human rights laws. If this is not racism then what is??<br/></li>
<li>Estonia had over <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_migrant_crisis#cite_note-464">1 million asylum applicants</a> IN 2016 ALONE despite that the country only has a population of 1.3 million. The population does nothing to resist it.<br/></li>
<li>There are <a href="http://www.lgbt.ee/about-us/">LGBT</a> organizations obviously funded by Soros and other backers who&#39;s mission is to spread &quot;awareness&quot; about gay issues in Estonian society.<br/></li>
<li>In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_Night">2007</a> the government of Estonia decided to move a monument to the Russian soldier who freed the country from the Nazis in WW2, Russian people there started to protest and 171 were murdered by police.<br/></li>
</ul>

<p>Meanwhile the Estonian birth rate is going down and the rate of immigrants is going up and up and up, soon there will no be no white Estonians left, only refugees and computers/androids/feminized men. I did not know to much about this place before but it sounds like absolute HELL. I would not be one bit surprised if the leaders of Estonia were mind controlled by the American deep state and MK-ultra.   </p>

<p>EDIT also Hillary Clinton went there in 1996, as first lady. Hmm... what business would she have had in a small poor country only 4 years after it got independence?? <a href="https://www.upi.com/Archives/1996/07/08/US-first-lady-visits-Estonia/4877836798400">https://www.upi.com/Archives/1996/07/08/US-first-lady-visits-Estonia/4877836798400</a>  </p>

<p>ESTONIA IS IN THE WIKILEAKS EMAILS!! ONE TO PODESTA!!! <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/53759">https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/53759</a> WHY WERE THEY GOING THERE? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is all complete nonsense.  I live in the Baltics and much of your post is absurd.  The ID card is not what you say it is, it is the same as A Drivers license in ASV, except it doubles as many other cards, like bus pass for soviet pensioners.  </p>

<p>The gay agenda is being pushed in Northern Europe because it is last area of Europe not completely cucked and liberal.</p>

<p>Yes we have many Russians here.  There are no laws against speaking Russian.  Actually, Esti is one of last places freedom of speech exists in EU.  </p>

<p>Estonia does not border Poland at all, unless you consider islands 100s of Km deep into Baltic Sea and then Polish islands also very far off coast.  </p>

<p>There is typical corruption, mostly monetary and economic.  Not really much dark stuff if any is public.  Former president was very good friends with Bush Jr however. </p>

<p>Estonia is not not poor, it is the wealthiest of the Baltic countries.  </p>

<p>Baltic peoples are by and large nationalist.  This is why they do not put up with Western Europe&#39;s bullshit and mistakes regarding social issues.</p>

<p>It is true many fear future occupation, but it is split between will Russia annex region again or will it be EU/ASV globalist forces.  Through strength or slow roll out.... Former SSR countries remember their history of being bullied.</p>

<p>I live in a small town and the People of Color population decreased by 50% 10 years ago! One of the two black people who lived in the same town died!!!</p>

<p>Most of the immigrants we have are either Russians(from soviet times) at 25% of total population and like 1% of black educated university students(who i dont really care about, since AFAIK they are Westernized blacks, instead of those middle eastern terrorist &quot;sandniggers&quot;</p>

<p>Also, certificate update ruined my id card, so now its useless(cant even use it as grocery shop discount card...., luckily i have some physical non ID card based discount cards for stores that accept them(eg Rimi)....</p>

<p>I had only one time when i had to use that POS card in this year, and that was to give a state department of Estonia permission to view my info(to have a change of not getting drafted due to my medical history(depression, anxiety, etc...).....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay your sources based on that sneak peek? Very much full of shit.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and if you lose the card you are no-one. The government can literally delete your existence with a click of the button.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>False. Losing the ID card just means you go to a government office to void and replace it, using a passport, birth certificate or other legal id to replace it. And no, it can&#39;t all really be &quot;deleted with a click&quot;. Heck, it&#39;s transparent to the point that people can view a digital papertrail for every time a government officials has <em>viewed</em> their personal info. Obvious shill is obvious. Stop wasting everyone&#39;s time. Nonetheless, I&#39;ll refute that sneak peek of yours point-by-point.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Russian is forbidden to be spoken in public places.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh, is that why I keep hearing former occupants still speaking Russian openly in supermarkets and on the streets every damn time I visit Tallinn? I wasn&#39;t even aware mass arrests were taking place over that. /s<br/>
It&#39;s Russian propaganda bullshit and nothing more.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Estonia had over 1 million asylum applicants IN 2016 ALONE</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Uhh... what? Even the wikipedia citation you linked doesn&#39;t have those kinds of numbers (and is in fact mostly about Croatia). And the &#39;pedia article lists has a total of ~4000 applicants (most of whom were in fact rejected) from 2013 to 2016. Seriously, Estonia is having problems integrating the 25% of Russian colonists we already have over here. There&#39;s strong public opposition to large amounts of asylum seekers across ideological lines here.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are LGBT organizations obviously funded by Soros</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fair point, that part actually is true, though most Estonians remain apathetic about the issue and laugh about both the LGBT nuts pushing for &quot;progress&quot; <em>and</em> the deeply conservative moral outrage loons.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>freed the country from the Nazis in WW2,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Another example of standard revisionist bullshit copy-pasted from Russian/Soviet disinfo scripts. The Soviets were the ones that first &quot;freed&quot; independent Estonia from the &quot;burden&quot; of our independence in 1940, long before the Nazis turned their attention eastward. Not to mention it all took place under the auspices of the secret protocols in the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. And at the tail end of the war, the Soviets &quot;liberated&quot; Estonia by annexing the territory into the USSR on the basis of a &quot;referendum&quot; where only about a thousand Estonian communists (plus the Soviet soldiers present to &quot;secure&quot; the referendum) were allowed to vote in.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>171 were murdered by police.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Dafuq are you getting these numbers from? One guy was stabbed, likely by another protester. Only conspiracy theories I&#39;ve heard about that over here, is that some local crime bosses used the riots to get rid of the guy and get away clean. There were literally no other fatalities during the whole of the Bronze Night riots.</p>

<li><p>You don&#39;t necessarily have to carry your ID card with you but it&#39;s useful because you can access government sites with it or make it work as a library card or a discount card at the drug store so that you don&#39;t have to carry around a walletful of cards. The government doesn&#39;t have &quot;all information&quot; about you, just the bare necessities for social services. </p></li>
<li><p>Russian is not forbidden in public places and you don&#39;t necessarily even have to speak Estonian to get a job (Estonia is not as strict on this as Latvia, for example, and a lot of Russian-speaking Latvian citizens got jobs in Estonia when Latvia mandated that rule). If you want to have Estonian citizenship then you have to be able to speak Estonian. You are not barred from citizenship if your first language is Russian, that&#39;s just flat out absurd. </p></li>

<li><p>&quot;obviously funded by Soros&quot; isn&#39;t obvious. There are gay people in Estona who spread awareness about their issues. No conspiracy theory necessary to explain it. </p></li>
<li><p>&quot;freed the country from the Nazis&quot; - too bad there wasn&#39;t a Russian soldier who would have freed us from the Soviets. No idea where you got 171 dead from. 200 people were arrested, yes. Two protesters got into a knife-fight and one of them died because of it. </p></li>
