<p>I would think the first thing to do would be to leave a well populated area immediately. I don&#39;t mean this as an insult, I&#39;m genuinely curious.

<p>i think you&#39;re in the majority - most people think this.  i am a contrarian.  </p>

<p>cities offer these advantages over everywhere else:  vertical space.  the ability to funnel human (or otherwise) traffic, by blocking roads, etc.  same thing exists within buildings themselves.  access to goods for scavenging.  existing infrastructure particularly water supply and sewage.  access to people to aid you.  ability to hide.  ability to not be seen from air.</p>

<p>no other environment even comes close.  if you&#39;re confident in your ability to feed yourself (i am - i could grow what i needed, and i have expertise around me in terms of foraging, plant identification, etc.) then cities are a better choice.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are definitely pros and cons to both I just personally think you would need more luck on your side in a city. With that being said, having people you can trust would play a huge part in terms of success but &quot;other people&quot; is also my biggest fear. We are pretty much opposite sides of the spectrum here. :)</p>

<p>I am confident in my ability to feed myself and my family as we already have a huge garden, keep our seeds and I do some canning so we at least have experience in that. We are already the type of people who fix things (for the most part) ourselves. I think if you could survive the initial first few months in a rural area a person would be more in the clear than if they were in the city. </p>

<p>Have you read the story of the man who was trapped in a smallish (under 10,000 I think it was) town for a year in Bosnia during the war? Pretty interesting, about what you think it would be but is good to read it from someone who lived it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>yeah i hear you.  if you have a link to that Bosnian story i&#39;d be appreciative.  </p>

<p>in general i&#39;d agree with you, but here&#39;s my concern about the rural areas.  i&#39;m in Canada so i can only speak to that.  from my research, driving across the country, it&#39;s become evident to me that there&#39;s a defensive plan that&#39;s been constructed to support people in rural areas should an event take place.  the road routes, how they are built, how few routes lead to other places, locations of military facilities, etc. - this has been designed to shut off traffic and human movement to certain rural areas.  North Bay Ontario, in particular, has these designs all around it.  i reckon this is where the COG plans are supposed to be manifested (much like Denver is a COG center in the US mainland).  that means should something happen and people all migrate out to the rural places that they&#39;ll be under the thumb of whomever is managing those military resources.  from the frying pan into the fire.  </p>

<p>there will likely be loads of people trying to leave the city after an event.  this will just ratchet up the COG plans/levers.  options will be limited. </p>

<p>personally, i can only go with what i trust and know.  going into someone else&#39;s terrain, where they have formed it for particular uses, is a hometown advantage i won&#39;t have, with limited support, limited means and limited knowledge.  </p>

<p>The government/military is right up there with &quot;other people&quot; for me.  </p>

<p>And oh yeah, I don&#39;t particularly want a bunch of people from the cities flooding out into rural areas. I have wondered where they think they will go. It&#39;s not like farmers/county folks/mountain men are just going to let them settle on their land. Really I don&#39;t think there is a great answer for any scenario.</p>

<p>Major cities won&#39;t fare well without power. Just look at New York in &#39;77. Looting and chaos everywhere. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are definitely pros and cons to both I just personally think you would need more luck on your side in a city. With that being said, having people you can trust would play a huge part in terms of success but &quot;other people&quot; is also my biggest fear. We are pretty much opposite sides of the spectrum here. :)</p>

<p>I am confident in my ability to feed myself and my family as we already have a huge garden, keep our seeds and I do some canning so we at least have experience in that. We are already the type of people who fix things (for the most part) ourselves. I think if you could survive the initial first few months in a rural area a person would be more in the clear than if they were in the city. </p>

<p>Have you read the story of the man who was trapped in a smallish (under 10,000 I think it was) town for a year in Bosnia during the war? Pretty interesting, about what you think it would be but is good to read it from someone who lived it. </p>
