<p>Like, seriously? Clinton had been involved deeply in politics since she came out of her mother&#39;s womb, and you don&#39;t think she&#39;d have some tricks up her sleeve?</p>

<p>She&#39;d gotten paid by the world&#39;s wealthiest people, and you don&#39;t think she&#39;s got a corrupt bone in her body?</p>

<p>Well I guess it&#39;s never too late.</p>

<p>Welcome everyone who has recently woken up, this is going to be a long ride, and a very, very deep rabbit hole.</p>

<p>Jane Sanders (Bernie&#39;s wife) sold a property that she inherited from her parents.  That was the money they used to buy the beach house.  There were discussions about the DNC providing Bernie with a personal private plane after he dropped out, but he rescinded the request.  </p>

<p>The leftover money from his campaign was partially used to set up &quot;Our Revolution,&quot; part of it was used to help set up a progressive think tank, &quot;The Sanders Institute,&quot; and some of it is still in a bank account and will likely be used to fund Sanders&#39;s Senate campaign.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Burnie Sanders is an exception to the rule. I generally don&#39;t make campaign contributions. The only other I donated to was Obama, during the 2008 primaries, and only 75 bucks as far as I recall.</p>

<p>Obama turned out to be too comfortable with the corrupt. I still think Bernie Sanders would have been an honest president. He probably would have been treated like Trump in many ways, but without the same reaction to it. Both candidates are disliked by the people secretly in charge, because they are independent intentioned. Their polices are wildly different, but they are both likely to do what they wish rather than what the are pressured to do.</p>

<p>You didn&#39;t even attempt to respond to this, is that because you don&#39;t have a response ready yet?  Bernie had the nomination stolen from him according to the DNC Chair at the time, any points you make about his affiliation mean nothing because the parties head literally admitted to rigging it for HRC.</p>

<p>You&#39;re trying to muddy the waters by equating rigging with being at a disadvantage, cut that out we&#39;re way smarted than that here lol.</p>

<ol>
<li>Nobody had her winning &quot;by 90%&quot;. Some <strong>forecasters</strong> gave her a 90% chance of victory, which isn&#39;t crazy. Much more reasonable odds makers gave her around a 2/3 chance of winning (like 538 did). <strong>Pollsters</strong> were actually pretty accurate overall, especially with regards to the popular vote. The polls were not skewed - the results were almost always within the margin of error. </li>

<li><p>The polls were not rigged - they were actually pretty accurate in the primaries and the general, but few wanted to believe them.</p></li>
<li><p>Overflowing stadiums and city parks is not indicative of actual voting power. Older people and poor people (people who Clinton did really well with) don&#39;t go to rallies as much as younger, wealthier people do. But guess what? They all still get a vote. Rally support is not equal to actual voter support. </p></li>

<li><p>The polls oversampled certain demographics such as landline owners on purpose to give fraudulent results.  The polls got both the primaries and the general wrong.  Their methods are out of date.</p></li>
<li><p>To disregard the discrepancy in public support is intellectually dishonest to say the least.  Now you can say anything if you disregard observable reality.  You can make up any imaginary scenario where you rely on unobservable phenomena.</p></li>

<li><p>They don&#39;t overpoll landline owners to give skewed results - they do it because that&#39;s the best we have available. And guess what? Pollsters know this! That&#39;s why they try to make adjustments based on demographics to attempt to overcome sample bias. It&#39;s not perfect , but it&#39;s the best they can do currently.</p></li>
<li><p>Again, <strong>visible public support</strong> in rallies/events/public gatherings is <strong>NOT</strong> necessarily indicative of <strong>voter turnout</strong>, which is all that matters. Rallies are not scientific inquiries. Imagine that a candidate had Neonazi appeal. He might have great rallies where the same Neonazis showed up every time. But guess what? Come voting day most people are not going to vote for him, because most people don&#39;t agree with his views. </p></li>

<p>All of this, literally <strong>all of this</strong>, is unscientific and irrelevant to actual <strong>voting power.</strong> You&#39;re falling victim to what you can see with your eyes and what you allow your brain to trick you into thinking is the entirety of voters, instead of realizing how silly and unscientific that thinking is. </p>

<p>Your line of argument is like saying, &quot;I live in Wisconsin, and I&#39;ve <strong>never</strong> seen a tiger. We all know tigers are made up. We know they&#39;re not real! Trust your eyes!&quot; There is more to the world to what you can see right in front of you. Voters are everyone - not just the people who put bumper stickers on care, not just the people who go to rallies, and not just the people with signs on their front lawns. They&#39;re not even just the people who talk about their favorite candidate all the time. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have written summaries of the methods they used before, but I am going to borrow <a href="/u/some_a_hole">/u/some_a_hole</a>&#39;s synopsis that he posted in another thread, because he summarizes it better than I ever have, and also thought to include items I wasn&#39;t aware of:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Limit the number of debates from 16 before Iowa in 2008, to 4 before Iowa in 2016.</p>

<p>Change democratic primary campaign finance rules by reversing an anti-corruption rule against lobbyist donations (I estimate this gave Hillary an extra around $100 million to work with during the primary).</p>

<p>Funnel money from the state parties to Hillary&#39;s primary campaign.</p>

<p>Have superdelegates make known their vote before the convention to make Hillary look like she&#39;s winning by more than she really was.</p>

<p>Put conservative states early in the primary voting process.</p>

<p>Change progressive&#39;s voter registration in closed primary states to independent (not yet proven democratic insiders did this, but it did happen very often compared to previous elections, and in important primary states).</p>

<p>Kick progressives off voter rolls in NY (again not proven it was on purpose to help Hillary but it did occur much more often this election, and illegally. Why would they break the law for no apparent reason?).</p>

<p>Rigged Nevada: Sen. Harry Reid, the former Senate Majority Leader and most powerful elected official in Nevada, as it later emerged, arranged a plan with owners of Las Vegas casinos, where many caucuses were being held, and other employers, to ensure Clinton would win. The Nevada caucuses were then rigged with massive voting irregularities such as casino owners orchestrating which workers would be allowed to vote and, in clear intimidation, openly monitoring how they voted.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>All of these things together have a measured effect on votes for Sanders during the primary. The usual talking point against this is &quot;Yeah but Hillary won by over 3M votes&quot;. I&#39;m sorry, but 3M votes is not as big a number as it sounds. There are over 200M registered voters in the united states. 3M is only 1.5% of that. I think it&#39;s more than reasonable to conclude that the measures taken by the DNC made the difference between Sanders winning and losing.</p>

<p>&quot;This sub is T_D 2.0,&quot; debunked. Here are some huge anti-Trump threads that I found in this sub from a quick search. They go from 1,000 all the way to 26,000 points, sometimes <strong>over 90 percent upvoted.</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6xqt3e/dont_let_them_divide_us_brothers_sisters_of/dmizqfg/">https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6xqt3e/dont_let_them_divide_us_brothers_sisters_of/dmizqfg/</a></p>

<p>Liberals absolutely dominate the comments in this sub (not a bad thing),  then they pretend to be the minority and claim this sub is &quot;overflowing&quot; with Trump supporters. My favorite thing to see in this sub is someone claim &quot;I know I will be downvoted by you Trumptards who control this sub, but fuck Trump!,&quot; <em>upvoted to 356 points.</em></p>

<p>There are many different groups of people in this sub. Trump supporters, Clinton supporters, anti-Trump liberals, Bernie Sanders supporters, Trey Gowdy supporters, Ron Paul supporters, etc. Criticism of Obama or Clinton does not automatically make someone a Trump supporter. Exhibit A: Me. The people who upvote those posts are not necessarily Trump supporters. They are probably the same people who upvote posts criticizing Trump. </p>

<p>If this sub was &quot;T_D 2.0,&quot; or &quot;overflowing with Trumptards,&quot; or any other version of that claim, then anti Trump comments wouldn&#39;t be upvoted, and the threads I cited above also wouldn&#39;t be upvoted, especially to 90 percent. </p>

<p>The truth is that there are many competing factions in this sub. I might be literally the only anti Trump user who admits this, or at least I&#39;m not aware of any others. The rest of them just want to make everyone feel like guilty Trump supporters for participating here. They don&#39;t realize that they also participate here and are basically talking shit about themselves. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I, uh, have dug pretty deep into the subject. Evolution is an easily demonstrable fact in rapidly-reproducing populations and in human guided development of I.E. dogs and cows. There is literally nothing about humans that makes us special as animals besides our large brains, which when placed next to the brains of chimpanzees and dolphins appear completely to be another logical step in development.</p>

<p>If you accept evolution of all other creatures - As I said, a demonstrable fact - and simply believe that humans are somehow special, there&#39;s plenty of evidence to the contrary. If you don&#39;t accept evolution at all, you&#39;re probably not susceptible to evidence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Humans existed along side all the different primates/neanderthals.  Most of these species went extinct due to our polar ice caps being hit by meteors which created huge floods and decimating the food source for all living things. Humans lived through this and are rebuilding.  The pyramids are evidence for this a long with the megalithic structure all over the world with smaller, less sophisticated architecture built on top of it.   There is plenty of evidence that humans existed up to 200,000 million years ago.  It&#39;s a subject called forbidden archeology.

 Science has been controlled by the same secret societies that control politicians/medicine/banking/hollywood/agriculture/religion for a very long time time now.  The catholic church used to just straight up kill you, now they have to ridicule you or fire you.<br/>

<p>There&#39;s simply no such thing as a transitional fossil.. Creatures don&#39;t have &#39;partially developed features&#39;. You have wolves, dog-like wolves, wolf-like dogs, less wolf-like dogs, and chihuahuas and pugs. They&#39;re all separate creatures that are extremely closely related but that show clear evolutionary changes and they&#39;re all the fuck over the place. You have big cats, slightly less big cats, small cats that look like tiny versions of big cats and that hunt in the woods for survival, and somewhat domesticated cats that still have the instincts to avoid water, bury poop, and eviscerate prey. Evolutionary &#39;transitions&#39; are all around you. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah sorry i meant 200 million years.<br/>
What your talking about are adaptations.  A lot of those breeds of dogs were created through cross breeding and inbreeding wolves with each other.  There is no evidence of species changing from one species into another.<br/>
I think it is insane to believe that all life on earth can evolve from a single cell through random mutation,  especially when you see the math behind all of creation.<br/>
Why does nature follow strict mathematical patterns if it is all created by random mutations?

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not a false dichotomy. It is simply a theoretical framework that has the most evidence for it. If another theoretical framework had more evidence then it would become the dominant narrative. Take a look at theoretical physics. There are many theories in different areas that compromise the best representation of reality. Behind each of those are theories that are highly contested yet provide i slightly less accurate framework (for the time being). Until they are more robust they cannot be accepted as the leading theories.</p>

<p>A healthy dose of skepticism is important but if you cannot come to a conclusion (even if incomplete just the best approximation with the available evidence) then skepticism is useless and you have no platform for the next leap forward or backwards. </p>

<p>Now if you want to talk about biases in research and forming opinions or the culture in academia that is a different discussion requiring different theories in a different discipline.</p>

And you can&#39;t even explain what it so bad about that or why it&#39;s abnormal.  You honestly can&#39;t be so naive to beileve that journalists didn&#39;t have similar ways of gaining inside access to the Romney or McCain or Bush or Obama or Trump Campaigns can you?    Furthermore I showed you how this sort of inside access doesn&#39;t seen to have helped Clintons media coverage since according to the Harvard study the vast majority of her coverage was negative while Trumps was positive.  So yes,  you are being lazy.

    <div class="md"><p>If you&#39;re talking about 2020, then why wouldn&#39;t he? People who liked Clinton will probably support the next democratic candidate just so Trump isn&#39;t elected again. Very few people support Trump on his own merits, he was the anti Clinton candidate. Many people actually like Sanders and few people hate him.</p>

<p>Plus Bernie doesn&#39;t have any outstanding charges of corruption, hacked emails, or anything else for Trump to rage about.</p>

<p>Calling Sanders a communist would probably help his odds since the democrats want things like free health care and tuition.</p>

An independent who ran as a democrat, debating a lifelong democrat who ran as a republican. Both outsiders to the Big Two parties. Super capitalist man vs. Democratic socialist man.  </p>

<p>I think the election as a whole would have been a lot more respectable if Hillary lost the primary. It ended up being whatever your word is for Trump versus the classic turd sandwich politician. Weak as fuck in my opinion. Her platform was just an clumsy amalgation of ideas from corporate consultants that she slapped her name on.  </p>

<p>Regardless of who would win in a race between Bernie and Trump, we would still be where we currently are today thanks to our worthless ass congress. They don&#39;t get shit done. Might as well elect a monkey with down syndrome and have him drool on the desk for 4 years. Nothing gets done anymore without an executive order, thanks to the rich do-nothings that occupy all the seats. Bernie would probably get even less done than Trump with this current  batch of loudmouth hacks</p>

<p>Or, if we believe that Trump is in on it, and it&#39;s all just for show, then you are correct that whoever is elected will bend the knee to get the job.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s dumb to make this kind of vow.  I&#39;m going to pick the lesser evil if I&#39;m in a state where my vote can make the difference between either establishment candidate winning.  If I&#39;m in a safe state for either party, I&#39;m going to vote third party.    Maybe it&#39;s just because I&#39;ve been through quite a few of these elections, but I&#39;ve come to find no matter who you support, there is going to be a lot of shady stuff going on behind the scenes.  I&#39;m going to vote with the policy I support in mind.  And the Republicans are disastrous to the kind of policy I support. The Democrats are much lesser of a threat to that policy. You always have to balance pragmatism with principles. That&#39;s just life. </p>

<p>I grabbed this screenshot of one of the Podesta emails during the election. Is it a smoking gun? No, but I&#39;m certain the election wasn&#39;t just &quot;stolen&quot; from Sanders. It would not surprise me one bit if it was purchased from him. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I, too, was greatly let down that a &quot;straight-talker&quot; who declared that he would &quot;go all the way to the convention and contest it if need be&quot; would so suddenly get strong-armed by HRC.  Over time, I came to realize that he maybe didn&#39;t fully buy into the massive HRC / Clinton corruptions.  BS would have been steam-rolled by the Deep State element.  His eyes were not open to the very threat that took him out of the running.  Then afterward, he could have been vocal about these corruptions, but was not.  BS would have possibly been a Yuge let-down as Pres, allowing himself to get steered and led-around by a very devious &amp; persistent element.  </p>

<p>You know what? Yes. Let&#39;s clean house. Let&#39;s get our priorities in order. Let&#39;s use this opportunity to bring uncomfortable stuff out in the light and get ourselves together, at long last.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t want to do it. None of us do. But we need to accept this, embrace it as an <em>opportunity</em> to put things (and perceptions) back where they should be. And then maybe we can finally, finally move the fuck on from 2016.</p>

<p>She is the first woman to lead a winning Presidential campaign as well.</p>

<p>Manafort was fired 3 months in. And it&#39;s not like he suddenly appeared in politics.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Paul John Manafort Jr. (born April 1, 1949)[2] is an American lobbyist, political consultant and lawyer. He joined Donald Trump&#39;s presidential campaign team in March 2016 and served as campaign manager from June to August 2016. He was previously an adviser to the U.S. presidential campaigns of Republicans Gerald Ford, Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush, and Bob Dole.</p>

<p>So you have the brother of Hillary&#39;s campaign manager indicted, and the fired Trump manager who is indicted.</p>

<p>Podesta Group has done a lot of work in Ukraine, like Manafort has.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hah, by that logic, Manafort has nothing to do with Trump, similar to how Podesta&#39;s have nothing to do with Hillary? Works for me.</p>

<p>Conspiring against the US in what capacity? As Trump&#39;s campaign manager? Or for his lobbying work in the years 2002-2014? 
Why did Manafort work with the Podesta group during the years that he is currently being investigated for?</p>

<p><strong>And why does the indictment include NOTHING about Trump&#39;s campaign?</strong></p>

<p>So it&#39;s not possible that Manafort and Podesta&#39;s were in contact with one another? I thought this was conspiracy.</p>

<p>Personally, I wanted Bernie to win at first. And seeing what Donna Brazille is saying now is lining up with so much. She literally gave Hillary debate questions, only way she had any chance against Bernie.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok let me try to explain this as simply as possible. Manafort is charged with not registering as a foreign agent and conspiracy against the US.
The president of he united states hired this man. This means he is either an idiot with poor vetting skills, because Manaforts shady behavior was common knowledge, or he wanted to benefit from said shady behavior.
There is no way Trump is not implicated in a negative way. Either he is an idiot or he is complicit.</p>

<p>Now as far as Popadopolis goes. His activity is more directly incriminating. There is evidence that he and DT jr were actively trying to set up meetings with russian officials. And the campaign was receptive to those meetings.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure Trump personally researched the decades of Manafort&#39;s work and made the decision himself.</p>

<p>Trump being an idiot is right in line with the media narrative, so why can&#39;t that just be it? He fired him upon the news going public. </p>

<p><strong>Trump campaign making one bad vetting decision does not mean they colluded with the Russians.</strong></p>

Many Independent voters didn&#39;t want to see another Bush or Clinton presidency. Trump won in part because he was an outsider. Sanders probably would&#39;ve won if he was a choice.

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a loophole. Are we gonna give a pass to Hillary because she used a loophole instead of closing it? </p>

<h1>Hillary and the DNC totally rigged the DNC so that Jim Webb and Bernie Sanders had no chance.</h1>

<p>Let&#39;s move on to the Donna Brazille stuff that&#39;s confirming what we knew a year ago.</p>

<p>DNC was 25million in debt by 2014/2015.</p>

<p>Hillary Victory Fund was a fundraising committee set up to fundraise for the Clinton campaign, the DNC, and 32 Democratic committees.</p>

<p>FEC laws dictate you are only allowed to donate $2,700 direct to Presidential campaign, but the limits are higher for state parties and party&#39;s national nominee.</p>

<p>Hillary took the $2,700. </p>

<p>She also took the $10,000 allowed to each of the 32 committees, and the $33,000 allowed direct to the DNC.</p>

<p>This money was then transferred into State parties, and then the money was transferred back to the DNC, over which Hillary and Debbie had full control over. Including the $8 million funding of the false Trump dossier.</p>

<p>Nice $350,000 pull right there.</p>

<p>The 32 States that had their money essentially stolen by law loopholes, now had far less money to fund their own state elections. Sacrifice for the greater good? It was her turn after all.</p>

<p>At the end of all this, the states kept less than half-a-percent, 0.5%, of the $82 million that was eventually raised by the Hillary Victory fund.</p>

<p>Corruption, money laundering, so glad she is far away from The White House.</p>

Just like no one ever mentions that Hillary, the Podestas, Comey and Alefantis are all originally from Chicago not to mention that Obama launched his political career from there too. Or the historical corruption and collusion between the Democrats who&#39;ve always run the city and most of the State and organised crime going all the way back to the days of Al Capone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So Hillary promised to help the DNC out of its debt by campaigning for them and in return she wanted full control of the DNC for her election. When they gave her the control she used it to steer all the money raised not only by herself but also other DNC agencies to herself and leave the DNC high and dry. FFS.

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you my man, people that can&#39;t see she is one of the most corrupt fema... actually she&#39;s world class corrupt for any of the 64 genders, anyone who couldn&#39;t see that 10 years ago let alone since her secretarial debut I was convinced had their heads so far up their ass they could see what they had for lunch.</p>

<p>Just watch any of the videos where she&#39;s lying for 12 minutes straight for 100s of irrelevant things and it&#39;s very obvious she doesn&#39;t have a single honest bone in her body. She was pulling shady shit off literally her first job as a lawyer(before getting disbarred of course) and has had scandals every decade of her life. </p>

<p>Hilary had the DNC head over heels for her since 20 years ago people, fuck. That&#39;s why Pelosi is still on board too, because she brings in the dough and no one questions how. With Hilary it&#39;s obvious- she&#39;ll take money from every two bit dictator and Hollywood rapist that&#39;ll provide it. She doesn&#39;t care about women, international rights, her own &#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;marraige&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;, her or really anything but her power. Maybe Hubell and their daughter perhaps.  People that see more to her that that are delusional period. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They usually downvote Trump supporters, usually upvote anti Trump comments, upvote anti Trump posts to the top of the sub, sometimes to 90 percent, but then they claim this sub is completely controlled by Trump supporters. They want to have their cake and eat it too. </p>

<p>&quot;This sub is T_D 2.0,&quot; debunked. Here are some huge anti-Trump threads that I found in this sub from a quick search. They go from 1,000 all the way to 26,000 points, sometimes <strong>over 90 percent upvoted.</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6xqt3e/dont_let_them_divide_us_brothers_sisters_of/dmizqfg/">https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6xqt3e/dont_let_them_divide_us_brothers_sisters_of/dmizqfg/</a></p>

<p>Liberals absolutely dominate the comments in this sub (not a bad thing),  then they pretend to be the minority and claim this sub is &quot;overflowing&quot; with Trump supporters. My favorite thing to see in this sub is someone claim &quot;I know I will be downvoted by you Trumptards who control this sub, but fuck Trump!,&quot; <em>upvoted to 356 points.</em></p>

<p>There are many different groups of people in this sub. Trump supporters, Clinton supporters, anti-Trump liberals, Bernie Sanders supporters, Trey Gowdy supporters, Ron Paul supporters, etc. Criticism of Obama or Clinton does not automatically make someone a Trump supporter. Exhibit A: Me. The people who upvote those posts are not necessarily Trump supporters. They are probably the same people who upvote posts criticizing Trump. </p>

<p>If this sub was &quot;T_D 2.0,&quot; or &quot;overflowing with Trumptards,&quot; or any other version of that claim, then anti Trump comments wouldn&#39;t be upvoted, and the threads I cited above also wouldn&#39;t be upvoted, especially to 90 percent. </p>

<p>The truth is that there are many competing factions in this sub. I might be literally the only anti Trump user who admits this, or at least I&#39;m not aware of any others. The rest of them just want to make everyone feel like guilty Trump supporters for participating here. They don&#39;t realize that they also participate here and are basically talking shit about themselves. </p>
