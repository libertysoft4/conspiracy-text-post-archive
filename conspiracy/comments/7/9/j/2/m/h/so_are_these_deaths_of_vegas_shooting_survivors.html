It&#39;s a country music concert in Las Vegas, both things older people enjoy. &quot;Relatively healthy&quot; is also a completely baseless assumption.

    <div class="md"><p>And the majority of those are via cancer and heart disease.  People one month away from cancer deaths are not usually in Vegas line dancing.They are in homes/hospitals/hospice.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not the RATE of deaths that&#39;s odd. It&#39;s such peculiar methods. Fiery car crashes and homicides are not normal.  Deaths in vehicle fires in 2015 = 445  out of 320 million US population means 445/320,000,000. This is about a ONE in ONE MILLION chance. <a href="http://www.nfpa.org/News-and-Research/Fire-statistics-and-reports/Fire-statistics/Vehicle-fires/Highway-vehicle-fires">http://www.nfpa.org/News-and-Research/Fire-statistics-and-reports/Fire-statistics/Vehicle-fires/Highway-vehicle-fires</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>The girl (Kymberley Suchomel) was already sick and her own family and friends don&#39;t find her death suspicious. Her friend, Rick Ardito, who she mentioned in her Facebook post, has been on social media and radio interviews telling pretty much the same story as Kymberley (both before and after her death) and nobody has killed him. Not suspicious. </p>

<p>The guy (Danny Contreras) is legitimately dead, but his tweets and connecting to the concert/shooting are questionable. I&#39;ve seen no authentication of his <em>&quot;Feeling lcky to be alive, cant believe i got out of concert alive! 2 men chasing me with guns. not evry 1 so lcky.&quot;</em> tweet; just a screenshot that appeared in speculative articles after his death was announced. The account they link to has been suspended, so there&#39;s no way to know if the tweet is real or falsified. And even if it is real, we still don&#39;t know for sure he was even at the concert/near the shooting. Brian Hodges lied on social media about being in the room next to the shooter, this guy could be doing the same. If what authorities said is true and the victim had gang ties, he could&#39;ve been lying about 2 guys chasing him with a gun to build street cred. For now, all we have is a few low-cred sites reporting on the connection and until I see the tweet authenticated and proof he was at the concert, I&#39;m gonna say it&#39;s not suspicious. </p>

<p>The couple died in a car accident near their California home. Their daughters said that their parents had a new lease on life after the shooting -- which could imply living-on-the-edge activities like partying and speeding. It didn&#39;t sound like they were dwelling on the shooting, and the husband still hadn&#39;t even gotten his phone back from when he abandoned it during the shooting, so it&#39;s not like he was holding incriminating video or anything (the daughters received his phone in the mail after he died). The saddest part is that one of the daughters (16yo) heard the loud crash and ran outside to discovered her parents&#39; car engulfed in flames. Incredibly tragic but really not suspicious. </p>
