    <div class="md"><p>Just to qualify this, I was an environmental chemist for 20 years and 50% of my work was with drinking water, I&#39;m not just punching out on Fiji water because I like Dasani or something. It is about impurities. Look at the label on Figi, they advertise their impurities as a <em>feature</em>. It is kind of hilarious to me, it has a profile like sorta cleaned up tap water. </p>

<p>Quick experiment I usually give to people who don&#39;t want to spend money in my lab. Clean 2 stemless wine glasses really well, the kind with smooth sides. Put your oven at like 450°f. But a cup of your figi water in one, put a cup of any purified or distilled drinking water in the other. </p>

<p>Now bake those for several hours until it is completely dry, and compare the residue. Bonus points if you have a nice scale that goes to 2 or 3 places past 0, carefully weigh and record the initial weight of both glasses before you put water in them. Then weigh them again when they are completely dry and cool. Calculate the difference, and you have total solids for both waters.</p>

<p>The distiled water might have like 50mg/l of residue. The Figi, iirc (I tested all the commercial waters at one point) will be at about 250mg/l. Now these aren&#39;t necessarily &quot;bad&quot; contaminants, but it is dirty water compared to actual clean water.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for the clarity my friend! I&#39;ll start researching Fiji more but I have to say since she started the Fiji there was a noticeable difference.  It was startling for anyone that had been around her for the last few years.  It&#39;s hard to put down something that may be working.  I will continue to research though and wouldn&#39;t have had it not been for your post here.  Thanks again!</p>

<p>And maybe it isn&#39;t a bad thing, maybe I should not have ruined it for you. Maybe there is a contaminant you <em>are</em> sensitive to in the water you were drinking before? Who knows. I hope you figure it out though man. Nice talking to you!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Man, I am sorry that you are going through this with your mom especially so early in her life. She is lucky to have you. Older people, even those with their mental faculties intact, need an advocate to navigate the medical system. (Actually, anyone regardless of age could use a medical advocate if they&#39;re sick in the US because the system is so screwed up and navigating it is the last thing they should have to think about when they&#39;re sick.) </p>

<p>You&#39;re clearly not afraid to question proposed diagnoses and treatments. And to do some research yourself. Again, your mom is lucky to have you for support. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sorry about your mom. You might want to look inro Lion&#39;s mane mushroom. There are clinical studies showing improvement for people with mild cognitive impairment (i.e. early stage dementia) in the areas of memory, cognition, and learning. Lions mane mushroom seems to have unique neuroregenerative properties, and no side effects. There was a seller on ebay out of Florida (if I recall correctly) who was selling capsules that were a blend of mycelium and whole mushroom water extraction, and selling at a very fair price.</p>
