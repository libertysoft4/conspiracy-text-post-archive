    <div class="md"><p>You seem new to all of this. Short of creating your own country and gaining sovereign immunity under international law what are you going to do to defeat the elite. Even that does not guarantee that you do. Gives you a protection but, it&#39;s only half the battle. What do you do after that? Declare war? Who are you going to declare war on? You cannot take them to court because, they created the courts and the laws. So please enlightened me on how you think we can defeat the elite who have ruled for hundreds of thousands of years? </p>

It is the job of the conspiracy community to awaken the brainwashed masses and the awakened masses will defeat the elite.

    <div class="md"><p>The way the elite control the masses is a function of consciousness. They are called elite because they have higher consciousness than the average human. What the elite do is human farming. We are cattle to them. It is similar to how one Shepard can manipulate hundreds of sheep. The Shepard is far outnumbered by the sheep but it doesn&#39;t matter. The shepard has high consciousness and the sheep have low consciousness so the sheep cannot see how they are being herded to their eventual slaughter. The sheep could use their superior numbers to kill the shepard but their consciousness is too low for that. It is the same way in human societies. Elite rule and people are cattle to be exploited. The consciousness of the masses is too low so they never rise up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol, it would be a nice start if the community could agree on a single definition of who the elites are. </p>

<p>For some it&#39;s an abstruse coterie of people hiding in government hideout, whiles for others it&#39;s the democrats feeding on babies&#39;s flesh.

    <div class="md"><p>I think you might have got that backwards. The people are the ants, the elite are the people. Okay I see how that could&#39;ve been worded better. </p>

<p>But the point was the same, unfortunately, there is no &quot;get the power back&quot; in my mind. We wanted safety and to not feel scared of the big bad communists so we created a protector. We made it stronger and less limited than anything anyone else had at the time. It worked great and our country thrived but we made plenty of mistakes. The main one, we didn&#39;t give it any limits. Now we&#39;re stuck with a big brother that&#39;s just as likely to give you a noogie as its likely to beat up your bully. </p>

<p>If theres a plan of action or something to bring about real change for the better then PLEASE fill me in. I don&#39;t want to be so hopeless, I just can&#39;t see the way out. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea I agree, somewhat. I think you&#39;re on the right path but if it were that simple then someone would&#39;ve figured out a way to make it mainstream by now. Unless maybe that&#39;s what we&#39;re doing, right now. With a little bit of time I could be self sufficient but we&#39;d still live on their land, under their rules. Besides, theres an entire group of people that couldn&#39;t survive without wellfare. Do you think theres the slightest chance of them becoming sufficient?

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe I failed your test but I have no further guesses. All your hints point to different forms of media. Most entertaining, games. Least respected, radio. Originally you said besides writing its the earliest form of storytelling, speech. Movies are based on it, written word? Now it comes after writing so I&#39;m at a loss. Paintings? Thoughts? Poetry?</p>

<p>We have been tricked into thinking the world is far more complex than it is.. they rely on that. That goes for every walk of life. especially science.. they have convinced us aliens hold the secrets.... nothing could be further from the truth... the reality is so simple it&#39;s unbelievable.</p>
