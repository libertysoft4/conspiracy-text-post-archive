    <div class="md"><p>Enlighten us on how you are always able to say exactly what you mean, without possibly offending anyone. I’ll wait. Intent is a major part of interpersonal communication, and the user you are blatantly attacking already explained the intent wasn’t to protect a pedophile. But god forbid anyone not concisely form a cogent thought every single time they speak. </p>

<p>Jesus, they even admitted they were wrong and chose to rephrase and you continue to press the attack. Why is this, because attacking posters is all you have. Enjoy that-you miserably transparent, pedantic, and vindictive little person.</p>

<p>We have a massive problem in society where kids are getting raped and here you come, pretending that you <em>&quot;desire to be contrarian&quot;</em> which is a laughable statement because society at large does not accept pedophiles in any shape or form.</p>

<p>You are literally a pedophile enabler, you might not have known it, but you do now.</p>

It differs from pedophilia (the primary or exclusive sexual interest in prepubescent children),[1][2][3] and from ephebophilia (the primary sexual interest in later adolescents, typically ages 15–19).[1][4]”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Call me a pedophile apologist and downvote me. I&#39;m sure you will. This sub has a huge hard on for anything pedophile related. But let&#39;s at least get one thing straight. The exact definition of pedophile is the sexual preference of prepubescent children. The preference over others, but just the attraction itself. But I&#39;m not excusing pedophiles. That&#39;s irrelevant, because even if the accusations are true Kevin Spacey is not a pedophile. Ephebophilia is the sexual preference of post pubescent adolescents. Again not just the attraction but the specific preference over other age ranges. Aside from the being illegal in some countries, certainly not all, the attraction to 14+ year old adolescents is considered psychologically normal and even the specific preference, again not just the occasional attraction, is not considered a pathology or paraphilia. In fact through literally all of human history there was no stigma associated with such behavior. Assuming the allegations are true, according to the &quot;victim&quot; he was not sexually assaulted, raped or anything of the like. An inebriated Spacey made a sexual advance and when it was clear the other party was not interested the encounter ended.</p>

<p>So what is the benefit to anyone involved to bring this up 30 years later? What is the point? Why ruin someone&#39;s career over an uncomfortable encounter that happened decades ago? And of course the she&#39;s of the internet want to scream rape and pedophilia, both of which are entirely untrue. All it does is minimize the damage of actual rape and pedophilia. A guy says something inappropriate? It&#39;s not rape. A guy makes a sexual advance and you don&#39;t like it? That&#39;s not rape. This plague of bringing literally dozens of famous people down with unprovable accusations from decades past is the real conspiracy. What is the point of this new witch hunt? Anyone who has ever had even a brief encounter with a celebrity or powerful person can now completely destroy their career and reputation with a single tweet. Is that not scary in itself? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What the fuck does that even mean? Yea it&#39;s deflection you&#39;re right. I&#39;m totally a pedophile. A satanic pedophile just like everyone else in the world according to you fucking faggots who ruined this God damn sub. I used to come here to talk about actual world events until literally every other fucking story on the front page is about pedophile this pedophile that. Fucking satanic child murdering pedophiles with secret dungeons under their strip mall restaurants. Give me a fucking break. You&#39;re right I&#39;m splitting hairs by pointing out that two things are completely fucking different from each other. We wouldn&#39;t even be having this discussion if this happened in Albania, Andorra, Austria, Bulgaria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Estonia, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Liechtenstein, Macedonia, Montenegro, Portugal, San Marino or Serbia because the age of consent is 14. If you want to defend witch hunting and destroying people&#39;s lives and careers over things that happened decades ago because it violates your puritanical sense of morality go right the fuck ahead. I&#39;ll go right back to diddling kids while worshiping Satan. You people make me sick. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Kevin Spacy is a pedophile. He&#39;s a great actor, a great liar. It doesn&#39;t matter if he&#39;s gay, or just came out. Gay people, like anyone else, have pedophiles - does it somehow get you a get-out-of-jail-free card? Hell fuck no! </p>

<p>His career should end. Why are people even debating this? Are we sympathizing with the gay pedophile? He fucked/molested Anthony Rapp (whom I love since RENT) when Rapp was only 14. If he did it then, you know he fucked again...another 14 year old. He thought he sat on high, untouchable. In reality, these powerful pedophiles are nothing more than cowards, always hiding in the dark, always scared of the light. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t even waste your time. I&#39;m unsubscribing from this sub. Their obsession with pedophiles has turned into something really sickening. This used to be a place to discuss government corruption and its turned into something so fucking bizarre and cultish it&#39;s scary. The fact that this literally is not the description of pedophilia doesn&#39;t compute. I&#39;m done here. They don&#39;t even have the reading comprehension to understand that he&#39;s not even being accused of rape. Or molestation. He drunkenly came onto the kid at a cast party for a play they were in. He didn&#39;t lure the kid there. He was in his 20s. Did he show poor decision making skills? Sure whatever. Was anyone in any way harmed by his actions. No I don&#39;t think they were and the fact that this guy wants to bring this up 30 years later makes him a real piece of shit. He&#39;s not a predator, a rapist, a child molester, a pedophile. But fuck it, y&#39;all wanna pretend everyone in the world is running around fucking kids for Satan or whatever go right the fuck ahead. </p>
