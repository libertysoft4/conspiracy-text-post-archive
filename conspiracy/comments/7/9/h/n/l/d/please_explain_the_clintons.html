I just font know why or any of the back story. I am in my twenties and didn&#39;t start paying attention to politics until recently. So could someone please explain the history and misdeeds of Clintons and crew to me like I an an alien arrived from another planet or a child or an ignorant adult (which I am).

    <div class="md"><p>Did you know the sight of the Waco Massacre is nearly smack dab between Mena Arkansas airport and a small airport known to be used by Mexican cartel on the Mexico/Texas border? And that there is a small airport beside the Branch Davidian complex that was &#39;out of commission&#39; from 1948-August 1993. Just after the massacre it was suddenly purchased and started up again. Remember how involved Vince Foster was with Waco? Remember how there&#39;s congressional testimony that says he had an important file on the massacre in his office and that file was taken by staff of the First Lady and brought directly to the residence never to be seen again? And then Vince &quot;killed himself&quot;. Think on that one. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s an oldie for you: When Bill Clinton was president, he ordered the military to bomb a &#39;chemical weapons factory&#39; in Iraq, dubbed Operation Infinite Reach. Bombing Iraq at that time was big news and the media had to cover it. He did this to push his Monica Lewinsky scandal out of the news cycle, since she testified to Congress on the same day.</p>

<p>Turns out that chemical weapons factory was just an aspirin factory..</p>

<p><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3758922/Bill-Clinton-bombed-Iraq-distract-Monica-scandal-Huma-Abedin-s-Muslim-journal-claimed-boss-s-husband.html">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3758922/Bill-Clinton-bombed-Iraq-distract-Monica-scandal-Huma-Abedin-s-Muslim-journal-claimed-boss-s-husband.html</a></p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombing_of_Iraq_(1998)">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombing_of_Iraq_(1998)</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Operation Infinite Reach attacks became known as &quot;Monica&#39;s War&quot; among TV news people, due to the timing. ABC-TV announced to all stations that there would be a special report following Lewinsky&#39;s testimony before Congress, then the special report was pre-empted by the report of the missile attacks. The combination of the timing of that attack and Operation Desert Fox led to accusations of a Wag the Dog situation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It all started in 44 B.C. when Hillary murdered Julius Caesar because he threatened to expose her affair with Cleopatra.    Then in the year 33 A.D., she sold Jesus to the Romans for 150 million pieces of gold, but deleted all the evidence by destroying over 33 million stone tablets...  Then in 1914, she ordered the murder of Franz Ferdinand because he was going to expose her history of corruption, murder, and lies...  Ferdinand&#39;s murder was blamed on a simple robbery, even though nothing was taken and he still had his wallet.   This started WWI.   </p>
