(I heard about it about a year before the story really broke since there is more of a media black out of such things in the US)  Saudi was also bringing ISIS oil to market...

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s hard to give you the proof you need since I am getting it from a human source. He was/is well connected in Saudi Arabia. Let&#39;s say as far as independent knowledge concerned.  (Independent from govts and such) He is very well connected on the grapevine...  If you understood the geopolitical situation in Saudi (which you probably do) You would probably know there are certain factions which do not support the actions of the Saudi govt and the Saudi Royal family.  Thus they gather much of this through their own networks...  I believe thats where this information was obtained. Is that enough to appease your curiosity on the subject? Wish I could give more atm but I am not willing to give him more exposure than necessary. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry. xD  I can give you a few tidbits and leads with different stuff partially based on what he said and what I have seen if you want.  His position was that the CIA was inbed with Saudi to the extent that Saudi was the CIA&#39;s &quot;Dog&quot;.  I originally strongly doubted they had this close of relationship but a couple things that made me reconsider is that 1. US was reluctant under Obama to attack the ISIS Oil lines... (There is an article about how we finally attacked the trucks) 2.  USA obviously has a base or something to that effect in Saudi Arabia... (Trump actually accidentally leaked this in the campaign I think....... You would think that Trump accidentally leaking Classified info would be HUGE news right? but the media immediately dropped the story almost like they were told to move on... :p  3. Pretty clear USA-Saudi-Israel were working together to destabilize the middle east outside of the few countries allied with them. It&#39;s definitely no accident the whole apple cart outside of Syria and Iran were being upset for years...  Israel has been trying to downplay their close ties with Saudi but its pretty obvious when you see Hannity bring it up with Netanyahu....     Anyway, just saw your older post about it.  ISIS is not working alone. The Saudi Royal family is rather large and obviously wealthy. Apparently several different royals were sympathetic and funding/working with ISIS.  I am also not sure if the Muslim Brotherhood has any ties directly with ISIS but they have a pretty expansive network. (Which the US govt under Obama seemed involved with as well... ) Either way, it&#39;s pretty clear ISIS was getting help from state actors  whether it just be the sympathetic, uber wealthy Saudi Royals, or USA/Israel, Or (most likely) all 3...  When you have that kind of $$ and power backing you a lot of different solutions to issues become available. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t need reasons,  I just cite the history of humans over the last 3000 years.    Most humans were still tribal and migratory 3000 years ago.   </p>

<p>Sure,  there was a point when more than 50% of the land was owned and controlled by people with police powers,  but that is actually pretty recent.</p>

<p>Of course there have been certain places where most people had been living under feudal systems for thousands of years,  no doubt,  but even most of those systems have undergone massive transformation.   The question you are posing,  one of wealth inequality,  just ask one question:   If you confiscated the wealth of the top 1% of wealthy in the US,  how many years could it fund the federal budget of the US?    Do you know the answer?</p>

<p>The Intercept exist in 2013</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It was founded in 2013 but launched in Feb of 2014 based on funding from E Bay multibillionaire,   and &quot;owning&quot; the Snowden material from 2013 that it has still not released.    Some say that it a cash cow for Omidyar who takes payoffs to NOT release information people pay to keep secret.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I look to Assange 100 times more than to Snowden.    Obviously,  Snowden has not been complaining that Greenwald sold out to Omydar (that 90% of Snowden&#39;s material has never been released)   and also anyone already knew the NSA was spying on everyone since the mid 199o&#39;s and already had proof of who did 9/11.</p>

<p>Julian on the other hand has been consistently releasing tons of material from multiple sources and has done more to threaten the deep state,  and has paid a higher price for it.   I don&#39;t fully trust Julian,  but then I don&#39;t fully trust Corbett either.</p>

<p>See,  these are alternative media outlets,  Julian and Corbett,  they are not sources.    Snowden is a source.   You rate sources one way,  and you rate media outlets another way.    Among media outlets,  you should be comparing Wikileaks and Corbett to the MSM,   or to other alternative media outlets like Alex Jones,  in which case both Julian and Corbett  shine in comparison.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t trust people who are overly critical of Wikileaks or Corbett.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Corbett is hardly a media outlet, lol.  He&#39;s one single dude in a tiny apartment in Japan with his wife and children. </p>

<p>That said, he&#39;s very careful and doesn&#39;t make wild claims without backing them up with detailed sources and a lot of research.  I trust him more than just about any other &quot;alternative media&quot; source.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A media outlet like Corbett does his own research and reporting and presents content.    Corbett is not a source like Snowden is.</p>

<p>There are big media outlets and small ones.   Where would you rather go,  Corbett or CNN?    Lots of money doesn&#39;t mean you are better.  LOL</p>

    <div class="md"><p>BS.   The incriminations are piled high like a mountain of stench.   No one important gets indicted because there is no rule of law that hasn&#39;t been thoroughly corrupted.
