        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Just goes to show how polarized the media has become. I feel like there are two entirely different media ecosystems going on, and each is talking right past the other. Each hating the strawman of the other&#39;s side, and cherry-picking the best of their own side. Tribalism in a nutshell.</p>

<p>But I worry about the breakdown in honest communication when it seems like we have to parallel timelines going on in the news. It&#39;s getting harder and harder to distill what the central objective truth is because of the bias on both sides of the media reporting (and the memes associated with each side, as well). </p>

<p>Does anyone else see this happening? It&#39;s getting emotionally exhausting because people are getting more and more emotional and refusing to see the truths that the other side realizes are real. Each seeing half the truth, but thinking they&#39;re fully correct. Furthermore, the media is keeping people divided and conquered so they refuse to entertain the ideas of the other half, thus blinding <em>everyone</em> to at least half of the truths out there, because they refuse to entertain them because they associate those ideas with the opposite side. </p>

<p>It&#39;s very worrying though to see the &quot;heads&quot; of both parties trying to openly jail the other. But it&#39;s also understandable when nearly all of them have committed crimes... it&#39;s a spy vs spy blackmail situation, like a mexican stand-off. Each trying to have a strong offence as their main defense. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t like the two parallel media worlds, because it makes people hate each other. It creates a situation where if you can find any attribute of that person that casts them as a proponent of the side you don&#39;t like, then you may stop being friends with them or worse. The media is trying to goad people in to this way of thinking. &quot;Oh she&#39;s pro-gay, she must be a Hillary/DNC supporter&quot; or &quot;Oh he likes guns, he must be a Trump/RNC supporter&quot; and it makes us oversimplify each other, just like our news is oversimplified. And then we turn to hate out of frustration (and because the media are pushing our emotional buttons) as we &quot;simply can&#39;t understand&quot; why person on the other side would be on that side... we begin assuming they must be dumb, or even worse sub-human or evil. This attitude, multiplied across millions of people (via a media network) is exactly what causes a civil war. </p>

<p>So if we truly wish to avoid war, we must constantly work to overcome this top-down messaging system that takes advantage of our natural emotional responses to things, in order to shape our behaviors to further empower those who already have power. </p>

<p>I feel like people are sleepwalking right in to doom. But I also think the media <em>wants</em> me to think that, so I&#39;m not sure how true it actually is. Can anyone relate? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>People on the left have been saying Trump should go to prison since he was nominated and said he would put Hillary in prison. I saw 2 posts about it on the front page today, not to mention the dozens of posts about impeaching him for the Russia ties. While on conservative sites all they talk about is the 20% nuclear deal Hillary did with Putin, and dismiss all allegations about Trump. It&#39;s like neither side will even entertain the argument of the other side, and I find this terrifying. </p>

<p>There is nothing of the such in the comment you quoted.  It says that this is the probably the first of many indictments, which is probably true.</p>

<p>A seasoned investigator and prosecutor isn&#39;t going to blow his load on the first round of indictments, but nothing was even implied about Trump getting charged.</p>

I didn&#39;t vote in 2016 for professional reasons but i wanted Trump to win, ONLY because he was the only anti-establishment (barely) candidate with enough personal clout to rid the gov top tiers of the corruption.

    <div class="md"><p>I feel you on the demonization aspect of it for sure. The blood curdling screams of contempt for Trump don&#39;t even come close to the last Republican president who was protested from the start and called a Nazi. Clinton has had a significant role in government misconduct. Yet she gets a near total pass from the media. It makes it all the more difficult to gauge the crimes of the current administration when the crimes of the previous one are obscured.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your comment is the only one I&#39;ve read thus far that has ANY truth in it.
Let me give you pieces to the puzzle,
There is no &quot;previous administration&quot;. Look at George W. Bush and the fictional story of his time as President. Terrorists, most of which are Saudi Arabian destroy mountains of criminal finance investigative documentation at the WTC, plus destroying the specific area of the Pentagon where the government was investigating itself for losing over 2 TRILLION dollars, but we fixed all of this by creating a war on terrorism, so we destroy Afghanistan and Iraq&#39;s authorities, and kill lots of innocent civilians, whose&#39; families then vow revenge, and chant death to USA. So then we &quot;elect&quot; Obama, who wants to stop waging wars in the middle-east, and then uses U.S. assets to destroy Libya and Syria. I can&#39;t even continue to type this ridiculous fiction out, it&#39;s so bad and blatant.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. It reminds me a lot of the election: hyper polarized camps where people couldn&#39;t even talk because nobody could agree on the color of the sky. And without a basic reality on which to agree, it was impossible to discuss anything. </p>

<p><a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> is practically a different planet to here in terms of conversation. That said, I still hold it&#39;s mostly astroturfed and manufactured conversation--go back to the Wayback machine headlines and there were actually sane political discussions in early 2016. But today... bifurcated realities. </p>

<p>The sad part is everyone wants the same thing: less corruption, our constitution functioning, democracy, and a better life for themselves and loved ones. Discussing anything other than how best to achieve this is like partaking in the bread and circus show. But we&#39;re hemmed into these parameters (or at least, they&#39;re the limitations we&#39;ve come to accept). </p>

<p>At the end of the day nobody really knows wtf is going on. As you said, it&#39;s all spy vs spy blackmail where things are negotiated behind the scenes, far outside of the average man&#39;s purview. We get to guess and speculate, all while shouting to others that our view is somehow the more informed one. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>r/conspiracy went off the rails in mid-2016. It&#39;s nice to see a comment affirming that sometime last year was when reddit was subverted. It was very clear to me, and in a slightly earlier time, I think it would have been a major and uncontested topic of conversation in the subs, but now it&#39;s like visiting crazy town here.

People just want to think they know better than others, and will try and cast anyone they dislike in to a mold they can justifiably ignore, that way they never have to learn anything or think, they can just rest on their emotional and ideological haunches, and enjoy the manufactured feeling that they&#39;re superior to everyone else. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>I feel like people are sleepwalking right in to doom. But I also think the media wants me to think that, so I&#39;m not sure how true it actually is. Can anyone relate?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes. I think your hunch is right that the media may be exaggerating the extent of the division. I can intuit that there is in fact a silent majority that has awakened to the deceptive tactics of the two-party system. The time to speak up is now and I have observed that many are in fact doing so. I used to see popular subs like r/worldnews and r/news be completely overrun by shills and while they still do control the narratives, there are comments like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/78fiks/monsanto_faces_blowback_over_cancer_coverup">these</a> that speak to my point about a people becoming more vocal about the fuckery that&#39;s been afoot. </p>

<p>And just today, I saw <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/QuotesPorn/comments/797mek/i_would_rather_have_questions_that_cant_be/?utm_content=comments&amp;amp;utm_medium=hot&amp;amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;amp;utm_name=QuotesPorn">this post</a> which I took as a nod to us, conspiracy theorists or critical thinkers at the least(which I believe aren&#39;t so different anyway) and it gave me some hope. Especially because that sub is full of really intelligent commenters who had generally shunned any kind of conspiracy talk.</p>

<p>Lastly, I want to say that the Millennials/youth are also incredibly &#39;woke,&#39; due to having access to so much information. The other day, I had a conversation with a 13 year old who started about the Mandela Effect, HAARP, and the New World Order, and when I asked him how he knew all of this, to my amazement he responded with, &quot;I&#39;m awake.&quot;</p>

<p>As I said, I can intuit that there is a silent majority that has awakened to the shenanigans of TPTB and it&#39;s only a matter of time for the critical mass to hit where the silent majority will shift into a vocal and indignant majority.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with everything you say, I have big hope about the future. Things can&#39;t be like this forever. There is an information war waging, and that fact is becoming more and more obvious to more people. </p>

<p>I&#39;d like to add the caveat though that the Mandela Effect is TAVISTOCK disinformation, it&#39;s one of their primary pieces of disinformation. The goal is to get people not to trust their reality, and to question things on a level to which we would have no control anyway, which keeps them from noting the <em>actual</em> conspiracies that are going on with human beings on earth. Something we might actually be able to do something about. My 2 cents on the matter, just wanted to say that bit. </p>

<p>But that minor quibble aside, I agree that people are waking up, and despite their best attempts to control the narrative, lots of people are putting 2 and 2 together and seeing what is truly happening. Good for that kid, and I hope there&#39;s more like him that have the curiosity to delve in to this stuff, even though there is emotional pressure created in mainstream society to look away from these types of ideas. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m definitely not a subscriber to the Mandela Effect. Ironically, Tavistock&#39;s disinfo campaign may be backfiring if it&#39;s getting kids a reason to go down the rabbit hole, at least in the case of the 13 year old I spoke to. But I definitely see your point that it can distract the masses an shift the focus away from the actual conspiracies that are right in front of our faces.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey thanks a lot, I appreciate the kind words. </p>

<p>I agree it&#39;s backfiring in some ways, because people will start looking at things in a different way that may make them more open to other truths later. And it&#39;s good to think things through, even if an idea seems outrageous. These are all good skills to develop, so I can see how it would backfire.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bingo. </p>

<p>Clinton dynasty vs Trump dynasty is a real thing, but it&#39;s also a smaller game in the context of the Rothschilds, deep state, and federal reserve, who are likely funding both sides, because the conflict exemplifies the control technique of divide and conquer. </p>

<p>Just like they fund both sides of many international proxy wars. It&#39;s a way to sell weapons, and to destabilize governments that you wish to overthrow. Soros, the CIA, and others, have used this technique to destroy and overthrow nations all over the world. </p>

<p>I know just how hard it is not to do this though as I am not free from my own bias myself, but at least I am aware of this. I try my best to expose myself to the opinions of people with other perspective no matter how angry it makes me, because I know that anger is just an emotion response and that it may not be rational to judge people based on how I &quot;feel&quot; about them. You have to be aware that you may not even be responsible for your own reactions, your psychology is not easily influenced by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingroups_and_outgroups">group think</a>.</p>

<p>The media knows how to push your buttons, they are aware of human psychology and will use it to grab as much attention as they can: <a href="https://blog.bufferapp.com/headline-strategies-psychology">Some examples</a></p>

<p>I feel like the media is constantly pushing for harsher dialogue, using more emotive and divisive words, for example:</p>

<p>I mean honestly, this is not entirely clear. It&#39;d be nice if it were so clean cut, and Clinton has certainly done worse things as secretary of state (like selling uranium to the Russians), but Trump doesn&#39;t exactly have clean hands either. None of the high-level politicians do. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There may not be any evidence <em>yet</em> of Trump committing a crime, but there&#39;s a lot of evidence of his administration, and especially his campaign, having possibly committed crimes.</p>

<p>Also, you claim that it was a &quot;fake&quot; dossier used to wiretap Manafort et. al. when that couldn&#39;t be further from the truth.  The wiretaps came before the dossier and are legitimate.</p>

<p>It&#39;s very clear which side you stand on, even if you don&#39;t want to admit it.  However, no amount of deflection will stop actually real investigations.  We&#39;ll have the first person(s) in bracelets come Monday.</p>

One thing that keeps me hopeful is I think a lot of people realize what is happening, and with any luck maybe younger generations see through the bullshit as well.   Just like how Hollywood is imploding now because people realize how many lying scumbags are in Hollywood, maybe they will start to look at news media and others in the same way.  It&#39;s in their best interest to keep us divided.</p>

<p>However, biases and such don&#39;t change basic facts.</p>

<p>You can&#39;t deny that Nunes is simply running interference.  Him being the head of a Congressional investigation is, and has been, an absolute farce.  I have slightly more respect for Trey Gowdy, but he&#39;s also an extremely partisan hack.  This is evidenced by his so called hard stance on law and order and his near radio silence on the Trump admin.</p>

<p>So yeah, relegate me to an <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> kind of person, but also realize that no amount of deflection, name-calling, or grand standing will make Mueller&#39;s investigation disappear.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I couldn&#39;t agree more with you. I started off on the &#39;liberal&#39; side and that was the echo chamber I was in and I just couldn&#39;t understand movements like Trump and Brexit etc. I did get close to falling into the trap of just thinking all those people must be completely dumb and brainwashed or something, because there was NOTHING in the information that was provided to me through media, social media etc, that would come close to explaining why anyone would vote for Trump, it seemed insane. So I made a concerted effort to go and follow Trump supporters on social media, to try and break out of my echo chamber and to understand. And what I found out was eye opening to say the least.</p>

<p>Now I can see both sides and I see happening exactly what you say is happening. People are starting to dehumanize one another, because they have no idea why the &#39;opposing side&#39; thinks the way they think, because no one sees what the other side sees. And no one seems to make the effort to seek and evaluate evidence - people jump on and accept any story that supports their previously held view without checking to see what the sources are, whether there is actually any hard evidence etc.</p>

<p>And the truth is, which I have also noticed, is that at heart, both sides want the same things. We are all being played. Both sides want peace, both sides want freedom and for people to be able to live healthy lives and have loving relationships, to protect their families and raise children in a good world. Both sides realise that this &#39;dream&#39; is under threat, but neither side really knows who exactly is threatening it, and that&#39;s where the issue lies because they&#39;re being convinced that the enemy is each other, when the true enemy is something much bigger and something that straddles both sides.</p>

<p>Mainstream journalists have a lot to answer for here. They have become lazy, they don&#39;t fact check, they allow their own social media echo chambers and their personal social circles to influence them too much and they don&#39;t take the necessary steps to ensure that they&#39;re not being biased. They haven&#39;t got a clue about how biased they are. I know it&#39;s the same with alternative media to an extent, but the mainstream has really originated the problem by not being representative enough or honest enough. </p>

<p>When we debate with people, when we see someone whose point of view seems completely insane and difficult to understand, we HAVE to remember that these people are still people, just like us, and ultimately they want the same things we do, and that we actually have a common enemy, and that enemy is corruption in government, business, banking etc. It isn&#39;t each other. We have to stop dehumanizing each other becuase it&#39;s just so wrong and can only lead to bad things. Try to maintain feeling so of love and respect towards people even if they believe things that seem insane to you!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because of facts. The claims are baseless. Try me. Did Clinton get paid by Russia? No. Did the Uranium leave the country (maybe to Russia)? No. Did the deal hinge on Hillary&#39;s approval? No. Did the government sell the uranium to the Russians? No. There is no crime that has been committed, and this non-crime isn&#39;t even tied to Hillary. This is simply the hundredth lie to come out of the right wing that smears their political opponents. Remember the birth certificate? Remember death panels? Remember Benghazi and buttery males? This is another turd they&#39;re squeezing out, hoping that people who don&#39;t educate themselves will swallow it whole. This is, of course, how they try to distract the public from the fact that their President is a corrupt Russian puppet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is the real conspiracy IMHO. Divided people are easier to control. People like being tribal. The parties benefit from sharp divisions between people the same way the media does. &quot;You&#39;re not one of THEM are you? Then you follow these talking points.&quot; If people start straying too far, make them fear being ostracized by their tribe.  This way the parties and mainstream media get loyal audiences. The parties know that they have to wait 8 years max before the pendulum awnings their direction again, maybe sooner. In the meantime everyone is nearly controlled. The media provides indoctrination in exchange for a candid audience for their advertisers. This is why politicians and the media both HATE third parties and are terrified of news being handled by social channels. </p>

<p>I also believe that the divide and conquer strategy has begun to backfire. The divides are too deep. At this point true catastrophe might be what it takes to bring Americans (and other countrymen) back from the brink. Good luck with that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For one, I don&#39;t think the left care about defending Hillary nearly as much as the right thinks the left does.  </p>

<p>For two, the right has been dogmatically going after Hillary for 25 years.  She&#39;s already had a special prosecutor look all up in Whitewater and look deeply into any possible role she may have had in Vince Foster&#39;s suicide.  She&#39;s faced seven Congressional investigations into Benghazi and an FBI investigation into her handling of government emails.  </p>

<p>Thus far, she&#39;s never been charged with anything.  At this point, it&#39;s hard for the left to manufacture anymore outrage about something Hillary might have done, since the right, over multiple attempts, have woefully failed to prove any allegation against her.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s getting emotionally exhausting because people are getting more and more emotional and refusing to see the truths that the other side realizes are real. Each seeing half the truth, but thinking they&#39;re fully correct. Furthermore, the media is keeping people divided and conquered so they refuse to entertain the ideas of the other half, thus blinding everyone to at least half of the truths out there, because they refuse to entertain them because they associate those ideas with the opposite side.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Finally, someone who understands what&#39;s actually going on here. The left sees certain things the right doesn&#39;t get and the right sees certain things the left doesn&#39;t get. And the government exploits their lack of self awareness about this to divide us. They know we&#39;re stronger as a united force, so they give us every reason in the book to fight each other as a distraction. My politics are odd to where somw people don&#39;t even know it&#39;s possible for me to hold some of the positions I do, because they don&#39;t think there&#39;s a middle ground, only the two big extremes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People on the left have been saying Trump should go to prison since he was nominated and said he would put Hillary in prison. I saw 2 posts about it on the front page today, not to mention the dozens of posts about impeaching him for the Russia ties. While on conservative sites all they talk about is the 20% nuclear deal Hillary did with Putin, and dismiss all allegations about Trump. It&#39;s like neither side will even entertain the argument of the other side, and I find this terrifying. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>His constant tweeting that makes him look like an ass?</p>

<p>His harmful rhetoric on North Korea?</p>

<p>His inability to admit wrong?</p>

<p>His damn near praising of white supremacists?</p>

<p>The firings of key officials?</p>

<p>The Paris Climate Accord?</p>

<p>Also, we have few things to criticize about Trump because he really has done anything other than eliminate Obama-era EOs.</p>
