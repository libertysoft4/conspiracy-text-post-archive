        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Just a short anecdote from when I worked on HoC in Baltimore with Spacey. I&#39;m sure this will not surprise anyone. </p>

<p>Worked as a freelance PA... running around doing multiple jobs for cast, crew, extras, office. I interacted with many of the cast members. All (for the most part) were very nice. A couple times I was asked by Spacey&#39;s assistant (who was a gay male) to fetch something for the star. However, right after Spacey caught wind there was another <em>very young</em> male PA, I specifically told to let this young man handle any requests for Spacey. No matter what, I was supposed to get that PA-- even if he was right in the middle of another job. </p>

<p>One night, KS (kind of oddly) came out with us to a bar in Adams Morgan. He wasn&#39;t invited, pretty much just crew members. It was weird...but who was going to tell Kevin Spacey he couldn&#39;t join us? The entire night he was all over the young PA and just about every other young guy there. I never heard this myself, but a male co-worker told me Spacey asked him to his hotel, whispering &quot;how would you like your first time to be with an Oscar winner?&quot;-- or something to that effect. I guess he just assumed he was a virgin. LOL I have no idea why-- he was 25. </p>

<p>Many ppl from the set will probably come out with stories like these. Or already have... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just my opinion, but I don&#39;t know if this had much to do with KS gaining the satisfaction of &quot;turning&quot; a guy. More to do with the power aspect. He seemed to use the Oscar thing as a way to feel more important...on more than one occasion. I&#39;m not saying any of his behavior was &quot;right&quot;, but he did come to work prepared and didn&#39;t delay filming at least-- which is a personal pet peeve.  </p>

<p>This is not a fake story. I lived in DC/Baltimore/Arlington/Alexandria for over 7 years. I made the commute (along with many other local actors BTW) to Baltimore daily. If you&#39;ve ever lived in the area, you&#39;d know it&#39;s not exactly that far. There&#39;s a reason many people refer to it as DC/Baltimore. </p>

<p>Furthermore, if you&#39;ve ever been to Baltimore you&#39;d know it&#39;s not really the type of city where people &quot;go out&quot; (with the exception of the Inner Harbor). </p>

<p>Finally, do you REALLY think celebs don&#39;t go to bars/restaurants outside of Hollywood? Do you think it&#39;s always the &quot;talk of the town&quot;? The National Enquirer doesn&#39;t report every time RW or KS goes anywhere in DC or Baltimore. There wasn&#39;t anything ABNORMAL about KS being seen out in DC. Everyone knew he was filming HoC at that point. And, as I mentioned, his homosexuality was an open secret on-set. The pass he made wasn&#39;t announced to the entire cast and crew for heaven&#39;s sake!</p>

<p>Oh, and this was posted on r/conspiracy AFTER I posted on this board. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/79zy7n/someone_working_for_kevin_spacey_gives_disturbing/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/79zy7n/someone_working_for_kevin_spacey_gives_disturbing/</a></p>

<p>Sound familiar? </p>

<p>I understand this is the &quot;conspiracy&quot; board. But, I really don&#39;t think my experience is that hard to believe. Especially because I&#39;m not claiming he molested little boys in front of everyone. I just thought this was an interesting story I would share. Believe it, don&#39;t believe it. But, I don&#39;t really think your reasoning is all that solid-- especially after my explanation above. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wasn&#39;t really saying that there was anything &quot;wrong&quot; with it...I&#39;m sorry if I portrayed it in that way. </p>

<p>However, I do believe it does show he had a propensity for hitting on underage looking men. I only know him from these brief encounters, but I wish he had the courage to come out in a way that the LGBT community could be proud (and these allegations weren&#39;t true for that matter). It must be incredibly difficult for anyone. But, this isn&#39;t the way to do it IMO. </p>

<p>Also, his actions made my co-worker very uncomfortable and I cannot imagine KS wouldn&#39;t see that. Yet he continued his pursuit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey, thanks. I really appreciate your response on this. I do think there&#39;s some (a lot?) of exaggeration going on here made by straight males...I&#39;m taking it all with lots of salt.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not gay myself and not really plugged into the community. I was just curious if it was actually &quot;a thing&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Please see above. As I understand it, there&#39;s many other stories that have been posted on the internet that posters have found to be cut and paste from somewhere else or just plain far out. </p>

<p>I wish more people understood the Baltimore/DC area and it&#39;s not exactly like saying we were filming in Hollywood and we went out in Vegas the same night. The 2 reasons the above poster gave are quite ridiculous and don&#39;t disprove anything. Granted, I have given you no photos or anything. And, it&#39;s up to you to believe it or not. However, it&#39;s really unfair to do that based on the fact the above poster thinks Baltimore is so far away from AM that my story is impossible to believe. And/or the paps (that I&#39;ve never seen in DC) would be all over KS... </p>

<p>I hope you will reconsider, based on what I&#39;ve just told you. I&#39;d appreciate it. Thank you. </p>
