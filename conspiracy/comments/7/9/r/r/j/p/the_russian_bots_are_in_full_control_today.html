<p>Lock him the fuck up for all I care.  Conservatives have this mistaken impression that liberals care what happens to Tony Podesta.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I do not believe that conservative or liberal self identified persons (hundreds of millions in each group worldwide) have any same mistaken impression nor do I believe that all liberals have the same level of caring what happens to Tony Podesta.</p>

<p>If you deny the parallel though, it&#39;s a bit cheap.  John Podesta is/ was/always will be associated with the Podesta Lobby Group.  He was managing Clinton&#39;s campaign until the very end.  Lobbyists are as successful as their connections are close to the powerful.  Having a brother working in the White House, closely aligned with the Clintons and eventually managing an all but guaranteed winning presidential campaign is the driving attraction for the Podesta Group.</p>

<p>If Manafort is guilty of collusion and you think that also makes Trump guilty of collusion, it can be argued that the same guilt by association applies to Clinton and it really doesn&#39;t matter who we had in the White House, they were both traitors.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He&#39;s right. Part of Trump&#39;s strategy has been to talk about Hillary, and even Obama, as much as possible. There is no logical reason in doing this unless he were trying to create a diversion from something else. He has done it consistently since his election. We are nearly a year after and that&#39;s all he seems to talk about. Surely, if he were delivering on his promises to his supporters, he would be talking about that, but no, he focuses only on attacking. That&#39;s a sign of something up to me.</p>
