    <div class="md"><p>Not OP, but at least part of it is wrong. The lobby they worked for, was not in any way a democratic lobby, Podesta has many businesses and not all of them are political. Collusion with Russia is indeed all but confirmed, however we have learned certain new facts in the Papadopoulos confession, that will undoubtedly lead to a continuation of the investigation concerning possible collusion. However then, ironically you name three other conspiracies that are not in any way proven beyond reasonable doubt as of yet as being the truth.</p>

Of course in their involvement in working with Russians, for the Democratic lobby, years before Trump, they also laundered money, didn&#39;t report earnings, funneled money into funky accounts, etc. I assume that is the additional information that you somehow feel invalidates the characterization of simply colluding with Russians.</p>

<p>Papadopoulos admits that he previously lied to FBI about the timing and significance of numerous contacts he had with persons connected to Russian government. He now admits they occurred after he joined the Trump campaign as policy advisor.

    <div class="md"><p>Ah yes, good ole Bloomberg. Any type of MSM messaging/narrative, especially about Trump, can be safely ignored until you see irrefutable proof. Right now, it&#39;s their word. We already know the FBI is insanely corrupt (see: vegas shooting) and Mueller, being a former FBI director, thus has a conflict of interest in this case. </p>

<p>Just that article alone already has glaring falsehoods, as they claim the indictments of Manafort and Gates &quot;show how Russians attempted to influence key Trump aides&quot; when those indictments are for actions taken years prior, long before they worked on the Trump campaign. See the spin? Can&#39;t be trusted. </p>
