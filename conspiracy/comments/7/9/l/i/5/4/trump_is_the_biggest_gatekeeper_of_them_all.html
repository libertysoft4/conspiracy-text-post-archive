<ol>
<li><p>Promised to release ALL the JFK files.</p></li>
<li><p>Only released SOME, which included absolutely no new information that we didn&#39;t know before.</p></li>
<li><p>Claims on Twitter that by his doing he &quot;finally&quot; put an end to the conspiracy.</p></li>
<li><p>All the conspiracy theorists who are also President Trump supporters buy it, and will therefore believe anything that comes out of his mouth.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>This is a one hundred percent gatekeeping tactic, and since he&#39;s the President he can use that power to abuse and influence other people. </p>

<p>The President of the United States has unbelievable access to archives that contain many of the secrets we in this sub are trying to figure out.</p>

<p>Yet some still continue to blindly worship him.</p>

<p>Stop using feelings to worship the guy, use critical thinking, and you&#39;ll release that he&#39;s a complete fraud, the biggest gatekeeper of the entire history of gatekeeping.</p>
