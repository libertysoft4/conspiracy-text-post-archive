    <div class="md"><p>Cool. But, that doesn&#39;t not mean civil war!!! Civil war means people arming themselves and killing their neighbors. It&#39;s not a north south thing anymore. Who&#39;s the enemy? Who are people supposed to go kill? Democrats vs. Republicans? Stop it. That is ridiculous. People don&#39;t care that much. I don&#39;t know anyone that is willing to bare arms right now.</p>

<p>The only possible way this could go down is the people vs. the government. And, with that comes secessions--no one is prepared for that. </p>

<p>It could be a race thing, party, class....lots of options.  Also maybe not a physical was but possibly an economic war or mental?  Keeping people divided is good for big businesses/government </p>

<p>I am no way advocating violence and my thread was just figuratively stating the situation as extreme and obviously it being r/conspiracy I wanted to see if anyone has thought about the possibility.  </p>

<p>Just a heads up this is already happening. On both sides.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>A left-wing protester was killed by a nazi. Both the left and right inflict violence on each other. Both are arming with guns. Leftists constantly engage in violent conflicts with police. Police regularly kill protesters.</p>

<p>Things are happening, just not quite on a wide scale yet.</p>

<p>It&#39;ll be the left vs the right with gov.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I used to say, &quot;there&#39;s no way we could have a civil war with the NFL being on Sundays&quot;. Better lace them boots.</p>

<hr/>

<p>In reality, there will be no civil war on a mainstream scale. If I go to war, I won&#39;t be able to pay my mortgage and will lose my house. American&#39;s have netflix, cell phones and porn. Why would they wanna go fight in trenches?</p>

<p>What I can see is more rallies vs counter rallies and I can see these getting deadly fast. I can find a gullible idiot in a group of 1,000 people and that&#39;s all it takes to kill serious people.</p>

<p>It was a great idea. Almost all of us Trumpers hate the anthem protests and I think a lot of Dems don&#39;t like it either. We didn&#39;t have anyone speaking up for us about our thoughts on it, and now we have President Trump doing it for us.</p>
