    <div class="md"><p>I keep circling back to your point. However, most of the files that were released were more than likely altered and most deemed unusable. Given the nature of whom the file keepers have been., I highly doubt that The CIA, FBI and Homeland Security would implicate themselves as criminals. We are at a volatile time such as the time we are currently living in. Not to mention the fact that thousands of very important doc.&#39;s have yet to be released. I think it&#39;s almost a certainty that they either released what was convenient for their agenda or are using this date to their advantage. This is what I call &quot;shiny red balloons&quot;...as in, &quot;Hey! Look over here at these lovely red balloons , so one can&#39;t look away and see the truth of our current state&quot;.  This was a prime time for a good distraction to keep America&#39;s brightest minds busy, so other more threatening matters aren&#39;t being addressed. Hmm...Nov 4th ring a bell? How about the many references to Russia...? Lovely timing, don&#39;t you think? It&#39;s just...curious, I suppose. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>At the end of the day it all depends how the media in US covers this whole issue. If they straight out say that FBI and CIA failed to prevent this (and this won’t be the first time they failed at their job) some people might get concerned. It’s unlikely they will say this though. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They held these documents back all these years for a reason. Believe what you will but intelligence agencies dont give out information unless it fits some type of narrative they are pushing. They didnt want any of these files out. People long dead decided this info was too sensitive for the public and even now people who had nothing to do with rhe assassination are still pushing to keep some of it secret. This is real. Dots need to be connected. Carefull study of the files has to take place before any judgements can be made. We actually owe Donald Trump a thank you for doing what probably no other President would have. This may be the only positive thing he does for the public as President. </p>
