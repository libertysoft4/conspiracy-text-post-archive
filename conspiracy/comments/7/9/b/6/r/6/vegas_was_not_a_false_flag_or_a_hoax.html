As it stands, we are just seeing something gone wrong, probably inside our intelligence branches, or the complete ineptitude of law enforcement in the United States. Neither one is that good of a scenario. They are wanting to hush it up rather than promote an agenda, and that tells me that it wasn&#39;t a planned false flag or hoax as some conspiracy minded people think. Just my two cents. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re speculating that since the outcome of the event isn&#39;t unilateral gun confiscation or something obvious like that, therefore we know it was not a false flag. </p>

<p>Whereas, in the realm of evidence, we look at the event itself and see if it has the 3D appearance of a real shooting, and of course it does not, for many reasons, not the least of which being that there is still literally no evidence of anything or anyone having been shot.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My suggestion to you is simple. Go take a few psychology courses. Go sit in on some victims groups. Go fucking educated yourself on tolls of grief. While you are at it...educate yourself on grieving while in the spotlight. Do something other than assume you know wtf is going on and calling victims liars. It is VERY common to laugh through tears...I&#39;m sure you have even heard the term before. Fuck of all with all this bullshit. There is video of people getting shot. There are lawsuits. Wtf more do you want? Nothing would change the thoughts of the demented. And that is what you are. You must be to call victims liars when you have absolutely ZERO proof other than YOUR sick ass opinion.</p>

<p>These are things based in FACT no just some idea that people are crisis actors. Psychology easily explains what you keep trying to assume isn&#39;t normal..when in fact it is one of the most normal of raw emotions. You are doing a disservice to yourself by relying on yt to reach you things. Get up, get out and go learn it in the real world. There are a million sources that explain to you what you see in the video you love to reference. However, your crisis actor bullshit is conjecture and has no reality behind it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You dupe yourself by relying on yt as your educational source. Surely you must realize that anyone can make a video and call it fact. However, psychology is based on years of research and human behavioral studies that show without a doubt that nervous laughter in the time of grief or stress is 100% normal. Anyone that is an objective thinker would put some research into the flip side of their own ideas. Which you clearly haven&#39;t done. You only source yt videos that aren&#39;t at all related to the events in question. You can&#39;t prove their were crisis actors there. You need to have facts to back up your theory and you have nothing other than opinion and conjecture. Until you can show that the person you are calling a crisis actor is 100% a crisis actor by proof..then you are only assuming based on your opinion. Find a video, website, photo of the person you make the claim against being a known crisis actor then you have a leg to stand on. </p>

<p>Maybe try stepping out of your shadow box and consider the question of what. went. wrong. Because whoever was in charge of the thing clearly dropped the fucking ball, bigly. To suggest the entire event was successfully choreographed between multiple LE agencies <strong>AND</strong> Mandalay <strong>AND</strong> ISIS <strong>AND</strong> Event Security <strong>ALL TO FAKE KILL PEOPLE?</strong> then I think maybe you should take a creative writing class because that shit stinks. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, absolutely they were added later even if they are bullet holes, which is extremely unclear. </p>

<p>I assumed at some point we would see pictures of things with holes n them, but that is even weaker and less convincing than I was expecting. </p>

<p>Imagine the carnage and damage at the site where thousands of high-caliber rounds rained down for ten minutes, and all the innumerable bullet holes in wild patterns and lines there would be.  This doesn&#39;t even come close. </p>

<p>This entire event is about the mind control tactic known as the power of suggestion: show a bunch of people running and screaming, show a thing that&#39;s supposed to be a bullet hole on a water tower, and let people&#39;s imaginations fill in the rest so that they are convinced there was actually a horrific mass shooting on this grand scale.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. Even if those marks are on the Vegas fuel tanks, there&#39;s no reason to believe they were caused by live rounds and no reason to believe they weren&#39;t either already there, or added later by some other means.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;High powered assault rifle&quot; sounds real scary...until YOU actually get off your ass and do the research into how the weapons operate once a bump stock is applied, how does the distance effect the severity of damage done, the amount of damage the specific bullet is designed to cause. That weapon with those bullets isn&#39;t even approved for deer hunting because they are designed to injure not kill (am I lying? Telling the truth? You wouldn&#39;t know because you won&#39;t learn). Stop being an internet parrot and educate yourself. A shot from that distance is not as deadly as you may think. It would need to hit major areas to cause immediate death. Please, go learn something. I&#39;m not going to keep schooling you asshat. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lmfao. Wow...you really rely on yt for your answers to life huh? Well, there are a few variables that your precious video didn&#39;t include. How about the fact that the shooter was on the 32nd floor shooting down into a crowd from a building over 300yds away? Or...how about the fact that the targets were MOVING? Oh, and lets not forget about the bump stock. Ffs you can&#39;t use this video to prove shit. Same gun perhaps but not a single one of the variables are the same. Hitting someone straight on is going to do more damage than hitting at an angle. Get off the internet and go learn some shit from source other than yt.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your own video evidence discredits your entire point. Here let me educate you so you don&#39;t look stupid again ok? That area where the is a huge white bandage (can&#39;t miss it right?) that is in fact part of the NECK! FOR FFS DO YOU NOT KNOW BASIC ANATOMY?? Why would he need a sling? A brace? Please explain? The bullet obviously didn&#39;t affect his range of motion. The last thing you want to do is restrict movement if it isnt necessary. You know what that does? Decreases muscle mass which makes it take longer for the wound to heal! Not ever single gunshot is deadly nor does it do massive damage. Most gunshots are none lethal and very treatable. Stop watching movies and YouTube. Honestly, if you want to educate yourself on things of this nature...go interview a doctor..I&#39;m sure a lot of them would be willing to speak to u if they have time. Also, unless a bullet is subject to cause more damage they don&#39;t remove them. There are many people walking around with bullets in them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Noticed. Which is one of the only reasons I don&#39;t think false flag. I don&#39;t buy for one second that he didn&#39;t have documented mental issues (just my opinion). One reason they may have swept it away to cover the fact that our mental health system is horrible...most mental health professionals no longer take insurance (a lot of plans don&#39;t cover it anyway) and if they do cover it ...you have to pay the doc and file the claim yourself to get your money back..which isn&#39;t easy to do if you don&#39;t know what you are doing. Another thing to is that this happened in Vegas...the cliche that what happens there stays there...well they kinda aren&#39;t joking. Did you hear about the shooting at Planet Hollywood there a few yrs back? Or all of the drug snuggling bust at the airport? The bombs at Luxor yrs ago? Vegas keeps their shit quiet. And when something does hit the news...it is a blip and done. Google and see...I&#39;m not joking.</p>

<p>The one thing that gave it away was how long it took the media to react to it and for all the networks to get on the same page. usually they are given a head-ups with a list of talking points.</p>

Do you really think that the government or whoever would use someone who couldn&#39;t pull off a simple cry and act sad? You are dense. Like I said...go educate yourself.
