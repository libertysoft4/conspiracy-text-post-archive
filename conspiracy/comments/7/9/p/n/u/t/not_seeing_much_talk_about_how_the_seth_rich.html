<p>What a nutty coincidence for them to &quot;bluff&quot; that they have thousands of Democratic emails months before a website that&#39;s been promoting Kremlin interests for years releases thousands of Democratic emails.  Lucky guess Vladimir!</p>

<p>Please point me to the story that&#39;s been &quot;out for a while&quot; confirming the Trump campaign heard in early spring that Russia had thousands of stolen emails and wanted to meet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I find it more believable that Seth was the source for a number of reasons. Almost immediately after Wikileaks dumped the DNC emails the Democrats started crying “Russia”. They even came up with the fake hacker “guccifer 2.0” to try to cover up the fact that they were compromised from within. It has been proven that “guccifer 2.0” is fake and did NOT hack the DNC.</p>

<p>As someone who has followed this from the beginning, I’m confident in what I believe. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This argument is pretty bad dude. How the hell would the DNC know they were hacked by Russia before it happened? You said they found out it was Russia after the leaks. No shit really? We started talking about Russian hacking and Seth Rich around the same time. Assange says he never reveals his sources but in the same breath he&#39;s like &quot;but there&#39;s this one kid that died, wink wink.&quot; What a cop out. He already has clearly suggested he&#39;s the source, even though they never reveal their sources. At this point Assange needs to prove it. He could throw this entire story out the window if he did. He could truly effect the entire world here. But he can&#39;t prove it. Because Seth wasn&#39;t his source. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You’re misunderstanding me. I didn’t say the DNC knew they were going to be hacked before it happened. I think they knew that someone working for them stole a bunch of their emails and somehow they were compromised from within. They did not know how much information was taken and when/if it might be leaked. This caused them to go into panic mode and they had to come up with a plan to cover up their blunder and make sure there would be no major news coverage of the content of the leaks.</p>

<p>They killed Seth to set an example for anyone who might think of trying the same thing he was brave enough to do. They then hatched the Guccifer 2.0 plan to go along with the “Russian’s did it” story, which was used by everyone involved in the Clinton campaign to distract from any questions regarding the content of the leaked emails.</p>

<p>Assange said as much as he could without directly coming out and saying it. You can be mad at him for that, but I admire his integrity for not wanting to reveal Wikileaks sources.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The fact that we started talking about Russian hacking after we got the leaks is completely reasonable. Because h
We didn&#39;t know Russia hacked the DNC.....until they hacked the DNC. Assange has no integrity. He told everyone his source was Seth Rich. If he had any integrity and actually wanted to keep his sources private, he would have never mentioned Seth if he was actually the source. Seth was about to go work for the Hillary campaign. He wasn&#39;t a hacker. He didn&#39;t have access to everyone&#39;s emails. There is literally no evidence that Seth was some rougue hacker that wanted to sabotage his own party. Russia told the Trump campaign they had thousands of emails that could damage Hillary&#39;s campaign. And you still think they never hacked the DNC. Sounds like some Trump fan fiction to me. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>“We” did NOT start talking about the DNC and Russian hacking at the same time. Who the fuck is “we”?</p>

<p>After Seth was murdered and Wikileaks dumped the emails, THEN we started hearing about Russian hackers on the mainstream media. Strangely enough, the MSM barely covered the <em>content</em> of the leaked DNC emails. Also strange that there were many calls for Assange to be assassinated (mainly by politicians and news pundits) immediately after the DNC leaks, and networks like CNN trying to convince it’s viewers that it’s illegal to read Wikileaks.</p>

<p>In regards to Assange, it wasn’t him who mentioned Seth. During an interview he was asked about Seth Rich. He didn’t even bring it up. He was prodded at by the reporter about it. The reporter was trying to get him to come out and say it, and he didn’t. So you’re wrong again.</p>

<p>In regards to Seth Rich, I never said he was some “rogue hacker”. Seth was already working for the Clinton campaign and had friends who were involved in IT for the campaign. It wouldn’t take a genius hacker to do what Seth did. It would have taken a flash drive, a temporary breach in some firewalls, and time to download the files. It’s not that far fetched. </p>

<p>Trump didn’t need Russia’s help to win the election. The DNC and Hillary dug their own graves when they stole the primary from Bernie, and somehow managed to run the worst campaign in the history of our country. </p>

<p>You probably didn’t read the leaked DNC emails, so you probably don’t know this, but a huge part of their campaign strategy was to “elevate the pied piper candidate”. Aka their plan was to make sure Trump became the Republican candidate so that it would be easy for Hillary to win. It backfired on them a bit, don’t ya think?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Might want to rewatch that interview buddy. Because you couldn&#39;t be more wrong. It is indeed Assange who brings up Seth Rich without being asked about him. </p>

<p>And since when taking down some firewalls give you the passwords to everyone&#39;s emails? I don&#39;t really care about rehashing the election. Hillary wasn&#39;t a good candidate and their strategy sucked. Cool. What I do care about is a current president that worked with Russia to get elected and is currently delaying sanctions on Russia for interfering in our election. The leader of the country cares more about his personal well being than the security of the country. That&#39;s what I&#39;m worried about at this point. </p>

<p>Some guy who worked for Trump said <strong>under oath</strong> Russia contacted him saying they had damaging emails on the Clintons.</p>

<p>Pretty good guess by the Russian government to know that some low-level DNC flack would leak all the DNC emails to Wikileaks a few weeks later, I suppose.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Or it could be possible that because the Democrats were incredibly careless with their information/wireless communications, their emails were not only stollen from within, but acquired by hackers as well. We may never know the whole truth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Gathering opposition data no matter how shady it was isn&#39;t a crime.  That being said it had always been Russia, they wanted money for it but Manafort while working under Trump told them to fuck off.  That ends any collusion connection between Trump and Russia.  </p>

<p>Again, Papadopoulous offered the emails to Manafort, who told him to fuck off with it.  In turn Russia leaked it to WL instead.  Papadopoulous was charged with lying to the FBI because of suspected collusion, Manafort blocked this from getting to Trump.  Manafort was then charged with Tax evasion in 2005.  </p>

<p>So again, there is no connection between Trump and Russia.  Russia only leaked the emails because they don&#39;t want Hillary to win, that is all.</p>

<p>So <em>that&#39;s</em> why nobody was bothered when the Nixon campaign ordered those guys to break into the Watergate and bug the Democrats.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Russia had nothing to do with the result of our elections. Even if the Trump campaign did try to collude with them, it had very little influence on the outcome. Sorry, but agree to disagree.</p>

<p>Way to fall for the big bad Russia narrative.</p>
