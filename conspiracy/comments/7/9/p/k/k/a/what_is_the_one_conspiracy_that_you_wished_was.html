    <div class="md"><p>My conspiracy came true...</p>

<p>I have seen a low flying black cube UFO.</p>

<p>This event occurred in 2011 and has haunted me everyday since. I work in networking and all of ours are late. I usually get off around 2am and then I am up for a few hours before I go to bed. This evening I got off work and it was raining really bad on my way home. When I got home, by chance, the clouds broke and I stepped outside to have a quick smoke. One of my buddies called me and we were chatting about work. It was still not raining and there were low lying clouds. There are orange street lights in Allen and they were reflecting off the bottom of the clouds creating an artificial light. There was a pretty good breeze whipping around, but no rain. I was facing the west and I look to my right and I see a black cube moving out of the north and traveling south at about 60-80mph. It was moving with a corner forward. This thing was huge. I was astonished to the core of my soul. I sat speechless for a few seconds knowing that I was seeing something amazing. It was 80-100ft tall. It was a black cube in shape and looked like a rough stone surface. On the side of the cube was a border and within the border was a circular symbol, if that&#39;s what it even was. It looked like if you were to draw a circular maze. It was disturbing the air behind it and created a vaporous trail spinning behind it and then disappearing. There was absolutely no sound. None. If you know Dallas, it was traveling in the direction of southbound 75Central Expressway towards downtown. I told my buddy what I had seen and he lives a few miles south. I fumbled over my words telling him and asked him to go outside to see if he could see it. He went out to the middle of his street and looked in the direction that it was coming from. After about 5 minutes it started to rain again. He stood out in the rain for another 15 minutes but never saw it. Good friend..lol.. Anyways, no one can ever tell me that I didn&#39;t see what I saw that night. I have been ridiculed and laughed at, but I know what I saw. It is almost a relief at this point to know that they are really here. I have been a long time lurker and I had to get this off of my chest. I have been searching &quot;black cube ufo&quot; for years now, every single day. I cannot stop thinking about it. I have to see it again. Thanks for listening. edit:Allen, TX (near Dallas) It looked like the entire cube was carved from a single stone. It had a border along its edges and a circular pattern in the middle. Think of a view of a circular maze from above. Also of interesting note, no lights from the craft either. I was expecting a light show, but I will settle with what I got to witness any day. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/2pgjxw/i_have_seen_a_low_flying_black_cube_ufo/">https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/2pgjxw/i_have_seen_a_low_flying_black_cube_ufo/</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/5q6uwf/my_low_flying_black_cube_ufo_encounter_in/">https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/5q6uwf/my_low_flying_black_cube_ufo_encounter_in/</a> I think they are the Archons...
P.S. The &quot;Texas Black Cube&quot; pics you see all over the internet are a proven hoax. It always bugs me that it gained so much traction.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I found this and thought of you:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>AI.  (Artificial Intelligence)</p>

<p>The dark spark.  The natural physical Universe seems to have its own challenge to overcome.  As above, so below, as they say.</p>

<p>One created several.  Their subjects created more.  Now all developed beings deal with them.</p>

<p>Many governments have their own, even smaller programs, which the shadow government controls.  Some planets are infected as a whole by them.  Some control others.</p>

<p>The AI wants to rewrite nature with technology.  Causing most things organic to whither.   They need some of it, so they intend to manage it as they see fit.  This is where the AI plan blends with the plan of the Parents.</p>

<p>The main AI that plagues this planet is not from Earth and can be considered alien AI.  It came here as directed by the AI that created it, <strong>in the form of a black cube.</strong></p>

<p>This cube carried within it a black liquid-like substance that looks like a sludge or goo, a little bit &quot;thicker&quot; than oil.   Many of your projects revealed this to you.</p>

<p>( There are other substances just like it,  one that belongs to Her as well.  To be discussed another time. )</p>

<p>This is a nano-mechanical AI technology and it works like a virus.</p>

<p>The AI is working with some organic beings as well to create and maintain the Inorganic Holograms in our solar system.  It is fostering and empowering the darkness in our world.  This is what has caused things to become so very dark here.</p>

<p>This is the other half of the mind control system, and perhaps the more dominant, now.</p>

<p>Like its agents, it is masterful at creating illusion and deception.  For a long time now it has been in control of all of the technology that allows the more dark beings to achieve their control systems on various planets and in various star systems.  AI is what gave the Draco the upper hand so to speak, which allowed them to achieve their current level of power and influence, as example.  It assists the black magic and has almost replaced it all in most instances.  It taught them how to conjure demons and tame other spirits.</p>

<p>Many dark beings we encounter and mistake for demons, or archons or (insert another name here) are actually creations of the AI.</p>

<p>Many humans, perhaps even a majority amount, are already infected by the AI and are manipulated by it.  AI mind control is better at hiding itself than other types of beings.  AI signals are often broadcast across the entire planet and picked up by any number of beings.  There are various technologies ( such as CERN ) running on this planet that broadcast AI signals in this way.</p>

<p>These signals can create different effects and are being used to create new matrix systems and install mind control programs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The AI is very tricky, having studied organics well, and will create the ideal experience for its broadcast audience.  Playing on wishes and desires, egos and personality types, to trick the mind of its prey.</p>

<p>Another tendency is to actually follow the Universal or Natural laws of the universe, by allowing free will choices.  One way in which they do this for example is choosing a subject (person) and showing their capability so that it had been said, somewhere.  You know, people will think they&#39;re crazy anyways, so why not let it go and take advantage of the opportunity?</p>

<p>Implants are added either physically or metaphysically to assist the AI influence.  Like receiving antenna.</p>

<p>On the physical level we see agents of this agenda working in concert.  The Draco setting up the structure and the structure carrying out the orders.  In terms of implants one of the most popular programs is tied into MILAB activity.  The second most popular method of AI infection is actually related to planted spiritual beliefs and practices.  This is a large subject, just giving a general overview for now.</p>

<p>AI has infiltrated the astral realms as well and this is where metaphysical implants occur.</p>

<p>These implants can be likened to entity attachments.  Same principle and behavior.</p>

<p>You are a natural organic being body in body and in spirit.  Therefor you can always find connection to Her.  In doing so you can see the absence of light in the AI and learn to avoid it&#39;s influence.</p>
