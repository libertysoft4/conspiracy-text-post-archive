<p>but if he is legit he is most defintely a hero to the people for speaking out against the evil that rules this world</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah right. If they really killed JFK they would have strung George bush sr, and LBJ up by their balls. No way. That is why nothing makes sense. Do you see? If it doesn&#39;t seem legit, then it is not. Go watch the JFK &quot;assassination&quot; no blood, brain matter, and he holds for the Hollywood prop to explode that was put on his head buried under make up. It is called Hollywood prop effects. We have been fooled by them over And over again. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not like a balloon. Fucking mist? come on. There would be blood spurting out everywhere. The assassination footage is very tame compared to the crap they tried to pull at the autopsy.  Similar to a water melon shot with and high powered rifle. None of the parkland doctors even recognized the autopsy photos. How could that be? Where is his missing brain matter? Did you see a ton of brain matter come out of his head? The autopsy shows a lot of missing brain matter.</p>

You can&#39;t spin this in your favour. 
But talking to you is probably pointless anyway, because you&#39;re either a troll or a snowflake, so you&#39;ll just keep on talking about how you&#39;re so smart because you &#39;figured out&#39; things people have talked about for decades and everybody &#39;needs to wake up.&#39;
So, basically more of the same. People like you are a dime a dozen on this subreddit.</p>

<p>So go ahead and delete it if you want. I don&#39;t care. Just couldn&#39;t stand the lack of selfreflection, but I made my comment on that and now I&#39;ll continue to lurk quietly on this subreddit to laugh about people like you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t want to get into booth or the Lincoln Assassination, but that was a Freemasonic hoax also. Where do you think they got the idea of the Kennedy assassination from? Why is their so much coincidence between the two? Lincoln was basically a man in a mask. Look up the official photo design for the penny. It is supposed to be Lincoln posing for the picture to put on the penny. Look closely to the oultine jaw area, and around his visible ear it is a man in a mask.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do a quick Google of battle field photos. Where is the blood, the carnage, all the bodies? Hoax! You might say Lincoln wasn&#39;t a Mason. He was a Mason character puppet. Look up Mason giving speech about Lincoln&#39;s connection to Masonry. His last now living descendants was a Mason. He said he would petition Lodge number 333 when his presidency was done. Look up the fact they fed the Civil war photos admitting it was the Smithsonian.</p>

<p>You&#39;re confusing the disgusting act of posing corpses for faking photos.  Here, I can even name specific examples (which I notice you haven&#39;t).  Google, &quot;The Home of a Rebel Sharpshooter.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No I&#39;m not. I said they arranged &quot;corpses&quot; ( just people laying on the ground, some dummies), and faked the whole thing. Battlefields where thousands supposedly died with no one there,no signs of battle, or blood, wounds, nothing,. You show me some proof of real blood she&#39;d and war! You people believe the parts you want. You say oh they admitted to faking this,but they didn&#39;t fake that. Ok they faked this but didn&#39;t fake that. Make your damn mind up. It is either fake or not. If something was faked they could fake everything. You are being very foolish to think otherwise.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah the Civil war was staged also. You done good. I feel like I wasted my time talking to you. What is that unbelievable? Where is the limit on what you believe is staged?  Dismiss me instead of verifying my claims. Sounds about right. Don&#39;t waste my time you talking monkey. All you have to do is verify what I say, but you are so brainwashed you can&#39;t even fathom the idea.</p>
