        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><h1>Murdered Putin&#39;s impersonator openly tells who he is: a traitor - 6 examples..</h1>

<p><strong>Introduction</strong><br/>
Each time you click &quot;news&quot; about &quot;NATO v Putin&quot; you are in fact being mocked by the illuminati.<br/>
Real Putin, wife and daughters were murdered 2010 and replaced with doubles: the illuminati&#39;s greatest coup in Armageddon.<br/>
The coup was executed by illuminati agents, lead by Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.<br/>
Anyone not completely brainwashed can immediately recognize the impostor from his face alone (see undeniable <a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-DdqtQ3lPO4M/U2l9RAlF6lI/AAAAAAAAAQA/wpw0lM_0jRI/s1600/real+v+fake.jpg">photo</a> evidence), not to mention his voice or more importantly his deeds.<br/>
According to the illuminati religion, fake &quot;Putin&quot; openly tells that he&#39;s an illuminati agent: 6 examples ...</p>

<p><strong>&quot;Putin&quot; as messenger - not forced, just fulfilling the &quot;in plain sight&quot; commandment of the illuminati religion:</strong><br/>
<strong>1.</strong> &quot;Putin&quot; frees &quot;oligarchs&quot;, alias the illuminati agents in the role of economic hitmen at the time angelic Putin became president, December 31, 1999 (Khodorkovsky, Berezovsky &amp; Co).<br/>
Note: Khodorkovsky a free man 2013 was introduced by the illuminati joke &quot;Putin cuts 2 months of Khodorkovsky&#39;s sentence until 2017&quot;.</p>

<p><strong>2.</strong> &quot;Putin&quot; transfers Russia&#39;s natural resources, starting with non-renewables (oil, gas) to illuminati corporations (BP &amp; Co).</p>

<p><strong>3.</strong> &quot;Putin&quot; sells nazis as partners. The more NATO deploys around Russia the more &quot;Putin&quot; and Lavrov repeat that NATO is a partner and there&#39;s nothing to be afraid of.<br/>
Reminder: the real Putin retaliated each time NATO tried to deploy closer to its borders.<br/>
Note: this is pushed to the limits with these kind of illuminati jokes:<br/>
- 2012 &quot;Putin&quot; officially becomes the main weapons supplier of illuminati puppet Assad, following the theater &quot;NATO stops arms sales to Syria&quot;.<br/>
Reminder: NATO previously gave to Assad one of the largest chemical arsenals in the world (meant to be used in the agenda &quot;destruction of Israel&quot;, in coordination with the treasonous Israeli government).<br/>
- 2014 &quot;India turns to Russia to help supply arms to Afghan forces&quot;, or in other words: India and Russia puppet governments called to replace the current 110,000 NATO mercenaries in preventing the Kabul puppet regime from collapsing.  </p>

<p><strong>4.</strong> &quot;Putin&quot; delivers Crimea&#39;s huge arsenal to the fascist Kiev regime, after the Crimea referendum.<br/>
This arsenal includes hundreds of tanks used 3 weeks later to bomb the anti-fascist guerrilla and to crush women and elderly trying to stop them with their hands.  </p>

<p><strong>&quot;Putin&quot; as messenger - forced to tell it &quot;in plain sight&quot;:</strong><br/>
<strong>5.</strong> &quot;Putin&quot; not only refuses to supply arms to the anti-fascists in East Ukraine but goes as far as to call for them to disarm, April 2014.<br/>
All this after a few brave men got control of the police station of Slavyansk, reacting to the nazi laws issued by the Kiev regime, from banning their language to closing the border with Russia to adult males.</p>

<p><strong>6.</strong> &quot;Putin&quot; and nazi-controlled media suppress calls of Russian patriots to protect anti-fascists from genocide, starting with a no-fly zone over East Ukraine.<br/>
All this after for the first time ever since Hitler&#39;s army surrendered, an UN recognized government of an European state:<br/>
- bombs its citizens, first with tanks (May 1, 2014 - Slaviansk), 3 days later also with helicopters and one day later also with airforce jets;<br/>
- burns its citizens inside buildings during pogroms (May 2, 2014 - Odessa).</p>

<p>&quot;Russia vs ISIS&quot; is a hoax, nothing more than non-stop illuminati theater while both Turkey and Russia in Syrian skies bombing the real freedom fighters.<br/>
In other words it&#39;s USA/Russia/Assad and ISIS vs real rebels.<br/>

<p>Is that why MSM and politicians were trying to justify toppling Assad for months on end? Is that why <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/isis-fighters-regret-attacking-israel-apologize-defense-minister-591020">ISIS apologized for shooting at Israelis</a>?</p>

Fake rebels were created not only for the fake war &quot;against&quot; Assad but also for the real war against the real rebels.<br/>
These professional killers range from Turkish NATO soldiers to Chechens supplied by &quot;Putin&quot;, all trained to slaughter civilians.</p>

<p>Same as &quot;US vs North Korea&quot; hoax, &quot;Assad/Iran/Russia &amp; US led coalition vs ISIS&quot; is another fake war to advance general and specific agendas.<br/>
The governments of those countries are controlled by treasonous agents and are all part of the same gang.  </p>

<p>The official &quot;alliances&quot; you mention are exposed as theater by any number of facts, such as:<br/>
- the previously mentioned NATO supplying of chemical weapons to Assad;<br/>
- to having new Toyota pickup trucks delivered to ISIS, from Syria&#39;s Raqqa to Libya&#39;s Derna (until Libyan patriots forced ISIS to escape to Sirte). Toyota knows where every pickup was produced/sold and to whom.</p>

<p>The illuminati ordered &quot;Putin&quot; to deploy anti-aerial missiles in Syria.<br/>
Supposedly as protection against Turkey/NATO, but in fact as part of the &quot;Gog / Magog&quot; script setting the stage for the destruction of Israel, fulfilling the illuminati anti-Bible.</p>
