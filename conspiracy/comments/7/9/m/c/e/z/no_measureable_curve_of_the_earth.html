That if you calculate the curve and go test it out in real life, you can see things in the horizon that you should not be able to see if there was a curve. And that bodies of water dont curve either and that some laser measurements over large canals show this. And that one can see distances on sea that one should not be able to see if there was a curve. Also the balloons that have been sent up with cameras that dont have fish eye lenses show a horizon that does not curve.</p>

Looming is a very simple explanation for what is happening.  But you can do a cool experiment yourself tonight.  Find yourself a nice body of water and head down there for sunset.  Lie on the floor with your heard on the ground and watch the sunset.  As soon as the sun disappears below the horizon, jump up to your feet and you will see it set again.  Because the Earth  has a curved surface, as backed up by:</p>

<p>Millennia of sound mathematics.</p>

<p>The fact other celestial bodies are also spheres.</p>

<p>The fact that we have time zones, seasons, day and night etc.</p>

<p>The fact that if you travel in the same direction you eventually return to your destination.</p>

<p>The numerous human and machine observations of a clearly round Earth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ouch.....my brain.  Small children get this!  Why cant you?</p>

<p>The reason there is an &#39;up&#39; or &#39;down&#39; is because of gravity.  What direction does a helium balloon go in space?  It doesn&#39;t go up or down because those terms don&#39;t apply.  Things only rise and fall in their mediums due to their density BECAUSE OF GRAVITY.  Without gravity there would be nothing to pull the objects down in the first place.</p>

<p>You&#39;ve hit on a good point though.  And that is that gravity is a very weak force.  So weak that you i can raise my eyebrows with the muscles in my head.  So weak that I can jump completely off the ground.  But not so weak that it doesn&#39;t bring me back down again.  That&#39;s the part you&#39;re forgetting about.  Gravity works because of a cumulative effect.  The larger the mass, the stronger the force.  You need a huge object to generate enough gravity to have a planet such as ours. The difference between the oceans remaining on the surface (although that&#39;s not strictly true because of evaporation and wave action) and a fly taking off is that the fly is applying a force in opposition to gravity.  The oceans are not.</p>

<p>That has not been proven. There could be an up and down just because there is an up and down. Gravity has never been found or observed. Before gravity everything was explained by density and boyancy, there was no need to have any magical forces pulling objects to each other.</p>

<p>I let Nikola Tesla speak for me:</p>

<p>Today&#39;s scientists have substituted mathematics for experiments, and they wander off through equation after equation, and eventually build a structure which has no relation to reality.</p>

<p>You are just assuming there is a force called gravity. You can say there is gravity but you cant demonstrate it, you can just claim that what already is happening is proving you, which is circular arguing.</p>

<p>Things have always fell down in this manner, if you propose there is gravity, you need to be able to show it to me, show it affecting things. With magnets you can actually show two objects are attracted and there is no question, also you can reveal the magnetic fields themselves.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;... Supposing that the bodies act upon the surrounding space causing curving of the same, it appears to my simple mind that the curved spaces must react on the bodies, and producing the opposite effects, straightening out the curves. Since action and reaction are coexistent, it follows that the supposed curvature of space is entirely impossible - But even if it existed it would not explain the motions of the bodies as observed. Only the existence of a field of force can account for the motions of the bodies as observed, and its assumption dispenses with space curvature. All literature on this subject is futile and destined to oblivion. So are all attempts to explain the workings of the universe without recognizing the existence of the ether and the indispensable function it plays in the phenomena.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We don&#39;t know everything about gravity.</p>

<p>What we do know is that there is SOME force that makes things that are more dense sink compared to things that are less dense. We know this because, as you said, dirt sinks in water. This is something we can observe and it simply would not be possible unless some type of force was causing the movement to happen.</p>

<p>This is the force that we call gravity. You can call it whatever you&#39;d like really. You could call it &quot;Banana Force&quot; but the fact remains that we&#39;d still be talking about the same thing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not a force pulling it upwards. Gravity is still pulling it downwards.</p>

<p>The difference is that helium is so much <em>less dense</em> that it does not have as much of an effect on the balloon filled with helium as it does on the dirt, the water, or even the regular atmospheric air that we breathe.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Every action has an equal and opposite reaction. By filling the balloon in with helium you have created a new space of lower density. It has the property of being lighter than the surrounding air.</p>

<p>The surrounding air gets pulled &#39;underneath&#39; the balloon because the air is heavier. Since the balloon is filled with an area of lower density it floats on top of all the air that is being pulled down around it.</p>

<p>A cell phone isnt a satellite phone... You can get hybrids but they are pricey. Most consumer cells phones run off of cell towers, the call clarity is better and more reliable. Satellite phones are for very remote areas or for devices that need reliable signal. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are no real pictures of satelites in space. </p>

<p>There definitely are satellites. This one is easy to debunk. Many people and businesses rely on satellites, I can tell you for a fact that the company I work for rents time on one and the data it provides is only possible from a very high up orbit and its moving very fast. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Even satellites with closer vantage points and higher resolutions are out of luck. NASA&#39;s Terra and Aqua satellites carry the MODIS (or Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) instrument and operate only about 440 miles above the Earth’s surface.</p>

<p><strong>“With the MODIS satellite, which has a resolution of one kilometer, you’d probably barely be able to make out something like the ISS,&quot; says Herman. &quot;If it did pass through the field of view, you might see a bright spot, but you wouldn’t see many details, so it would be really hard to identify.”</strong> And that’s only if the ISS and Terra or Aqua happened to be in the same area.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Space is big and satellites are small. Also since we all know they exist why would someone send up a satellite worth tens of millions just to get pictures of other satellites? It would be a waste of money to do so, just to prove a point that doesnt need proving. There is more than enough info that satellites exist. </p>

<p>Not possible. Those balloons would have to be moving insanely fast, like impossibly fast to be possible. </p>

<p>So no, I do not think satellites are balloons. </p>

<p>No, I thought I was fairly clear... The speeds involved are too high for balloons or really anything in the atmosphere. </p>

<p>The balloons would also be at the mercy of the winds so they wouldnt have the exact same predictable paths as we expect with a satellite. For example the company I work for rents time on a satellite and they have windows to take measurements with, requiring multiple passes of the same satellite. You can literally see it pass over the site, measure move past the site and we wait until it makes another pass from the opposite side and take more measurements. Repeat until measuring is done. </p>

<p>There is no feasible way for a balloon to replicate what that satellite does. Zero, never, no way. </p>

<p>I ask this because I trust that what you are saying would make sense, therefore, I&#39;m curious what the purpose of balloon-launched satellites would be, as there seems to be solid claims that they exist. Why would they do that if the paths weren&#39;t predictable and if satellites in space could do it better? Thoughts?</p>

<p>From my understanding the balloon is just to cut out a bulk of the flight. Those satellites still launch themselves from the balloon using a traditional rocket to get into orbit. There is no way for a balloon to deliver a payload that remains in orbit, its not possible. </p>

<p>You&#39;re speaking as if you have knowledge that that is how it happens. There isn&#39;t evidence of that. How did you come to that understanding, if I may ask?</p>

<p>The satellites that are currently tethered to balloons are not rocketed into space, they just stay attached to the balloons. They also don&#39;t require great speeds to collect or transmit data, there just needs to be a network of them, as you probably understand from your experience. </p>

<p>It turns out that NWS and international weather agencies launches 2 balloons every day from over 900 locations worldwide. If they can do it, so can government agencies with deeper pockets. </p>

<p>Alright, buckle in buddy. You clearly are not aware with a lot of things that you seem to throw around your opinion about, willy-nilly.</p>

<p>You&#39;re not familiar with how data-collecting instruments can and are employed around the world on high-altitude balloons, and are offering me nothing but your opinion on it without looking into it first.

<p>It&#39;s not a conspiracy just because you aren&#39;t familiar with it, and not being in the know does not equal zero evidence. It doesn&#39;t require that I prove it to you. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.nasa.gov/centers/langley/about/project-echo.html">https://www.nasa.gov/centers/langley/about/project-echo.html</a></p>

<p>They used it to communicate over distances that wouldn&#39;t otherwise be possible, by sending data from a ground station and bouncing it off the balloon.  </p>

<p>&quot;A 26 meter antenna (later named Echo) was built in Goldstone, California several miles from the Pioneer antenna to transmit voice communication. The Echo antenna included a transmitter operating at S-band (2.39 GHz), which was very sophisticated for the time. Another antenna was built in Holmdel, New Jersey to receive transmissions. Once the balloon was launched into orbit, a prerecorded message from President Dwight Eisenhower was transmitted from California and heard with clarity in New Jersey.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That seems reasonable, yet almost beyond my understanding (I&#39;ve studied a little bit of wave theory and radio propagation theory in my past vocation, but only paid enough attention to get the job done). I would seem to imply that there was technology to do that, wouldn&#39;t it? I don&#39;t know, I&#39;m genuinely asking. </p>

<p>I did read that it was a passive system, which doesn&#39;t seem to support having transmitters, by definition. I am not doubting that you have seen somewhere that it does, but the NASA page at least seems to contradict that, not that I haven&#39;t seen them contradict themselves before. To be sure, I do appreciate your insight and perspective, thank you. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I misread the beacon transmitters as comms ones.   More info:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Echo 1A spacecraft was a 30.48 m diameter balloon of mylar polyester film 0.0127 mm thick. The spacecraft was designed as a passive communications reflector for transcontinental and intercontinental telephone (voice), radio, and television signals. It had 107.9 MHz beacon transmitters for telemetry purposes. These transmitters were powered by five nickel-cadmium batteries that were charged by 70 solar cells mounted on the balloon. </p>

<p>Indeed. Also, the ability to bounce radio-telephone, much less television signals off of it, intercontinentally, without a booster or repeater, is, well, also interesting. I can&#39;t get a cell signal in my bathroom, for buddha&#39;s sake (not true, but it makes for a poor attempt at comic relief, at least).</p>

I&#39;ve liked into it because I have studied Geography and I have studied Physics and I understand and have tested these simple concepts.  It&#39;s bad science of the flat-earther&#39;s part because they have decided that only their own personal observations count. It doesn&#39;t matter if some incredibly intelligent and skilled pilot has flown to the edge of space and has personally seen the curvature of the Earth. It doesn&#39;t matter that brilliant engineers and computer programmers and physicists have developed satellites which have pushed human technology forward. You haven&#39;t done it or seen it for yourself and because of that, you are willing to accept all sorts of mumbo-jumbo. </p>

<p>Just think. If the Earth was flat then I should be able to have a strong telescope set up on Mt. Kilimanjaro and see the Statue of Liberty. If the Earth was flat then I would be able to see the Southern Cross from anywhere in the world. </p>

<p>But you say it is flat. Now,  your &#39;evidence&#39; is based on a misunderstanding of the nature of perspective and the effect of topography on sight distances. BUT let&#39;s say we disregard that. Let&#39;s say that it doesn&#39;t add up and you might be onto something. So far you haven&#39;t shown that the Earth is flat.

<p>Not true because the air is a medium through which you cant see into infinity. You can only see so far through it. When the air is more humid and there is fog in the air the human eye cant see very far. The same kind of thing happens over longer distances.</p>

<p>There are clear instances of them faking stuff. Such as wires being shown, gravity suddendly dissapearing (how is that possible if you are in space?), bubbles coming from the astronauts as if they were under water. Suprisingly they do have a space station replicant under water that they use to &quot;train&quot;. </p>

<p>Oh, dear lord, no. That&#39;s actually a question that science is attempting to solve, but with more cart in front of the horse answers. &quot;If this is so, then this <em>must</em> be the reason for it&quot;. Statements like that are purely philosophical assumptions and not based on empirical studies.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not trying to argue the nature of reflectors, I was responding to the the question of &quot;How did the reflectors get there?&quot;, and how it was an unnecessary and unproductive question. </p>

<p>For example, regardless of anyone&#39;s position of whether we landed on the moon or not, to ask a person who doesn&#39;t believe it, &quot;How did we get the LEM onto the moon?&quot;, would be non-productive, as there is already an assumption that there can&#39;t be one on the moon, much less to answer how it got there, as proof that we landed on the moon.

<p>We know because of man made objects on the moon the approximate distance to those mirrors. </p>

<p>That&#39;s a good start, and googling it does help, so well done in looking into it. </p>

<p>I will say that you&#39;ve based some of your opinion that you&#39;ve shared in our exchange on things you knew nothing about until this conversation, and it&#39;s good to continue looking deeper, if you choose to. I&#39;m not here trying to prove anything to you, and respect that you believe what you do. I came from the same place, and to question others&#39; ability to discern things also would be an unfortunate assumption, until they prove it to be true. There&#39;s a big internet out there, and of course a lot of it is there to make us dumber, so yay for those going into it with that concern in mind, a perspective which I&#39;m sure we both share.</p>

<p>Happy hunting and be nice to those seeking answers, please. Or don&#39;t, I&#39;m not in charge of what anyone else does or thinks.</p>

<p>I think many reading this, including me, would disagree with your summary of &quot;my articles&quot;, nor am I saying that I believe one thing or another. </p>

<p>I am, however, making the claim that moon rocks are not a reliable proof that we&#39;ve been to the moon, because the evidence of it shows that the rocks, handled by agents and agencies of the government (NASA, Nixon, Astronauts), were found, in hundreds of occasions, to be untrustworthy as bonafide evidence, and, also puts into question such agencies&#39; inability to account for them.</p>

<p>he first experiment at this site was conducted by Rowbotham in the summer of 1838. He waded into the river and used a telescope held eight inches (20 cm) above the water to watch a boat, with a flag on its mast three feet (0.91 m) above the water, row slowly away from him.[3] He reported that the vessel remained constantly in his view for the full six miles (9.7 km) to Welney bridge, whereas, had the water surface been curved with the accepted circumference of a spherical earth, the top of the mast should have been some 11 feet (3.4 m) below his line of sight. He published this observation using the pseudonym Parallax in 1849 and subsequently expanded it into a book, Earth Not a Globe, published in 1865.[4] </p>

<p>One simple way of testing this is to watch a ship go over the horizon, sailing away from you. </p>

<p>It will disappear bottom first. Now if you increase your elevation even a little the boat comes back into view. This is unexplained on a FE. Elevation should have nothing to do with how far you can see. </p>

<p>You are claiming that when one is seeing ships dissapear with their bare eyes that they are going below the curve. This is not correct, if one takes binoculars and looks the ship will come back into view. If the ship was behind a horizon and you look with binoculars without rising your elavation the ship should not come back into view... but it does. This is clear proof that what you are seeing is not a ship going behind a curve.</p>

<p>It would work. Perspective works in such a way that if for example you are looking at a long hall the floor goes up and the ceiling comes down and they meet in the middle and this line in which they meet is called horizon line. When you rise up you see more of the land (or water in your case) before it meets the sky in the horizon point. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>It brings objects into view that were invisible to the eye. You were saying earlier that when a ship goes invisible for your eye it goes beyond the curve. It doesnt.</p>

<p>You cant see cuba from florida because air is not clear, it distorts light. In a fog you cant see even that far.</p>

<p>Lets say the boat is shaped like a cube for kicks and giggles. </p>

<p>The surface area of the boat doesnt change but it still will reappear in your vision if you increase your horizon. This is also replicable with a digital camera or telescope, increasing elevation increases the amount those items can see. </p>

<p>I would argue those objects are still visible just too small to see without assistance. They would be invisible totally if completely over the horizon.

</blockquote>

<p>The vanishing point of your perspective makes things vanish before they would even go beyond the supposed curve. So what hides things is your perspective. </p>

<p>If you were standing on a ball, you would never see the horizon at your eye level because no matter in what direction you look, all sides of the ball are bending down and away from you. Yet even if we climb to high altitudes the horizon stays on eye level. This is not possible on a ball because the horizon would not even be on eye level when you were on the ground, and it would sink down even further the more elavated you become.</p>

<p>There isnt. There is some guy that put up some sticks ages ago up and after that people just believe in it. There is math but people havent actually done these things in real life.

<p>It should be nowhere near your eyelevel. You should be looking down. A lot. If you rise up 10 meters the horizon should go down at least ten meters. It can not go down less than ten meters because also the higher you go over a ball the farther you see and the farther you see the more the ball bends down and the lower the horizon is. If you think the amounts we are speaking of are something that need to be measured by a theodolity you are not understanding what it means to rise up on a ball.</p>

<p>You dont need calculations, use common sense. Imagine you are standing over a ball. The whole surface of the ball is under you.

<p>That&#39;s strange. Perspective is very important in architectural drawings.
So you say you never heard of this &quot;perspective&quot; you don&#39;t even want to name in your own comment, while you boast about being an expert on the subject? <em>phony</em></p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perspective_%28graphical%29">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perspective_%28graphical%29</a>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architectural_drawing#Architectural_perspective">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architectural_drawing#Architectural_perspective</a></p>

<p>&quot;Perspective in drawing is an approximate representation on a flat surface of an image as it is perceived by the eye. The key concepts here are:</p>

<p>Perspective is the view from a particular fixed viewpoint.
Horizontal and vertical edges in the object are represented by horizontals and verticals in the drawing.
Lines leading away into the distance appear to converge at a vanishing point.
All horizontals converge to a point on the horizon, which is a horizontal line at eye level.
Verticals converge to a point either above or below the horizon.&quot;</p>

<p>&#39;&#39;In art, especially painting, aerial perspective refers to the technique of creating an illusion of depth by depicting distant objects as paler, less detailed, and usually bluer than near objects.</p>

<p>(One caution: in common speech, the words perspective and viewpoint tend to be used interchangeably; however, in art, aerial perspective does not imply an aerial viewpoint.&#39;&#39;</p>

<p>&#39;&#39;The two most characteristic features of perspective are that objects are smaller as their distance from the observer increases; and that they are subject to foreshortening, meaning that an object&#39;s dimensions along the line of sight are shorter than its dimensions across the line of sight.&#39;&#39;</p>

<p>It is measurable, but you also have to acknowledge refraction is a thing. We know it exists and we know it can affect light. </p>

<p>No ad hominem in my statement was intended, I was truly offering a moment for pause, as I had to ask myself the same question once.</p>

<p>So, from your educated position, what formula(s) do you use to measure? This will help others gain the discernment that you have and will allow them to look at it from a scientific approach (thanks in advance). </p>

<p>And, I do acknowledge that refraction is a thing, we are in agreement there. </p>

<p>The formulas are on wikipedia. Really easy to look up, the math is above me though. </p>

<p>What measurements have you done and how do they differ from the expected result? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I appreciate the question. </p>

<p>I was told all of my life to accept scientific expertise on all matters, especially of the cosmos. I was told this by being ridiculed for asking innocent questions, out of my own ignorance. It turns out that I was aware enough to see deception in the answers, at least. </p>

<p>As you are here on a conspiracy sub, you also surely question things. At some point, I&#39;m sure we would agree that there is deception happening at institutional levels, whether it be media institutions, scientific, educational, financial, political. </p>

<p>The punchline is, whatever &quot;conspiracies&quot; you have followed and &quot;believe&quot; in, whatever scientific facts you&#39;ve learned through your life, I also have, and likely share a lot of that knowledge with you. I&#39;ve just stopped accepting a lot of the contradictions, assumptions, and rationalizations and started looking into it myself. </p>

<p>I could spend hours with you sharing my story, and would love to, if you were truly interested. There is no one discrepancy in the current system, there is a multitude. The notion that we can use curvature to defend a globe earth is one of them, we can&#39;t. The only way to prove it is to show it from space. There are a lot of discrepancies for what we are being showed from space. </p>

<p>The current &quot;system&quot; in which there are discrepancies, isn&#39;t just referring to orbital mechanics, astrophysics, and earth science, it refers to the system of control that is inferred by almost every post on this subreddit. </p>

<p>When people on this sub ask, &quot;What&#39;s the conspiracy?&quot;, the answer is usually one and the same: OP infers that there are unspoken systems of control that deceive the public (which I tend to accept as true). Try it on for yourself, look at any r/conspiracy post, and see if that answer could be inferred.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, regarding your question to me, the information is out there, yes there is plenty of bad information, but an intelligent mind, as yours surely is, will be able to find good info, if you are truly curious. You surely do that for other conspiracies, I&#39;m assuming, as, you are investing time on a conspiracy sub. </p>

<p>What is one discrepancy with gravity that you have noticed? </p>

<blockquote>

<p>We could have that debate but Im more interested in these discrepancies. Just toss a few out. </p>

<p>The question about censorship and control on websites like this is independent of hard facts about our world. </p>

<p>It would be like saying there is a system in place that forces people to believe 2+2=5, you can say that but at the end of the say we can prove that 2+2=4 regardless of what an authority says. </p>

<p>I agree with you and that is what Flat Earth researchers strive to do, as every argument about the globe and space came from an authority claiming 2+2=5, in their opinion, which, again, must acknowledge the larger system at play, as, if the larger system can control what the masses think and know about everything, history included, then we could all have been born into a world of deception and not have known it.</p>

<p>My concern with gravity starts with learning about gravity and not just believing it. Newtonian gravity, which is what we all celebrate, was disproven and replaced by Einstein&#39;s theory of gravity. Many would hold the opinion that Einstein didn&#39;t disprove it, he just improved it. It is an acknowledgement that everything up to the point of Einstein, regarding gravity, didn&#39;t work as postulated by Newton. </p>

<p>So, the argument then is that for hundreds of years, a view of gravity that was not functional was good enough to celebrate and say that newton proved gravity. It reminds me of a joke regarding someone who claimed that they were as smart as DaVinci, because he <em>also</em> created plans for a helicopter that did not and could not fly.</p>

<p>&quot;Proofs&quot; of gravity seems to put the cart before the horse. For example, before the supposed discovery of gravitational waves this year, at one time in the past, they didn&#39;t have an answer to <em>96%</em> of what should be out there IF gravity existed. So they had to name that 96% dark matter and dark energy. They did not &quot;discover&quot; these elements of nature, they had to name a thing couldn&#39;t explain the failure of gravity&#39;s &quot;math&quot;. </p>

<p>False. You can prove a globe Earth without NASA or the government. Im not sure what led you to believe all data comes from NASA. </p>

<p>Im sorry but this doesnt actually seem to address the argument at hand. If anything you just praised the scientific process for doing what its supposed to do. </p>

<p>As for proofs putting the cart before the horse, Ill have to disagree. </p>

<p>We know exaclty how objects interact with each other under gravity. Can you offer an alternative that can model our universe even remotely close to what we observe? </p>

<p>If it means anything to you I also think that the FE movement is bad for humanity as a whole. It reinforces anti-intellectualism and teaches people to abandon the scientific method i n lieu of their feels. You literally have to ignore entire sciences and arguments to make a FE work. I could go on and on about the issues with FE but since you would rather sling mud and make up bunk positions with no support Im out. </p>

<p>One often hears flat earthers say that there is no curve.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No curve on the horizon, but the ground is curved toward the horizon.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That if you calculate the curve and go test it out in real life, you can see things in the horizon that you should not be able to see if there was a curve.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Seems like some real easy science to cite. Links?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And that bodies of water dont curve either and that some laser measurements over large canals show this.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bodies of water, minus wind and gravity waves, are level with the center of gravity of Earth. Earth is an oblate spheroid, so the top of large bodies of water will be tangent to the center of gravity. That means curved.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And that bodies of water dont curve either and that some laser measurements over large canals show this.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, seems like some easy science to point to. Links? Large bodies of water curve with the tangent to Earth&#39;s center of gravity. This is easily demonstrated by standing on the beach in Key West, looking south, and NOT seeing Cuba, just 90 miles away. Meanwhile, you can stand 100 miles from Mt. Rainier in Washington and see its top. So there is no &quot;perspective&quot; or &quot;atmospheric&quot; limitation. The limitation is that water is in the way because you have to look down to see Cuba.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And that one can see distances on sea that one should not be able to see if there was a curve.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>More uncited claims.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also the balloons that have been sent up with cameras that dont have fish eye lenses show a horizon that does not curve.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The horizon will not be curved. The horizon is a 2-d shape. A circle. You are at the center of that circle. It will not curve, it will be flat. The ground, however, will be curving away from you to the horizon.</p>

<p>Again. And this cannot be stressed enough. THE HORIZON IS FLAT. IT IS A CIRCLE. It isn&#39;t going to bend away from you, it&#39;s going to be flat, because it&#39;s a circle and you are at the center of the circle.</p>

<p>What do you think?</p>

<p>There isnt. There is some guy that put up some sticks ages ago up and after that people just believe in it. There is math but people havent actually done these things in real life. Like went in some place and looked how far they see from that place and then calculate the curve and see how far they should have seen and if these two things match. The people that have done this report that they see farther than they should.</p>

<p>Search on youtube for perspective on flat earth.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Follow my logic here. What is the vanishing point?</p>

<p>The Vanishing point is the horizon. Where the earth and the sky come together and meet as the horizon line.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Thats not true. People have shown its not true with a theodolite. A device that tests exactly that...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It should be nowhere near your eyelevel. You should be looking down. A lot. If you rise up 10 meters the horizon should go down at least ten meters. It can not go down less than ten meters because also the higher you go over a ball the farther you see and the farther you see the more the ball bends down and the lower the horizon is. If you think the amounts we are speaking of are something that need to be measured by a theodolity you are not understanding what it means to rise up on a ball.</p>

<p>That&#39;s strange. Perspective is very important in architectural drawings.
So you say you never heard of this &quot;perspective&quot; you don&#39;t even want to name in your own comment, while you boast about being an expert on the subject? <em>phony</em></p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perspective_%28graphical%29">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perspective_%28graphical%29</a>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architectural_drawing#Architectural_perspective">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architectural_drawing#Architectural_perspective</a></p>

<p>&quot;Perspective in drawing is an approximate representation on a flat surface of an image as it is perceived by the eye. The key concepts here are:</p>

<p>Perspective is the view from a particular fixed viewpoint.
Horizontal and vertical edges in the object are represented by horizontals and verticals in the drawing.
Lines leading away into the distance appear to converge at a vanishing point.
All horizontals converge to a point on the horizon, which is a horizontal line at eye level.
Verticals converge to a point either above or below the horizon.&quot;</p>

<p>&#39;&#39;In art, especially painting, aerial perspective refers to the technique of creating an illusion of depth by depicting distant objects as paler, less detailed, and usually bluer than near objects.</p>

<p>(One caution: in common speech, the words perspective and viewpoint tend to be used interchangeably; however, in art, aerial perspective does not imply an aerial viewpoint.&#39;&#39;</p>

<p>&#39;&#39;The two most characteristic features of perspective are that objects are smaller as their distance from the observer increases; and that they are subject to foreshortening, meaning that an object&#39;s dimensions along the line of sight are shorter than its dimensions across the line of sight.&#39;&#39;</p>

<p>Even in space the moon stays in an orbit, it doesn&#39;t get closer and closer until it collides with the earth, which it should since they are both attracting each other.</p>

<p>The &quot;keeps missing the ground&quot; explanation of orbiting is amusing, gravitational force acts on something but it doesn&#39;t get any faster or closer.  </p>
