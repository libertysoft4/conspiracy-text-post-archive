    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>“There’s a suspicion that [MGM is] trying to shape [Jesus Campos&#39;] testimony and don’t want him to provide information to the public about the incident,” said Las Vegas attorney Will Kemp, who rose to national prominence while suing the MGM Grand after its deadly fire in 1980. “Obviously, they want him to come out with a version of the timeline that’s favorable to them.”</p>

<p>Another veteran trial lawyer, Robert Eglet, said the company’s decision to shelter Campos from the public could backfire.</p>

<p>“Potentially, if they are influencing him in any way on his testimony, it’s reasonable for people to suspect that they could be engaging and trying to control what his testimony or what his statement would be,” he said.</p>

<p>Eglet’s firm, which has won multimillion-dollar jury verdicts against large corporations, surveyed the crime scene and took aerial photographs, and it has a team of investigators dissecting the shooting. Several victims and their relatives have retained Eglet for possible lawsuits against MGM Resorts, he said.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr/>

<blockquote>
<p>Campos is uniquely positioned to answer questions about the hotel’s response to the shootings and discrepancies about how long it took police to breach the shooter’s hotel room door.</p>

<p>“If they’re putting him up at one of their resorts, then somebody has some explaining to do,” veteran Las Vegas lawyer Rob Murdock said. “My concern is that they may be trying to have an improper influence with a witness.”</p>

<p>But Murdock, who handled lawsuits tied to the 2007 hepatitis C outbreak in Las Vegas, said it also is possible that MGM has an “innocent” motivation to take care of one of its employees.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr/>

<blockquote>
<p>Southern California lawyers Richard Bridgford and Patrick McNicholas — who are part of a team of lawyers suing MGM on behalf of victims — said their group will be aggressively pursuing information about Campos for the civil cases.</p>

<p>“Campos is a material witness in an ongoing investigation,” Bridgford said. “We will certainly want to know the details of where he stayed, why he disappeared, who paid for his stay and, most importantly, what if anything he was told and by whom. It goes to the credibility of the witness, his bias and the ever-changing timeline we are being provided.”</p>

<p>McNicholas described the lodging arrangement between MGM and Campos as “very disconcerting” and said the security officer will be the focus of “intense scrutiny” as the lawsuits proceed through the court system. </p>

<p>Can you clarify the discrepancy you&#39;re referring to here? IIRC, the story was always that Campos checked into a quick care clinic on Thursday, October 12. I haven&#39;t seen anything that says otherwise. </p>

<p>Also I tried watching the video you linked to, but two and a half minutes in all I was seeing was ads, so I gave up. </p>

<p>&quot;His bravery was amazing because he remained with our officers, providing them the key pass to access the door and continued to help them clear rooms until our officers demanded he seek medical attention,&quot; said [Sheriff Joe] Lombardo.</p>

<p>Jesus Campos was identified as the security guard at the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino, said David Hickey, president of the union that represents the hotel&#39;s security guards. He was uncertain whether Campos was armed at the time.</p>

<p>Campos is out of the hospital, but is expected to have surgery at a later date to remove a bullet, Hickey told CNN&#39;s Wolf Blitzer.</p>

<p>&quot;His bravery was amazing because he remained with our officers, providing them the key pass to access the door and continued to help them clear rooms until our officers demanded he seek medical attention,&quot; said [Sheriff Joe] Lombardo.</p>
