        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This will be a tad lengthy but it may just be the most important post you&#39;ve ever read</p>

<p>You feel it in the air, change, it started during the 2016 election, Wikileaks released thousands of government files and emails, one of the biggest developments in recent history allowing us all to peer inside the private communications of high-level government personnel.</p>

<p>What was seen was both troubling and confusing, Spirit Cooking hit the mainstream</p>

<p><a href="https://wearechange.org/spirit-cooking-disturbing-podesta-email-yet-warning-graphic-content/">https://wearechange.org/spirit-cooking-disturbing-podesta-email-yet-warning-graphic-content/</a></p>

<p>The leaks not only reached every corner of the internet they reached the normies. This is unprecedented, allegations began to arise that there may be a secret society operating in DC comprised of Pedophiles other evidence such as the mysterious James Alefantis, GQs 25th most powerful person in DC, Pizza Shop owner with the Greek God of Pedophilia as his Instagram Profile Pic and posting very unsettling pictures of small children along with having a following of people with names such as &quot;pizzafuckingparty&quot; who post occultic content.</p>

<p><a href="https://steemit.com/pizzagate/@rebelskum/james-alefantis-once-public-instagram-jimmycomet-now-preserved-on-steemit-blockchain">https://steemit.com/pizzagate/@rebelskum/james-alefantis-once-public-instagram-jimmycomet-now-preserved-on-steemit-blockchain</a></p>

<p>MSM was quick to &quot;debunk&quot; it and disallow discussion of it on Reddit, it is impossible to say with certainty whether this Secret Society exists but the knee-jerk reaction of the media was very telling even more so now that we see people like Matt Lauer and Harvey Weinstein going down for sex assualt and even sex trafficking</p>

<p><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2017/11/30/matt-lauer-releases-statement-after-firing-there-no-words-express-my-sorrow/908287001/">https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2017/11/30/matt-lauer-releases-statement-after-firing-there-no-words-express-my-sorrow/908287001/</a></p>

<p>Pizzagate struck a chord with a lot of us plebians and struck fear into many powerful people thats all there is to it.</p>

<p>But this isn&#39;t the end of it... the story never ends just endlessly wanders along a winding path.
Now on to the point of this post, I believe this secret society exists and I believe they are about to play their final card. Through a long-term sleeper agent of theirs.</p>

<p><strong>Tom Delonge</strong></p>

<p>His first splash on most conspiracy theorists radar was being selected as &quot;UFO researcher of the year&quot;</p>

<p>(<a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/rock/7709072/tom-delonge-blink-182-ufo-researcher-award">https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/rock/7709072/tom-delonge-blink-182-ufo-researcher-award</a>)</p>

<p>His second was in the Podesta Wikileaks dump which ignited the Pizzagate investigation</p>

<p>(<a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/?q=delonge&amp;amp;sort=6">https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/?q=delonge&amp;amp;sort=6</a>)</p>

<p>He is a devout Freemason with a band utilizing masonic imagery and themes ( Angels and Airwaves ).</p>

<p><a href="https://imgur.com/a/n405E">https://imgur.com/a/n405E</a></p>

<p>He owns a company named &quot;Our Two Dogs inc&quot;</p>

<p>(<a href="https://www.manta.com/c/mhxxd5t/our-two-dogs-inc">https://www.manta.com/c/mhxxd5t/our-two-dogs-inc</a>)</p>

<p>apparently, a &quot;hot dog stand&quot; that has been around for 9 years yet has no official location or reviews or 
information about it at all online ( very pizzagate esque ) and this company is mentioned in the To The Stars Academy offering curricular as being loaned $400,000</p>

<p>( <a href="https://to-the-stars-web-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/downloads/TTSA_Offering_Circular_092917_vLAUNCH_DAY.pdf">https://to-the-stars-web-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/downloads/TTSA_Offering_Circular_092917_vLAUNCH_DAY.pdf</a> )</p>

<p>All this combined with this recent Facebook post by Tom claiming disclosure of advanced technology and alien contact is literally coming within days ( has since been deleted but multiple other posts still up claiming Mainstream release occurring next week)</p>

<p><a href="https://imgur.com/a/O9JrM">https://imgur.com/a/O9JrM</a></p>

<p>I have posted in support of his disclosure initiative but can no longer in good conscience ignore the inconsistencies.</p>

<p>He is not a scam artist he is an agent of the deep state related to Pizzagate possibly MKultra&#39;d from youth and Blink 182 was a psy-op to degrade youth or something, if not that then he has been corrupted since then and he has been chosen to be the agent of disclosure of advanced technology, aliens, and even other dimensions.</p>

<p>Key Quotes from Company representatives</p>

<p>Luis Elizondo - Reported on UFOs directly to the SecDef - Resigned oct - 2017</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I ran a sensitive aerospace threat identification program focusing on unidentified aerial technologies. It was in this position I learned that the phenomena is indeed real. And now as a member of To the Stars Academy we will bring our observations to you. For starters To the Stars Academy is planning exciting new tools and capabilities that allow you and others to effectively take part of what we’re doing and we will allow you to detect analyze categorize and yes even engineer technologies that have remained elusive until now. One of the many ways we seek to accomplish this is through a community of interests, a virtual environment of sorts. This virtual environment provides a platform for the detection and triangulation of phenomena events in real time and allows two way communication between the public and our team regarding this information. My job will be to work as a liaison and an interlocutor in the collection of this information for the science division allowing us to collect facts for analysis. We are also planning to provide never before released footage from real U.S. government systems, not blurry amateur photos but real data and real videos. And we’re inviting our government colleagues and friends and defense to participate regularly with their own findings.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Steve Justice - Lockheed Martin Skunk Works - Director of Advanced Programs</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We need to evolve those analyses and realize those technologies for the future. So an example what we may be able to do, the application of this, today is a generation of people that are not buying cars. They’re using On-Demand point to point transportation within cities. Why have a car. Imagine if that was international. You could go anywhere on the face of the earth in a matter of minutes and, just, so now you’ve removed that parameter of distance in time that separates us from friends on the other side of the Earth.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Chris Mellon ( Ever heard of this college? <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/">https://www.cmu.edu/</a> )</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There is nothing to prove here. These are just facts that need to be properly evaluated. Without the facts, neither Congress nor our democracy can function effectively. Once the truth is known some anxieties will certainly be raised but imaginations will also be fired a renewed interest in space and science will inevitably result in our government and society will respond. But we can only rise to the challenge once the public becomes aware a problem exists. Casting our eyes skyward again to the stars is a constructive and unifying proposition for mankind at a time of growing disarray.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here is Hal Puthoff, Stanford PHD Physicist and inventor having his work posted by Tom claiming the realistic possibility of a warp-drive that could go &quot;200x the speed of Light&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Ba4yFZSghID/?hl=en&amp;amp;taken-by=tomdelonge">https://www.instagram.com/p/Ba4yFZSghID/?hl=en&amp;amp;taken-by=tomdelonge</a></p>

<p>But this isn&#39;t even the fucking end of it Tom Delonge claims all his books are going to display truth wrapped in fiction to make it easier for the youth to digest and comprehend as they would never watch the lengthy boring documentaries or read the science papers involved.</p>

<p>Look at this amazing infographic relating to how his current literary works connect</p>

<p><a href="https://imgur.com/a/3d8BM">https://imgur.com/a/3d8BM</a></p>

<p>I also have a summary of my own of the meaning I have pulled from this</p>

<p>Demons and other dimensions are real, media has depicted truth wrapped in fiction, for many years. Examples depicting the reality of the situation appear in media such as but not limited to:</p>

<p>1.Insidious - The Further is a realm accessible in sleep or meditation that is full of evil beings that want to steal your soul and take over your body</p>

<p>2.Nightmare on Elm Street - Freddy is an evil being that committed atrocities on earth and now lurks the &quot;Dream realm&quot; looking for prey but can only harm them once they enter the dream realm he inhabits</p>

<p>3.Stranger Things - Government trains a child from birth to be able to enter the &quot;upsidedown&quot; a dimension layered over our own but dark and spooky, her goal is to gather intelligence/secrets for the CIA, evil beings lurk this realm ready to consume you and have the ability to escape into the real world, this is literally based off a real government project
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montauk_Project">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montauk_Project</a></p>

<p>4.Poet Anderson - This story revolves around a lucid dreamer who enters a &quot;shared consciousness dreamscape&quot; inhabited by evil beings that want to eat his soul and take over his body and he can move about this realm and others at will.</p>

<p>5.Religion - Nearly every major religion speaks of a hellish dimension you can end up in one way or another</p>

<p>6.CIA Document on Gateway - the CIA released a document(linked below)vetting the reliability of training agents to have physic powers the document is nearly 30 pages and acquired from CIA.gov the most stand out quote comes in the conclusion</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Be intellectually prepared to encounter non -corporeal energy beings when time-space boundaries are exceeded</p>
</blockquote>

<p>CIA Doc - <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP96-00788R001700210016-5.pdf">https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP96-00788R001700210016-5.pdf</a></p>

<p>I knew about 1 - 7 for years now but it took an outside perspective and one final piece for me to understand the bigger picture</p>

<p>8.Kyle Odom: Kyle was a 12 year US marine, after which he maintained a 3.96 GPA and acquired his Master&#39;s Degree while acquiring his Ph.D. in human genetics he began to as he puts it &quot; experiment with meditation and extreme states of consciousness&quot; he describes entering another dimension where he is separated from his physical form. In this dimension, he encounters a being which he claims he immediately gave into which then merged with his mind and gave him the most intense feelings of ecstasy ever experienced, after this encounter he was never able to Astral Project again and he descends into paranoid schizophrenia, either he actually was stalked and surrounded by evil beings from other dimensions or the original being he encountered was a mind parasite which drove him insane (leading to him shooting up a church) Other notable information relating to Odom includes claims that they were trying to force him to be the next school shooter and that most of those terrible events are perpetrated by these other dimensional beings, furthermore the shooting that he is notorious for he claims the man he shot Pastor Tim Remington was a shapeshifting alien, crazy right? well, the pastor survived 6 - 12 gunshot wounds at least 2 in the head from a .45 and I should also mention Odom won ribbons for his marksmanship skills.</p>

<p>Odom manifesto - <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2754139-Kyle-Odom-Manifesto.html">https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2754139-Kyle-Odom-Manifesto.html</a></p>

<p>We are living in a world where each and every one of us has the power to enter other dimensions at will with the proper training, in these dimensions lurk evil beings which are capable of trapping us in their dimension and taking over our physical bodies.</p>

<p>I believe this is the mystery religion the Illuminati subscribes to and I believe within 10 days the world will be forever transformed I hope you all will be willing to help me flesh this out further and uncover things i have not considered</p>

<p>EDIT:
Ancilliary information corroborating disclosure / first contact / blue beam</p>

<p>I have been following these guys on twitter for awhile and they have made some pretty grand and insightful claims I am not a gullible person and am well versed in many of the things they discuss and they operate with shocking  coherence not typical of a larper not to mention over 6 months of continous in correct corroboration and continuation of the story line of the galactic federation slowly liberating earth and preparing for first contact in november - december </p>

<p>Twitter.com/kibbitzlaw</p>

<p>Twitter.com/Kabamur_Taygeta</p>

<p>They have been posting thousands of breadcrumbs of information since like February and the whole time they were discussing a Alien Contact occurring in November, and giving supposed updates on a war occuring between basically good aliens and bad aliens &quot;Pleiadians&quot; and &quot;The Cabal&quot; they claim this planet has been held hostage with advanced doomsday weapons and have in recent days claimed that all those measures were dismantaled and they are on the cusp of Victory</p>

<p>Most recent tweet from claimed Pleiadians</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Light Trumps Darkness Who is POTUS? 
Why is this relevant? 
Are You ready for Truth? 
There is always a choice 
The Dawn of Awakening for Earth 
Archangel Uriel has reappeared 
Friends in High Places 
+++ 
Peace Our Beloved 
Q</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So basically both Tom Delonges disclosure project and these alien on twitter guys that have been pretty compelling are both coming to a crescendo and I feel they may be connected and the claims of next week gave me my 10 day estimate</p>

    <div class="md"><p>thats a good question.  I think consciousness is creating reality at different levels of density.  </p>

<p>I think it is not limited to the human body.  Through mediation you can lower your brainwaves to perceive more of your consciousness and less of your physical body.  </p>

<p>It is basically keeping your mind awake as your body falls asleep.  A ton of crazy different feelings like electricity and vibrations and high pitch sounds can happen as you separate your consciousness from your body.<br/>
It is the trippiest coolest weirdest thing i have never experienced.<br/>
The thing about these areas of consciousness is when you are afraid you get negative experiences and if you are confident and fearless you get positive experiences.  Your mind instantly creates your reality in these realms.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>yeah i&#39;ve never done that. I&#39;d imagine this is what channelers do which is why they do some sort of protection mantra or something before. I think these are just confidence boosters and tools for people to use to help protect themselves maybe?</p>

<p>this reality is a denser version of the astral/dream world.  I still believe the power comes from within your own confidence and ability to visualize.  If you are confident in your power to manifest or completely imagine a different senario, that will happen, in this world (slower and much less noticeable) and the astral.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting post, and I agree with many of your suspicions. These are some of the dots I’m still trying to connect and make sense of. </p>

<p>I think you’re right in being suspicious of Delonge. I certainly don’t trust him. At first I thought he was a useful idiot of the deep state, but now I’m leaning more toward him being involved in some of the dark stuff. Still can’t say for certain, though. However, I’m fairly confident that your 10 day prediction won’t pan out. I expect them to release some video footage that raises eyebrows, but it won’t be anything close to actual disclosure.</p>

<p>I’m also highly suspicious of the two twitter accounts you’ve pointed out. I follow both of them because they do say some interesting things on occasion, but I don’t think they’re insiders. I think VictoryOfTheLight has a small pinch of credibility, but Kabamur feels like a straight up LARP (and I really hate using that term). They’ve done their research and shouldn’t be completely dismissed, however. I just think Kabamur is seeking attention when he says he’s an emissary of the Pleiadians</p>

<p>I view disclosure as something like an onion. The aliens or interdimensional forces are much closer to the center of the onion, and the government won’t reveal that information before first peeling back the other layers of the onion. If the institutional pedophilia and ritual abuse are outed by the government, then I’ll have a little more hope of “alien” disclosure. Any other disclosure movements I will view as disinformation, which is what I think is occurring with Delonge</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m with you. It&#39;s all a very confusing situation that is being manipulated by dangerous people. Deep down, I would love for some greater truth to be revealed that would solve all of humanity&#39;s problems and allow us to live in harmony together, but I just can&#39;t see that happening.</p>

<p>I follow VoTL and Kabamur as well for the same reasons as you and share the same skepticism of them. My skepticism for Kabamur skyrocketed when he started posting things in the format of Q. In my opinion, he was just trying to piggyback on the recent interest in the Q posts.</p>

<p>The Tom Delonge situation is suspicious because I just don&#39;t think the most secretive organizations of our government would allow their former employees to go out and freely disclose these allegedly secret technologies with a member of Blink 182. At best, this is disinfo/psyop.</p>

<p>In regards to OP&#39;s opinions on these matters, I do believe that the metaphysical world can be dangerous. However, I think that some of the information put out there is scare tactics used to dissuade humanity from discovering these realities and potentials.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very fair overview, being twitter accounts I agree their credibility is next to none, but having watched their posts they display a level of research and knowledge unusual to the average LARPer as well as the time span</p>

<p>The Pleiadian emissaries have been claiming the Galactic Federation was coming for a long while, they have also claimed that Trump is literally an incarnated alien soul here to take us through the gates of enlightenment along with the intensity of their posts reaching a fever pitch (claims of ground battle in Antarctica, detailed battle plans and progression to a liberation campaign of earth nearing its completion.</p>

<p>Tom committing to at least the launch of his real shit next.</p>

<p>I cant say for sure if it will be 10 days but I have a feeling it will be more than most are prepared for and Tom has made vague statements but would not put himself in a situation to be caught lying like this he said </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is the stuff I want to hear about. I really hope some major mind blowing shit goes down but I&#39;m not expecting anything to happen but man it would be nice.</p>

<p>I think Tom Delonge is either a gatekeeper or limited hangout or both. Maybe he/they have good intentions but I&#39;m not gonna hold my breath... </p>

<p>I had a couple encounters with negative shadow entities and I know there is way more going on than can be perceived by the normal senses. I have a theory that one of the front lines of &quot;the cabal&quot; are operating through various cults that for all outward appearances seem harmless/benign/innocent. It really would be a perfect way of hiding sinister motives. It&#39;s a big &quot;what if&quot; and I literally have no tangible proof but... </p>

<p>Assume the war between the good vs bad &quot;aliens&quot; is more a spiritual war for our minds/hearts and less an external battle. The regular tactics still apply. Deception and divide and conquer. The cabal would be experts at this. So it follows that the deception goes deeper and is more complicated than most people can even begin to comprehend. Hundreds if not thousands of years of preparations and schemes. Layer upon layer of deceptions, distractions, feints and ploys and rabbit holes that seem plausible but lead far from the true enemies or power positions. Not to mention access to the mysteries and esoteric knowledge. Lies in the truth and truth in the lies. So what if the hidden hand is hiding in plain sight? Maybe the real cabal (or at least part of it) convincingly pose as peaceful pacifists but secretly and/or even unknowingly conjure/project negative entities/evil forces that serve various purposes. The &quot;war&quot; is more like 5d chess where even regular chess is a super complex game.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Happened last year, </p>

<p>the man says it himself he was &quot;experimenting with extreme states of consciousness&quot; his manifesto reads very similarly to paranoid schizophrenics thought patterns and I have read that Schizophrenia is likely some type of weapon or disease or something so the person is crazy by human standards but is also true in claiming it is other beings the person doesnt understand doing this to him</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Has anyone tried investigating his claims? Maybe they could try to find the church he was speaking of. I&#39;m not saying the Martians/entities are guaranteed to reveal themselves, but maybe it would shake things up a bit if we showed them that more of us believed the assertions. This reminds me of the John Carpenter movie, &quot;They Live,&quot; which I just looked up is based on a book called &quot;Eight o&#39;clock in the Morning&quot; by Ray Nelson. Anyway, I&#39;d like to know more about Odom and his experiences.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Had an interesting talk with a friend who&#39;s convinced Islam is the religion of truth. First he talked about an experience with a friend, they were at a house in the mountains and went out during the night to turn on water that fills a water tower cuz they were out, it was dark and quiet around them and suddenly they both hear very loud footsteps running for like 3-4 meters then it stops, sounded like something with 2 legs and not an animal, they looked around and saw nothing, there were some bushes where it would&#39;ve been running then a wall, they didn&#39;t see or hear anything after the running, like where would it have gone above the wall? under the wall? would&#39;ve made a sound. That night while trying to sleep they heard some sounds in the house like footsteps above them or scratches on the wall. </p>

<p>Then we talked about an LSD trip he had with his friends in an abandoned tavern in a desert in Egypt, there was probably bad energy there from before and they were all seeing the same things together that the walls were cracking and falling, then he was alone in a room and saw 2-3 short beings with creepy faces said their consciousness felt like vicious dogs, they would try to get close and he&#39;d push them back then he suddenly saw like 20 of those beings around him and were all attacking him trying to crawl up his legs, he could feel their hands on his legs, he&#39;d keep kicking them around, were easy to throw and he would hear the floor when they&#39;d fall. One got on his back he pulled it off and threw it across the room, they all stood back and heard a loud sound then a big shadow being with one red eye, vicious face came through a wall at the end of the room, looked at everything then stared at the guy and turned back. He said he had to control his fear. </p>

<p>Then we talked about Islam, friend knows a very spiritual person that follows Islam who can heal cancer and a birth disorder that causes a big foot and a big arm, dunno what&#39;s called, healed it to normal size in a year, put people to sleep/kill instantly, goes to India and Germany a lot and according to friend wins every test with other spiritualists and satanists...then talked about need for some knowledge to be hidden, need for a spiritual teacher and permission to use certain powers, some aren&#39;t ready or go crazy, there are lot of ways but one that&#39;s always been there as the best/truth. Doesn&#39;t have to be called Islam but the spiritual guy is supposedly very powerful studying lot of books on Islam and interpreting shit out of spiritual text. Said satanists created isis to give Islam a bad name.</p>

<p>Talked about necronomicon, translating from Farsi: &#39;When translation of the book arrived I studied some of it and burned it immediately because there are some truths in there that no one is ready to hear yet and we need a lot more time to understand it. The copy that [Father Varius?] claims on burning was found again in Prague in 1586 but in the hands of people who everyone knew as occultists, Dr. John Dee and his assistant Edward Kelly. According to rumors, after finding this book they both tried to animate the dead. Then the book was gifted to Oxford&#39;s Bodleian library by an antiquary named Elias Ashmole. There are two other copies in the British Museum and the Vatican. A copy in the Bodleian library disappeared in 1934. It&#39;s said (because Hitler was very passionate about metaphysical subjects...&#39; </p>

<p>So whats written can not be taken for 100% fact as its the writing of a  man whos mind is being torn apart but it gives a unique insight into someone who claims they fucked up while astral projecting and started getting stalked by demons</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You may be foolish to seek these entities out.  Evil has only one agenda:  steal, kill and destroy. </p>

<p>These demons are more gifted and powerful than humans. Based on biblical study, I️ would encourage you to pray for God to disarm and defeat these parasitic liars that can easily deceive and destroy you.   Your prayers are powerful bec God hears and is moved by prayer. He has legions of powerful angels who are equipped to battle at the level of the evil beings.  Partner with God through prayer in delivering the world from Satan’s deceptive, obliterating tyranny.  The days are short. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My greatest resource is the Bible where, incidentally, we are given glimpses of this epic battle that encompasses heaven and earth. 2 examples come to mind, Daniel (of the lion’s den) is praying to God for <em>weeks</em>.  When the angel finally gets to him, he explains how he was delayed battling the (earthly) powers in Persia. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>| 12Then he continued, “Do not be afraid, Daniel. Since the first day that you set your mind to gain understanding and to humble yourself before your God, your words were heard, and I have come in response to them. 13But the prince of the Persian kingdom resisted me twenty-one days. Then Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me, because I was detained there with the king of Persia. 14Now I have come to explain to you what will happen to your people in the future, for the vision concerns a time yet to come.”|  Daniel 10</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, Prayer was answered immediately but battle was fought to accomplish its answer.  This does not specify exact words or prayers, just looking and asking God for what we see needs to be made right —that His will be done on earth as in heaven.  Notice that reinforcements were necessary for this more junior angel to get past the demon prince in Persia. </p>

<p>The other is when the prophet had to hold up his arms for God’s power to uphold the victory in battle. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>| 15When the servant of the man of God got up and went out early the next morning, an army with horses and chariots had surrounded the city. “Oh no, my lord! What shall we do?” the servant asked.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>16“Don’t be afraid,” the prophet answered. “Those who are with us are more than those who are with them.”</p>

<p>17And Elisha prayed, “Open his eyes, Lord, so that he may see.” Then the Lord opened the servant’s eyes, and he looked and saw the hills full of horses and chariots of fire all around Elisha.</p>

<p>18As the enemy came down toward him, Elisha prayed to the Lord, “Strike this army with blindness.” So he struck them with blindness, as Elisha had asked.|
2 Kings 6</p>

<p>Again you can see angelic beings battling on behalf of humans by God’s orders. </p>

<p>The Psalms are many times open prayers to God. </p>

<p>There is also the Lord’s Prayer and many examples of the apostles praying. </p>
