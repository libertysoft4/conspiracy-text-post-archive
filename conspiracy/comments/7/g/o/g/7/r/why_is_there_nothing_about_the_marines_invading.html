    <div class="md"><p>You calling something a conspiracy theory doesn&#39;t make it any less credible considering how often CTs end up being based on facts.</p>

<p>You wanna switch gears and talk about 9/11?  You know at this point, people have moved on from 9/11.  There&#39;s been endless evidence showing foul play or at the least big holes in the official stories.  People are so gullible and lazy that it&#39;s almost like they want to be told what to believe.  Doing their own research takes work and believing something nefarious may make it hard for them to sleep at night or live in their happy little bubbles.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I brought up WTC 7 collapse videos on YT as an example of evidence that supports the conspiracy theory that the official 9/11 story is bullshit.  IMHO that footage discredits the official story, and yet those videos don’t get deleted by YT. I’ve seen well produced presentations by structural building engineers and related experts challenging the official story and countering with facts in a believable manner. </p>

<p>This marine CIA coup story doesn’t have any eye witness testimony or video footage indicting irrefutable proof that an actual attack/counter coup occurred.  All I’ve seen is footage of marine aircraft from a distance flying above the base, and YT conspiracy theory channels claiming they’re hearing from anonymous marines saying they seized computers and papers from the CIA. That’s not good enough for me. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think the fact that there&#39;s no footage of the CIA headquarters on YouTube is evidence that it didn&#39;t happen, I mean I doubt many people would be able to get close enough to record and especially if there wasn&#39;t prior notice that something was going down.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don’t need proof for it not happening, I need proof that it did happen. I haven’t seen any credible sources or evidence to suggest that it actually happened.  The best “evidence“ I’ve seen comes from conspiracy theory YouTube channels and similar platforms who make the case that a counter coup went down and offer up supposed eye witness anonymous marines claiming that they were there and did it, as well as pictures of marine aircraft flying around Langley.  </p>

<p>I don’t buy it. That’s not enough evidence to satisfy my burden of proof. </p>

<p>If you want me to believe it’s not a bogus, wishful-thinking make-believe story, then the burden is on whoever claims it happened to provide sufficient evidence to convince people it’s true. </p>

<p>Having lived most of my life around military bases I can tell you that the military does perform exercises with thousands of servicemen from time to time—shocking I know.  Occam’s Razor applies most of the time and it think it applies in this case too. It’s far more likely that it it was just some sort of exercise involving a few 1,000 marines rather than DT secretly sending in marines in sort sort of secret counter coup against disloyal CIA deep state people. </p>

<p>You believe what you want, but I’m not buying it. </p>

<p>In this specific case, I’d need to see interviews  from several individuals that can prove they were on base at the time this supposed counter coup occurred asserting that it in fact happened. There are over 10,000 employees who work on that base, and Trump loves bragging about his victories on Twitter, and yet all the “evidence” I’ve seen is from anonymous sources.  I don’t easily believe accounts from anonymous sources being filtered through conspiracy theorist channels who seem to believe in just about every CT under the sun, like chemtrails. </p>

<p>I need to see more concrete/reliable evidence before I’d believe that anything excited happened at Langley. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I gave you both a dictionary definition and a contextual definition to be throughout; not to be a dick. </p>

<p>The MSM definitely is biased and definitely pushes their agendas, but they have to report the facts from time to time so saying that no MSM is credible is a bit of and over stretch.  It’s not 100% disinformation 100% of the time. When certain stories are big enough/important enough, then they have to report degrees of the truth.  The trouble is picking through the facts from the spins and BS. So I’m very slow to trust the MSM too. I treat their reports with a similar level of skepticism as I do with CTs.  They did the whole BS anonymous sources bit for a year trying to push their fake Trump Russian collusion nonsense for over a year. They dropped that fake news propaganda once the real evidence surfaced and proved that their anonymous sources were full of shit. </p>

<p>If Trump really had the marines raid the CIA, then CNN could easily have spun it in such a way as to make Trump look like he was exceeding his constitutional authority and demonize him. For crying out loud they demonize every damn word and tweet of his that they can. I trust the MSM enough to believe that if this story had any truth behind it that the MSM would be doing everything that they could to convince us all that  Trump went too far and that the Democrats would be screaming bloody murder for his impeachment. But they haven’t reported squat. Is it possible that they’re silent because TPTB are afraid and are desperately trying to regain control? Yes, I suppose it’s theoretically possible, but I seriously doubt it. It’s far more likely that it’s just an invention of extreme conspiracy theorists making a mountain out of a mole hill.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>calling it a larp is so lazy.  Anyone can discredit something.  It&#39;s so easy, costs nothing and puts the onus on the other party to convince you.  You wanna believe it&#39;s a larp, I really don&#39;t care.  It doesn&#39;t change the fact that things are happening.  </p>

<p>Q is a larp that some people want to believe and other people are on a mission from 4chan to push his/her posts here - just so they can laugh at people who believe them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This one is very simple to put to bed. Other countries intelligence services and news media would have no incentive to stay quiet about the CIA being raided. None of the USA&#39;s enemies would pass up such a once in a lifetime opportunity to destabilize things. Furthermore wealthy business interests would be hitting the eject button causing ripples through the global economy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I brought up WTC 7 collapse videos on YT as an example of evidence that supports the conspiracy theory that the official 9/11 story is bullshit.  IMHO that footage discredits the official story, and yet those videos don’t get deleted by YT. I’ve seen well produced presentations by structural building engineers and related experts challenging the official story and countering with facts in a believable manner. </p>

<p>This marine CIA coup story doesn’t have any eye witness testimony or video footage indicting irrefutable proof that an actual attack/counter coup occurred.  All I’ve seen is footage of marine aircraft from a distance flying above the base, and YT conspiracy theory channels claiming they’re hearing from anonymous marines saying they seized computers and papers from the CIA. That’s not good enough for me. </p>
