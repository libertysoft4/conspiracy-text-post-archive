<p>What do you guys think of this quote from Donald Trump:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“I’ve known Jeff for 15 years,” Trump said. “Terrific guy. He’s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it — Jeffrey enjoys his social life.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah... Trump was never in the flight logs. Clinton was.</p>

<p>Very wrong.</p>

<p>Trump was just in the &quot;black book.&quot; So were plenty of other people.</p>

<p>Watch the deposition, where Epstein gets asked about his &quot;egg-shaped&quot; penis.</p>

<p>The lawsuit filed against Trump had no such details.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Epstein’s little black book and flight logs read like a virtual Who’s Who:** Bill Clinton, Donald Trump, Larry Summers, Kevin Spacey, Prince Andrew, and Naomi Campbell all hitched rides on Epstein’s private planes.** Socialites and distinguished scientists went to visit Epstein’s island in St. Thomas, and cavorted at epic dinner parties at his palatial townhouse—then the largest privately owned residence in New York, as he liked to brag. There, they picked at elaborate meals catered by celebrity chefs like Rocco DiSpirito, marvelled at Epstein’s opulent decor, and noted the pack of very, very young model-types with whom Epstein always seemed to surround himself.</p>

<p>It&#39;s dangerous to be delusional.  It&#39;s even more dangerous to outright ignore information that contradicts your strange delusions of Trump <em>not</em> being a sexual predator.</p>

<p>The access hollywood tape is also pointless. Trump has never claimed to be the center of morality, but using that to say that he&#39;s a rapist is ridiculous, much more a child rapist. </p>

<p>The Epstein connection is troubling, I think he&#39;s said something about it saying he didn&#39;t do any of that other stuff, but I find it hard to deny that he is of innocence here. This is just something we either choose to believe or we don&#39;t as there is not much evidence to illegality besides him just being on the plane. </p>

<p>He did say that one thing they have in common together is sex? but I didn&#39;t understand that much. But dude like, there&#39;s other things to harp on him about other than these two comments. Don&#39;t compare Joe Biden to him, none of those pictures are even close to Joe Biden creepy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look dude I totally agree that it&#39;s weird, and trump has more than proven that he has no tact. But this is just stupid to argue about. My guide to whether trump is a good person or not is not based on one sentence he said. He&#39;s said so many more questionable things but that is all they are.</p>

<p>This sub is about conspiracies not about nitpicking weird shit trump says. It&#39;s just such a stupid and argument, I don&#39;t want to have to defend trumps tact less comments.</p>

<p>A real conspiracy is that Trump is surrounded by ashekenazis. That lots of his donors and advisers are them.</p>

<p>Even still, it&#39;s definable actions that show what a person is, so until Trump has been proven to do something, I&#39;m not going to claim he&#39;s some MONSTER. I just think he&#39;s creepy towards women/girls.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll look into that, thanks.</p>

<p>And when you&#39;re a star, they let you do it</p>

<p>Sounds an awful lot like consent to me; seriously, some of you people really need to work on critical thinking skills. Trump isn&#39;t in the flight logs, he&#39;s in &quot;the little black book&quot;. People used to keep books with all their contacts information, we didn&#39;t have smart phones back then. Trump testified against him.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“I’ve known Jeff for 15 years,” Trump said. “Terrific guy. He’s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it — Jeffrey enjoys his social life.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This sounds like him dropping bread crumbs for people that are looking for them; why would he mention &quot;many of them are on the younger side&quot;? It&#39;s like him casually saying &quot;everyone knows of course, Hillary&#39;s belief it takes a village...which only makes sense of course because in places like Haiti, she&#39;s taken a number of them&quot; in his speech at the Al Smith Dinner.</p>

<p>Either one is crazy.  Maybe trump got caught in a brownstone op back in the day, but in doing so he got dirt on all the other child bangers too.  Maybe he will jump on the sword and martyr himself and take all the other pedos down with him.

<blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, the Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach last night confirmed a Web site report that Epstein has been banned there. “He would use the spa to try to procure girls. But one of them, a masseuse about 18 years old, he tried to get her to do things,” a source told us. “Her father found out about it and went absolutely ape-[bleep]. Epstein’s not allowed back.” Epstein denies he is banned from Mar-a-Lago and says, in fact, he was recently invited to an event there.   </p>
