<p>Considering they corrected it the same day, the long term political outcome would be negligible. The only theory I&#39;ve seen that makes sense would be the market manipulation explanation (not that I think that&#39;s necessarily true).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The way I see it is he has plead guilty to the stuff that there was irrefutable evidence for and now he&#39;s going to be giving them evidence on other things in exchange for not facing the kidnapping charges that would have been assumed at him and his moron of a son. I remember this story about Flynn meeting the Russians and telling them not to retaliate for Obama ejecting all the Russians at the time it was reported so yes that isn&#39;t new, but the fact that Flynn is now going to testify against the trump campaign, and that the stuff he&#39;s offered meuller is spicy enough to get him off the hook for the other stuff he&#39;s done. That&#39;s the new part of this, he was a very key member of the administration, he&#39;s probably got some really good info. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Another comment though. In all reality we already knew he was &quot;guilty of lying&quot; if not he wouldn&#39;t have been fired. Like I said it still seems just continuation of what already happened not a bombshell or revelation like some would suggest.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fnarley, he lied about making calls that were not illegal.  By not flipping means he would plead the 5th.  By pleading the 5th in Federal court means he cannot be pardoned.  Flynn is doing the right thing by supporting Mueller in his investigation.  Flynn has to do what is right for him.  By supporting Mueller means he was cooperative and can later be pardoned.  At this point that is all we can assume.  If he has dirt, great.  He will share the dirt.  Special Counsel has all the information they want because the entire Trump team was unmasked.  The dossier has proven to be a political smear campaign paid by Clinton and FBI. A lot of people on both sides will be in trouble over this but most will be at Flynn level. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was paid for by a republican donor as opposition research against trump then when trump won Fusion sold the project to the Clinton campaign. </p>

<p>This WaPo article is a good summary, most of the dossier claims are unverified, but that doesn&#39;t make them untrue either</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nice try Fnarley and WaPo?  Clinton Campaign paid for it in April! Trump had not won the primaries until May.  After Clinton paid we have Obama Admin, FBI and Podesta Group paying for the dossier.  </p>

<p>They took what Bush paid for a year earlier which isn&#39;t the Dossier with Russian elements.     </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes.  Fixing a mistake after the market closes is total bullshit.  ABC made 1 very important error on a major story that impacted the market.  People lost money and people most likely lost their jobs.  FAKE NEWS on a story this big has major repercussions.  Cry all you want about Fox.  I&#39;m not a fan of Fox either but they didn&#39;t break the story ABC did.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think people need to step back, and look at the situation. OP is saying it was intentional, whereas I think it&#39;s willful ignorance. The news isn&#39;t about publizing something arrcuately, it&#39;s about publizing it first(immediately) and what tackles a back seat is quality and all distorted titles unrelated to the article. The consumption of media has changed, so how can you not expect the mainstream media to be altered as well.</p>

<p>I do agree with the partisanship displayed by ABC and believe this post is warranted under this subreddit because it evoked critical thinking.</p>

<p>Cheers. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t see it as willful ignorance.  We have a veteran reporter involved.  We could certainly blame the media for not condoning journalist integrity to support a narrative.  That has lead to these types of stories.  The one little IMPORTANT aspect of that story is what made it a bombshell.  Without that key piece of information - its news everyone expected because it was already known. </p>
