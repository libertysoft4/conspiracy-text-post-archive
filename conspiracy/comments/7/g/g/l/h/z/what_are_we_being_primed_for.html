It seems the public is being trained to pass judgement before any sort of due process can be conducted, i.e. allegations hit and immediately twitter/fb lights up with outrage. </p>

<p>It seems thr powers that be are attempting to train us to forget about due process and jump right to guilt as soon as an allegation presents itself. </p>

<p>Though these allegations tend to carry weight, my fear is that they will be able to use this support fot action in spite of any lack of evidence or result of investigation for other purposes and to shut down free speech, pre-crime, etc. </p>

<p>Am I crazy, or is anyone else noticing this as well? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Think you&#39;ve got it backwards.  Accusations of sexual misconduct aren&#39;t going to be used to shut down free speech, they&#39;re an example of free speech in action.  The formal power structures, such as the criminal justice system or HR departments, generally does not work for or is unavailable to the victims of harassment or assault.  In lieu of that they turn to the one avenue still open to them, and due to the decentralization of media and women&#39;s greater recognition/power relative to the past, their speech has a distribution and influence it couldn&#39;t have back when the old boy&#39;s network had a greater ability to censor the public narrative.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you honestly worried about that?  Manafort has been a major political player and conduit to Russian money for decades.  He was directly employed by the podesta group.</p>

<p>Why do you think that after decades of political involvement at the highest levels, and direct involvement with the campaign managers of people pushing the Russia narrative like McCain and Clinton, he is only in trouble now, under the trump administration?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Funny, I just posted a similar comment in r/news. My thought is they are preparing us for the Purge. How is the average person going to go from defending Hillary Clinton&#39;s reputation in feminist forums to finding out she is a human trafficker and involved in pedo crimes? They are training us to accept our loveable heros as sex predators, normalizing the revelation shock. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Both, I think evidence and proof of Hillary&#39;s illegal activities lies in her deleted emails, and also on Anthony Weiner&#39;s laptop.  The video proof that made FBI agents &quot;tear up&quot; is in the &quot;insurance&quot; file on Weiner&#39;s laptop.  Right now the FBI/CIA are undergoing a coup of sorts (Vegas shooting is related) and while that gets sorted out we wait. It seems there are enough &quot;white hats&quot; in the FBI and NYPD that the outcome of all this looks positive.<br/>
My original point was that, face it, the masses are not yet &quot;woke&quot;. Most democrats have conditioned themselves to like and defend, if not worship HRC.  They have had to manipulate their own thinking to an extreme degree to think she is likeable, electable, and not entirely corrupt.  An abrupt headline of &quot;Hillary Clinton indicted on racketeering, human trafficking, election fraud, and treason&quot; would cause an immediate freak out and possible rebellion. (how today&#39;s tech addicted masses would rebel is beyond my imagination, I assume lots of glitter and swearing would be involved, possibly even emojis). If indeed the entire globalist cabal is coming to its end, the masses need to be prepared for this incredible revelation of corruption throughout the entire government.  I think that this might be the angle with the current sex predator accusation trend.  America idolizes the rich and famous, particularly famous actors, so first, destroy our perfect image of them by revealing their sexual deviancy, and do it over and over again, then by the time politicians start to go down, everyone will be over it.  Not unlike the Vegas shooting.  How long before the largest mass shooting event in US history was completely on the back burner? Maybe a week and a half, two weeks? Isnt that amazing? Just to see how the masses have been conditioned is so disturbing to me. Anyway, hope that clarifies my thoughts a bit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That seems to make more sense.  Nearly all the major players being taken down are big Hillary supporters.  In KSA also, alaweed was a huge Clinton/neocon/cia ally, next in line for the throne.  A short while after trump&#39;s visit there was a coup, and now he&#39;s being stripped of his power and fortune.  Maybe they are setting up for the same thing here.</p>
