<p>Exactly. The official narrative would be damn near impossible.</p>

<p>No dice. They were all functioning, that place is one of the most guarded places on earth. They have cameras everywhere. They were working, but they show something that contradicts the &quot;official&quot; conspiracy theory, and that is what it really is. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>An abundance of cameras is one thing but there are highways on literally every side of the pentagon.    The side that was hit is the most visible of the sides too.    I’ve known a lot of Washingtonians that saw the damage first hand and not one has explicitly said they saw a plane.    Not one.    And they all seem to imply there may not have been one to be seen.     Of course driving by at 55mph on the most traumatic of days may not be ideal for investigation but there were also plenty who biked to the scene and saw nothing.    What I am curious about are the south facing windows from all the hotels in the area.     There’s a giant mall two blocks away as well.   Eyewitness testimony should have been abundant but I’ve never heard anyone say they saw a plane.     The story isn’t cold though.   We’ll find out the truth in time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It’s been 60 years since JFK and we still act unsure about what really happened.    (Which also means the official story is a dud.)    If 9/11 is let slide I think it would be the last time the real nazis would doubt themselves.      And the internet could spoil things at any moment but the major social networks are falling in line with the authoritarians by censoring and otherwise manipulating what’s in the public discourse.   Algorithms.   The other component is how much people care and how they’ll engage the issue.    I feel like truth movements aren’t becoming more effective but are gaining a larger audience just by their own virtue.    And with the internet that base can perceive a solidarity and stay engaged to whatever extent possible.    The big hurdle is the ground game in Washington.   Does any researcher, media group, advocate, investigator, victim, politician, or anyone else feel like they could make inroads in DC?     If state crimes are the charge how is it exposed?     State crimes are effectively halted by the fear of being caught, so kowledge really is power.    I think people are generally becoming quicker to call foul and are far better investigators than what the traditional media would give them credit for.    So for 9/11, people will always know it’s bullshit for us and the world at large, but Zeitgeist and Loose Change have proven to be formidable, and I think all state level events of the future will be judged on how they hold up to this type of scrutiny.     Long story made short, we may never get the videos or authenticate the passports, but we can ridicule them until they put up, make them eternally defensive, and hope they slip up from fatigue if they ever attempt something similar in the future.    </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Excellent points made, man.  I&#39;d agree that they&#39;d figure that if they could get away with 9/11, they&#39;d be good further down the road.  This to me is why I felt like the momentum behind the initial Podesta e-mail release and ensuing pizzagate research had the biggest potential to open up that can of worms, and expose some serious truth.  No way in hell would anyone want to be associated with the one thing everyone in the their right mind would lose their shit about and protect: kids.  </p>

<p>This child sex trafficking business is a global affair, and one of the ways they keep the ones at the &quot;top&quot; complicit.  Reveal that to the masses and it&#39;d we&#39;d be surely facing the beginning of the end.</p>

<p>That rabbit hole runs deep. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What is a flying device that explodes on impact?</p>

<p>Payload = Jet Fuel /kerosene or High explosive warhead.</p>

<p>Missiles are designed to explode after collision with the target to wreak maximum damage.</p>

<p>Look at the pictures of the impact zone and how many rings it went through, then ask wheres the impact of a plane vs missile.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If the object that hit the Pentagon wasn&#39;t a plane, then what happened to those people who allegedly boarded flight 77? The two main theories of flight 77 range from simple to elaborate so I&#39;ll spare the details(because I&#39;ll introduce my own crazy theory), however, they have one thing in common: in both cases the passengers of flight 77 are &#39;deceased&#39;.   </p>

<p>What if that wasn&#39;t the case? What if the passengers of the plane were instead shipped off to Mossad(or NK) to work as slaves? It&#39;s not like human trafficking isn&#39;t one of most lucrative businesses in the world. What good is a dead human(I guess unless you do the killing..) when you could have an enslaved one that everyone in the world thinks is dead?   </p>

<p>I think it would be a grave mistake to imagine that Navy intelligence are the good guys here. However I agree with your general view that evidence of financial crime was clearly destroyed, and investigations targeted, on 9/11. This view ties together the Pentagon attack with the destruction of the towers and WTC7.</p>

<p>FWIW I definitely think this. Sounded crazy to me at first, but when you think about it, it&#39;s simply Hollywood FX passed off as news. Just 3D computer graphics layered onto live video and a bunch of actors LARPing as witnesses. And we know CNN etc has done this sort of thing before with green screens, fake witnesses, and such. All the world&#39;s a stage.</p>

<p>9/11 was just a big magic trick, intended to justify the wars in the Middle East.</p>
