    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been on both ends of the whole provide my source/evidence. I understand the importance of providing a source but i guess it&#39;s a little frustrating having to do the research for someone who obviously isn&#39;t that devoted enough to the topic to do that little bit of googling. Like sure lemme dig through my internet history for weeks or months worth of research for some proof that the other person could most likely give a shit about or stop reading when they see something that goes against what they believe as fact, then it&#39;s a debate about a little thing and we&#39;re no longer talking about the main topic.  When I asked for people to provide their evidence or source for something I was curious about back when I first started getting into conspiracies and they told me to google it, I didn&#39;t think they were bullshitting me, I just looked it up for myself</p>

<p>Conspiracy innately is about secrecy and ill deeds, however this is not a picture of the entire world.</p>

<p>It really helps me after interacting with Conspiracy to remind myself how awesome people can be. Try watching some of these videos and the opposite effect happens. You will feel inspired and amazed by the world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for this comment. Personally I&#39;ve been on the conspiracy hunt since my early teens (18+ years now) and it&#39;s very easy to become overwhelmed and anxious at all the information presented here. My belief is that this is intentional. If people are going to be aware of all the negative things done let&#39;s at least overwhelm them so much that they become static in the anxiety of it all. What has helped me loads is that it has made me a much more spiritual person. It&#39;s helped me realize that our consciousness does create our reality so as individuals we have the power to overcome all the negativity by being good to others and just as importantly good to myself. It&#39;s helped me get clean of a decade long drug addiction and the mental health issues that come with such a situation. As has been said many times before, Be the light you wish to see in the world. We don&#39;t need violent revolution, that would be playing directly into their hands. We need to do nothing more than be good to one another, stop with all this divisive left right, black white, us vs them mentality and just treat each other with kindness. </p>
