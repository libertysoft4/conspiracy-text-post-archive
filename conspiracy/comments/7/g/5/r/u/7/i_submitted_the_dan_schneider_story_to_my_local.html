        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>In my opinion, Dan Schneider is a creepy old man who sexualises children and minors in his shows. I noticed that Reddit was one of the few sites that discussed his odd behaviour, so I thought getting it through to quite a large newspaper would get it some more public eye. If you want to see an image of the email i sent to them just say. </p>

<p>If you feel like Schneider hasn&#39;t got enough of a spotlight on him, I recommend you do the same with your local news station/paper/website.</p>

<p>EDIT: Nobody specifically asked for the email, but I thought I&#39;d link it anyway for reference. I&#39;ve obviously hidden email addresses and locations, <a href="https://i.imgur.com/DRdpRCX.png">https://i.imgur.com/DRdpRCX.png</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>He is accused of being a pedophile, sexualising minors in his shows and having a foot fetish that is acted out through children. A few people have spoken out about experiences they had with him. Robert Downey Jr has commented on him too, he&#39;s just a very questionable guy who seem people believe to be the father of a child that was birthed by an abused Nick actress</p>

<p>Can everybody stop downvoting him though, there is really no need, he only asked a question </p>

    <div class="md"><p>But why is he being accused of being a pedophile? His shows probably sexualized children less than the other networks. As far as foot fetishes go, I never understood why people are into that myself, but it has nothing to do with pedophilia. </p>

<p>I looked up the RDJ thing, it seems it&#39;s just a rumor that a supposed internet whistleblower was him. I&#39;d take that info with a grain of salt if nothing&#39;s been corroborated, especially with all the real sex abuse info coming out rn</p>

<p>Honestly I think it&#39;s just the fact that he&#39;s an ugly looking middle aged man who works on kids shows. But there&#39;s a good chance he&#39;s a normal dude who found his niche</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not that I’m denying these claims, but I don’t see how shows like Zoey 101, drake and josh, and whatever else he was involved with, sexualizing children.</p>

<p>I grew up with these shows and I remember my hormonal 10-12 year old self being annoyed that these shows don’t accurately represent true issues kids deal with regarding sex and stuff.</p>

<p>So id argue against it. I can’t say what happens behind the scenes, I’ve never even looked twice into accusations against him. But from my own personal experience his shows were on the innocent side, considering in the same time Secret Life of the American Teenager came our and that was 100x in the opposite direction.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He should have been outed already, but here is where the story gets complicated.  The people coming out now for former abuse are mostly adults.  The kids under Schneider have helicopter parents that want their kids to get rich. Ie. get them rich. Plus, young kids are less likely to report it for whatever reason.  Look at The Corey&#39;s. This is all speculation on my part of course.</p>
