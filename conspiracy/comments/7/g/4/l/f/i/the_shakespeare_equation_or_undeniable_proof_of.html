        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>A man named Alan Green has spent over 12 years attempting to crack a code that Shakespeare has left for us.</p>

<p>The best introduction to his work is an incredible elucidation of sacred geometry, mathematical constants, and geodesy on the Shakespeare Sonnets cover page.</p>

<p>The video is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHiad18ZwcY">here</a>. I <em>highly</em> recommend watching the video, but if not, there are four dots and two lines placed serruptiously on the page. When they are connected, they make multiple right angle triangles, a pythagoraen triangle, and their ratios encode <a href="http://imgur.com/a/bNImI">12 fundamental constants.</a> The constants are encoded by simply ratios of the triangle lengths, and all to an accuracy of at least 3 decimals. Golden sections, squaring the circle, and more are all present as well.</p>

<p>For those who want to check the math, the measurements, and the possibility that this could come about by chance, <a href="http://www.tobeornottobe.org/math">here</a> are PDFs for you.</p>

<p>The end of the video is astounding, and I don&#39;t want to spoil it, so <strong>spoiler alert.</strong></p>

<p>The cover has properties laid out similarly to old maps, with a G signifying the Earth, and NE for coordinates.</p>

<p>When you measure two of the angles in the triangles, by N and e respectively, for north and east, you get the Great Pyramid <a href="http://imgur.com/a/8R7by">coordinates within 300m</a>. Longitude is 99.99%, Latitude is just about 99.999% accurate, while longitude <em>which hadn&#39;t been yet been &#39;discovered&#39; [actually hadn&#39;t been released, the Empire had military superiority to keep after all]</em> is about 300m off, or 99.9999% accurate.</p>

<h1>Implications</h1>

<p>This practically <em>proves</em> that advanced esoteric information was given to Shakespeare, and most likely passed down - it pretty much points out that the source of this knowledge was ancient egypt.</p>

<p>Remember, the most influential western thinkers that basically birthed western thought spent time learning in Egypt.</p>

<p>Plato studied at the Temple of Waset for 11 years; Aristotle was there for 11-13 years; Socrates 15 years Euclid stayed for 10-11 years; Pythegoras for 22 yeasrs; Hypocrates studies for 20 years.</p>

<p>I run <a href="/r/holofractal">/r/holofractal</a> - the work of Nassim Haramein which essentially proves an ancient unified global civilization had also intimate knowledge of physics - sacred geometry such as the flower of life literally symbolizing the structure of space at the planck scale. </p>

<p>It&#39;s looking more and more like Graham Hancock is completely correct - there was an ancient, advanced, globe-spanning civilization that had high knowledge, and perhaps after catastrophe, encoded their knowledge in stone monuments and passed down secrets in mystery schools for millenia. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have heard of that long ago, John Dee was an interesting fellow.</p>

<p>That said, I have always failed to see the “hidden” links with these things.  It is well known that the ancients discovered geometry and held it sacred, in college I took a few classes on math history and proofs for a minor, it is not secret at all, there is a direct line from the ancients’ study of geometry and other maths to the development of every branch of math we have today...  very, very cool stuff, but less “secret” and more “niche” in that if you don’t study it at a university level you may not realize all of this.</p>

<p>I know it is easy to think there is some super advanced ancient society, but for all of the threads dealing with this, I like to point out that these guys were no different mentally than us, and they had less crazy hormones pumped into them...  imagine how much we could do in the absence of all the distractions like television or reddit.  If you have no light pollution, the night sky is astounding...  and when you consider <em>that</em> was the most amazing thing to behold that every race on earth could enjoy, it is little wonder all these cultures became obsessed with it...  there was literally nothing to compare to the sheer breathtaking beauty of the night sky back then.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>you are detracting from the Shakespeare equation for the wrong points. the fact that there are these messages encoded into the texts of Shakespeare is what is remarkable. the circumference of the earth, the distance to the sun, the distance to the moon, the circumference of the moon etc. the Stratford heist is super interesting and well presented and if you are not curious about it then you are not much of a conspiracy theorist. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I will admit that I have not gone deep into it enough to really get into.</p>

<p>Just wanted to make a point about math and geometry.  Anyone, yourself included, interested in this should read some about the actual history of math and follow some of the ancient proofs.  They are amazingly elegant and worth learning just for knowledge’s sake.  It will also shed some light when <em>some</em> of the conspiracy proponents mislead about maths, you will know it when it happens because math, particularly classical math, is 100% provable and verifiable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That was when this whole thing jumped from neato sounding compelling video to absolute fact, for me. I couldn’t think of anything else for weeks, months, and this was over a year ago. It’s mind blowing. We didn’t even record someone trying to figure out the speed of light until after the sonnets were published, and that person was off by 26%. Dee got it 99% accurate (he was working with whole numbers for the Shakespeare equation). </p>

<p>Do we have pictures of other books of that year by that publisher?  Do they all have the lines for writing inscriptions?  This is important to know.</p>

<p>Given that (among other things) what is required to designate a unique circle is <em>three coplanar points</em>. How many other circles and angles can be made from that page?  Do any other numbers come up?  What about any other books from this printer and year?</p>

<p>The math works, the formula is consistent, it all matches up with the words used, Alan all but proves it’s actually John Dee, Dee was the most famous cryptographer of the era etc. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is neat, but something stood out to my skeptical mind:  all the omitted angles and circles possible!</p>

<p>But even of the points chosen, many were ignored.  I downloaded the picture and tried to remember the set equations, I believe it would be a factorial series form, but whatever...  anyway, just from the points highlighted 90% of the possible triangles were ignored, that leaves off an amount greater than 4 million possible ratios (and I am pretty sure my math is wrong and it should be much higher!)</p>

<p>Anyway, point is that any huge number of rations are possible, but being that <em>all of them deal with triangles</em> it is quite unsurprising that we derive these ratios.  As a matter of fact probability says that there are many others that will give a <em>better</em> approximation of pi, with far more digits, than what is there so far!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, please excuse this a bit, it has been 8years since I took statistics so I am fuzzy on the actual formulas...</p>

<p>Given the points selected, there are many more possible triangles to create by connecting any 3 points into a unique triangle, it goes something like (9x7x6x5x4x3x2x1)/(9-2) using the nine points highlighted...</p>

<p>Also any 3 points will make a unique circle, so we also have that many possible unique circles...</p>

<p>I explained in another comment that the nature of typeface is that it makes all periods or dots occur on an even grid, they are never random.  Being that a page is somewhere around 8” x 11”, the probability of having triangles on a page that are 3”x 4” x 5” is actually very very high, thus meaning we can get the same ratios from <em>any</em> random printed page.</p>

<p>It is all coincidence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i should clarify.  the vid shows selecting specifically chosen triangles inscribed in a circle (for instance there&#39;s a 3-4-5 in there) teases out well known constants like phi, pi, etc.  this is interesting in that you can take known rational number scaled things and derive irrational number values from it, and go backwards.  i reckon this approach can be used to square the circle.  i think it&#39;s alluded to in the vid but not actually done.     </p>

    <div class="md"><p>fair questions.  i don&#39;t have the answer but rather a hypothesis - that an exact algebraic value (ie. not a limit of something) for these irrational and transcendental numbers can be found and that the bard code hints at it.  whether this is true or not i can&#39;t say for sure.  i suspect it&#39;s the case because the selection of the points in the bard code seems to be exactly chosen geometrically.  <em>if</em> these points can be represented exactly geometrically (and thus algebraically), and <em>if</em> the derivation of the aforementioned constants (and not just approximations!) can be made from these points then there&#39;d be an algebraic representation of these constants. </p>

<p>also re: pi.   pi can be represented algebraically - ie. C/d.  i think you mean that it can&#39;t be represented as a fraction of integers.  i&#39;m not even going there.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>All algebraic numbers have a finite expression as the solution of an algebra problem involving rational coefficients.  Pi, being transcendental, does not have a finite expression.  From this we also know that constructing a square whose area is the same as a given circle (following the rules of Euclidean geometry) is impossible.  This impossibility was a modern discovery.  The greeks had no proof if it was possible or not.</p>

These ratios were know for ages, and many other mathematicians had already found the “breakthroughs” it was just that these were never widely published and rigorously proven in the same way.  The credit that Euler and Newton and several others get is <em>actually</em> due to the printing press more than their own skill, they were able to reach the masses where before the same info only reached a small minority of people.  Also the shift in attitudes of the enlightenment where men could gain fame and money by <em>openly sharing</em> these things rather than keeping them “trade secrets” and only teaching to apprentices.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, this is like a rather large “debate” in math and math history, there are plenty of people who point out (although this seems outdated to me now) that Newton gets all the credit even though Euler and Riemann laid all the groundwork and Euler “discovered” much of the same stuff independently.  I am not personally that invested in this, but taking math history and proofs I came to find that many of the professors have strong opinions here.</p>

<p>The reality is that all math is built in stepping stones, and no one person really invents anything (Einstein is somewhat different I <em>think</em> but I never made it to that level since I was completing a minor, would love to someday).</p>

<p>In reality, even “Calculus” was known and used by some people long before Euler and Newton, some of it not ever rigorously proven, some simply never reaching a wide audience.  That, again, is why I say the printing press was as integral (lol) to Newton and Euler “inventing” calculus as their own work because it was the first time that such work could easily be shared with a worldwide audience (the general spirit of the era deserves some credit also).</p>

<p>As to the wording: I think invented is correct because they did not discover mathematical formulas (no one does, they invent or create them), they took several areas of mathematical study and unified them and adapted them into what we call calculus and three rigorously proved them.

<p>I take it, since you say &quot;simulation&quot; rather than reality, you are a religious person?  That is a rather religious belief, intelligent design, whether you call the creator God or any other name.</p>

<p>The speed of light really is a special parameter...

<p>Shakespeare is supposed to be Francis Bacon right?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Always thought Malcolm X had a theory that was at least fun:</p>

<p><em>&quot;The King James translation of the Bible is considered the greatest piece of literature in English. Its language supposedly represents the ultimate in using the King&#39;s English. Well, Shakespeare&#39;s language and the Bible&#39;s language are one and the same. They say that from 1604 to 1611, King James got poets to translate, to write the Bible. Well, if Shakespeare existed, he was then the top poet around. But Shakespeare is nowhere reported connected with the Bible. If he existed, why didn&#39;t King James use him? And if he did use him why is it one of the world&#39;s best kept secrets?</em></p>

<p><em>I know that many say that Francis Bacon was Shakespeare. If that is true, why would Bacon have kept it secret? Bacon wasn&#39;t royalty, when royalty sometimes used the nom de plume because it was &#39;improper&#39; for royalty to be artistic or theatrical. What would Bacon have had to lose? Bacon, in fact, would have had everything to gain.</em></p>

<p><em>In the prison debates I argued for the theory that King James himself was the real poet who used the nom de plume Shakespeare. King James was brilliant. He was the greatest king who ever sat on the British throne. Who else among royalty, in his time, would have had the giant talent to write Shakespeare&#39;s work? It was he who poetically &#39;fixed&#39; the Bible - which in itself and its present King James version has enslaved the world.&quot;</em></p>

<p>Also a great allusion to Christianity&#39;s enslavement of the world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is a pretty intriguing theory. I didn&#39;t know much about King James but after reading his wiki, he lived quite an interesting life... usually I would say royalty is too pampered to bother to create anything inspired but with him its certainly possible. I have seen a lot of evidence by groups like rosicrucians that claim francis bacon was Shakespeare, so still kinda think they may be right.... but it could also easily be a collaborative effort with most of the literary elite in that time.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fun thought.  The biggest point against King James being the author is the tremendous insight into humanity that the author shows.  He portrayed everybody from the peasant to royalty with depth and accuracy.  It is hard to fathom a king ever having enough contact with the lower classes to be able to write them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think this is cool, mathematics are interesting in general.</p>

<p>There is an irony, however, in this guy’s studies...  <em>he is chasing the same things as those he is studying who assumed the same things about the knowledge of the ancients!</em></p>

<p>There was not any more answer to it in the renaissance than there is now...  he doesn’t realize it but he already knows more than they did!</p>

<p>These ratios were known and held sacred, but the later thinkers were just like him trying to “put it all together” as well and they thought the ancients had “hidden knowledge” too (which is true to a degree, the dark ages saw the diffusion of so much gained knowledge).  </p>

<p>Just like now, all this coincidence must “mean something” right?  That is exactly what Shakespeare or Dee or whoever thought also!  The good news is that for the most part, that quest lead to modern math and science!  The secret is in the screen you are reading this on.</p>

<p>The dead giveaway is that promotional posters for the debut of of Hamlet (the play based on the Kalevala and the Amlodh) show it as having two different debuts, which the players and backers of the <em>Globe</em> would have known would cause confusion among the pubic. the explanation of which is one collaborative groups&#39; play was debuted one day, and another collaborative groups&#39; play on a completely separate day, far enough apart for each play to have it&#39;s own identity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I did a lot of work into this when I saw this video a few months ago.  </p>

<p>First, the most interesting thing about it from a historical perspective is that the alter (by Shakespeare&#39;s tomb I think) they did the ultrasound (not sure what tech) of, was hollow and may have undiscovered works stored it it.  However, the Shakespearean society would never acknowledge it or even consider opening it.</p>

<p>The biggest claim is, of course, the sacred geometry.  I actually laid out a cover of Shakespeare&#39;s Sonnets to scale in photoshop and attempted to measure these angles myself.  What I found was that the consistency in getting the fundamental constants was wildly variable due to the size of the points.  </p>

<p>All in all it did not end up perfect and I really did give it a significant amount of effort to try to make it work the way Green said it did.</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s a very interesting set of ideas. However, a lot of questions need to be answered.  The printing of the time, the way geography was charted at the time, and a number of other factors have to be accounted for before we could conclude beyond reasonable doubt that this was the intention of the person who drew the cover of the Sonnets. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In video about the tomb you&#39;re describing (not a tomb but the altar in Shakespeare&#39;s hometown church), Green provides a code from John Dee&#39;s tablets that ties the whole thing together.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, if you try and work then code out for yourself - it goes nowhere. Either Green is a hoaxer or he neglected to provide the steps necessary to prove his claims. Occam&#39;s razor certaintly cuts towards the former.</p>

<p>The sacred geometry games are just that - it&#39;s not that hard to impose these kinds of &quot;synchronicities&quot; if you let yourself bend the rules when it&#39;s convenient. </p>

<p>The biggest claim is, of course, the sacred geometry. I actually laid out a cover of Shakespeare&#39;s Sonnets to scale in photoshop and attempted to measure these angles myself.

<p>FWIW, the points had to be differently sized for it to work.</p>

<p>Alan wrote about it in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHiad18ZwcY&amp;amp;lc=Ugh0xAlacHxqNXgCoAEC">this comment</a> - he also has a huge section of PDF&#39;s going into it.</p>

<p>This practically proves that advanced esoteric information was given to Shakespeare, and most likely passed down</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No it doesn&#39;t. You&#39;re saying he was given all of this information (by whom?) and sworn to secrecy (why?). Then he decided that, instead of just outright telling everybody, he encoded his writings in such a way that we STILL haven&#39;t decoded it despite already figuring out these &quot;secrets&quot; on our own. That makes no sense.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>it pretty much points out that the source of this knowledge was ancient egypt.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Logical leaps on top of logical leaps. So Shakespeare travelled all the way to Egypt (during the early Ottoman occupation and around the time of civil war) despite his humble means and lack of military connections?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Plato studied at the Temple of Waset for 11 years; Aristotle was there for 11-13 years; Socrates 15 years Euclid stayed for 10-11 years; Pythegoras for 22 yeasrs; Hypocrates studies for 20 years.</p>

<p>Yeah, a lot of ancient greek and roman philosophers studied in Egypt. It was kind of the thing to do. </p>

<p>Oh no, there goes 100% of you credibility.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>which essentially proves an ancient unified global civilization had also intimate knowledge of physics</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No......just no. His work provides no proof whatsoever of anything other than the fact that people will believe anything if you put it in a book. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>sacred geometry such as the flower of life literally symbolizing the structure of space at the planck scale.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How do you know that? Have you observed the structure of space at the planck scale? How did you do so without violating quantum mechanics? You should share the method for how you did that with the rest of us because it would literally be the greatest scientific discovery in history.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s looking more and more like Graham Hancock is completely correct - there was an ancient, advanced, globe-spanning civilization that had high knowledge, and perhaps after catastrophe, encoded their knowledge in stone monuments and passed down secrets in mystery schools for millenia.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Green&#39;s work is fraudulent as far as I can tell, but the implication would be that the Rosicucians were the secret society that imparted the wisdom.</p>

<p>Dee is often credited with founding the movement as part of a Protestant union in Bohemia (as suggested by Francis Yates in the Rosicrucian Enlightenment). The original Rosicurcians at least took great inspiration from Dee, and adapted his Monas Hieroglyphica text &amp; symbol for their original manifestos.</p>

<p>Those original manifestos refer to their founder, Christian Rosencruez, becoming an Enlightened Master in the 1200&#39;s, traveling all over the East and learning the secrets of life, the universe, everything. His (empty) tomb is described as containing lamps that burned eternally through the centuries, which the pyramidiots look towards as evidence of an infinite power source.</p>

<p>Basically, Green is rewriting the Da Vinci code, but with Shakespeare. He even admits to it in one of his videos, before claiming that his research for the fiction turned into a real world mystery.</p>

<p>No it didn&#39;t, Alan. </p>

That goes against everything we know about human behavior. Humans want to share and apply knowledge that they gain.

    <div class="md"><p>Well the Dark Ages punished any wisdom that conflicted with the accepted truths of the era. Dee and the Rosicrucians tried to kickstart the scientific revolution - Dee was relatively successful, although the Rosicrucians were all killed (battle of white mountain). You can find countless examples of astronomers that were killed for trying to advance knowledge. All alternative healers were burned as witches. Alchemists had to work in secret to make their advances.</p>

<p>Why? Social control. The same reason the United States gutted its education system and continues to let it rot. No one can identify that we live in a corporate oligarchy if they don&#39;t understand how to critically process the information they&#39;re given. They will believe what they&#39;re told, they will go where you lead them - sheep, if you will.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe in the fringe histories for the most part, but there&#39;s a reason that the original Bavarian illuminati operated as an enlightenment society in secret - and why the king had them banned, outed, and scattered into the wind.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Uh, I did watch the video (I thought his smug tone was nearly intolerable, personally). He doesn&#39;t even provide units for his measurements or precision for the measurement of his angles. By the values I&#39;m guessing it was in millimeters, but that presents another problem. For him to get exactly Euler&#39;s constant or Phi he needs precision to 3 places. This means his measurements had to be precise to hundredths of a millimeter. That&#39;s smaller than the human eye can distinguish.</p>

  Yeah i get it sacred geometry wow yah know. Just drop sacred from it and you got geometry wich is pretty cool and intresting. Not to mention its interesting that maybe it is a message to people who understand and if you watched the video its alot of interesting stuff from some one with a high education with knowledge of things that is hard to understand considering they didnt have bing or telephones back then. 
 Your not dumb just think for two minutes of why it could have any significance. 
 Do you even have 50 grand? Value is based on wants and needs people may need you but do they want you versa vice? Im not gonna argue with some one over the value of my contributions to society because its priceless and if you try to give your self any sort of value more or less than some one else after thinking about it for a minute then you live in a small sad and egocentric world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The whole thing is nothing but a neat coincidence.  I read through it and the author made a <strong>fundamental</strong> mistake in his initial calculation <em>which is what he justifies the entire thing with</em>!</p>

<p>Here is why:</p>

<p>He gives a statistical evaluation of how unlikely it would be for these triangles to happen by chance given <em>random</em> points.  <strong>Here is why it is all wrong.</strong></p>

<p>Given that it is all based on <em>typed writing</em> all possible points are located on a rectilinear, even grid!  How many right triangles can you make from the above grid!?</p>

<p>This not only all but <em>guarantees</em> that right triangles will be made, but that they would very much tend to give every possible ratio!</p>

<p>Given there is a limited set of ratios possible by size contraints, the odds of a 3:4:5 triangle increase exponentially.  All three of these measurements are all but guaranteed by the common size of a page and that 3&quot;4&quot;or5&quot; would all happen on a page-sized grid of evenly spaced points on a grid in fractions of inches!</p>

<p>It is simple coincidence and reaching, every single typed page will give you these triangles with a near certainty!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Conventional wisdom has it that the Greeks were the originators of European/Western culture.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Plato studied at the Temple of Waset for 11 years; Aristotle was there for 11-13 years; Socrates 15 years Euclid stayed for 10-11 years; Pythegoras for 22 yeasrs; Hypocrates studies for 20 years.</p>

<p>But it sure does look like the Greeks got their best stuff from the Egyptians doesn&#39;t it? Names above represent philosophy, geometry, medicine etc.</p>
