        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The shilled arguments against NN are horrible and give the uninformed blanks for ammo. For example, that Google and Facebook censor so the net is not neutral. This assumes that NN is specific to websites. Instead, NN allows competition to Facebook and Google and Twitter and Reddit  ( duckduckgo, can, voat) that cannot exist without net neutrality.</p>

<p>What is being laid out is not just internet slow lanes. It&#39;s censorship and control. If &quot;left Jew media&quot; controls tv and NBC Comcast owns 50million subscribers then you&#39;re really advancing one group.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t make sense to me that so many people are against net neutrality. I am terrified of its removal and consequent censorship of subreddits like this, removal of subreddits like this, and impossible migration to another platform because an alternative will not be allowed.</p>

<p>Evidence of onspiracy: the donald censored all proNN comments, </p>

<p>bad arguments everywhere (<em>Obama&#39;s</em> net neutrality, as if Obama is even relevant), (party lines, as if the results are partisan)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know, seeing all these misinformed people being useful idiots for the big telecom companies is painful to say the very least. </p>

<p>Comcast, Verizon, AT&amp;T are not your friends, they want to strangle the Internet. </p>

<p>Seeing people here talk about Comcast like it is some sort of benevolent corporation and not a company with a well documented history of abuses against its customers is completely ridiculous.</p>

<p>The company that so many of you here are defending, Comcast, <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/comcast-wins-worst-company-in-america/">is regularly labeled one of the worst corporations in America</a> and was the worst corporation in America in 2014 according to the Consumerist. </p>

<p>Yet somehow these people want us to believe that the God-like invisible hand of the market will guide everything along swimmingly. </p>

<p>It&#39;s complete bullshit.</p>

<p>As someone who&#39;s had to deal with Comcast&#39;s bullshit for most of his adult life, I can tell you that big Telecom is not your friend. </p>

<p>While you&#39;re at it, why don&#39;t you defend Goldman Sachs and Lockheed Martin /s. </p>

<p>The last time the major battle for Net Neutrality took place in 2014, this sub was decidedly pro-Net Neutrality. With the events of the last election and influx of users here from another subreddit, all of a sudden Net Neutrality is now a controversial subject on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.</p>

<p>Talk about going backwards ... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, please do not go away.</p>

<p>Here is an example of throttling before net neutrality was put in place:

<p>I&#39;m going to edit your statement to exclude anything not relevant to an argument.</p>

<p>&quot;As for net neutrality, <del>people for government regulation seem to be forgetting that</del> the internet existed before <del>Obama tried to stick his tentacles all over it.</del>&quot;</p>

<p>Obama is not relevant. It could have been enacted by Nixon, it doesn&#39;t matter. The inclusion of obama is to trigger a negative connotative response to net neutrality.</p>

<p>Because we want NN doesn&#39;t mean we&#39;re pro regulation. I would prefer it would remain completely unregulated, but that is not possible because there is not enough competition. This is not the best possible outcome, but it is the best attainable outcome.</p>

<p>you are still not mentioning consequences of repeal. Please, are you willing to debate?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK, I will not go away.  But I am tired, and I do not feel like responding, but I feel it is my civic duty to explain this to you in case there are others listening.</p>

<p>Relative to the argument is Obama.  Obama is a progressive, progressives have continuously attacked our representative republic.  He is the latest and highest ranking figure-head of the progressive movement.  Honorable mention could go to other progressives in the recent past, like G.W. Bush, Clinton, Bush, Carter, LBJ, Nixon, FDR, and Woodrow Wilson.  But they did not force this &quot;legislation&quot; upon us, Obama urged the FCC to post some bullcrap open vote that was rife with misleading information and full of fake votes.  Why did the FCC overstep their authority to hold some sham referendum on Net Neutrality?  Because Obama knew there would be no way he could get the legislation through once people understood what it really was.</p>

<p>It never ceases to amaze me, those people that say, &quot;because we want government regulation (net neutrality) doesn&#39;t mean we&#39;re pro regulation.&quot;  What does it mean then?  It means that THIS time, on THIS issue, you are smarter than everybody else, including the founding fathers.  </p>

<p>Here is the thing, the Bill of Rights is a list of governmental limitations.  The more regulation the less liberty we enjoy.  There are exceptions, like you mentioned.  Monopolies created a need for the FTC and anti-trust legislation.  Net Neutrality is far from that. </p>

<p>Do you think Verizon customers would have continued paying for a service that openly advertised that they were throttling Netflix?  Do you think AT&amp;T customers would have continued to tolerate their throttling of Facetime?  What you are a proponent of is the government, led by lobbyists, to play arbiter in speed of service disputes.  Did you see the IRS targeting conservative groups under Obama?  Government is corruptible.  </p>

<p>The free market takes care of itself, but it has to remain free of encumbrances to do so.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>But those are specific to websites, not the entire internet. What Google does is specific to google, and getting banned there doesn&#39;t bn you from Craigslist or eBay. Those are not affected by net neutrality.</p>

<p>A better comparison is that cablecompanyX realizes you&#39;re banned from Google and doesn&#39;t allow you to use Yahoo and instead forces you to use cablecompanyXsearch, which only shows you things that make the company look good (similar to China&#39;s censored internet.)</p>

<p>Another physical comparison is that you&#39;re banned from olive garden and the toll booth operator forces you to go to his cousins restaurant and does not allow you to try Bob&#39;s burgers. Net neutrality would force the toll booth operator to allow you to travel in any direction you want. </p>

<p>A less dire example would have the toll booth operator allow you to travel in any direction but forces you to take the long way. So long that you choose not to travel it, increasing traffic to the mafia-esque controlled roads</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have to look back a few years to realize how quickly things changed. </p>

<p>Netflix is the greatest example because it was the first commercial success of lots of bandwidth. Regular people,  the crowd who only uses the internet for Facebook  (not bitcoin mining, not downloading 10GB Steam games, not torrent distributing 100GB of linux.)</p>

<p>And in 2014 Verizon and Comcast both throttled Netflix. Consumers suffered. Verizon asked Netflix for money or it would continue to throttle it. So Netflix paid, and then verizon continued to throttle. <a href="https://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/06/05/business/media/netflix-points-at-verizon-for-delays-in-streaming.html">https://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/06/05/business/media/netflix-points-at-verizon-for-delays-in-streaming.html</a></p>

<p>Comcast did the same.</p>

<p>So your first point, why didn&#39;t it happen, is loaded question. <em>it did happen.</em> and your question assumes and readers who see it assume it never did.</p>

<p>As we progress into an entirely digital future the stakes are higher. All of our phones use data. The voice you hear are data packets. The text you send is a data packet. The internet you see are data packets. And before messengers like WhatsApp there were different rates. Do you remember paying $.20 per text? Long distance calling? All of that went away with VoIP like vonage, skype, magic jack, FaceTime, etc. But if they become allowed to limit these services, the next step is for them to I produce their own (more expensive) price scheme.</p>

<p>Porn is another big one. You can expect that to get more expensive. It uses to cost a lot of money for a VHS or magazine. If they get the chance to throttle that and sell you a service, do you think they will? These are examples.</p>

<p>Will legislators work? I would believe it if they repealed net neutrality while simultaneously introducing an improved solution. But reverting to a state where ISPs retain control without any oversight I not progress. </p>
