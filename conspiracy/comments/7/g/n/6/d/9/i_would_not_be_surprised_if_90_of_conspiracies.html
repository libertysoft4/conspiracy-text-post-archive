    <div class="md"><p>Disinfo agents are not going to create a theory that nobody would believe. The best disinfo theories are the ones that sound really stupid to the average person, but are constructed well enough that it will convince a certain percentage of people. They get bonus points if the disinfo theory also divides the opposition. </p>

<p>A good example is Alex Jones. There are all actual claims or talking points about Alex Jones: Alex Jones is Bill Hicks. Alex Jones has a Jewish wife. Alex Jones works for Israel. Alex Jones is anti semitic and therefore discredits the conspiracy movement. Alex Jones works for the CIA and/or FBI, and that&#39;s why his show was never shut down. </p>

<p>Now you know why they don&#39;t have to shut Alex Jones down. Not only do they probably feed him disinfo so that he discredits himself, they have divided up Alex Jones fans and any potential fans into all of these little opposing groups who constantly fight. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know Mandela Effect sounds insane, but for a few examples people share really similar testimonies that aren&#39;t even necessarily related to memory. I believe most of the MEs I&#39;ve experienced are just the result of my own poor memories, but there are a few that I&#39;m willing to keep an open mind as to the cause.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not because of parallel dimensions, time travel, CERN or anything like that (at least I&#39;ve seen no evidence beyond a questionable understanding of quantum physics and quantum computing that it would even be possible to identify parallel dimensions let alone have control over them).</p>

<p>However, and I realise this could make me seem like an overly paranoid lunatic, but I started looking into things like &quot;optogenetics&quot;, &quot;sonogenetics&quot;, &quot;deep brain stimulation&quot; and how they relate to memory and there are lots of research papers from traditionally well-regarded academic institutions that explain how this technology can induce false memories and  create auditory and visual hallucinations with non-invasive procedures. </p>

<p>I realise it sounds far-fetched, but things like optogenetics only requires light to stimulate a section of the brain to turn specific memories on and off. Once you find the terminology that scientists use in their papers it&#39;s actually quite shocking the extent to how advanced these technologies are in terms of just the public available documents. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s that unreasonable to think that as there are no international laws or treaties that private or government research teams might be even further ahead.</p>

<p>I read a paper today that had no problem admitting through electromagnetic stimulation of the brain it was possible to create &quot;a self within a self&quot; in the right side of the brain. What that meant was that people would start to believe that a message from their own brain was somehow external to themselves and came from a god or some other mystical being. It&#39;s apparently the part of the brain that is used by religious people and they think it might have been why people believed they were hearing messages from their god. </p>

<p>Lots of papers also discuss ways of releasing info about this type of science to the public to avoid panic. The scientists also admit that it&#39;s potentially incredibly dangerous if someone were to not have any ethics and wanted to use it for nefarious ends.</p>

<p>I&#39;m on a phone so it&#39;s hard to post links. I&#39;ll edit the comment later to include them if anybody is interested. I&#39;m also not an academic so if someone who works in the field believes I&#39;ve misunderstood the research then please feel free to let me know where I&#39;m going wrong.</p>

<p>Sorry for the long comment but with the Mandela Effect there are some odd things that conventional explanations don&#39;t account for (for example various legal patents saying the Fruit of the Loom logo has the horn of plenty/cornucopia in the logo when it apparently never has. It&#39;s odd why legal documents have references to something that has never existed. So people are seeing and recollecting things that never existed and including a description of this non existent thing in a legal document that describes the logo)</p>

<p>I&#39;ll probably get downvoted heavily, but I do totally accept how insane it sounds if you haven&#39;t experienced it and I do also think that the most plausible explanation is poor memory, I&#39;m just keeping an open mind until a specific study into collective memory formation for commonly cited Mandela Effect examples is conducted.</p>

<p>I would say a lot of these less rational theories have been out there for a long time. It is possible that the CIA or someone created them 50+ years ago, but I don&#39;t think they are actively spreading them now.</p>

<p>I think there are just opportunists out there that see that they can sell a book or a DVD to some gullible people, and they produce tons of material promoting these theories and people buy it and this is how these theories survive and spread now.</p>

<p>The tactic that may be used is through the media and politicians conflating far out conspiracy theories with those that we have evidence of being real, thus discrediting proof of actual conspiracies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My theory at this point is that the modern Flat Earth Society is an attempt to &quot;make the world slightly more interesting&quot; by trying to preserve the original.</p>

<p>For example, the first Flat Earth Society was the work of a guy trying to reconcile traditional fundamentalist interpretations of the Bible. Whether or not he was serious, he never indicated that he wasn&#39;t.</p>

<p>Fast forward to 2004: Daniel Shenton (who is actually a non-Christian and understand biological evolution) discovers the now non-existent movement and decides not just to preserve and archive it on the Internet, but to preserve and archive <em>what the world was like</em> when it had someone who seemed to <em>believe</em> that Earth is flat. And so he&#39;s made a deliberate effort to make the world think that <em>he</em> believes.</p>

<p>The modern Flat Earth Society is very Discordian. Arguably, the original one might have been a leg-pull as well. Either way, I admire the dedication.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can see how it&#39;s difficult to believe a lot of the things from NASA and some things do seem like they&#39;re not being totally legit about some things that they release to the public. I personally don&#39;t think that even if you believe NASA can&#39;t be trusted that therefore means that the Earth is flat.</p>

<p>I respect the fact that people decide to research it for themselves as trying to verify something for yourself can never be a bad thing.</p>

<p>I just don&#39;t see what&#39;s the point of covering up the shape of the Earth. What would anybody gain from this? I&#39;ve seen some people say it proves the existence of God, but the Bible doesn&#39;t say the Earth is flat does it? I thought it just said &quot;four corners of the Earth&quot;. Also, didn&#39;t the ancient Greeks propose the Earth was round? I guess I&#39;m just struggling to see a motive</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hiding God is the reason.  If you consider the Biblical narrative as real for a moment.  That means there is a spiritual entity bent on lying, deception, and hates humans.  This is Lucifer who many of the elite actually worship.  He gives them real tangible power here.</p>

<p>The Bible is certainly a Flat Earth book.  It has a defined up/north (where 1st, 2nd, and 3rd heaven is) and down (hell, bottomless pit).  There are many verses that allude to a flat earth but more certainly there are verses that say we are on foundation and pillars and can&#39;t be moved.  That means so spinning ball for sure.  Also the moon is it&#39;s own light.  Notice God made two great lights, not one and then a rock to reflect it.</p>

<p>Gen 1:16  And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also. </p>

<p>Foundations:</p>

<p>Job_38:4 Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth? declare, if thou hast understanding.</p>

<p>Psa_104:5 Who laid the foundations of the earth, that it should not be removed for ever.</p>

<p>Isa_51:13 And forgettest the LORD thy maker, that hath stretched forth the heavens, and laid the foundations of the earth; and hast feared continually every day because of the fury of the oppressor, as if he were ready to destroy? and where is the fury of the oppressor?</p>

<p>Isa_51:16 And I have put my words in thy mouth, and I have covered thee in the shadow of mine hand, that I may plant the heavens, and lay the foundations of the earth, and say unto Zion, Thou art my people.</p>

<p>Jer_31:37 Thus saith the LORD; If heaven above can be measured, and the foundations of the earth searched out beneath, I will also cast off all the seed of Israel for all that they have done, saith the LORD.</p>

<p>Unmovable:</p>

<p>1Ch 16:30 Fear before him, all the earth: the world also shall be stable, that it be not moved. </p>

<p>Psa 93:1 The LORD reigneth, he is clothed with majesty; the LORD is clothed with strength, wherewith he hath girded himself: the world also is stablished, that it cannot be moved.</p>

<p>Pillars:</p>

<p>1Sa_2:8 He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, and lifteth up the beggar from the dunghill, to set them among princes, and to make them inherit the throne of glory: for the pillars of the earth are the LORD&#39;S, and he hath set the world upon them.</p>

<p>Job_9:6 Which shaketh the earth out of her place, and the pillars thereof tremble.</p>

<p>Psa_75:3 The earth and all the inhabitants thereof are dissolved: I bear up the pillars of it. Selah.</p>

<p>Basically the gist here is Satan only needs you to believe in ANYTHING other than the Gospel of Jesus Christ.  This huge lie creates agnostics, atheists, and nihilists (like I used to be).</p>

<p>All religions are man&#39;s made up way to get to heaven.  The only way is to accept what God already did for you.  He did all the work.  We are all sinners God punishes just a single sin with eternal separation in a lake of fire.   He knew we couldn&#39;t make it on our own so he came as Jesus Christ and paid the price for us.  All we need to do is repent and accept what he did and Bellevue it which is so simple.  This simplicity is what Satan is trying to hide.</p>

<p>1Co 15:1  Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; 
1Co 15:2  By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. 
1Co 15:3  For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; 
1Co 15:4  And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures: </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, thanks for replying. May I ask, did you believe in Christianity/God before you discovered flat earth? It&#39;s just anecdotal evidence, but I&#39;ve seen quite a few people say they didn&#39;t believe in God before finding out about flat earth (by believe, I don&#39;t mean just believing in the overall concept of a god, but believe in terms of seriously reading The Bible).</p>

<p>You mentioned that you think religions were made by man to deceive, do you think this is true for Christianity?</p>

<p>One final question, have you read the Gnostic Christian Nag Hammadi texts? I think that has some different ideas about the creation of the world and people. I was interested if you&#39;ve read it whether you believe it relates to flat earth too. I read the Gospel of Thomas and that is pretty much just what Jesus said. To me, it seemed closer in message and tone to something like Buddhism or the Tao Te Ching, but I&#39;m no scholar so it could be me misinterpreting it, if you haven&#39;t read it though you might find it interesting </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was pretty much a hater of all religion including Christianity.  I didn&#39;t believe in God or at least I didn&#39;t think it was possible for man to know if there was a God or not.  I would have defined myself as an Agnostic/Nihilist.</p>

<p>I started to wonder about God when I researched things like Spirit Cooking and wondered why Freemasons and others in high power seemed to be doing rituals and many worshiped the &quot;light bearer&quot; (which is what Lucifer means).  I was thinking &quot;chicken or egg&quot; do people drink blood and do weird ritual because they are rich and powerful and just get bored or do people do this stuff to get rich and powerful.</p>

<p>Once I got to Flat Earth/Fake Space I basically became a Gnostic.  I believed in God but didn&#39;t know what one was correct.  I did do a lot of investigation (as well as some praying to this unknown God) and ended up concluding Jesus Christ was the truth.  I don&#39;t know if I was led spiritually to that (I think so.. &quot;seek and ye shall find&quot;) or what but once I repented and believed the gospel my life supernaturally changed.  The experience of being &quot;born again&#39; is the most most profound evidence that anyone could have.  I was then led to the King James Bible and now I study it and try to get people saved who will hear.</p>

<p>I do think the many forms of organized Christianity are meant to deceive.  It includes the Catholic Church, Mormons, 7th day Adventists, Jehovah&#39;s witness, etc.  The closest thing to Biblical Christianity is found in Baptist circles but even they are compromised much of the time and fall victim to &quot;hyper grace&quot; which is removing repentance.  The only truth is found in reading the KJV with the Holy Spirit as your teacher.  As soon as people start following a man they get led astray.  Pretty much any Christian you know form TV or media is a false teacher.  They all pervert the truth.</p>

<p>So basically I believe what the KJV Bible says and noting that man teaches.  Which is that humans are in a cursed/fallen state due to sin.  We all deserve the lake of fire (we can&#39;t comprehend God&#39;s holiness) but since God knew we couldn&#39;t meet the requirements to avoid it ourselves (be sinless) he gave us Jesus Christ (the final blood sacrifice, &quot;The Lamb of God&quot;) who is God manifest in the flesh who lived a perfect sinless life and paid the price for us in full.  He did all the work and salvation is by faith in him and his gospel alone which spiritually washes away our sins with his blood.  It is nothing that we do ourselves.  We simply need to repent and believe the Gospel which is:</p>

<p>1Co 14:1  Follow after charity, and desire spiritual gifts, but rather that ye may prophesy. 
1Co 14:2  For he that speaketh in an unknown tongue speaketh not unto men, but unto God: for no man understandeth him; howbeit in the spirit he speaketh mysteries. 
1Co 14:3  But he that prophesieth speaketh unto men to edification, and exhortation, and comfort. 
1Co 14:4  He that speaketh in an unknown tongue edifieth himself; but he that prophesieth edifieth the church.</p>

<p>I have looked a a bunch of those Gnostic texts.  They all come from Babylon and are meant to lead people away from the simple truth of grace by faith alone.  </p>

<p>2Co 11:3  But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ. </p>

<p>Everything is so simple but people don&#39;t want it to be because they want to be good and righteous themselves.  They want to think they are better than somebody else.  We are all just sinners in need of redemption.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting, thanks for that. I definitely think the flat Earth idea is being promoted by someone or something (by something I mean YouTube algorithms).</p>

<p>The FE stuff seemed to pop up almost overnight from my perspective. I&#39;ve been reading various conspiracy related sites since about 06 and never came across people seriously arguing for FE. It seemed that the summer of 2016 all of a sudden conspiracy sites and YouTube in particular were full of FE believers. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you think it might be related to NASA as they seem to have released some questionable footage in the past? Just wondering if it&#39;s NASA money paying to promote it as if the average person sees a flat earth believer breakdown why certain NASA stuff is suspicious then most people will just ignore it if it&#39;s then associated with flat earth.</p>

<p>NASA astronauts are also heavily suggesting that they&#39;ve seen aliens and UFOs. I wondered why, then I realised that the only way for them to get bigger budgets is to say &quot;we need more money to find out about aliens&quot;. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As an example, the 20th century saw a massive widening of the Overton Window surrounding art and peoples&#39; conception of it. Early modern artists experimented with the very idea of what <em>is</em> art and what <em>can be</em> art, and as a result the boundaries of what society was willing to consider expanded considerably. This was all by the free choices of the individuals involved. Older people tended to be hostile to modern art because their personal Overton Windows were rather ossified and inflexible. Younger people not so much.</p>

<p>Nowadays, there&#39;s yet another backlash to modern art on the part of the alt right, neoreactionary, and neofascist movements. All of them wish to use the State to artifically re-constrain the Overton Window surrounding art, in order to drive out &quot;degeneracy&quot; from our culture.</p>

<p>I think this only covers one side of the equation. Media organizations care about advertising revenue, which depends on both viewer numbers and advertiser spending. Under this model, you can only go so far to the edges of the Overton window without alienating advertisers. </p>

<p>There&#39;s also the idea of access journalism, where journalists can&#39;t push certain ideas too far without risking their organizations losing access to key sources such as politicians, which would also lead to a drop in advertising revenue. </p>

The majority of the pizzagate movement is pushed by disinfo agents or people who were fooled by those agents. Why else would so many people put all of this effort into pizzagate when we have actual evidence, proof, convictions, and testimony? It&#39;s because pizzagate discredits all of the other evidence.

The best disinfo theories are ones that sound really stupid to the average person, but are constructed well enough that it will convince a certain percentage of the public.

<p>Joe Biden was outed as a creep years ago. I remember those video compilations of him being creepy with little kids years ago. The Franklin coverup was years ago. Etc. Pizzagate has not helped this at all. If you want to discuss this kind of thing now, you are likely to be called a pizzagater. That is what immediately comes to mind when people hear this information. It&#39;s an automatic discrediting mechanism built into their mind. All they care about is the normal, persuadable 9 to 5 average Joes. It doesn&#39;t matter if some Trump supporters on 4chan discuss Biden along with Pizzagate. Pizzagaters are not influential except to their own group. Check out <a href="/r/the_donald">/r/the_donald</a> sometime. They are just as easily led as anyone else. They are just as easily disinfoed, distracted, diverted, etc. </p>

<p>You say that &quot;no Pizzagater&quot; posts those links, but I have had quite a few arguments in which legitimate scandals were referenced to make the fake one seem more legitimate.

    <div class="md"><p>It really disturbing. I don&#39;t browse r/conspiracy to troll, but I know given any event, someone has some lunatic fringe theory about it that usually falls apart with the smallest critical analysis. As soon as you disagree with &quot;what&#39;s so obvious&quot; (but not at all obvious) you get called a shill or someone says something stupid and racist about Jews, etc. It&#39;s as thought that&#39;s the only way some people know how to react to having their beliefs challenged. </p>

<p>It&#39;s genuinely appalling how ignorant a lot of the posts in this subreddit are.  What&#39;s worse is I do believe a lot of people genuinely are trying to be open minded and are looking for answers because they know they are in a fucked up world, but the basic critical thinking skills aren&#39;t there. Do conspiracy theories attract ignorant/paranoid people, or is the education system really that bad in a lot of place? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, from time to time, against my better inclinations, I respond to conspiracies that lack evidence. Usually I get called a shill (aspartame, John McCain leg brace) or something nonsensical, like goy and Ahmed (?) (for engaging with blatant anti-Semitic holocaust deniers) which is funny because nobody is paying me to do so (I wish), and I&#39;m in academia because I&#39;m interested in the truth (note: someone will see this as evidence that I&#39;ve been indoctrinated, which is because there&#39;s a strong anti-intellectual current). See the anti-vac sitcky at the top of this forum, where the antivaxxers repeatedly reject science when it&#39;s convenient and accept it when it fits what they want to hear and is from a fringe alternative source..</p>

<p>I can&#39;t tell if most comments don&#39;t care about the truth or the posters don&#39;t know how to analyze primary and secondary sources. If someone today came in here and said &quot;my dog is being controlled by directed energy weapons to attack targets&quot;, and offered <em>no</em> proof beyond that, there&#39;d be twenty upvotes and five comments saying &quot;sounds right&quot; and agreeing with it and struggling to determine if that&#39;s the result of demonic possession or government agents who do all this stuff and people are apparently aware of but nobody can ever actually pin down.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Blindly believing in something is obviously not helpful, but there are plenty of people who are guilty of blindly disbelieving in something too. There&#39;s just as many people who reject evidence of cover-ups and conspiracies as they consider themselves to be above falling for something. The idea of Mafia was considered as being a ludicrous conspiracy at one point, the same as CIA bringing crack to black inner city communities.</p>

<p>There was a BBC show a while ago called &quot;conspiracy&quot; who said it was probably the Iraqi government who killed Dr. David Kelly for talking  to the press to say that the claim that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction was a lie. So, the guy who said that he&#39;d be found dead in the woods (which he was eventually) was likely committed  by the Iraqi government? So according to the mainstream media he wasn&#39;t killed by someone from the US or UK after he exposed them, but by the state he said didn&#39;t have what they were accused of having?</p>

<p>There&#39;s all sorts of things that people who tend to believe or not believe in conspiracy theories ignore or believe depending on if it fits their narrative or not. It&#39;s just not accurate to portray one side as being reasonable and the other as unreasonable. Everything is case by case, of course there are some people who believe in things with little or no evidence, but there&#39;s also people who will not believe something is true unless its written about in the mainstream media or else explain something away because it&#39;s easier to dismiss everything away if it&#39;s labelled as a &quot;conspiracy theory&quot;. </p>

<p>People mock those who talk about things like chemtrails and I was dismissive at first, but there&#39;s lots of research papers about &quot;solar radiation management&quot; where it states one of the aims is to artificially block the sun as they believe it will prevent further global warming. That&#39;s from places like The Royal Society, but I&#39;ve shown the exact passages where they talk about the process to some people and they still refuse to accept it as once they regard it as something that the people they consider their intellectual inferiors believe they shut-off critical thinking in the same frustrating way that some conspiracy theorists will shutdown and and resort to calling people shills for having a different opinion to them.</p>

<p>Regarding what you call directed energy weapons, again there&#39;s research papers that discuss in detail how it&#39;s possible to create auditory and visual hallucinations via various brain stimulation methods. Personally, I haven&#39;t read anything that suggests this can necessarily happen outside a lab, but if there&#39;s a way to manipulate minds to that extent and it&#39;s available to read then it&#39;s not that much of a stretch to say there might be groups who are further ahead who work at private companies that haven&#39;t publicly published their findings.</p>

<p>I find it strange that many people will dismiss the idea that families who have had money and power for hundreds of years wouldn&#39;t want to make sure that they and their future generations want to remain on top and would use their wealth and influence to ensure that happens. There&#39;s a book by Niall Ferguson (I think he teaches at Harvard) about the Rothschild family where the source of their original wealth is traced back to around 1760, so that&#39;s around 250 years of maintaining wealth and obviously there are wealthy families that can trace back even further. It just seems crazier to believe that the elite wouldn&#39;t try to manipulate world events in order to stay as the elite. Obviously, the extent of the influence of these generational bloodlines can be debated, but there&#39;s just as many that instantly reject the idea as there are who claim they&#39;re taking their orders from Satan.</p>

<p>The anti-Semitic label is also interesting as when you Google Rothschild family history, it prominently says in the results that they are subject to &quot;anti-Semitic&quot; conspiracy theories. It&#39;s a label that most people think &quot;oh they believe these conspiracy theories because they&#39;re racist, I won&#39;t look into it then. </p>

<p>The reason Israel exists is because a Rothschild convinced the British to grant them the land with the Balfour Declaration so I would say being a key reason for the creation of a country shouldn&#39;t be overlooked because people will claim the reason for people being concerned about their influence is because they must hate Jewish people.</p>

<p>That&#39;s not to say there aren&#39;t a decent sized number of conspiracy theorists who really do believe they all the problems in the world are because of the Jews, but the &quot;anti-Semitic&quot; label is often used to silence criticism. I&#39;m not going to defend people who are holocaust deniers but, in my opinion, the fact that someone can be jailed for stating that they don&#39;t believe that it happened even if they provide what they believe to be legitimate evidence makes it easy for real racists to point to this and say &quot;see we are jailed for not believing in the Holocaust as this is forbidden knowledge. They want to stop us looking into it as they&#39;re scared we&#39;ll show that it was s lie.</p>

<p>I do agree that people can jump to conclusions and then stubbornly refuse to change their mind even when confronted with evidence. I just don&#39;t believe that&#39;s limited to people who might believe in conspiracy theories. </p>

<p>I do think it&#39;s a bit unfair to say the forum spreads lies or targets vulnerable people. Again, everything is on case-by-case. There&#39;s some good posts here and some bad. That&#39;s the same as any other sub or forum. I&#39;m also not sure how it preys on mentally unstable people. It&#39;s down to the individual what they believe, I haven&#39;t seen much evidence of people here trying to manipulate vulnerable people to get money or something like that. Many of the main subs are more guilty of trying to manipulate people into supporting policies, brands and political candidates where they&#39;ll also be expected to hand over money at some point.</p>

<p>I just think that many of your problems with conspiracy theorists are problems that can be applied to human beings in general. </p>

<p>Sorry for the long comment, I just wanted to try and provide some evidence (or at least a justification) as to why I think some of your points are a bit of a generalisation. It could be I&#39;m seeing the positive aspects here and you see the negative based on our own biases though, but I don&#39;t think this sub is necessarily any worse than any other</p>

However, looking for a conspiracy behind the abundance of stupid conspiracy theories is needless. By the nature of things, conspiracy theories attract people who fell behind in life, who have actual mental problems, who need a mega explanation as to why they&#39;ve failed etc.

<p>For example, there are many theories posted on this sub that are patently absurd with even the smallest investigation. People quote things out of context on purpose, leave out important information, and simply state things that are patently false. Yet these theories continue to gain ground--not because someone is pushing them from behind the scenes, but because people here and in other forums continue to believe in them because they want to believe in them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, but how do you decide which are real and which are created for this purpose?</p>

<p>What most people do when they are confronted with a new idea is compare it to their existing world view, see if it can fit within that understanding, then assign a plausibility to it.  &quot;I could see that being true&quot; or &quot;No, that&#39;s crazy&quot;, etc.  Note that this process has nothing to do with evaluating any specific evidence for the idea, it races past the evidence to see the conclusion, then performs the check against that conclusion.</p>

<p>Most people who frequent this sub also use this process, but have a world view which can accommodate a different range of ideas.  But they are still using this shortcutting process to judge the idea without really considering the points of evidence themselves.</p>

<p>Take a look at the criticism of Flat Earth.  Very little of it gets into the details of the alternate model being presented to expose the problems.  You get the same effect of group think in this sub where any criticism will be applauded including just calling it &quot;nonsense&quot; or calling adherents to the idea stupid.  These are not logical arguments.</p>

<p>But we can do better than this.  You can get into the details of the idea and find the contradictions which disprove it.  The Flat Earth model, for example, has specific problems that can be discussed such as:<br/>
(i) The circular path of the sun around the North pole proposed by the model cannot accommodate Southern &#39;hemisphere&#39; longest day lengths without parts of the North having 24hr daylight
(ii)  The observed direction of star trails in the South<br/>
(iii) The practical travel distances in the far South are too long.   </p>

<p>Another shortcut that is often used is the &quot;who do I trust&quot; game.  A person who feels unequipped to evaluate ideas themselves looks for a person they think they can trust.  This is another logical failing.</p>

<p>These shortcuts for evaluating ideas have value since it is impractical to consider the details of everything, but if you really want to know about a particular subject you must get into the details of that subject.  If we use these shortcuts we are susceptible to Weltanschauungskrieg or &quot;World View Warfare&quot; (<a href="https://www.globalresearch.ca/articles/SIM311A.html">https://www.globalresearch.ca/articles/SIM311A.html</a>) and the &quot;Opinion Makers&quot;(for the who do I trust shortcut) described by Bernays. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>had a history teacher at school tell a story about east germany, went something like this, </p>

<p>A teacher at one of the university was a bit of a loud voice with criticism of the state, the secret police knew what he was doing and saying, so they would let the tyres down on his bike...lived in a large office complex block thing.. this meant he would go into the uni shouting about how the government was letting the air out of his bike tyres. If you get somebody shouting the government are deflating my tyres, you might think they are maybe not worth listening to about other stuff. </p>

<p>Anyway always thought it was quite a good story, also feel a little sorry for the Stasi agent who might have looked forward to james bond type stuff and ended up letting a tyre on a push bike down several times a month.....(i dont have any other sympathy for the Stasi, other than that little bit above..... really want to make that clear!) </p>

<p>But was probably a good way of hiding the truth, make the guy sound like a nutter </p>

<p>It&#39;s still really small, but the goal is to focus on highly plausible conspiracies so they don&#39;t get crowded out by stuff about flat earth and lizard people</p>

    <div class="md"><p>75% of the content here pre-election was 9/11 based, with no new leads or insights. Anyone who called that into question was downvoted. Coincidentally, as soon as political conspiracy blew up, that group got upset and started calling for a ban on political conspiracy (as if 9/11 and everything else aren&#39;t also completely political). So yeah, we have shills. It&#39;s a plague on both our houses.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No one is interested in real conspiracies. The CIA has funded so many third world assassinations, coups, and rigged elections in the third world since the mid 20th century. It&#39;s been reported but since Americans are ignorant about the rest of the world, or worse yet just hostile, nothing ever happens.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not the &quot;controlled media&quot; it&#39;s joe citizens level of stupidity that allows it to continue. People should have freaked at the Iraq invasion under such obvious bullshit justifications, but people are ignorant and happy to remain so.  </p>

<p>You can&#39;t even do anything about crooked violent cops because all the white racists are happy to see it. If you say anything you are a faggot liberal SJW. People cheer on violence of the state. When a G-20 meeting happened in my city my facebook feed was full of people cheering on the police. Good luck changing anything</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I had a fun moment where I had listened to Alan Watt the day before. Back before 2006 or something he had some interesting things to say and he mentioned how media material on conspiracies is created to look authentic at the beginning and then fade to being ridiculous to steer people off way among other things. This could be on topics or just in a general sense.</p>

<p>Anyway my friend had been watching Jesse Venturas show and described the process step by step from his experience off it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The CIA is notorious for running DisInformation campaigns.  The British people, at least, had a debate whether past Prime Minister Tony Blair should be tried and jailed for participating in the U.S.-led Iraq War in which millions died, but that topic on CIAstream media (deceptively referred to as &quot;mainstream&quot; media) is off limits, expressly verbotten, way outside the CIA-approved Overton Window, so you don&#39;t see pundits on CNN, NBC, etc. making even a peep or squeak about whether Bush should be tried by the Justice Department.  And if someone did bring up the topic, s/he probably wouldn&#39;t be invited back to the &quot;news&quot; show.</p>
