        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>During the summer, Europes biggest budget airline Ryanair announced thousands of flights being cancelled or postponed. The reason given at the time was an internal error where all of the pilots were allowed to take overlapping holidays producing a staff shortage during their busiest time of year. Some people also mentioned Ryanair had lost pilots to a rival airline during the year, but somehow a massive company couldn&#39;t foresee this major problem before it happened. </p>

<p>This week in the US, at another extremely busy time of year American Airlines puts out a similar sob story, that a glitch in their HR system allowed overlapping holidays or in some cases additional holidays to be booked by flight crew and there&#39;s nothing they can do except cancel flights. </p>

<p>Call me cynical, but when I see a pattern, I get concerned. There&#39;s something bigger going on here. Anyone want to join me on this?</p>

Why wouldn&#39;t they just say if that was the case, people might be annoyed, but would be less annoyed than some glitch cancelling flights and it would make companies look good if they were taking a hit in profit in order to produce fewer contrails in order to help combat the unnatural warming they cause?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My father was a delta pilot, he actually just retired after 33 years.  But he worked every holiday for 23 years, starting in 1984.  We moved christmas so he could work.  The company doesnt shut down because too many people ask for time off.</p>

<p>In addition to this.  Pilots fly to other cities to pilot airplanes.  My father lived in FL and was based in Detroit and at one point Alaska.  He had to commute everytime he was called in.  </p>

<p>There are more than enough pilots out there to fly.</p>
