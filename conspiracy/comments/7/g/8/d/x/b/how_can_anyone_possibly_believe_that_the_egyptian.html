Using any iota of logical thinking, a conclusion can be made very easily that what we&#39;re taught is total BS.

    <div class="md"><p>Breaking down the math, the Egyptians would have needed to place 240 blocks weighing 2.5 tons each ever hour over the course of 20 years with 100,000 workers. That isn’t even considering that it would’ve been impossible for them to cut these massive stone blocks out of the quarries using only stone tools and then moving them from the quarry to the site without wheels which weren’t invented yet.</p>

<p>There&#39;s also zero proof that the ancient Egyptians, as we know them, even built the pyramids. There&#39;s also no proof that they were built to be used as a tomb. The Sphinx also has undeniable evidence of water erosion, which should be impossible. There wasn’t enough rain in the area unless you go back to 6000BC or later.</p>

<p>Other absurd facts:
* The great Pyramid is the center of the landmasses of Earth.
* Its latitude is 29.9792458. The speed of light is 299,792,458m/s.
* The northern face is perfectly aligned to true north. The eastern face to true east, south to south, west to west. The accuracy is within a fraction of a degree (we likely couldn’t accomplish this today)
* It’s perfect aligned with Orion&#39;s belt (you’d need to know our position in the universe, which the Egyptians did not)
* The pyramids are actually the Earths true prime meridian.
* Could keep going.. there&#39;s so much going on with the pyramids. Not to mention the fact that they&#39;re coincidentally located all across the globe.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some of these claims are pretty dubious. <a href="http://www.academia.edu/4035001/How_the_Pyramid_Builders_May_Have_Found_Their_True_North">Here&#39;s</a> a practical report of someone achieving similar accuracy with simple tools; as it points out, and simple research confirms, the pyramids are not &quot;perfectly&quot; aligned with true north. The accuracy may be impressive, but it&#39;s nothing that you couldn&#39;t achieve with ropes and gnomons and there&#39;s absolutely no reason we&#39;d have trouble accomplishing it today. </p>

<p>The pyramid is at 29.979 latitude; you could tack <em>any</em> four digits to the end of that figure and still get the pyramid. So claiming that it perfectly matches the speed of light is quite deceptive. Especially since the location doesn&#39;t seem to match the center of the pyramid, just a random spot in its footprint.</p>

<p>How do you figure the pyramid is &quot;the center of the landmasses of earth&quot;? Or that they&#39;re the Earth&#39;s &quot;true prime meridian&quot;?</p>

<p>A lot of these seem like anomaly hunting, tbh.</p>

<p>Similarly, why would we think that the pyramids are the center of landmasses on the Earth? </p>

<p><a href="http://www.math.nus.edu.sg/aslaksen/gem-projects/hm/0102-1-pyramids/page1002.htm">The Great Pyramid&#39;s north-south axis is aligned to within three-sixtieths of a degree of true north-south. It would be worthwhile to note that this alignment is more accurate than that of the Meridian Building at the Greenwich Observatory in London, which deviates from true north by nine-sixtieths of a degree. Even though there is no evidence in ancient texts that the Egyptians used astronomical knowledge in the construction of the pyramids, it seemed possible that they did indeed possess such knowledge, and had used it in finding the true north.</a></p>

<p>That&#39;s a fair point, still a crazy coincidence to have the first 5 digits be exactly alike</p>

<p>A single Lithuanian built a castle out of stone he quarried himself in Florida. An empire that dominated Egypt, at the time one of the most advanced regions on the planet, would surely have no issue summoning the manpower and resources for such an endeavor. Use of the wheel was not necessary: sleds placed over logs or wet sand were probably used.</p>

<p>U wot? <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diary_of_Merer">There is literally a direct source,</a> from someone who <em>built</em> the Pyramids. It was discovered in eastern Egypt and dates back to the 26th century BCE.</p>

<p>Except for the existence of funerary artifacts, right? Unless you mean to say that the bodies there were fake. In which case, I ask for evidence.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Many historians believe the sphinx is significantly older than was initially believed, potentially from 5000BCE or later. But, as you yourself admitted, rainfall over time was the likely cause of the erosion.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographical_centre_of_Earth">That&#39;s up for debate.</a> It could also be in Turkey. Regardless, as is mentioned in that link, the Egyptians at the time would not have had the knowledge to &quot;map&quot; the surface of the earth such that they would find the center of the landmasses, so the point is moot.</p>

<p>20 years are 7,300 days. 240 2.5 ton blocks are 600 tons per hour.</p>

<p>The pyramid has a mass of ~5 million tons.</p>

<p>5E6 ton / 600 tons per hour = 8,333 hours</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Egypt wasn&#39;t a primitive place at the time.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Bronze_Age_collapse">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Bronze_Age_collapse</a></p>

<p>Contrary to popular belief that the further back you go in time the more primitive it becomes, there was a near-extinction event that wiped out most of the cities and technology of the Eastern Mediterranean Sea. So Egypt wasn&#39;t a bunch of Barbarians, but a fully-fledged civilization that depended on international trade to keep power, and to spread the weight of the &#39;Sea Peoples&#39; who were attacking. Egypt lasted the longest, but was ultimately brought down by the same collapse that brought down the others in the area.</p>

<p>But previously these guys had a Military caste, warriors who trained for a lifetime to master chariot warfare, Scribes who were their accountants/historians and stuff that took a bit to learn, builders and a complex religion. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know for sure how Egypt made the Pyramids, but since they were more advanced than the peoples who came after them, I do not think it too far fetched, and I think calling them primitive is wrong. Especially the stone tools part, Egyptians had Bronze working at the time, which is harder than Iron.</p>

<p>Most people think, cause of video games, that Iron is better than Bronze. It&#39;s not, it&#39;s just more readily available. Bronze takes two metals and alloys them, Iron is just one, and comparatively simple. So Iron is better in terms of mass production because you don&#39;t have a material bottleneck (which is why the Iron Age can also support more people/tech/civ since it&#39;s easier and faster to make). </p>

<p>I&#39;m rambling, but Egypt wasn&#39;t primitive, they didn&#39;t always use stone tools, and if you got a better theory publish it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that primitive is an unfair representation of ancient Egypt. And yes they had access to bronze and copper, but stone tools were predominantly in use at the time. I&#39;m definitely guilty of going for more of a clickbait title. But that&#39;s besides the point in my opinion. Even if the Egyptians were more advanced than a primitive people and had access to bronze, it doesn&#39;t explain everything I laid out in another comment I already made: </p>

<p>Breaking down the math, the Egyptians would have needed to place 240 blocks weighing 2.5 tons every hour over the course of 20 years with 100,000 workers. That isn’t even considering that it would’ve been impossible for them to cut these massive stone blocks out of the quarries using only stone tools and then moving them from the quarry to the site without wheels which weren’t invented yet.</p>

<p>There&#39;s also zero proof that the ancient Egyptians, as we know them, even built the pyramids. There&#39;s also no proof that they were built to be used as a tomb. The Sphinx also has undeniable evidence of water erosion, which should be impossible. There wasn’t enough rain in the area unless you go back to 6000BC or later.</p>

<p>Other absurd facts:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The great Pyramid is the center of the landmasses of Earth.</p></li>
<li><p>Its latitude is 29.9792458. The speed of light is 299,792,458m/s.</p></li>
<li><p>The northern face is perfectly aligned to true north. The eastern face to true east, south to south, west to west. The accuracy is within a fraction of a degree (we likely couldn’t accomplish this today)</p></li>
<li><p>It’s perfect aligned with Orion&#39;s belt (you’d need to know our position in the universe, which the Egyptians did not)</p></li>
<li><p>The pyramids are actually the Earths true prime meridian.</p></li>
<li><p>Could keep going.. there&#39;s so much going on with the pyramids. Not to mention the fact that they&#39;re coincidentally located all across the globe.</p></li>

<p>Pyramid building was a socio-economic enterprise, more focused on employment-based loyalty than motivated by religious ideology.</p>

<p>You know that even today Construction workers have the highest job satisfaction? It&#39;s cause they drive past the building hey worked on every day, they can point to it and say &quot;yeah, I built that&quot;. The Pyramids (according to the link) may not have been just for a tomb, but as a team-building exercise on a monumental (*ahem<em>) scale that served to create a national identity that the Pharohs could exploit. *</em>&quot;We&#39;re Egyptians!&quot;** he&#39;d say <strong>&quot;Let&#39;s go get those Nubians!&quot;</strong>, and he could expect the people to support his efforts, since weren&#39;t they all Egyptians? Didn&#39;t everyone contribute to the ginormous Pyramid, can&#39;t miss it? </p>

<p>As for the math of moving tons of rock, gotta shrug. Why is it perfectly aligned with the north? Maybe a compass, the BACollapse did lose a bunch of technology, maybe the compass was invented then, but it was top secret (since holy shit a compass) and kept by the Religious/Royal faction. </p>

<p>But the Prime Meridian thing, uhhh.... what do you think the Prime Meridian does? Cause any line can be the Prime Meridian, it&#39;s just where we start counting from, there&#39;s nothing inherently special about it? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your logic is flawed.  We have pyramids all over the globe.  Are they all “clearly” tombs?  Thats not what scientists say.  They say some are tombs, some are temples, some are palaces.  Really, they say whatever is required to fit the structure into the context of where it is found.  If you think about it, pyramids are one of the most versatile things on earth because they can apparently be just about anything an archeologist says they are with minimal to no supporting evidence to back it up!</p>

<p>So they went to all the trouble to build the great pyramid as a tomb, but then just forgot to put the dead pharaoh inside?  Or maybe they just...  changed their minds?</p>

<p>Would be kind of like building the Hoover dam but then just not ever connecting it to the power grid.  That would obviously be an inconceivable waste of time and energy, and were that the case it would be illogical to conclude it is a hydroelectric dam and one SHOULD search for an alternate explanation.</p>

<p>Comparing the great pyramid to a scabbard is apples to oranges.  It is comparing something for which the purpose is clearly evident, to something which the purpose is historically mysterious.  Despite the fact that they have sat in the same place for millennia, academics from the ancient Greeks to modern day do not agree on what the pyramids were built for.  Your iron-clad acceptance of a completely unproven theory should be reconsidered.</p>

<p>It might be mysterious to you. But when taking all the evidence into account the purpose of the great pyramid is just as clearly evident as the scabbard.</p>

<p>Just because people are ignorant of the evidence doesn&#39;t make it a mystery. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am convinced that Hancock and Carlson more or less have it correct.  There must have been an ancient advanced civilization on earth which predates what we currently believe to be the earliest organized civilizations.  Then a global cataclysm wiped them out almost completely, as well as destroyed most of the evidence of their existence.</p>

<p>A small minority must have survived and retained some of the knowledge of their former civilization.  These survivors either went on to repopulate the earth over time with the human race as we now know it, or they combined with more &quot;primitive&quot; hunter/gatherer tribes of homo sapiens and shared their knowledge with them.  The end result is the otherwise unexplained sudden jump in ability where humans appear to have gone from hunter/gatherers living in primitive shelters and caves, to suddenly constructing monolithic and megalithic structures all around the globe while demonstrating mind-blowing knowledge of astronomy, mathematics, geometry etc.</p>

<p>The current paradigm sees no problem with accepting that people went from living in caves to constructing Gobekli Tepe in an extremely short period of time.</p>

<p>Your argument is this: They lived in caves. Some people live in caves today because they make for good shelter. This means they must&#39;ve been fairly advanced, since they utilized the same shelter as some modern humans. Therefore, it&#39;s clear that they were indeed capable of constructing Gobekli Tepe.

    <div class="md"><p>Provide a single example of a “very advanced” human society that lives in caves.  By what metric are they “very advanced”.  Is there a cave dwelling civilization that also mastered nuclear fusion?  That I would be interested in hearing about.  The usual sequence of events when humans make technological advances is that one of the very first things they do is establish safer, more comfortable, and more protected shelters.  I.e. they build homes.  The mere fact that a society is living in a cave more-or-less indicates that they are not at all “advanced”.  </p>

<p>It doesn’t mean they are stupid or inferior.  It DOES mean they have made minimal technological advancements.  And remember basically the entire history of scientific advancement is a stepwise process of people learning from and building on the knowledge and discoveries (and failures) of their predecessors.  Very few technological or scientific innovations occur in a vacuum, there is almost always a long series of prior discoveries leading up to the breakthrough.  So either prehistoric humans were sitting caves deriving mathematical constants and perfecting the physics of moving megalithic blocks in a theoretical sense for millennia and then one day just up and decided to go build a pyramid...  Or, there is a major missing piece of history evident here.  I believe much of this knowledge had to have been taught to them in around the period that we suddenly see such an unexplained explosion of technological ability. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is such a non-explanation though.  The dogma is that humans evolved from hunter/gatherer tribes, to more organized civilizations gradually and it happened some time around the time of the Sumerians or other Mesopotamian societies.  This corresponded to the advent of agriculture, as this was necessary to feed a growing population and allow for “specialization” of people within that society to do other non-hunting/gathering activities (building massive stone structures, for example...).</p>

<p>The problem with a site like Gobekli Tepe is that it completely doesn’t make any sense in this traditional dogma.  It would suggest that humans went from living in caves with essentially no technology whatsoever to suddenly able to construct megalithic carved stone structures with precise geometric and astrological orientation in just a few generations or less.</p>

<p>To suggest that a modern day cave dwelling human could do something like this without there being some intervention of some sorts is absurd, frankly.  Sure, cave dwelling humans may have the mental capacity to achieve such things.  I believe the certainly do.  It is more the execution of such things that is unexplained.</p>

<p>Could you take a cave dwelling human of present day out of the jungle and teach them to build an airplane?  Sure.  Absolutely you could.  But the key thing is TEACH THEM.  To suggest a modern cave dwelling human might just spontaneously create a functional airplane completely unassisted is preposterous.  Obviously.  A site like Gobekli Tepe is an ancient example of this.  You propose there is nothing extraordinary about the accepted story that humans went from living caves, to suddenly constructing megalithic structures that even with modern technology we would have a hard time accomplishing.  It is not about their CAPACITY to do it.  It is about HOW did they actually do it.  That is something nobody seems to have an explanation for.</p>

<p>In my opinion, the most obvious explanation is that the knowledge was already there, and they were given it by a preexisting civilization.  This also helps understand why agriculture seems to have just spontaneously developed independently around the globe in different hunter/gatherer tribes that had no contact with one another, all around the same time in history.  The middle east, mesoamerica, china, etc all seem to have coincidentally  discovered agriculture right around the same time in history.  Highly coincidental, unless perhaps they were taught this by a preexisting civilization that already knew about it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;I can&#39;t figure out or inform myself how it could have been done with bronze age tools.</p>

<p>So I conclude that it is impossible to do with said tools and it must have been aliens or an advanced civilization that conspirators want to hide from us.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>About 5000 years ago the night skies were very clear and the stars in a slightly different position. The southern cross was visible in the northern hemisphere for example. It&#39;s most likely that science, measurement, navigation and religious ceremonies were derived from astronomy. To some extent they still are.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s actually fairly simple with levers and pulleys. A pulley can lift many times the force applied. The only caveat is length of the pull. They&#39;d have to be hundreds of feet tall with hemp and reed ropes thousands of feet long.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s literally only a theory. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Rawash">The Pyramid of Djedefre Abu Rawash</a> is an &#39;open pyramid&#39; located up on top of a mountain. It debunks the theory. How would they get the stones up the mountain? There&#39;s also so much evidence of machine tooling.</p>
