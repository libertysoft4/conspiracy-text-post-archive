<p>Right now many of the individual U.S. state subreddits are featuring profiles of naughty senators that are siding with big telecoms against NN. That in itself isn&#39;t necessarily bad, but they all miraculously springboarded to the frontpages other their respective subs, and ultimately r/all. On top of it, most of these podunk subs that have maybe 1k subscribers are all flooded with exponentially more &quot;current readers&quot; right now blasting the posts up the ranks.</p>

<p>Look, the point is that this is an obvious vote manipulation astroturf campaign for something that I personally believe to be a good cause...but still vote rigging and astroturf all the same. If we want to shriek and scream about groups and ideologies that use the same tactics for their causes, then we too must be intellectually honest and call this shit for what it is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For these types of companies, whether they&#39;re a &quot;monopoly&quot; depends on what you&#39;re defining the market as.  Legally, to be considered to have monopoly power a company must have at the very least 30% of the market, and usually closer to 50%.  Google has about 75% share of the search engine market, which is unquestionably monopoly power.  Whether Twitter or Facebook have monopoly power depends a bit on what you&#39;re saying the market is.

    <div class="md"><p>Legally it would have to be proved that the market dominance has lead to unfair pricing.  How much did you guys pay for Facebook and Twitter service again?  Oh that&#39;s right you&#39;re not the even the customers.  Just penned up sheep to be sold to the real customers, advertisers, who have no shortage of other platforms to choose from.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, you&#39;re a bit off.  There&#39;s two types of Sherman Act claims, referred to as Section 1 claims (anticompetitive agreements) and Section 2 (monopolization).  The elements of the first is an agreement that unreasonably constrains trade, and affects interstate commerce.  That does not depend on monopoly power.  The elements of the second are a company that holds monopoly power, and has used unlawful means to acquire or maintain that power.  </p>

<p>The impact on prices is important to assessing damages, but it&#39;s a violation to improperly create a monopoly regardless of a showing that the monopoly has negatively impacted prices.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>good idea. I searched on the wayback machine and after a few tries I found this: <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20171201130112/reddit.com/r/all/">http://web.archive.org/web/20171201130112/reddit.com/r/all/</a> you can see that r/Colorado had a post that was (at that time 8 hours old.) So I got to that subreddit, and at this time it was posted 12 hours ago.
 If you go to the homepage, you can see that that the other posts are 1/2 hours old. So you can conclude that the the other state subreddits followed the same pattern after it was in hot.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I hope this shows that it was started by 1 state, and followed by others.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While I do like the message -- the messenger here is what&#39;s up for debate and that is the very blatant vote manipulation / astroturfing.</p>

<p>I agree with the message.
I don&#39;t agree with the method.</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p>Because once you do something like this ONE TIME.. it can always happen again for a message I don&#39;t like. </p>

<p>for example:</p>

<p>What if the top posts were the 100 most wealthy people in the world who have 50% of the world&#39;s money -- stating that they are good people who have no blame, what so ever, for the state of things in the world.</p>

<p>Once you take this route for a message it can be turned around and used against you very quickly.</p>
