<p>&quot;In the counsels of Government, we must guard against the 
acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or 
unsought, by the Military Industrial Complex. 
The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power 
exists, and will persist. We must never let the weight of 
this combination endanger our liberties or democratic 
processes. We should take nothing for granted. Only an 
alert and knowledgeable citizenry can compel the proper 
meshing of the huge industrial and military machinery of 
defense with our peaceful methods and goals so that 
security and liberty may prosper together.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All Eisenhower wanted to do was to prevent another WW. Dulles massaged the man&#39;s military identity/concerns and manipulated him into thinking the CIA would operate within the bounds of military intelligence defense--not become its own, insidious entity. </p>

<p>I get the sense that Eisenhower recognized what was actually going on a little too late in his administration. That, coupled with the fact that he&#39;d signed off on a significant amount of funding and CIA operations (including the Bay of Pigs), the only thing he could do was speak vaguely about what was happening in his farewell address.</p>

<p>When you look at history, it&#39;s obvious the man was speaking about the CIA and Dulles in particular. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was the Dulles brothers who sold Eisenhower on desposing Mossagdeh a great man and nationalist.
Eisenhower seemed to greatly regret the monster he created. One of the last few years America was truly both good and great. The MIC has rotted the minds and character of America, destroyed the culture and made it surrogates of Zions interests.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Eisenhower wanted to do more than prevent a World War.  His entire policy laid out in NSC 162/2 is centered around active subversion of the Soviet Union, especially in &quot;uncommitted nations.&quot;  He felt that diplomatic overtures and covert operations were the ways to make this possible.  Ike was a strong supporter of covert operations because he&#39;d seen them succeed in Europe.  The CIA definitely got off the leash during Ike&#39;s administration, but he deserves some of the blame.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a great point--from what I have read, not just about Eisenhower but nearly every single major military figure from WWII (with the exception of McArthur--I don&#39;t think it&#39;s coincidential that he was removed from command by the previous administration on account of making public statements regarding China and its military that were blunt, devoid of diplomatic softening and indicative of his plain analysis) feverently believed that the only way to neutralize the possibility of a third World War was to neutralize communism as a global force.</p>

<p>I think Dulles played on this collective belief, which was undoubtedly mitigated by the veterans&#39;s draining and traumatic experiences. The problem with their line of thinking wasn&#39;t that certain types of institutions and people needed to be stopped in order to prevent the erosion of human values and rights--they were correct--but who.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the people who will say and do anything in the name of obtaining power. I do not envy the chill that must have surged through Eisenhower once he realized this about Dulles and the CIA.</p>
