<p>I think you missed this part of my comment:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>(which is really just a made up strawman as an affect of free market capitalism)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It means there is no such thing as trickle down economics. It was coined by those who criticized free market capitalism. </p>

<p>I believe in free market capitalism, which we haven&#39;t had for over 100+ years.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The Federal reserve is a private bank <em>who loans the US money</em>. A country does not need to do this, and it&#39;s outlined on who has the power, authority, and duty to coin monies. </p>

<p>They believe that if rich people hold more money and are not taxed as much, they will create more jobs and the wealth tickles to us through hourly wages. Nothing in there says they&#39;ll do anything different but pocket the cash.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No it&#39;s not, and no it hasn&#39;t. What has, though, is globalism and consumerism under Marxist economics. Central economic planning is the exact opposite of free market capitalism. We have, and have had the former, not the latter, for over 100 years. </p>

<p>The problem is, people are ignorant of this via their schooling, both higher and lower education. Liberal colleges have turn everything upside. Left is now right, and top is now bottom.

    <div class="md"><p>Rofl tax cuts for everyone = hurts the middle class. I mean how are liberals able to lie to themselves this much? Liberals are literally REEEEing because the government isn&#39;t reallocating MORE of America&#39;s wealth into the hands of degenerate, welfare-leaching lefties. What an absolute joke, especially when you consider Hillary, Bernie, and the entire Democratic party ADMITS they want higher taxes for EVERYONE so THEY control who gets how much of your own money. Liberal conspiracy theorists are walking paradoxes.</p>

<p>Liar. Why can&#39;t you talk about this issue without lying? </p>

<p>FACT:Approximately 50% of people in the middle class and below will see a <strong>tax increase</strong>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The stock market isn&#39;t &quot;trickle down economics&quot; and to some extent not even a serious measurement of money.</p>

<p>Take for instance, Jeff Bezos.   Owns billions of stock in in Amazon.  Now, let&#39;s say he wakes up tomorrow and says &quot;Well, I&#39;m done.  I&#39;m going to sell 100% of my shares in Amazon.&quot;  What do you think the stock price would be?</p>

<p>Answer: Amazon stock would go through the floor, and the same could be said for a great many other companies and just about any one that&#39;s got a founder that still has a big stock interest.  That&#39;s a lot of companies including most of the billionaires you can probably name in tech.</p>

<p>I lived thru trickle down economics.  Guess what?  It was a pretty good time to live through. Much better than the Carter and Ford years for sure.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never finished high school and make roughly $140k per year in the oil and gas industry. Because of this industry, some of the top selling vehicle dealerships in the country are found here. Realtors have become very wealthy selling homes to oilfield workers in this area. Hotels are booming in the area and are filled with oilfield workers. The events center, aquatic center, and new hospital were all built with generous donations from oil and gas companies and production service companies.</p>

<p>When oil took a hit, vehicle and home sales plummeted; bars, restaurants, hotels, and strip clubs struggled; the homeless found fewer recyclables discarded; dance and art studios had fewer students and more delinquent parents. Amazingly, as pipelines in the area were approved, work ramped up and everyone not working in oil and gas got customers again.</p>

<p>There most certainly is a trickle down economy and it&#39;s why something as simple as a calling center or a t-shirt factory opening in some towns can be a huge boon. An economy is just like any ecosystem. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The idea of a trickle down economy is not necessarily tied to lower taxes for the wealthy,  but rather creating conditions which encourage investment. One method that has worked well is tying tax breaks with the number of persons employed as it not only encourages investment but also job creation while discouraging layoffs and automation.</p>
