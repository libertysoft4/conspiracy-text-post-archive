        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Pepperidge farm remembers.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been called a shill so many times for just believing that Trump knew about getting help from the Russians. For thinking that Seth Rich was pushed as a cover and there was organized coordination to spam this sub with it and other anti-democrat propaganda. For thinking that Wikileaks is being fed with Russian money. For doubting speculation of pedophilia when there&#39;s no victims or an official code word list that is not from 4chan.</p>

<p>We&#39;ve lost so many good people in these arguments who merely got angry when they saw the blatant lying. When they get attacked for their political beliefs, when someone looks through your comment history to discredit what you say, when they take one look at your name and use it as an argument instead of the subject at hand.</p>

<p>We won&#39;t forget how they treated us. All we did was believe in a conspiracy and wait. Will anything come of it in the end? Who knows? But it certainly looks like the president has Russian connections from being a rich guy in the late 80&#39;s and 90&#39;s and they have the ability to steal emails and fabricate conspiracies against those who they don&#39;t like. I honestly find it offensive people think Russians are so weak they couldn&#39;t pull something like this off or have the resources to coordinate surgical internet political strikes. </p>

<p>Here, let me make this as plane and simple as possible. </p>

<p>On 06.23.2014, Clinton was subpoenaed by Congress to hand over her emails within 30 days. On 06.24.2014, she had them deleted.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t care your party affiliation. If you or I did were subpoenaed by congress to hand over information, and then deleted/destroyed/tampered with that information, we would be locked up in a heart beat. </p>

<p>If you cannot see how clinton broke the law, I&#39;m not sure what&#39;s in your water, let alone the level of common sense. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do you love being wrong?</p>

<p>Yes, I do, actually. To be wrong helps us grow as individuals, so we can strive to be better. However, in this case, Clinton is the epitome of corruption in DC</p>

<p>What charges were dropped as part of this deal? <em>Were</em> there any other charges?</p>

<p>Here is apparently what he did:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The lies that Flynn told FBI agents:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Flynn claimed he did not ask Kislyak to attempt to &quot;refrain from escalating the situation&quot; after sanctions were imposed against Russia by the Obama administration during a December 29, 2016 conversation.</p></li>
<li><p>Flynn &quot;did not recall&quot; that Kisylak told him that Russia planned a moderate response to the sanctions thanks to that conversation.</p></li>
<li><p>Flynn claimed that he did not ask Kislyak to delay or defeat a pending vote on a U.N. Security Council resolution during a conversation on December 22, 2016.</p></li>
</ul>

He is also a (racist)[<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/28/us/politics/donald-trump-housing-race.html?_r=0">https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/28/us/politics/donald-trump-housing-race.html?_r=0</a>] and most likely saw Clinton as another Obama.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It sounds as if you are making some serious errors because you still identify with political parties and/or ideologies. Errors like lumping Trump supporters into a collective &quot;other&quot; because &quot;they&quot; disagreed with you and &quot;we won&#39;t forget.&quot;</p>

<p>Who won&#39;t forget? People that care about truth regardless of what letter is next to your name? Because that&#39;s the only political party that anyone should ever support.</p>

<p>Carroll Quigley admitted political parties are a strategy of tension:</p>

<p>&quot;The argument that the two parties should represent opposed ideals and policies, one, perhaps, of the Right and the other of the Left, is a foolish idea acceptable only to doctrinaire and academic thinkers. Instead, the two parties should be almost identical, so that the American people can ‘throw the rascals out’ at any election without leading to any profound or extensive shifts in policy” </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is that the only response you have to that? Trump being corrupt in no way implies that the Democratic establishment is not corrupt. They&#39;re both beholden to corporate interests and major donors, both voted for disastrous wars and for curtailing our civil rights, and both will happily get rich selling our country and our future prosperity to the highest bidder. </p>

<p>This isn&#39;t a &quot;both sides are the same,&quot; or &quot;Democrats are just as bad&quot; argument. It&#39;s an argument that both sides perpetuate the same corrupt system. They play complementary roles in a drama that takes the attention away from the real, unelected power. </p>

<p>Okay? I&#39;ve said nothing ad hominem against you, so I don&#39;t see how that&#39;s relevant. I get death threats regularly as a mod here.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Honestly, because I find liberals/progressives generally more open to dialogue, and this site as a whole leans Democratic so it&#39;s a bit pointless for me to pile on. But maybe more importantly, right now, Trump is being criticized for his alleged bigotry, personal enrichment, and ties to Russia. All likely true to an extent, but by focusing on these as their political discourse, the left is losing sight of those traditional leftist values with which I do agree: workers&#39; rights and solidarity, opposition to war and foreign interventionism, and civil liberties at home. </p>

<p>When the left strongly supports these values, the country fares better. When Obama won in 08, he continued much of Bush&#39;s disastrous foreign policy, albeit more subtly, and yet much of the anti-war left was silent for fear of criticizing him and weakening his presidency. If Trump is ousted during this term or in the next election, I&#39;m more worried about a relieved left not pushing hard enough for these values.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Trump won because people voted against Clinton or didn&#39;t vote. The Democrats failed to present a coherent vision of the future for all Americans, and instead played into a divisive game of identity politics that alienated or discouraged many voters, and even if it had won, would have served corporate interests more than workers. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>And there are fundamental similarities. I do not trust Democrats to spend taxes wisely and they inevitably concentrate ever more power in the federal government, power which is ultimately wielded by the corporate backers who put them there. The 1950&#39;s were prosperous in large part because the European manufacturing base had been decimated and Asia had yet to industrialize. America was the only real industrial power. </p>

<p>I&#39;d also argue that just as if not more important than high marginal tax rates was strong organized labor movements. Workers leveraged their power collectively and demanded good wages and working conditions rather begging politicians for handouts. Democrats do not fight for increased organized labor, and their voters don&#39;t understand its necessity.</p>

<p>When you play this game of believing the enemy of your enemy is your friend</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s incredibly telling considering I know you.</p>

<p>If you had read one of my previous posts you&#39;d know I hold Russian&#39;s in a higher esteem than most people.</p>

<p>Some of my fellow citizens want to kill me for my admittedly &quot;troll&quot; name to draw out ad hominem. </p>

<p>I never said Democrats were not corrupt but considering repubs were the corporate party since Reagan, why don&#39;t you ever comment at those people? </p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry corporate dems exist, we are trying to destroy them but people keep voting 60 million strong for corporate repubs. </p>

<p>There are fundamental differences you will have to accept one day. I&#39;m not trolling or being a bad voice. I truely believe we could make America great through rich taxation. Like back in the 1950&#39;s.</p>
