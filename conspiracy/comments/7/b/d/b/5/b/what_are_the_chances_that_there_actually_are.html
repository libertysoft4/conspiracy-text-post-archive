<p>While I don&#39;t like to think about the Trump Russia collusion, because I personally believe Trump and TPTB are actually taking these accusations to their advantage since they distract the population from what they&#39;re doing behind the scenes, I am curious about the validity of there actually being a Russian troll farm funded by rich billionaires whose aim is to control social media and therefore influence global politics.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This has been my point of view, I believe they exist, but I also belive their is all sorts of shills and bots operating on behalf of the US government, various private companies and organizations.  Back in 2008 Cass Sunstein proposed the Government infiltrate conspiracy groups to disseminate propaganda and disinfo.  Then in 2011 it was revealed the US military was running a program that allowed users to run multiple sock puppet account to push propaganda on social media.  Since then who know/suspect companies like Monsantos of doing simular operations and then we have CTR and Cambridge Analytics as well.  I personally think (because of Vault u) the Government sold that technology off to 3rd parts after it was discovered, but have no solid proof, just seems like business as usual.  I&#39;m sure Russia was running similar technology in order to compete in the info-war.  With that said, I don&#39;t think that Russia swung our election when you consider the amount of baggage Hillary brought with her to the election and most people were already criticizing for her record and scandals.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Having looked at millions of posts and hundreds of thousands of accounts on Reddit, here&#39;s my opinions:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Are there Russian trolls on Reddit? - Yes, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s to the extent it was on Twitter. Out of all the accounts I&#39;ve looked at, I only have 1 flagged as &quot;Russian troll&quot;. There are many more candidates but it can&#39;t be proven with publicly available data.</p></li>
<li><p>Bots? - To me, &quot;bot&quot; means some form of automation. Yes, there are many bots on Reddit, thousands per day. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Karmaparma/comments/77nny3/hens/">Here&#39;s an example of some being tested</a>. However, the vast majority of bots probably never post and are strictly used for voting. The ones that do post, are spam accounts.</p></li>
</ol>

<hr/>

<p>That said, you can&#39;t really prove motive. You don&#39;t know if someone is making political statements sincerely or not. For every fake account, there&#39;s 1000 more people who genuinely believe the same thing and will discuss it passionately.</p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/xUZ2UEr.png">Shill accusations on this sub went way up</a> but it&#39;s far more likely people simply disagree.</p>
