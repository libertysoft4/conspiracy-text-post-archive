<p>.lying to the FBI.</p>

<p>Prosecutors said Manafort laundered more than $18 million from offshore accounts... He and Gates, his longtime deputy,</p>

<p>hid foreign accounts from the U.S. government,</p>

<p>failed to disclose work for a foreign government and misrepresented their activities to authorities as recently as 2017, according to the 
indictment.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/index.cfm?page=nuclear_where">https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/index.cfm?page=nuclear_where</a></p>

<p>Historically, Russia is one of the top 5 uranium producing countries in the world.  They have been enriching uranium since the late &#39;40s and have produced enough highly enriched uranium that they quit producing it in 1989.</p>

<p>So again, I ask... Why would Russia want our uranium?</p>
