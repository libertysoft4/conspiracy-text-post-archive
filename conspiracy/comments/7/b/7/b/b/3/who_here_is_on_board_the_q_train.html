Q Anon promised indictment against Tony Podesta 11/3. Didn&#39;t happen... Indictment against Huma Abedin 11/6, hasn&#39;t happened. He insisted that these were the two actions that would prove he was telling the truth. Neither has happened = hoax.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>it&#39;s a very good bet that Tony Podesta will be indicted. everyone knew that the moment Company A and Company B were identified as Podesta Group and Mercury in the Manafort indictment last week.</p>

<p>That doesn&#39;t take an insider to claim. QA specifically claims to be an insider and he very clearly said Podesta indictment 11/3 and Huma indictment 11/6, as well as some sort of martial law situation over the weekend. And he said to hold him to that as proof of the veracity of his claims.</p>

<p>none of these things have come to pass and I am now holding QA to his own request.</p>

<p>i&#39;ll repeat - i fully expect tony podesta to be indicted for a financial crime as well as possibly a FARA violation. he didn&#39;t quit his firm for no reason. </p>

<p>but Q anon was absolutely wrong in his original claims. i&#39;m not going to keep getting fooled by a prophet who is wrong more than he is right.</p>

<p>how do i know that pigs don&#39;t fly? because they haven&#39;t flown.
how do i know that tony podesta wasn&#39;t indicted friday? because he wasn&#39;t indicted on friday. don&#39;t move the goalpost after the fact and say that maybe he was super secret double probation indicted. that&#39;s not how credible people operate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He insisted that either of the 2 actions would be the first pole that the storm is upon us.  Not that he was telling the truth.  Either way both did not happen so far.  We also probably would never know until way after the fact.  However we do see Deep State/OPEC players playing defense and Trump/New Saudi Leadership playing offense.  Pretty sure the Deep State released the paradise papers.  Funny how they say it involves the elite but not the elite that own the media.</p>

<p>i don&#39;t know why you&#39;re catching so much backlash.  dude set up his own litmus test for, as you say, the &quot;veracity&quot; of his claims, and to prove whether or not he was bullshitting, and then failed to pass his own test.  a subsequent interpretation, BY HIS OWN STANDARD, would be one that frames QAnon as, in fact, not credible.  Incredible story, no doubt, but <em>not</em> credible, either.  </p>

<p>Should la shit hit la fan, la-ter on, maybe it will change the viewpoint a little, but I don&#39;t see any reason to lend any more ear/eye time to QAnon in light of everything made apparent over the past few days, and by Q&#39;s own playbook.  </p>

<p>all the last-worders and reactionaries commenting you into the land of Nod are aggressively hanging onto fictions over facts, you know, ....like religious zealots or flat earthers or climate-change deniers.  that sort of thing.  it&#39;s the way we do stuff in &#39;Merica now!  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s hard to keep track of what is going on because there is some (what I believe to be intentional) confusion being put out there. For example, someone claimed that Q had predicted the Barack Obama tweet in regards to Texas, verbatim; there were screencaps &quot;evidencing&quot; it. However, when I went and look at the actual 4chan posts, the timestamps indicated that the Q post with the Obama tweet came well after the actual tweet.</p>

<p>There is also still confusion surrounding the Trump twitter attack. Some are claiming Q posted about this before it happened. Others are saying after.</p>

<p>The only thing that are dragging this on and giving it some life is the purge going on in Saudi Arabia.</p>

<p>Also, I&#39;m not sure of this claim because I didn&#39;t look into it, but apparently Q predicted Trump&#39;s unplanned trip to Manila.</p>

<p>I am optimistically skeptical, if that makes sense.</p>

<p>Before. See <a href="https://archive.4plebs.org/pol/search/uid/KC17sSpZ/order/asc/">Q&#39;s post</a>:</p>

<p>Combine all posts and analyze.
The questions provide answers.
Remember, information is everything, the flow of information is no longer controlled by the MSM but by you/others.
Hence, why we are dedicating &#39;critical&#39; time to distribute crumbs which can be followed in greater detail to paint the entire picture once more information is released.
Why has POTUS dedicated so much time into labeling the MSM as fake news?
Why is this relevant?
<strong>We are fully prepared that all social media will be shut down to prevent the spread of this information (i.e. POTUS&#39; Twitter etc. and/or mass censoring).</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can we confirm if 4chan timestamps are in UTC? I need to know if the 4chan timestamps I am looking at are in that format in order to verify 100% that the 4chan post was made before the Tweet from Obama&#39;s account.</p>

<p>If I hover the tweet I can see the UTC timestamp for Obama. However, the 4chan post doesn&#39;t give me that detail. I would assume that the timestamps I am looking at (without hovering for the tooltip) are just my machine&#39;s local time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I monitored the meme warfare that accompanied the election. Especially impressive was the performance of FbiAnon. He came across pretty legit. There were others, almost as good.</p>

<p>Now QAnon, an ideal autist foil, along with southern-friendly female MegAnon, have doubled or tripled down on that 2016 effort. This phase seems more massive and fine-tuned than any /pol LARP ever run to date.</p>

<p>Question: what result happened at the end of the first meme war? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s one very defensible reaction.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s another - consider this as a form of warfare &quot;by other means&quot;. They are literally waging info and meme wars against the political opposition. Sobering. And I am actually sympathetic to a goal of destroying the money corruption and shining a light on the political underworld that brought us JFK and 9-11. However, the implication is that future warfare will rely mainly on controlling people&#39;s minds. Will we trade the brutality and death of kinetic war for mind-monitoring and mind-control wars, that take place between your ears?</p>
