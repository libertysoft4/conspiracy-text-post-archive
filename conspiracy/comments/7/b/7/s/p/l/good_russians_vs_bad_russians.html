        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>There are Russians who fight the globalists. Putin is one of them. He has banned Soros from Russia and taken other steps to restrict Soros&#39; operations in Russia.</p>

<p>Then there are Russians who are part of the globalist Cabal. Oleg Deripaska in particular, who is a Khasarian and in league with Soros and others. And the 9th richest oligarch in Russia.</p>

<p>John McCain has personally and physically met with Deripaska on his massive yacht. Deripaska owns the largest yacht on the planet. The Bush&#39;s, Clintons and Obama are in league with Deripaska and the globalists.</p>

<p>So next time someone screeches on about collusion or meetings or contacts with Russians, ask which Russians. The answer will tell you whether or not it is a good thing or a bad thing.</p>

<p>&quot;26. In all corners of the earth the words &quot;Liberty, Equality, Fraternity,&quot; brought to our ranks, thanks to our blind agents, whole legions who bore our banners with enthusiasm. And all the time these words were canker-worms at work boring into the well-being of the GOYIM, putting an end everywhere to peace, quiet, solidarity and destroying all the foundations of the GOYA States. As you will see later, this helped us to our triumph: it gave us the possibility, among other things, of getting into our hands the master card - the destruction of the privileges, or in other words of the very existence of the aristocracy of the GOYIM, that class which was the only defense peoples and countries had against us. On the ruins of the eternal and genealogical aristocracy of the GOYIM we have set up the aristocracy of our educated class headed by the aristocracy of money. The qualifications for this aristocracy we have established in wealth, which is dependent upon us, and in knowledge, for which our learned elders provide the motive force.&quot;</p>

<p>Large portions of it were straight-up plagiarized by Maurice Joly&#39;s &quot;The Dialogue in Hell&quot;, a satire written over 40 years prior to when an anti-semitic ultra-nationalist party in Russia &quot;found&quot; the Protocols and published them. Someone just went to the library looking for &quot;What evil people sound like&quot; and then copied it and put &quot;Signed, the Jews&quot; at the end.</p>

<p>No, Putin murders his enemies. His last powerful enemy was Khodorkovsky. He threw him in jail and exiled him from Russia.</p>

<p>So you are trying to say that Deripaska was not a puppet by signing factory work agreements after Putin explicitly told him to? If Deripaska was Putin&#39;s enemy, why wouldn&#39;t he just throw him in jail? </p>

<p>I can list off plenty clear cut cases of Deripaska corruption in the mining industry. Putin&#39;s Prosecutor General would find it extremely easy to throw him in jail.</p>

<p>So explain to me how the most powerful oligarch in Russia, worth $15+ billion was able to get arrested in 2003? Mikhail had the same net worth, if not more than Deripaska. </p>

<p>He made a bad mistake somewhere. You don&#39;t think that the rest of the oligarchs got a strong hint over that affair? You don&#39;t think they fell in line to avoid the same fate? And upped their security?</p>

<p>Someone made an example of Mikhail. Just another maneuver in the chess game they&#39;re playing over there.</p>

<p>You are right, but falling in line and being a puppet is the exact same thing, which is what you originally posted.</p>

<p><em>Do you have any proof that all Russian Oligarchs are Putin puppets? especially Soros&#39;s buddy Deripaska?</em></p>

<p>You know, words count. And no, it isn&#39;t the same thing. A puppet goes willingly, falling in line is going along so you don&#39;t get whacked, at least until you can turn the tables.</p>

<p>Words count.</p>

<p>That is the opposite of what a puppet is, otherwise puppets would not have strings. Feel free to show definitions or examples of puppets that have free will.</p>

<p><strong>puppet</strong>: <em>a person, group, government, etc., whose actions are prompted and controlled by another or others</em></p>

<p>That kindof sounds like what happened to Deripaska right there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, technically it can go both ways. A puppet may go willingly and gladly reap the benefits. Or he can go unwillingly. Especially if he doesn&#39;t have the right resources to fend off the puppet master.</p>

<p>I&#39;m saying that these two guys have to tolerate each others existence. And they would gladly be rid of the other if they could manage it.</p>

<p>If either could, I&#39;d say they&#39;d get rid of the other.</p>

<p>I highly doubt that they go to each others homes for drinks and board games.</p>

<p>Not necessarily. It required shitloads of money and muscle. While Putin was working on acquiring power, others were working on acquiring assets. Doesn&#39;t mean they were on the same team. Not at all.</p>
