<p>Guys! We are so fucked the media is releasing where we keep all of our secret money. What are we going to do? There&#39;s going to be international backlash exposing how corrupt we are. We need a distraction will make the front page of every newspaper on Earth!! It needs to be all anyone will ever talk about. It needs to be like 9/11 times a thousand. It needs to be like first contact with aliens. It needs to be YUGE!!</p>

<p>I got it! We&#39;ll use one of our secret brainwashed people to shoot up his church in some small town in Texas.</p>

<p>Perfect!!!</p>

<p>You made it seem like a dumb way to cover up because you put emphasis on the excitement of the supposed conversation.  </p>

<p>If these shootings are actual coverups to simply distract the masses from other important happenings involving high profile people across the world, I would bet locations for mass shootings were chosen long before they actually happen. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let me explain like you&#39;re five. It&#39;s a big deal, especially in Texas, but Texas is not the world. Do you think the Texas shooting is going to be in the news for more than in day in Italy, or Japan, or the UK, or anywhere else in the world. It&#39;s not, it probably won&#39;t be in the front page tomorrow in most of the world, but you what will be? The paradise papers. That&#39;s why saying that the shooting is a cover-up is stupid. This is an international event, and Texas is not the world, no matter how much Texans think it is.</p>

<p>Let me explain it to you like you do live in the US. </p>

<p>Sure it’s an international event. 
But where is gun control “needed” the most? Where is the topic of gun control at its highest? Are most European terrorist attacks carried out with guns? No, they use cars and bombs to kills people. </p>

<p>Now compare the citizens of the US to those abroad. Basically sheep right? The epitome of the ever spending product of mindless capitalism right? </p>

<p>You are just not thinking of how people domestically and abroad from the US take events like this. Does a puzzle have just 2 or 3 pieces? No it doesn’t.</p>

<p>So you saying something can’t be a distraction on an international level JUST because it happened in the United States is what a fucking moron would say.</p>

<p>One more time. This shooting in Texas is not going to distract everyone from the paradise papers. It&#39;s a big story, especially locally, but it&#39;s not big enough to bury the paradise papers story. So, if you were some shadowy iluminati type group trying to distract people, it wouldn&#39;t make sense to fake this shooting, because it doesn&#39;t help you at all.</p>
