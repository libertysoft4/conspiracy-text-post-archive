<p>Other people think a madman killed a bunch of people but something about the story doesn’t add up. </p>

<p>They don’t initially go to the place that the shooter probably isn’t real and all of it is fabricated. They just may think the government is not telling the complete story so they can protect us. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess but a lot of it&#39;s really &quot;vulgar&quot; skepticism, in that it&#39;s not informed by an in-depth knowledge of the how&#39;s and why&#39;s, rather it&#39;s just become very fashionable to be skeptical of institutions. It might seem good now but bear in mind that fashions come and go. People who become skeptical of the government in this shallow way will just as easily become unskeptical again after the cultural tide churns for another cycle.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the point of the U.S. constitution is to not trust the government. We have been setup up by it to be self reliant and not have to rely on them to just live or be worried about being killed by them. If people would actually look back at history and realize government&#39;s before the U.S. eventually devolved into dictatorships or oligarchy&#39;s etc. We are still the only country who&#39;s core tenant is to not trust the government.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The elite led primarily in the US by Zionist Jews and their acolytes in the media are relying on the changing demographics and the brainwashing of the ethnically diverse youth of America. This is why they have rolled out all these New Media apparatus&#39;. These sites, Vox, Vice, etc are led by people like Ezra Klein, Markos Moulitas, Eli Parser and many other Jews. Mentioning such will automatically get you labeled as anti-Semitic and possibly banned around the Internet, but that is what is really happening. I recommend reading up on new media that is being bought up by the old media giants. They simply plan on trying to bury all the factual info that exposes them and continue to barrage the public with their massive propaganda front. The truth be damned. They know the faux left can be easily steered, and they are placing their energy into the promotion of Bernie Sanders, who is also an undercover Zionist stooge, for 2020. Sites like Jimmy Dore, The Young Turks, Jackpine Radicals, Greg Palast, Truth Out, Truth Dig, The Intercept, PBS, Democracy Now, Human Rights Watch (Ken Roth) are all working to steer the middle aged/progressive blinded sheep to support Bernie even though those sites know full well he supported the White Helmets terrorists in Syria. He went along with the false Russian narrative developed by the US Deep State and he also is a cloaked Israel firster who massively supports the MIC. He also supported Clinton during the &#39;election&#39;, and did not call for an investigation into Seth Rich&#39;s murder.....and everyone who is fully awake is aware that Seth was the real leaker of the Podesta and DNC emails, thus they had him killed. Former UK Ambassador Craig Murray has confirmed this, and John Pilger has also stated such. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn’t “wake up” until recently and the LV shooting really opened my eyes. I searched and searched for everything regarding the issue, dismantling the evidence that was provided, doing my own investigative research and now that I share that with people that just think it was a mad man shooting, they put the pieces together as well and think, “hey, I think you have a legitimate point here but why would they do this?” It’s all about control, about putting forth the issues that they want society to believe. Yes, 95% of Americans are still sheep and we can all hope some day things will start to change but what we need to do is keep pressuring the issue, keep asking the questions that aren’t being asked and provide the evidence that they are not wanting us to see </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wouldn&#39;t say the government is or isn&#39;t our friend. I think there are a handful of powerful players that are able to manipulate the government for their benefit. As long as they are growing their wealth and power, the impact on the everyday citizen is irrelevant. </p>

<p>I think a good example of this is showing us on the Maine ballot right now. A wealthy out of state group spent $2 million getting a question that would allow a casino in the southern part of the state. An opposition group has spent a good deal of money trying to discredit that effort. One side claims the group trying to get the casino is super shady and just trying to get the gaming license and flip it to a developer to make a profit. The other side claims they will be supporting schools and such with taxes earned from the casino or something like that. </p>

<p>At the end of the day, one side is backed by the out of state group that wants to build a casino and the other group is backed by another wealthy group that owns the states only other major casino. So to Maine residents, it really doesn&#39;t matter which side wins.  The fact that it got on the ballot means that the government and the people&#39;s right to vote are being used to further the interests of a wealthy few, while providing little value to the residents of the state. </p>
