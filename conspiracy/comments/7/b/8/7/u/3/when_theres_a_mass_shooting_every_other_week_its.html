<p>57 comments in 1 hour lol wow. I&#39;m not saying I&#39;m for gun control but has no one else noticed it&#39;s never a good time for gun laws because it&#39;s &quot; too soon &quot; after a terror attack and when we have these attacks every couple weeks it will never be a time for that talk because it will always be too soon because there&#39;s always shootings </p>

<p>I guess you can take that example as &quot;typical lib doesn&#39;t know where to buy anything except fancy cheese and avocados&quot; or whatever but I quite honestly have no idea where you would purchase a gun. And it&#39;s not like we can&#39;t have longarms, I shot BB rifles all the time at camp, I&#39;m even a decent shot. The whole culture behind guns is just markedly different here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Could&#39;ve been more.</p>

<p>Also, the ease of access argument may be true in your typical kinda &quot;heated argument gone bad and someone goes for a gun&quot; situation (which probably does account for most gun deaths); but with these mass shootings, it&#39;s hard to imagine these guys who are willing to plan it all out wouldn&#39;t go through the little extra effort to get a gun off the black market/make one.</p>

<p>I mean, at this point if you have a 3D printer, you can have an illegal gun.   If you have a YouTube connection and some power tools, you can probably make a gun from a diy video.</p>

<p>Hypothetically, if we could banish all guns from existence, I&#39;d say let&#39;s do it.  But if we can&#39;t, we need to be able to defend ourselves from others with guns.</p>

<p>Dude, you (and every other citizen) are hugely out gunned by a long shot. Your puny little hand guns and a few rifles aren&#39;t going to ptotect you from the government. If/when they want you either disarmed or dead then you <strong>will</strong> be taken out. You have nothing to say about it. If you want to have a &quot;John Wayne&quot; play time, fine, but the reality is that the government has the most, and best, guns. To directly answer your question: It would be the same.</p>

<p>It&#39;s tired because dimwits continue to think that they have way more power then they actually have. The people are <em>afraid</em> of the government which defines tyranny. These dimwits need to understand that they can beat there chests and talk tough all they want. But at the end of the day they are <strong>powerless</strong>. </p>

<p>Not exactly. I see the government for what they are and what they are capable of. I see their motives and methods. You are implying that I am being defeatist. Far from it. The trick to surviving in this world is <em>education</em> and I am <em>not</em> referring to the lame government &quot;education (read: indoctrination) system&quot;. I refer to personal learning that aids survival. Recognizing the problem is the first step to survive the system.</p>

<p>Depending on context, that might not be considered a crime. But saying &quot;I am going to kill you&quot; absolutely is a crime, as it should be in any civilized society</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. Anyone who would trade their rights for a little security will have neither. </p>

<p>Most &quot;mass shootings&quot; are fucking gang related, stemming from the war on drugs. Most shootings in general are done with handguns. Im more likely to die in a car accident every day than I am of ever being shot.</p>

<p>Would you like to tell me what law would have stopped the vegas shooting? Millionaires in the US can get anything they want.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Legalize and regulate drugs. That would stop a majority of the &quot;mass shootings&quot; in the US. Its not the legal gun owners doing 99% of the gun crime. Its CRIMINALS that dont give a fuck about laws. Eliminate the black market and the criminals that thrive from it will disappear.</p>

<p>I wonder why countries that don&#39;t have easy access to guns don&#39;t have daily mass shootings.</p>

<p>To say there is no violence in other nations is absurd. The Nice France truck attack is still higher numbers than the vegas shooting. When people want to hurt people, nothing will stop them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never said there wasn&#39;t violence.  I said there were not daily mass shootings.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t accept violence at all, perpetrated with a gun or perpetrated with a truck.  It&#39;d be nice to work to erduce it as much as possible to the point where it doesn&#39;t happen every fucking day, rather than train yourself and our kids to accept it.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You keep ascribing to be positions I don&#39;t advocate, so I don&#39;t think I need to keep this going.  I never said I want utopia, and I was careful not to.  I said &quot;as much as possible&quot;, which is a lot less violence than we have now.  But, you hear what you want to hear.  </p>

<p>But, the bottom line is we disagree.  You&#39;re not going to convince me that our level of gun violence or violence in general is acceptable or necessary, and I&#39;m not going to change your mind either.  </p>

<p>Good day.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Violent crime rates are down across the board. Crime rates in general have gone down a ton in my lifetime alone. Stopping the one in a million event isnt something you can do through laws. Laws are reactionary, its how the system works. Cant charge someone with a crime they havent committed. </p>

<p>Most of the people I argue with around reddit are 100% no guns for anyone but cops. How would you propose rounding up all the guns? 320000000 people, 119000000 homes, 235000000 cars, in 3.8 million square miles. Thats a big search, especially if we only have the 1100000 police officers in the country to do the search.</p>

<p>Lets ignore just how absurd the cost would be for that, and say you managed to round up literally every gun in the country. Hooray. You forget how open our border is. There is an unending stream of smugglers going in and out. We search less than 5% of vehicular traffic across the mexican border, even less from canada. There would be truckloads of guns bound for the US before the ink was dry on the order to take all the guns. Now we have a population of sitting ducks and armed criminals.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, we do have nukes now.  And you&#39;ll notice on the world stage, any country that doesn&#39;t have nukes get bullied and abused.</p>

<p>Why did we attack Afghanistan for harboring Osama bin laden but left Pakistan alone when we literally found him chilling in a fortress there?  Nukes.  Why do Russia and Israel get to do whatever they want to the lands surrounding them?  Nukes.  Which countries can America not bully into submission?  The ones with/trying to get nukes.  </p>

<p>The same would apply on the personal level with guns.  Or phasers.  </p>

<p>Ever seen trailor park boys?  Imagine a world where guys like Cyrus can do whatever they want.  That&#39;s what we would likely be getting into.</p>
