    <div class="md"><p>I pretty much have agreed with most of your comments I&#39;ve seen you post, which is kind of fucked considering you didn&#39;t Google what I said in my original comment..  are you one of those people running a fake news website, trying to cash in on the shit we talk about, or are you being wilfully ignorant right now?</p>

<p>Google fucking &quot;sealed indictments&quot; in quotes, limit it to the last 24 hours(exactly what I fucking said in my original comment you ignoramus), and you&#39;ll see all kinds of shitty websites covered in ads pandering to what we are talking about.. or at least that was the case whenever I commented over 12 hours ago.</p>
