<p>The poorest are quite literally starving to death, while the royals estate gets richer at the expense of public services. Is this a return to medieval times? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes pretty much, the monarchy needs to go everywhere that there is one. Especially in the UK, which claims to be a democracy yet has these unelected aristocrats with the dubious company they keep, skimming off tons of money from the public purse while fraudulently claiming they deserve it because they &#39;bring in tourism.&#39; As though people visit the UK to see the actual royal family and nt just the palaces etc, which they&#39;d actually be able to see more of were they not all inhabited by these scroungers. </p>

<p>I hope this paradise papers thing raises these questions in the media about whether we should be supporting these people who have just been born to their position and take advantage of it while their fellow human beings starve. It is not right. No one is born &#39;better&#39; than anyone else - that is supposed to be a bedrock principle of Western civilization but it&#39;s clearly not how many selfish and greedy people think, including the Royals.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you are confusing thinks here, perhaps deliberately. The Queen is not required to pay taxes at all, but does on a voluntary basis in the correct amounts. What you should be angry at is the MPs who on average are directors of 2 companies in the UK, and the ultra-rich taking advantage of broken systems. If it turns out your bank invests in offshore via a management company, does that make you culpable? </p>

<p>As to skimming/fraudulent claims, once again your approaching from an oblique angle. A vast amount of the funds the royals get is an allowance from the government, and is 15% of what the crown paid into the government 2 years previously. On top of that, the queen hasn&#39;t been in the top 300 richest Brits in 2 years. </p>

<p>Your jumping up and down about the wrong things - is Lewis Hamilton on your hit list too. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>She pays the correct amounts? And you know this how? If I find out my bank is investing offshore that doesn&#39;t make me involved in their actions whatsoever, the bank is using my money to do what it wants without given consent. I&#39;m sure the Queen isn&#39;t oblivious whats happening to her fortune. </p>

<p>To top it off, the Royals found £370m for the restoration of Buckingham Palace <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/amp.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/nov/18/buckingham-palace-to-undergo-370m-refurbishment">https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/amp.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/nov/18/buckingham-palace-to-undergo-370m-refurbishment</a></p>

<p>Whilst deaths during winter periods are soaring, especially within older people. Not because the weather is harsh, but because people cannot afford central heating: <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/amp.theguardian.com/society/2016/jan/20/older-person-dying-winter-fuel-poverty">https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/amp.theguardian.com/society/2016/jan/20/older-person-dying-winter-fuel-poverty</a></p>

<p>And the Royals aren&#39;t responsible for this I suppose? Because its not like they side with Tories, right? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s exactly the same with the queen, she, like you has people to handle her cash, so she doesn&#39;t have to do it herself. The palace restoration is 370 million over 10 years, and is pushing the royals allowance to 25% of their yearly income. Let&#39;s be clear about this, the crown estate generates some 400 million a year, which goes direct to the treasury, 15% (usually) is given back as an allowance. That&#39;s all the government gives, the rest is from Windsor holdings. </p>

<p>The heating thing is shitty, but not a problem caused by royalty. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Where are you guys getting this info? She doesn&#39;t reveal how much tax she pays on her profits from her inherited estates/land and investments. The only info I found is how much tax she pays for her estates, which considering her wealth is not a lot. For example Buckingham Palace costs her £1,337.62 a year. </p>

<p>But whats more interesting is;
&quot;According to Republic, a group which campaigns for a democratic alternative to the Monarchy, the true cost of the Monarchy to the British taxpayer is actually £334 million a year – nearly 10 times more than the figure published by the Royal Family.&quot;</p>

<p>So how exactly does this show us that they pay more than they take?? Seems like a burden to the entire nation, especially when all the Gov&#39;t does is make cuts on benefits and healthcare. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Medieval times never left. The arise of capitalism has merely expanded the estates of the elite, and the working man is content with &quot;freedom&quot; so long as he cannot see his chains- but they are still there, his relation to his masters unchanged after all this time. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;We cry shame on the feudal baron who forbade the peasant to turn a clod of earth unless he surrendered to his lord a fourth of his crop. We called those the barbarous times. But if the forms have changed, the relations have remained the same, and the worker is forced, under the name of free contract, to accept feudal obligations. For, turn where he will, he can find no better conditions. Everything has become private property, and he must accept, or die of hunger.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;In our civilized societies we are rich. Why then are the many poor? Why this painful drudgery for the masses? Why, even to the best-paid workman, this uncertainty for the morrow, in the midst of all the wealth inherited from the past, and in spite of the powerful means of production, which could ensure comfort to all, in return for a few hours of daily toil?
The socialists have said it and repeated it unwearyingly. Daily they reiterate it, demonstrating it by arguments taken from all the sciences. It is because all that is necessary for production – the land, the mines, the highways, machinery, food, shelter, education, knowledge – all have been seized by the few in the course of that long story of robbery, enforced migration and wars, of ignorance and oppression, which has been the life of the human race before it had learned to subdue the forces of Nature. It is because, taking advantage of alleged rights acquired in the past, these few appropriate today two-thirds of the products of human labour, and then squander them in the most stupid and shameful way. It is because, having reduced the masses to a point at which they have not the means of subsistence for a month, or even for a week in advance, the few can allow the many to work, only on the condition of themselves receiving the lion’s share. It is because these few prevent the remainder of men from producing the things they need, and force them to produce, not the necessaries of life for all, but whatever offers the greatest profits to the monopolists. In this is the substance of all socialism.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is pretty much the argument for describing wage-labor within the capitalist system as &quot;wage-slavery,&quot; and you&#39;re not the first to suggest that- in some ways- life as a feudal serf was &quot;better.&quot; At the very least the medieval serf had some reasonable assurance of existence, and access to communal property to which he had the right of use. Now, however, everything has been made private property, and those with no capital in their possession must make sale of their labor to one who does in order to survive. There is no assurance made to the laborer&#39;s survival, and if his work displeases his master he will be easily replaced.</p>

<p>Nowaday&#39;s people think they&#39;re free if they can choose their master, but in reality the choice is theirs in the end anyway whether to rent your services as a tool or cast you aside like the others. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There needs to be some way out of this terrible system.</p>

<p>Now a days, if you don&#39;t work for someone else and do their bidding, you don&#39;t have a house or other amenities that you really don&#39;t need.</p>

<p>In the middle ages, if you want to eat you harvest the fields. Don&#39;t want to freeze? Chop wood.</p>

<p>It was so much simple. Yes, there was disease, but the ones who died were chosen by natural selection. Today, we have stupid people with weak genes running around because we won&#39;t let their genes be taken out of the pool. This further pollutes future generations with stupidity and weak immune systems, furthering the need for pharmaceutical medications just to keep them alive.</p>

<p>I just want out man. I&#39;ll gladly chop wood to keep warm and build a house, harvest my food to eat and go to the river for water if I&#39;m thirsty. Right now, I begrudgingly go to work and do meaningless shit for someone I don&#39;t give a rats ass about, just so I don&#39;t have to live under a bridge.</p>

<p>The whole point is to not have to do anything for anyone else. To be free of this system and it&#39;s burdens.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My education cost $50k roughly for 4 1/2 years, that&#39;s a new suv in the USA. That doesn&#39;t seem to unreasonable to me. 50k for something that gave me employable skill(s) for the future. What isn&#39;t reasonable is spending 100-150k on an undergrad because  for whatever reason it &quot;was the school for you&quot; then your stuck for years paying it off.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Or are we realizing that we were only provided an illusion of not living in medieval times. I do think that there are brief periods of parody in societies when a regime is dismantled and a new government is built, but once the dust settles, powerful players tend to take control whether in an obvious way or a more subtle way. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The whole idea of a monarch paying taxes is odd.  The UK has a very weird relationship to monarchism.  It&#39;s obvious that deep down most British don&#39;t really subscribe to the basic axioms that justify monarchy, titles, etc.  But it&#39;s surprising how many of them will get their knickers in a knot if one seriously suggests they become a republic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They never really ended. We&#39;re still under feudalism, only now the nobility and the royalty pretend like they don&#39;t exist/don&#39;t have power. The British Empire never ended, it merely became invisible. </p>

<p>Did you know the Queen regularly meets with the British Prime Minister and senior officials?</p>

<p>&quot;The Queen has a weekly audience with the Prime Minister; the topics of these meetings are not recorded. The PM usually has a cabinet meeting before he goes to the meeting with the Queen. The meeting with the Queen usually takes about an hour, and the cabinet meeting about a half a hour. The meeting takes place where ever the queen is in residence, usually Buckingham Palace, Sandringham House, Holyroodhouse Palace, Balmoral Castle, and Windsor Castle usually. Along with weekly audiences with the PM, she has audiences with other cabinet members every week or so, foreign heads of government and state, and receives daily security briefings from the defense staff based at Buckingham Palace. &quot;</p>

<p>Did you know that Canadian officials must swear loyalty to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy_of_Canada">Queen of England</a>?</p>

<p>&quot;The Canadian Oath of Allegiance is a promise or declaration of fealty to the Canadian monarch, taken, along with other specific oaths of office, by new occupants of various federal and provincial government offices, members of federal, provincial, and municipal police forces, members of the Canadian Armed Forces, and, in some provinces, all lawyers upon admission to the bar. The Oath of Allegiance also makes up the first portion of the Oath of Citizenship, the taking of which is a requirement of obtaining Canadian nationality.&quot;</p>
