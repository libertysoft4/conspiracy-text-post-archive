<p>Are you serious? Do you realize every year, the US conducts war games which simulate the assassination of North Korea&#39;s leader? </p>

<p>How would you feel in China was doing war games 30km from Washington DC, in which they simulated the assassination of the US president?</p>

<p>The DPRK only threatens to respond to an attack on their country, to defend their homeland with every drop of blood. They never threaten to attack unprovoked.</p>

<p>Do you not remember Trump threatening to &quot;totally destroy&quot; North Korea just a few weeks ago?</p>

<p>Note that Koreans have never killed Americans on American soil. But Americans butchered 30% of Korea&#39;s population during the Korean War. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The annual war drills which are mentioned in the article include the simulated assassination of North Korea&#39;s leader - mass bombings of North Korean cities - and war drills for a US-South Korean invasion. </p>

<p>Obviously, the North Koreans see this as an extremely serious threat, because at any moment the drills could be modified to a full-scale invasion.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know which country you&#39;re from, but imagine you lived in the US. Imagine if China was doing &quot;war drills&quot; 10 miles off the coast of New York City, simulating the bombardment of Manhattan, the assassination of the US President, and a full-scale invasion of the American mainland. I&#39;m sure you would see this as a very serious threat, am I wrong?</p>

<p>The North Korean launch was &quot;the first step of the military operation of the (North Korean military) in the Pacific and a meaningful prelude to containing Guam,&quot; state media said. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never made the claim that people in NK are living healthy, full lives. I&#39;ve never been there, so I don&#39;t know either way. </p>

<p>The only claim I&#39;m making in this thread is that the DPRK is pursuing nuclear weapons out of self-preservation. </p>

<p>Since you&#39;re the only making claims about life in North Korea, it&#39;s on you to prove those claims.</p>

<p>You&#39;re not wrong, but it&#39;s pretty disingenuous to ignore wide spread famine in NK and the (clearly) higher average standard of living in the united states. and furthermore, just because you don&#39;t like the USA, doesn&#39;t mean NK is somehow magically a better place. you area also allowed to criticize both, which I do.</p>

<p>What evidence would that be? Have you been to North Korea?</p>

<p>Where is your evidence that famine is still widespread in NK? Scholarly sources and journalists reported that the famine lasted from 1994-1998. </p>

<p>It&#39;s true the United States has a higher average standard of living. It&#39;s also true that North Korea has been under extremely harsh sanctions for over 50 years. Despite this, the DPRK is able to give its citizens free healthcare, housing, and education - something we&#39;re unable to do here in the United States.</p>
