        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Was having a chat with a user on here where we kind of got off on a tangent on Kazakhstan. This post wanders around a bit, I hope you guys are able to piece together where I am coming from. I just started thinking about this yesterday, and the ideas are by no means well organized yet. </p>

<p>I mean, wtf even is Kazakhstan? I think I vaguely remember it as a shitty piece of real estate in the board game Risk. Surely it is just a little 3rd world country where people scratch out a meager existence like much of the other countries in the area? Nope, it is large and it is very wealthy, and it is run by a despot that has some very interesting tastes in architecture. </p>

<p>First, watch this quick 10min video on what is going on in Kazakhstan.</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/finIhV70ulY">https://youtu.be/finIhV70ulY</a></p>

<p>Then check out the Wikipedia entry just for background:</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazakhstan">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazakhstan</a></p>

<p>What is with all the Masonic/occult symbolism? How are we not aware of the thriving economy there? What is its history?</p>

<p>So, here it is on a map. Note that huge border it shares with Russia, I will get there later. </p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/DezUxXT.png">https://i.imgur.com/DezUxXT.png</a></p>

<p>Ok, what is the history here? Is it important? There was another influential group of people that originated here. The Ashkenazis. Let us take a look at where they originated from:</p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/3R3LPUO.png">https://i.imgur.com/3R3LPUO.png</a></p>

<p>Map is from here, I would read this too if you are not familiar with the subject of Ashkenazis:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.historytoday.com/nicolas-soteri/khazaria-forgotten-jewish-empire">http://www.historytoday.com/nicolas-soteri/khazaria-forgotten-jewish-empire</a> </p>

<p>All of the happenings in Saudi Arabia have many of us excited, and believe me I am too. I don&#39;t want to be a wet blanket, but I have had reservations, and I would love to be wrong here. See, there are rumors that the SA royalty may secretly be jewish, of at the very least have a much better working relationship that is implied by the media. How is the relationship between Israel and the new ruler in SA? You know the one that just purged the &quot;corruption&quot; in SA? I found this, and this guy looks pretty good for Israel:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.haaretz.com/middle-east-news/1.797007">https://www.haaretz.com/middle-east-news/1.797007</a> </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if there are better. But these happenings have undoubtedly been of great benefit to Israel. What if this isn&#39;t swamp draining, what if Israel is just consolidating power?</p>

<p>We also know that Israel has major issues with Russia which I never really understood until I looked at this stuff, and realized Russia shares a massive border with Kazakhstan. In fact, I believe all of this conflict with Iran and Russia has nothing to do with nuclear weapons, or suspected hacking, or terrorism. It has more to do with Russia being a historical enemy of the Ashkenazi. What if Israel is just bullshit that was used as a means to an end, while the Ashkenazi were secretly preparing for a return to their homeland?</p>

<p>What do you guys think, am I totally nuts?</p>

<p>EDIT: Original thread that this spawned from:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7bq0vx/does_anybody_here_actually_that_think_war_with/dplixy1/?context=3">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7bq0vx/does_anybody_here_actually_that_think_war_with/dplixy1/?context=3</a></p>

<p>Edit 2: one more thing I think is related that I am exploring now, was anyone aware that there is a Chinese sect of Ashkenazi jewish people? I think this could be very important too:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, I skipped a bit and watched at 2x speed but all I really got is that the dictator in charge is a muslim who put up a lot of new monuments with occult/sun worship symbology. Sounds like he thinks he is a god or something. That&#39;s isn&#39;t really very exceptional. Most dictators have god complexes. </p>

<p>I do feel bad for the people who have to live under this fucker, but I don&#39;t see much that makes me suspicious.</p>

<p>Where did you get the idea that Israel is planning on moving to Kazakhstan? Wouldn&#39;t the dictator be against that since currently he rules it?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Both Israeli and Saudi governments are askkenazi and joined at the hip. One pretends to be Arab. The other Jewish. </p>

<p>The strike on the Saudi oligarchy just scared the Shit out of Israel. Why? Trump turned evil brother against evil brother. The Saudi/Israel Union was powerful but turning Saudi into a white hat group is very bad news for Israel so they are threatening Lebanon as revenge. </p>

<p>Israel is temporarily protected because of the Samson option so trump has to attack Israel’s friends Since he can’t attack Israel directly yet. </p>

<p>Consolidation of power is possible but unlikely. We could be getting bamboozled again but consider how hard it is to bamboozle a people who just had a massive awakening. It’s good to be cautious though. </p>

<p>I think of the NWO like a corporation (I’m sure it is but I have no proof), it has many divisions and sub divisions. It may even be worth to postulate whether or not the “NWO” is compartmentalized and most people part of it do not truly understand the endgame. Much like the Manhattan project</p>

<p>In looking at the Book of Revelation as a sort of Hamlet&#39;s Mill prophecied work on astronomical occurrences during the end of Pisces and transition to/entrance into the Astronomical Age of Aquarius, how do you think a religion tied to the Water Bearer Aquarius/Lion of Leo (opposite Aquarius on the zodiacal wheel) will take shape?

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s the thing. Khazakstan ISN&#39;T part of Israel. They used Israel as part of their plot to eventually destroy Jews, Israel, Islam, and Christianity and eventually replace them with their own brand of religion. They were forced by the czars to take a monotheistic religion, and chose judaism, but always kept on performing their satanic rituals. They created the Russian Communist Revoltuion, Hitler, Zionist America, and the New World Order.</p>

Long after that web claim was made a recent sightings occurred in Cape Giradeau, Missouri. Cape Giradeau had a spectacular UFO crash in 1941.
