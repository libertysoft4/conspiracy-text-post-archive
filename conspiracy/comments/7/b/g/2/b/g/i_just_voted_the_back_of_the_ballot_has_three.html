<p>Your Old Guy&#39;s response does not compute. Those measures <em>do not</em> &quot;enhance&quot; constitutionally protected State parks. Those &quot;vital projects&quot; are the very things that the constitutional protections were meant to prevent in the first place.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am glad I voted no on the 2nd and 3rd proposals, but now I see that the first proposal should have been a yes. I hope you realize what your actions are doing to this country. Swiftboating for a no on the first proposal and a yes on the other two was successful. But people are growing wise to these actions and there will be resistance to these results. All these distractions aren&#39;t going to keep us dumb for long.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I want to say one more thing.  When Old Dude and I went to vote.  It was mayhem.  I took him to sit down.  The 3 propositions came up first.  He all ready knew about ConCon, voted NO.  The second was fabulous.  No more pensions for convicted felons  YES!.  The third was different.  Shall we protect yet enhance our State Parks- Catskills and Adirondacks?  YES!</p>

<p>Turned over for crappy votes.  He only voted for one and dismissed the others.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As a matter of policy, that&#39;s simply not how they&#39;re counted.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if the geriatric volunteer you spoke with was lying or clueless but the fact that the elections division has - as always - posted a count of blank votes separate from the yes and no columns flatly refutes the idea that counting them as yes votes is the policy.</p>

<p>If you have any evidence that any blank votes were counted as yes then you should probably go public with it because according to the state constitution and criminal code that would be both unconstitutional and a felony.</p>
