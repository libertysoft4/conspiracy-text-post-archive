        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>&quot;Alice &amp; Wonderland&quot;
Q says HRC is Alice and SA is Wonderland.  </p>

<p>To understand you have to research MKultra / project Monarch.  There are at least 3 MK archetypes:  Alphas, Betas, Deltas.
Alphas are used to carry secret information which can be recalled with a pass phrase.  Betas are sex slaves used for honeypots, blackmail. Deltas are the most complex.  Deltas are &quot;Manchurian candidates&quot;.  Alice in wonderland is associated with Monarch programming.  HRC is a sleeper.  McCain is also a Delta.  Why does Q and compatriots refuse to use McCain&#39;s last name? Why will they only call him John M?  Because John M is only a husk.  Why does he just trail off and stare into space during interviews?  Why does HRC go limp and lose body control and have to be dragged into a van?  Research the Mayo clinic more.</p>

<p>&quot;When the child slave is being subjected to his first programmings, it&#39;s common the force him to read the books &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;   Few people are aware of the deeper occult meaning in these stories, besides the aim to entertain.[14] Both books have in common, that the story contains a second world: Alice&#39;s &quot;Wonderland&quot; and Dorothy&#39;s &quot;World of Oz&quot;. In reality, this is nothing less than each being a symbol for different personalities of the protagonist.</p>

<p>The Monarch slave reads the books again and again, until he gets lost in it. This is supported by the use of cryptic (hypnotic sayings) or general hypnosis by the handler. The slave gets conditioned on many triggers from these stories.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The same thing happens here when Jesuit&#39;s are mentioned. I went to a Jesuit high school and college and extensively dealt with their brotherhood (Society of Jesus) and I have nothing but good things to say about them especially in comparison with standard catholic priests. I am not religious at all, but my education and the things I learned from them had a profound impact on my life and views. No one takes better than the homeless than they do and no one cares about education as much as they do, and that includes providing a great education free from bias to those that need it the most (impoverished) my Jesuit teacher who taught Old Testament frankly states that most if not all the stories in the Bible didn&#39;t really happen but were allegories and tales to teach morality or explain things that were hard to explain to uneducated people at the time. They taught evolution and believed in science heavily. Yet everyone here shits on them so much it&#39;s absurd. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Out west. Had a priest (Jesuit) one discus transubstantiation with me. Told him how I thought it was metaphysical and was told well, likely it was but that was how the Catholic Church kept control of the illiterate masses years ago. He also said he didn&#39;t think sacrament of communion was necessary or the purpose of Christs love and sacrifice. Mind blown, a priest saying this. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I also went to a Catholic School of a different brotherhood. I agree with you that the Society of Jesus has done a lot of good. However, this is a false representation of The Jesuits. It would be like me claiming that knowing a few beginner Freemasons and believing them to be cool people would disprove the idea that Freemasons had a monumental role in American history. It has no relevance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All the great propagandists of the 1st century were able to pack at least a few meanings into their veiled messages.  The aristocrat royals were also scribe-historian-propagandists.</p>

<p>Titus Flavius Caesar had 2 servant-friends.</p>

<p>Josephus Son of Matthew was his Jewish authority publisher and Roman Client Governor of Judea.</p>

<p>Lucius Plutarchus was his Greek authority publisher and Roman Client Governor of Greece.</p>

<p>So this is how it would work.</p>

<p>Josephus:Did you hear about the magician who turned water into wine? It means that holy street preachers have the power to make the most of so very little.</p>

<p>Plutarchus: What? Did he use a trick jug? What a fraud.</p>

<p>Titus: You know. Water into wine refers to drinking water and urinating. The urine is the wine. Hey, you know, Josephus. Those rebels made trouble for us in the name of Parthia and those traitorous Herods have a legend of one such rebel. I want you to write. &quot;And he turned water into wine for the multitudes.&quot; That way, when all of these slave rebels in our new Church listen to that, the 3 of us can always have a private laugh as to what it really means.</p>

<p>So in this way, you should always interpret people with over-active minds.</p>
