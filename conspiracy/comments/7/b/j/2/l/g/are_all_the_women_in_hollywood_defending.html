    <div class="md"><p>Hi there. I&#39;m not religious myself, but as a secular Jew I&#39;m pretty well versed in our bible, and have had some small exposure to the talmud &amp; g&#39;mara. Given that, and with half my family being orthodox (&quot;haredim&quot; as we call them here), I can somewhat answer your call.</p>

<p>I think there are two things to keep in mind here:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The literalist sects of Judaism have all but vanished. Orthodox Judaism is all about discussing (read: arguing) the meaning of words in even a single sentence, and countless references are needed to back up any interpretation. What that means is that even if there&#39;s a sentence somewhere in the talmud (and I&#39;ve certainly never seen it) that allows this kind of abomination, no one in their right mind would dare use it as a justification to anything.</p></li>
<li><p>The talmud isn&#39;t entry-level liturgy, and the people mentioned in the OP (even if they are observant Jews) wouldn&#39;t necessarily have access/exposure to it. So, the Christian equivalent to this claim is finding some obscure sentence in Augustine of Hippo&#39;s writings that doesn&#39;t agree with modern values, finding some Christians who (purposefully or unknowingly) fulfill that statement, and using it to generalize the thought process of all Christians. It&#39;s basically just libel.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>hahahaha yeah right. 50% of Jewish children are raped by their religious elders in this sect! The parents don&#39;t care that their children come home with bleeding anuses because they&#39;re so brainwashed by this bullshit! You are so full of shit!</p>

<p>From the Talmuld:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“When a grown-up man has intercourse with a little girl it is nothing, for when the girl is less than this (three years and a day) it is as if one put the finger into the eye.” The footnote says that as “tears come to the eye again and again, so does virginity come back to the little girl under three years.” 11</p>

I&#39;m not gonna &quot;true scotsman&quot; my own claim though, and accept your point. I just honestly didn&#39;t know. I&#39;ll keep that in mind next time someone asks me. Still, what does that sect have to do with your OP on Hollywood?</p>

<p>Also, and with all due respect, I am reluctant to debate the talmud after it was translated to English. Once someone fixes a translation like that (from Aramaic) we could be debating a literal strawman. Since your link is from the daily stormer, I think that&#39;s exactly what they had in mind.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jews admit these translations are accurate.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The rabbis of the Talmud, living as they did in the first centuries C.E., did not share our modern intuitions about these subjects. Under Jewish law, rape is indeed a serious crime, with penalties laid out in detail in the Book of Deuteronomy. But in this week’s Daf Yomi reading, as the rabbis explored the penalties for rape of a virgin, it became clearer than ever that rape was not the same crime to them as it is to us. Today, we consider it a crime of violence against an individual; for the rabbis, it was more significantly a crime against a woman’s reputation, which had serious effects on her social standing and her marriage prospects. Their remedy for rape, then, was not to imprison or execute the rapist, but to insist that he make reparation to the victim’s family—either by paying a fine or by offering to marry his victim.</p>

<p>By the same logic, there is no fine for the rape of a woman who is presumed not to be a virgin. That is made clear in Ketubot 36b, where the mishna says that the fine is not paid by “one who has intercourse with a convert or with a captive woman or with a gentile maidservant.” </p>

<p>And if you are wondering the relevance? Because Polanski used &quot;she wasn&#39;t a virgin&quot; to excuse his drugging and anal rape of an underage girl.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Is raping children even illegal in the Talmuld? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Talmud is a legal discussion and legal training text. It has a lot of laws in it, but is not a legal code. More like a comprehensive anthology+ commentary. It has not been significantly edited or added for over a thousand years. So yeah, there is some fucked up shit in there from any perspective.</p>

<p>Most US Jews have never seen a tractate Talmud or could recognize it in a library, let alone read it and understand it. Basically, the talmud is largely irrelevant to the lives of most Jews alive today, <em>especially</em> if they are culturally rather than religiously Jewish (~60% <a href="http://www.pewforum.org/2013/10/01/jewish-american-beliefs-attitudes-culture-survey/">http://www.pewforum.org/2013/10/01/jewish-american-beliefs-attitudes-culture-survey/</a>)</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Jews follow the law of the government ( and consider lawbreakers criminals), and do not see it as conflicting with religious priorities or religious laws in any way. Religious matters and their associated laws and practices have been isolated out from Jewish legal tradition for over 200 years (See the wikipedia article on Jewish Emancipation). Since that time, the rest of the legal tradition-- the parts that deal with non-religous matters-- have been effectively abandoned and are only of interest to students/academic professionals. </p>

Those two are among the beliefs of elite Khazars who are fake converted &#39;Jews&#39;. Roman Catholicism is also Babylonian-Mesopotamian occult.

<p>Speaking this week at a charity event in London, the Oscar-winning actress said: &quot;<strong>I just know I am Jewish.</strong> I practise nothing. I don&#39;t go to temple, but I do remember the holidays. Religion is a lot of work, it&#39;s exhausting. So I keep it simple, I have a pretty good relationship with God. We talk.&#39;&quot;</p>

<p>If you work in an industry run by Jews their morals (or lack thereof) will rub off on you. </p>

<p>Then again, many Catholics are pedophiles too.</p>

<p>The pope wears the same silly hat Jews do.</p>

<p>hahahaha yeah right. 50% of Jewish children are raped by their religious elders in this sect! The parents don&#39;t care that their children come home with bleeding anuses because they&#39;re so brainwashed by this bullshit! You are so full of shit!</p>

<p>From the Talmuld:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“When a grown-up man has intercourse with a little girl it is nothing, for when the girl is less than this (three years and a day) it is as if one put the finger into the eye.” The footnote says that as “tears come to the eye again and again, so does virginity come back to the little girl under three years.” 11</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you very much for answering the call. I think nomenclature is very important when witch hunts happen. I will research anything I deem suspicious but I&#39;m tired of seeing things like &quot;Evil jews&quot; and &quot;evil muslims.&quot;.....These are way too vague of generalizations for entire groups of people. Thank you for furthering my education in this matter.</p>
