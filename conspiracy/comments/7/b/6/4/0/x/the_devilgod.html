So.. we might as well conclude thay the devil is real.
But if the Devil is real, then God must be real too.
For every positive there is a negative. If there is hapiness then there must be sadness too, otherwise you wouldnt know what hapiness meant. So if there is a devil then there is a God too. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>“Devil” many times is used as a metaphor for the temptations that destroy a person’s moral characters. When people say that demons or devils are real, many times they are referring to addiction, the love of money, sex, or fame, mental illness, persistent negative thoughts, etc. Not a literal guy with red skin who has horns and a forked tail who lives in hell. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Those all stem from demonic influence over the mind. Your description of the devil is also a cultural one, he&#39;s known to be one of God&#39;s most beautiful creations and an &quot;angel of light&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, “Lucifer” is translated as “light-bearer” in Latin, but that is also cultural and not something that is “known.” Many cultures have anthropomorphized the idea of evil, and they vary widely among different systems of belief </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you believe these icons are referring solely to the cultural image of the devil? Could it not be that they are using this cartoonish societal fabrication as cover for what they actually feel? Considering the elite have already been exposed in their occult practices like spirit cooking and the cremation of care ritual I don&#39;t think it too much of a stretch of the imagination. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’m not sure what your question is here. Cultural images are “societal fabrications,” which are also metaphors created by humans to represent abstract concepts. “Evil” and “badness” can be felt and manifested through various acts, but the idea of a “devil” is just a personification of these abstract concepts </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m saying that these people who sing and talk about &quot;selling their souls to the devil&quot; are meaning that in a far more literal way than what you are describing, I thought I was pretty clear about that. Lucifer exists as an actual entity not merely a cultural personification of the abstract concept of evil, he&#39;s the one who introduced us to that concept in the first place like an older brother giving his younger sibling drugs and porn mags. And that this entity, The Adversary, is the root of the elite&#39;s occultic practices and rituals which bleeds over into the actual media they produce.</p>
