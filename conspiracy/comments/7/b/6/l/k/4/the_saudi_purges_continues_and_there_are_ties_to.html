<p>Prince Alwaleed Talal and 10 others arrested.</p>

<p>Prince Mansour bin-Muqrin and 7 other high ranking officials killed in crash. </p>

<p>Saudi Prince Abdul Aziz bin Fahd dies during arrest in a &#39;strange and sudden death&#39;.</p>

<p>Lebanon PM forced by Saudis to resign.</p>

<p>Saad Hariri&#39;s bodyguards had confirmed that there was an assassination plot against him.</p>

<p>All within 72 hours.</p>

<p>7 of the 14 Saudis arrested for corruption worked with the Podesta Group. </p>

<p>If Tony Podesta is indicted Huma will be also. </p>

<p>Huma has connections to Muslim Brotherhood which is how Clinton’s campaign was funded by Saudi Arabia and she knew they were also funding ISIS. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t understand how the Sutherland Springs shooting is a viable argument for gun control though. Kelley was dishonorably discharged from the Air Force, which means he was not able to legally purchase a gun, no? How did he get an AR-15 then?
And Kelley was shot by a bystander who was a legal gun owner. Neither the &quot;ban guns&quot; nor the counter-narrative are necessary in this case.
I&#39;m just trying to get through all the noise to find out exactly what happened. What we know so far is that Kelley was an avowed athiest who made threats to his mother-in-law, who was a member of the church he shot up. Do we all agree on those facts?
I don&#39;t know what to make of Kelley&#39;s Facebook page, because the waters have already been muddied by both sides. Do we know who he followed, who his Facebook friends were and what his &quot;Likes&quot; were?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To my understanding in Wake County in North Carolina (where the capital city Raleigh is and where I live) the sheriff is allowed to deny concealed carry permits at his discretion even if the person passes a background check. I believe this or something similar is pretty standard. This is why he could have been denied a carry conceal permit. A standard background check would fail if the paperwork was put in wrong which seems to have happened. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Saudi succession has no concept of primogeniture. Meaning, there&#39;s no &quot;first born son&quot; rule. This is the first generational change of Kings since the 40s. You basically kill or be killed until someone is the last left.</p>

<p>There are plenty of politics relating to the West, but this was going to be a blood bath no matter what. What&#39;s interesting is the top dog seems to be promising the West everything: peace with Israel, IPO their oil, and moderate islam.</p>

<p>He also plans to end subsidies and make the Saudis pay taxes for the first time.</p>

<p>This blood bath is nothing compared to what happens if this guy can&#39;t hold power. Internally their will be pissed off extremists fueled by poverty, and I guarantee you whoever takes over then renationalizes the oil saying fuck you the multi-trillion dollar investors in the West, all while destabilizing relations in the region and with Israel. Imagine the Iranian Revolution + ISIS, but bigger, and in the Holy Land. Yeah.....</p>
