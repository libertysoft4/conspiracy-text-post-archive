<p>Case and point, someone asked for proof that security cameras MUST have led lights in them to be real cameras and recording.</p>

<p>Now that&#39;s just stupid. Any person can be recording in a public place at anytime and no one needs to get notice. It&#39;s apart of the freedom of press, first amendment rights in the US.</p>

<p>Now a bunch of &quot;special people&quot; downvoted my comment and asked for &quot;proof&quot;. The problem is that you can provide proof because the question is so patently false, there&#39;s not even an article on the subject. Also, it&#39;s so damn stupid I&#39;m not wasting my time.</p>

<p>I think at this point is time, it&#39;s safe to assume no one with even a hair of common sense should be providing proof upon request. It&#39;s just a bunch of jack offs requesting proof because they think they can &quot;win a conversation&quot; by requesting it. When in reality, you should only be asking if you are truly interested and are seeking truth,</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don’t know specific example OP is taking about, but I think there’s also a difference between claiming something as undeniable fact and clearly stating is conjecture or opinion (and everything between). Some users get hostile when you point out evidence against their hypotheses because they are confusing their own strong feeling with facts. Some users get defensive for them. </p>

<p>What’s interesting is that there are several users who will shit on others hypotheses/evidence/“subtly”break rule 10 but will state their beliefs as fact, with absolutely no proof, then call others shills for making an effort to show evidence. </p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t be surprised at all. I bet there are people playing both sides too. And some of them, of course, are just obsessive bullies. </p>

<p>I have also noticed, I think, an uptick in mean-spirited, low-hanging bait posts (Like choosing an unpopular comment and holding that up as an example of the community as a whole). I think its dumb because they could probably find plenty of popular examples and common circlejerks that would be cringey to a lot of casual uses. </p>

<p>In my opinion that makes for a low quality content in a meta sub, but TopMinds seems to have a bit of <a href="/r/Drama">/r/Drama</a> flavor where some of them want to bait the more unhinged and sensitive users. </p>

<p>There are some really hostile people on here but I like to talk to them at times because I don&#39;t really have a dog in the political fight, but they do and I like being able to politely talk to them as they devolve into ad hominem. My only real goal, other than observing all political intrigue, is showing with proof that there are actual shills here. I don&#39;t know what political affiliation or their true motivations, but they are here copying comments and cross posting from other subs, using alts to avoid bans, trying to lure people into bans, and sock puppeting to support their alt accounts. I have a few posts the admins asked me to send them to see if there is vote manipulation but I have yet to collect the links. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>People don&#39;t question their entitlement these days. Like PROOF of an international conspiracy or an ongoing investigation is going to be a click away. </p>

<p>Some of these proof demands are guaranteed paid topic-detractors. They are being paid to scour the Internet for claims against entities. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wholeheartedly agree with OP that over-saturation of information (real or fake) can and will dilute the content, in it of itself.  </p>

<p>To your comment, &quot; Also, it&#39;s so damn stupid I&#39;m not wasting my time.&quot; ---- This &#39;time&#39; that you are a part of, at this very moment is more important than ever. Don&#39;t be taken by surprise to find that many folks want you to waste your time. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Me and my brother bet heads with this. He&#39;s always asking for &quot;proof&quot; and  it makes my eyes glaze over. We all have the internet. We have similar tools to aquire the info. To ask ME for proof is excusing themselves to actually work at there own investigations. I don&#39;t have the time let alone the patience to hold someone&#39;s hand and step by step administrate the red pill. Also hurts that he&#39;s in a  college  bubble being an all mighty scientist and I work my insurance job killing time by spending half my day googling what I want. But fuck me right. I&#39;m not in college atm so apparently my opinions mean dick. He&#39;s a great example of the college bubble. My advice to those who need to silence a doubter? Hunt for patents. The best defense I have. Patents are some great evidence that designs and functions are being designed and in the works</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Many people have said this over and over. But if there was solid proof, it would not be a conspiracy THEORY. </p>

<p>Asking for proof is what lazy people do so they don&#39;t have to think. </p>
