        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><strong>I witnessed a kidnapping.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Note</strong> while obfuscating my and other relatives names, I will include as much information as I can remember, in order for anyone who actually wants to look into this case, to be able to do so if so inclined.</p>

<p>It all started simply enough, with a trip down to see my grandparents in Gulfport Mississippi sometime in the early 1980&#39;s.  I don&#39;t quite remember the time period, but I believe that at the time I was between first and second grades, so that&#39;d put it sometime around 81 or 82, maybe 83 at the latest.  </p>

<p>Whatever the case, two of my cousins (both 14 or so at the time) stated they were going to the 7/11 which was two, maybe three blocks down from where my grandparents lived. My parents were okay with me going with them, and even gave me a couple dollars to buy some gum or something.  </p>

<p>When we reached the store, I remember some key details; and some stupid ones.  Such as that there was a flatbed trailer parked in the lot, with one of my cousins explaining that the trailer was being used as a band stand out on the beach every weekend (key), and that I used my money to buy that crappy gum in a toothpaste tube.</p>

<p>Location wise, this 7/11 was next door to a Howard Johnson&#39;s inn (this will become important), and right on the beach.</p>

<p>As I said, we made our purchases, then headed out.  At this point, well things turned bad.</p>

<p>We were milling about, with my cousins talking about the various bands that were playing at the beach that weekend, when we heard screaming coming from the direction of the motel.</p>

<p>As we watched, a man burst from a room located at the end of the second floor.  The man was dressed in a blue plaid shirt and jeans, with longish hair.  Right behind him was a second man, dressed in red plaid, longish hair as well, but with a full mustache.  The second man had a small boy, about my age, in his arms, and was running.  The two men jumped into a chevy pickup (red and white) and sped out of the parking lot, while a woman stood up at the top of the steps screaming that &quot;they had taken her son&quot;.</p>

<p>When we got back to my grandparents&#39; apartment, I related the story to my parents, who at first didn&#39;t believe it as my cousins kept claiming nothing had happened and I was obviously making up the story.  Eventually the incident was featured on the Biloxi news, and at that point my parents seemed to believe me.  Curiously, rather than have me tell the police what I witnessed, my parents packed up and drove us back home.  Even though we had planned to spend the week there.  </p>

<p>Since that time, and until their dying days, my mother and father would not discuss the incident, beyond saying that what they did was for my own good.  With the advent of the internet, I have tried finding out about the story, even considered contacting the Biloxi police about it...but like I said, I haven&#39;t.  I&#39;m 42 now...and I&#39;m ashamed to say that the story still gives me nightmares.  I have never said anything to anyone about it, never told the tale, and never really put any effort into looking too far into it beyond a few abortive searches for similar cases.  Truth be known, this is the first time I have ever talked about the case in any real form.</p>

<p>Now, as the whole pedogate thing starts to really pick up speed...and the lack of any real information on this case (and let&#39;s face it, child kidnappings are <em>always</em> talked about, even after the case is closed) I find myself starting to wonder if I saw something that the powers that be don&#39;t want to talk about; or if I&#39;m making something out of nothing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Does Biloxi have a local newspaper (or did they have one at the time)? If so, do you remember the month this happened? Summer, perhaps because of Beach concerts? Can you research the years 81, 82 and 83 of this newspaper to see if you can find it?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hadn&#39;t thought about that, but yes, Biloxi would likely have a paper of its own.  It was considered the &quot;big city&quot; so to speak, though it wasn&#39;t much larger than Gulfport at the time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s haunting you for a reason. If time didn&#39;t heal, maybe speaking about it will. You were just a kid and nobody will fault you for not speaking up sooner. You seem to have your heart in the right place. Considering you do remember some details, you may want to do some digging to see if the case was ever solved. If not, it might help you to let it off your chest to any detective that may still be working on the cold case. My heart goes out to that little boy and his family....I hope you can find some closure, God bless.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_murders_of_1979%E2%80%9381">Op, your timeline fits with a string of kidnappings &amp; murders in Atlanta around the same time.</a></p>

<p>Mobile is a short trip from the central location of these abductions &amp; murders. This case is still unsolved, despite attributing the murders to Wayne Williams, and despite the fact that the murders continued after he was arrested. This case has also been theoretically attached to a separate abduction/murder spree in Michigan. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The first thing you need to do is to narrow the exact time of the event as much as possible.  Exact year and week would help.  It&#39;s not hard.  Sit down and start thinking without distractions.  You say you think it&#39;s between 1st and 2nd grade.  Just think about event before the incident and after.  You can just ask your parents or cousins without clueing them in to your motives.  Ask them about the summer you spent at your grandparents and bring up other details from the trip and just say you&#39;re curious because you miss those times.</p>

<p>After you have the exact or approx date you can search for any patterns around those dates.  Look for missing child reports or newspaper articles.  Granted, this is before the internet so unless it was digitized, you won&#39;t find any native online info.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know how deep you want to get but you probably won&#39;t be able to do much unless you visit that town and talk to people.  Old detectives, neighbors, etc.   Good luck to you.</p>
