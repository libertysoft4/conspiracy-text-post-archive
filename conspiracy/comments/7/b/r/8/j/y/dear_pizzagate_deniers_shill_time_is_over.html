With that being said, why don&#39;t more people in the U.S. care about the thousands of people who die from guns?

    <div class="md"><p>Did the guns stand up, walk into that school and kill those kids? Or did those disturbed kids pick them up, load them, point them, and kill those kids?  The root of the problem isn&#39;t the tool, it&#39;s the user(s).  There are laws against speeding, people still speed.  There are laws against stealing, people still steal.  There are laws against murder, people still kill (with guns, knifes, baseball bats, crowbars, etc).  You can&#39;t legislate morality, you can&#39;t make anybody do a damn thing.  Just because guns are illegal, criminals will still get their hands on them.  Criminals don&#39;t follow laws already on the books, making up new ones won&#39;t make them start all of the sudden.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If the mentally ill are NOT able to acquire guns as you say, then a whole lot of people are either not doing their jobs, or maybe just maybe the definition of mentally ill is not what I think it is. </p>

<p>As for your last statement, there is almost one gun owned per person in this country (<a href="https://qz.com/1095899/gun-ownership-in-america-in-three-charts/">https://qz.com/1095899/gun-ownership-in-america-in-three-charts/</a>).  These are just the guns owned by the private citizens, so now add in the number of guns that are government owned and its plausible to say that there is basically one gun per person in this country. There is about 252 million religious followers in the U.S. <a href="http://www.pewforum.org/religious-landscape-study/">http://www.pewforum.org/religious-landscape-study/</a>
That is a lot of &quot;good&quot; guys with guns and a prayer, seems to me mass shootings should be non existent with that going for us. </p>

<p>This last church shooting easily could have never happened if people (USAF)did their jobs. I think we have to use the gun controls that are already on the books , and use them consistently before we go around  saying gun control does not work. </p>

<p>Well, when you find a magic pill to get people to do their jobs, let me know.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, that does not change the fact that the laws are on the books.   And simply &#39;writing a law&#39; DOES NOT WORK if it is not enforced.</p>

<p>However, the main problem at the end of the day is not even enforcement: it is the heart and mind of the shooter.   Which gets right back to better mental health treatment which is needed.  And even to prayer, which the shooter probably should be engaging in for his mental health.</p>

<p>It also gets to corruption in our government -- because too often rogue elements in the government actually use mentally ill people as patsies for false flags.</p>

<p>You must not be a regular to this sub, or you would know about all this already....GOV. is using mentally ill many times.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No I am a regular to the sub, I just don&#39;t comment as much as some. Also I have never fully subscribed to the patsie false flag theory as much as many others have. I think we need to take a good hard look at ourselves in the mirror as a country and realize that we are are all accountable for what happens. We need to have the hard conversations respectfully, not just throwing insults at each other. We have to have open minds when having those discussions. We can&#39;t come to discussion with bias in thoughts. That&#39;s why I don&#39;t immediately think every shooting is a false flag government patsie. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe Pizzagate affects all of us because the people who are in charge of the big decisions in the world, who are responsible for war and hunger when it need not be that way are the very same people who are indulging in sex with underage victims. They are being blackmailed and corrupted by the use of child sex slaves. I truly believe this to be the case, and even if you don&#39;t care about children for whatever reason, the fact that this mechanism for ultimate control over a person is in place has an effect on how our tax money is spent, etc.</p>

<li>Donald Trump - He was also part of Epstein&#39;s pedophile ring, even <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2017/05/04/jeffrey-epstein-trump-lawsuit-sex-trafficking-237983">testifing about it in court.</a> Over a dozen women have accused Trump of rape, he bragged about walking in on naked teenager models, bragged about sexual assault, and was friends with Epstein. Sounds like he fits right in with his political/Hollywood pals.</li>

    <div class="md"><p>In what way are you explaining any of the questions mentioned by OP?  Yea so trump acts immature sometimes but guess what Timmy, so do you with the “But..but...somebody said something about trump doing some bad things to”  Sounds like a 2nd grader level comment.  By the way many of us don’t trust trump either and if he is involved then we need to get him to.. but like him or not you should have saved that ignorant comment because it is very revealing as to your intelligence level and/or your motive here.  Is it because you have no response to OP questions that you make an Absolutely absurd and childish response about accusations against Trump that wether true or not are dwarfed by terrible facts in reference to kidnapping kids in Haiti and the terrifying evil content on alefantis IG.  That man should be investigated for the IG content alone!  How is it that you are so easily convinced Trump is guilty of so called accusations or anything else close to the level of kidnapping, trafficking, raping children but no matter how many facts, pictures, or dots that connect in relation to pizzagate you people refuse even consider it true.  </p>

<p>If I had never seen those IG pictures, podestas art, or heard the facts surrounding silsbys arrest and someone sat me down showed it to me,  the last thing that i would say in reference to this post is “but... but.. president trump said you can “grab a woman by the Pu$$y”.  (Which btw is not bragging about sexual assault as you exaggerated.  What he actually said was the if you have a lot of money you can grab a woman by the pus and she doesn’t care which nowadays is sadly true).  But, regardless of that trump comment It does not make it pizzagate okay or irrelevant and it makes no sense for someone to respond to those facts in that manner.  I hope you are a shill because if not something is wrong with you and your sidekick happyog.  It’s almost as if your trying to defend pizzagate suspects or somehow trying to distract.  </p>

<p>And for the record idgaf about Trump or trust him.  But tell me this how are you so matter of fact on trumps guilt but not pizzagate when the comparison of actual evidence for pizzagate crimes far outweigh your exaggerated claims of trumps crimes.  Further, if There was half of the amount of evidence out there for trumps guilt as there is pizzagate evidence and you pointed it out in a post the last effing thing I would say is “but.. but... Cruz watches porn on Twitter”  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump did fly on Epstein&#39;s plane. <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1508967-deposition-excerpts.html">Source</a>.</p>

<p>Trump&#39;s nominee for labor secretary is the reason that Epstein got a BS sentence of 13 months. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/labor-nominee-acosta-cut-deal-with-billionaire-in-sex-abuse-case-involving-40-underage-girls/2017/03/21/d33271a8-0d85-11e7-ab07-07d9f521f6b5_story.html?utm_term=.a4be296df8fb">Source</a>.</p>

<p>Epstein had 14 different phone numbers for Trump in his personal book, including Trump&#39;s wife, houseman, and daughter. <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-billionaire-pedophile-who-could-bring-down-donald-trump-and-hillary-clinton">Source</a>.</p>

<p>Trump and Epstein are both named in a lawsuit regarding the rape of a 13 year old in New York City in the 80&#39;s. <a href="https://www.snopes.com/2016/06/23/donald-trump-rape-lawsuit/">Source</a>.</p>

<p>When Epstein was asked under oath if he&#39;d ever &quot;socialized&quot; with underaged girls with Donald Trump, he plead the fifth, sixth, and fourteenth amendments. <a href="https://news.vice.com/article/the-salacious-ammo-even-donald-trump-wont-use-in-a-fight-against-hillary-clinton-bill-clinton">Source</a> (this is also backed up by the same source proving he flew on the plane)</p>

<p>Trump once said “I’ve known Jeff for 15 years. Terrific guy. He’s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it, Jeffrey enjoys his social life.”</p>

<p>I&#39;m assuming Trump banned Epstein to save his own ass. But Epstein being banned in the first place is still disputed. <a href="https://pagesix.com/2007/10/15/sex-case-victims-lining-up/">Source</a>.</p>

<p>Looks like Trump and Epstein have been scratching each other backs for a while. Trump appointing Acosta proves that in my opinion.</p>

<p>Even then, your comment still doesn&#39;t refute <a href="/u/timmyg2017">/u/timmyg2017</a> &#39;s statement regarding Trump literally bragging about walking in on underaged girls changing during one of his beauty pageants. </p>

<p>Trump is the perfect candidate to be dragged through the mud for pizzagate in my opinion. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most likely because they flew dozens of times. Also you&#39;re assuming that the passenger manifest on flight logs are 100% accurate.</p>

<p>Did you know that none of the logs show Clinton flying to Lolita Island aboard Epstein&#39;s plane? They flew together to Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore, China, Brunei, London, New York, Azores, Belgium, Norway, Russia and Africa. But never to the infamous island, according to the logs. </p>

<p>That alone leads me to question  their validity, because I&#39;d wager Clinton has most likely been to that island before. I&#39;ll bet you&#39;d wager that too.</p>

<p>And like I said above, plenty of people have claimed themselves they flew on Epstein&#39;s plane but don&#39;t appear in the logs. </p>

I can only think about all the posts in years past that exposed something dark in Hollywood and were only met with down votes and people calling them liars. 
This one is a big one, so big that people have a hard time wrapping their heads around it. For me I have no problem believing this, From the things I&#39;ve read over the years and the research I&#39;ve conducted it really does sound plausible. This is real and hopefully the one that blows everything up and finally convinces people of the truth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s useless to respond unless one builds up some kind of copy-pasta bullshit the same way Pizzagaters do. But if we do, then we&#39;re called shills for putting effort into calling out your bullshit. It&#39;s a lose-lose situation. It happens to me all the time (I don&#39;t delete my comments and sometimes copy and paste previous comments).</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been called a &quot;pedo&quot;, &quot;shill&quot;, told to kill myself, etc. All because I looked at the evidence, just like Pizzagaters asked, and think it&#39;s complete bullshit.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Nevermind the 100% complete and total lack of evidence of a (pedo) crime. No witnesses, no victims, no paper trail, no crime scene. Literally, nothing.</p></li>
<li><p>Nevermind the fact that <strong>all</strong> the code words used in the emails were made up by some 4chan post</p></li>
<li><p>Nevermind the fact that every email Pizzagaters cling to are easily explained (the $65k email posted by OP is a classic example: Written by some blowhard Obama-hating Republican that calls Obama &quot;Hobama&quot; with no connection to the White House. Yet, it&#39;s somehow used as evidence of a crime against the accused.</p>

<p>It&#39;s been debunked hundreds of times, but Pizzagaters are still lying and posting about it. But you accuse anyone who points this out to be a shill.</p></li>
<li><p>Nevermind the fact that I get called names every time I point out the <strong>constant lies</strong> told by Pizzagaters.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>It&#39;s a shit theory, with shit proponents who call everyone who see through their bullshit names. Trying to argue against Pizzagaters&#39; bullshit is next to impossible when a bunch of PG circle-jerkers copy-paste all their shit, and call anyone who does the same, but disagrees, a &quot;shill&quot;. Again, it&#39;s lose-lose.</p>

<p>So your answer is that you have no idea, the phrase does not appear to be linked to any actual thing, and you&#39;re not even sure if the phrase actually is &quot;cum panda&quot; like you&#39;re assuming.</p>

You drove me to the point where I said have fun protecting elite pedophiles so now you can finally say you had me pegged correctly for SOMETHING, albeit something rather trivial.

    <div class="md"><p>Regular humans produce offspring or know others who have produced offspring. Regular modern humans often share photos of their offspring, especially when they do cute stuff. </p>

<p>For some reason, when you see regular humans doing this regular human behavior, you accuse them of being pedophiles. I hope that reason is because you&#39;re blinded by partisanship, and desire to blame democrats for everything, as petty as that is. However, I <em>fear</em> your reason may be that you&#39;re wrestling with urges and desires you know are not socially acceptable, not unlike the pattern of homophobic conservative politicians who get caught practicing homosexual acts.</p>

<p>When you see pictures of kids, your mind jumps straight to pedophilia.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s hoping you&#39;re just a dishonest partisan!</p>

ago, assume we are using the same channels? </p>

<p>Why is &quot;waitresses&quot; in quotation marks in the e-mail and &quot;what does assume we are using the same channels&quot; mean?</p>

<p>Well, &quot;finding a dead body in a room full of weapons where the shots originated&quot; is a bit more than suspicious. Any reasonable person in that situation would probably jump to the obvious conclusion. I think it&#39;s also safe to assume that forensics showed both that the guns (which had been legally purchased by Paddock) were recently fired, and that Paddock had gunpowder residue showing that he had recently fired guns. (I don&#39;t recall reading those specific details, but I&#39;d guess they&#39;re considered too obvious to report.)</p>

<p>Pizzagate alleges that specific politicians committed acts of pedophilia and child trafficking, without ever showing evidence that those crimes even happened. If you dig into my history and find a post where I talk about how much I want to steal the Mona Lisa (presumably using a secret code that you figured out with help from 4chan), it&#39;s not going to mean much as long as the Mona Lisa is still hanging there in the Louvre.</p>

<p>There&#39;s plenty to be suspicious about here. So either your definition of suspicious is very very defined to the cases you deem fit or your suspicion is targeted either on purpose or not. You can&#39;t logically look at the evidence posted and say &quot;nah nothing to see here&quot;. </p>

<p>But this message you&#39;re pumping of &quot;it won&#39;t go mainstream lol guy cause you have no evidence&quot; serves to undermine the power behind putting in the public eye for scrutiny.

<p>A real crime has real victims. Paddock killed exactly 58 actual people, with names and identities. How many victims does pizzagate have? Can you name any?

    <div class="md"><p>Is the blue vest different than your mona lisa tactic? The only difference is your mind is going to be blown later when you see it. </p>

<p>And you&#39;re still trying to discredit pizzagate by trying to paint its believers as people who simply &quot;assume too much&quot; when there is literally thousands of well thought out posts displaying evidence that is publicly available. This thread alone has enough information to bring you to the completely sound and logical conclusion that we should be suspicious and that some action has been taken. </p>

<p>Please kind sir who questions everything yet offers nothing of substance take one of the logic strings used to verify pizzagate and offer contradictory information. President Obama drop in your response is some gold level baiting to splinter this discussion even  more. Asking for an exact number of verified victims to say that this at least deserves some suspicion and attention is flat out just insane and never used when investigating. </p>

<p>I hope that whether you serve willingly, knowingly or unwillingly and unknowingly you see the true face of your masters here. </p>

<p>Last line is also bait to personal insult when were discussing a topic .</p>

<p>Can you offer a contradictory explanation for those oh so silly emails about having minors in a pool? and if you can&#39;t why do you push the message that this cant and wont go public? Your answer is &quot;no real evidence&quot; &quot;not really suspicious&quot; &quot;please give me accurate victim counts and living victims with experiences&quot;- all you have to do to recognize how real this is, is look at Hollywood.

<p>That email actually gives the names and ages of three children: &quot;Ruby, Emerson, and Maeve Luzzatto.&quot; Since you&#39;ve known for over a year the identities of three real-life victims, surely by now you&#39;ve located those children and gotten their testimony against their evil, child-prostituting grandmother, right? I mean you wouldn&#39;t just sit around for a year while these very specific kids are being passed around as party favors.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think I need to tell you which. Either way time will tell. Given what&#39;s happened in Hollywood recently and what&#39;s very very clearly unfolding there- wouldn&#39;t you like to revisit your assumption?</p>

<p>Do you genuinely believe people who followed pizzagate went for a casual look at one link or a video and said &quot;man I&#39;m sold&quot;. Then came here to post in defense of shilling tactics, in essence making themselves targets for ridicule and possibly putting them in danger (depending how tinfoil you are). </p>

<p>Misinterpretation is another logical fallacy. You&#39;re saying &quot;you just read it wrong&quot; its a party invite either way- but giving ages and outlining the email the way they did seems very very specific almost like something you wouldn&#39;t say for a normal party? I&#39;ve never done that with any invite. </p>

<p>The effort you guys put in to coming here to &quot;debunk&quot; by insulting and using logical fallacies to draw away from the issue are highly suspicious. The rules of the board prohibit me taking my comment further than that. </p>

<p>&quot;surely by now you&#39;ve located victims to testify&quot;. Same exact line as before. And you&#39;re attacking my person again by saying I&#39;m illegible now. You&#39;re literally just spouting stuff from a list and offering nothing of value. Shame on you Charlie.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In what way are you explaining any of the questions mentioned by OP?  Yea so trump acts immature sometimes but guess what Timmy, so do you with the “But..but...somebody said something about trump doing some bad things to”  Sounds like a 2nd grader level comment.  By the way many of us don’t trust trump either and if he is involved then we need to get him to.. but like him or not you should have saved that ignorant comment because it is very revealing as to your intelligence level and/or your motive here.  Is it because you have no response to OP questions that you make an Absolutely absurd and childish response about accusations against Trump that wether true or not are dwarfed by terrible facts in reference to kidnapping kids in Haiti and the terrifying evil content on alefantis IG.  That man should be investigated for the IG content alone!  How is it that you are so easily convinced Trump is guilty of so called accusations or anything else close to the level of kidnapping, trafficking, raping children but no matter how many facts, pictures, or dots that connect in relation to pizzagate you people refuse even consider it true.  </p>

<p>If I had never seen those IG pictures, podestas art, or heard the facts surrounding silsbys arrest and someone sat me down showed it to me,  the last thing that i would say in reference to this post is “but... but.. president trump said you can “grab a woman by the Pu$$y”.  (Which btw is not bragging about sexual assault as you exaggerated.  What he actually said was the if you have a lot of money you can grab a woman by the pus and she doesn’t care which nowadays is sadly true).  But, regardless of that trump comment It does not make it pizzagate okay or irrelevant and it makes no sense for someone to respond to those facts in that manner.  I hope you are a shill because if not something is wrong with you and your sidekick happyog.  It’s almost as if your trying to defend pizzagate suspects or somehow trying to distract.  </p>

<p>And for the record idgaf about Trump or trust him.  But tell me this how are you so matter of fact on trumps guilt but not pizzagate when the comparison of actual evidence for pizzagate crimes far outweigh your exaggerated claims of trumps crimes.  Further, if There was half of the amount of evidence out there for trumps guilt as there is pizzagate evidence and you pointed it out in a post the last effing thing I would say is “but.. but... Cruz watches porn on Twitter”  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s useless to respond unless one builds up some kind of copy-pasta bullshit the same way Pizzagaters do. But if we do, then we&#39;re called shills for putting effort into calling out your bullshit. It&#39;s a lose-lose situation. It happens to me all the time (I don&#39;t delete my comments and sometimes copy and paste previous comments).</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been called a &quot;pedo&quot;, &quot;shill&quot;, told to kill myself, etc. All because I looked at the evidence, just like Pizzagaters asked, and think it&#39;s complete bullshit.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Nevermind the 100% complete and total lack of evidence of a (pedo) crime. No witnesses, no victims, no paper trail, no crime scene. Literally, nothing.</p></li>
<li><p>Nevermind the fact that <strong>all</strong> the code words used in the emails were made up by some 4chan post</p></li>
<li><p>Nevermind the fact that every email Pizzagaters cling to are easily explained (the $65k email posted by OP is a classic example: Written by some blowhard Obama-hating Republican that calls Obama &quot;Hobama&quot; with no connection to the White House. Yet, it&#39;s somehow used as evidence of a crime against the accused.</p>

<p>It&#39;s been debunked hundreds of times, but Pizzagaters are still lying and posting about it. But you accuse anyone who points this out to be a shill.</p></li>
<li><p>Nevermind the fact that I get called names every time I point out the <strong>constant lies</strong> told by Pizzagaters.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>It&#39;s a shit theory, with shit proponents who call everyone who see through their bullshit names. Trying to argue against Pizzagaters&#39; bullshit is next to impossible when a bunch of PG circle-jerkers copy-paste all their shit, and call anyone who does the same, but disagrees, a &quot;shill&quot;. Again, it&#39;s lose-lose.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most of what you wrote is illegible nonsense, so I&#39;ll focus on this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Can you offer a contradictory explanation for those oh so silly emails about having minors in a pool?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That email actually gives the names and ages of three children: &quot;Ruby, Emerson, and Maeve Luzzatto.&quot; Since you&#39;ve known for over a year the identities of three real-life victims, surely by now you&#39;ve located those children and gotten their testimony against their evil, child-prostituting grandmother, right? I mean you wouldn&#39;t just sit around for a year while these very specific kids are being passed around as party favors.</p>

<p>...unless they&#39;re not victims at all, and that email was just a mundane party invitation that you and others have misinterpreted to fit a patently ridiculous political agenda. You tell me which.</p>
