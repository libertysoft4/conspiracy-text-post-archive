        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><em>June 14 2017</em>- 
Attorney General Jeff Sessions prepped 1500 members of law enforcement officers for the fight against sex trafficking during a motivational speech on June 6 at the National Law Enforcement Training on Child Exploitation in Atlanta.</p>

<p>Sessions said that through Trump’s executive orders, he’s directed the Department of Justice to reduce crimes especially on young people. “We will make the fight against child exploitation and human trafficking a top priority,” Sessions said.</p>

<p>Despite critics who claim the unprecedented increase in sex trafficking arrests aren’t due to Trump’s efforts, nothing could be further from the truth. I reported in February that during Trump’s first month in office there were a staggering 1500 plus pedophile arrests made. Since then, there have been well over 3000 arrests. Meanwhile, as I reported in March, the Russian conspiracy theory the left and globalists have pushed so hard is nothing more than a manufactured lie to distract from sex trafficking. The sex trafficking epidemic in the elite circles – dubbed Pedogate — is rampant. “This is so massive of a scandal it’s like Watergate on steroids,” the source said. “Everyone is distracted by fake news but this is the biggest scandal of the century and the truth will come out.”</p>

<p>On June 10, there is a 50 state demonstration to draw attention to the elite pedophilia problem. Our Children Matter – an organization created after the Podesta e-mails revealed the use of pedophile code words and terms according to their site — organized the nationwide march.</p>

<p>Navy Seal Craig Sawyer started the nonprofit Veterans for Child Rescue to go after the elite pedophile rings. Sawyer said he went independent since gatekeepers in the media aren’t interested in shining a light on this topic.</p>

<p>“One aspect of this, some of them are actually into Satanic rituals and torturing them to death…little infants and toddlers. It’s really hard to digest but I’m getting high-level information about it from federal law enforcement and the intelligence community.”</p>

<p>When the truth comes out about how rampant child sex trafficking is in this country, particularly among the elites, the public will remember the who had the courage to address this horrendous issue and who chose to turn a blind eye to the rape and torture of infants and kids. As Sawyer pointed out, thankfully we now have a President dedicated to stopping this evil that’s plagued our great nation for too long. “We’ve got a President now who’s not OK with children being raped and tortured to death so thank God,” Sawyer said.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Be wary of the disinformation trolls deployed to try and equalize the guy taking down the network with the monsters <em>in</em> the network.</p>

<h1>1) Though there&#39;s 100% documented proof that Bill Clinton flew on the Lolita Express with business partner and Clinton Foundation co-founder Jeffrey Epstein, and that Hillary went 6 times, there is NO documented proof that Trump ever went. There IS documented proof, however, that Trump banned Epstein from his club after he was hitting on underaged girls.</h1>

<p>2) The Trump &quot;locker room&quot; tape reveals two things: 1) That Trump liked age-appropriate women. In the recording, he talks about having a crush on a married woman; and how he bought her furniture to try and woo her. When she became aware of his feelings, she rebuffed him and he went away. He at no time attacked her, or forced himself on her. 2) In the second part of the recording, he talks about fame and how groupies throw themselves as celebrities. &quot;They&#39;d even let you grab them by the pussy&quot;. LET? But the media tole me it was &quot;non-consensual&quot; and that he was advocating FORCING himself on women?</p>

<p>No, Trump was talking about the existence of groupies.</p>

<p>The existence of groupies is NOT controversial . . . unless you&#39;re what? Amish?</p>

<p>Who doesn&#39;t believe that groupies exist?</p>

<p>It&#39;s why we have a term for it: star-fuckers. Women who want to sleep with celebrities so that they can brag about it later.</p>

<p>Paul McCartney: &quot;Groupies exist.&quot;</p>

<p>Media: &quot;Oh, my God! Beatle Paul is exactly like Harvey Weinstein!&quot;</p>

<p>No, that&#39;s why we have TWO separate terms: Groupies and &quot;the casting couch&quot;.</p>

<p>No one in the history of the world has ever confused the two.</p>

<p>Groupies = consensual</p>

<p>Casting couch = non-consensual</p>

<p>Groupies WANT to sleep with the celebrity.</p>

<p>Casting couch victims do NOT want to sleep with the non-celebrity moguls who force themselves on the women.</p>

<p>That Paul McCartney slept with groupies in no way, shape or form implies that he&#39;s Weinstein.</p>

<p>So this pathetic attempt at equalization by disinformation trolls is telling.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a reason why all these celebrities were unhinged, angry and sweaty when Trump got in. Why they took a Presidential election WAYYYyyyy too seriously. Why it seems personal for them.</p>

<p>&quot;If that bastard gets in, we all hang&quot;. --Hillary Clinton</p>

<p>So now the people targeted for exposure are sending out trolls to try and discredit the man taking down the network.</p>

<p>Nice try, trolls.</p>

<p>See you in jail.</p>

<p>To be honest, it still seems tame compared to some of the stuff I suspect goes on amongst the elite.</p>

<p>Similarly, I never read much into Trump&#39;s single flight on Epstein&#39;s plane. It&#39;s as though he went expecting one thing, discovered it was way more depraved than even he was into, and never went again.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People always seem to misrepresent trumps “grab em by the pussy” quote IMO.</p>

<p>What he actually said was more along the lines of “when you’re famous they let you do anything even grab them by the pussy”.</p>

<p>The important part for me is the “they let you but”. It implies consent. And from my knowledge of celebrity types it seems to be a statement of fact. Is anybody going deny that celebrities get more sex than normal people because of their celebrity status.</p>

<p>Consensual pussy grabbing between adults is nothing when compared to moloch worshipping pedophiles.</p>

<ul>
<li>Picking people for important positions who incredibly unqualified </li>
<li>leaving the Paris climate deal</li>
<li>His Tweet policy in general (with that I mean that he is using Twitter for topics that are way to important)</li>
<li>his handling of the terror attacks compares to each other</li>
<li>him being a racist</li>
<li>his constant verbal diarrhea </li>
<li>His constant lying  (especially when it comes to situations where it is unnecessary) </li>
<li>his behavior towards the press and his love for FOX News as the main source of information </li>

<p>So because one quote didn&#39;t say he was his best friend it&#39;s spun? </p>

<p>That&#39;s easy to prove. When Epstein&#39;s house was raided he had all of his dozen or so numbers in his Rolodex. When Trump played tennis tournaments at Mar-A-Lago he picked him as his partner.</p>

<p>But all you have to do is type something like this at the bottom:</p>

Msm are spineless twats. 
Every news anchor on CNN or nbc will think they are doing such a fabulous rewarding job reporting this stuff, and will expect a thank you.
We won&#39;t let them be thanked!! They avoided the truth for a long time, and KNEW this as going down and did nothing about it because of &quot;career suicide&quot;..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You actually think that Trump got elected, stepped into the DOJ offices and told them that from now on pedophiles should be arrested, and that resulted in 1500 arrests <em>a month</em> later? How long do you think it takes to collect evidence on 1500 people? two weeks?</p>

<p>The President has an important job but it&#39;s not like he&#39;s actually doing everything the government is doing. The President gets to allocate resources, in very broad terms, not to dictate how and when arrests happen. That&#39;s why I don&#39;t attribute these arrests to Obama either, even though work on this operation probably started during his term.</p>

<p>And yes, pedophiles and human traffickers getting arrested - and who the President is - has nothing to do with whether or not Weinstein has the power to keep his face off the NYT front page. There&#39;s literally nothing in common between an FBI crackdown on pedophiles or human traffickers and a powerful Hollywood figure being a sexual predator.</p>

<p>By the way, I&#39;m known for having good memory. Very good memory. The best memory, really. That&#39;s why I remember there used to be a sticky in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> about how the FBI is arresting operators of child pornography websites and then using the websites as traps to catch pedophiles. Everyone was going off about how everyone in the government is a pedophile, pizzagate confirmed. Several months later, 1500 pedophilia arrests. Pizzagate confirmed again. Some people have it coming and going.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Excellent points, yes these arrests would have taken time to put together.  </p>

<p>Of course trump isn&#39;t personally responsible for everything that&#39;s happening, but the head of the executive has a huge influence over military and law enforcement policy, and can create a sea change.  As chummy as the clintons were with spacey, Weinstein, etc, you don&#39;t think there would be a chilling influence against pursuing those kind of allegations in the media or law enforcement if Clinton were in the white house?  Media, political,  and law enforcement cooperation are essential to sexual predators as we have seen from the catholic church or scandals like Franklin S&amp;L.   Often times there are years-long investigations that go nowhere, and the executive has a huge influence on that. For example, Obama was beholden to powerful banking interests, and Holder&#39;s  do-nothing justice dept that continually refused to prosecute  was a direct result of that.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s why I said I would like to see a comparison between previous sex related arrests and those since trump took office.  I think it is possible that crimes were overlooked or not pursued aggressively during the interconnected Clinton, bush, and Obama administrations.  They are all connected to a lot of creepy events and sexual predators.  I understand that trump was friends with Epstein, and I assume that it&#39;s never mentioned only because Epstein is an even bigger liability to the Clintons.  But with the non-stop media assault on trump, I would think if he had other predator friends they would be uncovered by now.  It&#39;s very possible that trump and his political opponents aren&#39;t connected to the same group of predators and therefore pressure on law enforcement could be different now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see no reason to assume that Trump is fewer friends in Hollywood than the Clintons. </p>

<p>Both Trump and Bill Clinton are sexual predators of the kind that&#39;s now being purged from Hollywood. I&#39;ll remind you that Trump had like 20 women accuse him of sexual harassment, had an ex-wife accuse him of rape, and admitted pussy grabbing and going in dressing rooms. So I view this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I would think if [Trump] had other predator friends they would be uncovered by now</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As a little funny.</p>

<p>The bigger issue, though, is that stuff happens without the government&#39;s involvement all the time. Both the Weinstein expose and the pedophile arrests are examples. Most things about the economy, too. The healthcare market is a pile of poop not because of Trump, or Obama, but because of things that happened in the last 50 years or so.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I would like to see a comparison between previous sex related arrests and those since trump took office.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This would be less than informative. If Trump were a monster, and 2 months after his inauguration he strolled into the DOJ and told them not to start any more investigations into pedophilia, when would the effect be measurable? In 3 years? 5? I suspect that if less than 1500 pedophile arrests a day were made during Obama&#39;s tenure you&#39;ll see this as evidence of something about Trump, when in fact it&#39;s mostly evidence that a particularly successful FBI operation was started under Obama and was culminated under Trump, and nothing more.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol you had to go to someone else&#39;s comment in a separate child thread to come up with that? </p>

<p>Try to stay on topic. The person who replied to me in the thread you&#39;re in now said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And you&#39;re convinced that it is all coincidence, despite bilderberg meetings, wikileaks cables, the un&#39;s acknowledgment of Israel&#39;s treachery</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Etc etc. Which you&#39;re now contradicting in each reply. Hmm. </p>

<p>taken from the same source you posted. how dense are you?</p>

<p>Wow you really found a little cherry huh? </p>

<p>You&#39;re right. One guy&#39;s opinion saying this billionaire Trump totally isn&#39;t a pedophile like his friend is indicative of a standup dude.</p>

<p>Why my friends always tell everyone how much I&#39;m not a pedophile. I even typed that up on my resume. </p>

<p>We better not look into this again. </p>

<p>Oh but your lie still stands as a lie though. And this guy named Colonel_Chestbridge1 said the same exact talking points yesterday. And another guy before that.</p>

<p>It&#39;s almost like you&#39;re being fed this stuff lol.</p>
