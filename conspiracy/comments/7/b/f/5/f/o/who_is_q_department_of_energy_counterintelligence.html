        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">54</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2017-11-07 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/klondike1412.html">klondike1412</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>In 1999, there was a critical scandal with the Department of Energy leaking state secrets about nuclear weapons and long-range &amp; submarine-hunting radar to China. The [Wen Ho Lee scandal](<a href="http://www.wnd.com/2000/09/6706/">www.wnd.com/2000/09/6706/</a>). Bill Clinton went WAYYYY out of his way to personally defend him...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Of course, Clinton administration officials have never charged — on
the record — Wen Ho Lee with being a spy. They claim that the Cox
Committee and various media elite must have misunderstood their earlier
sworn testimony about his giving the People’s Republic of China the
secret of the W-88 back during the Reagan administration. They claim,
now, they only suspected him, then, of being a spy. That’s why they say
they took him off the W-88 project and assigned him to the Los Alamos
archiving project back in 1993.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.heritage.org/homeland-security/report/improving-security-the-department-energys-weapons-labs">This led to a massive push for fixing glaring security flaws at the DOE.</a> Long article, but necessary reading. The scandal went deep and they tried to <em>break apart the DOE</em> rather than fixing the problem. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Proposals first introduced by Senator Rod Grams (R-MN) in S. 896 and Representative Todd Tiahrt (R-KS) in H.R. 1649 would transfer the three key labs that still perform nuclear weapons work to a more secure setting within the Department of Defense (DOD). They also would redistribute many of the DOE&#39;s remaining non-weapons programs to other civilian agencies, privatize the power marketing administrations, and effectively shut down the DOE in recognition of its 25 years of ineffective operation and security lapses.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So what happened instead? The <a href="https://news.clearancejobs.com/2013/04/23/5-things-you-might-not-know-about-the-office-of-intelligence-and-counterintelligence/">DoE made two new counter-intelligence agencies</a>, one under their control, and one under NNSA (National Nuclear Security Administration) control. There was a sunset clause on their creation in 2000, and they were confirmed in 2010 to continue and be officially established. </p>

<p>Two counter-intelligence agencies? That is indicators of a serious problem. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Director of the Office of Intelligence and Counterintelligence <strong>is serious business</strong>.</p>

<p>Is the director of your intelligence agency quad-lingual?  Edward Bruce Held, former director of the Office of Intelligence and Counterintelligence is fluent in English, French, Japanese, and Mandarin.  His background is with the Central Intelligence Agency, where he served in many roles, to include a clandestine operations officer; Chief of Station in Asia, Latin America, and Africa; a special assistant to the National Security Advisor; and a special assistant to the Director of Central Intelligence. Before taking over the intelligence arm of the Department of Energy, he was Chief of Counterintelligence for Sandia National Laboratories at Albuquerque. </p>

<p><strong>Measures and Signatures Intelligence</strong> is an OIC specialty.</p>

<p>Nuclear proliferation and the movement of possible weapons of mass destruction is serious business, and the Office of Intelligence and Counterintelligence is at the forefront of that mission. Measures and signatures intelligence (MASINT) involves detecting and tracking chemical, nuclear, and biological material that might be used in WMDs. According to The Oxford Handbook of National Security Intelligence, the OIC has spent upward of $430 million to purchase and emplace nuclear sensors along international border crossings, with a focus on former Soviet states. Among the signatures for which they are looking include uranium, plutonium, nuclear reactor parts, and heavy water.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Gee, so if Uranium One led to a few thousand KG of Uranium leaving through Canada to Russia, I bet that is the department to track it. </p>

<p>And why was that department even created? Because <strong>Bill Clinton almost led to the demise of the DOE</strong>. Then Hillary Clinton goes on under Secretary of State to make an <strong>even worse error</strong>. The DoE at this point is literally being personally destroyed by one family, watching them spread nuclear weapons across the world while dismantling the US stockpile. </p>

<p>Understand the long history. Started in the 90&#39;s. Counter-intel created in 2000, but not really up and running until 2010. With a history of Bill Clinton leaking secrets to the Chinese, letting the Norks get nukes, and then Clinton leading more of the same for the Russians, Chinese, and Iranians...</p>

<p><a href="http://www.lasg.org/UPF/Bruce_Held_DNFSBhrg_10Dec2013.pdf">In 2013, after the short government shutdown, they apparently took out all the stops</a> and <em>shut down the Nuclear Weapons Complex</em>, does that mean the US was not nuclear capable when the government shut down?!?!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On October 7, the NNSA senior leadership team was at a loss on how to proceed in face of all the political and budgetary uncertainty. In the midst of at times heated debate, Don Cook, the head of Defense Programs observed quietly but firmly that NNSA&#39;s overriding responsibility to the American people was to assure nuclear safety and to fulfill that responsibility <strong>we needed to initiate an orderly shutdown of America&#39;s nuclear weapons complex. That is a weighty decision, never before taken.</strong> But everybody in the room instantly recognized the wisdom of Don&#39;s statement and that is what we did.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That sounds like the DOE pushing back <em>hard</em> to the US government messing with their funding. Shut down the government? Fine, if you can&#39;t fund the security of your nukes, we&#39;ll shut them down. The DOE is playing hard ball. They know they are holding Pandora&#39;s Box, which is basically already opened, and the US government doesn&#39;t seem to give a damn. </p>

<p>So what state is the DoE in at this point? Total internal war. Counter-intelligence to the max, trying to figure out what the hell is going on with their Uranium going missing and lack of funding to do anything securely. Even worse, they are dismantling their whole stockpile without the funding to even do it safely, let alone replace anything that needs replacing (no new nukes made since 1988, btw). </p>

<p>What does this story lead us to? An internal war of spies, who normally can turn a blind eye to corruption, but instead have it show up on their doorstep in the form of their technology being stolen thanks to corrupt politicians (Bill Clinton), threatening to be shut down thanks to poor security, getting funding for counter-intelligence instead, then shortly after getting that funding, having the <em>exact same fucking family</em> sell their Uranium again. First case was China (with tech likely sent to North Korea), next case was Russia (and later possibly China, Iran, and North Korea again) getting uranium. It looks like the Clintons are at a literal war with the Department of Energy, hence Clinton took the side of the Saudi&#39;s who are extremely anti-Fracking and pro-oil. Anti-Fracking? That&#39;s what the DoE is in control of, since it is the US&#39; biggest petro product. </p>

<p>What a crazy, strange story, involving the most unlikely agency I would have expected... But I think the spies put nuclear safety over politics and engaged a detailed counter-intelligence operation using the National Geospatial Agency (who they would have worked with to form their Measures and Signatures Intelligence, which relies on similar world-wide mapping). </p>

<p>Spies versus spies. The new spies aren&#39;t necessarily in anyones best interest, but at least they aren&#39;t letting nuclear weapons get into the hands of everyone worldwide...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>because U1 also owns mines in kazakhstan, which russia wanted for what i think should be incredibly obvious reasons.</p>

<p>i don&#39;t mean to be offensive when i say this, but i think you should try getting your news from somewhere besides breitbart and sean hannity, as everything you are saying is wildly misinformed and reaks of propaganda.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>that we import more uranium from russia than all uranium exports combined, that none of that uranium has made it&#39;s way to russia, that russia bought U1 so they could get their hands on the mines in kazakhstan, and that U1 is a canadian firm that holds leases to known uranium deposits</p>

    <div class="md"><p>you must be misunderstanding what im saying then. first of all i never said any u.s uranium ended up in russia. you just keep saying none of the uranium went to russia as if thats fact. if you have a source id love to see it but as it stands i repeat its entirely plausible someone who owns half of a uranium mining company that has mines in the u.s might have access to some of that uranium. maybe the russians didnt take any of it to the motherland, thats totally possible too. maybe they just didnt want us to have it. but the key point im making is we who are not privvy to every damn deal u1 has made cannot account for all of the uranium they have mined.</p>
