    <div class="md"><p>They at the very least had specific knowledge about the details of the attack and purposely failed to pass on that information to the US. Hezbollah has been blamed for the attack yet we all know Israel created Hezbollah to counter the PLO. Here is a quote from a book written by a former member of Mossad.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the summer of 1983, this same informant told the Mossad about a large Mercedes truck that was being fitted by the Shi&#39;ite Muslims with spaces that could hold bombs. He said it had even larger than usual spaces for this, so that whatever it was destined for was going to be a major target. Now, the Mossad knew that, for size, there were only a few logical targets, one of which must be the U.S. compound. The question then was whether or not to warn the Americans to be on particular alert for a truck matching the description.
The decision was too important to be taken in the Beirut station, so it was passed along to Tel Aviv, where Admony, then head of Mossad, decided they would simply give the Americans the usual general warning, a vague notice that they had reason to believe someone might be planning an operation against them. But this was so general, and so commonplace, it was like sending a weather report; unlikely to raise any particular alarm or prompt increased security precautions. In the six months following receipt of this information, for example, there were more than 100 general warnings of car-bomb attacks. One more would not heighten U.S. concerns or surveillance.
Admony, in refusing to give the Americans specific information on the truck, said, &quot;No, we&#39;re not there to protect Americans. They&#39;re a big country. Send only the regular information.&quot;
At the same time, however, all Israeli installations were given the specific details and warned to watch for a truck matching the description of the Mercedes.
At 6:20 a.m. on October 23, 1983, a large Mercedes truck approached the Beirut airport, passing well within sight of Israeli sentries in their nearby base, going through a Lebanese army checkpoint, and turning left into the parking lot. A U.S. Marine guard reported with alarm that the truck was gathering speed, but before he could do anything, the truck roared toward the entrance of the four-story reinforced concrete Aviation Safety Building, used as headquarters for the Eighth Marine Battalion, crashing through a wrought-iron gate, hitting the sand-bagged guard post, smashing through another barrier, and ramming over a wall of sandbags into the lobby, exploding with such a terrific force that the building was instantly reduced to rubble.
A few minutes later, another truck smashed into the French paratroopers&#39; headquarters at Bir Hason, a seafront residential neighborhood just two miles from the U.S. compound, hitting it with such an impact that it moved the entire building 30 feet and killed 58 soldiers.
The loss of 241 U.S. Marines, most of them still sleeping in their cots at the time of the suicide mission, was the highest single-day death toll for the Americans since 246 died throughout Vietnam at the start of the Tet offensive on January 13, 1968.
Within days, the Israelis passed along to the CIA the names of 13 people who they said were connected to the bombing deaths of the U.S. Marines and French paratroopers, a list including Syrian intelligence, Iranians in Damascus, and Shi&#39;ite Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah.
At Mossad headquarters, there was a sigh of relief that it wasn&#39;t us who got hit. It was seen as a small incident so far as the Mossad was concerned — that we had stumbled over it and wouldn&#39;t tell anybody. The problem was if we had leaked information and it was traced back, our informant would have been killed. The next time, we wouldn&#39;t know if we were on the hit list.
The general attitude about the Americans was: &quot;Hey, they wanted to stick their nose into this Lebanon thing, let them pay the price.&quot; For me, it was the first time I had received a major rebuke from my Mossad superior, liaison officer Amy Yaar. I said at the time that the American soldiers killed in Beirut would be on our minds longer than our own casualties because they&#39;d come in with good faith, to help us get out of this mess we&#39;d created. I was told: &quot;Just shut up. You&#39;re talking out of your league. We&#39;re giving the Americans much more than they&#39;re giving us.&quot; They always said that, but it&#39;s not true. So much of Israeli equipment was American, and the Mossad owed them a lot.</p>

<li><p>I&#39;m not going to quibble with you over whether something like a question is anti-semitic or not. When the Talmud more or less says that its ok to rape gentile women and not Jewish women, its a perfectly valid question to ask. Nobody cares if you think its anti-semitic, seriously.</p></li>
