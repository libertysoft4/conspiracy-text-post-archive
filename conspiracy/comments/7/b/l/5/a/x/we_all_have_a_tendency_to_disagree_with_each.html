        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I think we all have experienced &quot;that guy&quot; who just has to disagree with what you think. Even if 98% of everyone else agrees, there&#39;s always one or two that don&#39;t.</p>

<p>Sometimes they&#39;re good at explaining things and you come to understand their point of view. But sometimes, they do/say something that pisses you off... which tends to get in the way of seeing things their way.</p>

<p>So you can&#39;t see what they&#39;re getting at. Or you just don&#39;t want to. What they&#39;re saying just seems like total crap. But just because things look one way at first, doesn&#39;t mean there&#39;s no other way of seeing things.</p>

<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/comments/7bi3pn/there_are_16_circles_in_this_image/?st=j9r1j480&amp;amp;sh=0b555fd8">Here&#39;s a pic</a> that serves as an awesome example.</p>

<p>I looked at it and figured it must be some kind of meme or inside joke. Then I checked out one of the comments and went back and looked at the pic again. The pic is what it is. If you can see those circles, you know they&#39;re just as much there as the squares are. The only thing that changes (and allows you to &quot;flip btw squares and circles) is your own perception and how you choose to focus it.</p>

<p>So next time, if you can&#39;t see how someone else&#39;s theory or explanation makes any sense, just remember they may be seeing the circles while you&#39;re looking at the squares.</p>

<p>Wouldn&#39;t you rather be able to see both?</p>

<p>Edit: I think the reason you tend to see squares first (and more easily) is because the shading of the lines adds an impression of depth, whereas the circles don&#39;t have this. Depth cues = visual processing priority over non-depth cues?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And this is why similar definitions and understandings of them are needed, because if we&#39;re talking about defined shapes, there are only squares. There are several squares in which an entire unified solid color is defining its shape with borders. There are no circles if we use this same understanding, as no circles are drawn out. </p>

<p>relating to the idea of disagreement.  here&#39;s the thing.  what is communication?  it&#39;s mutual agreement on terms.  it starts with that seed - common language - which is just agreement on terms.  if you have a more complicated idea to express and you can&#39;t find agreement, you just have to break the idea down into its components and find agreement on how you&#39;d both describe the components.  rinse repeat.  keep doing this until you have agreement on what you are describing.  </p>

<p>communication is the process of finding agreement of terms.  </p>

<p>how can you communicate effectively?  be accurate in your language.  </p>

<p>the root of most disagreement is poor communication.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know what’s interesting? My first glance was dismissive - I didn’t want to spend time getting trolled looking for circles that weren’t there. However, for some reason, I trusted that you said there WERE circles, so I changed my perspective, literally and figuratively and looked for a crumb- any curved lines. Voila! They popped into view. </p>

<p>I think most of us are here because we are skeptical. That is a blessing and a curse. Trust is a precious commodity. </p>

<p>Interesting exercise. Thanks. </p>

<p>However, there are SOME people who will disagree with you not because their perception is different, but because they like standing out. Attention-seeking.</p>

<p>Important to tell the difference between who genuinely has a different perspective and who just likes being difficult. </p>
