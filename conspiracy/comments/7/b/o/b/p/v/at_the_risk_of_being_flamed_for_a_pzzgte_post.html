    <div class="md"><p>I agree and I was a bit harsh skimming over your second comment.</p>

<p>The way the events happened a week apart tells me they were related in some way, and not in the witch hunt sort of way. It&#39;s as if someone ordered the sub to be shut down and a false flag shooting at the same time. But that would be crazy tin foil hat speak wouldn&#39;t it.</p>

<p>I believe so. When it went to Voat it got bigger. Google search index filled up with even more Pizzagate. The shooting effectively forum slid a bunch of that nasty stuff off the front pages of Google search, while at the same time conflating conspiracy theorists with gun toting whackjobs in the MSM. Real question is, who applied the pressure on the admins? Was it a lawyer representing Comet? I wonder...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When you&#39;re right you&#39;re right. I didn&#39;t look into pizzagate until after the shooting. I just looked up the actual dates. It was taken down on 11/24/16. Shooting was 12/05/16. The reason for taking it down was</p>

<p>&quot;For those not familiar with the movement, the &quot;Pizzagate&quot; subreddit was started by a group of Trump-supporting internet sleuths who were attempting to use WikiLeaks&#39; leaked Podesta emails to connect the Clintons and John Podesta to the convicted sex offender, Jeffrey Epstein.  That said, when the Podesta emails failed to reveal a &quot;smoking gun&quot; linkage, the sleuths instead turned their focus to mulitple &quot;pizza&quot; references in Podesta&#39;s emails which then led to the speculation that those &quot;pizza&quot; references must be code for something far more sinister.&quot;</p>

<p>I found it to be a strange explanation on what it was. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pizzagate is pedogate. Pizzagate was a psych op to discredit pedogate researchers. Plenty of reporters have died investigating human trafficking.

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Anon claimed to have hacked the encrypted part of CPP&#39;s website (<a href="https://ibb.co/hOjnyG">https://ibb.co/hOjnyG</a>), found CP (images and movies) and reported it to DCMP. The CPP network included 9 different servers across the globe, including Berlin, Germany. It appears the files were able to be sold through CPP. Shortly after the report was made, the false flag occurred (magically shooting CPP&#39;s hard drive). After the false flag, Anon spoke to Det. Marcus Stevens at DCMP and reporting his findings, offering to help DCMP in any way. CP cannot be disseminated, so Anon had to describe what he found and how. After about a month, Stevens stop communicating.
Given the lack of interest by DCMP, Anon turned to the FBI, DHS, and the NYPD. No agency pursued the report, however, Anon said NYPD was interested but inferred their hands were tied. In desperation, Anon went to the press. Some media people claimed interest (FOX 5), but implied they couldn&#39;t cover the story.
During the time Anon reported what he found, his mail was opened and a prowler was found outside his house, hiding in the bushes. The suspect lived two states away and was charged with vehicle prowling. In addition, some of his property was damaged in a separate incident. Anon said he lives in a good, quiet neighborhood</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been trying to find that thread that initially had the Wethepizza.com hack and literally posted the evidence in that thread. However it was quickly deleted. You will find the Guy #2 disinfo post (in my opinion disinfo) and people referencing the first post, but not the goods people really want.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok so two thoughts.</p>

<p>A. CPP is a gateway to CP and other criminal pedo activity</p>

<p>or</p>

<p>B. A honeypot/sting opp that we uncovered. </p>

<p>Either way, that&#39;s why the MSM covered it up and never investigated. </p>

<p>If A. TPTB are behind it and some very powerful people are involved who can pull strings w/ DC police investigations (remember Seth Rich)</p>

<p>B. The govt/fbi/sting opp is blown and they are just trying to minimize the damage to ongoing investigations.</p>

<p>Why I think it&#39;s a criminial conspiracy not a govt opp is that they brought in all the most vile people who willingly became involved and then JA gets invited to the WH to play ping pong w kids there w/ Obama???  That&#39;s not a good &quot;cover story&quot; for a honey pot opp.</p>
