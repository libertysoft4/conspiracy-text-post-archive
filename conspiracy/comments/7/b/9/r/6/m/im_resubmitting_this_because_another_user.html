        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><em>People of Interest:</em></p>

<p>(This list is a bit hard to follow because of the long names.  This chart : <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/a-whos-who-of-the-saudi-royal-family-2015-2">http://www.businessinsider.com/a-whos-who-of-the-saudi-royal-family-2015-2</a> will help you clarify who is who.)</p>

<p>King Abdulaziz Ibn Saud (King Saud.  Deceased) :  King of Saudi Arabia (1932-1953)</p>

<p>King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz Al Saud (Deceased) :  5th son of King Saud.  King of Saudi Arabia until his death in 2015. Successor is King Salman</p>

<p>Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud (Henceforth King Salman):  Current King of Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA).  8th son of deceased King Abdulaziz Ibn Saud.</p>

<p>Mohammad bin Salman (Henceforth Crown Prince Mohammad):  Son of King Salman.  Currently next in line to be king after King Salman.</p>

<p>Muqrin bin Abdulaziz (Former Deputy Crown Prince.  Henceforth Muqrin) :  9th son of deceased King Abdulaziz Ibn Saud.  Was next in line to be king if King Salman had died before being crowned king.  IS THE FATHER OF Mansour bin Muqrin bin Abdulaziz Al Saud!  THE MAN KILLED IN THE HELICOPTOR CRASH ON 11/5/2017.</p>

<p>Mansour bin Muqrin bin Abdulaziz Al Saud (Henceforth Mansour) :  Son of Muqrin bin Abdulaziz.  Died 11/5/2017, the day of the failed coup on the throne of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.  </p>

<p>Alwaleed bin Talal (Henceforth Talal) :  Billionaire businessmen.  Grandson of King Saud.  Has ties to DNC, Clinton, Podesta.  Arrested 11/4/2017 for corruption.  Owns The Four Seasons at Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas (Four Seasons occupy the top floors of Mandalay Bay)   Owns shares in Twitter as well as other high-tech silicon valley companies. Has had spats with Trump in the past.</p>

<p>I know that&#39;s a mouthful of names, but bear with me.  Just remember 4 names: Salman, Mohammad, Muqrin, and Mansour.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Do you remember how President Trump visited Saudi Arabia back in May of 2017?  Do you remember how warmly he was greeted by King Salman?  I do.  It was a spectacle.  Why was he greeted so welcomingly?  After all, President Obama&#39;s reception was... shall we say, less than grand.  Do you remember how after Trump&#39;s visit, Saudi Arabia started becoming more open in their policies?  Women can drive there now.  Did you notice how the Syrian rebellion became quiet?  Did you notice how quickly ISIS was crushed after the visit?  Why did Saudi Arabia suddenly want to get their oil companies listed on the NYSE?   What could have caused this? </p>

<p>To answer this, we have to look a little further back.  Back to around 2010.</p>

<p>It all goes back to fracking.  You see, the Kindom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) has always relied heavily on its vast petrol reserves for wealth and prosperity.  And they were ruthless.  OPEC.  The cartel of gasoline.  You can&#39;t count the number of times throughout history that OPEC used its power to crush governments, manipulate prices, control supplies, and fund activities.  If there ever was a international group of bullies, OPEC was it.  And at the head of this organization was the mighty KSA.  </p>

<p>Then came the fracking boom.  Suddenly, the world was no longer at the mercy of OPEC.  This made them nervous.  So, they did what they always do.  They pumped out more petroleum, driving the price of gas to lowest in decades.  What was their objective?  To bankrupt these fracking businesses.  KSA is rich.  Very rich.  They figured, we&#39;ll just drive gas prices unbelievably low and take the loss until all these fracking business startups crumble.  Do you remember how cheap gas got between 2013-2016?  It was ridiculous, wasn&#39;t it?  But what they didn&#39;t count on was just how cheap fracking had become.  So many of these business didn&#39;t go bankrupt.  So they took another step.  To convince the world that fracking was bad for the environment.  So they lobbied and supplied funds to the Democratic party.  Why?  Because the leftist are usually the ones who support ANY and ALL environmental regulations.  Do you remember all the legal battles that fracking had to go through?  Hell, it&#39;s still illegal in most blue states.  Do you now understand why the Saudis donated so much money to the Clinton campaign?  She was HEAVILY favored to win and if she did, you can bet your ass that illegalizing fracking would have been on the top of her list, returning us to dependence on arab oil.   But... this didn&#39;t work either.  Fracking continued.  And then, a shitstorm of reality hit them hard.  </p>

<p>You see, KSA had vastly underestimated the amount of total shale reserves in North America.  They had no idea that so much of this stuff exists.  They thought maybe they could ride it out if the reserves would dry up in a decade or so.  But nope.  We have enough shale to supply us for at least 50 years.   Hmmm... big problem.</p>

<p>So, if you&#39;re King Salman, what do you do?  Well, there&#39;s only one thing you can do.  Give up the reliance on oil production and try to use existing wealth to stay wealthy.  To modernize its trade to include more than just exports of oil.  They would need to build an entire industrial country from scratch.  To do that, he needed the help of the USA.  And that&#39;s where President Trump comes in.</p>

<p>You see, the May 2017 meeting between Trump and King Salman (and his son Mohammad), was not just another meeting.  It was a business meeting.  King Salman asked Trump for help.  Trump was more than willing to give it (like listing the oil companies on the NYSE) but his help would come with a price.  Liberalization and the stop of illegal funding.  No more contributions to American politics.  No more supplying funds to terrorists or splinter groups.  King Salman took the deal.  All of a sudden, women were allowed to drive.  ISIS was retreating.  Syrian rebels suddenly ran out of ammunition.  Yay.  All good up to this point.</p>

<p>Now comes the bad </p>

<p>Not all the royalties in KSA are into this.  They don&#39;t like losing the power they once had.  What&#39;s worse, they don&#39;t want to become liberal.  They now start resenting King Salmon.  They start plotting against him.  At the forefront of this movement is none other than the previous Deputy Crown Prince, Muqrin, and his son, Mansour (the man killed in the helicopter crash of 11/5/17).  </p>

<p>October 1, 2017.  The top floors of Mandalay Bay isn&#39;t Mandalay Bay, but is Four Seasons, owned by billionaire Talal.  Who was occupying that whole floor that night?  I can&#39;t remember where, but I heard that the whole floor was reserved for that week.  Now, no one would do that unless they were Saudi royalty.  We don&#39;t know for sure, but my guess is Crown Prince Mohammad.  We know it wasn&#39;t King Salman, because he was in Russia at the time. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/05/saudi-russia-visit-putin-oil-middle-east">https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/05/saudi-russia-visit-putin-oil-middle-east</a></p>

<p>The plan is to take out the crown prince.  Then kill King Salman.  With the King and the Crown Prince dead, who is next in line?  Yup.  The former deputy crown prince, Muqrin.  So, posing as terrorists who wanted to buy the guns for some terrorist attack, they dupe the CIA or FBI to supply the guns to the death squad.  Their real plan is to climb the stairs right after the deal and kill the VIP in the floors above them.  This is why the weapons cashe was located on the 32nd floor.  They would only have to climb a few stairs or take the elevator up a little to start the killing.  Now, here&#39;s what happened that night:</p>

<p>** With the post from u/kneejerk55, I have modified the events of the night.  I think it fits much better**</p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li><p>Paddock is the contact man to supply the guns.  He meets a couple of assassins ahead of time (remember, the shooting starts at 10:05).  At this point, Paddock is thinking this is a gun deal.  Only a few magazines are loaded.   He merely wants to show the customers how to load the chamber etc... What he doesn&#39;t know is that the advance team was sent to secure the floor.  That all but one entry point to the floor would be barricaded (crucial since the reason Campos becomes suspicious of the blocked doors is what ultimately leads him to investigate)  The reason for the barricade is that once the assault starts, the assassins want to make sure to impede the authorities as much as possible from reaching the top floors.</p></li>
<li><p>CIA/FBI (or Trump&#39;s own intelligence) got wind of the assassination that was about to take place.  Immediate action is taken to round up the assassins.  Remember, we&#39;re talking about an army of assassins here.  You can&#39;t kill a Crown Prince who&#39;s protected by 30 armed bodyguards by pulling a Jack Ruby.  I estimate at least 20 assassins in total.</p></li>
<li><p>What the assassins didn&#39;t know was that the prince had disguised himself as a regular dude to enjoy the nightlife in Vegas.  (Saudi princes have been known to do this)  He had slipped away from the Mandalay and was at the Tropicana playing some cards.  As soon as the FBI (or some other agency) learned of the assassination plot, they stormed the Tropicana and extracted the prince.  The video can be seen here. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVHmshtmDqo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVHmshtmDqo</a>  They lead him out of the casino and escort him to the nearest helipad to be picked up.  BUT, on the way, they encounter some resistance from a few assassins.  Hence the firefight at the airport.  Eventually, he makes it to the chopper and is whisked away. This explains the flight radar reports you see all over the net.  </p></li>
<li><p>Meanwhile, the FBI has gathered up as many of the assassins as they can.  A few are armed with sidearms.  They don&#39;t have rifles yet because the rendezvous with Paddock hasn&#39;t occurred yet.  Hence the random firefights at various casinos that night.  A few are killed.  Hence the Laura Loomer videos of covered up dead people.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oxAZIpSUuM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oxAZIpSUuM</a></p></li>
<li><p>The assassins already in Paddock&#39;s room gets a call.  They are told that the Prince is not in his suite above.  That he&#39;s being escorted out of the Tropicana.  They start panicking.  If they get caught in this plot to assassinate the crown prince, not only are they dead, but their employer is dead as well.  They come up with a plan.  They will kill Paddock and start firing on the crowd below.  They&#39;re gonna make him a crazy lone gunman.  So they kill Paddock.  They break a window.  They pick up a rifle and start firing at the crowd below.  After a couple of mags, they realize that the other mags aren&#39;t loaded!  Holy fuck.  They start reloading as fast as possible.  This is why the average time between bursts of fire is over 40 seconds.   One of them gets an idea.  Let me go to the other room and break that window and shoot at the fuel tanks at a nearby airport.  This will draw the police away from the Mandalay and they can escape.  So he goes and attempts just that.  Unfortunately, the tanks do not blow up.  By this time, Jesus Campos is knocking on the door.  So they just unload on him.  This is why there are (supposedly) 200 shots through the door.   Campos escapes a lethal shot and calls in security.</p></li>
<li><p>Now the assassins are getting nervous.  They realize that someone in the hotel knows that someone is firing.  They fire as much as they can.  They are thinking as soon as this barrage is done, we run.  But the swat team starts knocking on the door.  Fuck.  The assassins realize they&#39;re screwed.  So the first one shoots himself.  (This is the first of the single shots you hear at the end).  The second assassin isn&#39;t so sure.  He doesn&#39;t want to die.  So after 10 seconds of courage gathering, he shoots himself as well.</p></li>
<li><p>The SWAT team bursts in and finds 3 bodies.  They start asking questions.  But because the FBI is already there (remember, they extracted the prince) they take over.  They quickly assess the situation.  They realize the implications.  They remove the 2 assassins bodies, take a picture of Paddock lying there, and release it to 4chan to solidify their narrative.</p></li>
<li><p>Paddock is made the patsy.  Why?  Because if a failed Saudi assassination attempt was responsible for the deaths, if the FBI/CIA had supplied the guns that killed 58 innocent people (not counting Paddock since he&#39;s an asset), then two things would happen.  One, we would demand that we go to war with Saudi Arabia.  And two, which ever organization that Paddock worked for would be utterly dismantled.  </p></li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>Wew lads, I know.  Quite a story.  Now, let&#39;s fast forward to one month later.</p>

<p>We know a missile was intercepted by the Saudi military on November 3 or 4th.  This was probably the final effort by the anti King Salman group.  This was their last ditch effort to kill him.  OR, it was staged to give King Salman the excuse to round everyone up in retaliation of the assassination attempt.  We know that MASSIVE raids and the rounding of Saudi princes took place on the 5th.  I will guarantee you that all these people are anti Salman/Mohammad.  And who was just killed?  Yes.  The son of Muqrin, Mansour.  Mansour&#39;s death was retaliation.  I have no doubt of it.  He was executed.</p>

<p>Ok, now that this has happened, what&#39;s next?  Well, my guess will be that we will learn all of the funding that has been coming out of Saudi Arabia for the past decade.  It will expose their connections to the DNC.  We will learn that they have been at the root of all the turmoil in the Middle East.  Then, they&#39;ll all be executed.   </p>

<p>Do I win the award for the longest post ever at <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>?  Thanks for reading.</p>

<p>P.S.  The story works just fine with Paddock as a private illegal guns dealer, meaning the FBI/CIA only helped to foil the assassination attempt.  He doesn&#39;t have to be working for an alphabet agency.  However, given the clues from his life style (or the utter lack of it), I&#39;m betting that he was an asset.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe people think that on /pol or 4-Chan, fewer people thinking that here. </p>

<p>Paddock was doing something wrong. Whether he did some of the  shooting or just supplied guns, he is not innocent. </p>

<p>But if he was some kind of Superman genius with incredible stamina and intellect for his age, why did he waste energy and take the risk of bringing in way more guns than he would ever need. Bulletin clips  are smaller than guns. Any shooter knows that more clips equals a higher body count. Did he think all 23 guns would jam? Fuck no.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What are you talking about?  How do you know that the crown Prince was not in Vegas?</p>

<p>Forming an educated narrative based on available information is not unfounded speculation. Not saying this is gospel, but this is an interesting narrative that makes more sense than the offical story.</p>

<p>Based on your last sentence, you do not have the capacity to form an independent idea.  This sub has a great number of critical thinkers that are only focused on finding truth, not supporting bias such as yourself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It also has a large amount of people who no matter what, will believe the official narrative without any question and shoot down anyone who questions it.  I agree the post was all speculation (with clear connections to facts in the case) but you quickly write off the fact that the Saudi&#39;s had nothing to do with it purely on your own completely move past the obvious connections that should be question. Not sure why race got brought in to this at all but let’s just acknowledge that a white male was involved and implicated as the guy responsible. That doesn&#39;t make all white dudes bad or mean that people would have a hard time accepting it. I&#39;m a white male and I&#39;m ashamed of where our country is currently but Vegas doesn’t have anything to do with race and the simple fact that you&#39;d make that statement means you inherently are a racist. You know what? That is your choice and it doesn&#39;t really matter to me and I respect you as a human being in spite of it.  The only things that do matter are the victims and their families. They deserve to know what happened and race has not one thing to do with it. </p>

<p>Real, honest, question... Do you really believe you could look the victim’s family members in the eye and tell them the official report is correct and 100% accurate? There is no house of cards; there is just OP’s explanation of the timeline with clear connections in the argument. If Bill Gates stood as much to gain or lose as the Saudi&#39;s then I would at least take a look in his direction to see if there was a connection. Not to mention you also just had another potential assassination attempt thwarted this week. </p>

<p>Since you only deal in facts lets address some. No speculation at all. What facts have the authorities given us? Stephen Paddock(white male since you are fascinated with that) broke a window rained fire down on concert goers and then shot himself. Now through the facts, such as unbiased third party video footage we&#39;ve come to find out there were two smaller caliber shots (I guess he missed the first time) that roughly line up with the official timeline of him shooting himself; subject to change. Also we know that there is not a single video of him entering and exiting the casino, because well... they said so. We know that almost every single person interviewed on the ground that night was sure that there were multiple shooters. That isn&#39;t some guy on the internet giving his speculation those were people at the concert. I know the immediate reaction is that this was a stressful environment and people didn’t know what was going on. To a man, almost every single one interviewed says they can’t understand why the official report pushes the single shooter narrative. </p>

<p>Our government stands a lot to gain and a hell of a lot to lose by letting the facts out to the public. I don&#39;t know what happened on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay but what I do know is that it didn&#39;t happen the way the official report says it did.  If you want to pretend that race has something to do with it or politics or anything other than the facts of the case then let’s hear your opinion, I along with a lot of other people would love to hear something come from the official report that addresses these concerns.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>See you ignore obvious answers because you believe there is a conspiracy. The multiple shooters based on sound thing was pretty readily explained by acoustics. Multiple shooters on the ground is also easily explained by the sheer chaos of the area. Thousands of people fleeing while people are getting shot from some unknown location. If paddock was sweeping side to side it could totally look like bullets were coming from multiple places. </p>

<p>Also you should put this same effort in to your real life. Might amount to something. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It really doesn&#39;t. Mandalay Bay 4 seasons, which those people own a share of. No one has yet proven they own <em>that particular</em> location. Also, they&#39;re rich, I mean ungodly rich, without owning it, they could simply buy all the rooms for whatever nights they want. But so can any other insanely rich people.</p>

<p>Also, the idea of the mass shooting as a distraction really makes no sense, at least not from the same location as the &quot;assassination&quot; attempt.. and this location is the sole link they are trying to make.</p>

<p>Now, think about that. They try to bring in another hotel that has zero links (that they claim) as the location the prince or whoever is supposed to be, by simply claiming a video we&#39;ve all seen that doesn&#39;t prove anything.</p>

<p>And they even mentioned &quot;Trump&#39;s intelligence agents&quot; like what? Did Congress create a new intelligence service for Trump behind closed doors, or is Trump privately paying for this? In either case, this sounds like something Hitler would do, and I don&#39;t see why anyone would take this seriously once they saw that said.</p>

<p>&quot;Wew lad&quot; is an indicator this is a trumpet, and they&#39;re just creating fan fiction trying to make Trump the smartest best president <em>ever</em>, when he had absolutely zero to do with it.</p>

<p>It all rests solely on these people supposedly owning the four seasons, while ignoring that insanely rich people from across the globe could have done this for a variety of reasons.</p>

<p>And it poorly explains why you&#39;d commit a mass shooting at the place you&#39;re supposedly trying to assassinate someone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First, I think you&#39;ve done a phenomenal job here. This is well-researched, highly informative and very creative. I too think KSA may have had something to do with the LV shooting, and would love to get behind this theory. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, this part here is pure fan fiction: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>You see, the May 2017 meeting between Trump and King Salman (and his son Mohammad), was not just another meeting.  It was a business meeting.  King Salman asked Trump for help.  Trump was more than willing to give it (like listing the oil companies on the NYSE) but his help would come with a price.  Liberalization and the stop of illegal funding.  <strong>No more contributions to American politics</strong>.  No more supplying funds to terrorists or splinter groups.  King Salman took the deal.  <strong>All of a sudden, women were allowed to drive</strong>.  ISIS was retreating.  Syrian rebels suddenly ran out of ammunition.  Yay.  All good up to this point.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No more contributions to American politics? You realize that <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/sheldon-adelson-gives-testimony-in-netanyahu-corruption-case/">this guy</a> is Trump&#39;s top donor, right? </p>

<p>And do you <em>honestly</em> think Trump had <em>anything</em> to do with Saudi Arabia allowing women to drive? C&#39;mon now...</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>I made the narrative pro conservative.  But my intention was not to make a right-wing explanation.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I didn&#39;t even interpret it as pro-conservative, TBH. I thought it was very fair and balanced, and for the most part, non-partisan. The only part that seemed biased to me was the paragraph I excerpted above, and not because it was pro-conservative or pro-Trump, but because it was too out-of-character for Trump, and therefore not believable. </p>

<p>We know objectively that Trump has no problem accepting donations tied to foreign interests. His top donor, Sheldon Adelson (who&#39;s married to an Israeli citizen, and who owns a free Israeli newspaper that&#39;s sole purpose is to disperse pro-Netenyahu propaganda, which he openly admits) has been extremely vocal about how his $30 million donation to Trump&#39;s campaign and inauguration were contingent upon Trump&#39;s promise to move the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem. And apparently, that&#39;s totally legal. </p>

<p>And, I&#39;ll be honest -- it definitely pisses me off that billionaires and oligarchs like Adelson have so much influence over how our tax dollars are spent, but ultimately, that&#39;s a larger systemic issue. But my anger is directed at the system that enables this to happen, rather than specifically directed at Trump, or at any other individual politician (regardless of party) who legally accepts donations tied to foreign interests. They all do it and Trump is no different. </p>

<p>For that reason, and based on his track record (in particular, the Adelson example mentioned above), it&#39;s completely out-of-character for him to tell Saudi Arabia &quot;No more contributions to American politics.&quot; He&#39;s a businessman, not a humanitarian, and doesn&#39;t claim otherwise. </p>

<p>There&#39;s also the fact that, AFAIK, Trump has never been a passionate advocate for women&#39;s rights (and I have no problem with beauty pageants, but Miss America is not about women&#39;s rights). Additionally, his campaign platform was about making America great again and putting America&#39;s needs first. Therefore, it&#39;s hard to believe he went to Saudi Arabia and passionately advocated for women&#39;s rights so convincingly that the Saudis agreed to fundamentally change their culture over night. Nothing to do with my personal feelings about Trump (of which, I honestly have none)... it&#39;s just that, it goes against what we know about him and what he claims to stand for. Championing women&#39;s rights in the Middle East has never been part of his agenda. </p>

<p>So, that was my issue with that paragraph. Nothing to do with it being pro-conservative or pro-Trump; just too OOC for me to believe. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I wanted to connect the dots.  Period.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>And I think you did this incredibly well. That&#39;s exactly what I was thinking as I read it -- just utterly impressed at how well you connected so many disparate dots. The Trump paragraph didn&#39;t seem like a dot though, and seemed more like some incompatible object, and threw the whole web of connections off for me. But, honestly, kudos on your stellar dot-connection skillz! </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m sorry that I made the post sound right winged.  It was not my intention.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Like I said above, I didn&#39;t even interpret it as right winged. It was the recharacterization of Trump that gave me trouble. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Having said that, I stand by what I said.  I truly feel that the DNC is compromised.  I think if you are going to support a party, you should know who controls that party.  If it is some foreign entity, you should know.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Completely agree. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I honestly feel that the left and right are both slaves of the overlords.  Hence my posts.  I think we should stop believing everything on the news, and start believing what people who we trust tells us.</p>

<li><p>&quot;Yea, the news are going to eat me alive if this comes out. So, you will, as a sign of good faith, provide me with something irregular, a token of goodwill, that you take my reform ideas serious. Something that guarantees that I stay out of the bad press. It will cost you something, but not money, and you will more then make the gray hairs back up when you see the first bank statement. If you look ood in the public eyes of america, it is amazing what you can do in terms of business. ERemember, you scratch my back, I scratch yours. &quot;</p></li>
<li><p>&quot;Okay, check this. You sir have a PR problem. That is something we have in common. your enemies will use it against you, and it blocks all that foreign aid, and good will. What you usually do, to dig off the water, is to grab a minor issue, something that you wanted to change for a long time, but couldn&#39;t, and then make it looj like this just happened to change not because you had allready 90 % changed it, but because the outside had aided you. Will make trhe outside think, holy heck, how much more like us could they be if they just kept being aided by us?&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>&quot;So, sir, you were as surprised as I was, right, that some close to you funded terrorist groups, correct? Against your personal wishes? You have these cobras in your bed, but no idea how to deal with them? Simple. The first step is to get them all out, and make sure your bed is cobra free. let me ask you, are you a traditionalist, that has to have a &quot;no right for women to drive&quot;? No? Perfect. What you do is, you use this to get rid of all the snakes. you take itr, and you whack it down. On the religious right. You make this a big point. IF no one speaks up, I ln back, and go, I wash my hands in innocence. Re-institute this  as you see fit. But if suddenly the traditionalists get so offended that they show their true colors, you know just what to do. JFK said the same when he attacked the fdeep state. They didn&#39;t like it, and he had meant it as a mission statement. You will make this as a tool to find out who the deep state is. &quot;</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>Could Melania and/or Ivanka had a role in convincing Trump to get that kind o women&#39;s rights deal? Could also be something thrown in there as a show of power from Trump/the US to other countries/agencies who would work out that the relaxation of anti-women laws was prt of a deal, not that he convinced them by advocating for th rights of women, but just said &#39;this is what you have to do as part of the deal&#39; and it could also be kind of showing off a US &#39;stamp&#39; on SA in terms of culture. A sort of calling card or secret &#39;fuck yoou&#39; that those in the know would understand. </p>

<p>Also, it could be that Trump said &#39;no contributions to US politicians except for me.&#39; And the stuff with ISIS etc could be Trump wanting to take credit at home for &#39;ISIS being on the run&#39; which they are always banging on about in press conferences. So I think the theory can work even with Trump&#39;s self-serving attitude.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The DNC most certainly is compromised but not in the way that you&#39;re suggesting. Hillary was very pro fracking and was said to have &quot;sold fracking to the world.&quot; Bernie, on the other hand, was solidly against fracking. </p>

<p>But Hillary def did have a connection to Saudi Arabia. How does Huma Abedin fit into this? Which one of these guys was paying the Podestas $140,000 a month while John Podesta was chairperson of Hillary&#39;s campaign?</p>

<p>Her actual words are extremely different</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I don’t support it when any locality or any state is against it, No. 1. I don’t support it when the release of methane or contamination of water is present. I don’t support it — No. 3 — unless we can require that anybody who fracks has to tell us exactly what chemicals they are using.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So by the time we get through all of my conditions, I do not think there will be many places in America where fracking will continue to take place. And I think that’s the best approach, because right now, there are places where fracking is going on that are not sufficiently regulated.&quot;</p>

<p>But then again, her actions and words rarely matched.</p>

<p>I think we should stop believing everything on the news, and start believing what people who we trust tells us.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I know it&#39;s a bit belated, but honest question here...</p>

<p>What are you supposed to do if you literally don&#39;t trust or believe a single damn thing or person about, well, anything? </p>

<p>Just not care?</p>

<p>I&#39;m by no means a conspiracy theorist, I don&#39;t even know wtf I&#39;m doing here. But I do know that LV shooting was more confusing than just about any of the tragic news I&#39;ve woken up to 15 years of adult life. And your &quot;theory&quot; is... well-written if nothing else. I just think everyone&#39;s completely full of shit. Probably even you, even if your motives are unknown even to you.</p>

<p>Trump&#39;s full of shit. America is full of shit. China is full of shit. My government is DEFINITELY full of shit. The terrorists are completely full of shit (come the fuck on nobody loves their god that much - are they just sick of living in the sand? I don&#39;t fucking know). Hell, I&#39;m probably full of shit saying everyone is full of shit.</p>

<p>I want to believe you. Or somebody. Or something. But I don&#39;t think the &quot;truth&quot; even exists anymore. There&#39;s your truth. Or America&#39;s truth. Or Trump&#39;s truth, or something like that, I guess? But &quot;the truth&quot;? If I would go to the grave saying Scenario A is the truth, and you would go to the grave saying Scenario B is the truth, then ultimately, at the end of the day, once the dust settles, aren&#39;t both truths going to the reality anyway?</p>

<p>Fuck this, I&#39;m gonna have a billy and go back to playing Initial D. Sick post though.</p>

<p>You&#39;re probably right to an extent, but I can hear Trump saying something like &quot;Now look, Prince, no one knows the American people like I do.  Believe me.  And look, I can&#39;t do big deals with your country if your going to keep going around executing chicks for driving or something silly like that, OK?  It would be a total disaster for everyone.

    <div class="md"><p>This is what bothers me. I&#39;ve been a conspiracy theorist for decades, because when I was relatively young I was exposed to programs and facts that made it clear that SOME conspiracy theories were true, or at least there was substantial evidence to believe that they were true.  </p>

<p>As I got older and read more and gained an education, I continued to be interested in certain conspiracy theories that appeared to be justified by the facts. My main interest has always been in knowing the truth, and convincing others of the truth, insofar as I understand it. And the reason for that is that I believe the world can be a better place if government secrets are brought to light.  </p>

<p>That&#39;s why I came to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, under a different name, many years ago. There was always a lot of fluff, but there was genuine insight as well.  </p>

<p>Lately, not so much. What I see is a trend towards either (a) blind acceptance of anonymous fan fiction, which is bad, or (b) willingness to go along with fan fiction that isn&#39;t backed by evidence and logic because doing so is exciting. This is the opposite of the search for truth.  </p>

<p>So, I don&#39;t know what to think. I think some of the posts may be intentional misinformation. But that misinformation would never gain a foothold if real users didn&#39;t upvote it and continue to spread it around. </p>

<p>And when you question a theory you&#39;re hit with &quot;why are you even in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>?&quot;.  Sorry for not blindly believing every theory without evidence.

I understand you&#39;re trying to fill in the blanks with what&#39;s available but you jump to a lot of conclusions.  Instead of deferring to the most likely/reasonable scenario you tend to do the opposite.  It&#39;s one thing to believe these things as a hunch but to present them as fact or even likely is disingenuous.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>King Salman asked Trump for help. Trump was more than willing to give it</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To start, your first few paragraphs about Trump and Salman are pure speculation.  Your main evidence is women being allowed to drive and the implication that SA was funding both ISIS and the rebels fighting ISIS but stopped doing so because Trump promised to help with something.  So Trump gets what?  And Salman gets what?  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I can&#39;t remember where, but I heard that the whole floor was reserved for that week. Now, no one would do that unless they were Saudi royalty. We don&#39;t know for sure, but my guess is Crown Prince Mohammad</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Pure speculation.  Your entire premise hinges on this point and you don&#39;t know if it&#39;s true.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So, posing as terrorists who wanted to buy the guns for some terrorist attack, they dupe the CIA or FBI to supply the guns to the death squad. Their real plan is to climb the stairs right after the deal and kill the VIP in the floors above them. This is why the weapons cashe was located on the 32nd floor. They would only have to climb a few stairs or take the elevator up a little to start the killing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Really weirdly convoluted assassination plan, doesn&#39;t make any sense.  Why setup the arms deal?  Is this really the best plan a bunch of professional assassins could come up with?  A plan with close to 100% chance of being caught.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>CIA/FBI (or Trump&#39;s own intelligence) got wind of the assassination that was about to take place. Immediate action is taken to round up the assassins. Remember, we&#39;re talking about an army of assassins here. You can&#39;t kill a Crown Prince who&#39;s protected by 30 armed bodyguards by pulling a Jack Ruby. I estimate at least 20 assassins in total.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&quot;I estimate&quot;.  More pure speculation.  How did Trump/CIA/FBI get the intel RIGHT before it was supposed to happen?  How did you come up with the numbers of bodyguards and assassins?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They lead him out of the casino and escort him to the nearest helipad to be picked up. BUT, on the way, they encounter some resistance from a few assassins. Hence the firefight at the airport.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Assassins somehow find him?  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The assassins already in Paddock&#39;s room gets a call. They are told that the Prince is not in his suite above. That he&#39;s being escorted out of the Tropicana. They start panicking. If they get caught in this plot to assassinate the crown prince, not only are they dead, but their employer is dead as well. They come up with a plan. They will kill Paddock and start firing on the crowd below. They&#39;re gonna make him a crazy lone gunman. So they kill Paddock. They break a window. They pick up a rifle and start firing at the crowd below.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Explain to me how this makes any sense whatsoever.  Please.  How does firing on the crowd help them in any way? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Are you saying there&#39;s no proof that someone, tho we don&#39;t know who it was, was escorted out of the casino by 5 armed agents, all with automatic weapons drawn and AIMING at unarmed civilians?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This sorta happened but it&#39;s almost certainly not who you&#39;re claiming it is.  Where are his 25 other bodyguards?  Why are &quot;his bodyguards&quot; not surrounding him to protect him?  Why does he go a different direction than &quot;his bodyguards&quot;?  I&#39;ll just repost my other comment regarding the video since you didn&#39;t respond to that one:</p>

<p>Evidence:
1) man aims gun at unarmed people
2) guy in back is too nonchalant</p>

<p>Conclusions:</p>

<p>Must be a Saudi royal family member?
Is it more likely that these are poorly trained LV police being followed by 2 hotel employees? Or is it more likely that these are personal security escorting a Saudi prince (who apparently doesn&#39;t need the escort that badly because he separates from them at the end of the video)? If these were private security why wouldn&#39;t they have their VIP surrounded? Why would he just tag behind them?</p>

<p>Here&#39;s my understanding of your theory:  The CIA/FBI/whoever was going to sell guns to a group of assassins.  The assassins were actually there to kill a Saudi Prince.  The Saudi Prince is actually out gambling. The assassins then kill Paddock and start firing on the crowd(why?).  Some of the assassins somehow intercept Saudi VIP on way to helicopter and are killed. 2 assassins left in hotel are killed and everything is covered up.</p>

<p>If you were A LOT less specific it would be somewhat believable.  But as is it makes absolutely no sense.  Re-read your entire post with the mindset of a skeptical person who needs to be convinced and analyze it.</p>

<p>The biggest question is why it seems like they exaggerated the number of people who were actually wounded (over 500) and possibly the number of people that were killed. </p>

<p>It&#39;s like we have some kind of a Sandy Hook situation on the ground, with crisis actors taking falls. That doesn&#39;t mean no one was shot/killed, just that it&#39;s really obvious that it wasn&#39;t 500 people, and some of the injuries are obviously fake (rifle wounds to the head that are fixed with 2 days in the hospital).</p>

<p>It seems like were they planning to stage a mass shooting as cover for the hit on the Saudi Prince, with Paddock or someone else as the &quot;lone gunman&quot; Oswald.</p>

<p>OP&#39;s theory makes a whole lot of sense, but now I&#39;m uncertain. It&#39;s difficult to reconcile the presence of crisis actors at the event (anyone remember the &#39;hero&#39; who saved &quot;30 people&quot; after getting shot in the neck?), or at least present shortly after the event to give interviews, with the whole idea that real bullets were fired into the crowd and people were actually getting killed.</p>

<p>The major flaw in this theory is that a number of the people arrested, such as the tech investor Waleed bin Talal or Amr Al-Dabbagh, who&#39;s been working to promote entrepreneurship in the kingdom, are some of the most liberal elites in Saudi Arabia.  Waleed bin Talal is part Armenian and comes from a branch of the royal family once exiled for wanting reforms, ffs.

    <div class="md"><p>“LOL, just no.  Anyone who knows anything about non-traditionals depletion rates understands the limitations of shale. It&#39;s an important but by no means dominant part of the energy equation.”</p>

<p>Bit harsh on the oil component of his theory when all you did was offer up an Art Berman surface level “forecast” on macro production levels. His point that US production has been flat, while importing less, and exporting more actually supports the theory that KSA is in panic mode. Its in their best interest financially the US produces less, imports more, and exports less. They’ve come to stubbornly realize, after flooding the market to unsuccessfully choke out US shale while losing trillions, they’re no longer running things uncontested. Big problem indeed.</p>

<p>The only driver of the energy equation can be summed up in one word - economics - no mention of that in your link you so condescendingly posted as if you were a TA grading a term paper. At the end of the day, Art Berman has a BS in History and a MS in Geology. He can churn out all the papers he wants but the fact is geologists do not calculate reserves and perform economic analyses at E&amp;Ps. Petroleum Engineers do all the heavy lifting which causes many geologist to develop an inferiority complex and over compensate in one way or another but I digress.</p>

<p>Breakeven for the Permian is &lt; $30/bbl while the House of Saud needs around $75/bbl. You can do the math on how much they’ve lost over the last 2.5 years. Like the OP said - big problem. Its fair to assume they are looking to diversify with the US not only far less reliant on foreign oil, but making it uneconomic for much of OPEC to produce, leading these countries to run a massive deficit.  </p>

<p>The OP said KSA was counting on US shale to dry up after 10 years, but it will last 50...while this is hyperbole, he isn’t far off the mark. Wells are forecasted on 40 year decline curves when annual reserve reports are filed with the SEC - including shale. Exxon just spent $6.6B acquiring a highly undeveloped acreage position in the Delaware Basin accounting for billions of barrels of reserves yet to be recovered. They’re one of many operators in one of many US shale basins. It’s entirely realistic between tech advancements, innovation, EOR, and new field discoveries the US will be a disruptive force in the global oil market until renewables completely take over. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a lot of hype talking about $35 shale coming out of wall street and from shills from within the oil industry, but these figures are actually skewed by the drastic reduction in labor inputs as a huge portion of the shale biz got wiped out and put on life support in early 2016.  The breakeven for the Permian is actually closer to 45 dollars, with a range of 30-60 depending on location.  The extraction cost for Saudi oil, however, is less than $9 - the breakeven price is inflated based on the price they need for their government budget, but in terms of cost of production they run circles around us now and forever.  And that&#39;s not even mentioning the fact that their oil comes out of the ground refinery ready whereas our WTI already sells at a steep discount compared to the other major benchmarks (Urals and Brent) due to lack of demand.</p>

<p>Furthermore, you never even addressed the main point, and that is the fact that non-traditionals have a much higher depletion rates, and we&#39;re already seeing evidence of this eating into growth in the Permian.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A new report from Horseman Capital Management Ltd., and cited by Bloomberg, says the decline rates are deeper than usual because drillers are placing too many wells in close proximity to one another. The wells then kill pressure in each other, lowering the amount of oil that can be recovered from them. &quot;New well production is increasingly cannibalizing legacy production,&quot; Russell Clark, investment manager at Horseman Capital Management, wrote in a new report, cited by Bloomberg. &quot;The decline rate looks to be accelerating.&quot;</p>

<p>Shale companies often trumpet their ability to tweak their drilling practices in order to cut costs, boasting about “drilling efficiencies” that have allowed them to lower their breakeven prices over the last three years. But one of those practices is putting so many wells close together, a practice that was thought to squeeze more oil out of the ground at lower cost. However, while the costs might indeed remain low, this new evidence suggests that cramming wells close too close together could be eating into their own potential production levels.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Haha it looks like the name of your game is to pull up imright.com and regurgitate a bunch of points you believe support your position. Theory from the OP just claimed Saudi sees US shale as a threat and I agreed. Thats all.</p>

<p>Nobody is saying the US has more oil reserves than Saudi. I can tell you have zero technical background in the oil and gas business because you used “non-traditional” multiple times to describe whats called an unconventional reservoir (low porosity/low permeability, requires stimulation, higher well density/tighter spacing). Reminds me of the tavern scene of Inglorious Basterds when the Englishman posing as a German gives himself away putting up the wrong three fingers to order drinks. And yeah you’re right when you say there is a difference in decline curves and spacing requirements in conventional vs unconventional reservoirs.</p>

<p>Economics is obviously more granular than the general statement I made as well. Its a function of operator, acreage position, engineering, and geological factors that take years of studying and work experience to comprehend. So don’t talk to me like you understand well spacing, porosity, permeability, viscosity, petrophysics, reservoir heterogeneity, pressure depletion, reservoir management, enhanced oil recovery techniques, stimulation techniques, material balance, etc...because your knowledge appears to be surface level. </p>

<p>The article from oil pro is common sense. Too many straws in the ground will negatively affect reservoir management in a number of ways, and infill drilling can have a unintended impact on the decline curves of parent wells when drainage area is unknown or not considered. There is a lot still being figured out through trial and error in the Permian - including spacing issues which pertain to acceleration vs new capture. There is also different development strategies amongst operators in the Permian. Not everyone is drilling and completing wells at breakneck speed - this impacts those articles you referenced describing aggregate production levels. Its just too complex of an issue to sum up in a few paragraphs. Nonetheless, the point from the OP is still valid in my opinion - KSA has lost market share and they’re concerned about it. Enjoyed your stanley hudson response to my joke. Im done going down this rabbit hole. Last word is all yours.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My two issues with the video are the formation, and the split at the end.</p>

<p>So if you are guarding a target you have one or two covering the back, not some guy occasionally turning around and pointing his gun at him.</p>

<p>The other is at the end the guards seem to continue straight while the last two guys seem to head down a hall to the right.</p>

<p>Them following is odd for sure but the formation and other aspects seem off.</p>

<p>The whowle vegas situation plus what has happened in the past 3 days is definitely weird and possibly connected.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have not seen anything that dates this clip; some say it was filmed at a drill months before. The behavior of the guards is amateur. The formation is not strategic; they are not uniformly garbed; they are loose &amp; juicy and not racked &amp; jacked. Pointing their guns around at people.... meh. The two guys at the end are very casual. Not like lifelong royalty born and bred to rule. They look more to me like a couple of producers riding herd on some of their crisis actors in a drill. Even the public don&#39;t act right at all. Like this is a lark. Not like people in shock or being traumatized. It&#39;s more like some casual off the cuff video of people in between scenes, just walking around getting in positions, and boys will be boys, so yes, playing with their toy guns.</p>

<p>Conclusions:</p>

<p>Must be a Saudi royal family member?</p>

<p>Is it more likely that these are poorly trained LV police being followed by 2 hotel employees?  Or is it more likely that these are personal security escorting a Saudi prince (who apparently doesn&#39;t need the escort that badly because he separates from them at the end of the video)?  If these were private security why wouldn&#39;t they have their VIP surrounded?  Why would he just tag behind them?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Costs have been dramatically reduced with new techniques while output has increased from about 5 percent of the actual oil in the shale to about 17 percent with conservative estimates of an increase to about 25 percent in the near future. So oil produced from fracking has gone up in spite of the glut of world wide oil supplies and lowered profits. Fracking is not stopping but rather increasing. The Saudis are in major trouble. This is why this theory makes so much sense to me even if there are a few gaps in the theory. BTW, I&#39;ve worked in Bakken oil field. It&#39;s a great place to work if you can get on a crew. High pay and great food if you are in the right place. Make sure your contractor has a place for you to stay and pays your room. Otherwise I would skip on it. Even Walmart pays their cashiers about 20 bucks an hour. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>i don&#39;t buy this story.  no insight into casino security, but I would imagine in the event of an active shooter everything at a casino goes into lock down.  EVERYTHING.  that means chips are pushed into a drawer and locked.  that&#39;s it.</p>

<p>this isn&#39;t a 4 drawer community bank.  with 12 feet to the exit.  this is deep inside a casino.</p>

<p>shooting starts, boom.  lockdown.  chips are safe.  vaults are closed.  security starts 911 drills.</p>

<p>all ppl working in casinos in vegas at the time had to take part in some active shooter training.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think a planed attack on a Saudi in the top floors is a good theory however none of these theories explain the pointless mass shooting for me. All it does is attract attention to their position, so rather than just eliminate paddock and stroll out of the hotel room they attract all sorts of law enforcement to their position and have to kill themselves. Doesn&#39;t make sense to me.</p>

<p>One thing however that&#39;s been in the back of my mind is the classic murder cover up technique which involves killing a few other people alongside your actual target to cover up a motive. Was there someone in the crowd who was a target? Maybe those apparent &#39;range finding shots&#39; at the start was actually sniper rounds at this person?</p>

<p>Then there&#39;s the theory of shooters out on the one building near the crowd, and possibly in other locations.  These could be snipers to shoot at the top floor if the prince got cloae enough.  Or they could just be scouts to relay what they see on their end and what is happening at the ground.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Allegedly to distract from a bigger plot to set off a device of some sort is what I&#39;ve heard tossed around. Maybe to let the more important members escape, as the underlings might be kept in the dark on the bigger plan. Shooting at the tanks may have been a warning, and when they murdered Paddock &#39;they&#39; may have realized their original plot was foiled so just started shooting people to make up the difference. Idk, but guess we have to wait til the end of this year just to know Stephen&#39;s motive so gonna be a lot of speculating. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Since you&#39;re having a little trouble, i&#39;ll explain.By the time they had realized the prince wasn&#39;t there, The SWAT had already gathered up most of the assassins. The attention was ALREADY on them. So no, they couldn&#39;t casually walk out, because I bet they weren&#39;t letting anyone out of that hotel.</p>

<p>They would have been stopped, and then the other assassins would have confirmed that they were the last two assassins, then they would all be dead. </p>

<p>SO one pretends to be a crazy lone gunman, while the other &#39;tries&#39; to make a distraction (doesn&#39;t work). This would probably get them a prison sentence if caught, instead of a guaranteed death sentence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the FBI and CIA foiled the assassination plot, but had to cover it up for geopolitical reasons. They went with a mass shooting and made a patsy out of the last loose end they had, Paddock. That makes more sense.</p>

<p>For me, though, this all fell apart when Trump made a deal with Salman to make SA more liberal and stop funding illegal terrorism out of the goodness of his heart. No it looks more like Salman was going to dramatically change SA, to make it more liberal (more in line with what you&#39;d expect from an industrialized nation) in preparation for turning SA one day into a seemingly western nation (with a rigged democracy and everything). These plans probably came as a result of the failed efforts to shut down American fracking in part, sure, but I think it&#39;s more about Salman&#39;s vision for SA. He&#39;d also have to take out his political opponents, because if he plans on liberalizing the country, that means there won&#39;t be enough power left for his colleagues, colleagues that will benefit from continuing the monarchy, as they likely have aspirations of one day taking the monarchy, aspirations that come into conflict with Salman designing a new westernized power structure around his dynasty. The attempted coup was likely a first strike scenario, they knew what was coming. Trying to tie Trump into this as if he&#39;s some kind of saint trying to save all the oppressed people of the extreme muslim world is hilarious to me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, if the plan was to kill Salman and the assassins didn&#39;t know that he wasn&#39;t in the crowd until they were up on the 32nd floor and received the call that he was being escorted out of the Tropicana, it&#39;s somewhat fair to assume that their plan was blown and they panicked and improvised. This could be why there isn&#39;t exactly a <em>good</em> reason for them to open fire on the crowd, but if the FBI/CIA walked into their Patsy, Paddock, dead, with the firearms and assassins missing, then they risk the U.S. intelligence warning Salman of the assassination attempt and leaking their names/the assassin&#39;s employer name to the king - who would then, of course, kill them all in retaliation. Not the best explanation, I know, but either way - it&#39;s looking like the assassins are screwed, so they improvise a not-so-well-thought-out plan and start shooting as a distraction to draw multitudes of police and ambulances and first responders to the streets, giving them more time and hectic-ness (?) to escape with as opposed to simply allowing the FBI/CIA to come after them unobstructed.</p>

<p>Again, this is just me theorizing and trying to contribute to the discussion. Hopefully more leaks and more information is revealed and we can start to make these ties more solidified. Could those range finding shots have been directed at who they <em>thought</em> was Salman, or where he was supposed to be instead of the Tropicana? This explains the reports of shooters and lockdowns at other casinos all around LV. </p>

<p>I think a planed attack on a Saudi in the top floors is a good theory however none of these theories explain the pointless mass shooting for me. All it does is attract attention to their position, so rather than just eliminate paddock and stroll out of the hotel room they attract all sorts of law enforcement to their position and have to kill themselves. Doesn&#39;t make sense to me.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m thinking FBI didn&#39;t know it was an assassination attempt ahead of time and it was just a routine ISIS gun sting. The Four Seasons was the best place for an assassination attempt but assassins couldn&#39;t get guns to the top floor of a Las Vegas casino hotel, but FBI would get guns up there for them in a sting of ISIS members. After Paddock was killed the assassins went to the Prince&#39;s floor and he wasn&#39;t there. FBI was waiting on Paddock&#39;s call to round up the ISIS members but he didn&#39;t call.  Assassins realized it wasn&#39;t a real gun deal but a sting when they found all the empty magazines and that they were fucked, so they allah ackbared the crowd and suicided.  But the FBI got the Prince out.</p>

<p>To hide the signal - inject noise into the system.</p>

<p>I researched the dead bodies a couple of weeks
ago. Many lead back to online identifies which appear fake. That is - no pictures older than 2012, no friends in common with me. No family members posting on the deceased walls. No ability to find funeral plans. When memorials are held, few people show up.</p>

<p>What&#39;s the possibility that a some hacker out they had a bunch of shill accounts?</p>

<p>What&#39;s the possibility that these shill accounts are purchased as &quot;proof&quot; that someone died.</p>

<p>Who died?
Where are their funerals?
Who are there family members?
What&#39;s the relationship of the Gofund me accounts?
Friends? Family?
What are the posts like on these funding sites?
Close friends family members? Or people writing &quot;i don&#39;t know you but...&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You filled just about every hole in the entire Vegas shooting narrative. Thing is, your theory doesn&#39;t have any hole at all. This explains so much. The Trump visit, the roundup of Saudi Royalty. The numerous shooting reports. The police radio chatter. That one guy who with his girlfriend met a middle eastern guy with a suspicious suitcase who threatened them and then ran. I kept thinking, the numerous shootings were distractions. But I also thought the MB shooting seemed a distraction. But, I do suspect one thing missing. Jesus Campos was lying. He wasn&#39;t shot or even injured at all. The building engineer was repeating a narrative even he didn&#39;t believe. They are plants designed to cover the truth. They are either plants by our guys or by the assassins and are being used to plant a false narrative to distract from the reality and reinforce the lone gunman narrative. You don&#39;t address the problem with the car that had tannite explosives in it. I have no idea why that was there. A distraction to aid a retreat? Something obviously went wrong with the attempt. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ohhh. Now I see why the FBI went so hard core to cover this shit up. Duh!!!. They had to keep a lid on this because they were cooperating with the Saudi King  so they had to pretend they had no idea what was going on. Keep the false narrative going to give him time to get his ducks in a row and make his arrests and purge. Otherwise, there would be another assassination attempt and the second time it might succeed. Oh, hell. I get it now. Makes perfect sense suddenly. That&#39;s why they help protect and control the fake hotel engineer and Campos. Poor Laura Loomer was chasing her tail trying to interview Campos. I did give her a good lead on the truth about multiple shooters but she went back too late to get the evidence other than one random bullet impact she managed to find. All the others were scrubbed by FBI. Gosh. the FBI worked their asses off to hide those impacts. They couldn&#39;t let the truth get out. Damn. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I love the research but my main issues are as follows:
- Donald Trump isn&#39;t some stalwart for women&#39;s rights and liberalism. If he was trying to get something out of the Saudi&#39;s I think the IPO is closer to the mark. The women&#39;s right&#39;s might be to ingratiate America to their cause but it&#39;s not cause Trump is demanding it. 
-What about the meeting with Kushner and the Saudis. Are we okay with non-documented coups being coordinate in secret by brother-in laws? If so, whatever, it&#39;s already happening, I&#39;m just trying to be consistent.
- What about Iran? We&#39;re hearing the drumbeats of war with Iran after the missiles into Saudi Arabia. Who&#39;s to say that the deal with Trump isn&#39;t for letting women drive but it&#39;s for bringing vast sums of money to the US (IPO) for him and his buddies to invest him while stoking war with Iran which would also increase the price of oil.</p>

<p>in general, I&#39;m more anti-Trump / anti-I&#39;m not sure if he knows what he&#39;s doing rather than thinking it&#39;s all planned out. Either way, interesting. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;ve spun a yarn, but in my opinion you&#39;ve missed the big picture. Trump was there opening a new place called Center For Combatting Extremism (or something to that effect). It made a worldwide statement, that all countries would begin to turn against those citizens within them, that had become &quot;extreme&quot;. It&#39;s got to do with economics sure. It&#39;s got to do with diversifying a portfolio, sure, but moves are made when convenient, but there has also been a push for many years, by progressive socialism and globalism, to work between the seams to gain the upper hand. One of the ways they do this is by changing warfare itself, and there was a man at Westpoint who wrote about the next generation of war being both cyber and physical.
To skip to my point, I have this vast theory in my pocket that I&#39;ve been developing for say 28 years, and I feel much of it is relevant. </p>

<p>Warfare is changing, and the next generation will be based heavily on COIN (CointerInsurgency) as a strategy. There are a lot of moving peices in my theory, but what it comes down to is that there will either be a new nuclear deal, or there will be a new nuclear arms/defence race, or there will be a new war. It will come down to whichever is more profitable, and that must take into consideration the inevitability of a thinning of the herd (one way or the other).</p>

<p>There are &quot;re-education camps&quot; in the UK now. Their first year saw 1500 people put in these regular looking government buildings. How long before guantanamo closes and reopens down the road? Just a matter of time.</p>

<p>To reiterate- this war on terror will eventually be a war against you and me. Society is closing. Information is a game and the peices always seem to fit, but how certain are you?</p>

<p>Ho confident are you, that your theory is the whole truth and that there isnt much more?</p>

<p>Whats happening in Lebanon now, is a huge setup. We need to talk more about war and yes economics, but more about war. I happen to know a thing or two about, that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Read the first half. Don&#39;t agree.</p>

<p>KSA upped production so prices would drop, at the behest of the US, to target the economies of Russia, Iran and Venezuela, all heavily reliant on oil/gas. That was around the same time those countries were being squeezed by America. It has diddly squat to do with fracking.</p>

<p>Shillary Clinton was one of the biggest promoters of fracking around the world, check the email leaks. Even Sanders pointed this out in the primaries. I don&#39;t know what&#39;s the deal with fracking, but it had absolutely nothing to do with the drop in the oil price. The idea that the Democrats under Hillary would have enforced enviromental regulations is delusional beyond belief. Didn&#39;t read beyond this nonsense.</p>

OPEC has had a monopoly on not only oil, but the petro-dollar, ever since Nixon sold us up the river to the Saudis.  YES, OPEC waged war on prices to kill the shale boom, and although not ALL &#39;new&#39; shale/fracking businesses went under, plenty did b/c of OPEC&#39;s price drop.  This was all over the news, both US and internationally, at the time.

<p>I&#39;d like to add a thought that occurred to me reading your theory. Could it be possible that the deal was all set up by the FBI, Paddock (the asset) as the &#39;independent arms dealer&#39;, the FBI have the whole place bugged with cameras, wires etc so they can catch what they think are isis terrorists as soon as they do the deal, the assassins check in obviously under extreme surveillance and this is when the FBI find out they aren&#39;t isis terrorists like they thought but KSA assassins plotting to kill the prince. The whole plan goes tits up and they have to cancel, assassins realize they&#39;ve been conned and go on the rampage as you said. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, as interesting as this is it comes across a little too much like blind praise for Trump. Am I supposed to believe he&#39;s really the good guy in all of this? Or that there even is a good guy? I don&#39;t know, it just seems too neat and convenient. And while I admit I don&#39;t like Trump and that may be making me biased here, we should probably also acknowledge that OP is a T_D poster with plenty of biases of his own. That may be skewing the interpretation of these events quite a lot, especially considering that they key points of this post are based purely on assumptions. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hold on bro.  The only part Trump really plays in this entire story is to tell the Saudis to behave.  That&#39;s it.  I do link the Saudis to the DNC quite a bit, but that connection is not a secret.   99% of the post is about the internal turmoil in KSA because of fracking and the events on the night of Oct. 1. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wasn&#39;t presenting it as a counter-argument or trying to say that OP&#39;s theory doesn&#39;t count. If I was trying to do that I would point out that most of his key theories revolve around nothing more than assumptions that have no supporting facts. Let&#39;s go through some examples:  </p>

<p>1) <em>Leftists are pro environment so must be anti-fracking, and therefore that is why Saudi Arabia supported Hillary and payed leftists to convince the world fracking is bad</em>. Not only is this ignoring the fact that fracking may in fact have some environmental risks and people might be concerned about this without being paid, it also completely ignores the fact that Hillary has always been fairly pro-fracking. And even if that weren&#39;t the case, it is still a complete reach to say that the one reason Saudi Arabia supported Hillary is because she would help them shut down fracking. This also ignores the fact that both Republicans and Democrats have been best buddies with Saudi Arabia for years. This isn&#39;t just a &quot;leftist&quot; or DNC thing, it&#39;s every major American politician.</p>

<p>2) <em>Saudi Arabia is moving away from an oil based economy and wants Donald Trump to help them industrialize</em>. Is any of this even true? I&#39;m not super up to date on Saudi Arabian current events, but what evidence do we have that they are trying to diversify away from oil, that they asked the US to help, or that we are helping?</p>

<p>3) <em>&quot;The May 2017 meeting between Trump and King Salman (and his son Mohammad), was not just another meeting. It was a business meeting. King Salman asked Trump for help. Trump was more than willing to give it (like listing the oil companies on the NYSE) but his help would come with a price. Liberalization and the stop of illegal funding.&quot;</em> What is this based on? This isn&#39;t even a theory so much as a story of how great of a businessman Trump is. OP speaks like this is all fact but what evidence is there that Saudi Arabia needs Trumps business advice? Are they trying to open a fraudulent school or something? Saudi Arabia is toning down their human rights violations slightly and this is because Trump forced them to in exchange for his amazing business advice? This sounds like a T_D circlejerk more than anything based in reality.</p>

<p>4) <em>The assumption that all of the princes, businessmen, etc that were arrested or killed were the badguys.</em> This has been posted around this subreddit a lot recently as if it were fact, but everything I have read elsewhere makes it seem like no one really knows who is good and who is bad here or why any of this is happening. OP paints a wonderful picture of the benevolent leader fighting off a coup attempt from the evil princes, but this could just as easily be a power-hungry prince eliminating all of his competition with support from the US in exchange for guaranteed arms sales in the future. Lets not forget that the prince who is taking power is also the one responsible for the war in Yemen. Seems like the perfect ruler for the American war machine to support.</p>

<p>5) <em>Pretty much everything about the Las Vegas shooting.</em> I&#39;ve read a lot of the different theories about the massacre, and this is certainly one of them. I see several major issues with it though. First of all, those videos do not show what OP claims they show. The SWAT guys walking through the Tropicana appear to be escorting a medic and two other civilians, possibly casino staff. If they are protecting a VIP, they are doing an awful job of it. They don&#39;t even have him surrounded! And the supposed prince only bares a slight resemblance to the actual guy. The second video is even worse. It&#39;s literally a cellphone video of a grainy youtube video. Maybe it shows a dead body, but it&#39;s impossible for me to tell. You would think a shootout with trained assassins in a crowded casino would have more evidence that a deliberately difficult to see video. Also there&#39;s the fact that the shooting has a lot of signs that it was pre-planned and not just a spur of the moment decision by some assassins whose plan backfired. I absolutely believe there is more to this story than the FBI are telling us, but I&#39;m not convinced that this is what happened. Certainly not with only this little evidence anyway.  </p>

<p>And as for my bias, at least I was upfront about it. I don&#39;t like Trump, I think he&#39;s a corrupt businessman and he isn&#39;t concerned about helping anyone but himself. That alone isn&#39;t the reason I doubt this theory though. I doubt it because as far as I can tell, it is just a story that OP made up that sounds really cool. And it really does sound cool, it&#39;s some excellent writing and would probably make a good Hollywood movie. It&#39;s just awful convenient how it happens to make Trump, Kushner, and the current Saudi rulers look like the good guys while making the DNC, the FBI, and the ousted Saudis look like the bad guys. Things are rarely that black and white in real life.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll tell you, becoz the &#39;official narrative&#39;, which was a lie, couldn&#39;t hold up and rather than dig themselves deeper into a hole, they got everyone to shut up. And thanks to the likes of Rupert Murdoch, who owns 80% of <em>the worlds</em> MSM, this is easily done</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nice fan fiction mongoliod
So many problems with this babbling incoherence. 
Well, I think the general idea and theory is solid but including the tropicana stuff and some of the other things is too far into the realm of speculation. 
Up until that point you could follow the facts. But for fucks sake the tropicana video is obviously a whoever was on duty, thrown together, all hands on deck, LEO team clearing the casino floor of potential threats. Maybe there were other shooters maybe not, but understandably they had to do due diligence. 
The guy in suit behind the officers was most likely the on shift head of casino security and the guy in street clothes was probably off duty head of security or high ranking security officer who came in for the emergency. He even appears to be carrying a hand gun case.
They would of been leading the LEOs through the building seeing as they know the layout.</p>

<p>At the end of that video you can hear them saying to the officers &quot;we&#39;re breaking off&quot;, and then walk a different direction while the officers say something to the effect of &quot;let&#39;s do this&quot;. I&#39;m speculating but I would guess the tropicana was cleared, and the security guys were going to the office to see the cameras or to attend to whatever other responsibility they would have in that situation whilst the LEOs were heading back towards the street to clear the next hotel.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dQ17_LWFZs">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dQ17_LWFZs</a> - This one&#39;s recently been censored from <em>Youtube</em>, but it was titled: <em>Las Vegas Shooting Hoax EXPOSED | Compilation of Clips is 100% PROOF!</em>, had a few thousand views and a lot of likes iirc.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not 100% sure how this fits into your hypothesis. I don&#39;t think it outright refutes it, but I do think it ought to be tweaked some to account for this. Thanks for the insightful perspective though, and keep up the good work!</p>

Also, another witness describes in detail seeing a body in Tropicana. Both he and his girlfriend met a Middle eastern guy with a suitcase who claimed there was nothing in the suitcase but then laid it on the floor and asked them with a grin if they wanted to see what was in it. Then gunfire erupted in the direction this guy had been directing people. The man then ran toward the gunfire. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure.  The death squads would mostly like be Saudi nationals here on tourist visas.  They would be going through customs, just like you and I would when going to a foreign country or returning to the US.  No way you&#39;re sneaking in guns.  And if you bring it here legally, you leave a paper trace which can be traced back to you and your employer, so that&#39;s not an option.  The only thing they can do is purchase the guns here in the US.</p>

<p>Now, contrary to what the left will tell you, you can&#39;t just walk into a store and just buy a gun.  There are background checks, ID checks and so on.    If you don&#39;t have a valid US ID, you can&#39;t buy a gun, especially multiple guns.  So a deal for a mass purchase has to be made.</p>

<p>But that&#39;s only half the problem.  How are a dozen Arab guys gonna bring 28 guns into a heavily monitored casino hotel and not get detected?  Impossible.  So Paddock solves both problems for them.   One, he can supply the guns.  And two, he&#39;s a regular at the hotel, a big spender.  So when he&#39;s bringing up huge amounts of luggage, no one looks twice.  </p>

Everything else makes sense, but this part -- I just don&#39;t think that&#39;s a rational reaction to what happened, and these guys were obviously super smart. Seems to me they&#39;d take some guns, take the elevator down to the first floor, and book it. There will be some cops, but not enough to stop them with their larger weapons.</p>

<p>Could it be that some stayed behind while others got away? That the shooting was literally a real-time distraction? One guy stayed behind -- thus why the shooting was only ever from one gun. One stayed behind while two or three others got away.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very interesting theory...  </p>

<p>I would add two seemingly unrelated items that fit nicely within the overarching agenda of the Sunni Muslim agenda.  The goal of Islam is world domination, not just regional influence or financial strength.  </p>

<p>Test how the events described above fit with the recent release of <a href="https://onegram.org/">OneGram</a>, a gold-backed, Sharia-compliant cryptocurrency, along with the announcement of <a href="http://discoverneom.com/">Neom</a>, an all-inclusive 26,500 square kilometer multi-national, multi-cultural super community stretching across northern Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Jordan.  </p>

<p>Iran threatens their ability to accomplish their <a href="http://discoverneom.com/">Neom</a> goals, as does Hezbollah (in Lebanon) and the entire Shia Crescent (including recent alliances made between Iran, Turkey and Russia) if they are not dealt with before they establish themselves as the regional power.  </p>

<p>In the end, the United States also stands in the way of Islam&#39;s world-dominating agenda.  </p>

<p>If every Muslim nation (and Muslim individual) adopted OneGram as the only means of currency in commerce, the US Dollar and all other world currencies (including the IMF&#39;s SDR) would quickly become obsolete, especially if the UN is behind Neom.  </p>

<p>If the US Dollar stops being the world reserve currency, our world power status quickly dissolves because we will no longer be able to finance our existence through fiat monetary policies.</p>

<p>I find it awfully coincidental that the Saudis and UN both target 2030 for their respective agendas.  Then again, this is just a theory...</p>

<p>Some detail here. Not only did fracking continue, the pressure on fracking coming from lowered crude prices caused the industry to work harder and develop better and cheaper methods to extract the oil from shale. The wells also went from recovering about 5% to recovering around 17% and with the new technology in the works to improve those recovery rates to around 25% in the near future as well as expand the length of time a well will be useful. So, production INCREASED from the fracking wells and is expected to continue to rise for the next 50 years. Also, those states where fracking is illegal, some of them may give a green light on Fracking as their economy worsens due to liberal policies and they look for more tax revenue. </p>

<strong>Still not satisfied on the shooting of the crowd though.</strong>  I think the crowd shooting has more to it.  Why why why shoot up a crowd for 40 min?  It would also be nice to know how many of the AR’s had bump-stocks.  Also nice to know why the hammer was in the room (could it be planted?)  Also why all the video monitoring?  I know it’s very hard to address these questions because we’re not privy to the evidence.  Maybe someday an anon will deliver more goods.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good questions~!  I&#39;ll try to answer best I can.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>They don&#39;t know others are captured.  They only know that the prince isn&#39;t in the rooms above and that they have to hide that an assassination attempt was planned.</p></li>
<li><p>Lol.  I didn&#39;t know there was a hammer.  I just took a re-look at the room picture and you are right.  But the hammer could have been used to secure the floor.  Remember the doors were jammed.  Maybe they brought it to put nails in the doors.</p></li>
<li><p>Some guys are saying that it&#39;s impossible to reload 100 round mags in avg of 40 sec.  You&#39;re saying it&#39;s too long of a time?</p></li>
<li><p>Saudi&#39;s aren&#39;t that dark.  And Saudi&#39;s are known to shave.  But as I said in the post, we don&#39;t know exactly who they were after.  It could be the crown prince or it could be someone else close to the throne.  OR, I could have the whole story backward and the assassination attempt was made on this guy <a href="http://middleeastpress.com/english/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/04/prince-muqrin-bin-abdul-aziz-saudi.jpg">http://middleeastpress.com/english/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/04/prince-muqrin-bin-abdul-aziz-saudi.jpg</a>   Muqrin, the former deputy crown prince.  In that theory, King Salman is trying to wipe out the opposition.  But that requires a whole new line of reasoning from the start.  Maybe I&#39;ll do that version some day.</p></li>
<li><p>I was thinking about that.  How do we know how many volleys were actually fired out the window vs how many where fired in to the hallway to defend themselves?  Maybe a firefight with the swat team occurred that we don&#39;t know about.  You know how the people in the crowd are not dying as often as you&#39;d think?  Maybe the latter barrages were a firefight with the swat team who arrived a lot quicker than they anticipated.</p></li>
<li><p>Nono. The LVMPD definitely entered first.  And they saw the extra bodies.  And they were coerced to lie about it.  Notice how shaky the Sheriff is in his press conferences?</p></li>
<li><p>Because the assassins were hired by Saudi royals who killed 59 people and injured nearly 500, all for their internal politics.</p></li>
<li><p>Plant.</p></li>
<li><p>Maybe they shot the tanks first to try to get it to blow to distract the police.  When that failed, they started attacking the crowd.  Either way, their objective is to disguise the assassination by making it look like a terror attack.  Blowing things up, shooting in to a crowd, pretty much accomplishes the same objectives I think.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Sorry the answers aren&#39;t too convincing but that&#39;s all I got :)  Enjoy~</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t shoot, but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XIyAQjVPPE">I Google</a>. Sure seems easy to remove a magazine and load in a new one in a few seconds, especially if I&#39;ve trained my muscle memory to do this in high stress environments, with my eyes closed. When you say &quot;reload&quot; do you mean take an empty mag and place 100 bullets in it? I&#39;ve assume each mag was already loaded with bullets.</p>

<p>Re: #9, if they wanted a distraction, why not blow the vehicle full of explosives? Even still, why would professional soldiers not have an exfil plan in place that didn&#39;t require an escalated event with hundreds of victims? I always assumed low key was the way of assassins.</p>

<p>Not at all. Unlike v/truthzealot I do shoot, a lot and I&#39;m a &#39;Nam vet. No one that I have ever seen can load a hundred round mag in 40 seconds. Loading a mag into the gun can be done in less than 40 even by a neophyte. Loading the rounds into the mag (they don&#39;t come pre-loaded) is much more time consuming. It&#39;s also harder than most people realize if they have never done it. Your thumb gets sore really fast and if you keep going you&#39;ll wear the skin off.  </p>

<p>One more point I&#39;d like to make, what I heard in all the videos was not a bump stock firing, it was full auto and one of the guns was a belt fed. I could distinguish two calibers, a 5.56 x 45mm and a 7.62 x 51mm. The 7.62 sounded similar to the M60&#39;s we used in &#39;Nam, yet different. It was very familiar, I had a hard time placing it. Finally it dawned on me, it was a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FN_Herstal">Fabrique Nationale</a>. To be exact it was an <a href="https://fnamerica.com/products/machine-guns/fn-m240b/">M240B</a> belt fed. Yet a belt fed was never mentioned in the &quot;official story.&quot; Most people might buy that lie, but I know better. Also the room Paddock was in should have been littered with spent brass. That stuff adds up fast when shooting full auto. I saw 100 rd 5.56 mags in the room but no spent brass. It should have been wall to wall on the floor.</p>

<p>Now, the belt fed guns are only legal to own by a select few citizens. Any full auto made after 1986 (law) can only be possessed by certain citizens. </p>

<p>If you would like to hear one and see one being shot. Here&#39;s a video of my 11 year old grandson shooting one. He&#39;s very safe and loves guns so I decided it was time to introduce him to full auto: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrC9q0oM0N8">Video</a> </p>

<p>That&#39;s the sound I heard in the videos. All guns and calibers have a slightly different sound. I&#39;ve been around them enough to be able to distinguish a lot of them just by their sound. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So we&#39;re saying the same thing, right? Reloading a mag is very fast, but loading rounds into a mag is not.</p>

<p>If it was belt fed, does that imply such a weapon was hidden in a cover up?</p>

<p>Also, how many rounds are in a single belt?</p>

<p>If it was belt fed, it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vClOquwimP4">appears to be even easier to reload than a magazine</a>. So we&#39;re back to the drawing board on why the reload interval was so long (especially if we assume these were trained gunmen).</p>

<p>Gonna stop you right there.  While true that fracking fluid is mostly water and sand, they also use chemical agents that remain underground to hold the fissures open.  Those chemical agents can be a number of different things, they&#39;re real vague about what they are actually and so I have to assume that what they are pumping down there is actually bad for the environment.  You would have to be supremely naive to believe an energy company, who had the potential to make billions of dollars doing this, wouldn&#39;t use dangerous chemicals in their process if it meant extracting the oil/gas more efficiently.  </p>

He then did not check into any ER or clinic for another eleven days, and managed to drive to Mexico, with a leg wound. By the way, almost all leg wounds are fatal. He would have to be extremely lucky for the bullet to not tear through his major artery, muscles, and not crush his bone. Also, he is not even registered to be a security guard in Nevada. So I get the feeling that he works into this story in an entirely different capacity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I read one of your earlier posts about Vegas, and I thought it seemed pretty believable, but this takes it to an entirely different level. Great job. I do have a few things that I am trying to make sense of.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>If the FBI/CIA thought they were going to be selling guns to terrorists why would they pick a room overlooking a music festival with 25,000 civilians? I know the idea of being hidden in plain sight, but there must have been other rooms that could have been used.</p></li>
<li><p>Is it possible that Campos was also FBI? I suspect if the FBI had a major gun deal going down, they would want agents in surrounding rooms or the hallway incase something goes wrong. I think Campos and the other maintenance worker who came forward may have been FBI agents posing as hotel security and maintenance workers. Doesn’t really change your theory since he could have still gotten shot when trying to move in.</p></li>
<li><p>Why wasn’t the man being escorted protected from his rear? All of the people doing the escorting are in front of him leaving his backside completely vulnerable</p></li>
<li><p>The thing I am having the hardest time understanding is the financial ties. There were MGM stock sell-offs beginning in early September including huge put options by George Soros. In addition to that, stocks related to gun manufacturers began to climb around the same time. Based on this information as well as my first point (which I don’t think is just a coincidence), I think the plan all along involved shooting into the crowd at least some number of rounds. Whether that was to create a diversion away from the real assassination attempt or not is difficult to understand. I want to believe that firing on the crows was just a spur of the moment decision like you seem to imply, but based on the financials I don’t think that is the case. Do you have a possible explanation for the events if this part of the attack was premeditated? Were FBI agents going to take out the shooters in the middle of the attack to be heroes?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Thanks again for a great theory.</p>

<pre><code>Prince Salam came up with Vision 2030. Theoretically, it was shift away from oil; selling off part of Aramco; and an attempt to bring in new industries.
Yet Vision 2030 cannot possibly work when the majority of productive jobs in Saudi Arabia are held by expats. Bringing in new jobs raises the question of where are the new (skilled) workers to come from.

The assassination attempt allows King Salman to clean house and drain the royal swamp of any Sunni Waheeb heirs who don&#39;t agree this is what they have to do. The country has to become more liberal in order to bring in workers in order to build a $500 billion city in 8 years.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Remember that people critisized Trump for saying that it was a MIRACLE? Well going on this theory it seems like this situation could have been waaaaay worse had they pulled of a murderous coup right in a US hotel. Not minimizing the deaths that happened by any means but had this situation gone down this way wow it would have been a NIGHTMARE!!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Costs have been dramatically reduced with new techniques while output has increased from about 5 percent of the actual oil in the shale to about 17 percent with conservative estimates of an increase to about 25 percent in the near future. So oil produced from fracking has gone up in spite of the glut of world wide oil supplies and lowered profits. Fracking is not stopping but rather increasing. The Saudis are in major trouble. This is why this theory makes so much sense to me even if there are a few gaps in the theory. BTW, I&#39;ve worked in Bakken oil field. It&#39;s a great place to work if you can get on a crew. High pay and great food if you are in the right place. Make sure your contractor has a place for you to stay and pays your room. Otherwise I would skip on it. Even Walmart pays their cashiers about 20 bucks an hour. </p>

<p>Sure she could have used that as leverage, as in to say she told them she would change her position on the matter if they were to come to an agreement (considering everybody had expected her to be the next POTUS.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, as interesting as this is it comes across a little too much like blind praise for Trump. Am I supposed to believe he&#39;s really the good guy in all of this? Or that there even is a good guy? I don&#39;t know, it just seems too neat and convenient. And while I admit I don&#39;t like Trump and that may be making me biased here, we should probably also acknowledge that OP is a T_D poster with plenty of biases of his own. That may be skewing the interpretation of these events quite a lot, especially considering that they key points of this post are based purely on assumptions. </p>
