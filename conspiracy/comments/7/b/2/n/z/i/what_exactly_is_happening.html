Anyhow, with everything happening all at once, I see comments saying “it’s happening” or “shit is getting real” and I’m pretty lost as to what everyone’s meaning of this is. In other words, what will the end result, in you mind, be from all that has gone on since Vegas to the Paradise Papers. Thanks, and keep questioning the narrative! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Question - have you been noticing anything out of the ordinary around you recently? At the risk of sounding a bit out there I have this theory that certain people are sensitive to the &#39;program&#39; if you will. I&#39;ve been noticing little sort of &#39;mistakes&#39;. Like a song will be on a personal playlist that I didn&#39;t add. Or a message will appear on my phone but the phone didn&#39;t format it properly and then it&#39;s gone. Increase in deja vu. I had a bizzarre symbolic dream about the end of thw world where the White House had spires like the kremlin and was painted red. It felt like the ultimate symbol of greed and corruption. I feel like we might he coming to the end of the world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The CIA is a subversive group. One of many government agencies that make up the deepstate. The deep state contains people that are on government payroll but often you and I could never prove that they are.. Contractors working civilian jobs but receiving government paychecks.
Since 9/11, nearly every single terror attack committed in America (and most in Europe) have actually been hoaxes perpetrated by the powers that be. For example, the Boston bombing brothers were CIA assets working back and forth between America and Chechnya. The CIA uses any means necessary to enact regime change in whichever country they choose, including the staging of hoax terror attacks. The CIA knew exactly where the brother were during the entire Boston bombing play. That didn&#39;t stop them from entering peoples houses, forcing the owners out with their hands on their heads while the swat teams (((searched))) for the brothers. The brothers are both alive and in Chechnya.
It&#39;s important to note that these events are very very real acts of terrorism. These events are special made to terrorize. When people are terrified they are easier to control. They will be more willing to gobble up any comfortable narrative reported to them.
Since 9/11 the Zionist/Freemason/corporatist have lied about Muslim terrorism to terrorize us into paying for wars in the Middle East. The list of these hoax attacks is so long I will not share the entire list as it would turn many people away before they even researched one. It&#39;s common to hear, &quot;that&#39;s why I can&#39;t believe conspiracy theorists. They can&#39;t ALL be fake!&quot;
I am here to tell you that yes, they can all be fake. People do not go on random killing sprees of strangers for no reason. Autistic kids to not kill random classrooms full of kids. Millionaires do not randomly kill county music fans, Muslims do not blow themselves up for Isis. The demand for terrorists was much greater than the supply, so the CIA and legally protected media stepped in..
Hoaxes = sandy hook, Boston bombing, pulse night club, Charlottesville, Barcelona, NYC etc</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think we are at the liminal point of what is commonly being termed “epistemological collapse” following what has evidently been the “in-house”-apologetic philosophical position (which may be termed Wittgensteinian anti-realist) undergirding not only neoliberal capitalist elite strategizing but the latter’s convinced ‘public’ ethics as well in lieu and in the hopes of the eventual arrival of a “technological singularity” that would finally give autonomous ubiquitous (empirical) reality to what have increasingly, nay inexorably, become ever more desperately anti-realist sophistries precariously balanced on all but the slipperiest slivers of capitalist philosophical idealism.</p>

<p>These veritable surrealities have been in increasing use in the West since at least the Vietnam War to defend the now massively, nay monstrously, democratically-corrosive core of an imperial system, whose very economic dimensions are ipso facto incompatible with all but the most abstracted and impotent forms of participatory national democracy. The Pentagon system necessitates by its very unprecedented and unparalleled economic existence (which may be termed ‘vortiginous’ for truth) a constant epistemological unreality to disguise and camouflage an essentially anti-democratic, i.e. imperial, ontology (a reality that through itself engenders an infinitely expansive and aggressive telos that is simultaneously its own circular entrapment). It such innately anti-democratic ontological exigencies that therefore of necessity incessantly generate all manner of irrealities, all the way from the knowingly cynical and immensely costly, predatory, and sanguinary confusion between geographically limited Soviet threat and universal and rational anti-colonial national liberation movements down to the originally picayune and distractive absurdities of sexually subjective parsings, which nevertheless have the potential to become the linguistic germs from which will flower new epistemological, indeed cognitive, structures (anthropological directives) through which the universal reconfiguration of entire civilizations may proceed apace.</p>

<p>When has there ever been an empire that did not float upon a sea of lies, the Soviet empire eventually sunk under the combined lies of self and foe, will the American empire be sunk by its own, or will the truth of the lies in convergence online with the lies of the truth be its ultimate undoing, as it was for the Clinton campaign?</p>
