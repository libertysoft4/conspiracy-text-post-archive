    <div class="md"><p>There are plenty of benefits for the FBI... they get to do their job for realsies and actually make arrests on cases they worked hard developing.

<p>Did you really just call him &quot;the Mueller&quot;? I think Trump fired Comey for the same reason Comey sidestepped Lynch... lack of public trust. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cause HRC would wanna blanket protect political allies and donors... Trump&#39;s lack of allegiance to party give the FBI open season on corruption. </p>

<p>Contrary to popular belief the FBI is mostly made up of some of the best investigators and cops in the country and do the job not for the money or the fame or power, but because they wanna do what is right for their country and protect the innocent... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean, I admire your thinking acrobatics but this just sounds sooooo far fetched to me. Over complicated. There is a much less complicated theory here: no deal with FBI, deal with Russia, comey getting fired for not cooperating with Trump, new head investigator the Mueller doing his job, Russia doing everything it can to mislead from the truth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A lot of far fetched shit happens in the real world... this all just some head-cannon I have cooked up... but there aren&#39;t really too many holes to be poked into the theory. Trump has connections to the FBI going way back... that is the simple explanation for his &quot;4D chess&quot;... he&#39;s had someone leaking him info from inside an intelligence agency... </p>

<p>I mean the real answer is probably super boring... the dems ran a super shitty candidate that a lot of people didn&#39;t want so they didn&#39;t vote for her so the other guy won... but this ain&#39;t the board for that kinda rational thought. </p>

I think both of us are right to a certain degree... but my theory is a whole hell of a lot more original and impactful... it give us hope for a beautiful future... whereas yours is just plain old boring and depressing. No one can prove a negative... but I bet we are right... the Russians and other nations worked to cause unrest during the elections... and the FBI is gonna take down a whole slew of corrupt politicians and lobbyists. Mine certainly has the most upsides if it is true... best case scenario with yours is that we get 3 years of President Pence. Yawn. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well the real situation is kinda boring... they are like 3 no name lobbyists that are only getting the spotlight cause they have some sort of connection to Trump. It wouldn&#39;t be news at all aside from people are hoping this gets them a little closer to Trump... when really they should realize that these guys are prolly the concession prize. But I&#39;m glad these dudes are arrested... I hope there are 100s more from both sides of the aisle that go down hard. </p>

<p>My speculation of this comes because of this picture at the Bohemian Grove, taken in 1967 </p>

<p>So yeah, 2 presidents chilling with the guy who helped build the nuke and an oil magnate/politician/CIA spook. Seems like these guys were chosen in advance. Unless thats just coincidence. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>He was elevated by the Clinton/globalist camp for a pied piper victory. They thought he would fail horrendously in the general. Another theory is he was chosen by Marine and military elites in order to save the republic. Notice how he surrounds himself with tons of 4 star marine generals? Did you know
Marines have a special allegiance to the president specifically? Interestingly enough mueller has a marine background as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You assume it all was a plan, but was it? Why was every celebrity and politician trying to denounce trump? Why did kasich and Cruz team up and tell voters in specific states to vote a certain way to ensure trump wasn&#39;t nominated? Why was trump the 1st topic at the bilderburg meeting? Why did 200 billionaires and elites meet off the coast of Africa to discuss how to put an end to Trump? Do you really think Trump was (their) desire? Do you think it&#39;s good for the elite to have a president that called Obama the founder of ISIS, global warming a hoax, vaccine skeptic, and touted by Alex Jones? You think it&#39;s all decided well it seems that &quot;decision&quot; was that it was Hillary&#39;s &quot;turn&quot; given she conceded to Obama in 08 after thinking she had it in the bag then too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Continuing my analogy with the WWE, you see story lines where a heel, like Vince McMahon, gets away with being terrible and everyone hates him.  Meanwhile, WWE ratings skyrocket...  Yes, all those things you mention make sense to me as part of the plan.  Also, I&#39;m not convinced the actual elections matter at all; i.e. outcome pre-planned regardless of how people vote.  There&#39;s enough confusion in the American voting system to control the outcome with just a few control points.</p>

This was part of, not the deciding factor, in how Trump became president.

<p>Now, more known members of the Christian Mafia are in positions of power in all three branches of government than ever before.  They are not the only group in charge of things, but definitely a major player on the world stage.  </p>

<p>Many people supported Bernie but as far back as the primaries we knew Bernie was getting hosed. At the democratic convention everyone was pissed HRC got the nomination. Everyone knew she stole it. Half the DNC walked out and they paid people to come in and fill up the seats.</p>

<p>HRC&#39;s &quot;rallies&quot; were pathetically small and we saw evidence that the crowds were being edited in digitally (cut paste in photos, cell phones being held up in videos that didnt have the same content on the screens, etc)</p>

<p>When it came down to it, more people in more counties voted Trump, which tipped the scale for the Electoral College and he was elected.</p>

<p>The democrats then spent the next year throwing a fit and trying to make us all believe the Russians had staged a coup. And now the real criminals are being routed and are about to get rounded up like the dogs they are.</p>
