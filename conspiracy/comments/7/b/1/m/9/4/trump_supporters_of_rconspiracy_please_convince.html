<p>no, it&#39;s pretending to be friends, while taking much larger moves to cripple behind the scenes.</p>

<p>no, that&#39;s assange trying to stay alive.</p>

<p>right well...</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>CLINTONS</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>the clintons hate obama  (hhaaaaate)</li>
<li>hillary <a href="http://forward.com/opinion/national/324013/how-i-would-rebuild-ties-to-israel-and-benjamin-neta/">sucks netanyahu&#39;s dick for breakfast</a></li>
<li>totally in bed with the pedo-compromised hollywood elite</li>
<li>totally pedo compromised herself</li>
<li>accepts bucketloads of money from the pedo-comrpomised saudis</li>
<li>accepts bucketloads of money from the zio-fascist bankers</li>
<li>hillary compromised obama in so many ways... especially via the blackberrys (ref: <a href="http://georgewebb.transcriber.wiki/search.results?x=blackberries">george webb</a>)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>OBAMAS</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>michelle haaaaaaaates hillary.  the obamas never invited the clintons to dinner during hillary&#39;s stint at the state department.</li>
<li>obama beat hillary in 2008... he had some pretty nasty (truthful) things to say about hillary and the clintons at the time... that shit doesn&#39;t go away.</li>
<li>obama allowed hillary to become sec. state (&quot;keep your friends close, and your enemies closer)</li>
<li>obama piltocal philosophy: rope a dope.  if trump is 4d chess, obama is blackbelt kung fu (i.e., you can&#39;t stop an overwhelming force.... rather, you need to allow/accelerate the force to pass by)</li>
<li>obama haaaaaaaates netanyahu... that was always pertty clear.</li>
<li>obama pulled off the iran deal in-spite of fierce (probably assassination attempt on kerry&#39;s life while in swtizerland... remember when kerry &quot;broke his leg on a bicycle accident&quot; ?  yea... bullshit.  pics or it didn&#39;t happen).  when kerry came out of the hospital, he looked like death warmed over - not a man with a broken leg ;)  ps.  the leaks on that iran deal were coming form hillary controlled blackberry&#39;s</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>PUTIN</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>through obama&#39;s term, it always appeared to be that obama and putin were going out of their way to convince us that they hated one another.<br/></li>
<li>putin haaaaaates netanyahu (noting most of the russian jews want nothing to do with israel)</li>
<li>the ukrain is under zio-facsist control, and they have been doing everything to de-thrown putin.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>SNOWDEN &amp; ASSANGE</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>i always believed that obama and snowden were very indirectly working together because glenn greenwald was the journalist who broke that story, and glenn was a HUUUUUGE supporter of obama.  snowden was working deep cover whitstleblower for obama to start the fued between the CIA and the NSA.  (no proof - just my opinion) -- always &quot;coincidence&quot; ? that putin offered safe haven for snowden.</li>
<li>assange haaaaaaaates hillary.  (i don&#39;t think that&#39;s in any doubt...)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>SAUDIS</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>most key princes are pedo-compromised.</li>
<li>israel uses pedophila extortion to control and extort key players to get what it wants.</li>
<li>the incoming saudi king is basically the Trump of saudi arabia (wants to drain the swamp)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>...ok so i could go on and on but need to get some work done, so let me wrap this up:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>obama spent his entire 2 terms basically mapping it all out.</p></li>
<li><p>sanders appeared to be the candidate who was going to beat hillary in the primaries (obama, putin and assange were all OK with that), but her™ zio-pedo-grip on the national political scene was surprisingly strong.</p></li>
<li><p>assange, putin and obama (along with &quot;old-guard&quot; intelligence community that had watched obama get taken for a ride the entire 2 terms) secretly worked together (behind the scenes) to make sure hillary was not elected (and that trump was elected)</p></li>
<li><p>when trump won, the zio-fascist cabal wouldn&#39;t let go.</p></li>
<li><p>while maintaining a &quot;front&quot; of disliking &quot;BO&quot; (even till today), trump has been secretly relying on obama, putin, assange and the &quot;old-guard&quot; intelligence community to map out a plan of attack... to basically take away israel&#39;s toys:</p></li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>hillary</strong> (and her henchman: pedosta pedo mafia, muslim brotherhood, etc.)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>saudi arabia</strong>&#39;s power players</p></li>
<li><p><strong>deep state</strong> puppets</p>

<ul>
<li>cia (not a complete takedown, but the JFK files have that cabal checked)</li>
<li>fbi (not a complete takedown, but las vegas scandal have that cabal checked)</li>
<li>hollywood &amp; MSM (not a complete takedown, but the pedo/molestation scandals have those cabals checked)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>north korea</strong> (the collapse of the underground nuke facilities seems to have silenced that sock puppet right quick)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>BOTTOM LINE:  there is one thing that obama, trump, putin and assange have in common... a mutual recognition that the zio-facsist cabal is evil and harmful to America and the world.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe that Trump could be pulling off all that he has w/o very significant assistance from top insiders.</p>

<p>Obama is a genius (he did beat the entire Clinton machine as an unknown black guy -- that&#39;s can&#39;t be underestimated nor forgotten).  Putin in a genius.  Assange is a genius.  And Donald (&quot;Your Fired!&quot;) Trump knows how to play the public like no other.  </p>

<p>Putin and Assange did collude with Trump, and thank God!</p>

<p>War is &quot;the art of deception&quot;, so you will never know (officially) that Trump and Obama are actually working together to drain the swamp.</p>

<p>Just my 0.02... </p>

<p>Cheers - thanks for asking.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for delivering, Sheasie! I’ve always thought Obama hated Hillary, but I never really considered that he could be on the same side as the names you listed. Your comment made me think of some of Donna Brazile’s revelations this week about how Obama ruined the DNC finances which seemed to hinder Clinton’s campaign. It’s worth considering whether or not that was done on purpose. When you get deep enough down the rabbit hole, nothing really surprises you anymore, so I’ll be keeping your theory in mind. Thanks again</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It actually does.  What president in modern history was hated so much by all these groups?  I cant think of a single one.  It legitimizes the idea he isn&#39;t and never was one of them, yet they all thought he was.  A billionaire business tycoon real estate guy.  A donor for 30 years.  The fact that he was never one of them never crossed their minds.  </p>

<p>Anyone who these factions hate is of interest because those factions are evil.  If wall street and the 2 party system and the media and the war machine hate someone, thats of interest to me.  Because I hate those factions of groups.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Specifically to mob connections? Yes. </p>

<p>I replied to another comment that it is impossible to know if he is under the control of some other interest group. Anything linking to interest groups (or Russia for that matter) have been anything but concrete. Considering I wouldn’t be against arresting 2/3 of government officials for corruption and conspiracy, is it that wrong to hope maybe the guy at the top isn’t part of the neo-fascist, Zionist party that all the Republicans and Democrats pretend to not be a part of? </p>

<p>His connection with Tesla has also intrigued me. There is nothing wrong with hoping he on our side, because we can’t prove he isn’t yet. At the end of the day, we are all pretending we are informed, when we really have no idea what goes on behind the closed doors of government. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, under that philosophy, anything the left media called fake news is also true? </p>

<p>The only organizations that seem to be critical of trump all have something in common. They are owned by one of 6 media conglomerates. It’s a catch 22. One side points to all this evidence of trump being corrupt, while the other side dismisses the “evidence” since it’s all made up by the deep state as propaganda. If trump wasn’t a part of the gang (deep state, 7th floor, etc), wouldn’t it make sense there would be a coordinated effort to discredit him?  </p>

<p>Hence the catch 22. In reality, taking any opinion besides being of aware of both is the biggest mistake.     </p>

People who read the Wikileaks knew it.  But it just hit the mainstream this week.  He was right.  he said Uranium One existed a long time ago.  We all knew it existed.  He was proven right the week before last.  He said he was wiretapped within the first few days of being in office.  People called him crazy and insane.  6 months later it comes out the FBI wiretapped Trump tower.  </p>

<p>We&#39;ve never seen someone like Trump in office before.  He&#39;s delivered on The TPP, he&#39;s going to repeal NAFTA, he&#39;s bringing back jobs.  </p>

<p>When was the last time a politician actually delivered on their campaign promises?</p>

<p>The media hates him.  The clintons hate him.  Bushes hate him.  Democrats hate him.  Republicans hate him.  The media hated him so much they openly colluded with the DNC to spend the entire campaign claiming he had no chance of winning, rigging the debates, and then spend the first 10 months of his presidency claiming he is a racist, bigot, sexist Russian bot.  Big business hates him.  Wall Street hates him.  The war machine hates him.  Bush I and II, Clinton, Bill and Hillary, Obama, all hate him.  </p>

<p>Ive never gotten a straight answer from any Trump hater.  Why do all these people hate him?  </p>

<p>Theres never been a hatred or disrespect of a president like this ever.  The Democrats literally have never ever said anything good about him.  Ever.  Thats completely unique</p>

Big business hates him.  Wall Street hates him.  The war machine hates him.  Bush I and II, Clinton, Bill and Hillary, Obama, all hate him.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Don&#39;t forget that a majority of Americans disapprove of him too.</p>

<p>Have you ever stopped to wonder if so many people hate him that they might actually have a good reason for it? Perhaps it&#39;s not just you and your fellow Trump supporters who know the real truth while everyone else is sitting in their own media bubble. Maybe the rest of the public actually realizes the truth and you are the one in the bubble.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying this is true, but I would at least appreciate it if you could even entertain the notion that it could be the case.</p>

<p>Hell, I&#39;ll even admit that myself. I hate the man, but I fully entertain the notion that maybe I just don&#39;t &quot;get it&quot;. Maybe I haven&#39;t seen the truth and I&#39;m just following the rest of the sheep, guided by the biased media. I don&#39;t think I am, but I would close minded if I dismissed that notion.</p>

<p>So far, I have yet to encounter a Trump supporter that can even admit that to me. They are so entrenched in this cult of personality that it has become almost religious to them. They 100% buy into the deep state, biased media, evil liberal, Antifa world that the alt-right media has built up for Trump and there is no way they are wrong about it.</p>

<p>I feel there are many people out there who feel this about Trump. They have no idea what to believe, but choose whatever the first thing they see or hear from &quot;what&#39;s popular&quot; because as you know socially acceptable opinions are always 100% correct. If you we&#39;re to ask them why, they would give you a non answer. Don&#39;t be that type of person.  Think for yourself.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Except I think that&#39;s the exact same reason why people like Trump, except they look for socially acceptable views within a counterculture instead of the overall culture. It&#39;s the same reason why the punk movement exists. They are displeased or maladjusted with society and they are looking for groups that they can share that displeasure with.</p>

<p>Trump and the alt-right movement speaks to them, and just like with the punk or goth movements you see people changing their lifestyles to adapt to it. Just look at t_d and how much uniformity there is amongst that group. They&#39;ve even developed it&#39;s own slang and practically talk the same.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying it is, but I&#39;m asking if they ever even stopped to consider it or even try rationalizing it from the other side. I have. I can see a lot of reasons why people like Trump. So far, I have yet to mean a Trump supporter that can even disagree with him on anything that isn&#39;t totally superficial.</p>

<p>No, I didn&#39;t mean to make that assumption at all. I&#39;m sorry if that&#39;s what I implied. I was just legitimately saying that I haven&#39;t met a Trump supporter, i.e. someone who voted for him and still back him, that has been able to admit that they disagree with him on any major issues or ways he&#39;s going about them.</p>

<p>Granted, I live in a very liberal state and don&#39;t often talk to many in person, but I do interact through Facebook with family and friends who still support him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Couldnt the opposite be true too?  Couldnt he be feared by these forces precisely because he would implement something they wholly disagree with?  That the dems and republicans and media and wall street and the war machine all hate him because he won&#39;t do their bidding?  </p>

<p>If he was pro wall street or pro media or pro status quo, why would be HATED.  Its one thing to be disliked.  I disagree with so and so&#39;s policies or he has some bad ideas or whatever.  Trumps opponents label him as nothing short of a racist, sexist white supremacist who supports hitler and colluded with the russians to rig the election.  That goes beyond disapproval or disliking someone.  Thats HATRED.  </p>

<p>And there is a real chance he is hated by these folks precisely because of that.  That the Dems were so cocky they thought they&#39;d win in a landslide and when Wikileaks exposed their corruption and Trump actually said he&#39;d put hillary in jail and started to go after Nafta and TPP and all these things and then actually won.  That the dems were so clueless they made up the Russian Trump hoax lie, and thought no one would find out or call them out on their bullshit.  </p>

<p>To be fair, I did answer this question. Yes, that could entirely be true, but I&#39;m also curious to know if you would entertain the notion that there are legitimate reasons for disliking him. Have given earnest thought into what negative things he&#39;s doing to this country and to our unity as a nation?</p>

<p>Are you at least willing to entertain the notion that there is a good, justified reason why everyone is against him?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Yes, he is hated because he is a vengeful person. He demands loyalty and if he&#39;s not given it he deems them his enemy and seeks retribution on them.</p>

<p>He also riles up his base and drives the us-vs-them narrative. He&#39;s dividing the country along with the help of the alt-right media and that&#39;s why a lot of people hate him.</p>

<p>What? Literally on the first day he was president he was spouting lies because of his fragile ego (Remember the biggest inauguration ever?). Since then he hasn&#39;t stopped lying and spreading BS. Everyone knew about uranium one a while ago because it happened a while ago and people went to jail because of it. He also said that obama wiretapped him. Thats another lie, Manafort was wiretapped by the fbi. And how exatacly was the dnc primary rigged? just becasuse they favored favoured clinton over an outsider =/= rigging.</p>

<p>Republicans hate him? who do you think voted for him? Big business hates him? wallstreet hates him? now your just making stuff up. Im sure wall street hates all those Goldman sachs in his cabinet. Him and his team are under investigation for collusion with russia. How many people that he has picked have been caught <strong>lying</strong> about their ties to Russia? Another one has been added to the list today thanks to the paradise papers. We don&#39;t say anything good about him because there has hardly been anything good to say. Poeple around the world think hes a laughing stock. Hes already failed or gone back on most the things he promised (healthcare for all, mexico paying for the wall etc)</p>

<p>Trump has a pretty extreme personality which I think contributes to the extreme reaction to him.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not a Trump hater, I think he&#39;s an ass and disagree with a lot of what he wants to do. I was hopeful we&#39;d see something positive come out of his presidency, because I want to country to do well, instead we have to here about Trump complain or brag about the most menial shit</p>

<p>As much as I&#39;d like to fanboy over Trump, because let&#39;s face it, it appears as though he has been shaking things up quite a bit, it doesn&#39;t necessarily follow that he&#39;s doing these things for the People and not for any other reason than to benefit his own camp of elites.</p>

<p>If George R.R. Martin ever taught me anything, it&#39;s that there is no clear division of Good vs Evil that exist in the world. It&#39;s just different factions battling for the symbolic Iron Throne. And while those who oppose the existing Tyrant may appear as the heroes to the suffering masses, there is no guarantee that the new rulers will be any better, regardless of how much we would like for this to be true. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Define legit? </p>

<p>Trump has opened people&#39;s eyes to what Washington is. I hear average citizens talking about conspiracies, the deep state, etc. I hear them talking about corruption, foreign influence, pay to play schemes, etc. This is not shit they talked about 2 years ago. </p>

<p>Some of this is a direct result of Trump, much of it is not. Most of it is a product of just Trump being in office. </p>

<p>All of it is a good thing for the future of our country. It&#39;s bumpy now, and evil people are trying to force the divide even more.. but the more people &quot;wake up&quot; (I fucking hate that term), the better it is for us in the long run. </p>

<p>So he&#39;s legit, but not necessarily because of his policies or anything like that. He&#39;s legit because he&#39;s in office, and that pisses people off and forces them to show their true colors. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Open minded Trump supporter here. Not a blind follower like those from that cult sub T_D. I like his policies, but I mostly voted against Clinton, and for her to be placed behind bars and out of the white house. To say nothing is being done is foolish. There&#39;s much at work behind the scenes that we probably wouldn&#39;t even be able to comprehend. And if Trump really is fighting corrupt forces, its wise to understand these things probably take a shit ton of time. It&#39;s not a movie, although what&#39;s been happening since he became president is interesting. I feel because of him alone it sparked more people to wake up further to the worlds corruption, myself included. If Clinton was president I feel there would be much less we know now, and we&#39;d be permanently doomed as a country. Whether Trump is legit or not, we have a better chance under him for things to change. And people can hate them all they want, but can&#39;t deny this fact. This a more open minded response if anything. I&#39;m not gonna try to convince you that he is this world savior, because I don&#39;t know and claiming he is would be foolish. These are the most interesting times to be alive in, and I think an awakening is occurring. I&#39;ve been a sleep for most of my life, like most people. I am awake now because of Trump, and I think this is the most important thing to consider.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have slowly come around. I still don&#39;t know what I believe, but I did some sleuthing on the original Q questions, and some things I found added some credibility to the notion that Trump may in fact be a force for good. If the indictments that go out this week include Podesta(s?), Huma and maybe Clinton, I think it will be a certainty. </p>

<p>Before I go on, I&#39;d point out that it&#39;s my current operating theory that Trump was actually approached by people in the IC or Military Intelligence to run. He would have had the funds to compete, and they likely knew he was clean enough to manage against oppo research. We know, for example, that the former administration was spying on him. It&#39;s unlikely that if anything significant was uncovered, it would have remained undisclosed to the public. Additionally, when the Billy Bush&quot; pussy tape&quot; came out, Clinton was getting eviscerated. Wikileaks was dropping bomb after bomb on her and her campaign, and the rumor was that WL had EVERYTHING. They ruined her coronation by showing Clinton cheated her way to the nomination, and the e-mail scandal wasn&#39;t going anywhere. The &quot;pussy tape&quot; was their biggest weapon they had in their arsenal for an &quot;October surprise,&quot; and that alone could have been telling.</p>

<p>Here a couple of other points that stood out to me. Almost all of his close staff is made of military men. Some of whom are legitimate spooks. We know Flynn served as Director of Intelligence at CentComm before becoming Obama&#39;s Director of National Intelligence. He served until Obama finally removed him in 2014. By that time, if any man knew of, or could intuit the scope of Obama&#39;s crimes, it would have been him.</p>

<p>He came on board Trump&#39;s campaign as an unofficial adviser in 2015. He is a democrat. This is strange for a number of reasons. Flynn also would have likely known that Comey and McCabe weren&#39;t disclosing what they knew to Trump. Manafort and Papadopolous would have also been made by someone like Flynn instantly (30+ years in military intelligence). Additionally, it is unlikely, by any stretch of the imagination, that someone with his background would have been unaware that his calls with foreign diplomats were being monitored. This strikes me as a distraction, a bit of Kabuki theater. You can make it look to the public like impropriety took place, reinforce the Trump/Russia narrative, and continue to get the Obama administration to move forward with their FISA warrants and surveillance. This would open the door to a non-partisan congressional investigation in the future. With your people in place to ensure it&#39;s integrity, eventually the public would learn.</p>

<p>The one bit of evidence that really made me pause though was Admiral Mike Rogers. Trump replaced the head of nearly every agency except one. The NSA. Admiral Rogers was the director of the NSA under Obama. On November 17, 2016, Rogers flew to New York and met with Trump in his tower without telling his superiors (Clapper and Obama). This is unprecedented for a military officer. Two days later, CIA rag WaPo airs a story suggesting that it</p>

<blockquote>
<p>caused consternation at senior levels of the administration, according to the officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal personnel matters.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/pentagon-and-intelligence-community-chiefs-have-urged-obama-to-remove-the-head-of-the-nsa/2016/11/19/44de6ea6-adff-11e6-977a-1030f822fc35_story.html?utm_term=.a7809790d401">The article</a> was basically to inform readers that after this meeting, IC heads pressured Obama to fire him. His visit with Trump ruffled some feathers. I assume that once Trump was elected, he waited until a SCIF was created in the tower, then went to fill him in on what happened. </p>

<p>It&#39;s interesting to point out that even Robert Mueller has a military background. He enlisted in the Marine Corps in 1968. He completed OCS at Paris Island, and went on to complete Army Ranger School and Army Jump School. He served as a rifle platoon commander and eventually became an aide-de-camp to 3rd Marine Division’s commanding general in Vietnam. Don&#39;t know how relevant that is, but it&#39;s something to think about.</p>

<p>Secondly, any serious attempt at investigating some of the most powerful people in the world is going to get eviscerated by the media. You could see how Ken Starr was treated in the 1990s. If you really wanted to do it, the best way would be to confuse them about who the target of the investigation is. Give them some patsies,and convince them that the real targets are Trump&#39;s people. I don&#39;t think that it&#39;s a coincidence that Uranium One and Fusion have popped back into the media light in the last couple of weeks. </p>

<p>Next, I have never in my entire life seen the top echelons of political and cultural power unite against a single person the way that they have with Trump. It was truly unprecedented. After they lost the election, you could see a shift in popular culture to try to influence the electoral college&#39;s vote. SNL ran skits with Clinton showing up at their house with sign boards to make sure they knew Trump was unfit and dangerous, and they should vote differently to save the country. Hollywood produced their little video with all of the a-listers they could enlist to do the same. They said he was unfit, and the EC should change their votes. This alone is mind-boggling. You would use cultural figures to undermine a constitutional process. </p>

<p>After the EC voted, the narrative about Russia went into overtime. Holdovers from the former administration obstructed and leaked whatever they could, and &#39;anonymous sources&#39; in the IC spread whatever salacious rumor they could in their friendly media outlets. Almost the entire media ran 24/7 Trump coverage. Politicians on both sides made it abundantly clear they were there to &#39;resist&#39; and obstruct. Talk about impeachment began almost as soon as they were cleaning up the inauguration. In Washington DC, and then tirelessly repeated on the airwaves, there was an endless stream of invectives. He is racist, he&#39;s a white supremacist, he&#39;s a traitor, he&#39;s a fascist, a misogynist, a tyrant, et cetera.  </p>

<p>I think what happened in Saudia Arabia was more &quot;evidence&quot; that something very, very big is happening, and I don&#39;t think it&#39;s going to play out the way most Americans expect. Mohammed bin Salman is an interesting character. He&#39;s reforming their economy, society, and his country&#39;s religion. It&#39;s interesting that Trump&#39;s first major foreign visit was there. It&#39;s easy to suggest that it was about arms sales, but given the light of recent events, who knows. The fact that Jared Kushner made an unannounced visit last week, just before this purge began is interesting. The fact that Alwaleed bin Talal was one of the number of princes that were arrested is also worth noting. He had major donations to the Clinton Foundation, used Tony Podesta&#39;s lobbying firm, and owned the Four Seasons at Mandalay Bay. I don&#39;t know that I believe in coincidences anymore. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Af9FNFxhKw&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be">This video</a> is also worth watching. I never saw it until recently. It was a speech given to the CIA. He&#39;s not talking to the press, nor the American public, but he&#39;s clearly trying to tell them something. He even reiterates by saying, &quot;Do you understand?&quot; Is he talking about removing the &quot;5th column?&quot; </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what I believe anymore. My entire worldview has been upended in a year. It&#39;s hard to know what is &quot;true&quot; when so much is deception. To the extent that anyone can trust their &quot;gut instinct,&quot; mine is telling me that Trump is actually here to change the world for the better, but that means nothing, right? It&#39;s just a feeling. I also feel that we&#39;re on the cusp of this great event. I don&#39;t know anything anymore. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look at how both parties, celebrities and the media treat him and then tell me that he is part of their system. </p>

<p>Yes, he has to compromise with them on some things, sometimes there is no choice (the system is too strong), and sometimes I think he makes mistakes, but I think it&#39;s very clear that he is not welcome by the elites, because he is not going to do what they usually expect from a president. </p>
