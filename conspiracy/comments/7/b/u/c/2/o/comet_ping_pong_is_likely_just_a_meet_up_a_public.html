<p>I think a lot of us are more interested in the money laundering aspect of Comet Ping Pong, why it holds fundraisers for political candidates, and what it&#39;s potential function is regarding the human trafficking taking place in DC. </p>

<p>Could it simply be a place for clients to meet with their &quot;pimp&quot; (Who I assume would be JA, considering his vast wealth and power/influence within the city, and his blatant pedophilic Instagram content.)</p>

<p>I noticed in a few of those photos he is even flashing around large amounts of what looks to be foreign cash. Boasting to his Pedo buddies online following a &quot;transaction&quot; perhaps? </p>

<p>Creepy...

<p>I think the pizza place is just a hub for them to launder their trafficking/art money,  hold pre-transaction meetings with clients, and at night time it&#39;s a bit of a &quot;hangout&quot; for the pedos with the pedophilic and satanic imagery, live music, ect.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, people here and on T_D pushed the idea that Comet Ping Pong had a basement that was used for child abuse.</p>

<p>Specifically, <a href="https://imgur.com/a/3s9Lh">these pictures</a> were used to argue that secret tunnels were being built under Comet Ping Pong (because there was no building permit for them). </p>

<p>And the video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6vvx2rHid0&amp;amp;t=37m50s">#pizzagate: A Primer</a> —with over 334,000 views and posted here multiple times— claims (at 37:50), &quot;Here is a clip from a video taken by Frank Winstead. Frank claims that the screaming and crying that is heard coming from inside Comet Ping Pong are the cries of children being beaten and raped.&quot;</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHXBrEXmowo">original video from Frank Winstead</a> makes no such claims.</p>

<p>So you can claim all you want that nobody claimed there was a secret child abusing dungeon under Comet Ping Pong, but some of us have good enough memory to remember that&#39;s not true.</p>

If you want the original thread, here it is <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1528096">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1528096</a></p>

<hr/>

<p>This is very interesting I&#39;m going to do some digging into the costs of actually using the brands of tomato&#39;s he claims and looking at the costs.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Comet&#39;s lightly cooked sauce is made from a combination of tomatoes, including heirlooms (such as Brandywines), beefsteaks, Romas, and some Pennsylvania-grown San Marzanos, says farmer Mark Toigo of Toigo Orchards.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This quote has my eyebrows raised.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The problem, as more than one chef pointed out, is that you can&#39;t realistically use heirlooms for sauces in restaurants. Finding consistent, perfectly ripe specimens would be nearly impossible. And even if you could, the expense of turning those heirlooms into, say, a pizza sauce would be prohibitive. It might cost you $16 in heirloom tomatoes to make enough sauce for a single pizza, MacQuaid guesses. That pie would have to sell for about $45, he suggests.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>edit: It more looks like he is just fibbing on his sauce as I would expect most restaurants do. I&#39;m doing the calculations and If he used 4000lbs of tomatoes and lets say they are all heirlooms (pricey) lets give it a 3$ a lb for a wholesale price, thats all 12 grand to supply your pizza shop for the year, well just sauce anyway. I don&#39;t know the financials of a pizza restaurant so I can&#39;t speculate any further.</p>

<p>Perhaps someone more in tune with whole sale food purchasing could chime in, probably not though. Although I do wonder how he manages to find 4000 lbs of quality heirloom tomatoes at a good price, and further more he has claimed before that he used 10 tons of tomatoes per year, and has about 35 employee&#39;s per restaurant.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.metroweekly.com/2015/04/from-scratch-james-alefantis/">http://www.metroweekly.com/2015/04/from-scratch-james-alefantis/</a></p>

<p>But 10 tons of tomatoes for sauce is a different story, thats 30,000 for just your sauce and counting employee salary and usual business costs, that sounds like a tough profit margin to hit in my opinion. He has to be lying about the sauce its not sounding feasible to get 10000 lbs of organic heirloom tomatoes.</p>

<p>If we do 12,000$ for 4000 lbs of heirloom tomatoes, mixed with 6000lbs of shit tomatoes its still 18-20,000 for just your sauce. Not counting cheese and how how he claims &quot;EVERYTHING is made from scratch&quot;. No way he could realistically make profit on an operation like that. (Please I would like someone more knowledge on these topics to chime in)</p>

<hr/>

<p>Edit: math was wrong</p>

<p>20,000 lbs of tomatoes is roughly equal to about 10000 cans of 28 OZ tomato sauce. A typical pizza from what I have read around is roughly 3-6 ounces of sauce. To make life easy lets say he gets 5 pizza&#39;s out of every can.</p>

<p>That&#39;s 50,000 pizza&#39;s he can make... 50,000 pizzas for a whole year of course he states they used canned san marzano to fill in the gaps of sauce availability (few weeks he states).</p>

<p>Lets say on an average week day he sells 100 pizzas. Thats an acceptable number(probably more). He is only open for 4 and a half hours on a regular weekday (not friday).</p>

<p>Now fridays and saturdays he is open for 11 hours, 11:30 am to 10:45 pm. These are where the profits are.</p>

<p>Pizza chains can do hundreds of pies a day, some restaurants do 200-300 a day on average weekends from my research. A dominoes in cali can do 1000 pies a day.</p>

<p>For how popular this guy claims it is, I don&#39;t think these are over estimates on pizza numbers per day I could be wrong.</p>

<p>52 weeks in a year 2 &quot;busy&quot; days of friday saturday = 104 days</p>

<p>104 busy days + 52 sundays = 156 busier days.</p>

<p>Sunday is open from 11:30am to 9:30pm So not quite as busy of a day but still busy so maybe 150-200 pies on sundays.</p>

<p>Factoring in holidays you got about 6 or 7 days where it would be closed. (christmas eve, and christmas, thanksgiving, new years eve, etc)</p>

<p>to make math easy lets just say 355 days a year he is open. out of those 355 156 are busy days with 10+ hours. 199 regular days with 4 hours.</p>

<p>156 x 200 = 31,200 pizza and 199 x 100 = 19,900 pizza</p>

<p>So this man makes 50,000 pizza&#39;s a year based on his grand statements. And the amount of sauce that is required to do that is 20,000 lbs of tomatoes. (10 tons)</p>

<p>So really I&#39;m only proving that his sauce story is only factual if he actually uses 10 tons. But why would he claim to only use 2 tons in other articles?</p>

<p>How that factors in with basements at bucks I don&#39;t know. But I just rrreally doubt he cans his sauce ahead of time like he says.</p>

<p>Even if he got his tomatoes wholesale at 1$ a lb thats 20,000$ just for your sauce. NOT even factoring in all your from scratch ingredients and of course CHEESE holy crap, how is this guy even making profit?</p>

<p>Then you factor in that he has ANOTHER company process and can the tomatoes for him, transport it to him thats more money. But the question really is, where is the money coming from? He can&#39;t possibly profit that much from just this place. He has buck&#39;s as well. I wonder about their financials as well.</p>

<hr/>

<p>My point is the financial aspect, and how there is no feasible way he could pay for 10 tons of tomatoes and send it to a processing plant (more $$) then have it delivered(more $$) If he somehow managed to get heirloom tomatoes for 1$ a pound (yea right buddy) then he still spends 20 grand on JUST sauce. Now think about all the other costs that would come with a pizza restaurant...</p>

<p>Employee&#39;s, taxes, utilities, rent(if applicable), HEALTH INSURANCE my god every employer knows how expensive it is now. (thanks obama).</p>

<p>But also that he has conflicted the 10 ton statement with a more recent one stating he only uses 2 tons a year.</p>

<p>Edit: Where does he store the 10,000 cans at bucks that isn&#39;t already being used by bucks for food storage itself?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>TLDL: Anon claimed to have hacked the encrypted part of CPP&#39;s website (<a href="https://ibb.co/hOjnyG">https://ibb.co/hOjnyG</a>), found CP (images and movies) and reported it to DCMP.  The CPP network included 9 different servers across the globe, including Berlin, Germany. It appears the files were able to be sold through CPP.  Shortly after the report was made, the false flag occurred (magically shooting CPP&#39;s hard drive). After the false flag, Anon spoke to Det. Marcus Stevens at DCMP and reporting his findings, offering to help DCMP in any way. CP cannot be disseminated, so Anon had to describe what he found and how. After about a month, Stevens stop communicating. </p>

<p>Given the lack of interest by DCMP, Anon turned to the FBI, DHS, and the NYPD. No agency pursued the report, however, Anon said NYPD was interested but inferred their hands were tied. In desperation, Anon went to the press. Some media people claimed interest (FOX 5), but implied they couldn&#39;t cover the story.</p>

<p>During the time Anon reported what he found, his mail was opened and a prowler was found outside his house, hiding in the bushes. The suspect lived two states away and was charged with vehicle prowling. In addition, some of his property was damaged in a separate incident. Anon said he lives in a good, quiet neighborhood. </p>

The intelligence agencies can add little twists into their operations that make them seem far-fetched ... violate occam&#39;s razor and you&#39;re halfway to a successful cover-up. They own the media and the mainstream story, the key now is to also own the &quot;truther&quot; story from the beginning. Make it so neither side has the answer.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That isn&#39;t true at all. Yeah there were people looking into the possibility of there being a basement there but it was never, among the serious investigators who were working on reddit and then voat, a central part of the investigation and it was never a confirmed thing and only maybe a couple of people ever tried to push the idea that there was a sex dungeon in the basement of CPP.</p>

<p>Yes there were terrible Wordpress blogs and bad infographics and bad information put out. But you can&#39;t dismiss the whole thing on the basis of that, nor can you lump every single PG investigator in with all of the crap that anyone who talked about PG ever put out including those who were working to try to make it sound crazy in order to build up a straw man to easily debunk officially.</p>

<p>A sex dungeon in CPP was never a central thing - the media made out like that was what the whole thing was about when in reality it was something that had been suggested or pushed by a small minority. There were plenty of professional investigators and researchers involved, plenty of independent journalists, tons of people across the world were pitching in and they discovered a hell of a lot of genuine, frightening and damning information. Even if a minority pushed some stupid untrue stuff it doesn&#39;t detract from everything that was discovered and it doesn&#39;t excuse the media from their blatant warping of the whole thing and their refusal to address the serious concerns and issues that were raised in favour of pushing the sex dungeon myth as somehow being the key aspect upon which the whole PG investigation was based.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was very very clear at the time that he was not a genuine investigator of PG. There was absolutely no evidence that he had been involved in any of the investigation, had communicated on any of the forums or threads about it or anything. Other investigators took video when they went anywhere, for proof. If this guy was genuinely looking for evidence then he would have taken a camera, not a gun. The only thing he shot was the hard drive? The police claimed they had debunked PG, then the media repeated that ad nauseam, only for a FOIA request to discover that the police lied and they hadn&#39;t investigated any of it at all. You&#39;d think if a man with no prior criminal history had turned up somewhere so convinced children were in danger that he&#39;d risked his life and his freedom by going with a gun to &#39;free them&#39; that a legitimate police force would have at least checked out the claims given that harm to children was being alleged, instead of lying and pretending they had looked into it when they hadn&#39;t. You&#39;re asking us to believe that not one police officer thought, hang on a second, this person is SO worried about kids being harmed here that he took a gun and shot it in there, we should probably make damn sure that there&#39;s nothing to it?</p>

<p>But to you it makes sense that a person who had never had a criminal history or a history of this kind of behavior, a person for whom there was no evidence he&#39;d been engaging in PG online, would risk his life, his reputation, his safety, his freedom etc, on the basis of some crazy conspiracy theory that, were you to believe it and understand its implications, would involve extremely dangerous people with enormous power and wealth and a hell of a lot to lose - you believe THAT. And then you believe that an otherwise ordinary up-til-now mentally healthy person taking such huge risks on the belief of some heinous criminal activity taking place would not at all pique the interest of the police and that the police would instantly, without investigation, dismiss this person&#39;s claims right away.</p>

<p>And yet somehow, you&#39;re telling others to act seriously? How about you start by thinking seriously!!</p>

<p>You cant say that for sure. Its seems pretty obvious that he is not mentally healthy now though. That&#39;s the thing with crazy conspiracy theories, some crazy people latch on to them. </p>

<p>Iam thinking seriously. If this thing is as big as some claim, like that police are complicit in the cover up, reddit or 4 chan &quot;investigators&quot; don&#39;t stand a chance. </p>

<p>None of you are genuine investigators. You think you are, but your efforts and antics are impeding the actual professionals. Going to Comet Pizza and taking cell phone videos is not an investigation, its a person that is living a fantasy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have to be honest here. I thought pizzagate sounded ridiculous. I have been into conspiracies since 9/11 and the start of the Iraq war but took a break after Sandy Hook because as a mom, it was too hard to read about at all. So, I heard about pizzagate from Stephen Colbert and what I now see are other disinfo &quot;personalities&quot;  first. It sounded so silly. Hillary eating babies, a guy looking for a basement when there was not a basement, I mean a damn pizza parlor itself sounds ridiculous with out knowing the facts. Now after waking back up and reading this sub, I see it is a very real thing. I wish more people knew the truth. And if I ever have a few months to live well...someone&#39;s at the top of my list! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I mean they probably don&#39;t have a literal sex dungeon right underneath a restaurant in the middle of a highly populated cosmopolitan area.  It&#39;s possible, but unlikely... that&#39;s how you get caught.  Wealthy, connected people usually do this stuff on large private properties</p>

<p>That does not imply that nothing strange/illegal/immoral is going on there - it likely is as you said, a place of business for these people, where they can meet up and exchange money/promises</p>
