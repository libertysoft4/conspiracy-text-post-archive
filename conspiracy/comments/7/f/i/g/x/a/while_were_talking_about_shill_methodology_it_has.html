        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>...that is, posts that are intended to draw in the element or ideologues they are assigned to ridicule and discredit, where they coordinate and swarm with condescending and dismissive talking points to create the appearance of a strong and undeniable public opinion.  In their coordination they also upvote the post to guarantee it front page visibility.  It&#39;s literally designed to create illusory public opinions for sheep to follow and to shame all dissent into silence.  We need to recognize these posts which are frequenting the front page more and more and call them out.  They&#39;re easy to spot.  Their headlines almost always state a controversial blanket generalization as indisputable fact.  I wouldn&#39;t argue in their own set-up forum, just a downvote will do, but we should take note of the issues they are gunning for, and raise our voices even louder, more fearlessly.  They only operate in a world of appearances, but those attuned to truth cannot and will not be misled in this way.  </p>

I&#39;ve recently noticed a lot of users that seem to have a larger than normal knowledge base of the subject they seem to be defending, yet there are obvious and easily debunkable &quot;seeds&quot; in their well-written comments- blatant misquotes, poor &quot;iirc&quot; citations- things a novice should be able to catch.

<p>That&#39;s what we know to be true. If you&#39;re interested in whistle blowers, check out <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/shills/comments/5pzcnx/shill_confessions_and_additional_information/?st=izz0ga8r&amp;amp;sh=43621acd">Shill Confessions and Additional Information</a>. Since we know that many of these governments and corporations hire shills, some of them will eventually break their non-disclosure agreements and blow the whistle. Just be careful because it&#39;s difficult to prove that a whistleblower is legit. They would not want to prove their identity because that could get them fired or sued by their employer. This means some of the confessions could just be trolls. If you want to stick just with information we know is true, see the megathread. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, no it’s not a lack of self awareness. It’s a lack of the necessary skills to grasp the subject. The same lack of skills stops you from judging yourself as incapable of grasping the subject. You may be aware and introspective, but still coming to the wrong conclusion. </p>

<p>“Chicken playing chess” would probably just be a variation on the argument from ignorance, but I think it is different. Because the point is asserted as true because of the owners ignorance. Instead, the owner believes the point is true because the owners ignorance. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, you have a point, and what you say isn&#39;t untrue, but nevertheless, there are coordinated shills that really are damaging the free and open discourse of this sub, making it appear as it is not, and really taking a notch out of the potential of this sub.  I value this sub so much because it&#39;s one of the few places people can challenge the official narratives and discuss their perspectives openly without social backlash.  We live in touchy times, and even the most innocent questioning can turn the angry hordes against you.  Yes, calling someone a shill is an easy way to dismiss them, and in that sense, I can understand the rule, but that doesn&#39;t mean that there are not paid and coordinated shills literally trying to misinform and alter perceptions and thinking through deceitful means.  And that is a wicked thing at a such a dire and critical time in human history, and devalues the beauty and potential of a free exchange of information.  You hang around here long enough and you see the patterns and the tone change drastically during business hours.  You recognize the pattern of redundant tactics, you catch the buzzwords, note the provocations, and see the odd voting patterns.  Sure, there can be shill hysteria, but shills are real, and they&#39;re bad, m&#39;kay?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The shill accusation is nothing new, but we have huge numbers of people attempting to claim that it is. </p>

<p>People have been dismissing others&#39; opinions for decades by calling them names. Examples include sheeple, conspiracy nuts, tin foil whackjobs, libtards, Drumpf supporters, idiots, retards, truthers, etc.</p>

<p>People today will attack you for your comment history if you posted in certain subreddits, regardless if you were in that sub to agree or disagree. Some people will find stuff in your history from last year to discredit what you&#39;re saying recently, so this has been going and and will continue to go on for as long as the internet exists. People like to single out the shill accusation as something that&#39;s entirely new, but it&#39;s not. It&#39;s just a different version of the same old discrediting tactics. I&#39;ve even had people tell me that I shouldn&#39;t be spreading information about shills because it will ruin conversations due to the influx of shill accusations. Those accusations would be significantly reduced if these governments and corporations required their workers to disclose ties to their employer instead of trying to blend in and manipulate people. They should be the ones who are to blame for the influx of shill accusations, not the people trying to educate others about the practice.</p>

<p>Shills have existed for a very long time. Even the word &quot;shill&quot; is at least 100 years old, used to describe people paid by gamblers/auctioneers to impersonate regular people in order to manipulate a crowd. <a href="https://www.etymonline.com/word/shill">https://www.etymonline.com/word/shill</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again good info, and refreshing that someone sees it.  You talked a bit about ad hominem, a term I admit I only learned recently after ranting about the very thing on Facebook.  Once you&#39;re wise to it, you see it in exhausting repetition.  It&#39;s the go-to tactic of a feeble mind, nothing but a diversion from addressing a topic head on.  It is fascinating how deep they&#39;ll dig through your comment history looking for something to discredit you.  The second they start to bring that up, is the second you know for sure who and what you&#39;re dealing with.  Fucking cowards grasping at straws for deflection, nothing but dirty tricks and dishonest intentions.  I think the real ones to blame are the shills themselves.  It&#39;s like how the Nazi regime would have been powerless without the cooperation of the people.  In my opinion, anyone who profits off the seeding of misinformation and the suppression of the truth in such a dire and critical time in human history is guilty of a grave sin against humanity that won&#39;t go unchecked without its repercussions.  What a mark of wickedness to taint the purity and potential of a revolutionary, worldwide, open, and free communications network to push a self-serving and divisive agenda!  I can sleep at night after hundreds of downvotes, ridicule and scorn.  I hope the inner, gnawing guilt of shills haunts them and drives them to madness like Judas or Poe&#39;s &quot;Tell-Tale Heart&quot;.  But it won&#39;t,  You can&#39;t break through to such hardened hearts. They&#39;ll be like fools arguing on a sinking ship, unaware of the real danger, until the moment frigid water fills their lungs, snuffs their dreams, and pulls their corrupted souls into the black abyss.  </p>

<p>But I digress...  Thanks again for the perspectives.  It&#39;s time to flip over the rock, expose them, and watch these shadow creatures scurry as they get scorched in the impartial light of truth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I really hate to polarize any issue.  The &quot;us and them&quot; mentality isn&#39;t serving us, but hurting us.  I was called a &quot;radical centrist&quot; today, fuck it. I&#39;m very disenchanted with the left and the right and US politics in general, so I&#39;d like to believe I&#39;m not taking sides.  I&#39;m on the side against deception, and a little content to just sit back and watch it all cave in on itself.  That said, I see PLENTY of pro-DNC shilling in this sub, and it&#39;s often the most arrogant and deceptive.  Everybody is freaked out, so everyone has to choose a side and commit to it, and now we&#39;re divided right down the middle and snarling at each other like distracted dogs, but we&#39;re on the same sinking ship, and the elite are having a good laugh from their beach chairs.  I think one of the chief challenges of humanity in this time is to wake up and outsmart this divide and conquer tactic, the crux of which is the us-and-them mentality that has been bred into us since birth in this long-corrupt system.  Trump is the ultimate polarizer.  To defeat him is to defeat the polarized mentality.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I agree, but it&#39;s far more than this sub.  The whole world is spellbound by this us and them mentality and it is very effectively fracturing us and taking away our capacity to unite and solve real problems.  I wrote a poem about it: </p>

<p>Like those who tussle in sinking sand,
only hasten their gritty fate,
Here we wrestle on a sinking vessel,
unaware the hour is late.</p>

<p>We&#39;re just anrgy dogs on two sides of a sinking boat, each feeling righteous and blaming the other, at each others throats as we choke on rising sea water.  I really believe if shills are shilling anything, its simply this mentality.  It keeps us distracted and easily manipulated.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well thanks for the pep talk, but you&#39;re mistaken.  It&#39;s not about me.  In that regard you are correct.  It&#39;s about shaping popular opinion, because most are not like me, and are prone to follow what &quot;smarter people&quot; espouse as truth.  As more and more people have become distrustful of the mainstream media and feel unable to discuss ideas openly on Facebook for fear of social shaming, they&#39;ve been coming here, where ideas are discussed in greater depth than tweets and memes, and where one can remain anonymous and speak relatively freely without fear of blowback.  So yes, TPTB, are aware that conspiratorial ideas are infiltrating mainstream thought and its fucking with their ability to decieve and control.  And yes, they send out shills in these forums to influence popular opinion.  I&#39;m not so egotistical to assume they care about my personal ideologies, but you are apparently are egotistical enough to feel the need to snidely dismiss and condescend.  Bravo, champ.  Go get &#39;em!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I really hate to polarize any issue.  The &quot;us and them&quot; mentality isn&#39;t serving us, but hurting us.  I was called a &quot;radical centrist&quot; today, fuck it. I&#39;m very disenchanted with the left and the right and US politics in general, so I&#39;d like to believe I&#39;m not taking sides.  I&#39;m on the side against deception, and a little content to just sit back and watch it all cave in on itself.  That said, I see PLENTY of pro-DNC shilling in this sub, and it&#39;s often the most arrogant and deceptive.  Everybody is freaked out, so everyone has to choose a side and commit to it, and now we&#39;re divided right down the middle and snarling at each other like distracted dogs, but we&#39;re on the same sinking ship, and the elite are having a good laugh from their beach chairs.  I think one of the chief challenges of humanity in this time is to wake up and outsmart this divide and conquer tactic, the crux of which is the us-and-them mentality that has been bred into us since birth in this long-corrupt system.  Trump is the ultimate polarizer.  To defeat him is to defeat the polarized mentality.  </p>
