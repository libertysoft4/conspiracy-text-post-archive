        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">52</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2017-11-27 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/LonelyIslandIsWoke.html">LonelyIslandIsWoke</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Shills rotate between a few well-known strategies that are pretty easy to see once you are aware of them. That is why the moderators have chosen to sidebar this article, and if you haven&#39;t read it, you need to:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2012/07/22/1112509/-The-Gentleperson-s-Guide-to-Forum-Spies">https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2012/07/22/1112509/-The-Gentleperson-s-Guide-to-Forum-Spies</a></p>

<p>The key to defeating these strategies is to understand what they do. Shilling strategies generally boil down to an attempt to get you to <em>stop having a productive discussion of the truth</em>.</p>

<p>The shills are just as happy if you start calling them names, give sarcastic replies, become frustrated and stop posting entirely, or start using their own strategies back. Because the shills win when no meaningful information is exchanged, and quality drops from real research to silly gossip and conjecture:</p>

<p>&quot;By implementing continual and non-related postings that distract and disrupt (trolling ) the forum readers they are more effectively stopped from anything of any real productivity. If the intensity of gradual dilution is intense enough, the readers will effectively stop researching and simply slip into a &#39;gossip mode.&#39; In this state they can be more easily misdirected away from facts towards uninformed conjecture and opinion. The less informed they are the more effective and easy it becomes to control the entire group in the direction that you would desire the group to go in.&quot;</p>

<p>How do we defeat this? </p>

<ol>
<li><em>Always</em> make high quality, fact-based posts and comments. Never shitpost. </li>
<li><em>Always</em> back up everything you say with reliable sources. Prove your claims.</li>
<li><em>Always</em> respond to shills with facts and logical arguments that refute their errors.</li>
<li><em>Never</em> make a sarcastic response that doesn&#39;t refute the disinformation</li>
<li><em>Never</em> use the 25 disinformation tactics (read them, then read your comment history and see how many you&#39;re using)</li>
<li>If you see disinformation strategies in a post, explain <em>why</em> it is using a known disinformation tactic. This raises the consciousness level of the neutral reader more than just saying &quot;fuck off, shill!&quot;</li>
<li>When you have a disagreement, avoid an immediate emotional reactions. Instead, take a few minutes to construct a calm, fact-based response showing why the other person is wrong. This helps clarify points of disagreement, and edifies both parties and their readers (look at how Socrates and Plato argued for an example).</li>
<li>Moderators can aggressively police shilling <em>strategies</em>, which cleans up the board while allowing free speech for anyone wanting to add to the discussion.</li>
</ol>

<p>The meme of &quot;don&#39;t feed the trolls&quot; is aimed at low-consciousness people who can&#39;t prove the shills wrong. Readers of r/conspiracy are quite capable of <em>defeating</em> shills by shining the light of truth on these cockroaches.</p>

<p>Indeed, this is what they fear more than anything else:</p>

<p>&quot;However in some cases where the forum members are highly educated and can counter your disinformation with real facts and linked postings, you can then &#39;abort&#39; the consensus cracking by initiating a &#39;forum slide.&#39;&quot;</p>

<p>In other words, if the shills are constantly faced by a barrage of facts and links refuting their disinformation, they will be <em>forced</em> to stop.</p>

For example, you bring up the blockade on Yemen, the subsequent deaths of children, and how this is a war crime, they will talk about Iran, how Yemen is a breeding ground for terrorism, how Obama began the campaing not Trump.</p>

<p>When they do this, just refocus them by re-quoting your original point and ask them to address that. They might bring up other irrelevant points but if you continue to refocus on the main point(e.g. the fact that the blockade is a war crime), they will summon their bots and mass downvote your comments but will stop replying to you. </p>

<p>OPs post had a good point that mods should be looking out for shill <em>tactics</em> not perspectives they dont like. if someone isnt using logic and instead resorts to ad hominems and inflaming language I feel like that should be moderated. Remember, the biggest weakness of shills is that <em>they know they are arguing from the wrong</em>. Their arguments dont have a leg to stand on. IF they did, they wouldnt need to shill that perspective!</p>

<p>nothing. I was called a shill repeatedly last night when I went several rounds with some rabid PGers.

    <div class="md"><p>OK, here&#39;s the problem with this strategy. Half the links I&#39;ve seen people post trying to prove a point are bullshit. I call them out on the bullshit, they just get annoyed and say I&#39;m either delusional or call me a shill. So how is that helpful?</p>

<p>And posting a giant wall of text doesn&#39;t mean you are right, it just means you have found a lot of links that say what you are trying to say. Read the links, interpret the links for yourself, and defend what you are using to show that you have the correct point. Another reason why walls of text and links are a bad idea, because it makes it nearly impossible to have a discussion about all of them.</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t explain <em>why</em> the link is incorrect, then you&#39;re invoking a logical fallacy:</p>

<p>&quot;ad Hominem Fallacy: (abusive and circumstantial): the fallacy of attacking the character or circumstances of an individual who is advancing a statement or an argument instead of seeking to disprove the truth of the statement or the soundness of the argument. Often the fallacy is characterized simply as a personal attack. &quot;</p>

<p>many are based on a false premise and would need a history lesson and not just a few sentences to refute, if someone is dealing from a profound basic misunderstanding of how reality works then there really isn&#39;t much that can change this short of a multi-page explanation that they probably won&#39;t read anyway. </p>

<p>While both sides do that, I actually see the Left doing it more; and the reason why that stands out to me more, is because it&#39;s the Left who continually claim to have the moral high ground.  The Right don&#39;t try and wrap themselves in Gandhi&#39;s toga on the one hand, and then call people who disagree with them &quot;tards,&quot; on the other.</p>

<p>That&#39;s what I&#39;m really tired of; the patronising condescension.  The attitude that whatever the Left believe in is supposedly just self-evident historical inevitability, and that if you disagree, there is no place for you other than for you to be supposedly destroyed.  My attitude now is, let me be destroyed, if that is the case; because I do not want to be among such people.</p>
