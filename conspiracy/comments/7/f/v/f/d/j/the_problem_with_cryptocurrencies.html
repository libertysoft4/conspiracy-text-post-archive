        <h3 class="title">The Problem with Cryptocurrencies...?</h3>
        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">14</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2017-11-27 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/DereIzNoPoint.html">DereIzNoPoint</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Firstly I have to say I&#39;m not an expert on cryptocurrencies, far from it. I just ask questions to clarify my understanding of them and economics more broadly. I put this in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> because a lot of these crypto people seem to be too optomistic about it, and seem to believe governments will eventually adopt digital currencies for the benefit of their citizens (people like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AecPrwqjbGw">Antonopoulos</a>).</p>

<p>Now a common criticism I hear of cryptos, particularly Bitcoin (since that&#39;s the best known), is that they&#39;re a &#39;Ponzi scheme&#39;, and that they&#39;re based only on faith. Well, aren&#39;t fiat currencies based only on faith? Everyone just accepts money has value because our government says so; is that really better than the faith people have in cryptos? Even diamonds are only valuable mainly because we believe them to be valuable; is that not so? Yes they have some uses, but their price is justified mainly through our belief they&#39;re worth that much. Bitcoin has uses too, but it&#39;s price is mainly from the faith in it.</p>

<p>So I don&#39;t put much value on such criticisms of cryptos. To me the actual problem with cryptos is that the people who run the world will eventually clamp down on it. We know that the world pretty much runs on keeping the fiat currency scheme going on forever. All wars are fought for the money system controlled by private central banks. Print more money out of nothing and charge interest on it, thus keeping people enslaved to debt they can never pay off forever. Literally everything governments and the-powers-that-be do is to keep this system going. Why would they allow currencies to exist outside of their control? They destroyed Libya <a href="http://www.truth-out.org/news/item/424">exactly because they controlled their own currency for the benefit of their citizens</a>.</p>

<p>So if cryptos are genuinely outside of this scheme of paper money, then eventually they will want to destroy it or bring it under their control. I&#39;m pretty sure this is the ultimate goal; I seriously doubt government or banks will eventually adopt cryptos in order to help the ordinary man in the street. For example, if all governments (through a declaration from the IBS, or whatever the relevant authority is) declare cryptos are illegal, what are you going to do with yours? You won&#39;t be able to legally convert them into assets or fiat currencies; then what? You&#39;ll lose everything you put into them.</p>

<p>Is this a reasonable concern, or not?</p>

<p>EDIT: I&#39;m not so much interested in the technical details of cryptos, e.g. whether they&#39;re assets or currencies, etc., I&#39;m more concerned about whether banks and governments will try to clamp down on them or not.</p>

<p>Yes, but coersion is the basis of all property so it doesn&#39;t really bug me when it comes to dollars.</p>

<p>Cryptocurrencies don&#39;t threaten the governments. That&#39;s just them marketing themselves as rebellious or edgy lifestyle choices. </p>

<p>Cryptocurrencies might help make tax evasion, money laundering, or other crimes easier...but governments will eventually find ways to detect the behavior and prosecute it all the same.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep, it&#39;s fucked. The IRS currently considers cryptocurrency property and not &#39;real&#39; currency for tax purposes. If you bought bitcoin a year ago and use some of it to buy something worth $5 today, you have technically made a long-term capital gain, which you must report to the IRS, and for which you would owe 15% or about $0.40 in tax. Even worse, if you bought bitcoin less than a year ago, you will have made a short-term capital gain and, assuming you make more than about $40k/yr, owe an even greater percentage (if you make less than that you&#39;d actually pay less however). Being paid in cryptocurrency is similarly subject to short-term capital gains tax.           </p>

<p>I should note however, that buying cryptocurrency or trading one cryptocurrency for another does not (to my knowledge) incur a tax liability.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a reasonable concern, and one that I share.  If cryptocurrencies really are a viable threat to the current banking system, then why have the been permitted?  A fully digital currency is every government&#39;s wet dream- no more tax evasion, full economic control, protection from counterfiet opearations.  Banks don&#39;t care about what form currency takes, so long as they&#39;re getting their share of the power.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve asked before, that if there was a major collapse of the banking and finance system, how could one ensure they&#39;ll have reasonable access to their digital wallets when they need it?  How can you be sure the exchanges will function as intended? </p>

<p>I can&#39;t help but think cryptocurrecies are just a test-run on a government controlled digitial currency. And how do you get the people most likley to distrust that system on board? Make them early-adopters</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You expressed it better than I can. If cryptos really are outside the paper money system, and give the users control over their money, why wouldn&#39;t governments and the banks want to control them or shut them down?</p>

<p>Conversely, if the banks and governments leave them alone, what does that really say about cryptos? Are they as fantastic and valuable as they have been portayed?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Please go and do some research before pontificating about the role and future of crypto assets.</p>

<p>Crypto assets (currencies) are by design censorship-resistant.  No one or government can turn them off.  </p>

<p>That being said, there have been massive efforts to take control of Bitcoin by attempting to get people to agree to a new/modified source code.  This is known as a &quot;fork&quot; in the coin.  The most recent Segwit 2x hard-fork is a glaring example of this.</p>

<p>Crypto-currencies offer a lot of value to populations underserved by financial institutions--sending money overseas, investing, storing assetts.  They do not currently have a strong value proposition for replacing government backed fiat in developed countries.</p>

<p>But they are in infancy and growing and no one knows how this will play out.   However, modification of financial systems in the form of Germany&#39;s move to unbacked fiat after WW1, to print money to pay war debts, ultimately lead to a populist uprising, Hitler, and WW2.  We are primed for a global financial overhaul, hopefully it&#39;s more peaceful.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never said anything about &#39;turning them off&#39;. I said, what if all governments declare them illegal? So you can&#39;t purchase assets or fiat currencies legally with cryptos? Then what? Cryptos only have value when you convert them into actual assets.</p>

<p>The point? People want a free market, and they have a taste of it in the form of bitcoin, they will never stop. Globalists have lost the power now to control the entire world so there will be countries that  can exchange whatever crytos for whatever value ...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Banks more and more control the mainstream crypto narrative, turning it into a store of value rather than a unit of exchange. Just look at BTC, the most prominent sellout coin. Its investors no longer care about decentralized or egalitarian ideals. They mostly seek huge returns to bolster their personal stores of wealth.</p>

<p>The cypherpunk community has largely moved on to other projects, but each of them will have to deal with the profound corrupting influence of huge outsider investment, and how long can an idealist resist their own repressed greed?</p>

<p>I still have hope for crypto to fulfill its ideals, but it is balanced by an equal amount of doubt.</p>

    <div class="md"><h2> You won&#39;t be able to legally convert them into assets or fiat currencies; then what? You&#39;ll lose everything you put into them.</h2>

<p>Thy can shut down the bitcoin ATM&#39;s and exchanges but thats far from the only way to get a bitcoin. My first bitcoin purchase was meeting a guy in a coffee shop from local bitcoins. Stopping that is like trying to stop someone selling dimebags or prostitutes. I can send western union to to a country where it&#39;s legal and buy bitcoins, there is a limit below 1000 dollars or 500 where you don&#39;t even have to show ID to send it. Stopping it now is impossible. What they will crack down on is undeclared taxable income, that will for sure happen.</p>
