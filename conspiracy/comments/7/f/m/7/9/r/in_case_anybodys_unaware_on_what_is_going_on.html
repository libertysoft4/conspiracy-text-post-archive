        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Trvmp is actually trying to take on the establishment. Ignore the non-stop hate rhetoric and look at the actions. Pados are terrified and getting busted left and right EVERY SINGLE DAY. They&#39;re pouring everything they got into stopping/impeaching him because they&#39;re all going to rot in prison. We&#39;re in some kinda fucked up timeline where a bunch of pado psychopaths have formed together and are trying to enslave humanity (and they&#39;re succeeding!) Trvmp has bought some very critical time to help us turn this around. I&#39;m not here for you to try to debate me, this is what is going on. And you can either try to help or they&#39;re going to seal the deal for humanity. They&#39;re trying to merge with technology,  be worshipped as ai gods and dominate the masses.  This is quite literally a battle of good vs. pure evil.  Seriously watch one episode of 1nf0 w4rs (im not trying to shill, he&#39;s in direct contact with the president and everything they say is right time after time after time) and you&#39;ll know which side is fighting for good and which side is fighting for evil. It&#39;s painfully obvious. Don&#39;t be on record siding with the torture sex cult.</p>

<p>This is coming from somebody that never in a million years thought trvmp was going to be the good guy.</p>

<p>7GAS777 nailed it on the head so I&#39;m pasting it for all to see</p>

<p>&quot;We are all classified as retarded by those who think they sit on an earthly throne. However, the truth is too much for them to comprehend, so they fall victim to the same logical fallacies that they use to attack the people.</p>

<p>They can&#39;t, even to save their own lives, figure out what is going on right now. They have dumped billions (trillions?) into perspective management, information containment, and &quot;occupation.&quot; Force, the threat of force, blackmail, bribery, &quot;employment,&quot; distraction, division, subversion of the truth, and other pointless evils are all options in their mind.</p>

<p>But they cant stop, hush, or avoid what is coming.&quot;</p>

<p>TRUTH</p>

<p>When you&#39;re saying the exact same thing as the shills, you might just be fighting for the establishment. Think about it, they&#39;re paying people to say these things and you&#39;re doing it for FREE. </p>

<p>Feel free to save this and we can reconvene when it becomes more apparent.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was originally for Net Neutrality too because why wouldn&#39;t I be? It turns out the 2015 Net Neutrality Act that is being repealed lives up to it&#39;s name about as well as the USA Freedom Act.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the actual FCC fact sheet on the proposal: <a href="https://transition.fcc.gov/Daily_Releases/Daily_Business/2017/db1122/DOC-347927A1.pdf">https://transition.fcc.gov/Daily_Releases/Daily_Business/2017/db1122/DOC-347927A1.pdf</a></p>

<p>TL;DR</p>

<p>Regulatory rollback throwback to 90&#39;s.</p>

<p>FCC claims the 2015 Regulations gave the government &quot;extravagant statutory power over the national economy&quot;.</p>

<p>Regulatory oversight of the ISP industry shifts back to FTC (Federal Trade Commission) as it has been since the invention of the internet.</p>

<p>FCC is enforcing against throttling, censorship, restriction, etc. by invoking consumer protection and anti-trust laws (via FTC).</p>

<p>If ISPs collectively conspire to paywall a content-provider, they are subject to FTC anti-trust penetration.</p>

<p>FCC has reduced its own jurisdiction, because they&#39;re typically geared toward stricter and narrower regulations (censoring profanity on the radio, cable, etc.) as opposed to regulating the entire internet service-provider industry.</p>

<p>FCC repeatedly acknowledges that its new policy is deliberately business-friendly in hopes to expand the economy (internet plays a huge role obviously). Acknowledges that potential abuse of this friendliness will result in stricter policy.</p>

<p>America has some of the shittiest internet in the world because our infrastructure is antiquated and fiber-optic trenching projects keep getting killed. Hopefully this provides the investment needed to fix that. Better infrastructure means faster speeds and cheaper service.</p>

<p>Remember all the Congressmen who wanted to sell out our personal information earlier this year? Allegedly this FCC repeal will block that, because of FTC consumer privacy protection regulations don&#39;t allow it.</p>

<p>Relevant pages/sections: pg 81 sec 141 re: consumer protection/throttling pg 84 sec 142 re: throttling, pg 85 sec 144 re: Sherman Act protections against ISP&#39;s conspiring against ie Netflix due to anti-trust laws pg 178 sec 319 re: privacy/consumer protection </p>

<p>Basically, this gets rid of the FCC&#39;s Brightline Rules which are:</p>

<p>No Blocking</p>

<p>No Throttling</p>

<p>No Paid-Prioritization</p>

<p>and replaces them with normal FTC Regulations including:</p>

<p>No monopolies. </p>

<p>No collusion. </p>

<p>No consumer abuse</p>

<p>No unfair business practice. </p>

<p>This doesn&#39;t really <del>change</del> <em>make anything worse</em> for the consumer, it changes rules and enforcement around but the end result is the same.</p>

<p>It does change things for the ISP&#39;s which is why they&#39;re so against it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is at best FUD. </p>

<p>Why is it benefiting the market or customers to give ISPs the right to throttle, block and prioritize content? </p>

<p>Let&#39;s turn it around. The new laws enables ISPs to block, throttle and prioritize traffic as they please. Prioritizing sounds so nice. But what it actually does is that it can possible drop other traffic. In other words: The packets you are sending to your destination might be blocked because other traffic was prioritized over it. </p>

<p>&quot;Your phone call was not prioritized and dropped. If you want your phone call to not be dropped, please consider be a premium phone subscriber&quot; </p>

network-management justification . . . a baseline prohibition on blocking and throttling merely codifies standard
industry practice.”); id. at 101 (AT&amp;T “would support a set of bright-line rules that require transparent disclosures
of network-management practices and prohibit blocking and throttling of Internet content without justification.”);
Frontier Comments at 1 (Frontier “remains committed to the fundamental principles of Internet freedom—no
blocking, throttling, or unreasonable discrimination based on the content of the communications.”); id. at 5-6
(“Frontier does not block or throttle customer access to content, and Frontier supports transparently sharing
information about its services. . . . Frontier does not have any interest in favoring certain Internet content or in

protections. We don’t block, throttle, or discriminate against lawful content delivered over the Internet, and we are

principles of an open internet into practice in our own business. We do not block, throttle, or otherwise interfere
with the online activity of our customers, and we are transparent with our customers regarding the performance of

<p>508 See Acting Chairman Ohlhausen Comments at 11 (“Notably, many major BIAS providers have now explicitly
promised to adhere to net neutrality principles. These kinds of promises are enforceable by the FTC, assuming it has

<p>While not specifically having rules regarding throttling etc, ISP&#39;s won&#39;t be able to do it in practice without getting fucked up by anti monopoly regulations.

It looks like it&#39;s something ISP&#39;s can use for network traffic engineering, improving latency in the event of heavy usage. It can also be used, and I assume this is why you don&#39;t like it, against file sharing networks like BitTorrent. </p>

<p>I mean, it&#39;s cool to be able to download music and movies, but it is stealing, so preventing companies from having their product stolen is probably good for the free market. I don&#39;t ever torrent anything so I don&#39;t really care, but you can&#39;t have seriously thought the age of pirating was going to go on forever right?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s easy to hide p2p inside for example https, so that is not really the core of the issue. It is also manipulating the topic at hand towards &quot;you want a free internet, so you are stealing things, right?&quot;. </p>

<p>If you take a simple traffic shaping scenario. 
Say you have two traffic classes. One is called &quot;good traffic&quot;, the other is called &quot;bad traffic&quot;. This allows the provider to specify bandwidth inside the total capacity of your connection. Say good-traffic gets 99% of the bandwidth and bad-traffic gets the remaining percent of bandwidth. Now when you have shaped and prioritized traffic, there are many way to do it. You can have the network equipment try to buffer the traffic until good-traffic queue is cleared, or have a round-robin sort of setup, three packets from good-traffic, one packet from bad traffic. </p>

<p>Well so let&#39;s say that only the companies who paid for it ends up in good-traffic. Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Facebook, Netflix, etc. Everyone else have the option or paying up for the fee, or be classified as &quot;bad-traffic&quot; and have 1% of the total capacity. So everyone using this connection will experience the companies who paid for good-traffic to be responsive, quick and just generally great. So unless a site/service pays the &quot;good-traffic&quot; bribe to the provider, their service is going to perform poorly. See where I am going?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>See, that would be considered throttling, and if that happens, Netflix or whoever will know about it and they can either complain to the FTC, and the ISP will be fined treble damages; if they still do it Netflix can cut off traffic to say Comcast, so Comcast customers can&#39;t use it. That will hurt Comcast because their customers will be pissed, and if they also complain to the FTC, that&#39;s when the Sherman Act comes into play. Explained by the FCC fact sheet here:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Pre-Existing Consumer Protection and Competition Laws Protect the
Openness of the Internet</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<ol>
<li>In the unlikely event that ISPs engage in conduct that harms Internet openness, despite
the paucity of evidence of such incidents, we find that utility-style regulation is unnecessary to address
such conduct. Other legal regimes—particularly antitrust law and the FTC’s authority under Section 5 of
the FTC Act to prohibit unfair and deceptive practices—provide protection for consumers. These longestablished
and well-understood antitrust and consumer protection laws are well-suited to addressing any
openness concerns, because they apply to the whole of the Internet ecosystem, including edge providers,
thereby avoiding tilting the playing field against ISPs and causing economic distortions by regulating
only one side of business transactions on the Internet.494</li>
<li>Consumer Protection. The FTC has broad authority to protect consumers from “unfair or
deceptive acts or practices.”495 As the nation’s premier consumer protection agency, the FTC has
exercised its authority, which arises from Section 5 of the FTC Act, to protect consumers in all sectors of
the economy.496 The FTC has used its Section 5 authority to enjoin some of the practices at issue in this
proceeding, such as throttling.497 The FTC is prohibited under the FTC Act from regulating common unilateral change in a material term of a contract can be an unfair practice.505 The FTC’s 2007 Report on
Broadband Industry Practices raises the possibility that an ISP that starts treating traffic from different
edge providers differently without notifying consumers and obtaining their consent may be engaging in a
practice that would be considered unfair under the FTC Act.506</li>
<li>Many of the largest ISPs have committed in this proceeding not to block or throttle legal
content.507 These commitments can be enforced by the FTC under Section 5, protecting consumers
without imposing public-utility regulation on ISPs.508 As discussed below, we believe that case-by-case,
ex post regulation better serves a dynamic industry like the Internet and reduces the risk of overregulation.509
We also reject assertions that the FTC has insufficient authority, because, as Verizon
argues, “[i]f broadband service providers’ conduct falls outside [the FTC’s] grant of jurisdiction—that is, if their actions cannot be described as anticompetitive, unfair, or deceptive—then the conduct should not
be banned in the first place.”510 And the transparency rule that we announce today should allay any
concerns about the ambiguity of ISP commitments,511 by requiring ISPs to disclose if the ISPs block or
throttle legal content. Finally, we expect that any attempt by ISPs to undermine the openness of the
Internet would be resisted by consumers and edge providers.512 We also observe that all states have laws
proscribing deceptive trade practices.513</li>
<li>Antitrust. The antitrust laws, particularly Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act, as well as
Section 5 of the FTC Act, protect competition in all sectors of the economy where the antitrust agencies
have jurisdiction.514 When challenged under the antitrust laws, the types of conduct and practices
prohibited under the Title II Order would be evaluated under the “rule of reason,” which amounts to
either a social benefit-cost test or a consumer welfare test.515 The Communications Act includes an
antitrust savings clause, so the antitrust laws apply with equal vigor to entities regulated by the Commission.516 Should the hypothetical harms that proponents of Title II imagine eventually come to
pass, application of the antitrust laws would address those harms.517</li>
<li>Section 1 of the Sherman Act bars contracts, combinations, or conspiracies in restraint of
trade, making anticompetitive arrangements illegal. If ISPs reached agreements to unfairly block,
throttle, or discriminate against Internet conduct or applications, these agreements would be per se illegal
under the antitrust laws.518 Section 2 of the Sherman Act, which applies if a firm possesses or has a
dangerous probability of achieving monopoly power, prohibits exclusionary conduct, which can include
refusals to deal and exclusive dealing, tying arrangements, and vertical restraints. 519 Section 2 makes it
illegal for a vertically integrated ISP to anticompetitively favor its content or services over unaffiliated
edge providers’ content or services.520 Treble damages are available under both Section 1 and Section
2.521</li>
<li>Most of the examples of net neutrality violations discussed in the Title II Order could
have been investigated as antitrust violations. Madison River Communications blocked access to VoIP to
foreclose competition to its telephony business; an antitrust case would have focused on whether the
company was engaged in anticompetitive foreclosure to preserve any monopoly power it may have had
over telephony. Whether one regards Comcast’s behavior toward BitTorrent as blocking or throttling,522
it could have been pursued either as an antitrust or consumer protection case. The Commission noted that
BitTorrent’s service allowed users to view video that they might otherwise have to purchase through
Comcast’s Video on Demand service523—a claim that would be considered an anticompetitive foreclosure claim under antitrust.524 Comcast also failed to disclose this network management practice and initially
denied that it was engaged in any throttling525—potentially unfair or deceptive acts or practices. If an ISP
that also sells video services degrades the speed or quality of competing “Over the Top” video services
(such as Netflix),526 that conduct could be challenged as anticompetitive foreclosure.</li>
<li>Among the benefits of the antitrust laws over public utility regulation are (1) the rule of
reason allows a balancing of pro-competitive benefits and anti-competitive harms; (2) the case-by-case
nature of antitrust allows for the regulatory humility needed when dealing with the dynamic Internet; (3)
the antitrust laws focus on protecting competition; and (4) the same long-practiced and well-understood
laws apply to all Internet actors.</li>

<p>You see this is why I am a little bit confused by your reply. In one hand you say they get rid of FCC rules, which are no throttling. On the other hand, you say &quot;that would be throttling&quot;. I might read the whole thing you linked to if I have time later. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know... off the top of my head, in the past Netflix has actually throttled their own content in order to make the ISP look bad and make their customers mad at them, they were doing it to get a concession, whether it was improved bandwidth or upgraded infrastructure I can&#39;t remember; basically it was the opposite of what everyone&#39;s worried about with the ISP&#39;s saying pay us or we&#39;ll throttle your shit. With the FTC in charge and anti trust laws in effect neither side could do that, thereby protecting ISP&#39;s from unfair business practices.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You see that is a perfect example of market regulating itself. If netflix keep pulling that stuff, people are going to stop using it. Think of it as a highway. If a company keep delivering stuff late, obviously the customers are going to be using another delivery service. The ISP is the highway. Their contract is with the customer to provide the bandwidth customer is paying for. Nothing more, nothing less. If they are selling 1.000 100 mbps connections in an area, it is their responsibility to ensure that their infrastructure have the capacity to support 1.000 100 mbps connections. If they cannot support it, then they shouldn&#39;t sell the capacity either. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly, and that&#39;s why you don&#39;t have to worry about them throttling your internet currently, or under the FTC.

    <div class="md"><p>This is not true. I repeat again. If it&#39;s only about regulation that does not affect the consumer, there is no need to allow them to shape, block, police traffic in any way. We agree in principle. I just don&#39;t understand why they need to be allowed to do something which you claim they will not do. </p>

<p>It&#39;s like moving in with your girlfriend with the attitude &quot;I want the right to sleep with your friends, but I will of course not do it. So it&#39;s not going to affect our relationship.&quot; It&#39;s the very same logic. No matter how much you point at other things. This is the problem.

<p>They can&#39;t, even to save their own lives, figure out what is going on right now.  They have dumped billions (trillions?) into perspective management, information containment, and &quot;occupation.&quot;  Force, the threat of force, blackmail, bribery, &quot;employment,&quot; distraction, division, subversion of the truth, and other pointless evils are all options in their mind.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol ok. </p>

<p>D.Trump is born of F.Trump, a kkk member and wartime profiteer. The apple hasn’t fallen far from the tree. Obvious profiteering. Actions verging on treason. I can’t wait for the Mueller investigation to come to light. Then we’ll really see the swamp drained. Democrats and republicans alike. Time to clean house boys. </p>

<p>There is a very real conspiracy that theorists always seem to miss and that’s the very physical very real world where things are actually accomplished. Business are built. Resources gathered, sold and traded. Assembled, sold as product. Regulated. Etc. </p>

<p>Want conspiracy?-
I’ve looked everywhere for hidden knowledge and have dove deep into the rabbit hole. Both inside and out. Astral conspiracy to political. We can discuss any and all of it if you’d like but you’re way off track with this one. </p>
