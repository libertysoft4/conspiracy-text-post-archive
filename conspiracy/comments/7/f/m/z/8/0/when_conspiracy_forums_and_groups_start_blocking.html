    <div class="md"><p>First of all, when you say &quot;admins&quot; I presume you are talking about the mods of this subreddit. Sub policy is that we don&#39;t censor content, unless a post contravenes reddit or <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> sidebar rules. This means that we don&#39;t remove flat earth posts, or anything else conspiracy related, without a good reason. </p>

<p>In addition to &quot;official mod comments&quot; (where, like here, the username will be in green) mods of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> also contribute as subreddit members, and we express our own opinions. These comments are purely personal, and do not reflect an &quot;official canon of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>&quot; - because no such thing exists. We do have a wiki of &quot;confirmed conspiracies&quot; admitted by the perpetrators, but many of these are likely to limited hangouts (ie not the whole truth). This sub neither endorses nor rejects any specific conspiracy theory.</p>

<p>Personally speaking, I don&#39;t think mods should be seen to denigrate or attack a conspiracy theory (eg flat earth), because it can be misconstrued. That doesn&#39;t mean that we can&#39;t make observations which we think the promulgators of a theory have not been adequately able to answer (eg how researchers in Antarctic weather stations experience 24hrs of daylight during the Southern Hemisphere summer, and/or why they are unable to see the Pole Star at any time of year.)</p>

<p>The truth is that very fringe conspiracy theories don&#39;t get much love from the majority of users, and flat earth posts invariably get downvoted. The mods can&#39;t control that.</p>

<p>You wouldn&#39;t be able to tell when the poles &quot;stop&quot; or reverse though. We know where this occurs, as you cross the pole, because people have physically gone to the poles before. Anyone can pick up a compass and hop on a boat and put on a warm coat and hike for a long time until they reach the poles themselves. Not easy due to the cold weather, but its been (allegedly) done before.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure why one would click on this one and not the other, it has all the same issues... finite distance of light, and different starscapes at different locations become something of a mystery, both of these could perhaps be reconciled by directional projection but i never see any of this in all the models presented, for a good reason, it would be quite the can of worms hahaha... then you got the tides, why do they like the moon more than the sun? And then shouldn&#39;t we see the wall from pretty much anywhere on earth in this model? i understand that it&#39;s exaggerated but surely if the that&#39;s accurate a good telescope pointed south (anywhere actually) would show a wall of ice?</p>

Hi.
If other male created words hurt your male culturally mind formed mind why not go to North Korea? or any country that doesn&#39;t allow free thought. Humans like you who think they can classify words as troll words or not are hypocrites. The man wars that protected your free speech would go in vain if your kind was in charge. You are too deep in the man story of life... run with your kind of mind and stop humans from thinking unless like your child mind.</p>

Hi.
Typical man words of sarcasm to defect their fears of excepting how their minds were culturally mind formed and locked by the man story of life. Did you ever ask yourself why your mind formed thoughts are right and you defend them but another mind formed mind is wrong. Your wrong mind formed mind thoughts needs deprogramming .</p>

Hi
Which humans a few of your friends that want control of all narrative?
What new humans to earth would agree with your mind formed thoughts? Don&#39;t judge another human&#39;s mind forming unless looking at your&#39;s. Lets see you know what words mean troll... you know which human man words are laughable. You have no idea who you are but sure if you look deep enough will find the males that formed your so called mind of others. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cavendish Experiment is legit. It is not at all how your shitty article described it. Also, he found the density of the Earth, leading to the finding of the Gravitational Constant. Not the weight, like your article posited.

    <div class="md"><p>The ironic thing is that by shitting on flat earthers it actually made me reconsider it. Since I went to a university and grew up with the globe earth model, I of course immediately rejected the flat earth model due to preconceived biases. However, upon reflection I found that I could not verify myself that the Earth is in fact a globe. I have to rely on some theoretical things (a specific gradient of the atmosphere&#39;s index of refraction) or evidence that I haven&#39;t personally witnessed that could easily be faked (space imagery, star trails at  the equator, etc) in order to verify the globe earth model. The abundance of seemingly faked images from NASA only raises more suspicions. How hard is it to simply have a live feed from a geostationary satellite showing the earth in its entirety? To my knowledge, such evidence does not exist.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t necessarily subscribe to the flat earth theory but to dismiss it without doing the math and looking at the evidence is not the way of a truly open minded investigator. Nothing is as it seems.</p>
