        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I have close to 40 acres in the Appalachian Mountains with a small cabin where I got stay at and have personal retreats every fall (Just left from there 2 weeks ago). </p>

<p>Anyway, I&#39;m thinking about building/starting some sort of community there of truth seekers, off the gridders, mystics, mysfits, oddballs, innovators, and so on.</p>

<p>I have a small Tech Start Up I work at as my 9-5, a sort of think tank for marketing, Govs, academia, etc with a handful of co-investors.</p>

<p>Anyhow. Its rather clear that secrets are coming to the surface: Paradise Papers, Panama Papers, Hollywood being filled with Pedos/Rapists, child traffickers getting busted, with social media its so much harder to be hidden, off the grid, etc. All to say that we are entering an age of Transparency, where all secrets are out in the open. So I would definitely like to create a community that is fully transparent.</p>

<p>Decentralized Power. With Solar now cheaper than coal, and Tesla Battery tech, this is the way to go.</p>

<p>All cities, cultures, etc have rules so obviously I&#39;d have to hash this out as well here.</p>

<p>The Tiny House movement is badass because it allows people to own homes which are alot cheaper and smaller, bypassing being a mortgage debt slave where the initial cost of your home ends up 3-5 times more because of interest. There really aren&#39;t any tiny house communities.</p>

<p>Ginseng. I plant ginseng on my property when I have there during the fall planting season. The founding fathers of America, some of them made a fortune off of Ginseng, which grows well where I have acreage, however, takes 5+ years to mature. Regardless, its an honest living and not too hard besides watching out for thieves at night and keeping it fenced from deer.</p>

<p>Vertical farming, food production, chickens, etc. Producing a lot of our own food, organic, glyph0satan free, would be key as well.</p>

<p>Making sure to be decentralized, innovative, producing various things for market/sale/gdp, transparent, balanced, etc, all these things would need to be established.</p>

<p>Also, Meritocracy. I think people coming who have skills to offer is key to a successful community. Electricians/solar, farmers, carpenters, tradesmen, leaders, engineers, etc is vital to a successful culture, as show here:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/kishore-mahbubani/singapore-world-successful-society_b_7934988.html">https://www.huffingtonpost.com/kishore-mahbubani/singapore-world-successful-society_b_7934988.html</a></p>

<p>Singapore is the Most Successful Society because it is a Meritocracy.</p>

<p>Anyhow, feel free to bounce some ideas around. Right now it&#39;s just in think tank, notes on paper mode. I&#39;d have to check into some more legalities and country codes before getting it all started.</p>

<p>Freedom of beliefs, openness, people are free to come and go within a specific set of rules, there is nothing forced on anyone. Cults have rules where you have to be with them or a part of them. This wouldnt be a cult because you are free to leave whenever</p>

<p>No, they are cities. Do cults live there and are free to do their &quot;religion&quot;? Sure! There&#39;s freedom of religion as long as it plays by the rules.</p>

<p>There are Commune Type communities that already exist where there are hippies living with atheists and critical thinkers and so on.</p>

<p>Considering I would like engineers to come and live there to help engineer solar, sewer, industry, tech, like a tech hub or startup would, I dont see at all where you are the &quot;cult&quot; correlation is coming from, since there wouldnt be a central figure to worship</p>

<p>This is a straw man. </p>

<p>And it doesn&#39;t matter you aren&#39;t going to set up a cult. No one has said that in this thread. All we have said is that there is a chance with a small isolated community. Thus it&#39;s worth considering what to do if it does happen surely?</p>

<p>There&#39;s a chance anything can happen. Considering it would be a meritocracy and there was an emphasis of attracted tech savvy, engineers, tradesmen, and educated folks of various skills and backgrounds to make it work, it&#39;d be pretty hard for this thing to turn into a cult</p>

<p>A cult revolves around a leader. At least the old school ones do. That&#39;s easily preventable by a variety of checks and balances. That;s the last thing I&#39;d ever be worried about. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>But also people who are disillusioned with modern life?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m not disillusioned with life because I have money, comfort, and am spiritually and psychologically whole and feel complete, at peace, because of my Qigong practices, meditations, and studies. I&#39;m certain a specific program allowing people to have some more freetime to focus on meditation, critical thinking lessons, letting go, exercise, comforts, etc would bring a higher level of life satisfaction.</p>

<p>Disillusionment of life is due to the rat race wake slave cultural programming</p>

<p>call me border line autistic then, because my being needs nature, woods, isolation at least a few times a year. I actually have synesthesia as well.</p>

<p>I&#39;m really sensitive to my surroundings because of my QiGong and mediations (awakenings, etc) so its really difficult for me to be in cities and a strong collective consciousness. The midwest has a very thick cloud of Rat Race surface level unconscious collective. I need to unplug from this regularly.</p>

<p>Anyway a community like this would provide tiny houses/or other, a bit further out for those who need that space</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i applaud the intention.  </p>

<p>some thoughts.  merit shouldn&#39;t be the operating principle of your system.  why?  because people conflate &quot;good ideas&quot; with &quot;people who sometimes have good ideas&quot;.  they&#39;re quite different.  a better model is to apply the notion of merit to which ideas are manifested into your system design instead of ceding this to &quot;what people think merit looks like&quot;.  and it should be measurable and testable.</p>

<p>secondly, all of the reasons for doing this are completely valid, but isolation isn&#39;t the best way to manifest change.  isolation is just another name for division.  the better way to manifest change is to build networks of exchange of &quot;sustainable goods and services&quot;.  this doesn&#39;t suffer from the geographical separation thing.  and it helps to heal those existing places whose constituents might want to move in this direction but don&#39;t have the means to do it whole hog.</p>

<p>Yup, well aware of that. Proof of concept. That&#39;s the thing, as something like this evolves, its constantly being tinkered with, problem solving, efficiency, study, parameters and statistics, etc</p>

<p>The thing with the U.S. is that its really big and there are HUGE swaths of land in between city centers. In this case, the openness of coming and going, and im not talking about my last GF wink wink, allows of trade, movement, etc.</p>

<p>Like your idea just want to better understand what shape of community you are wanting. Will people be aloud to remain critical of each other, and offer their opinion. Will people be able to explore while respecting the rules set. And push boundaries? Is there a definitive set of rules in which these community would adhere to.

<p>Lol, if you knew me, you&#39;d think the opposite. I try to get away from people as much as I can. I get annoyed from my dog following me around all the time, let alone people.</p>

<p>Fortunately, I appreciate the &quot;community&quot; and too much alone time can cause imbalances. Plus having a GF is always fun times if she&#39;s not too insane.</p>

<p>So wanting my independence, not wanting followers, and being too busy with my own hobbies and projects, makes for one bad cult leader </p>

<p>A farm also lacks community. If you make it a community, you bond with your neighbors who are also like your co-workers. You know that to get the job done at work, all your co-workers and you have to work together and everyone has to do their part for the whole to succeed </p>

<p>tesla battery tech, meshnet networks, city fiber, solar cheaper than coal, crypto currency, cord cutters, r/mgtow, r/frugal, r/offthegrid, you can even argue uber as well, are all systems opting a decentralize efficiency model and have been unstoppable.</p>

<p>Its already too late, CIA lost the war. The movements are here and they are already doing irrevocable damage to all the predecessors who are freaking the fuck out and getting desperate like a cornered rat</p>

<p>There are already communes in the midwest, east, south east, etc. This would would simply try to do it a bit differently and with meritocracy and talent/education based filters.</p>
