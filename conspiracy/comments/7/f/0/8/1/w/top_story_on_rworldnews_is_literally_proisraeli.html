<p>Even the commenters are impressed by the propaganda:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Listen, I hate trump, but your title is unbelievably misleading </p>

<p>Finally a President willing to respect the bounderies of Sovereign Nations. How many Americans would support Israeli military raids deep in American territory?</p>

<p>Good. Fuck Israel and their apartheid</p>

<p>This subreddit has become primarily propaganda against the US president. I will be blocking this sub.</p>

<p>Isn’t this old news? What’s new in this article?</p>

<p>I think that people are a little too okay with commando raids into sovereign nations. There should be outrage at this more than exposing it.</p>

<p>Why TF is Israel SO in every country? It&#39;s about to come to light that Israel attacks itself to occupy and invade then steal Palestine and Syria. And that Israel and America aid Saudi in the Shiite genocide in Yemen. </p>

<p>Good. Israel is in Syria illegally. What were the commandos doing? Probably help launch a chemical attack against civilians to blame on the elected Syrian govt.</p>

<p>1) why is this news again, this was posted months ago?</p>

<p>2) the intelligence was Jordanian not Israeli.</p>

<p>3) where the hell does this crappy rerun mention anything about a commando raid deep in Syria? They literally do not mention it a single time after the title</p>

<p>So, I&#39;m assuming Israel&#39;s PR firms are in full force in this post thread?</p>

<p>Any word of the covert Israeli commando operation on 9/11/01?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(lol!)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>couldn&#39;t find any recent sensational headlines so had to pull one from the beginning of the year. this just in: trump said &quot;grab her by the pussy&quot;!</p>

<p>Most of this website is only pro Israeli when it suits them </p>

<p>You mean Trump exposed Israel helping ISIS in Syria so the Russians could destroy them? Israel had all interests in helping and supporting AlQaeda and ISIS in Syria not fighting them, the only time they attacked Syria was to bomb Syrian regime installation and Hezbollah fighting AlQaeda. </p>

<p>Israelis should not have been in Syria.</p>

<p>Why is the position of the left to support an illegal invasion of a sovereign state? I know I know... the “vetted Syrian rebels” that ran sex slave rings and beheaded infidels would have done a vastly better job of governing Syria. /s</p>

<p>Again... Israelis should not have been in Syria. Israel gave the intel that Saddam had WMDs. He didn’t. Many lives were lost. None of those lives were Israeli. 90% of you are neocon scum claiming you are liberal.</p>

<p>The US Government funds the IS so........</p>

<p>Israel routinely sells American secrets... fuck them</p>

<p>Fuck Israel tho. I’d much rather ally with Russia. </p>

<p>Reportedly...Allegedly...Typical keywords when they&#39;re writing bullshit.</p>

<p>Political discourse is fucked on this site -.-</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(and how)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I love how when Haaretz puts something out that criticizes The State Of Israel people are always commenting “This is a super biased news source” or “This is Islamist Propaganda” but when it vilifies Russia or Trump or victimizes Israel it amounts to thousands of upvotes and thunderous applause.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Welcome to reddit in 2017.</p>

<p>At least many of these folks seem fairly woke, but that trash from Haaretz still is on the front page...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you really going to miss the point? I got yours on that and responded to it. I’m just disappointed. Some people think you’re a plant or whatever, and while I know you have your own biases, I do think you’re genuine( if misled) about seeking truth. It’s just kinda scary when the mods WANT to ban people (maybe even just for kicks). With that other thing going in right now about potential suppression of free speech online in general, it’s insane to watch it happen here. IMO, this sub isn’t anywhere near as bad as the hard right or saferbot circles on censorship and I hope it stays that way. All I want your team to do is keep out spam and malicious sites etc. on the flip side, fuck those who abuse the report functions. </p>

<p>And a 3-day temp ban is hardly enough to warrant the ruffling of feathers.</p>

<p>The mod log should be quite telling with respect to the fact that I <em>very, very rarely</em> issue perm bans, and I&#39;ve only increased temp bans lately because  these manipulative accounts have been becoming more and more brazen.</p>

<p>With the exception of this thread, what else has given you the impression that I&#39;m misled? I&#39;ll admit I was a bit too much on the defensive in ITT, however I&#39;m getting tired of the same techniques (TD 2.0!! etc.) that are being successfully used to deflect and divide and prevent legitimate discourse.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s become more than that. This is not the <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> of 2007 or even 2015.</p>

<p>If anything, I also lean on the side of <em>less</em> removals/banning, but coordinated attacks against the mod team (and us individually) have created a brave new world here at <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Look at the front page every day. I know this is an unpopular opinion in some circles, but I maintain that <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is the last major (+500k subscriber) sub left on reddit that is attempting to stay true to what this place was actually intended for.</p>

<p>This is one of the last organic and interesting places left on the site, and it&#39;s no wonder it&#39;s under such heavy attack.</p>

<p>Also, remember that mods are not infallible...things get stressful and we react.</p>

<p>I appreciate your sentiments here though, and I sometimes need to reflect more when things get heated, and I apologize for that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Haaretz has been well know for years it&#39;s an Israeli left leaning propaganda rag and nearly everything printed in it is to be taken with a grain of salt. I&#39;m not at all surprised it would write an article attempting to smear Trump and even the first sentence uses the word &quot;allegedly&quot;. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Trump <strong>allegedly</strong> disclosed an undercover Israeli mission to penetrate an Islamic State cell developing bombs that could go through airports undetected

</blockquote>

<p>The fact the article is written today and whining about an incident that occurred last March only adds weight to my above opinion. Also, from memory, it turned out after sifting through all the dramatic MSM commentary, the info Trump passed on was minimal and helpful to all countries fighting to destroy ISIS. The only way this could&#39;ve been a problem for Israel is if the mission/penetration was to actually assist ISIS and not break up their plans. I&#39;m inclined to think this is the case.</p>

<p>I just jumped over to the r/worldnews post and scanned the comments and wow, just wow, it&#39;s nothing but an anti trump circle jerk. LOL even one user asked if Trump committed treason. Against who? Israel? Do they realise Trump is the US President and Not the Israeli President? What I find most amazing is how the same people trash T_D sub reddit for their openly biased pro trump content without taking a second to look in the mirror and check their own blatant bias. At least T_D is happily open about it as opposed to the the sub reddit titled &quot;worldnews&quot; that&#39;s supposed to be non partisan. </p>

<p>On another note re the user of this post and to the people who constantly attack him every time he creates a post or comment - seriously, what gives? Why do you always do that and always make sarcastic comments about this sub being &quot;T_D 2.0&quot;? I come here every day and I see an even share of pro and anti trump posts, yet some of you continue to whine about it being &quot;T_D 2.0&quot;. </p>

<p>All you are doing is making yourselves look like tiny minded, nasty, bitchy little people. If you don&#39;t like some posts, just bypass them and go to posts you do like - it&#39;s really that simple. It&#39;s the same with the user who made this post, if you don&#39;t like him, then leave him to do his own thing. </p>

<p>In other words, stop with the targeted attacks, grow the fuck up and stop acting like nasty little school girls. It really is ugly.</p>
