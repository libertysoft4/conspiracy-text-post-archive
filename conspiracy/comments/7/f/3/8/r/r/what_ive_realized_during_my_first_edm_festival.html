        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">2</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2017-11-23 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/rbenjamin2.html">rbenjamin2</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This year I went to my first EDM festival and boy let me tell you, it was an experience that I will never forget. I made some extremely poor decisions under the influence of Molly and Acid of some sort. But I&#39;m not here to talk about all the stupid things I did during the festival. I just want to share my observations, under the influence that is. 
 I&#39;m sure many people have made similar speculations and I&#39;ll even post a thread which is basically spot on. </p>

<p>The first thing I realized as the drugs began to kick in was that, these EDM festivals are feeding SOMETHING. Energy is neither created nor destroyed, but it is transferred. There was a point in the festival (day 2) around evening time when the sun was beginning to set, where all sets took what I can only explain as a simultaneous PAUSE. The only sound playing was loooooow vibrations and melodies, almost like a primer. During this time, I could literally feel and see everyones energy being released, almost like it was swirling up in a big ball. It is really hard to describe, but I felt like energy was being sucked up. Really really odd. During this time, I think I remember cell signal being very very weak. EDM music is like non other because it has the power to control and has even more power when you are on common rave drugs which really weaken your outter persona/ego. It&#39;s like you drop a wall in your mind and embody your conciousness.</p>

<p>Second thing I realized was that, water is everything. Once there is no water, there is no order, there is no peace, there is no control, there is no life. This is pretty obvious, but what I&#39;m saying is I am getting the feeling that there will come a time where water will not be as available as it is today. So don&#39;t take it for granted and plan accordingly. We need to prepare for whats (idk what) to come. Sorry if I sound paranoid but these were just observations. </p>

<p>3rd thing I realized is that we have a done a significant number on this planet. Global warming is veeery real and pollution is at a hall time high. We are destroying this planet! I wish coming up with a solution were easy for all the waste we produce but it&#39;s not easy when so many things we use are not biodegradable. Try your best not to liter. Even one person can make a difference. </p>

<p>4th thing I realized was that there is an agenda going about, more specifically a military agenda. We are preparing for something huge and we (US) plans on eating everything in our path. Many will die. The only way we can avoid this is to love one another. This is very difficult because there are many people who&#39;s lives you may not agree with and THATS OK. You don&#39;t have to feed into the BS where if you don&#39;t accept a persons lifestyle then your sexist or racist or homophobic or ableist etc etc but you do have to remember that WE ARE ALL PEOPLE. </p>

<p>5th thing I realized, and this goes hand in hand with realization 1, was that these festivals are in someway shape or form a form of mass control, or an attempt at least. It is LITERALLY  a test sight. What better place to perform such an operation then at a music festival, more specifically an EDM festival, where thousands upon thousands are drug induced and vulnerable. Like I said earlier, I picked up on a lot of energies and processed a lot of thoughts, and as a result of that I was also very very fucked up, which ended up with me being brought to a med tent. But something about the tent and the doctors in it was just so peculiar. They almost seemed like they were studying me, not trying to figure out how to help me. They sat me down in a chair, and just questioned me. I could pick an extremely threatening energy from them so I was somehwat hostile towards them. Not in the sense that I was throwing fist, but I didn&#39;t give them the answers they wanted nor was I friendly. The acid I assume made we somewhat of an animal LOL. When I realized that this was not the place I wanted to be in, I quickly bolted for an opening in the tent and took off. I swear thats the fastest I&#39;ve EVER ran. I was flying....Only to be tackled and beaten to the ground from the moment I stopped. </p>

<p>All of this sounds crazy, and maybe I&#39;m freaking crazy, but I was reading through this thread ( <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/36xkrd/strange_happenings_regarding_edm_festivals_raves/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/36xkrd/strange_happenings_regarding_edm_festivals_raves/</a> ) and it made me want to share my experiences as well. I&#39;m sure there was plenty of other things that came to my head but that&#39;s all I can really rememeber. Let me know your thoughts. Am I bugging? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I had a very similar experience at a hippie/transformational festival. Every day as the sun went down, an easy number of 2,000 people gathered on this hill and we all howled at the sunset. It’s the festivals tradition, but something always felt eerie, like a lifting of energies from the day.</p>

<p>I also agree with your water statement. Lol. </p>

<p>Festivals are crazy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>When I was at EDM, I actually did shrooms and, drugs do change your perception, they connect different part of your brain and you reach new conclusions. Well this is what I saw:<br/>
1. People&#39;s lives are miserable and they come to EDM so they can be happy. They come to EDM with HUGE expectations, thinking that this will make them happy, there&#39;s music, shows, attractive woman, drugs, everything they could want, but no, it&#39;s not like that. EDM is a huge opportunity for people to come together and so people come to EDM expecting to receive this joy and happiness, and they don&#39;t get it. It&#39;s only when they give and contribute to the EDM festival do they receive that joy and happiness.<br/>
And I saw this everywhere, the ones who did not contribute turned to more drugs, but the ones who contribute, give light shows, try to meet new people, share kandi, they were the ones having the best experience.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like dis. I like dis a lot. That is also something I really could see. A lot of people were unhappy with their lives. Unsure. Depressed. Self Esteem at an all time low. Even me. I&#39;ve been at a terrible place in my life but I kinda put it all on the table that night. And honestly I REALLY REALLY (not claiming that i have some sort of ability or anything) felt like I could communicate with many people with just touch. It was so weird but it felt sooo real. There would be times where I would run by someone and sense that there was something that they were truly truly fighting and I would literally hold them In their place. I would just put my hands on them and try to push some of my energy towards them...I would look them into their eyes and let them know I feel their pain and that I&#39;ve been there...And that they can keep moving forward and being who they are...and tbh I think some people felt it...I vividly remember &#39;talking&#39; to this guy, and I could see it all in his eyes...and he started crying...it was so weird...

    <div class="md"><p>1st off many of your &#39;realizations&#39; are memes. You are thinking in other peoples thoughts. Worst off, they are negative thoughts inducing apprehension or fear.</p>

<p>2nd, is consider that even if these events are harvesting (creating?) some metaphysical energy (and surely they are) it may not be a bad thing. Compare it to a prison for instance which has its own &#39;mood&#39; - basically the opposite of a party.</p>

<p>3rd, look into very old temples and what exactly went on in them. Temples and churches in modern times are a bore, but maybe they weren&#39;t always. An EDM festival is very much a ritual, just as it is going to movies watching <em>stories</em> (which used to be told in temples) about &#39;Gods&#39; (comic book characters).</p>

<p>As for the &#39;control&#39; factor, the control is agreed to. Everyone consented to attend these things. You are controlled by your own thoughts and desires.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meme">Memes</a> or rather corrupted memes (thought patterns). Most of the societal thought patterns or memetic devices come from media, like: gun control, global warming, nuclear threat, terrorist threat, racism, etc are all boxed patterns of thought which people tend to incur mind loops or emotional triggers (depending on the observer/perspective) when exposed to them.</p>

<p>For instance if you see people pulling guns out of their trunk, instead of immediately thinking they are sport shooters, hunters, gun collectors, if exposed and imprinted by the <em>gun control</em> meme (mass shootings, etc) you may be imparted with immediate fear.</p>

<p>After taking mushrooms or MDMA, with the feeling of joy and warmth, it may arise that guns aren&#39;t needed because everyone is in a state of brotherly love but fail to realize it as you are doing at the precise moment - thus, guns are not needed anymore and someone should do something about it. Immediately rescinding the free will of gun owners and any legalities that emotional <em>want</em> would entail.</p>

<p>Someone might have fears and apprehension about nuclear weapons going off. Even if it were an actual risk (some people have them living in no strategically significant areas) it makes little logical sense to allow it to affect one&#39;s life.</p>

<p>It all stems from the memetic devices. Some memes are uncorrupted  (maybe not the ones listed) but they do exist. They should impart some kind of understanding or <em>meaning</em> if they are uncorrupted. For obscure memes its similar to being &#39;in on the joke&#39;.</p>

<p>For instance the original troll of Hillary with Pepe was done when she spoke at an event and someone heckled her. Pepe was then used as a Hillary troll (the original meme associated with her). It became independent of any prior use in this respect. Then her campaign labelled it the &quot;racist cartoon frog&quot; </p>

<p>(naturally in the environment it emerged there were &#39;racist&#39; memes also being produced with it but arguably independent in an anonymous board)</p>

<p>The point is the original use was uncorrupted. Comical and satirical and everyone who observed it was &#39;in on the joke&#39;. The media&#39;s reboxing of the meme created a new corrupted version. Those who now associate Pepe as being racist are not imparted with any <em>understanding</em> of its origination. They simply see its use as being racist and evil, so in effect its imparting the opposite.</p>

<p>The &#39;Pepe/Kek&#39; could and should be studied for years to come in academia as its a perfect example of memetic devices being used in the political sphere, and also how a singular meme with a very clear beginning was weaponized to identify and attack the place it was created. This has nothing to do with the politics behind it, but as a case study its fascinating.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great post man. Thanks for sharing your experience.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been to a bunch shows/festivals where I felt very similar &quot;eerie&quot; (sp?) vibes that you describe</p>

<p>I was at one show where people we&#39;re OD&#39;ing all over the place. Bunch of fights. The whole vibe was awful and I got a feeling that it was by design (no way for me to back that up)</p>

<p>If you look into the Altamont Festival (many ppl credit that show with the downfall of the 60s peace rock movement) I think you&#39;ll see a case of a three letter agency using a music festival for malicious purposes</p>

<p>Some interesting things about Altamont:
1. Hells Angel (military/intelligence ties) were hired to run security. They sold tainted acid, beat people up, beat performers up, even killed a patron
2. The murder of that patron was recorded on by George Lucas. This has been mostly scrubbed from the internet, but I promise you a young George Lucas was the guy who caught the guys murder on camera. That murder was very suspicious and debated.
3. There were a bunch of fires due to arson. Bunch of ODs. bunch of fights
4. The Grateful Dead were supposed to perform. They were warned by one of their spiritual advisors (might not be describing this fully accurately) to not go. They got to the show, felt that the vibe was really off and turned around and left. 
5. The Rolling Stones, who actually weren&#39;t accepted as or part of the peace/free love movement (they weren&#39;t even invited to Woodstock), headlined the show. If you believe in occult stuff: the guy was murdered while they performed &quot;Sympathy for the Devil&quot;</p>

<p>After Altamont there were a few other shows in Europe where there were fires, tainted drugs being sold, gangs running security messing people up. The public began associating what was a peace/love movement with ODs, violence, and motorcycle gangs.</p>

<p>To me this was a clear Psyop. </p>

<p>Fuck The Rolling Stones btw (look up how a 16 year old boy who was having an affair with Keith Richards wife &quot;shot himself&quot; playing Russian roulette in Richards home$
Look up the mysterious death of Bryan Wilson, the only Stones member that was accepted by the rest of the 60s peace rock community.
Think about all the 60s peace musicians that died mysterious deaths in the span of just a few years
Listen to the song American Pie by Don McLean. It&#39;s about Altamont. Listen to Speedway Boogie by Grateul dead, also about Altamont. </p>

<p>Oof got lost in all that.</p>

<p>Point is: ya man festivals have been used for Psyops and/or occult ceremonies in the past. Wouldn&#39;t be surprised if they still are (route 91 perhaps) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was big names too like deadmaus and David guetta. All of their animations during their sets were satanic and all the kids were going nuts for it. Not sure if they were so drugged out they didn’t notice or didn’t care...how can you miss a 50 foot baphomet head?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with many of your observations and generally feel the outdoor EDM/rave scene to be perfect covers for many and varied underhand, criminal, psy. op. trials and occult ceremonies among other more mundane, violent and dangerous goings on.</p>

<p>On the energy harvesting narrative watch this video and tell me what you see about the graphics depicting the stadium the whole opening ceremony and games are to be held in and what the graphics indicate is to occur in there just before the video starts in earnest between the first seconds up until 0:15-16 sec.:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4As0e4de-rI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4As0e4de-rI</a></p>

<p>I see initially a channel of multi coloured (representative of the worlds cultures?) light = spiritual, kinetic, psychic, emotional energy being channelled into a battery like wheel, yes I know the wheel of london ride/attraction, and then refracted thru a lens and poss. sent into the atmosphere? Outer space? To other entities?</p>

<p>The a new graphic appears depicting a simplified version of the purpose built, occult street name encircled london 2012 stadium which again appears as tho it is depicting energy coursing into the stadium and then being fed or projected up into the heavens.</p>

<p>And then there is the infamous, +++creepy, +++spooky opening ceremony that like the swiss tunnel opening leaves a lot of things to be explained and appears to depict a lot of themes that have beyond questionable relevance and reason to be included in a olympic games opening ceremony but hey you know what ever your into olympians...    </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You just blew my fucking mind. I went to go see an edm show in Wisconsin a month ago. I swear it was sponsored by the illuminati and I&#39;ll explain why.</p>

<p>From the moment we got to the venue we we&#39;re hearded in like cattle with metal fences and all. We go through 3 different security checkpoints before we get to another room where there is a list of rules banning everything (gum, led toys, candy bracelets, ecigs, etc...) </p>

<p>So the location picked in Wisconsin is in between Minneapolis Detroit and Chicago.  Basically nobody there was familiar with the area, and now we just got stripped of almost all belongings.  It felt like a power/mind game from the beginning. </p>

<p>Now we&#39;re at the stage and I&#39;m getting the sensation that It was some kind of archon ritual (like VERY STRONGLY) . after not long I notice there is an all seeing eye bouncing around the screen, no other visuals. So I&#39;m dancing with my girlfriend when I notice this really deep frequency beneath the music, it changes, and all of a sudden everybody in the crowd is grinding on each other including my girlfriend and I. We both get freaked out at this point and leave the stage before reconvening. And at the same time we both said and thought, &quot;that was mind control&quot;</p>

<p>My girlfriend told me while we were dancing that she saw everybody in the room was dead and it was just her and some kind of demon before snapping out of it. She legitimately thinks this thing was trying to possess her. And she told me throughout the night a voice in her head kept telling her to hurt people and she says she was soooo close to hurting people. She&#39;s never ever had those thoughts before (what she told me) and it was VERY uncharacteristic. </p>
