        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><strong>An Unkind World</strong></p>

<p>The Christmas music blared as I waited in line at the Dollar Tree, and the cashier was obviously worn out.</p>

<p>As I was checking out, she was verbally assaulted by various customers, all as they were purchasing Christmas items and gifts. I do not have to state the direct irony of this situation, do I?</p>

<p>Recently, I have read some recent articles about how feeding the homeless is becoming illegal in many cities:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/06/10/bans-on-feeding-the-homeless_n_5479450.html">https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/06/10/bans-on-feeding-the-homeless_n_5479450.html</a></p>

<p>Finally, I saw a post on <a href="/r/confession">/r/confession</a> recently. The post was about how the person hated pretending they liked Christmas gifts. I will not link to it, but essentially, they did not like ‘faking’ they liked gifts. I felt sickened.</p>

<p>Somebody could give me a sock with popcorn sewn to it, and as long as their intentions were there – as long as their heart was in the right place, I&#39;d be happy. The argument was that some people do not think of others when buying gifts, but I still would be appreciative if anybody thought of me at all on Christmas. (Btw the confession post was very highly upvoted.)</p>

<p>I remember I participated in Secret Santa last year, and I bought a pretty expensive gift for a co-worker that I thought she would love! She asked for the gift receipt.</p>

<p>What is happening to our world, where people feel so entitled? What is happening to our world where one person can be so unkind to another? Sure, maybe this has always existed, but I’d like to argue that it is more apparent today now than ever. This post will be one of my shorter ones, but I feel it is relevant. The conspiracy is that people only care about themselves, or is it getting that way. The conspiracy is that I even have to write about kindness in the first place. </p>

<p><strong>Empathy</strong></p>

<p>Part of the issue is people are statistically becoming less empathic:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/artificial-maturity/201403/why-empathy-is-declining-among-students-and-what-we-can-do">https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/artificial-maturity/201403/why-empathy-is-declining-among-students-and-what-we-can-do</a></p>

<p>Screen time, information overload, and lack of role models are all cited as reasons for decline of empathy.</p>

<p>While there are likely many factors behind this decline, I blame our screens the most. When a person can experience things through a screen (or a shield), they lose touch with humanity. I mean, maybe that’s why teens can record a man drowning, laughing, and not do anything:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/07/26/us/florida-teens-charges-drowning-man/index.html">http://www.cnn.com/2017/07/26/us/florida-teens-charges-drowning-man/index.html</a></p>

<p><strong>Narcissism and Apathy</strong></p>

<p>The conspiracy here is not that people are becoming more self-absorbed. That is obvious:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/narcissism-the-science-behind-the-rise-of-a-modern-epidemic-a6925606.html">http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/narcissism-the-science-behind-the-rise-of-a-modern-epidemic-a6925606.html</a></p>

<p>To me, the conspiracy is that nobody cares. No matter how many articles are cited about the dangers of social media and narcissism, quite simply, nobody seems to care. Millennials, after all, are cited as the most apathetic generation:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/narcissism-the-science-behind-the-rise-of-a-modern-epidemic-a6925606.html">http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/narcissism-the-science-behind-the-rise-of-a-modern-epidemic-a6925606.html</a></p>

<p>I think when everything becomes about YOU, it is impossible to care about the world around you. If you’re daily life consists of internet likes, I bet you can hardly be bothered with anything else.</p>

<p>What’s scary is that most of the children being born now are essentially being born with technology in their hands. Toddlers are now taking selfies:</p>

<p><a href="http://time.com/3465/the-millennial-kids-are-alright/">http://time.com/3465/the-millennial-kids-are-alright/</a></p>

<p>The point is that Narcissism breeds apathy. When everything is about you, nothing else can matter, and if nothing else matters, why would kindness matter?</p>

<p><strong>Comfort</strong></p>

<p>I always had a theory that ‘they’ keep us just comfortable enough so we do not complain. Maybe that theory is true, after all.</p>

<p>Still, not only are people very comfortable, but they might do anything to maintain that perceived comfort. That may be why there are so many rude customers in line (like I experienced earlier) or :insert scenario here.:</p>

<p>In some ways, I feel people’s comfort has become more important than their kindness to others. I was shocked when I went to a funeral, and a few younger ladies refused to give up their seats for a few elderly ladies. The context was that somebody prominent in my town died, and the Catholic church service would be several hours. The elderly ladies clearly would suffer standing so long, so they eventually had to sit on the floor. The younger ladies did not acknowledge them – did not even ask if they were okay.</p>

<p>This goes back to narcissism and entitlement. If “I” am important, than nobody else is. Plus, who wants to sacrifice their comfort for somebody else?</p>

<p>From this article (<a href="https://www.google.com/search?source=hp&amp;amp;ei=K5gbWrG4G4LTjwS58JjoCw&amp;amp;q=why+are+people+more+entitled&amp;amp;oq=why+are+people+more+entitled&amp;amp;gs_l=psy-ab.3...227.3364.0.3535.29.14.0.4.4.0.180.1069.1j7.8.0....0...1c.1.64.psy-ab..17.7.587.0..0j0i131k1.0.cFy9yvjY5T8,">https://www.google.com/search?source=hp&amp;amp;ei=K5gbWrG4G4LTjwS58JjoCw&amp;amp;q=why+are+people+more+entitled&amp;amp;oq=why+are+people+more+entitled&amp;amp;gs_l=psy-ab.3...227.3364.0.3535.29.14.0.4.4.0.180.1069.1j7.8.0....0...1c.1.64.psy-ab..17.7.587.0..0j0i131k1.0.cFy9yvjY5T8,</a>)</p>

<p>“The rise of individualism (with its focus on the self and inner feelings) and decline in social norms that accompanied the modernisation of society also meant that the community and the family were no longer able to provide the same support for individuals as they once did.”</p>

<p>Has the loss of community contributed to this rise in narcissism? People can be comfortable behind their screens, hating people, hating the world, but waiting for that one more like.</p>

<p><strong>Misanthropy</strong></p>

<p>It has become ‘cool’  to hate other people. I am not kidding when I cannot tell you the number of people who said they ‘literally’ (not figuratively) hate others. Or, who knows, maybe they were exaggerating, but there is something really off when everybody hates everybody else.</p>

<p>One thing that creeps me out is how people hate babies. Here is a google search on that if you are interested:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.google.com/search?biw=1366&amp;amp;bih=651&amp;amp;ei=7ZkbWrmWFIPMjwS504D4Dw&amp;amp;q=hatred+of+babies&amp;amp;oq=hatred+of+babies&amp;amp;gs_l=psy-ab.3..0j0i22i30k1l3.49684.51798.0.51877.17.10.0.0.0.0.176.919.0j6.7.0....0...1c.1.64.psy-ab..10.6.918.0..0i131k1j0i67k1.82.LelNHsu-CRI">https://www.google.com/search?biw=1366&amp;amp;bih=651&amp;amp;ei=7ZkbWrmWFIPMjwS504D4Dw&amp;amp;q=hatred+of+babies&amp;amp;oq=hatred+of+babies&amp;amp;gs_l=psy-ab.3..0j0i22i30k1l3.49684.51798.0.51877.17.10.0.0.0.0.176.919.0j6.7.0....0...1c.1.64.psy-ab..10.6.918.0..0i131k1j0i67k1.82.LelNHsu-CRI</a></p>

<p>Look, I’m not saying anybody has to love babies or even have them, but I find it strange that so many people have such a distaste for them.</p>

<p>I’m not saying babies are always fun to be around, but when you have a hatred for something so innocent, it makes me question humanity.</p>

<p>Plus, I think the deeper conspiracy here is just that ‘they’ are trying to break down families and communities in general. When it becomes ‘cool’ to hate others, even babies, nobody is going to want to have social interaction – nobody is going to put effort into building a community. In general, it is no surprise that there has been a breakdown of community and family life:</p>

<p><a href="https://aifs.gov.au/sites/default/files/jh(2).pdf">https://aifs.gov.au/sites/default/files/jh(2).pdf</a></p>

<p>Yet, here we are, celebrating Christmas, pretending we like each other.</p>

<p><strong>Fake Interactions/Duplicity</strong></p>

<p>Most are living double lives. The person we are at work or with friends is not the person we are at home. Sure, there is some use to this, and we all have to do this to survive, but I find it surprising just how ‘fake’ people really are. </p>

<p>Social Media is turning us into a ‘fake generation.’:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.elitedaily.com/life/social-media-making-us-faker/1101264">https://www.elitedaily.com/life/social-media-making-us-faker/1101264</a></p>

<p>From the article above,</p>

<p>“The more you involve yourself with social media, the more you might grasp the fact that you have less tolerance for people.
That’s when it hits you: The people we hate continue to live on our feeds, and the sad part is, we let them.”</p>

<p>It is no surprise that people are faking their lives on social media, but what I find even more shocking is that people will continue to fake liking people on social media.</p>

<p>To me, this breeds some type of insanity. In real life, we would (mostly) not purposely surround ourselves with people we do not like.</p>

<p>However, on social media, we keep them there, and I am sure there are many psychological reasons behind this.</p>

<p>When I went to my abusive family’s Thanksgiving dinner the last week, the topic came up. I told them I delete people on social media who never talk to me. They were appalled. </p>

<p>They asked me why I cared, and I said I did not find the need to associate with people who were not directly involved in my life. 
They told me I was taking social media too seriously, and I remained quiet.</p>

<p>Immediately following, they started mocking some people they were friends with on Facebook, and discussing how embarrassing their lives were.</p>

<p>Yet, on Facebook, they pretend to like these people. If only they could hear what they say.</p>

<p>The point is that this ‘fakeness’ breeds unkindness in the real world. If all day, people are brewing in secret hatred of others on their social media feeds, well, how do you think that plays out in the real world?</p>

<p><strong>Ungratefulness</strong></p>

<p>Going back to the confession earlier, where somebody talked about hating to pretend to like gifts, I think this goes back to general ungratefulness.</p>

<p>Narcissism, apathy, and comfort all probably breed ungratefulness to some extent, but it is not surprising that materialism and consumerism breed ungratefulness, as well:</p>

<p>“But perhaps the most popular form of seeking happiness is through the accumulation of “things.” Materialism, though, is bought at a cost. A society that feels entitled to what it receives does not adequately express gratitude. Seen through the lens of buying and selling, relationships as well as things are viewed as disposable, and gratitude cannot survive this materialistic onslaught. The lack of gratitude is contagious, and is passed from one generation to the next.”</p>

<p><a href="https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/what_stops_gratitude">https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/what_stops_gratitude</a></p>

<p>From this same article though,</p>

<p>“Conversely, the act of gratitude is also viral and has been found to greatly and positively influence not just relationships, but one’s own emotional status.</p>

<p>Research has proven that gratitude is essential for happiness, but modern times have regressed gratitude into a mere feeling instead of retaining its historic value, a virtue that leads to action. Just as great philosophers such as Cicero and Seneca conclude in their writings, gratitude is an action of returning a favor and is not just a sentiment. By the same token, ingratitude is the failure to both acknowledge receiving a favor and refusing to return or repay the favor. Just as gratitude is the queen of the virtues, ingratitude is the king of the vices.”</p>

<p>Finally,</p>

<p>“Entitlement is at the core of narcissism. This attitude says, “Life owes me something” or “People owe me something” or “I deserve this.” In all its manifestations, a preoccupation with the self can cause us to forget our benefits and our benefactors or to feel that we are owed things from others and therefore have no reason to feel thankful. Entitlement and self-absorption are massive impediments to gratitude. You will certainly not feel grateful when you do receive what you think you have coming, because after all, you have it coming. Counting blessings will be ineffective because grievances will always outnumber gifts.”
Everything I mentioned in this post is interlinked. When I stopped believing anybody owed me anything, I actually became happier. </p>

<p><strong>Giving Back</strong></p>

<p>When is the last time you did something good WITHOUT telling somebody or posting it on social media?</p>

<p>Whenever I bring this point up, people get really upset. I am not saying that we should be walked on over or give just to give. I am saying that we should give back when we can, and sometimes it is okay to sacrifice something.</p>

<p>Instead of linking to a specific article, I’m just going to post the entire google search here. Helping others makes us happy:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.google.com/search?source=hp&amp;amp;ei=850bWsHuPIzojwSuvK-ABA&amp;amp;q=helping+others+makes+us+happy&amp;amp;oq=helping+others+makes+us+happy&amp;amp;gs_l=psy-ab.3..0.217.6488.0.6605.60.33.7.3.3.0.428.5360.0j18j5j3j1.27.0....0...1c.1.64.psy-ab..31.29.4048.0..0i131k1j0i13k1j0i22i10i30k1j0i8i13i30k1j0i10k1j0i22i30k1.0.x0BbL-hib00">https://www.google.com/search?source=hp&amp;amp;ei=850bWsHuPIzojwSuvK-ABA&amp;amp;q=helping+others+makes+us+happy&amp;amp;oq=helping+others+makes+us+happy&amp;amp;gs_l=psy-ab.3..0.217.6488.0.6605.60.33.7.3.3.0.428.5360.0j18j5j3j1.27.0....0...1c.1.64.psy-ab..31.29.4048.0..0i131k1j0i13k1j0i22i10i30k1j0i8i13i30k1j0i10k1j0i22i30k1.0.x0BbL-hib00</a></p>

<p>As Christmas approaches, I’m honestly disgusted. Sure, you hear the jokes about how Christmas is a joke itself, but people still participate in it. They pretend to like each other, and they secretly hate the gifts they receive on this holiday.</p>

<p>To be honest, I’m fed up with how others treat others. I am writing this more as a vent than anything else.</p>

<p>This is probably an overdone quote, but it is so true:</p>

<p>“Be kind whenever possible. It is always possible.” – The Dalia Lama</p>

<p>So what’s the conspiracy? I mean, it’s likely no secret that people treat each other like crap these days, but I think the conspiracy is that is what ‘they’ want.</p>

<p>As we become more narcissistic, we essentially lose our humanity. What makes us different from robots, after all?
We have a heart, a conscious, but maybe that is being wiped clean. Maybe it is going away.</p>

<p>Aristotle said, “Love is composed of a single soul inhabiting two bodies.”</p>

<p>If we do not care for anybody but ourselves, we cannot love anybody else. And if we have no capacity to love others, are we really human?</p>

<p>Maybe this is not the most complex post I have written, but I do not think it is has to be. Again, the conspiracy is I even have to write this in the first place.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Aww thanks! It&#39;s one of my simpler ones but I had to write it.</p>

<p>When the cashier was being assaulted, I told her, &quot;Do not worry. I have worked as a waitress in this town. I feel for you and understand. Merry Christmas!&quot;</p>

<p>Her eyes brightened and she said Merry Christmas back.</p>

<p>I wanted to stand up to the assaulters, But I would have definitely been beat up. They were twice my size and I do not live in a very safe area.</p>

Despite the fact that a bully&#39;s typically denigrating activities are aimed at the bully&#39;s targets, the true source of such negativity is ultimately almost always found in the bully&#39;s own sense of personal insecurity and/or vulnerability.[</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Such aggressive projections of displaced negative emotions can occur anywhere from the micro-level of interpersonal relationships, all the way up through to the macro-level of international politics, or even international armed conflict</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There&#39;s a saying &quot;point the finger and you&#39;ve got three pointing <em>back at you</em>&quot;</p>

<p>IF you could teach the kids that &quot;whatever nasty things &#39;the bully&#39; is saying&quot; about <em>someone else</em> <strong>is only becoz that&#39;s how the bully feels about themselves</strong></p>

<p>Imagine how quickly a class of 10yo could grasp this concept?!</p>

<p>Then, IF someone starts saying &quot;hey stop pointing the finger at me&quot; all the other kids hear it and join in &quot;STOP PROJECTING <em>YOUR</em> SHIT&quot;</p>

<p>Like Dr Seuss says &quot;Those that mind, don&#39;t matter, and those that matter, don&#39;t mind&quot;</p>

<p>all the best with the lad</p>

<p>Saw a tedtalk with an amazon forest shaman talking about how everything is connected and they believe global warming is cuz people are too greedy and not kind to one another, they just want more and more, whole world&#39;s like a living organism cut too many trees it fucks with the weather and PTB actively fuck with people to create shit emotions and morals so we fuck everything else up cuz everything&#39;s connected. It&#39;s an endless cycle of fucked up shit fucking up more shit with shit constantly being poured into the equation to make sure everything stays shitty. Sorry for cussing so much. </p>

<p>PTB like promoting the Idea that hell&#39;s below us, really like hell on Earth and use rituals, symbols even language to control things cuz they know how everything&#39;s connected and how to make above (Earth) like below (hell) </p>

<p>Unfortunately Aristotle got it wrong and was probably a narcissist himself. His writing influenced Western thought for centuries nurturing and perpetuating an <strong>egocentric world view</strong> on the population. It is a legacy we still have to deal with. The Eastern philosophers got it right by thinking in terms of symbiotic relationships within the balance of the complementary forces of yin and yang. The ego is the devil within us and needs to be tamed or it will rule us with iron fist. The ego thinks it can do everything but does not realize the self is incomplete without others leaving behind a void that needs to be filled. Nature abhors a vacuum and thus the ego will seek to fill this void with materialist things instead complementary relationships that are mutually beneficial to the self. No matter how much materialism the ego amasses the void will never be filled. A &quot;thing&quot; is never a substitute for a personal relationship or becoming a beloved member of a community.</p>

<p>The studies say otherwise.</p>

<p>Well the studies are wrong unfortunately. If the solution was as simple as removing technological influence from our lives than curing narcissism would be an easy fix. The truth is that those who do not learn the lessons of the flowers and the bees or learn to tame their egos will be at the mercy of the devil within. Here is an example of one of the most narcissistic men I have ever seen. Meet William Crum a man who ran over a motorcyclist not because of road rage but just because it pleased him: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfWI4AATpjI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfWI4AATpjI</a>  (he has no internet, no cell phone, and no computer) so what is his problem them?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Loosing a job wasn&#39;t really an option back then either. I just refused be a victim and I didn&#39;t get fired for putting a rude customer in their place. Some people WANT to be a victim so bad so they can say in other words: &quot;woe is me, look at all my problems. Please have pity party for me. I am so oppressed.&quot; That too is narcissism and is a major problem with our dysfunctional society. Why is everyone in a race to claim some form of oppression and victimhood? Can&#39;t blame that on technology. People need to get over themselves and realize that they are not all that. I grew up in a time when bullying was seen as healthy and part of growing up. I learned to stand up to assholes and never be a victim. If people can&#39;t handle a few bullies on the school yard then how are they going make it in real life. How will people be able deal with a boss that is a jerk, or rude customers, or scam artists, or criminals, or corrupt governments? The answer is they can&#39;t handle it will be trampled into the mud because they are trained victims.</p>

<p>That is the real conspiracy. The powers that be want the masses to play the role of victim and they have trained us well.</p>

<p>I am with you on this and all of spirituality is build on the same &quot;all is one&quot; principle.</p>

<p>Well the studies are wrong unfortunately.</p>

<p>Here i do not agree with you. I think we are living in an electricmagenetic universe that exist out of energy frequencies and vibrations. There are enteties here on earth from a higher dimension who are using technology to influence humans. Once you become aware of this you can see  all connections between the spiritual and material world and all conspiracies to keep them apart. Behind the veils some are using everything they can think of to keep us from finding the truth while keeping us constantly distracted and in a low as possible &quot;vibe&quot; as they can get you, or as low you let yourself get should i say.</p>

<p>There are only two powers at play in this &quot;reality&quot;, fear and Love.
Honesty will show you the way through this maze we are in, Love will shine a light so you don&#39;t need to stumble too much and the &quot;evil&quot; in this world is doing everything to distact you from your quest for your truth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It’s not as easy as that, I used to think it was. When you’re working all day and the time you have with your child is short, you find yourself not wanting to tell them off because you haven’t seen them all day. On top of that most parents were able to threaten their kids with a good hiding if they misbehaved, now we’re supposed to ignore bad behavior and reward good behavior. It’s an art form that is more exhausting than you’d think...... but now I’m just complaining..... good post btw, I like this community </p>

    <div class="md"><p>One theme I&#39;ve noticed in your posts, and this one is no exception, is a dark vision of today&#39;s society and the &quot;next generation.&quot; I&#39;d caution you not to fall into the trap our elders fell into in assuming the next generation is beyond help/ruined. In their case, they attributed it to &quot;the evil rock n roll.&quot; In your post, you attribute it to technology. 
There&#39;s a certain amount of self-absorption that comes with youth and it is developmentally appropriate. This is true for every generation and the current one is no different. One of the articles I&#39;ve linked below noted that the youth of the 70s were called &quot;the ME generation&quot; by their elders. 
I think the youth of today have access to more and better information than my generation ever had. They&#39;re the most &quot;woken&quot; and connected generation to date. Knowing many amazing and impressive youth of today, I have great hope and belief that many will grow to be effective leaders in a shared quest to better the world.<br/>
Below noted from a quick search:</p>

<p>&quot;When it comes to empathy as a desire and willingness “to help those in need,” the Millenial (born 1982-200?) score higher (per the UCLA survey) than any earlier group of college freshmen measured.  They’re also volunteering more.&quot;
<a href="http://blog.saeculumresearch.com/2010/06/millennials-lack-empathy/">http://blog.saeculumresearch.com/2010/06/millennials-lack-empathy/</a></p>

<p>&quot;Other studies have directly contradicted the idea that Millennials are the most narcissistic of previous generations. In a large survey of high-school seniors across several decades, psychologist M. Brent Donnellan (now at Texas A&amp;M University) found little change when looking at the Millennial generation’s ideas about self-esteem, individualism, or life satisfaction compared to young people in the past.&quot;
<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/11/the-persistent-myth-of-the-narcissistic-millennial/382565/">https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/11/the-persistent-myth-of-the-narcissistic-millennial/382565/</a></p>

<p>&quot;Empathy was a theme sounded repeatedly by some of the millennials photographed for this article, and interviewed in an online slide show that accompanies it.
One said he hoped to succeed because &#39;the better you’re doing, the more you can share with other people.&#39;&quot;

    <div class="md"><p>I couldn&#39;t agree with you more OP</p>

<p>I think that Political Correctness was the beginning of the end of people speaking the Truth</p>

<p>Nowadays people are scared of &#39;saying/doing the wrong thing&#39; they ... don&#39;t. They don&#39;t even talk freely for <em>fear</em> of being judged</p>

<p>People need to stop &quot;believing the bullshit&quot; and stop continuing the cycle</p>

<p>Also, &quot;kids <em>having</em> kids. 16yo&#39;s having a baby becoz <em>they want</em> someone to love! How fucking selfish can you get? Not to mention the hoards of single mothers who did the same, just a a later age.</p>

<p>What &#39;life skills&#39; do these people have to teach their children? Zero. Then they build up their kids expectations by telling them &quot;they <em>can do anything they want</em>&quot; ,, which is Bullshit! </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ev7GXzFTPg">This guy Simon Sinek</a> sums it up brilliantly, saying &quot;the millenials are The Most conned/tricked/decieved group of people on the planet&quot;</p>

<p>And any animal can have breed, that&#39;s NBD yet &quot;pregnancy&quot; and being a mother is seen as some kind of remarkable adventure extraordinary people do and that&#39;s just not  true! It&#39;s <em>part and parcel</em> of being an animal</p>

<p>and animals are selfish</p>

<p>sorry, I&#39;m having a shitty week, but watch the video, SS makes huge sense</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The times are so sad. Remember when the family gathered for dinner or to watch tv, now everyone is glued to their own screen, in the same house but not together.  This is so fitting to the time we live in. </p>

<p>2 Timothy 3</p>

<p>The Last Days
 Know this: In the last days perilous times will come.  Men will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boastful, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, without natural affection, trucebreakers, slanderers, unrestrained, fierce, despisers of those who are good,  traitors, reckless, conceited, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God,  having a form of godliness, but denying its power. Turn away from such people.</p>
