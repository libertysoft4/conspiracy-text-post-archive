<p>&quot;The version of Sleeping Beauty with its chaste, true-love kiss that most of us remember from Disney or the Brothers Grimm derives from a 17th-century Italian tale called Sun, Moon, and Talia by Giambattista Basile, based on folk legends dating from the 14th century. In these early versions, the sleeping princess is raped and impregnated by a passing king – but it all ends well because after she wakes and recovers from the initial shock of finding she has twins, he returns and marries her. This constitutes a happy ending.&quot;</p>

<p>You have no reason to believe that the present that you experience is better than the past that you haven&#39;t experienced.  You are using your own experience to commenting on something you didn&#39;t experience?  Come on now!</p>

<p>A time that you didn&#39;t experience could be much better than the present, and you wouldn&#39;t know it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Strictly speaking that is right, but we can tell from archaeology that health, for example, and living conditions are generally far better now than in the past. Just taking the example of giving birth, we can see that women and their child had a high risk of death. That has dropped massively. The list of such is quite long. So, no, we can&#39;t be sure that life now is better, but we can make an educated guess using historical and archaeological records.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You don&#39;t know any of that.  I&#39;d say there&#39;s a 100% chance that 99% of what you know about history is BS.</p>

<p>For instance, most people don&#39;t realize that the Greek gods were actually politicians.  For instance, Zeus the god of lightning is probably more clearly translated as the politician that brought electricity.</p>

<p>Egyptians did brain surgery.  People somehow just assume they did it without anesthesia, but that&#39;s stupid.</p>

<p>It&#39;s far more likely that the opposite of what you believe is true.  That is, we may only be two hundred years past the last major cataclysm, and while it&#39;s the best point in the past two hundred years, things were likely much better before then.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The idea that history is a straight arrow of progress pointing up is very comforting, and I think that&#39;s why it persist.</p>

<p>Many years ago, I was dating a grad student that was taking a history class, and she was called out by the professor for stating that the present is better than the past.  She explained it to me, and it sort of opened up my mind.</p>

<p>But, even in recent history, in the 1980&#39;s M.S. in the US was a treated and curable disease.  Autism rates were lower.  Cancer was rare and unheard of a hundred-fifty years ago.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Every fairy tale is based on some hard knock life stories. It&#39;s not a conspiracy. The hard-knock stories continue to this day they just get labelled differently. </p>

<p>To judge the past in a modern frame also doesn&#39;t make sense. Today some woman gets mad by the mere affection of a man, cries indecency or harassment, yet lives a single life of neurotic anxiety, bitter and depressed. A woman gets taken by a man 300 years ago but he provides for her for a lifetime. It&#39;s relative to the environment.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you think rape for a woman in Saudi Arabia is morally relative to, say, groping her in the West? I mean, under some forms of Sharia the rapist must marry and provide for the victim. </p>

<p>And out of interest, do many women &quot;cry indecency&quot; when you are &quot;affectionate&quot; to them? How do you show your affection? Sounds like you&#39;re doing it wrong.</p>
