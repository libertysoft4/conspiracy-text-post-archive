        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>FYI THIS IS A CONSPIRACY RELATED POST BECAUSE FRANKLY, FEW PEOPLE ARE AWARE OF WHAT CULTURAL MARXISM IS. </p>

<p>I can&#39;t help but feel our country&#39;s lack of unity is due to far left (and I mean FAR LEFT, not your uncle Steve who&#39;s a democrat because he&#39;s union) implementation of  identity politics capitalizing on the tiny things that make us different and making mountains out of molehills with them. </p>

<p>With the mass release of info regarding Elsagate, pedophiles/sexual predators in power, rampant gender dysphoria, the free access to unlimited pornography, bought and paid for politicians from both parties, mass human trafficking, mainstream drug/alcohol abuse, where did it all come from?</p>

<p>Cultural Marxism was put in place by communist social scientists (Gramsci, Lukacs, Frankfurt school, etc) in American universities from 1950 on, to tear away the very foundation that this beautiful country was founded on and I fear that many of the crazy shit happening right now is a direct product of CM. </p>

<p>Main objectives:
1. Destroy the country&#39;s faith in Christianity
2. Destroy the family unit
3. Introduction of critical theory (basically stripping away any sense of &quot;truth&quot;)everything is subjective and even if something has worked for a very long time you should seek to endlessly criticize it. </p>

<p>We send 18 year olds off to indoctrination facilities (universities) and they come out less talented/productive than when they went in. Entering with a somewhat thirst for knowledge and leaving with a hatred/lack of understanding of their own culture and a useless gender studies degree quite often accompanied by a $40,000.00 plus bill. </p>

<p>For 4-8 years they are told that White equals evil and anything that is the minority is automatically oppressed. We are taught to laugh at and criticize Christianity while simultaneously taught to accept Islam.  </p>

<p>It is without a doubt this country was founded on the fundamental values supplied by the Christian faith, obviously we have freedom of religion but to argue this country was not founded by Christians is crazy talk. </p>

<p>Less than 250 years later here we are funding the mass immigration of Muslims (the likes of which were also flooded into Europe, and are now on the verge of causing civil wars in France, Germany, and destroying countries such as Sweden.)</p>

<p>In 2016 the state of Minnesota spent $103,000,000 of TAXPAYER money flooding thousands of Muslim Somalians into small towns in Minnesota (if that&#39;s not a conspiracy I don&#39;t know what is. </p>

<p>Anybody with a brain can tell you that a midwestern citizen of America is not going to jive with somebody who beats his wife, rapes children, and walks all over the American flag. </p>

<p>Obviously not every Somalian Muslim has evil intentions but when they come from a country that has an average IQ of 68 (when we consider less than 70 mentally handicapped here in the states) and they follow a teaching such as the Muslim faith, they can easily be coerced into doing evil while believing they are just. </p>

<p>The United States is a shining beacon of freedom in the world and there is no country that even comes close to guaranteeing the individual freedom of every law abiding man or woman. </p>

<p>So why is social media so anti American? Could it be the very social media outlets you use are not only owned by far left globalist supporters, but they use it as a tool to indoctrinate the youth even further? </p>

<p>When did it become wrong to LOVE this country with every bone in your body? Why are you considered a monster if you believe marriage was created for a man and woman? Why are real men getting harder and harder to find? </p>

<p>What do you think will happen to our country if we keep emasculating men while simultaneously importing 4th generation warfare, jihad spreading, non Muslim stabbing, fighting age males? </p>

<p>When chaos manifests its self in front of you and it will, if you are incapable of producing the correct amount of  violence to not only match but overpower the threat you will be swallowed whole, such is life/nature and has been for millions of years. </p>

<p>No matter what the media will ever tell you, when it comes time to defend this country once again from true evil whether it be foreign or domestic, the ONLY thing that will save us is the sacrifice of freedom loving, family having, God fearing, American men. Just as they have time and time again. </p>

<p>I know I&#39;ll catch some hate for this post because some people are simply too ignorant to recognize how truly wonderful the United States is but I really don&#39;t care.</p>

<p>If you think otherwise I would love to hear so because like I said freedom of speech and ideas is one of this country&#39;s guiding strengths. </p>

<p>Thank you for taking the time to read this and have a wonderful rest of your day. God bless you and these United States of America. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cultural Marxism was The Frankfurt School&#39;s critique of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_industry">The Culture Industry</a>. It was an early critique of mainstream media and neo-liberalism. Adorno had things like this to say:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The Culture Industry not so much adapts to the reactions of its customers as it counterfeits them.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;this bloated pleasure apparatus adds no dignity to man’s lives. The idea of “fully exploiting” available technical resources and the facilities for aesthetic mass consumption is part of the economic system which refuses to exploit resources to abolish hunger.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The ruthless unity in the culture industry is evidence of what will happen in politics. Marked differentiations such as those of A and B films, or of stories in magazines in different price ranges, depend not so much on subject matter as on classifying, organising, and labelling consumers. Something is provided for all so that none may escape&quot; -Theodor W. Adorno, <a href="https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/adorno/1944/culture-industry.htm">Enlightenment as mass-deception</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Meanwhile Marcuse warned everyone that &quot;progressive politics&quot; could also become repressive and regressive in it&#39;s own ways:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=al3aOuqpVbs">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=al3aOuqpVbs</a></p>

<p>...and The Birmingham School warned that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Uses_of_Literacy#The_.22drift.22">culture was drifting away</a> from local culture. Due to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Uses_of_Literacy#Massification_of_culture">Massification of culture in the form of the globalization of media + tabloid journalism.</a></p>

<p>This was a pre-internet critique of mainstream media and neo-liberalism, and ended around the time media became more democratized in the 80s, when the internet began to be foreshadowed with Zines, DIY culture, and public radio/TV. That&#39;s when the tail end of the Birmingham School declared the need to critique mass media <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encoding/decoding_model_of_communication">to be kind of over because everyone could talk to everyone.</a></p>

<p>....of course, the right wing conspiracy theorists will say it&#39;s SJWs and a jewish plot that runs the media... but it was actually critiquing the media.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Globalism is communism&quot;. Not in the least bit, globalism as we know it, is a hyper capitalistic endeavor designed to maximize any nation state or corporation&#39;s given economic sphere of influence in a fast paced  highly competitive and interconnected modern world. It could not be more fundamentally different from what socialism, communism, or marxism actually are. You need to educate yourself becuase everything you have said is just some rediculous parroting of some bullshit propaganda half truth and in no way reflect reality.

    <div class="md"><p>If you want a comprehensive understanding of why &quot;truth&quot; is increasingly relative and fantasies abound in modern America, read Fantasyland by Kurt Andersen. He points out that anti-realism in academia is just one part of wider magical and anti-real/anti-science thinking. It is much more than just critical theory. It relates to media, technology, lifestyles and much more going back to the first colonists. It&#39;s a great read.</p>

<p>You said no understanding of Marx, later thinkers, etc. I believe he is quite capable of peeking into the shallow mind of Marx, or any of his predecessors for that matter, and quite frequently quotes them (and explains what they meant, why they were right or wrong, also incorporating more recent studies and finding to help back up his claim, so I am aware he understands them. </p>

<p>Does he, and do you, have a point on identity politics? Quite possibly, but its one that many Marxists - Ellen Meiksins Wood for one - have made in a far more historically penetrating way. There&#39;s no need to be afraid of breaking the mold, of going beyond ready-made solutions and looking for other, better ways of understanding all this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a reason that cultural marxism is not really a thing outside of conservative ideologues. It is not a conspiracy of silence so much as the theories not holding up against the reading of the original texts. The theory basically lumps together all the pet hates of conservatives and attenpts to explain them through an unlikely coterie of foreign intellectuals. The strongest argument against the evils of cultural marxism is the logic of consumer capitalism and hyper globalisation. None of the trends associated with CM are directly traced to the intellectuals (most can be traced to early twentieth capitalism) and most are good if the goal is to create atomised consumers. Rampant sexualisation, hyperindividualisation, mass immigration, etc, are beneficial to international markets. This doesn&#39;t make it a capitalist conspiracy, it&#39;s just that the combined effects of advertising and media have massively promoted these trends. That&#39;s not to say the Frankfurt School had no effect, but they were part of a much broader trend. The CM theory is quite hysterical in the potency and reach ot gives their ideas (which it often misrepresents).</p>

It neither conveys a proper understanding of Marxism nor the chaotic and organic nature of culture. It is part of a rhetoric that tries to repackage bigotry as virtue, and  societal progress as a degridation, by redefining the western tradition as a conservative one, rather than as a progressive tradition based on the evolution  of human culture, society, and thought.</p>
