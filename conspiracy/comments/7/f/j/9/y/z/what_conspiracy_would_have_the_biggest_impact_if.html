    <div class="md"><p>Agreed it was reported prior to 9/11 and was starting to get more attention leading up to the attacks, which served as quite the distraction from the follow the missing money story, as well as giving tptb a means to tie off some loose ends that were being investigated. So here we are 15+ years later and no closer a transparency test in which we can audit the Pentagon\ our out of control intelligence community.</p>

<p>lol, &quot;It&#39;s not missing trillions now, it is just missing hundreds of billions. All of which can be explaind by the revolving line of credit that DoD has, incompetent bookkeeping and decentralized incompetent financial systems that dont play well together.&quot;  Am I getting the gist of the first article you shared?</p>

<p>That being said, thanks for backing up your post with sources. I will do the same if there is something in my argument that you want more info on.  Just let me know and I will get you some sources when I wake up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You do realise that there is actually no money missing don&#39;t you? It&#39;s only the sum of accounting entries. That year DoD spent $275 billion. So you can&#39;t lose $2,3 trillion 8 times more than there budget from 2001.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. I have an accounting background. I get what they are claiming, that the &quot;missing&quot; money was just transactions that are recorded in decteralized systems. I understand that on a ledger this, or anything really, can look completely different than what it actually is and while I am completely aware of the explanation DoD is giving us here, you should realize it is just that, the DoD&#39;s official response. Per the last paragraph of the article that you just provided.</p>

<p>&quot;Now plainly the US Government saying this doesn&#39;t make it true, and we don&#39;t know what the real or current situation is...They still don&#39;t look too impressive to us -- $700 billion without proper documentation is a lot of money -- but it&#39;s hard to see how any of this constitutes a motive for the 9/11 attacks.&quot; </p>

<p>Using just the information used from this site, yeah it would be hard to see how this is related to the motives of 9/11. I did like that it did not focus soley on Rumsfeld on 9/10 which a lot of people tend to get tunnel vision on. Yet I will try to put together some missing pieces for you to review to help support my claim tomorrow after some zzz&#39;s. </p>

<p>The investgation of the &quot;missing&quot; money which was talked about prior to 9/10, lead some to uncover incriminating money streams that were being used to fund black projects. (Drugs\ Firearms\ human trafficking) Released CIA document have confirmed this, but the investigation of the &quot;missing&quot; money lead some to find out this tactic was still in use. The whileblowers for this were intentionally brought to the Pentagon and building 7 on 9/11.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok how about instead of calling it bs you actually do some research and some basic math. </p>

<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_11_attacks">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_11_attacks</a></p>

<p>In Arlington County, Virginia, 125 Pentagon workers lost their lives when Flight 77 crashed into the western side of the building. Of these, 70 were civilians and 55 were military personnel, many of them who worked for the United States Army or the United States Navy. The Army lost 47 civilian employees, six civilian contractors, and 22 soldiers, while the Navy lost six civilian employees, three civilian contractors, and 33 sailors. Seven Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) civilian employees were also among the dead in the attack, as well as an Office of the Secretary of Defense(OSD) contractor.</p>

<p>From the Pentagon alone, 125 dead of these 75 were Army while 42 of deceased was Navy. So you are about 1/3 correct.... Also nevermind the 7 DIA and 1 OSD deaths because the &quot;majority&quot; of the victims were Navy personal right? </p>

<p>Based on your last response, this is starting to feel like I am wasting my time tring to convince you something that you are not willing to approach with an open mind. So if you want more info I will spoon feed it to you otherwise have a good life and enjoy your koolaid.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If flat earth was true, it would have hardly any impact on people. Yeah people would be confused about why they were lied to about it, but the earth being flat would have no impact on anyone&#39;s day to day lives, nothing would change. It&#39;s not like a revelation that the governments of the world are full of satanist pedos or something, which would cause people to be afraid for their kids, the future of humanity, cause people to revolt and want to tear down government and structure of society and start again. This is why flat earth is such a dumb theory. There&#39;s no reason for anyone to lie about something like that as it has no real effect on anyone&#39;s life what shape the Earth is, no one benefits from a lie about the shape of the earth either.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean Jesus Christ. </p>

<p>Some believe he was killed then rose. </p>

<p>Some believe he didn’t die at all</p>

<p>Some believe him to be god. </p>

<p>Some the son of god. </p>

<p>Others a prophet in a long line of prophets. </p>

<p>But he’s a part of a collective that says they are returning again in the clouds for their elect. And to start all of this over again. </p>
