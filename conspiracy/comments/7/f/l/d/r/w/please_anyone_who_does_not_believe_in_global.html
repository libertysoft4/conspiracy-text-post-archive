    <div class="md"><p>If you don&#39;t believe in human led climate change? 
Obviously, humans are degrading the state of our liveable environment. The worst part is, and I studied in one of the worlds leading Environmental Sustainability programs, with a Degree in Business and Sust, that our global climate has a LAG TIME. The current lag time in co2 emissions is predicted at 100 years. This means that any co2 released into the atmosphere is ultimately soaked into the ocean and stored at deep depths. The ocean currents are slowing, due to rising temps and garbage patches. What this means is that the hot water from the tropics cycles north to, for examples sake, the Greenland Ice Shelf. Due to rapid melting, the water near Greenland has become colder, yet more unstable. The warm water that houses much of our earths co2 sinks, and does not cycle rapidly enough back south to warmer water. The co2 that we are seeing released from the ocean currently is from the early stages of the industrial revolution. AKA about 100 years ago. This does not account for the current co2 emissions of cars, trains, boats, but most detrimental the effects of mass farming. Many people believe that driving/travelling less will help the environment, though eating 2 or more burgers per year is more costly to our environment than driving a vehicle for a year.
The only things that may save us now is synthetically created meat, which is proven to actually be healthier and less resource intensive than natural, grain fed meat. Think about it for a second as a simple feed vs food ratio. To eat 1 lb of prim steak, the cow must eat hundreds, if not thousands of lbs of grain. The water/nutrients required to feed a cow greatly outweighs what a human requires to survive. Therefore, by relying on meat/beef we are using more resources than necessary to gain nearly zero benefit. Rates of obesity and diabetes are at an all time high and it is proven that meat and dairy are the leading cause of this. We spend valuable tax revenue trying to raise money to solve this issue, though the people benefiting from average humans needing healthcare is big pharma. They obviously don&#39;t ever want to solve the problem or they will be out of business/profit.
Our world has been doomed since the invention of credit, to put it simply. If today we stopped emitting all emissions, we will still experience over 100 years of continual warming. This warming is already affecting storm strength and frequencies, and this will not stop for a long time. After studying Climate Change (Global Warming, better thought of as Global Weather Change) I have been severely depressed, we have close to 0 hope. The only people making strides are people like Elon Musk, who know and communicate that humans must leave Earth to survive. When people try to say that global warming isn&#39;t real, think about how we are literally a bacteria that has taken over a small rock floating in a vast emptiness that is known as space.
What is &quot;space&quot;? You need space from you S/O? You need to move your furniture to make more space? Space is emptiness, but space is not empty... I could keep going, if you&#39;re ever interested in talking about the future/past of humanity, please DM me :) If I can give anyone a little tid bit of advice, I would say the best thing you can do is to ; Think Local, Act Local and Live Local. #supportthelocals</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You say &quot;Obviously, humans are degrading...&quot; but environment, and climate are different aren&#39;t they? If my house is messy, that doesn&#39;t mean my neighborhood is. You didn&#39;t provide any pier reviewed science to back up your post, you provided opinions. You should re-read it. 
Your post is literally all over the place, and has no continuity, from cows, to credit, to depression, to questioning what space is. You wont convince many folks this way. 
Science books tell us that major cataclysms created the earth as we see it now. This means, that humans, who make up an insignificant portion of the earth, could truly have no impact, no matter how powerful that we think we are. 
From the National Review:</p>

<p>&quot;A 2008 survey by two German scientists, Dennis Bray and Hans von Storch, found that a significant number of scientists were skeptical of the ability of existing global climate models to accurately predict global temperatures, precipitation, sea-level changes, or extreme weather events even over a decade; they were far more skeptical as the time horizon increased.&quot;</p>

<p>Other mainstream news sources besides the National Review have also been courageous enough to speak out against the global warming propaganda - even the Wall Street Journal published an op-ed piece in 2015 challenging the Anthropogenic Global Warming (AGW) pseudoscience being promulgated by global warming proponents.</p>

<p>And, of course, there are the more than 31,000 American scientists (to date) who have signed a petition challenging the climate change narrative and 9,029 of them hold PhDs in their respective fields. But hey, Al Gore and his cronies have also ignored that inconvenient truth, as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that I did not provide an sources to what I ranted about.  I could cite texts and profs.  The fact is that we are accelerating one of the fastest/largest mass extinctions in known human history.  People who deny this clearly do not care enough to investigate.<br/>
<a href="https://climate.nasa.gov/evidence/">https://climate.nasa.gov/evidence/</a> 
It is widely known, yet clearly demonstrated that science is backed by money. If someone has interests in resource heavy commodities, ie: gas, coal, etc. The scientists they hire will promote their &#39;for gain&#39; system.<br/>
To deny climate change, you are both devaluing the future of the human race, your kids and their kids and so on, as well as basically turning a blind eye to science.<br/>
People still believe in a single God, though history shows that multiple Gods have influenced Earths prior population.  We live in an age of information, and to deny real data and clear cause and effect systems is both ignorant and very irresponsible to the future of our race.
We are supposed to be the most intelligent species on our planet, but we fight each other for a select few to profit off.  If we were as smart as we think we are, we would eliminate war and push science and exploration more... Agree?</p>

<p>Okey, that&#39;s nice, but hello? John? When did you become a scientist? Reporting on the weather and having a degree in journalism does not make you a scientist.

    <div class="md"><p>Enjoy! Very weird story, but I was walking home from the bar years ago and a random man gave me a pack of dvd&#39;s. (sketchy yes.. lol).  It was 4 discs of the Pyramid Coe by Carl Munck, which I have watched multiple times and have a greater understanding of history than I ever aspired to know.  These videos stayed with me and I studied &#39;The History os Science and Technology of Humankind&#39; in university, which was remarkable.  Knowing that our ancestors understood the 26,000 year cycle of the constellations, recording it on tablets that have been found in the middle east and are being destroyed by ISIS and other MSM evils over the last decades.<br/>
It is very eye opening to think that our earth was once inhabited by a more intelligent and peaceful group of people than we are today.<br/>
I&#39;d love to discuss things further after you watch a bit of this theory.  An open mind is the best thing we can own today :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This video does not show anything..... Yes, technology has helped us to increase our GDP&#39;s which is what we base our emerging economy data upon.. I have seen many countries in the world, and quality of life/happiness is how I would rank countries on levels of thriving/surviving.  This video only proves that in the last 200 years we as a race have evolved, clearly we have, which is how we are even debating this right now.   I respect your opinion, but urge you to think larger than what we consider to be a society success.  The world is more connected but more divided than ever, and it is clearly not helping anything at this time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>population doesn&#39;t really have anything to do with the changing temperatures.  Since the industrial revolution, we have steadily increased the amount of harmful gasses in the atmosphere.  These gasses are stored in the deep ocean, and slowly released back to the atmosphere.  Scientists are predicting a detrimental change at 2 degrees warming, (ice melting, water rising, droughts and floods) though we already know that our world will warm up to and if not more than 4 degrees before we see any type of stabilization. 
Yes our population is completely out of control.  We basically need 4-5 earths to sustain the amount of people who currently live, why do you think that global hunger exists? and that diseases do not seem to ever be cured, despite the amount of money and research applied? We need to lower the population and it is happening systematically as we sit here right now.  We have to understand that certain wealthy people have much more influence on the future of the human race than the average person, which is why the happiest you can be is the best way to live our seemingly short lives on this planet.  There is alot of good in this world and you can enjoy life by being a positive influence, I just wish more people were able to come to the realization that our future human race will live in a drastically different world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Global warming&#39;s happening - but not for the reasons TPTB tell you it is.  That&#39;s largely politicized bullshit.</p>

<p>Look into and read up on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuga">Yugas</a>.  We left the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kali_Yuga">Kali Yuga</a> (aka the Iron Age) and are just beginning to enter the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvapara_Yuga">Dvapara Yuga</a> (aka the Bronze Age).  <a href="https://i.imgur.com/Emfpzv5.png">The sun and its sister star Sirius A have passed their aphelion points (furthest apart from one another) and are now beginning the long journey back toward their perihelion points (closest to one another).</a></p>

<p>Granted it&#39;ll take millions of years for them to reach their perihelion points, but the point is that they are beginning to come back closer to one another - and that naturally leads to the increasing of the collective and individual energies and temperatures of each star and the planets associated with each star and caught in its gravitational field.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you believe in the earth model that we&#39;ve been taught, it will always change and there isn&#39;t one fucking thing you can do about it. Every single person can stop buying a single plastic piece of shit, sew their own shoes out of the leaves they find in the yard and hike to work on a daily basis and throw every bit of their income toward a tax. The fucking climate changes. It always has. It always will. No amount of human guilt and tithe will change it. Learn to adapt and refuse to be guilted and taxed about it.</p>

<p>There. I&#39;ve said it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have been listening to the &quot;warmist&quot; side for 40 years and have concluded it is all bunk. They have been screaming about the sky falling since the 70s and 80s. I will give them a reasonable second chance when the own up and acknowledge that every forecast model they have used in the past has been completely wrong. New York City was supposed to be under 20 feet of water by now according to predictions in the 1980s. I believe in accountability in science. If a scientist makes a prediction then they need to own that prediction and acknowledge it was wrong and then adjust their theories. They have NOT done that but have instead clung to their hysterical global warming doomsday theories. They keep trotting out these crack pot theories year after year, decade after decade saying the same thing and every year they never come true. They think we are stupid or something.</p>

<p>The public isn&#39;t buying it anymore have a good day. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>One point I&#39;d like to try to get across is that we <em>know</em> carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas. We <em>know</em> how it works. Its electrons don&#39;t absorb light in the visible spectrum, but it does absorb infrared light. It lets sunlight in, but traps the heat. This is basic, and can be proven by laymen with cheap materials.</p>

<p>It took tens of millions of years for nature to lock those carbon atoms safely underground, allowing us to have the climate <em>all us mammals</em> evolved in, and we&#39;re reversing the process in the blink of an eye.</p>

<p>People are pissing in the pool and saying &quot;its fine, its a big pool, and its not even yellow yet, I mean, its a little yellow, but that could be anything, old leaves could turn it yellow, checkmate.&quot; <em>pisssss</em></p>

<p>And, for a bunch of conspiracy-theory minded folks, the obvious vested interest that the fossil fuel companies hold, and the money they&#39;re willing to throw around to ensure their profits, should be an easy conspiracy to see through, but instead, sooo many people here want to swallow what the industry sells them. &quot;Must protect corporate profits&quot; is not an attitude one would have expected from this sub, but the PR campaign has been largely successful, <em>especially</em> with this sub for some reason.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Climate change is too vague a term. It should be broken down into:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Natural climate change - ie the earth has gone through hot and cold periods for thousands of years.</p></li>
<li><p>Man made climate change - human impact on the earth climate and co2 emissions </p></li>
<li><p>Environmental damage - eg destruction of forests, food chains</p></li>
<li><p>Pollution - eg plastic in our oceans, no clean air</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Each is different, each has an impact on our planet, and not all of them are linked.  It confuses matters when they are all lumped together,  IMHO. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its not that i dont belive in climate change. I also belive we should use more environmentally friendly energies, and modes of transportation. We should all leave a smaller carbon footprint. We do share this world with other forms of life and we need to look out for future generations. It just seems that scientists have an agenda. Take cigarettes for example. For the longest time Marlboro had scientists scrap evidence of the harm cigs caused, but it was science, and actually used in courts as evidence. Look at eggs for another example. They are good for you one year and then bad the next. Look at proof that the American government used their own citizens has test subjects for all kinds of things from radiation poisoning to syphilis outbreaks, and we are supposed to just what they tell us? </p>
