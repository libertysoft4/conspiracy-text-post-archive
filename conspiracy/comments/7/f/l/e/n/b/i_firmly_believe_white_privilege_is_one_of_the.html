    <div class="md"><p>White Privilege is incredibly real, and to dismiss it as a hoax is incredibly harmful- to yourself, to others, to people of color and society as a whole- and one of the privileges of White Privilege.  </p>

<p>White Privilege is defined a &quot;social privileges that benefit people identified as white, beyond what is commonly experienced by non-white people under the same social, political, or economic circumstances&quot;.<br/>
White privilege doesn&#39;t distinguish itself from outright bias or prejudice, but includes less obvious advantages that are often out of sight- similarly to how we take running water and reliable electricity for granted here in the United States, but that doesn&#39;t make us feel anymore privileged for having them.  </p>

<p>Peggy McIntosh wrote an incredible essay that popularized the term, <a href="http://www.nymbp.org/uploads/2/6/6/0/26609299/whiteprivilege.pdf">White Privilege:Unpacking the Invisible Knapsack</a>. In it she discusses the obvious opacity that is inherent in Privilege- we&#39;re taught to not know that we&#39;re privileged, and how it&#39;s based on the &quot;myth of meritocracy&quot;- that our individual merit and moral is based on our individual actions and will.  </p>

<p>Often times, even in this thread, you have people discussing racism issues as issues of wealth- the top comment is &quot;Honestly, I believe it&#39;s a wealth privilege&quot;, which are intertwined, but I believe classism and economic disparities are a symptom of racism, not the other way around- racism is so deeply entwined with every part of our culture, you can&#39;t pull at that thread without untangling the entire fabric of our culture- from politics to economics, to art and education, etc- it&#39;s all tied together and very deeply entrenched in racism.  </p>

<p>Not the overt and obvious racism, mind you, but a very deep underlying racism that we&#39;re not even aware of- hence this discussion.  </p>

<p>I have a problem with the term in and of itself because I believe it doesn&#39;t accurately describe the conditions- in the sense that it doesn&#39;t, in and of itself, express the experiences of white people, as everyone faces some form of oppression and trauma- again, similar to how most of us in the US don&#39;t have to worry about food or shelter compared to others around the world, yet that doesn&#39;t take away from the other daily struggles that we face.   </p>

<p>I believe it actually pushes white people away from coming to understanding with their privilege because it doesn&#39;t encompass their struggle as much as it says &quot;Hey, you, you&#39;re privileged&quot;.  But then again, comfort is a privilege... and not a right, and true changes must come from discomfort.  </p>

<p>You can go back to the Founding Fathers and realize this country was founded on Racism. I know the Declaration of Independence says that &quot;All Men are created Equal&quot; and we&#39;re taught to believe that that means &quot;all human beings are created equal&quot; but unfortunately that&#39;s not the case. Our Founding Fathers, like many other people in the US and Europe at that time, believed that women were property and people of color were not people.<br/>
Thomas Jefferson the author of those very words, like many other Founding Fathers, was a slaveholder. You can&#39;t own slaves and say &quot;All Men are created Equal&quot;.<br/>
So the very ideals of our country were created and held by men who did not view all humans as equal or even deserving of equality. They frequently referred to the Native Americans as &quot;savages&quot;, like George Washington himself, whom, [in a letter to James Duane on September 7, 1783]((<a href="https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Washington/99-01-02-11798)referred">https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Washington/99-01-02-11798)referred</a> to the Indigenous populations of the Americas as &quot;savages&quot;.  </p>

<p>Even <a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/j/jala/2629860.0037.104/--native-americans-and-the-origins-of-abraham-lincolns-views?rgn=main;view=fulltext">Abraham Lincoln, the Great Emancipator</a>, the bearded figure who graces our currency and was immortalized at the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, was prejudice towards Natives- he ordered the largest mass execution in US History, of all Dakota Natives, yet never ordered the execution of a single Confederate soldier. His position on slavery and race are muddled at best- he may have been against slavery, but he didn&#39;t believe in racial equality- saying to his Senate opponent Stephen Douglas in an 1858 debate &quot;I will say then that I am not, nor ever have been, in favor of bringing about in any way the social and political equality of the white and black races...&quot;.  He basically said &quot;you&#39;re not animals, but you&#39;re still not yet human&quot;</p>

<p>These are men who have founded the cornerstones of our country and our beliefs, and way of living, and we hold them in such high esteem and in the highest of standards. We hold their beliefs as the ultimate way of living and still use their systems of capitalism and democracy as if they are the highest possible achievement of humanity, yet they are deeply entrenched in racism. Which is supported by something you have expressed below by stating &quot;if you live here you must acknowledge western values of having the utmost importance&quot;.  </p>

<p>So we can&#39;t address this privilege without looking at the political and economical aspects of it either.  </p>

<p>People of color are at a disadvantage politically and economically- they may have more rights now than ever, arguably, but we can&#39;t forget that Segregation was law barely 50 years ago. It took an entire century to go from being slaves to &quot;racial equality&quot;- you can&#39;t expect that in 50 years things have changed that much. There are people alive who didn&#39;t have the right to vote at one point in their life based on the color of their skin, so they had no say in the politics that dictated their life, and up until the 60&#39;s- people of color weren&#39;t able to pass an inheritance on to their children. That&#39;s an extreme disadvantage that takes more than a few generations to recover from.  Until 50 years ago, people of color weren&#39;t able to participate in society to the extent of everyone else, and were forced to uphold the fabric of society with little to no reciprocation through slavery and then the indentured servitude of the 13th amendment.  </p>

<p>I see that you commented on the incarceration rates of African-Americans, but it seems like you gave little to no thought about the environment they&#39;re being incarcerated in. Historically, until the past 50 years, and arguably even still today, they were in a system that didn&#39;t include them, and once they were considered human, the powers that be took advantage of that. The CIA has been smuggling drugs into areas with high populations of people of color since the 70s- funding drug dealers and gangs and the subsequent violence that destroys lives, homes and the communities, and fills up the private prison system that uses their funds to influence state and federal law, and contract work from companies as varied as Victoria Secret and the US Military.  </p>

<p>The effect this has on communities and culture is devastating. People growing up surrounded by violence, drugs, gangs, without parents, etc in a system that doesn&#39;t really include or support them in the way it does others. It&#39;s unimaginable. It further exacerbates the situation as well. There&#39;s a reason the most impoverished areas are also the highest populations of people of color- black, latino, asian, etc. It&#39;s not due to their own personal choices, but an environment orchestrated for them.</p>

<p>So saying that black people are more incarcerated than whites because of their choices is to be ignorant of reality. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s also the Tuskegee Experiment where African-American Air Force Members were injected with syphilis without their knowledge and allowed to go back out into the world and work jobs and have families and spread it and live with untreated syphilis, just to see what would happen!  </p>

<p>Then there&#39;s the criminalization of heroin by Nixon administration to destroy the Black Power movement.  </p>

<p>Aside from fact and statistics- my belief in white privilege comes from personal experience. Now, due to my distaste for the scientific community and it&#39;s &quot;facts&quot;, I hold personal experience, or &quot;anecdotal evidence&quot; in high regard- it&#39;s not a &quot;make or break&quot; process, but the complete disdain that the scientific establishment has for it as a way to dismiss beliefs that threaten it or don&#39;t coordinate with it is repugnant.  </p>

<p>I once dated a girl who was a Native, but if you didn&#39;t know it she could&#39;ve have been, and constantly was, mistaken for Latino or Hispanic, or even South Asian/Pacific Island. Whenever we would go out- even to the &quot;hip&quot; or &quot;progressive&quot; parts of town- we would get looks of disgust and judgement by other white people. It felt like we were living in the 1950s. The discomfort in the air, from both parties involved is so thick you can cut it with a knife. It is made very clear that you are not welcome and that your presence is threatening.<br/>
We felt out of place every where we went because we were usually the only interracial couple and you start to realize how homogenized the world we live in is- the US is set up for one particular culture and way of thinking and it doesn&#39;t allow room for other beliefs if you want to be &quot;successful&quot;- success being a particular conation rooted in the beliefs of Western Society.  </p>

<p>In my own individual experience, if I try to go against the main culture I&#39;m presented with extreme challenge and difficulty- I&#39;m sure those of you here in the conspiracy sub can relate- and i think that&#39;s an apparent issue of white privilege, that as I try to remedy it or go against it, or use it for good, I&#39;m met with extreme resistance from everyone else.  </p>

<p>I also had a conversation with a black friend of mine, who is one of the nicest, most giving people I&#39;ve ever met, and I was having some trouble understanding what I was experiencing, so we just started talking to me and he opened up about how once when he was a radio jockey, his boss called him and he answered the phone in his normal voice and the boss told him not to ever again speak like that- he essentially told him to speak more &quot;white&quot;- with a higher pitch, a different vernacular. He told me that he&#39;s never spoken to me with his &quot;real&quot; voice, the one he uses with his family and in his community. I was fucking astonished and saddened to not actually know my friend.  He also opened up about the oppression he faces in the work place where he&#39;s expected to dress a certain way- but not due to an official dress code, but more or less an unspoken societal one-  and when he does or doesn&#39;t he feels the affect- people aren&#39;t as open or friendly, and the energy of the room shifts. I know that I can go anywhere I want and where and do whatever I want and not be affected by the energy of other people.  If my black friend, who is a trainer, goes to his job wearing basketball shorts, he&#39;s considered &quot;unprofessional&quot;, yet my white friend wears basketball shorts to his IT job and he&#39;s accepted.  </p>

<p>I know you say, and believe, that &quot;if you live here you must hold western values with the utmost importance&quot;, and I&#39;m not sure how intensely you believe that but there was a time, and I won&#39;t speak on how it is still happening because it&#39;s beyond my current understanding, where the law was to assimilate everyone into American Culture. Native children were rounded up and taken to boarding schools- had their hair cut, their clothes changed and forced to speak in English. The same thing happened to Asians and African Americans. They were forced to abandon their beliefs in favor of American beliefs. And this isn&#39;t some ancient, centuries old practice. My exes grandmother was assimilated. She&#39;s in her 60s! She was taken from her family and forced to go to a school where the essentially eradicated her culture from her.  </p>

<p>Now imagine if that was happening today in the US, and we were being assimilated into Islamic culture... how upset would you be?  How oppressed would you feel? </p>

<p>Yet no one bats and eye, or hardly even knows about that- our history books are written from the perspective of the victor. Not the oppressed and abused. We only get one perspective of the world and it says that our countries history is justified and dignified and that we are all individuals with free-will and our actions determine our success in life.  It&#39;s not true.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s just so deeply intertwined with everything in our life that we don&#39;t see it, and we&#39;re taught not to see it, and when were&#39; confronted with it, we react defensively as if the struggles in our live couldn&#39;t possibly make us privileged, but that&#39;s not what white privilege is about. It&#39;s about a way of living and a culture where racism is so deeply engrained we are blind to it.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m going to end it here, because there&#39;s so much to it, especially a lot that I don&#39;t fully understand well enough to articulate, and we can continue to talk if you&#39;d like and I can address some more specifics and I may open up some more discussion based on what other people say.  </p>

<p>I would also highly recommend watching &quot;I Am Not Your Negro&quot;. You can research all you want but until you experience something first hand yourself, or consider someone else&#39;s first hand experience, you can&#39;t fully understand something. It&#39;s a phenomenal film, and even if you don&#39;t believe in white privilege, if you want to live in a fair and just world you have to consider other peoples realities, even if they contradict your own.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The whole concept of &#39;white privilege&#39; is the exact type of ideological taxonomy Mao used to vilify people (Except he tended to use social status over ethnicity, but when you hear people discuss what &#39;whiteness&#39; is, you realize that it&#39;s often used the same way in America). In fact, many of the terms Mao used for counter-revolutionaries roughly translate into the English concept &#39;privilege&#39; or various forms or another. It is a kind of labeling system seen broadly in witch hunter scenarios, a flexible label that can single handily reduce someone&#39;s position in another person&#39;s eyes and reduce any arguments they make to being simply propaganda from people looking to protect their &#39;privilege&#39; (Or ideology).</p>

<p>It&#39;s a very Kafka esque branding technique, if you are privileged and argue you aren&#39;t, it&#39;s only because you&#39;re afraid of admitting and losing it. Like if a Bourgeois in the cultural revolution argued against the methods, it&#39;s because he wants to keep his unjust wealth, or if he argued he wasn&#39;t a Bourgeois, it only proved he was because he was arguing against the revolutionaries! (And only a Bourgeois would do that). Or if a Communist in the U.S. argued during the McCarthy era, it&#39;s because he wanted to protect his subversive friends, and if he said he wasn&#39;t a Communist and was arguing because it was the right thing to do, it meant he obviously was a Communist because who else would argue with the very American Anti-American activities committee! It&#39;s a very old method to quickly side step rational critique by labeling the person, and having the label be set up so arguing against it proves it.</p>

<p>The whole recent PC movement has very troubling similarities with the cultural revolution; or at least the rhetoric which began it. Easy hatred for those perceived to be in power (Even if most of them aren&#39;t, they simply share a trait with those that are--like professors and political/business leaders both being educated, so obviously both are part of the same evil ruling class), a large label for those who seem to benefit from power (Even if most do not) and most of all (By far the most important) a scape goat for demagogues to blame difficult issues on. Something easy for the common person to digest, something easy to identify with and make out. (Really important when you&#39;re controlling a mob--you don&#39;t want to give the other person a chance to be a human, having a label that is quick to dispense and easy to ID makes it far easier for the mob to prevent the target from speaking.)</p>

<p>The point being that things like the cultural revolution rely on the market place of ideas being closed. &quot;White privilege&quot; is a concept Mao himself would have enjoyed a great deal, because it quickly distills a complex set of social issues down to &#39;this group is bad, don&#39;t discuss things with them&#39; (Even if the rhetoric around it says people shouldn&#39;t feel bad about their privilege--the way it&#39;s used in conversation is almost always meant to disrupt and shut down the conversation, or make the observations of those with privileged less poignant, less empathetic). This is the problem with broad labels--in reality, some people were just bad, or willfully mislead others, &#39;white privilege&#39; had nothing to do with it, it was based purely on ideological sympathies overruling empirical reality, which happens for every ideology; from Catholicism to Communism to Fascism (But this is another troubling similarity with the modern PC movement, that feelings towards things&gt;&gt;empirical evidence, which is a tactic Mao also liked to use, because it made it even easier to facilitate the above, where people can brush aside the empirical reality in order to defend their ideology, because it &#39;feels&#39; right. And making people &#39;feel&#39; good with righteous indignation is very easy, and a great way to manipulate a mob.).</p>

    <p class="byline text-muted mb-0"><a href="javascript:;" class="score"><span class="badge badge-secondary">1</span></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/ajohnson90.html">ajohnson90</a> 2017-11-26</p>
    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you that the term &quot;white privilege&quot; has some limitations in it&#39;s efficacy- language dictates so much of the way we think- and is manipulated by special interest groups for their own benefit- whether it&#39;s divide and conquer, suppression, etc. It certainly has it&#39;s limitations.  </p>

<p>That being said, I don&#39;t believe the concept itself is incorrect. It&#39;s very real, and I personally believe the fact that it&#39;s come into the collective awareness of our society has more to do with social progress than it does with manufactured intent.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe it&#39;s purpose is to be accusatory and dismissive, but to educate and create change, and I think it&#39;s hard to define exactly what &quot;white privilege&quot; is because of it&#39;s complexity.  </p>

<p>In my experience, I denied the terms of being called &quot;privileged&quot; and &quot;inherently racist&quot; because I didn&#39;t understand the person who was attaching those terms to me, and then through some very uncomfortable conversations I came to realize what they meant and how I was &quot;privileged&quot; and &quot;inherently racist&quot;. I didn&#39;t deny them because I was afraid of losing my privilege or being exposed as racist, but because I didn&#39;t see it, which is part and parcel of being privileged. I think the fact that it strikes a nerve with so many white people really means something, especially because they&#39;re just reacting to the accusation and not being able to see the reality being it, and I think as humans we often react negatively to being shown our true selves- like how we might judge someone for being selfish or annoying or whatever, but it&#39;s because we recognize ourselves within them that we have a problem with their behavior and we react to that discomfort with negativity and projection.  </p>

<p>I think it&#39;s important to listen to others and hear what they have to say and consider their reality- aka be empathetic- even if you don&#39;t believe it, they do, so to them, it is real. (That being said, if an idea is manufactured... it&#39;s hard to discern what is really &quot;real&quot;).<br/>
What you do with that information is then up to you.  </p>

<p>I realize this is probably what you mean by the &quot;PC Feel vs Empirical&quot; concept, but I think &quot;feelings&quot; have their own validity, in a way that empirical evidence doesn&#39;t (and vice versa), that we have to at least consider what those &quot;feelings&quot; are, instead of outright dismissing them. But I could be misinterpreting what you mean because I believe &quot;ideological sympathies&quot; are part of an &quot;empirical reality&quot; (like Kants view on subjectivity and objectivity)- which I&#39;m honestly don&#39;t have my thoughts gathered on it well enough to express what I mean, so if you happen to understand and maybe could lead me in a direction to someone who has already philosophized on it and read about it more, I&#39;d appreciate that. </p>

<p>I do just wish we could heal the racial divide, no matter what labels or concepts we attach to or take away from it.  </p>

<p>Thanks for the insightful conversation!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right but it&#39;s a byproduct of success. Think of it on a simpler basis, when we were cavemen the males who produced for the tribe (food, protection, shelter etc) had the &quot;privilege&quot; of choosing mates. </p>

<p>I do believe successful people reap the benefits of being successful, but in more cases than not, they earned it because they offered themselves and their &quot;product&quot; to the world and now the world thanks them. </p>

<p>How else would we ever get anything done? Our brain is based on a reward system at its most basic levels. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not the courts fault that an individual is financially irresponsible. At what point does somebody look in the mirror and say &quot;I am not where I want to be simply because I have not fully committed to achieving what I want&quot; I mean come on I understand that in the minority of cases some people can not care for themselves whether it&#39;s illness disability etc, but the vast majority of people in the United States are not successful simply because they&#39;re comfortable being where they are. Nobody forces anybody to live paycheck to paycheck, and at the same time nobody forces successful people to take the necessary steps to climb the ladder. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure thing </p>

<p>In a broader sense I (as a white dude) am less likely to be discriminated against when attempting to rent an apartment or when applying for a job (based on the whiteness of my name on a resume). I am not followed around department stores when shopping or harassed by security simply for cruising around a store without purchasing something (a thing I have seen happen many times from years of working at a large department store chain downtown). </p>

<p>As a white single straight dude I probably have the largest dating pool of eligible women to choose from, because of the inherent (or sometimes overt) biases of ladies when choosing a partner. </p>

<p>On a personal level, as a frequent pedestrian and sometimes driver in my diverse city, I am practically invisible to police officers - I can drink beer while walking or smoke a joint or simply be walking in a nice neighborhood and not get harassed, a privilege that my friends (who are not white) most definitively do not enjoy (and I have personally witnessed it, as well as frequent anecdotes from them - “driving while black” is an all too familiar “crime”  they get pulled over for). I am much less likely to be harassed for my casual drug use (I enjoy me some marijuana) than if I were non white, based on both personal experience and arrest rates for marijuana in my state. </p>

<p>I also get to enjoy the privilege of not having white people as a whole judged for the actions of the individual. Whereas people will say that the way an individual Black/Chinese/Mexican/etc acts is how <em>all</em> black/chinese/Mexican/etc act. It is something I’m aware of and I don’t take for granted. </p>

<p>This is just off the top of my head. I hope these examples helped, though I don’t pretend to be an expert (i am not an anthroplogist or sociologist or economist or whoever looks at all of that). </p>

<p>Glad I could contribute. </p>

<p>I grew up in a fairly white area, and once believed more or less as as OP did (though I’ll admit I didn’t give it TOO much thought). I had many eye opening years after moving to a large city and dramatically diversifying my friend group. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You’re more then welcome to, but I fear that you’re acting in bad faith. You didn’t “graciously let me express my opinion,” you asked me for examples, I provided them (and while some were anecdotal, they are based on true happenings that I have both witnessed and heard), and while I did not take the time to link specific papers and studies, I am now thankful that I did not waste my time doing so. </p>

<p>For some reason you chose to attack me for sharing these examples even after you asked for them, and now I fear I’ve wasted both my time and yours. You have obviously made a decision on this, and while you’re pretending to be looking for an honest conversation you’re simply looking for someone to battle with about the stance you’ve so firmly (and emotionally, I might add, in direct contrast to you subtitle) taken. </p>

<p>It seems the OP was looking for more “victims” to support his current mindset, not an actual discussion. To me, people like him are no better than some people of my race who constantly play the ”race card” to garner sympathy for themselves and not to the benefit of others.</p>

<p>I’m glad you don’t have “white guilt”, but just recognize that there are benefits to being white in today’s America. People like you are the future, OP unfortunately is just an unfortunate relic of the past.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey man, thanks. Since what I wrote was obviously what the OP was <em>not</em> looking for, I’m glad that other people can read it and it can make them think or give them some heart or something - so I didn’t completely waste my time :)</p>

<p>I stated it elsewhere but I grew up in a fairly homogenous area and never really had to think about any of this stuff (another privilege, natch), but after moving to a large city and diversifying the hell out of my friend group I gained some insight into what it’s like to grow up/live as a minority. </p>

<p>Obviously that’s <em>miles</em> away from actually living it, but I try my best to live a life of empathy and self reflection and all that fun stuff. I find these topics interesting in and of itself, but I find my friends even more interesting. And I love a good stony debate on, say, whether Bugs Bunny is a black dude or not (any thoughts? :) ). </p>

<p>Take care dude. </p>

<p>Your statistics sound great until they are faced with the cold hard truth that black men are arrested and involved in police activity directly in proportion to which they are committing crimes. </p>

<p>13% of our population is black yes</p>

<p>31% of victims are black men yes </p>

<p>What you leave out is the fact that same 13% of the population is responsible for over 50% of all violent crime in the US. Ever been to Chicago at night? </p>

Just dont come at a whole group of people based on the color of their skin alone and point hysterically and accuse them of being &#39;privledged&#39; when these things exist for one group and would be derided as &#39;racist&#39; if they were exclusive to so called &#39;white people&#39;.... </p>

<p>The only privledge that exists is that of class... If you get treated differently because of your skin color, then the person treating you differently is just a racist asshole and speaks only for themselves.</p>

<p>The way to change minds is not to go about accusing a whole group of being over privledged because this overlooks the likely mass majority of white people that just like every other poor person (regardless of skin color) are struggling to make ends meet and working 3 jobs to put food on the table... These people hear accusations cast at them about how they are &#39;privledged&#39; and you expect them to be receptive? </p>

But one should ask the question why this is so.<br/>
One can blame part of it on Hollywood and Bollywood for an extent.<br/>
But there is more to it then that.<br/>
Asians are also more likely to get a job or get into a university sins there precieved as very smart.<br/>
One of the things contributing to this as well is just statistics.<br/>
ia the middle east and Africa in general are shit hole,s.<br/>
Not all of it not all of em but its just clearly visible.<br/>
Same in places that have a lot of black people crime tends to be higher.<br/>
U can blame all of this on white privileged if u want but there is more to it then just that.        </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would say it’s real, but I feel as though the real question is, how does it relate to other forms of privilege that are rarely mentioned but have much if not greater impact, such as wealth, attractiveness, height, mental stability, economic stability (pretty easily achieved by the middle class with good budgeting practices, being bad with money is learned), age/youth, fast-twitch muscle capacity potential and of course, intelligence.</p>

<p>But if anything, I think the hoax/conspiracy has been the attempt to change the most widely understood meaning from “vast wealth” to this situation now where it’s only applied to “whiteness” and “maleness”. Before a few years ago, it only meant one thing 99% of the time it was used. If one was asked to use it in a sentence they would almost certainly mention money in some capacity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Everything I&#39;ve read on it basically suggests that to be what &quot;white privilege&quot; was all about. Calling it &quot;black/muslim/asian/literallyeverythingthatisn&#39;twhite non-privilege&quot; didn&#39;t roll off the tongue as well.</p>

<p>For those who don&#39;t know what the actual argument about white privilege is, it goes like this. &quot;assuming your life is 100% identical to someone else, but one of you is white and the other black, the white person is going to have an easier time.&quot;</p>

<p>That&#39;s it. That&#39;s all white privilege is. None of this &#39;REEEEE I HAVE A HARD TIME PAYING BILLS AND AM WHITE THEREFORE WHITE PRIVILEGE IS FAKE NEWS&#39; nonsense addresses the actual point that white privilege is meant to be about.</p>

<p>You get stopped by cops more, life is designed to cater to white people more (adverts, city design, etc) and people treat you like outsiders at best and invaders at worst. It&#39;s not like it was in the 20&#39;s, but it&#39;s still a subtle veil that lies over America and a lot of the western world.</p>

<p>Now is class based discrimination a thing? Oh yeah, 100%. Class and race are the venn diagram of discrimination in western society, probably all society. I do however feel it&#39;s disingenuous to pretend it&#39;s all about class and not about race at all.</p>

<p>That all said, most of the super whiny SJW types who shriek about it take it too far. It&#39;s not the active fault of anyone (outside of maybe law enforcement and a few other super high ranking positions that 99.99% of people will never see) but rather years of &quot;that&#39;s just how it goes&quot; to the point that nobody really talks about it. Naming this kind of phenomena was meant to make it easier to identify and talk about, but really it just seems to have made people mad because they either misinterpret it or take it personally.</p>

<p>At this point I would say it&#39;s like Gamergate. At its core a good idea worth talking about, but so stained by social stigma that its better off being dropped and rebranded to talk about at a later date.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s the gist of it, but to say that this isn&#39;t home for Black people is disingenuous. To say America is only the home of white people when they are not the first peoples here is disingenuous.</p>

<p>America decided a long time ago to be home of the free, no matter the creed or colour. That means talking about our problems instead of ignoring them, and that means fixing what we do wrong instead of doubling down on it.</p>

<p>Love of ones country comes with the responsibility of making that country the best that it can be, which means not trying to shame or remove those who critique it. Let those who speak be heard, and let those voices be weighed in the balance. That&#39;s what true freedom entails, that&#39;s what the country was meant to be. It gets closer every year, and that is only possible because of the hard work of the people who live there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because for some reason, seemingly sane individuals in our country have been brainwashed into feeling guilty for simply being white, as if no other race is guilty of an atrocity. Some argue the guilt is a by product of a grander scheme to dismantle western society and its current views to replace it with something more controllable than a free and open society that does not have a cohesive feeling of nationality like the US has in the past. I am not against a culturally diverse nation but I am a firm believer that if you live here you must acknowledge western values as the utmost importance. </p>

None of these things shouts out that POC as a group are &#39;under-privledged&#39;. I dont think anyone begrudges that POC have these things, welcome to them, enjoy... Just dont come at a whole group of people based on the color of their skin alone and point hysterically and accuse them of being &#39;privledged&#39; when these things exist for one group and would be derided as &#39;racist&#39; if they were exclusive to so called &#39;white people&#39;.... </p>

<p>The only privledge that exists is that of class... If you get treated differently because of your skin color, then the person treating you differently is just a racist asshole and speaks only for themselves.</p>

<p>The way to change minds is not to go about accusing a whole group of being over privledged because this overlooks the likely mass majority of white people that just like every other poor person (regardless of skin color) are struggling to make ends meet and working 3 jobs to put food on the table... These people hear accusations cast at them about how they are &#39;privledged&#39; and you expect them to be receptive? </p>
