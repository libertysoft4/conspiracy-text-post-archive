    <div class="md"><p>Can one really call the desire for truth an &quot;addiction&quot;? Think about it like this, its either you obsess over superficial trivialities or something that isnt trivial. It may seem draining because it is. Knowing your world is broken while everyone else has the wool over there eyes is a lot to deal with. But knowing this and then choosing tp ignore it will only be worse. Because you know now, and its impossible to really join back into the matrix once you leave. </p>

Enjoy life.. if you can’t balance the two or three then by simple math one or more things need to be taken to zero. Just put family above all else. If no one else is figuring things out jus know life will continue how it is until things get worse or better.. knowing information on conspiracies and such sounds foolish compared to spending time with family while it unravels. When the public knows about these conspiracies then so will you.. there is absolutely nothing you can do to prevent anything so just enjoy your family. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not a conspiracy addiction. You are just using this as an escape and an excuse to not be responsible. It is an issue of discipline more than anything else. I will tell you straight up, if you continue to act irresponsibly using conspiracies as an excuse, you will end up regretting it. As in you will fuck up your life and be one of those people that look back in regret. It will be too late then so realize that this is the path that&#39;s in store for you unless you start to take care of what you need to. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree, the cards are stacked against the upcoming generations. That&#39;s why it&#39;s even more important to stay focused and to do your absolute best to be ready for whatever is coming. Read. Exercise. Meditate.

    <div class="md"><p>Now while I still struggle to do all the side things. I believe societal achievements are basically the most important thing in this day and age? There are enormous amounts of pressure to go the extra mile, work hard, by yourself, gun on your waist, become hokage type of expectations, which seem impossible. I don&#39;t blame technology on the delayed maturity of adolescents, but I do. </p>

<p>Personally, I am in school right now and wanted to become a mechanical engineer. Although mainly, because of my mental health problems am struggling at school and seeing my future. I have absolutely no interests in transferring to a program or university to rack up debt that is not guaranteed to be paid off by a job in the field of my degree. I also cannot rack up debt, because there is no guarantee I myself will succeed and do not have a safety net to fall on. I don&#39;t come from a family where I can change majors or fail a few times before figuring it out for myself. </p>

<p>What do I do in the mean time? Pick up a part time job, continue living with my parents while staying in school taking classes here and there waiting to see how the market and technological advancements change the path for my future? I am not blaming <em>all</em> my problems on <em>the man</em>, but holy shit if highschool had prepared me better, or I could access adequate mental health resources I could be doing a whole lot better than I am now. Not all hope is lost for myself, but I am just saying that this 18-25 area is not just pleasure land. Suicide rates are rising for a reason. Isolation is rising as well. There were many different factors to be attributed other than a lack of maturity. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand where you are coming from. The cards <em>are</em> stacked up against 18-25 year olds about to enter into adult hood. I will push back though on the notion that societal achievements are the most important thing. At the end of the day, it&#39;s going to be how you feel on the inside that matters. And this you do have control over because it&#39;s not so much what you achieve before society, but how true you were to yourself. Nobody ever beats themselves up for giving their best, even if they fail. It may sting at first if you do, but in the long run, there will be a deep peace that emerges from knowing that you did what you could do. It all begins and ends with what kind of attitude and mindset you employ during these turbulent times. The magic word is Courage. Meditate on it and become it. The reason why I recommend you meditate and exercise is because being physically strong often translates to mental strength. While building discipline, it will also toughen you up to have this courageous attitude towards life that I am preaching.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah yes. I probably should of expanded on societal achievements. I agree that intrinsic self-worth is definitely the most important thing. What I meant was that in this culture and society, it is not. I know myself and my peers have massive amounts of pressure to do well in school and become whatever we want to succeed and become independent from our parents. That&#39;s fine except when we have absolutely no idea what we want to do for the rest of our lives and whether that will still exist by the time we&#39;re under mountains of debt. The fundamental aspects of being able to support one&#39;s self is fading and hinders all other things in life. </p>

This article is a fascinating read about how many of the inventors of the addictive features in our technology are abstaining from tech and regret making what they did: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/oct/05/smartphone-addiction-silicon-valley-dystopia">https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/oct/05/smartphone-addiction-silicon-valley-dystopia</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just remember that taking in all of this info is something most people DONT do, so try not to blow their minds or even try and convince them of anything. They are still asleep, if anything give them gentle nudges towards things but try not to divulge too much at once. People will wall up and shake their heads. </p>

<p>As far as unplugging from the media/conspiracy news, just take a break man. The world will still be here tomorrow, and there will be a whole new set of scandals and tretchery.
You knowing everything wont solve much..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve come to accept the fact that I&#39;ll never know everything. That helped me stop trying to figure it all out. So constantly checking for updates really isn&#39;t helping you because no matter how much time you put in, there&#39;s questions that can&#39;t be answered. Take a break. Trust me, all this information will be here when you come back.</p>
