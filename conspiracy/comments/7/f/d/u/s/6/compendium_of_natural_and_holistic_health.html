        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I have crippling avoidant personality disorder and depression. When I was 18 I was put on antidepressants and then soon after that, antipsychotics. I haven&#39;t been on them for a few years now. But I feel as if they have permanently alerted my brain for the worse. Because while my untreated disorders grow worse with time, from the moment I took the pills it was if something changed.</p>

<p>Anyway, I have tried a few different natural therapies since then. It&#39;s been years now without success. Mostly the &#39;go-to&#39; herbs and supplements such as St Johns Wort, SAMe, B vitamins etc. I hope I&#39;ll find something that relieves my anxiety. My main concern is the brain fog and derealisation that comes with my particularly relentless depression. </p>

<p>I was homeless when I was 20 and lived for a while in a shelter for other homeless men. There was one man who talked to himself all the time. You could hear it all the time whenever you walked past his dorm. I remember thinking &#39;Thank heavens I&#39;m not going to turn out like him&#39;. Fast forward to today, I talk to myself sometimes without even knowing I am. The same sort of negative stuff as that homeless guy used to say. A few times I&#39;ve done it in front of people and not realizing until it was too late. This has to stop before I lose my mind completely before I&#39;m even 30. </p>

<p>Can we please discuss all the different holistic therapies available? I need some new ideas and things to try, and I&#39;m sure others will find inspiration from it as well. Mods please don&#39;t delete if this sounds off-topic, we all know that human health is being repressed and prevented from its full potential. It&#39;s a conspiracy and I&#39;m a product of TPTB&#39;s harm and wrongdoing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>bro when i got sick i became obsessed with natural healing and reading books on natural healing.   i;m 44 now and the healthiest i have ever been.   there is so much to learn and yet it is actually a simple truth.</p>

<p>i can lend/send you a few books or lectures if you like.  but mostly it boils down to detoxification + putting nutrients back in the body.  and also when you are better enough... you start to cleanse the colon and then the lymphatic system via exercise.
each body is self healing as we know so everything can be help.  but its about breaking bad habits.  and most do struggle to do that.</p>

<p>but there is a lot where to start.   probably if you can tell me your symptoms we can start from there.</p>

<p>you see doctors will treat symptoms, wheras a healer will treat causes.   this video really helped me when i was sick... see if it resonates and get back to me   :D   pm me if you like   i&#39;m in UK where are you.   <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OO4-YQldOYY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OO4-YQldOYY</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you. Can we continue a conversation through PM then? I&#39;ll explain what&#39;s wrong with me and what I&#39;ve tried. Only if you have the time though. </p>

<p>I just bought a juicer recently to try have more fresh juice. I can use this for the blast right? I bought the juicer after great consideration and caution that possibly most juicers are harmful to the nutrients and enzymes. But the guy in the vid uses a cold press juicer. Too late for me, already spent $$$ on my Breville. </p>

<p>So assuming you practice what you preach, are you a vegan?</p>

<p>Research it. Maybe get tested?</p>

<p>Aside from that, eat clean. No GMOs or processed foods. Look into keto and paleo diets for treating anxiety. Get off sugar and carbs. Feed the brain protein and healthy fats to heal it.</p>

<p>Tryptophan can stimulate antidepressant effects.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you. Can we continue a conversation through PM then? I&#39;ll explain what&#39;s wrong with me and what I&#39;ve tried. Only if you have the time though. </p>

<p>I just bought a juicer recently to try have more fresh juice. I can use this for the blast right? I bought the juicer after great consideration and caution that possibly most juicers are harmful to the nutrients and enzymes. But the guy in the vid uses a cold press juicer. Too late for me, already spent $$$ on my Breville. </p>

<p>So assuming you practice what you preach, are you a vegan?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I actually know of Dr Sebi, funnily enough. He came up when I was searching for a cure to something I&#39;d rather not say (not mental health related). I believe in a cure for mental health through nutrition and stuff, but no cure for this other thing I won&#39;t mention, because shame. </p>
