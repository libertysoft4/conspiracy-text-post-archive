<p>It seems the elite do believe something along these lines, that Lucifer is the good guy bringing light/knowledge/self-awareness.</p>

<p>I think there&#39;s also a gnostic text where at the last supper Jesus starts laughing at the Apostles, I can&#39;t remember which one it was.</p>

<p>I&#39;m interested in what the elite really believe.   It&#39;s hard to know whats true with so many viewpoints (like what evil power is behind the elite, some say satan, others a Saturn matrix computer.</p>

<p>I do not know precisely know the answer to your question in the title.  Their idea of Lucifer being the righteous one and Adonai being the unrighteous one goes back further to ancient Egypt and even further to ancient Babylon.  The first king of Babylon, Nimrod loosely means rebel against God in the Bible.  In the Babylonian mysteries, Nimrod represents the Sun or Lucifer.</p>

<p>The elite believe that what we call &quot;reality&quot; is just the sum-total of our collective understanding and beliefs... and by manipulating these beliefs they can effect the outcome of events. </p>

<p>Evil is real, though. Meaning: an <em>external</em> force exists that actively seeks to limit humanity as a whole. <em>It</em> is capable of employing any one of us at any moment to be its agent, through the process of belief. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The ultra elite believe they&#39;re descendants of the Nephilim, who came from the sons of God copulating with the daughters of men. This is why they are so obsessed with inter family breeding amongst their stock. They believe that they have a divine right to rule because of this.</p>

<p>The ultra elite act in direct defiance to God. Their evil ways is what brought the flood. Then to defy God they built the tower of Babyl. Until he scattered them and confused their languages. The UN building is the modern day Tower of Babyl. </p>

<p>So they want to keep control over us and piss off God it seems. I&#39;ve heard speculation that CERN is trying to open a portal to let the fallen angels out of their prison. The prison they were sent to after the deluge. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s very interesting, I haven&#39;t read they believe they are descendants of the Nephilim.  I thought the Nephilim would have died in the flood?  But they didn&#39;t die but were put in a prison?  I was thinking maybe greek/roman &quot;gods&quot; like HErcules was a mix of fallen angel/human.  </p>

<p>Also when God told Israel to wipe out all the people in a location (I forget where), I read that it was because they were half Nephilim.  Some people claim God was a monster for telling His people to wipe out even women and children.  Idk, either way after original sin any amount of suffering on Earth for 80 years is insignificant in light of eternity.</p>

<p>Have any YouTube video&#39;s or websites on the subject?</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>I thought the Nephilim would have died in the flood?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They managed to survive somehow. There&#39;s a scripture that says:</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The Nephilim were on the earth in those days--and also afterward--when the sons of God went to the daughters of humans and had children by them. They were the heroes of old, men of renown.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>It says &quot;and also afterward&quot;. How they survived it is all speculation though. The fallen angels may have given them a heads up to build their own ark.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I read that it was because they were half Nephilim. Some people claim God was a monster for telling His people to wipe out even women and children</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The book I&#39;m reading, &quot;The Genesis 6&quot; by Gary Wayne, makes the case that they were in fact nephilim. That would really explain why God of the OT seems like such a contradicting dick. He traces through their history and builds a pretty strong case using scripture and other pieces of evidence. I strongly recommend this book or any of Gary&#39;s many videos on YouTube. </p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>Isaiah 45:7 King James Version (KJV)</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>7 I form the light, and create darkness: <em>I make peace, and create evil:</em> I the Lord do all these things.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Lord creates both good and evil. </p>

<p>The earth right now is controlled by the Devil because the LORD said that is what he wants, not because he is battling him. We get this from Job Chapter 1</p>

<p><strong>Job 1 King James Version (KJV)</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>1 There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared God, and eschewed evil.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Skip to 6</p>

<blockquote>
<p>6 Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord, <strong>and Satan came also among them.</strong></p>

<p>7 And the Lord said unto Satan, <strong>Whence comest thou? Then Satan answered the Lord, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>We see from this that Satan is Yah&#39;s creation he was created to do evil all through the world.</p>

<p>We even see that Yah himself gives the earth to Satan at one point but will take it back from him later. All the while, Satan himself knows what his duty is while he is king of the earth.</p>

<p><strong>Job 9:24 King James Version (KJV)</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>24 <strong>The earth is given into the hand of the wicked:</strong> he covereth the faces of the judges thereof; if not, where, and who is he?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks, helpful verses.  I remembered God creating evil or destruction.  For God to know his Creation before creating it, it would seem that He wrote this entire story.

<p>But idk, I feel like God somehow made it where we have free will while he ordains everything, separating Himself from sin since He doesn&#39;t sin, but He created beings He knew would sin.</p>

<p>16 And Jacob begat <strong>Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>We have to remember that God set formulas for the Bible (Laws, Statues and Commandments). </p>

<p>It was always by the fathers line for the Israelites.</p>

<p><strong>Numbers 1:18 (KJV)</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>18 And they assembled all the congregation together on the first day of the second month, <strong>and they declared their pedigrees after their families, by the house of their fathers</strong> according to the number of the names, from twenty years old and upward, by their polls.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So we see that it was always through the fathers line that made one an Israelite.</p>

<p>We even see that before they were married according to Israelite customs, she was pregnant, hence why some might have taken it as a virgin birth.</p>

<p><strong>Matthew 1:19-21 (KJV)</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>19 Then Joseph her husband, being a just man, <strong>and not willing to make her a public example, was minded to put her away privily.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>You don&#39;t need the book of Enoch, if it were important it would have came when King James placed the scriptures in the bastard tongue 400 years ago. </p>

<p>The purpose is to understand that God is a terrible power to piss off.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. You are not understanding. The documents that you are trying to provide have just been found. I like to look at it this way, the older the information the more proof that it withstood the test of time. </p>

<p>If the book of Enoch truly is perfect, then it will encompass the same thing that the King James 1611 including the Apocrypha does. If it doesn&#39;t, then there is reason to believe tampering. </p>

<p>Have you yourself tested it&#39;s strength against the King James? Probably not. This is the reason why if you read the Bible, it&#39;s not just some comic book where one story matters but the entire thing. Noah&#39;s flood is found within The Holy Bible.</p>

<p>The point you tried to make was also moot as you simply read my post wrong. I never said God flooded the earth to piss people off. </p>

<p>I said the earth pissed him off and he flooded the world, thus he is a terrible power to piss off.</p>

<p>Then I quoted </p>

<p><strong>Proverbs 1:7 King James Version (KJV)</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>7 The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge: but fools despise wisdom and instruction.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is fear and humbleness that will be our salvation for LOVE IS FEAR OF THE LORD. </p>

<p>How does one fear the Lord?</p>

<p>By following his laws statues and commandments to the best of your abilities. </p>

<p>Everything is dual; everything has poles; everything has its pair of opposites; like and unlike are the same; opposites are identical in nature, but different in degree; extremes meet; all truths are but half-truths; all paradoxes may be reconciled.

<p>Everything has two sides, everything has an opposite. Yin and Yang is an ancient Taoist teaching to explain duality in the universe.

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;ve never heard of yin and Yang? Brahman? The concept that we all is one. Without sin there is no redemption. Without trials and tribulations there is no growth. Without darkness there is no light. Without this dichotomy there would be no <em>living</em> because friction and static is what drives it all. </p>

<p>We can debate whether there are subdivisions of the One, and whether they are sentient forms of consciousness with personal goals, but that doesn&#39;t change that in the end, it is all One. It&#39;s simple math. If you are hung up on the Abrahamic framework you need to be asking yourself why god created evil. Was it a necessary means to an end that few if any can truly understand?</p>
