<p>Over 200 people died in Egypt today, and I feel like it&#39;s already old news, the world moves so fast that nothing has time to sink in, no information is absorbed, it just bounces off the surface of our minds as we sprint through life.</p>

<p>The biggest mass shooting in American history happened 2 months ago and barely any information is actually confirmed, but I only ever see any discussion of it here on this sub. More coverage of some non-event in London today took place tbh. </p>

<p>There&#39;s no real point to this post, but I have to vent some frustration that I have for this horrible existence that I regret waking up to. I live a relaxed and relatively happy life but I can&#39;t stand how the world works, it is really painful to be a part of this mess. Is there any hope...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My mental health was getting fairly terrible for a couple years and one day I just had enough of it. If I may, I&#39;d like a moment of your time to hopefully change your perspective. Nobody is making you follow the news religiously. The world has a shitload of potential for there to be good, but will only re-align for good when enough people decide it&#39;s time. Until then, the bad will rule the airwaves. </p>

<p>If you&#39;re posting in these parts, you probably already know the jist of what&#39;s going on. That being, corrupt governments, wealthy elites, organized crime, etc., Throughout all of history it has been there. And for the indefinite time-being it will persist. </p>

<p>The news cycle is a nothing more than rollercoaster. You choose to be on it and follow it. Just like real rollercoasters, people who don&#39;t like them can choose to say &quot;I don&#39;t like going on rollercoasters&quot; and wait outside of the line. Until you decide to check out, you&#39;ll  check the news each day and see something just as terrible or more terrible than the past. There might be months where the shift goes from terrorists bombings to Bruce Jenner, but you&#39;ll always end back up on that rollercoaster that seems to be making you miserable. </p>

<p>Just as terrible people do horrible things to others, you&#39;re doing something terrible to yourself by following that news and seeing the horrors which you cannot prevent or escape. </p>

<p>Maybe it&#39;s your time to take the next step and distance yourself from said media sources and find other fulfillment in life. Even if the world magically fixes itself, it&#39;s not going to happen for decades. You can sit by and watch the shitshow, or find your own corner of the world to make your sanctuary. It might take years of hell to get something stable or better, but if you are smart with your money, cheap, and play by the rules you&#39;ll get somewhere eventually. </p>

<p>Just remember: the organizations/people doing terrible shit like [allegedly] Paddock/ISIS gain power through attention. Paddock [or the culprit(s) of the false flag] knew there&#39;d be a villain when the act was committed. If no one paid attention to it, he&#39;d lose the power he gained by doing so. </p>

<p><strong>So I guess what I&#39;m saying is: if you already see the light, should you really keep staring into the sun?</strong> </p>

<p>If the powers that be choose to make their curtain call all of us peasants are along for the same ride. </p>

<p>The conspiracy community will persist without you. Information will continue to spread without you. If it&#39;s bad for your health and no longer beneficial for you to go down the rabbit hole, step away until it is - whether that be temporary or forever.</p>

<p>I wish you peace and the best.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No that is wrong, these things are just not as bad as they used to be and overall crime is down a TON. Now we actually hear about every shooting or death everywhere on this planet of 7 billion and think they are happening next door. Things are just too good right now so people don&#39;t really care because it isn&#39;t gonna get them too like the mysterious AIDS, cancer, TB and other scares of the old days.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Far too many things going in the world that turning from tragedies and moving forward is easier than ever.</p>

<p>The Internet has opened up vast channels for everyone to communicate and find one another, but it is dividing communities up as the people that make them up rather find others with similarities.</p>

<p>Religion kept people unified around the world. It was a way of life despite language barriers. Now if you want to be on Twitch all day, drinking sodas, and listening to kpop you can find a community online that will enforce that for you.</p>

<p>As we slip further and further away from a agreeable reality I don’t see how to fix this other than a world order with open borders allowing people to fuck off into different territories. A mass re-alignment of people. Unfortunately, that too will probably be struggle as bad people will see an opportunity for a power grab.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jesus truly is the answer. I have essentially zero doubt that I would have checked out of this existence a decade ago if I didn&#39;t have a personal relationship with Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>I never want to be over-the-top about such things but, OP sounds in legit mental pain and knowing I was there myself and knowing now about the love Jesus has for literally every single one of us INDIVIDUALLY and that is with 100% knowledge of every wretched screw up one has committed!!</p>

<p>I REALLY just wish everybody who is in similar pain could find Jesus&#39; love the way I have. Does life still suck at times sure but, I just cannot overstate what personally praying to Jesus and learning about him and the things he has done in others&#39; lives is such a pivotal thing that if I didn&#39;t find Jesus I would not be here today.</p>

<p>I just want everyone to know Jesus and the love he has for every freaking one of you!!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jesus is the truth. he found me when i wasn&#39;t even looking for him, but when i was looking for something to put my hope and faith in. I am very grateful to Him (but not enough) and am unashamed to share with others He is my truth and savior. There are people who go their whole lives looking for the peace and knowledge i have gained in my rebirth in Christ. Praise Jesus. take care brother. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Embrace your own spiritual journey. Religion stagnates your spiritual journey more than most other things. False certainty ends the journey. Religion is false certainty. Spirituality is an open minded quest for the truth about existence and the best ways  we could interact with one another. You don&#39;t even have to believe in a creator to practice it. I strongly suggest Albert Einstein was a spiritual thinker. His quotes reveal it to us, not his pomp.</p>

<p>&quot;I am convinced that He (God) does not play dice.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Great spirits have often encountered violent opposition from weak minds.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Common sense is the collection of prejudices acquired by age eighteen.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Technological progress is like an axe in the hands of a pathological criminal.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Peace cannot be kept by force. It can only be achieved by understanding.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We can&#39;t solve problems by using the same kind of thinking we used when we created them.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Too many of us look upon Americans as dollar chasers. This is a cruel libel, even if it is reiterated thoughtlessly by the Americans themselves.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Heroism on command, senseless violence, and all the loathsome nonsense that goes by the name of patriotism -- how passionately I hate them!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;My religion consists of a humble admiration of the illimitable superior spirit who reveals himself in the slight details we are able to perceive with our frail and feeble mind.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A man&#39;s ethical behavior should be based effectually on sympathy, education, and social ties; no religious basis is necessary. Man would indeed be in a poor way if he had to be restrained by fear of punishment and hope of reward after death.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The further the spiritual evolution of mankind advances, the more certain it seems to me that the path to genuine religiosity does not lie through the fear of life, and the fear of death, and blind faith, but through striving after rational knowledge.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If people are good only because they fear punishment, and hope for reward, then we are a sorry lot indeed.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Coincidence is God&#39;s way of remaining anonymous.&quot;</p>

<p>Secondly, make an honest assessment on what you can actually influence and change for the better. Start with <a href="https://pics.me.me/network-dream-big-plan-ahead-get-up-early-stay-focused-14586804.png">yourself.</a> If you get your own life in order and have an heart to make the world a better place, doors will open up for you.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As you start to walk on the way, the way appears. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lastly, this is related to the first two but have a spiritual practice. I&#39;m not telling you to go to church like some of these other guys but do what brings you peace and gives you strength. In my experience, God or whatever you want to call it, exists and can be reached. </p>

<p>Good luck and wish you all the best.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gotquestions.org/Satan-god-world.html">https://www.gotquestions.org/Satan-god-world.html</a></p>

<p>Instead of giving up, why not live your life in service to God?  He offers his love. grace. and salvation from this world.  Maybe you can also restore a bit of faith you had in humanity in the meantime.</p>

<p>Satan&#39;s influence is spreading.  I believe it is only a matter of time before the prophecy is fulfilled when Jesus returns to set things right.  Until then, I try to be patient and keep the faith.  I believe He won when Jesus died upon the cross.  I believe that all we have to do is accept that Jesus died upon the cross for the forgiveness of our sins and that Jesus is the Son of God in order to be saved.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s one solid reason I can give you to remain hopeful. </p>

<p>For all of recorded history, the interaction you and I are having could never have existed. And here I am, offering encouragement to a stranger, who might live on the opposite side of the globe as I do. Now we have the power to build one another up even if they&#39;re not on the same continent as we are. We can share information with anyone, anywhere, and be a source of positivity and growth that can literally span the globe. 30 years ago, all we had access to were the people in our own immediate community. And now, we have access to everyone. That is a huge, huge power, and it&#39;s completely changing the course of our evolution as a result. </p>

<p>Choose to do good things with it. Every action we take creates a series of events that stretches out into infinite. Put your hand to good things, and those good things will exist forever, rippling out into our world and the cosmos forever, long after we are dead and gone. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>When the events of Las Vegas were taking place, I honestly felt nothing. I was even having a conversation with my cousin the next morning, and I told her how desensitized I was to it. Things like that happen. Not all the time, but they do. In a way, they&#39;re unavoidable. If they&#39;re not shooting people, they&#39;re running them over. If they&#39;re not using knives, they&#39;ll use something else. 
People kill people. It&#39;s sad, but that&#39;s what some humans have it in us to do without provocation.</p>

<p>The strange events of why they held that Las Vegas information did wake me up though. That event is the reason why I joined this Reddit site. I wanted answers that I wasn&#39;t getting.</p>

<p>As far as the other bombings and shootings, if most people don&#39;t care about what&#39;s happening in Yemen/Syria, why would they care about anything else outside their circle? The world is a pretty sad place. I hope everyone would at least have something positive (wife, child, family, friends, job) that makes them feel happy.</p>

<p>Nature of reality/existence is of Oneness. Everything is Divine, there is only truly Freewill. Law of One also talks about the creation story of &quot;God&quot;/existence as well:

<p>The heart of your journey is to seek the Creator that is within you, the Creator that you are, the Creator that is all things. There can be no other way of looking upon an infinite creation of unity. The Creator took pleasure in making this, what you call creation, in order that it might know itself through the free will of each of its entities that it has created. From the Logos of every star within your skies, to the planet upon which you dwell, to each of your entities that you share the illusion with, each of you has free will to exercise however you wish. Each exercise of free will teaches the Creator more of itself, and fulfills the purpose of the illusion. Each of your actions reveals more to you of yourself, and if you are conscious of the seeking process, of the Creator itself, it is a journey of lovers, the creator loving you with unending love, you seeking and loving the Creator with a growing love. At some point, you will find the Creator, there is no other outcome for the end of this journey. At some point, the creator will know all that you know and will thank you for all that you have taught it of itself. At some point every entity within this great one infinite creation will coalesce again into unity, bringing home to the Creator the fruits of this journey through the octave of densities in which you now travel.

<p>as well as </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Let us look first at the first choice and that was the choice of the Creator to know Itself. In choosing to know Itself the Creator flung from Itself innumerable and infinite sparks of love which coalesced into each awareness that dwells within the infinite awareness. Each of those sparks of awareness is the Creator, and yet, because the Creator chose free will in the manifesting of sparks of self, each spark is unique and has been unique since before time began. Each of you is eternal and in many ways immutable, a citizen of infinite nature, worth and value. Each one a holograph of the Creator and yet each one different.
Thus, the choice that birthed each of you was a choice to know the truth, to know the self, and as the Creator is love, so is each entity love. This is the central truth. This is that which does not change. Yet this is that which is ever wrapped in mystery. Each within this circle has come through many planes of existence, has learned a great deal, and each within this circle chose not only this incarnation now being experienced but also that cast of characters with whom each entity interacts in the family, in the close associations of friends, and all those who have significant connections with the self. There were agreements made before incarnation, most notably with the parents and those within the bonds of kinship of blood and of commonality of interest. Each difficulty, each crux that leaves one in a position of being forced to discover the self has been placed not with a hand that desires to punish but with a hand of loving self that wishes to serve ever more deeply, ever more purely. -Q&#39;uo @the_law_of_one (May 18, 1997)</p>
