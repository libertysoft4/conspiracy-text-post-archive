    <div class="md"><p>I think we&#39;ve had a few posts on it, but it doesn&#39;t hurt to get a few more eyes to see it. </p>

<p>On some level, it could actually be a fairly interesting revenue model, with quite a few advantages over the ad-based model. First, internet ads are pretty questionable in their usefulness. They&#39;ve gotten so bad that many people just use ad blockers, which leads to more obtrusive ads, which leads to more ad blockers. </p>

<p>Second, it would give content-creators much more freedom in how they create content. If your content needs to be &quot;advertiser friendly&quot; in order to make money, it limits what many people are willing to say. Crypto mining could let you support content creators for relatively cost to yourself. </p>

<p>I do think Salon&#39;s implementation seems a bit shady, though. Or maybe I just think that because it&#39;s salon.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, my understanding of brave is that you can deposit cryptocoin with them monthly or over some period, and then distribute it based on how often you use each site, or can divide it up in other ways. Brave then groups payments and disburses them to individual sites. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like the idea of Internet services using distributed computing for crypto mining or other purposes in place of advertising. The idea has definitely been discussed here before. </p>

<p>This should be explained clearly to the end-user that this is happening, but it&#39;s not the worst thing ever if they didn&#39;t. I&#39;d honestly rather have a site do this without telling me than show me horrible ads. Fuck advertising as an industry, that shit is toxic. This FAQ seems to spell out exactly what they&#39;re doing though, so that&#39;s good. I&#39;d love to see this happen more. </p>

<p>I mean, can you imagine if playing World of Warcraft was paid for just by sharing your CPU while the game was running? There&#39;s a lot that can be done with this kind of distributed computing technology and the idea of using it for cryptocurrencies. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Speaking of their use in video games, there are cryptos that are designed to be used instead of in-game coins, so you can attach a real value to your digital items. Then, be able to sell those items and use the money to buy something else. Imagine being able to buy a character in Fortnite, then being able to sell that character and use the money to buy a pack in FIFA. Blockchain is gonna be revolutionary. </p>
