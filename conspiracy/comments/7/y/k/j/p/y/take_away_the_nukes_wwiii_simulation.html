        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Let’s assume that the US and Russia have some crazy secret space-borne defense systems we don’t know about. That’s one layer of nuclear defense. MAD is another layer. Preemptive strikes would be another layer but let’s just say no nukes are fired. </p>

<p>WWIII is started by one of these 5 flashpoints</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Syria; tension between Turkey/Israel and Russia/Syria brings in US involvement. </p></li>
<li><p>Ukraine/Baltic; Russia decides to invade Eastern Europe, for one reason or the other. </p></li>
<li><p>North Korea; Russia and China come to the defense of NK when SK and US attack, due to NK incursions.</p></li>
<li><p>Venezuela/Brazil; revolution and conflict in South America. Brazil invades rest of continent with help of China. </p></li>
<li><p>Pakistan/India; most tense conflict zone as it is <em>unknown which side either country would be on</em>. It would depend on what else was going on, but let’s just assume India sides with Russia and China for ha ha’s (I think it’s slightly more likely they would ally with the US-UK Alliance). </p></li>
</ol>

<p>So what happens? No nukes. </p>

<p>China has the manpower, Russia has the oil. Brazil has isolation. Their allies; Iran, North Korea, Syria, Lebanon, and probably Iraq serve as the first battlegrounds, as well as the whole of Eastern Europe, which Russia invades. </p>

<p>The US, UK, EU, Turkey, South Korea, Japan, Israel, Canada, Saudi Arabia, Australia and New Zealand make up the other team. Vast technological advantage but outnumbered. </p>

<p>What would be the Allies strategy? </p>

<p>Also, in this scenario where US, EU, China and Russia have impenetrable nuclear defense, perhaps the Middle East countries, India, and Pakistan don’t. We surely would see <em>some</em> nukes. Most likely victims would be Syria (from Israel), Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, and India. </p>

<p>I think a land invasion of China or the US would go horribly for the invading force. However, it does seem that the US is being sabotaged from the inside. </p>

<p>If we all the sudden had 2 million Chinese and Korean soldiers land on the west coast we might be fucked.</p>

<p>I think Allied strategy would focus on knocking out China via bombardment of cities like Shanghai and Beijing, in tandem with taking down Middle East. Russia would be last as they are the most battle hardened and would require a real effort.</p>

<p>I think China would capitulate after suffering enough, so long as a fair diplomatic solution was present. I don’t think Russia or its Muslim allies would surrender so easily.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The US, Russia, and China are the major players. China had three options:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Side with Russia </p></li>
<li><p>Side US</p></li>
<li><p>Stay neutral</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I think it sees the US as a threat and an obstacle; they’re stockpiling, hoarding gold and resources. They’re going to prepared for a war by 2030. That war may never come, but they’ll be ready. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why would China think Russia is an ally worth risking destruction over? Russia spends a TENTH of what we spend on our military, China spends a third. China isn&#39;t stupid, the smart bet would be to obviously ally with the EU and US and have Russia surrounded. </p>

<p>Ignoring nukes takes away literally the only chance Russia has of waging a war against the EU+USA+SA, let alone those three and China. There isn&#39;t some magic to Russia, they can&#39;t turn 60 million in modern military spending into 600 million.</p>

<p>That&#39;s ignoring the Naval supremacy located in the Pacific, &quot;2 million Chinese and Korean soldiers land on the west coast&quot; how are they gonna get there? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand that^ but if nukes are out of the picture you gotta realize that the US is spread thin. Compared to Russia and China, Europe is soft. They would absolutely crumble in the face of Russia’s <em>15,000+</em> tanks, which outguns the US if I’m not mistaken. </p>

<p>With Russia focused on Europe, its Air Force supporting its Arab allies, and China and NK fighting all over Asia the US would be hard pressed to attack anyone. </p>

<p>We have trouble with insurgents, now invoke three or four different theatres of war and no the US not by default have naval superiority in the Pacific. If we <em>committed</em> our ships to the South China Sea we could firebomb southeastern China for sure, but how many of those resources would be needed for the Persian Gulf, Indian Ocean, or Caribbean? Areas that the US had few ships and areas where our allies would be pressed. </p>

<p>In this scenario, North Korea, Syria, Iran, India, Lebanon, Belarus, Brazil, Venezuela and several other countries would have allied with BRICS. </p>

<p>US <em>could</em> land invade Russia or China, but only one at a time and with heavy casualties. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not a &quot;ooh-rah&quot; US military might person at all but it&#39;s really just numbers. Russia moving immidiately would be able to take the Baltics, absolutely (retake former Soviet land) but would be stopped by a combined EU+US force. The US has such little risk of attack (geographically) and such a head start it&#39;d be laughable. The US alone (without the EU) has a massive advantage in troop and equipment moving ability over RU.</p>

<p>Like including Brazil (lol) and Iran is cute, but realistically Israel would be happily bombing Iran immediately and why would Lebanon and Iraq(lol) be involved at all, it&#39;s a no win for them.</p>

<p>China/NK wouldn&#39;t get to Hawaii with landing craft, let alone the West Coast (do you know how many ships it would take to move 2 million soldiers?) Have fun with those vastly technologically advanced subs, y&#39;all.</p>

<p>I think you&#39;re conflating economic agreements with military ones. I just don&#39;t think China would even involve itself...cause what would they gain?</p>

<p>The entire scenario of a third world war is a figment of the imagination. It&#39;d be far too costly, and worse, you&#39;d have WAY less people to trade with after. We&#39;re not in a post-war time period yet, but the global capitalist system hasn&#39;t come even close to collapsing. Too much money would be lost and too many potential costumers would be dead.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand your point, but I wouldn’t rule it out. A faked world war could happen, and these nations could indeed go to war if the right things happened. Say, for example, if NK went off crazy and Russia and China were serious about no US involvement. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess that would depend on who NK went crazy on. Unfortunately if NK went nuts I&#39;d assume it was one of those two countries who egged them on - and neither country would be able to stop a retaliation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;The US has such little risk&quot;? </p>

<p>If it&#39;s endgame the US population is screwed like everybody else outside Dumbs. The east coast ports would be hit by nuclear torpedoes and at the top with large scale tsunamis by tectonic bombs.</p>

<p>I doubt the Hoover dam would survive either and the results won&#39;t be pretty. The same applies to the Yangtze damn in China. Then there&#39;s always the Yellowstone Caldera.</p>

<p>There&#39;s also the uncomfortable fact that no country with nuclear plants can survive such level of conflict. A few drone attacks here and the real panic starts even without flying nukes.</p>

<p>This whole notion of traditional invasion fleets is silly. What&#39;s the gain? After the infrastructures implode the remaining populations will fight itself for survival and if somebody is left who cares it&#39;s smarter to wait this out and take what&#39;s left.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am starting to think that there is a set of rules we dont see. There is something that is holding them back from simply just nuking us. Maybe they are aware of the karma system and that we must somehow be responsible for our own destruction. I do think we are on the edge of collapse but maybe somehow our will has not been broken and thus they cannot move forward until we give in and become more corrupt. </p>

<p>Just a theory.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hear me out. Edgar Mitchell who was a Apollo astronaut has made the claim of Supernatural forces that  prevented World War 3 in the 70s. </p>

<p>In the 60&#39;s the cuba missle crisis was down to a hair from being completely nuclear. </p>

<p>It seems like we have been so close to the edge of catastrophe, that maybe there is something else involved that has prevented it thus far? Don&#39;t know.

    <div class="md"><p>China really doesn&#39;t have the ability to deploy troops to the US yet, or really anywhere outside the Asia-Pacific. The US truly is the only global superpower at this point. Just from a logistics perspective, there&#39;s no way to get enough troops anywhere close to the mainland. </p>

<p>A war at this point would end horribly for China, especially if they were seen as the aggressor, and if they lost, they would almost certainly be seen as the aggressor. They&#39;re pursuing a much more subtle and effective strategy, using economic and soft diplomatic power to acquire vassal states in  the Pacific and Africa, biding their time until the US eventually collapses economically, which will almost certainly happen. </p>

<p>If you&#39;re interested in the parallels with the period preceding WWI, James Corbett has an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6dOPMgdjLo">excellent talk</a> on the topic. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think China will have superseded the US economically by then unless something major happens, and I don&#39;t even want to speculate what form that might take. There&#39;s one line of thinking that Chinese leadership is under the control of or part of the same ruling cabal as the US, and that the ascension of China is part of the larger plan. Another line of thinking is that they are not, in which case, I think we can expect the US/UK/EU axis to try something, potentially something drastic, to prevent China&#39;s ascension. </p>
