    <div class="md"><p>When someone posts an AMA they have to prove who they are, which he did. Why is it meaningless in your opinion? And I’m sure you know which video I’m talking about we’ve all seen it by now. People screaming, bodies on the floor as they walk in the hallway. </p>

<p>Do you believe any of these recent shootings actually happen or are they all hoaxed? Do you not believe anything happens just because you can’t walk over or drive to it to see it? Here’s my thing, i don’t live by that town that this shooting happened and I’m assuming you don’t either. if I was you, this person who genuinely thinks all these mass shootings are being faked, that would be such a big deal to me that I’d spend the couple hundred bucks in a plane ticket and go to Florida for myself, see the school, see the police, the victims mourning at the vigil service.  </p>

<p>Believing in conspiracies is one thing, disagreeing with every single things you can despite seeing plenty of evidence is another. I bet if there wasn’t any mass shooting for a year or 2 you’d be posting that there’s shootings going on and now they’re covering it for whatever reason. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here is what I see in that video: jerky, blurry videos (especailly in second half) show undetermined forms laying on floor. One is conveniently laid behind a podium, with only legs showing. Lots of backs of people’s heads and view blockaage. Then we see the standard blurred jerky filming of the floor on the way out. Who has a camera like this in 2018? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You’re right it’s blurry, seems the same quality of random fb live videos/snaps I see of my friends recording at the club/parties etc. I don’t know what phone this person was using to record this.  “Undetermined forms” I saw legs and arms and torsos so with that I was able to interpret as being a person, I guess you couldn’t and that’s fair. Taking the video in as a whole  it is safe to say that a shooting was happening and people had been shot. Obviously some people aren’t able to deduct that and that’s fine.  For myself i understand the jerky motions were probaly because the cameraman was getting shot at. And the standard blurred jerky filming was probaly due to running for your life to safety and trying not to die. </p>

<p>I remember in my high school they had security cameras in the hallways, I’m assuming this one does also so maybe they will put out that footage and it’ll make it easier for you to see what’s going on. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Somebody with the technology should do an analysis of these videos for fakery. This would include previous events. I am amazed that hasn&#39;t been done. The imagery doesn&#39;t look like modern device camera images. For comparison this is a test of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qeht7JLr4aQ">Iphone 5S from 2013.</a> It is far, far superior to the distorted view in the video Capn Salt posted- good-quality, nicely focused images with a stabilization feature.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So far I&#39;ve only watched the first few seconds of that video but I already see similarities to videos of other staged events. They are <em>always</em> filmed in the vertical aspect which I believe to be a means of excluding unwanted detail from the periphery. The less they show, the less we can find fault with. And also, the usual &quot;oh shit oh shit oh my god oh my god.&quot; You know, the stuff you would definitely say if you were trying to fake such an intensely horrifying situation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Like with Vegas there seems to be a lot of kids who you would think all have their phones out filming, because we know that teenagers have no self awareness of personal danger. And yet again, we have one or two flip phone angles that seem very sketchy at best. It&#39;s not that I need to see blood guts and gore but there is a definite sense of fakery about it.

    <div class="md"><p>Glad you actually checked out the ama. Obviously all schools are different but when I was in high school I didn’t take my geometry class in 9th grade like I was supposed to bc I decided to take a 3rd elective instead. I never tried to make up for it until my senior year when I needed it to graduate so I was in a class with all freshmen, and a few juniors and other seniors who had failed the class. It could be something as simple as this. Most classes are made up of 80% of the grade that’s supposed to be there and then a few stragglers who failed or need the credit. It won’t be 100% freshmen or another grade in a class, especially electives like woodshop or whatever else. </p>

<p>Honestly I can’t believe anyone took the time to record at all but you see that with the culture now. Everytime there’s a fight or something happening people record it’s instinct now. The fact he used an emoji in his snap is not enough reason for me to not believe this video is real. Also in the top right you see dust falling from the ceiling as he was firing, probaly where the bullets were hitting. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yup, math science english and social studies are all core credits. You fail or skip out on one of them early on, you’ll have to make up for it to graduate. There’s a lot of different classes you could take for social studies to get credits and holocaust history was obviously an option at that school. I feel anyone who was in high school the last decade will see this is  common. </p>

<p>Personally, I definitely see a lot of these events have a lot of details that are questionable and I feel like we never get the full story on what and why and how and that is frustrating. But lately I’ve seen people who immediately assume every single event like this is fake, which to me is just as close minded as believing in every single thing. At the end neither of these types of people will use reason and nobody can show them otherwise. </p>

<p>Almost everything that happens in the world we aren’t there to witness personally for obvious reasons. There’s a superbowl every year, just like there’s mass shootings, with national media coverage, names, actual geographic locations, witnesses, key people who are alive and you can look up with social media, so even though I’ve never been to a Super Bowl, based on all these things I know that it’s real and it happens. </p>

<p>Obviously there’s a lot of different reasons people think there is to fake a shooting, like putting fear in people, gun control etc but the thing is there is already plenty of violence that a little more wouldn’t weigh the scale, and hasn’t. People kill eachother everyday. There’s crime everyday. I’ve seen people on the local news that I knew that were killed. I didn’t see them die, but knowing them and their group of friends and going to the funeral it was safe to believe they were dead. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe that most of these events involve fakery and serious deception. Fakes have a certain wash, rinse, repeat pattern to them that you need to educate yourself to. There may be some that are hybrid where some targeted indivduals are taken out, but those are small numbers compared to the casualty claims. That may have happened at Las Vegas. </p>

<p>Actually few people see these as our right fakes. The doubters call them real false flags, with real carnage. There is some kind of mental block to them being fake. Even truthers who I otherwise respect fall for it. </p>

<p>The reason staged deceptions are preferred — meaning not involving real deaths or a limited number of deaths — is primarily because real victims or their survivors go off the rails and can’t be controlled. Real false flags get very messy, whereas staged deceptions can be directed and manipulated.</p>

<p>Plus, owning the victimhood franchise, or “victim stance,” is extremely effective and valuable both for four reasons: 1) beating back those who question the anomalies (the one-trick-pony, “you’re crazy” accusation); 2) maximizing charity frauds and government-fund loots; 3) demonizing target groups or peoples; and 4) forcing problem-reaction-solution control agendas. One of the latest is “control of the internet” and &quot;preemptive mental health/pre-crime&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Curious to me that atop the front page of this subreddit right now is a post that seems to imply that Parkland was a false flag but definitely not a hoax. </p>

<p>Why not sticky it to the top? Have it there so people can use it to stave off any rumors of a &quot;hoax.&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In many cases there is the &quot;official&quot; conspiracy theory, which is planted too, and still not the truth. </p>

<p>For example, 911:</p>

<p>Level 0 (MSM nonsense): bearded acrobatic pilots throw passports outside of cabin windows and pulverize 3 steel skyscrapers with 2 aluminum planes.</p>

<p>Level 1 (official conspiracy theory): aluminum planes enter steel skyscraper like a hot knife through butter, and then (nano-)thermite used to demolish buildings. False flag.</p>

<p>Level 2 (truth): no airplanes. Nuclear demolition. Occult ritualistic mass-sacrifice and psyop.</p>

<p>The &quot;offcial&quot; conspiracy theory will be generally well received.mTry and formulate something that approaches the truth, and see the astroturfing commence. This OP is a sign of that; you ask a valid question, yet the thread stands at 40%.</p>

<p>On this Parkland event, it is clear to me they are <em>expecting</em> people to question the narrative. See <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7xmqt4/parkland_shooting_swat_team_drills/du9leqp/">this</a>. Notice how my comment was downvoted in that thread. Also this whole &quot;FBI did not investigate&quot;, drill nonsense/confusion, second shooter testimony, etc. - all of that is done on purpose.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very interesting. I have noticed that there are levels of conspiracy we are &quot;allowed&quot; to question. We are &quot;allowed&quot; with Vegas for example to spiral off into any speculation we wish about ISIS, Saudis, arms deals, multiple shooters....... but we aren&#39;t allowed to question whether there was a deadly shooting. </p>

<p>With 9/11 we are allowed to question nearly everything, but find ourselves sort of corralled into dwelling on building 7 or &quot;foreknowledge&quot; by the Bush administration. But anytime I mention no plane theory I am downvoted and ridiculed with the same scripted lines such as &quot;thousands of eyewitnesses.&quot;</p>

<p>Same with this situation. People are so quick to say it&#39;s a false flag but not a hoax. We can fly into speculation about pharmaceuticals and mental health, multiple shooters, and even concurrent drills. But as usual, we must not question the basic claims that children were shot. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are absolutely right. </p>

<p>I recommend Miles W Mathis&#39; papers, I&#39;m sure you will enjoy them.</p>

<p>See <a href="http://mileswmathis.com/rabin.pdf">this one about the assassination of Rabin</a> (pdf). It is interesting how he describes the &quot;official&quot; conspiracy theory, who it was intended for, wh it was done, etc. (a right-wing nut <em>isn&#39;t the actual killer</em>) versus the truth (<em>he wasn&#39;t actually killed</em>).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But why not just stage one clean and tight hoax in the first place? Why create a mainstream theory AND an alternative theory from the get-go? Because. . . it has been found that two or more stories cover a fake better than one.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the kind words. I think that&#39;s a really good question. I believe he first mentioned that <a href="http://mileswmathis.com/barindex2.pdf">in his paper on the hoaxed JFK assassination.</a> </p>

<p>There he basically says that it&#39;s important for them to make us believe the death was real. Doesn&#39;t matter which version of the story we buy into, as long as we buy into one where the event is taken for real. But he doesn&#39;t really elaborate on why. </p>

<p>Here are my two cents on this question:</p>

<p>Basically they are trying to sell us one one of their fake narratives. In the case of JFK, the mainstream story is that Oswald was a communist. This sells us on the reality of communism, as if it was a legitimate and independent ideological movement. But that isn&#39;t true. Communism was a construct of worldwide Intelligence (at the control of Western bankers).  </p>

<p>The mainstream conspiracy theories sell us on the story that JFK had real enemies due to his actions (whether it be against the Fed or his lenient policies towards Russia or whatever). In other words, that there is a real contest over political power with &#39;good guys&#39; (JFK) and &#39;bad guys&#39; (fill-in-the-blank). But in reality JFK was playing a part. It&#39;s like one huge stage play, and the media is totally complicit in creating a Matrix-like reality. That&#39;s the truth they don&#39;t want us to uncover, and that&#39;s why they push conspiracy theories that try to sell us on another narrative they&#39;re trying to sell us about how the world works. </p>

<p>In the Rabin case, it&#39;s sort of the same thing. They are selling us on the idea that Rabin was some kind of hero or at least some kind of enemy to some real force in the world. But he was a lifetime actor just like JFK. Plus, both the accepted story and the mainstream conspiracy narratives serve to further the divide and conquer strategy by pushing people apart. </p>

<p>Does that help answer the question?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just like Waco, 911 Sandy Hook (another drill gone live), this school must be knocked down so no outside agencies can view the evidence, I mean, to protect the kids.</p>

<p>You would think by now, people would actually start to pay attention. This was a planned live shooter drill, same as Sandy Hook, multiple people and news articles confirm this. One article (I linked to earlier) in the daily beast even stated that the shooter used the MASS SHOOTER DRILL as cover. Not a very good plan but that is the story.</p>

<p>And for all those that think &quot;it&#39;s too big for so many people to keep it quiet&quot;, well as I stated after Vegas, only a few people at the top need to know. The cops on the ground, the kids etc, they go on with the event as if it real.</p>

<p>Call me whatever names you like, but when drills magically go live and then the evidence must be immediately destroyed, I get a bit suspicious.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes absolutely it is an extraordinary claim. To date there is zero evidence that you put on your own pants. I believe you at least have (((help))) zipping them up which is why audio evidence along with 1080p 60fps video (multiple angles are encouraged) is required to refute.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It seems to me the only way you’d believe anything happened is if you were physically there yourself. </p>

<p>Since you weren’t there, and I wasn’t either, I posted a link to the ama of somebody who was there. You also failed to back up your opinion on why ama’s are meaningless by the way. But like you said it’s not about you it’s about evidence posted on the thread, here it is. </p>
