<p>Fox: &quot;We don&#39;t do that now? We don&#39;t mess around in other people&#39;s elections?&quot;</p>

<p>CIA: &quot;Weeell num. num.num.num.num.num, ha ha ha ha. guffaw, only for a very good cause in the interests of democracy&quot;</p>

<p>Questions:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>what &quot;system&quot;</strong> does the CIA seek to  benefit when it meddles in other people&#39;s elections?</p></li>
<li><p>What kind of logic enables the to CIA think <strong>&quot;messing around&quot; in &quot;other people&#39;s elections&quot; benefits democracy?</strong></p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>I come from a small island in the Caribbean. The US supported a guy who ended up being a dictator for 30 years, directly and by proxy through his family. The CIA then aided the locals in plotting, financing and arming for his assassination. The ensuing elections got a guy elected that had a “for the people” type campaign (early 60s, height of the Cold War), he was, of course, deemed by the US to be too dangerously close to communist rhetoric and had a US military intervention (it was really an invasion). Most of the people wanted that guy in power, the US did not. After they successfully completed the coupe, they helped “monitor” new elections and guess who won? The young right hand of the first guy that stayed for 30 years and they helped assassinate. This new guy ruled in a similar way, having a secret police torture and kill critics and especially scholars and journalists. He ruled for another 16 years or so and favored the US with imports and exports, basically “yes sir”ing everything they said. </p>

<p>I&#39;m disgusted, to be honest, by all the fake naivety of the crowd running around crying and moaning about &#39;Russia was trying to interfere in our election!&#39;</p>

<p>As if they haven&#39;t tried to influence every single election we&#39;ve had since world war II and probably before.  And yes, as if the good ol cowboys from the Ewue ess aye haven&#39;t plunged numerous countries into actual civil way to further very dubious goals.</p>

<p>Of course the goddamned Russians tried to influence our elections.  Them and every other country that has the means to try it.</p>

Let&#39;s say Pakistan hacked Trumps emails and set up troll farms to push bullshit about Trump online and try to hack into our voter data bases. Then Hillary ends up winning. The country says woah, we shouldn&#39;t let Pakistan influence our election process. You&#39;d be sitting here defending them?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lets get back to Russian Dossiers.</p>

<p>So if Trump had been the outgoing president in control of the justice department at the time and really wanted Pence to win the presidential election...he could have gotten warrants to spy on the Democrat Candidate&#39;s campaign by lying to the Judges inthe secret court and presenting false evidence that he purchased from let&#39;s say...Hmmmm...North Korea maybe?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So I guess you&#39;ll completely ignore what I asked you. Obama didn&#39;t get warrants to spy on Carter Page. The FBI decided to renew a warrant on Carter Page because Trump stacked his campaign full of criminals working on behalf of Russian interests. What false evidence?

<p>The director of the CIA actually met with an official who was investigating the matter and claims it was an inside job.  Glad he isn&#39;t as dismissive as you are!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course we meddle in other&#39;s elections, prop up one dictator to keep another out of power, arm insurgents to remove a government that is not friendly to us, and HOPEFULLY it is done for good reasons.  </p>

<p>This is exactly why I don&#39;t understand the current faux outrage and surprise that Russians bought facebook ads or stole voter information.  We needed a special prosecutor to figure that out?  It&#39;s almost like those voicing outrage are just stirring the pot for their own political reasons ... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What I don&#39;t get is why you&#39;re so concerned with this meddling in the form of memes and facebook ads.</p>

<p>Have you ever heard of Israel? It&#39;s this illegal country overseas. It more or less owns your political machine. Would you be interested in a special counsel to investigate that too?</p>

<p>All this Russia-fad is doing is showing that political meddling happens between nations all the time (and the US is one of the worst). If anyone was actually concerned about the foreign undermining of American democracy, they&#39;d actually be calling for investigations of all politicians&#39; ties to all foreign nationals and governments, this includes dual citizenship politicos.</p>

<p>But let&#39;s not worry about that. &quot;TV said hate trump and Russia and they are the same thing so I hate that thing.&quot;</p>

<p>All this Russia-fad</p>

<p>It&#39;s not a fad.  It&#39;s a militarized LARP attack with bots and people from Russia that is 24/7 now.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/19/technology/russian-bots-school-shooting.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/19/technology/russian-bots-school-shooting.html</a></p>

<p>“The bots focus on anything that is divisive for Americans. Almost systematically.”</p>

<p>One of the most divisive issues in the nation is how to handle guns, pitting Second Amendment advocates against proponents of gun control. And the messages from these automated accounts, or bots, were designed to widen the divide and make compromise even more difficult.</p>

<p>Any news event — no matter how tragic — has become fodder to spread inflammatory messages in what is believed to be a far-reaching Russian disinformation campaign. The disinformation comes in various forms: conspiracy videos on YouTube, fake interest groups on Facebook, and armies of bot accounts that can hijack a topic or discussion on Twitter.</p>

<p>First, if the educational state of the American People is such that they can be brainwashed by a low-energy ad campaign, then Russia isn&#39;t the problem here.</p>
