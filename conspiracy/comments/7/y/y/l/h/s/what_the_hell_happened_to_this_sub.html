        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It&#39;s full of complete close minded fools as of late. Nothing is discussed openly and any one with the opinion even close to supporting a conspiracy theory (aka anti msm opinions) are down voted and have accounts take a diarrhea dump of their thoughts, suggestions, and opinions. What happened to friendly open discussion and debate? It&#39;s just a bunch of douchebags talking down to you and being over all passive aggressive assholes now. This is the conspiracy sub, why the fuck are we all arguing over who did what left said this right said that, Russia this, trump that  Hillary this, Bill that... Fucking give your head a shake people. This is a sub that should reject all politicians. The game is rigged, there is no white horse leader for America...current or in the future.. ..its over. The game is rigged and has been. I&#39;ve been going to this sub for years. If you have too, then you see what I&#39;m talking about. This sub really started to nose dive around the DNC leaks, Seth Rich, and most importantly.... The podesta emails in regards to &#39;pizzagate&#39;  it saddens me as a critical thinker that this sub is at its lowest point in its history.  Just rantin&#39;  feel free to down vote to oblivion or discuss using our brains.</p>

<p>Edit1*  just to note. I&#39;m writing this edit after only 30 seconds of it being live. In that time, someone down voted this post and we all know damn well they didn&#39;t read this in that time. Now THERE&#39;S a conspiracy :p</p>

<p>Edit2** well this took off didn&#39;t it.</p>

<p>Edit3***  I&#39;ll add that I&#39;m sure we all know of politicians that want to serve us well and have our best interest in mind. But and I will add -  in my opinion -  the system itself is a failure. So no matter who runs, it won&#39;t matter. The game is rigged.</p>

<p>Edit4**** last one for tonight as I&#39;m south for vacation and I wrote this at the pool killing time waiting for drinks. The wife hates when I get on here rambling. Maybe she&#39;s actually Russian.
Thanks for the gold too. And apologies if this same topic is beat to death here every week. I&#39;ll apologize again since I&#39;m Canadian. Night all! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What happened is that a lot of people want this to be an echo chamber for their half assed &quot;investigations&quot; or &quot;discussions&quot; which usually just twine-balls of incorrect facts, hearsay, interpretation, etc - they want a place they can engage in fantasy play about their pet theories with people who aren&#39;t going to challenge them.</p>

<p>Often times the rest of reddit/the net will ignore these little spaces but sometimes we notice noxious smells or fumes coming from them and we have to come in and see what&#39;s going on.</p>

<p>Remember when that guy went into a pizza place with a gun because he spent too much time reading BS on the internet? Yea, that&#39;s what got the sub shut down...it was turning into this insane schizo witch hunt.</p>

<p>Of course pedophiles exist, of course they talk to and help eachother, and of course some of them have power. The &quot;pizzagate&quot; thing overall though is just a bunch of misinterpretation, cherry picking, and seeing jesus&#39;s face in toast.</p>

<p>When people come in and ask questions and press for evidence and point out that there are more possible explanations than the ones being put forward -better ones - then a lot of people complain and start throwing &quot;shill&quot; around.</p>

<p>If this is supposed to be an open discussion and debate you should be open to hearing alternate opinions.</p>

<p>Case in point - Seth Rich. It&#39;s a fact that random murders/botched robberies happen. We also don&#39;t know all the details of what happened. There&#39;s no reason Seth Rich couldn&#39;t be a perfectly mundane murder, the fact that so many people act as if it HAS to be something sinister demonstrates that they aren&#39;t working based on evidence &amp; rationality but are engaging in motivated reasoning.</p>

<p>There&#39;s also the fact that Seth Rich couldn&#39;t have been the only leaker...and there&#39;s a ton of evidence that the DNC was hacked by hackers of russian origin or alignment. Pretty much everyone, including the russians when they&#39;re being honest, agrees that they engage in these sorts of campaigns.</p>

<p>The seth rich leaking thing doesn&#39;t make sense, and if we&#39;re gonna go down that road you also have to take time to consider the possibility that seth rich&#39;s murder was part of a russian plot to cover their tracks - to create a fall guy.</p>

<p>It&#39;s never made sense to think he was the leaker, the main evidence is julian assange sort of implying it (though not even that really, just letting people believe it) and it&#39;s been proven again and again that he has no problem lying or implying things are true if it suits him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll touch base on the pizzagate stuff - Wasn&#39;t the pizzagate sub shut down well before that story of the dude with a dun at a comet ping pong? There was overwhelming cirmustantial evidence to support pizzagate. Not that there were kids in the basement of the joint, but it seemed to scratch the surface of something that appeared to be much much bigger. Cirmustantial evidence is not hard 100% proof, no, but you have enough of it, it should Atleast warrent questioning and investigating, not immediately thrown to the curb as nonsense. Don&#39;t you think?</p>

<p>As for the Seth Rich stuff, you are not wrong. Assange implying or we taking facial movements as fact is not right. Also, it being a conspiracy sub, you&#39;re right, the idea of Russia involvement with SR opposed to the DNC shouldn&#39;t be thrown to the side either. No one really knows what happened to SR. But the timing of his murder and the leaks are odd. People also think that ol&#39; trump started the Fake news push when it was actually the msm literally exactly after that weekend of the DNC Leaks and the Podesta emails. Trump calling cnn fake news during that conference started pushing &#39;fake news&#39; talk everywhere. Timing is always important to note.  Does it make it fact? No. But does raise the question &#39;why then?&#39; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re right that circumstantial evidence can warrant further investigation.</p>

<p>Is it really &quot;overwhelming circumstantial evidence&quot; though?</p>

<p>It&#39;s not just about the type and amount, it&#39;s about HOW it was collected. Circumstantial evidence has to be analyzed in a context of what we can and do know in order to be meaningful.</p>

<p>It&#39;s important to conduct investigations in a certain way. You start by establishing certain facts, then you follow threads, develop ideas, test them, keep collecting info...etc.</p>

<p>What a lot of pizzagaters do though is they just anomaly hunt. They just dig through a pile of info of dubious quality and collect everything they think is &quot;weird&quot;. They usually don&#39;t bother seriously trying other theories besides the pet one they have. They also discard anything that doesn&#39;t fit.</p>

<p>So what you end up with at the end is a big dump of &quot;evidence&quot; pasted together in MS paint where it&#39;s dubious as to whether it&#39;s even true and there&#39;s no actual analysis.</p>

<p>Most of the &quot;evidence&quot; I&#39;ve seen of pizzagate is easily just lack of imagination or ignorance on the &quot;researchers&quot; part.</p>

<p>Stuff like &quot;oh they called children &#39;entertainment&#39; in this email NOBODY would do that, PIZZAGATE PIZZAGATE&quot;</p>

<p>Except I&#39;ve hear adults use the type of language in the emails tons of times. Most pizzagaters are young males so I guess it&#39;s hard for them to imagine, but a lot of people genuinely like being around kids in a totally innocent way. They find them entertaining and they enjoy the idea of nurturing the next generation.</p>

<p>Pizzagate will forever be tainted by the fact that there&#39;s so many people in it that will go &quot;I found this one strange phrase in an email and even though I didn&#39;t really try I can&#39;t think of ANY explanation except pedos therefore it&#39;s pedos&quot;</p>

<p>That&#39;s why it&#39;s a bit funny to hear some people complain about the &quot;debunkers&quot;...if you actually care about uncovering &quot;the truth&quot; and &quot;beating THEM&quot; then you&#39;d want to eliminate the bad actors and idiots from your own team.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This sub has always been as &#39;anti establishment&#39; as it gets. People who think of themselves as such are drawn here. Trump very much <em>portrayed</em> himself as anti establishment, and his supporters believe him. So they flock here, where they feel they belong, but it shifts the political makeup of the sub, and now you have a bunch of people who think the president and his people are fighting the good fight against all those other terrible people in government.</p>

<p>Aaand obviously that also means that anyone who wants to do some astroturfing sees that this place is A) full of Trump supporters, and B) full of anti-establishment people, many of whom flocked to Trump in 2016, and so should be ripe for the picking.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is because your fellow humans have sold out having not developed any useful real world skills so they get paid to incite, discredit and gaslight you and everyone else in this sub. </p>

<p>I recognized this a few years ago and I no longer (besides this) comment anymore. Nobody is interested in real truth here. My suggestion would be wherever the most hate, the most ridiculed topics are those ones typically where the most truth lies. </p>

<p>Flat earth for example, I have measured across 46 miles of open water and about 100 miles over land and it is measurably flat and level yet it will be ridiculed and downvoted. Everything in the Bible and the book of Enoch is true. The biggest conspiracy of all is the hiding of God. The devil’s greatest trick...</p>

<p>Pure evil exists and has generationally for thousands of years. The serpent seed has only expanded over time and has deceived everyone about almost everything. </p>

<p>I highly suggest getting your information from the Bible as it is the only truth in a world full of lies. We have been overcome with Satan and his army. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never understood how that works. Are shill companies approaching redditors and purchasing their accounts or is someone within reddit handing over inactive accounts to shill companies?

<p>How strange would it be to come back to reddit after a long break to find your account has been used for shilling, right?</p>

<p>Sounds like you can get an account for $2. But a high karma one might fetch $100-$200.</p>

<p>If someone offered me $100 for this account I would probably take it.</p>

<p>I also saw a few sketchy looking websites in my quick google search that say they pay for accounts. </p>

<p>The problem is r/the_donald and strictly anti-Hillary people refuse to come to terms that Donald Trump is arguably worse (and let me say this since so many of you love him, he&#39;s just as equally bad--is that fair?) than Trump.</p>

<p>Instead of showing that you really care about justice and fairness, as were the claims during Hillary&#39;s Benghazi/emails, etc, those same people are refusing to acknowledge all the shit Trump is caught up in.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s the thing, I&#39;m a very <strong>very</strong> anti-Hillary person. I&#39;m also a very <strong>very</strong> anti-Trump. I find myself more at odds with the Hillary supporters though because for all the talk about how bad Trump supporters are, I see an incredible number of Hillary supporters acting worse. I see them far more than I see Trump supporters. That wouldn&#39;t even be a big deal if it weren&#39;t accompanied by them talking non-stop about Trump circle jerks and how Reddit hates minorities and women. Reddit is by and large a very liberal place. As a centerist who leans slightly more left than right, it would even work for me. But the constant act as if they are under attack for seeing an opinion that differs is infuriating. Then you glance at the votes, and they are upvoted while dissenting opinions are downvoted into oblivion. There is basically a demand for confirmation bias, and an almost total lack of self awareness politically, and while neither side is immune or remotely free of it, the left here on Reddit seems to really be championing that cause. </p>

<p>The hope would be that we could understand that political affiliations ultimately don&#39;t matter in a sub like this. People should understand that neither their nor the opposition&#39;s party is good or trustworthy, but instead we get a constant cycle of both attacking the other side while defending something that is ultimately indefensible. It almost seems that we are at a saturation point with partisanship.</p>

<p>This is of course good advice, but some people have taken this to the point of &quot;always believe the opposite of whatever the mainstream media says.&quot;  I imagine that before Trump, the people on this sub would be all over a possible conspiracy involving the president colluding with Russia.  That is A grade conspiracy fodder.  But now that such a thing is suggested by the mainstream media, the &quot;conspiracy&quot; thing to do in some people&#39;s minds it to deny it is even possible.  And in addition to these people you have those who have bought into the Trump personality cult for whom &quot;truth&quot; merely connotes &quot;that which benefits the leader.&quot;  Both of these groups of people are not debating with an honest interest in finding truth (I use the word &quot;truth&quot; here to mean that which corresponds with reality).  </p>

<p>World leaders manufacture disputes and cooperation, it&#39;s all about instilling the idea they are important and working for us. They might aswell all be video game characters.</p>

<p>However most long time conspiracy buffs  would agree that an argument with a casual user is a waste of time.

    <div class="md"><p>We should start looking into ways to prevent this sub from going off track too often. Shills not only try to reinforce mainstream narratives, they probably also post dumb theories to get us distracted and going down the wrong path. The more bullshit they post, the more dilute the sub becomes and the more difficult it is to obtain useful information. </p>

<p>I think there should be a periodic reminder that <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/70qvx7/updated_list_of_proven_conspiracies_and_hidden/">there have been a great deal of proven conspiracies</a>, some of them being international in scope, and involving large groups of people who got away with it for many years. This completely wipes out several of their main narratives, including the claim that the government must be too incompetent to pull off large conspiracies. </p>

<p>Periodically focusing on conspiracy facts, rather than theories, especially when many of the proven ones are very similar to current unproven theories, would do a lot of good here. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why do people have to fall into one of the two parties? I mean, for fuck&#39;s sake, this is a conspiracy subreddit. I kinda would rather see people not blindly follow either side on here. There are political subreddits for that. And I encourage you to visit them and compartmentalize yourself on those, if you feel so inclined. But when on a conspiracy subreddit it seems best to try to keep an open mind. If the post doesn&#39;t align with your worldview, then you just move to the next post. Ultimately upvotes and discussion should win. I kinda wish downvotes were disabled on this subreddit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I won&#39;t reject the notion of Russian trolls but it has absolutely been Hillary&#39;s camp that has been most influential on Reddit. I&#39;ll never forget the day after Sanders lost the primary the complete 180 this entire website made and never looked back. It&#39;s one big propoganda network and has been for more than a year now.</p>

<p>The extent to which Russia has influenced Reddit&#39;s atmosphere I cannot know, and Hillary&#39;s camp&#39;s (for lack of a better identifier) motivations I can only guess at, but it seems clear to me that reddit has not offered an organic user experience on many of the controversial subs for quite a while.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean....as someone who went from supporting Sanders to Clinton I can pretty easily explain it.<br/>
It was Sanders v Clinton.  I purposely avoided ever talking negatively about her in case she won but others didn&#39;t--we wanted Sanders to win so talking negatively about the competition is going to happen.<br/>
Then Sanders lost.  So she was the democratic nominee which made it Clinton v Trump.  Me and many others may have preferred Sanders...but we greatly preferred Clinton to Trump.  So, yeah, people changed over.  But it&#39;s not nearly as stark as you&#39;re saying.<br/>
The Sanders sub was still going on even well after all hope was lost.  There were jokes around reddit about &#39;so you&#39;re saying there&#39;s a chance&#39; about people still holding out hope for him to miraculously (impossibly) get the nom.<br/>
And, then, some people still held on to the Clinton hate and continued--some went third party or even over to Trump.<br/>
So, as someone who as pretty deep into that stuff...it wasn&#39;t as big a 180 as you make it out to be but, even the change that did happen, is completely understandable.                </p>

<p>To a lot of these people it went Sanders &gt;&gt; Clinton &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Trump<br/>
So the &#39;180&#39; makes perfect sense.         </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think I can clear it up for you. </p>

<p>When this sub first started a &quot;shill&quot; was anyone pushing against a conspiracy being discussed. They usually had relatively new accounts, or older accounts with no history of participating on r/conspiracy. These older accounts were most likely purchased so as to give the appearance of legitimacy.</p>

<p>Post-election, a &quot;shill&quot; is anyone that disagrees with a perceived political opinion expressed by the OP.</p>

<p>Hope I helped. </p>

<p>There are almost certainly <em>are</em> shills here; probably ones on both sides of the political spectrum, and possibly even ones designed to look stupid and discredit conspiracy theorists altogether. But if you could identify them individually, it would mean they weren&#39;t doing their job right.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I recommend reading the paper by Cass R Sunstein (friend and adviser to Obama) and Adrian Vermeule  &quot;Conspiracy Theories&quot;,  to see some of the tactics that appear to be used by potential shills on conspiracy &quot;social networks&quot;, and the reasons why they think they&#39;re effective.</p>

&quot;Abstract
Many millions of people hold conspiracy theories; they believe that powerful people have worked together in order to withhold the truth about some important practice or some terrible event. A recent example is the belief, widespread in some parts of the world, that the attacks of 9/11 were carried out not by Al Qaeda, but by Israel or the United States. Those who subscribe to conspiracy theories may create serious risks, including risks of violence, and the existence of such theories raises significant challenges for policy and law. The first challenge is to understand the mechanisms by which conspiracy theories prosper; the second challenge is to understand how such theories might be undermined. Such theories typically spread as a result of identifiable cognitive blunders, operating in conjunction with informational and reputational influences. A distinctive feature of conspiracy theories is their self-sealing quality. Conspiracy theorists are not likely to be persuaded by an attempt to dispel their theories; they may even characterize that very attempt as further proof of the conspiracy. Because those who hold conspiracy theories typically suffer from a crippled epistemology, in accordance with which it is rational to hold such theories, the best response consists in cognitive infiltration of extremist groups. Various policy dilemmas, such as the question whether it is better for government to rebut conspiracy theories or to ignore them, are explored in this light.&quot;</p>

<p>Excerpts of note:
&quot;...the best response consists in cognitive infiltration... &quot;, &quot;Keywords: conspiracy theories, social networks, informational cascades, group polarization&quot; &quot;We have suggested, however, that government can minimize this effect by rebutting more
rather than fewer theories, by enlisting independent groups to supply rebuttals, and by cognitive infiltration designed to break up the crippled epistemology of conspiracy minded groups and informationally isolated social networks&quot;.</p>

<p>As with any conspiracy or conspiracy community, you have to dig to find real discussion. We&#39;ve all sorted through a ton of shit to even consider ourselves a part of this community. I personally don&#39;t see why we shouldn&#39;t have to dig through shit for the foreseeable future. It is the name of the game.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look, after re-reading my reply I can see how it <em>might</em> come across as a passive-aggresive response. I hope this reply clarifies my point:</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying your submission is misplaced, because there sure is a ton of undiscussable topics for many users. I think, like you, that there are many posts or threads where honest discussion is impossible so many users don&#39;t even attempt it. I can certainly tell  when my replies are just wasted effort when engaging with some people so I won&#39;t make that reply. </p>

<p>Common trust is what we must share in order to have good discussions, and it is missing on a grand scale here. It is not gone completely, but it is getting more difficult to find. </p>

<p>When I do engage in discussion, or debate, I try to do it with common decency and a request for reciprocity. It&#39;s not always that way, but the best conspiracy minded discussions will follow this guideline. As always, this is just my opinion.</p>

<p>No one wins an argument or changes another&#39;s mind with indecency, so I figure what&#39;s the point in engaging with those tactics?</p>

<p>Seek out those that operate with an open-mind and common decency, ignore the rest when you can. This isn&#39;t a subreddit for the faint of heart or sensitive minded. There IS a lot of shit to sift, but I&#39;ve always felt good when I find the hidden gems.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I suspect it&#39;s rather more sophisticated than that.  You have a botnet that monitors /new and compares it to a list.  If it&#39;s not on the list they want today, it&#39;s automatically given a certain number of downvotes.  If it contains certain keywords, it&#39;s downvoted harder.  If it&#39;s on their list of topics they want to work on, it is upvoted and then given a bunch of comments.  The shill accounts all upvote each other.  They have a certain narrative to present.  Anything that goes against it is both manually downvoted, and presented to a botnet to mass-downvote.  A few uneducated people will write actual comments that fit with the narrative, and they are mass-upvoted, so this encourages them to do that more because of the endorphin release.  They are training people to fit the mass narrative and only comment things that the botnet wants to hear.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not really. Both of them are basically partisan versions of r/conspiracy right now repping their theories.</p>

<p>The major difference is that r/politics wants to appear very intelligent, because this need to be seen as smart is a huge draw for unintelligent people. </p>

<p>However, r/the_donald uses humor and memes to draw in people. Because t_d doesn&#39;t claim to speak for all of politics but only one side it is much more effective. </p>

<p>In the end J don&#39;t frequent either of them because they&#39;re both blatant propaganda, BUT only one of them is at least doing propaganda correctly in 2018 and that is the_donald because they are at least entertaining. </p>

<p>Like seriously r/politics is still talking about Russia? Talk about cringeworthy. Even my super liberal friends don&#39;t say shit about Russia anymore. </p>

<p>I get certain subs are nothing more than fanboy pages and I&#39;m okay with that. I know what I&#39;m getting when I click the sub.  I just feel like something like r/politics should be a little more balanced. I don&#39;t know how you do that. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s only shills and bots. I do think the bulk of users on Reddit in general are younger and probably lean more left. So I can wrap my head around that a little bit. I just think it&#39;s a disturbing trend where only one side&#39;s views are promoted and the other sides points are down voted and hidden. </p>

<p>Like I&#39;m a grown ass woman, internet points aren&#39;t something I care about, but I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever had the guts to object to something being said over there. I believe it would be thoroughly exhausting and somewhat disheartening to have to defend my opinions like I would be forced to do if I were to comment. I&#39;m not saying I shouldn&#39;t have to defend my stance. I think that shit is important. Just that I&#39;ve seen the barrage that takes place and even in a sub like this, where most cats are fairly open minded, it&#39;s been difficult when I&#39;ve said something that may trigger some with a particular leaning. I just hate it that we can&#39;t have like legit discussions about stuff these days. And again, I don&#39;t believe everyone is a shill. I think there some who are just incredibly loyal to their party. I think there are a few who are just ignorant of facts. And I believe that there are plenty who are just as aware as I am regarding a topic and we really do just come to two different takes. Those are the cats I long to talk to. Unfortunately it&#39;s becoming increasingly difficult to distinguish between who is who and what their motives are. There are in fact people spreading disinfo in this very sub. Ugh. Maybe you won&#39;t get what I&#39;m saying. If you know of a site we&#39;re legit political discussions can take place without one side railing on someone with a dissenting opinion let me know. I&#39;d love to be able to discuss shit in a place that wasn&#39;t an echo chamber. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I get what your saying, and agree. You&#39;ll be hard pressed to find a place online. Best bet would be to seek out discussions with individuals, not large groups.</p>

<p>It is kind of depressing seeing what online discussions have devolved into, and trying to seek out what&#39;s real and what&#39;s &quot;shill/bots&quot; pretty much makes everyone cynical as fuck. I guess welcome to the new internet? Everything is real or everything is fake, it all just depends on what sub your on.</p>

But yeah, I guess we just gotta weed through the muck. I do wish everyone was aware of these tactics, but I am and I guess it&#39;s somewhat my responsibility to educate those around me that not everything we see on the internet is how it appears. Again, I realize not everyone is a shill or are trying to shut down conversation, your a perfect example of that. Thanks!</p>

<p>Actually that is not a fact nor has it been quantified in any way shape or form.  That is a conclusion you arrived at, which is fine.

    <div class="md"><p>I never really understood this argument.  It&#39;s explicitly a pro-Trump sub.  They tell you right in the rules you will be banned if you say otherwise.  I don&#39;t post there but at least they are straightforward about it.  Now <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>, which is supposed to be for relatively neutral discussion of politics in general is often compared to T_D as the polar opposite when they shouldn&#39;t even be in the same category. All that sees the light of day there is Anti-Trump pieces, many without substance.  They don&#39;t outright ban you but they have the votes so strongly manipulated you can&#39;t effectively participate if your views don&#39;t align with the prescribed narrative.  Reddit&#39;s 10 minute penalty echo chamber rule is very discouraging.  </p>

They usually respond by claiming it&#39;s because the thread made it to <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a>, but we see anti Trump comments at the top of threads that aren&#39;t even the top post in this sub. </p>

<p>Then we can talk about anti-Trump submissions. These do really well in this sub, which I will prove below. Guess what the excuse is? people claim the submissions were upvoted so high because they were on <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a>. Oh really? How did the post make it to <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> in the first place if this sub is &quot;controlled by Trump supporters?&quot; </p>

<p>There are a lot more than this, but this is what I could dig up from a quick search. Notice you never see anyone claim &quot;this sub is a T_D circlejerk&quot; in any of the anti-Trump threads. They just pretend these threads don&#39;t exist and continue with the anti-<a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> propaganda, which is usually heavily upvoted in here for some reason. A lot of people in here hate this sub. </p>

<p>Pay close attention to the upvote percentages. </p>

<p>If you check the comments of supposedly &quot;pro-Trump&quot; posts, anti-Trump comments reign supreme. There&#39;s nothing really wrong with that, but the people claiming this sub is one giant pro-Trump conspiracy are deluding themselves. Some people try to claim all of this is explained because this or that post hit <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a>, but that&#39;s complete bullshit. Posts that don&#39;t hit <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> are also very anti-Trump in the comments. Anti-Trump posts also couldn&#39;t hit <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> in the first place if they weren&#39;t heavily upvoted in this sub before they reached <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a>. </p>

<p>To the people who claim anti-Trump comments can be explained because some threads in this sub make it to <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a>, I&#39;ll show you a thread that is below a 1000 with anti-Trump comments.

<p>Also just pay more attention to the upvotes/downvotes in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> threads from now on.  Pay attention to that  and the propaganda just doesn&#39;t make any sense anymore. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m starting to find it obvious that the whole &quot;calm before the storm&quot; conspiracy theory is true. Patriots have secretly planned to avenge the murder of JFK by exposing and dismantling the cabal which ordered his assassination. This international criminal organization is the architect for what we now call the Deep State. The treasonous criminals involved know that they could legitimately face military tribunals and execution, and their propaganda efforts are becoming increasingly desperate in response.  </p>

<p>We have hundreds of people here daily talking about how Russian collusion would be the biggest conspiracy EVER, which is laughable to anyone who knows anything about the history of CIA meddling in foreign elections, and yet these people are often upvoted to the stratosphere. Meanwhile, the counter-coup conspiracy theory is downvoted to oblivion and/or laughed at even though it ties into the core conspiracy theory that has been discussed here since the subreddit began.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Since we&#39;re basically just using this post to complain, as a long time lurker of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, I&#39;m upset that no one here sees to seriously consider Trump/Russia as a conspiracy worthy of discussion. Like, if true, this would be one of the biggest conspiracies to have ever existed! How is that not absolute conspiracy nerd cat nip for anyone else!? </p>

<p>I&#39;ll fully admit my passion for this sub ebbs and flows, I&#39;ll be active for days in a row and then completely forget it exists for months. Back when the investigation started, I popped in here hoping to see some lively discussion and back and forth and there was fucking <em>nothing</em>. It took me awhile before I found some specific subs for the Russia investigation, but frankly those are boring as fuck because there&#39;s very little dissent. I want to hear from both sides! Even if it makes me angry! That&#39;s why I still visit The Drudge Report almost every day, despite my own personal political affiliations.</p>

<p>Why can&#39;t we live up to what many of us claim to want; to have semi-serious discussions about popular theories? Why aren&#39;t there like, weekly mega-threads on the top pop-conspiracies of the moment, with actual moderation to keep things on topic? </p>

<p>Have a pizzagate thread where I can read people&#39;s crazy 4chan posts and be devil&#39;s advocate of how a sentence in an email might really just be talking about getting some pizza without us calling each other shills. Have a Russiagate thread where you can point out the reasons I should be skeptical of the sourcing of a new &quot;bombshell&quot; report.</p>

<p>Instead, we settle for bot spamming the latest left/right flame up while mods act like dicks and throw any thread that isn&#39;t going the way they want into &quot;contest mode&quot; to stifle discussion. I wish there was some way to do a &quot;consitutional convention&quot; style re-boot of a sub. This place could be so much better if we started actually enforcing expectations on each other and cut out all of the hyper-partisan shit (shit of which I am guilty of myself).</p>

<p>It&#39;s almost hard to discuss because most of the major points aren&#39;t really being contended. Does anybody think Russia <em>didn&#39;t</em> try to leverage social media to sway voters?</p>

<p>I mean, why wouldn&#39;t they? It&#39;s hard to believe that Russia was like, &quot;Hmmmmm I bet we could -- for a pittance -- influence the U.S. election in favor of a candidate that promises to be friendly to Russia <em>and</em> will sow the most internal discord in the U.S.... but let&#39;s <em>not</em> do that.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the MSM approach of painting everything Trump does as EXPLOSIVE BOMBSHELLS that are going to destroy him has helped create the split. It’s a boy who cried wolf kind of situation. </p>

<p>Here in Australia since your goddamn elections there is at least one story a day about the latest thing trump has done - I don’t give a shit about his tweets but the media makes a huge deal out of it every time. There was a story on a news website here about the truth behind his hair that was on their front page for two fucking days, so it’s pretty easy to accept that the media is biased against him. Then when something comes out like Russian collusion, I’m automatically thinking oh another one of their stories. </p>

<p>This also creates a kind of situation where if you push the Russian thing then you’re on the side of the MSM, but if you deny it then your a tool of the government. It’s a no win for everyone</p>

<p>Edit: what I mean about the media here is that if it’s that bad here, I can’t even imagine what it’d be like over there</p>

<p>As someone who has been paying rapt attention to this thing as it has played out, I disagree with your basic assertions, but we have nowhere to hash out those differences aside from illusory posts that will effectively vanish into the ether within a day. What&#39;s the point in going in to details in that kind of environment? </p>

<p>If I asked you, I&#39;d hope you have more information to expand on your reasons for your beliefs, as I do my own. But, neither of us is going to make the effort to do that because we&#39;re effectively starting from zero with each interaction. That&#39;s way too much effort just to have a meaningful discussion with a single person. </p>

<p>Group those discussions up in a rolling megathread, and we at least have a chance at those discussions. You&#39;d start to recognize other people in the thread and have a basis of understanding to interact with each other and talk to one another.</p>

<p>Having contacts?</p>

<p>Well your beliefs are not based in reality. This whole Russia-Trump thing didn&#39;t come to light until after the election was over. It was dreamed up by the DNS. Muller already indited 13 Russians. I&#39;m still waiting 1+ year now to see where this Trump-Russia link is.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t give two shits about Putin, Trump, Hillary, Obama or any other one of these fuckers but I see no reason we need to have high tensions with Russia because as far as I can tell, the people of Russia like us, like our stuff, like our way of life and are not our enemies.

<p>Devil&#39;s Advocate:</p>

<p>John ordered pizza the last time they were all at the house in question (note: realtor found...). Someone else offered to pick up the pizza, but didn&#39;t know where the pizza place was. John sketched a basic map with an end goal of &quot;____ Pizza.&quot; Email sender (knowing that John ordered the pizza and someone else got it) speculates that perhaps John wrote the map on the handkerchief, and it might belong to John. </p>

<p><em>alternate theory</em></p>

<p>John loves pizza, and has strong opinions about the best pizza places in the area. John won&#39;t shut up about a topic when you express interest and he&#39;s drunk. John also likes to draw things when he gets drunk. Email sender knows this about John, and speculates that the odd, seemingly pizza-related handkerchief/map might be John&#39;s. </p>

<p>&quot;And I thought I’d share a couple more notes: We plan to heat the pool, so a swim is a possibility. Bonnie will be Uber Service to transport Ruby, Emerson, and Maeve Luzzatto (11, 9, and almost 7) so you’ll have some further entertainment, and they will be in that pool for sure.&quot;</p>

<p>Within that framework, emails like that bend to the sinister, imo. Who the hell is &quot;entertained&quot; by children playing in a pool?

<p><em>That said</em></p>

<p>Is sarcasm and dry humor just, not a thing among fans of pizzagate? As in, both parties know that young children are often obnoxious to have around, and are assuredly not &quot;entertainment&quot;... like... man, it really is kind of hard to explain sarcasm. Do you not joke around with your friends like that ever? Implying that something you both know isn&#39;t fun will actually be fun, just for the joke of it? To acknowledge without saying that it won&#39;t be fun, but it is happening? </p>

<p>As for the &quot;FBI Recognized pedo symbols and code words,&quot; are you referring to <a href="https://wikileaks.org/wiki/FBI-pedophile-symbols.pdf">this document?</a> You know what that document doesn&#39;t mention? Pizza. Anywhere on it. Best as I can tell, the only reference associating pizza w/ pedophilia (and the list of &quot;code words&quot; I&#39;ve seen floating around re: pizzagate) is 4chan, with the evidence essentially amounting to &quot;because I said so.&quot; </p>

<p>Anyways, I&#39;m not really interested in going further with this discussion, but isn&#39;t this a great example of something that should have been a mega-thread with continuing discussions, rather than scattered across the dozens of breathless &quot;new 4chan evidence!&quot; threads that were popping out?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are <em>literally</em> using conspiracy theorist logic to justify a bunch of very clear evidence of fucked up shit. Is it really that hard for you to imagine extremely powerful people are using their power in inhumane ways? We&#39;re talking about society being based on competition that rewards sociopathy, but it&#39;s too difficult for you to see all these blatant puzzle pieces point in a specific direction.</p>

<p>For fuck&#39;s sake, the guy has a statue of a Jeffrey Dahmer murder victim, and paintings of cannibalism. Is that fucking normal to you? Or is it all just sarcastic tongue-in-cheek edginess? That&#39;s just hilarious what you&#39;re willing to defend.</p>

<p>I also want to make clear that by being dismissive of Pizzagate I&#39;m not trying to be dismissive of the issue in general.

    <div class="md"><p>Trump is literally the establishment, and he&#39;s being used by the rest of the mainstream establishment like a whipping boy/heatsink. Rather than looking at any of the corruption that happened during the Primaries, it&#39;s <em>all</em> been thrown on Russia and they slowly let out more and more &quot;truth&quot; that it was coincidentally exactly what they thought, rather than being corruption from our side, which is exactly how it appeared. Amazing how well they just knew that would all work out that way, rather than the media implicating itself in clear collusion, we get to worry more about how <del>Seth Rich</del> Russia leaked all those things.</p>

<p>Attacking Trump is <em>literally</em> pro-establishment. If you were against the establishment, you&#39;d realize Trump is a product of the oligarchs flooding the media with hate and making him the &quot;Republican pied piper&quot; because they were so afraid that Hillary had nothing good to share and they couldn&#39;t possibly risk advertising for Sanders.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, think about it from his perspective. What&#39;s the benefit of doing what you say? Of addressing each point specifically? Would that stop the speculation? I don&#39;t think anyone can honestly claim that to be true.

<p>Furthermore, it is entirely possible that he doesn&#39;t remember the specifics of some of emails in question. For those buying in to Pizzagate, these are important, pivotal emails.

<p>It sounds like John Podesta typically sends Herbert Sandler pasta for Christmas, and in 2015, decided to mix it up by sending an assortment of cheeses. Sandler is making light of the change from tradition, and is jokingly asking if the cheeses will help his dominoes game compared to the traditional pastas.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t want to dismiss the idea that this all is code speak out of hand, but let&#39;s not pretend like that&#39;s literally the only conceivable explanation.</p>

<p>&quot;Do you think I’ll do better playing dominos on cheese than on pasta?&quot;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Tony Podesta has a close personal relationship with convicted pedophile Dennis hasert. </p>

<p>And Laura Silsby, former director of The New Life Children&#39;s Refuge, who had a relationship with HRC since 2001 is caught attempting to abduct and traffic 33 children from Haiti. </p>

<p>But now you are claiming that the emails were completely fabricated, because of WikiLeaks apparent history of editing and omission. The only claim made of editing to the leaked emails was adding the word confidential. </p>

<p>And again, no one credible has tried to claim that WikiLeaks has fabricated documents. Not once.</p>

<p>Your logic and reasoning stand up to no scrutiny. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Trump Russia conspiracy sounds great, I just don&#39;t think we can get a good idea of what&#39;s going on. We have right wingers off handedly dismissing it, demanding evidence they would never otherwise demand on this sub acting as if there is absolutely nothing connecting it to Trump. We have left wingers who <em>know</em> that Trump is guilty when they would demand what the Trump supporters are while it&#39;s their party under the microscope denying everything just the same. It&#39;s blind partisanship where each side gives every single last benefit of the doubt, no matter how absurd to their party, and declare guilt if they but so much as dream the other side did something.</p>

<p>This is why politics is such a sham in here. People want to play debunker when it suits them, and they want to buy evidence they would otherwise dismiss when it benefits them. Basically Trump supporters and Hillary supporters ruined that topic for us.</p>

<p>If there&#39;s no Trump/Russia conspiracy, can anyone explain this: Obama got wind of Russia meddling, he kicked out 35 Russian diplomats, seized two Russian compounds in America and imposed sanctions.

    <div class="md"><p>Laughable. </p>

<p>If he thinks it&#39;s horrible why has he <em>still</em> not enacted the bipartisan sanctions passed against them for interfering? </p>

<p>“We believe it was the DNC that did the ‘hacking’ as a way to distract from the many issues facing their deeply flawed candidate and failed party leader.”</p>

<p>July 25 — The FBI confirms it has opened an investigation into the hacking of the DNC computer network. In a tweet, Trump says: “The new joke in town is that Russia leaked the disastrous DNC e-mails, which should never have been written (stupid), because Putin likes me.”</p>

<p>In an interview that airs on RT, formerly known as Russia Today, Trump says it is “pretty unlikely” that the Russian government was behind the hacks targeting the Democratic Party. “I think maybe the Democrats are putting that out. Who knows? But I think that it’s pretty unlikely,” Trump says.</p>

<p>“I notice any time anything wrong happens they like to say, the Russians, the Russians — she doesn’t know it’s the Russians doing the hacking, maybe there is no hacking. But they always blame Russia.”</p>

<p>In an interview with Time magazine, Trump says, “<strong>I don’t believe they interfered.</strong> That became a laughing point, not a talking point, a laughing point. Any time I do something, they say ‘oh, Russia interfered.&#39;”</p>

<p>It just goes on and on, like this. </p>

<p>Now he wants his base to believe, &quot;I never said Russia didn&#39;t meddle.&quot; </p>

<p>Except he&#39;s on record saying, &quot;I don&#39;t believe they interfered.&quot; </p>

<p>All that&#39;s moot, however. He now is certain they interfered and still isn&#39;t doing shit about it. Why?</p>

The two biggest election meddlers on the planet are the USA and Israel, and yet everyone seems to care about Russia more than anything? If people outraged by this were logically consistent, there would be riots in the streets over Israel interfering in our elections and in our media so thoroughly for so many decades. There would be major protests over the fact that the USA meddles in other countries elections through propaganda, through sanctions, hell, sometimes through coups.

It blows my mind how a conspiracy sub doesn&#39;t entertain the possibility that a person in one of the highest positions of power could be part of a conspiracy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s the tough question, and I&#39;m not really sure I have a good answer. I don&#39;t think censorship of political opinions in general is the right move, but there&#39;s got to be some level of middle ground to operate on. </p>

<p>Like, political talk is fine if there&#39;s a purpose and relation to the subject being discussed, but blatant shit slinging and sniping on the usual left/right tropes is removed? I don&#39;t know. I&#39;m not sure I&#39;ve ever seen a really good way to handle political talk in a message board/forum.</p>

<p>And funny that other times you&#39;ve commented I&#39;ve seen others calling out that most of the subreddits aren&#39;t even active, and yet you&#39;ve never updated the list.

<p>Completely incorrect, unless you&#39;re using a really dumb definition of the word &quot;conspiracy&quot;.</p>

<p>You&#39;re not wrong, but that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s a good thing. Distrust the MSM all you want, but if your distrust leads you to oppose what they&#39;re reporting <em>just on principal</em>, your eyes are more closed than any &quot;sheeple&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Both sides, well msm took the russia hack side. Everyone else laughed it put becuase of lack of meat on them claims. Everything establsihment and corrupt US has done is contrary to russia collusion claims. Even when simple logic is employed that narrative is weak, when reading reports and somewhere is barried a clause stating that the info provided is not proof, but an indiscator its just wow. When US has been beating its chest with NSA, cia and fbi claims to be masters of hacking and control, suddenly a bunch of russian trolls can outwitt worlds largest defence budgets and manpower. Then there is lack or reporting on any other country hacking. Seriously, you dont smell bullshit when its ONLY russia? What about china, sudan, iran, turkey? What about NKorea and other countreies, do they sort of not exist? Conspiracy dissmisses russia trump collusion becausr they take one look at how trump is running the gov and realise that its all the same, same puppet, same corrupt corporate agenda. Where russians used to be soviets and red scrae was used to dissmental social movements like worker unions, etc all the markers are that this is a diversion. Not an actual conspiracy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I express my opinion. And I am a part of many comunities. Atm the discussion is regarding US and their propoganda. Not russian, russia dorsnt control the media, 6 US corporations do. And the narrative that media spews affects the world because ppaces like austrlia where i am from, this is toxic. If I had to choose I would go with russia, because USA is acting very badly for the last 2 decades. And the people are complacent with the direction their leaders are taking international policy and domestic policy. I want a better world, not one where corruption is so blatant that propoganda that keeps churning shit narrative is influencing millions to support it. I am dead tired of hearing one sided emotionaly manipulative arguments for pro war american efforts. I am not alone anlot of europians have the same option. Yet because its contrary to the establishment of US politics its somehow russia love or russia troll. Yes, lets suppress all views contrary to that, because thats healthy as fuck!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Three problems with Trump Russia:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>It is being pushed in ungodly force by the LEAST credible forces alive. Any user of this sub pre 2015 would be as astounded as I am to see the media, politicians, celebrities, and companies being so blatant about the narrative. Trump Russia is not only predicated on Trump&#39;s corruption, but that the Intel agencies, mainstream media, and DNC are the &quot;good guys&quot;. Nobody here could buy that hence the mass shills.</p></li>
<li><p>Trump&#39;s actions in office. It&#39;s been over a year now and Trump has been doing pretty much exactly what he said he would. Many parts of this like TPP and calling out fake news were cornerstones of this subreddit&#39;s interests. Alongside the shills, there is definitely a section of the user base that rejects the idea that a president could EVER be doing any good but that dwindles as time goes on.</p></li>
<li><p>Zero evidence. There is ZERO evidence. None. With the entire establishment against him, they have absolutely nothing on the guy. The only thing left is the argument that the Mueller investigation isn&#39;t over yet and you can&#39;t know the future. Weak.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Trump Russia is just not a conspiracy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We should start looking into ways to prevent this sub from going off track too often. Shills not only try to reinforce mainstream narratives, they probably also post dumb theories to get us distracted and going down the wrong path. The more bullshit they post, the more dilute the sub becomes and the more difficult it is to obtain useful information. </p>

<p>I think there should be a periodic reminder that <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/70qvx7/updated_list_of_proven_conspiracies_and_hidden/">there have been a great deal of proven conspiracies</a>, some of them being international in scope, and involving large groups of people who got away with it for many years. This completely wipes out several of their main narratives, including the claim that the government must be too incompetent to pull off large conspiracies. </p>

<p>Periodically focusing on conspiracy facts, rather than theories, especially when many of the proven ones are very similar to current unproven theories, would do a lot of good here. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The question of &quot;why&quot; is 90% of what makes it fun. Would it be to have him be a puppet, and turn the US effectively into an extension of Russia? If that was the goal, they somewhat failed as people are looking into it. But at the same time, politically speaking, we are more like Russia, and Russia is more like us than we have ever been, so maybe that one is not too far off. Or would it be simply to make america look weak so that other countries, like China, have an easier time becoming the world super-power. (China being better buddies with Russia, it would benefit them.)</p>

<p>Or, As Putin likes to just send fighter jets near america on holidays, and weird shit like that, what if it was all just the <strong>ultimate</strong> annoying prank? Just a reminder that Russia is clever, and that if they really wanted to, they could really mess shit up. Just like is implied by the jets that come close to US airspace. Though, imaging the amount of effort for a prank seems unthinkable. But then again, maybe <strong>that is the point.</strong> That it wasn&#39;t much effort.</p>

<p>There is the obvious lack of new sanctions being a perk, so maybe there&#39;s some incentive in that.</p>

<p>Or perhaps it&#39;s not Russia, it&#39;s another entity (Such as North Korea) doing a good job of covering it&#39;s tracks, by pitting the US against it&#39;s classic, cold-war era enemy?</p>

<p>Or even still, and this one is <strong>my favorite</strong>: The US government saw a lot of unrest under Bush and even Obama. What would be <strong>the best</strong> way to make americans happy for the conventional political system of yesteryear? Make it look like the modern one is compromised! Today it seems like people <strong>wish</strong> they had someone like George W Bush, rather than Trump. There&#39;s a lot of positive press for McCain, someone who lost a bid at the presidency before. Mueller has become a hero republican to the democrats. </p>

<p>So Trump leaves, Russia takes the blame, the US goes back to business as usual, with no pesky &quot;occupy&quot; movements or anything like that. Think about it, if someone just like George W is elected, people will be far less inclined to complain, because &quot;by comparison to the Trump Russia thing, this is great!&quot;</p>

<p>America seems to unify when there is a threat. So why start an all-out war when you could just make it look like we&#39;ve been infiltrated?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is sad how all the real fringe topics has become such a breath of fresh air the rare times they fight the tide of shills and get any attention at all.</p>

<p>This sub has been dominated by political conspiracy topics and gaslighting for over a year now. I think that there is a massive interest in subverting the conspiracy community to get in and control counter culture narrative before they become mainstream as a result of Trump using them as a resource during his campaign. There also seems to be QUITE an effort to shill MSM outlet here, which is absurdly ironic and reflects a clear lack of understanding what conspiracy minded individuals would consider credible. </p>

<p>There was also a time not long in the past where the REAL gold was in the comments here instead of the main posts. Now it is just a bunch of partisan BS with comments like &quot;This!&quot; heavily upvoted to slide real discussion, and every other post is antagonistic of the one above it.</p>

<p>Somehow it is also okay to insult the sub in general and its users by calling it full of Shareblue shills or that it is TD_2.0 all the time. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mostly agree with what you say, but I did have a point to make about the MSM shill part. I totally agree with being skeptical, and the threat of corporate influence in MSM sources (especially TV) is a real one, but at the same time MSM has been involved in breaking lots of conspiracies over the years.</p>

<p>Someone else in the thread linked to a list of <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/70qvx7/updated_list_of_proven_conspiracies_and_hidden/">proven conspiracy theories</a> and I see a big list of MSM links and Wiki articles that often make reference to big newspapers and other MSM sources being involved in revealing the conspiracies. </p>

<p>Obviously that doesn&#39;t mean you can blindly trust any WAPO article you find, but you should also not completely ignore them either.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with the IDEA of what you are saying, but I feel like we should be creating the context of what is being reported ourselves, and not rely on the editorial departments to spin it for us.</p>

<p>There are some really good, and objective journalists at a lot of mainstream outlets (Washington Post and Fox News included) but their work is usually colored up and defined by the editorial department and that is usually what is actually disseminated to the masses. </p>

<p>By controlling context, they can publish proof of real conspiracies but control and spin what elements that people focus on and will avoid the difficult questions that point to issues or the larger perspective of what they mean. The outlet will always paint a favorable perspective for those provided the information with the goal of gaining access to the resource for future stories. It is a mutually beneficial relationship in most cases.</p>

<p>The majority of &quot;known&quot; conspiracies are actually limited hangouts.

Says there&#39;s &quot;no evidence at all!,&quot; gets all upset too. And he wrote a whole book denying that the establishment would have had any reason to kill JFK, which a LIE. Chomsky knows better; he&#39;s working for the bad guys, in my assessment.</p>

<p>And his linguistics career is absolutely bizarre. Chomsky&#39;s big idea was build a machine that could speak and understand all languages in proper grammar. It&#39;s something the CIA has been extremely interested in, originally in what they called Project Jason. Google &quot;Christopher Knight Noam Chomsky&quot; if you want a lengthy analysis of his linguistics career that exposes it as reactionary. </p>

<p>Nobody practices or defends classic liberalism anymore. At least not before Stuart Mill&#39;s classic liberalism, which shares many ideas with neoliberalism. It&#39;s useless to place it in an spectrum in the last century. </p>

<p>This is a good observation, but this is where I disagree. While words do sometimes change their meanings over time, and I am not saying that they do not, it&#39;s dangerous and downright subversive, nearly Orwellian, to define these politically charged labels based solely on the popular sentiments of the times in which we live without putting them in a historical context. Doing this is exactly what the Chomsky quote is talking about: one is the effect of the other, I&#39;d have to think about which is the cart and which is the horse. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not arguing about Obama being to the left of Bush. I&#39;m arguing about the original Chomsky quote about the narrow window that is the spectrum of ideas that is acceptable to debate.</p>

<p>Think of a number line. 5 is less than 6. We are freely open to debate any number between 5 and 6. Maybe Chomsky is a 4.9 or a 5.1. Trump is maybe a 5.7 or 5.8. A half century ago we were debating numbers between 6 and 7. Two centuries ago we were debating numbers between 9 and 10. Whether or not there is a concerted effort or conspiracy to drag the debate to lower numbers over time, or if it&#39;s something of a feature (or bug) inherent of the current system is up for debate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you a socialist? Or a Marxist? What I am describing is the dialectic - practically confirming it. Marx was not hesitant to compare feudal times, describing the transition of which to democracy, to capitalism, to socialism, as &quot;progress leftwards&quot; to the eventual goal or telos of communism. (although I disagree with the notion that this dialectic is entirely materialistic in nature.)</p>

<p>If a moderate centrist person hopped in a time machine from 1918 to 2018, they would come out the other side a far-right winged person even if their beliefs did not change. </p>

<p>This is not particular of the past century and I don&#39;t mean to portray it as such. It&#39;s just that we are all more familiar with the 20th century than earlier ones. </p>

<p>But even looking at just communists of 100 years ago compared to communists of today. A 2018 communist would consider a 1918 communist reactionary. Pro-gun, pro-military ww2 veterans, anti-gay, worked in a coal mine, etc. (accurately describes the right wing of today). About their only similarities would be that they&#39;re poor and anti-christian.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That last bit is certainly true. They&#39;re right wing parties, though. Consistently against everything the true left is about. </p>

<p>I mean, you can argue that, by saying what&#39;s true now is different than from the past. Sure if you want to argue that, then you&#39;re right. But the fact is, the left in the past was about giving control to the workers. Labour parties commonly are not really about the workers anymore, despite the name. They do everything in name of the worker, but for some reason keep the problems of the workers intact, like private property. </p>

<p>That whole discussion has been removed and now it&#39;s about things that shouldn&#39;t even be discussed in the first place. That&#39;s the shift to the right. Not talking about socialism anymore, but instead on how to survive capitalism as a worker. This shift is quite obvious. </p>

<p>You&#39;re not even wrong that most right wing parties are close to the center. But that&#39;s not the issue. It&#39;s the fact that left wing parties are far closer to these center parties. </p>

<p>The left, economically, is socialism. When left of the center doesn&#39;t even entertain the idea of socialism, how are they left wing? Right wing is capitalism, left wing is socialism. How is left/center still capitalism? That makes no sense to me. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Socialism-capitalism is not an on-off switch. Centre-left would be people who believe in moderately to highly regulated capitalism. Furthermore, economic policy is not the only policy to consider. Social programs and their funding is also a way to rate where someone is politically. I rate Bernie Left Wing since he believes in a lot of social programs and highly regulated capitalism. Simply because you&#39;re not fully supportive of a socialist economic system doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t be left wing. I think you&#39;re thinking in too black and white of terms. Either socialism or capitalism. There are nuances to regulated capitalism and mixed economies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s funny you mention nuance, because according to what you just wrote, there&#39;s socialism on the far left, without any nuance whatsoever and just capitalism anything right from that (including the moderate left). </p>

<p>So you&#39;re basically saying there&#39;s no difference between socialism and communism, there&#39;s no nuance there. There&#39;s just nuance in capitalism and you can be left wing and pro capitalism.</p>

<p>You&#39;re not 100% wrong, of course not, you&#39;re not an idiot, I can see that. Most of what you&#39;re saying is true. The thing is, this is all part of the shift of politics towards the right wing. </p>

<p>I also have to comment on your idea that highly regulated capitalism is a left wing principle. It isn&#39;t. You can be for or pro regulation within the right wing. Libertarian would be against it. Fascism would be for it. </p>

<p>Same goes for the left. Libertarian (left, as it originally was) is against regulation whereas those leaning towards the ideas of establishing communism are very pro regulations. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not a left/right thing. It&#39;s an authoritarian or libertarian thing. These nuances have all disappeared lately. Nowadays you would consider Hillary to be center left. Which in my opinion is ridiculous. Her policies are eerily close to what right wing parties (albeit that they&#39;re close to the center) are saying. In certain areas she&#39;s actually further right. </p>

<p>This is mostly because the DNC is the further left in the two relevant political parties in the states. Take The Netherlands for example, where a far right party like FvD is further right than PVV, which are mostly further right than VVD. Then you&#39;ve got D66, which are further left than Clinton&#39;s policies are, but still considered right wing. Then you&#39;ve got the labour party, which is considered left but often criticized for being too willing to accept right wing ideas, mind you they&#39;re way more left wing than Clinton is. Then you&#39;ve got a whole bunch of parties that are much further to the left than that. GroenLinks is left wing, but they entertain right wing ideas because those ideas still fit in with the actual left wing ideas. Then you&#39;ve got a few parties that are left wing by current narrative, without actually being left wing. The type of party I&#39;m against, because identity politics and immigration have nothing to do with left/right wing. The furthest left is the Socialist Party which I criticize for not actually saying anything about abolishing private property, which is the core idea of Socialism. Another indicator that the political spectrum has moved to the right as a whole. </p>

<p>As far as regulated capitalism goes, the more regulation you support the more left you are and bice versa. Of course right wing supports some regulations. Anarcho-capitalist are about the only group that support no regulation or government at all.</p>

<li><p>EXTREMELY deregulated market and bank economics. NEOLIBERALS (far right).</p></li>
<li><p>Removing/reducing funding of social programs OR injecting crony capitalist corporate interference to make the social programs inefficient and expensive (i.e. privatization: using our taxes &quot;for profit&quot; which is extremely right wing and crony capitalist too).</p></li>
<li><p>Warmongers....need I say more? NEOCONSERVATIVES (these are far right warmongers specifically/war profiteering).</p></li>
<li><p>Democrat party colluded with corporate CNN/MSM
and shat on Bernie 24/7. Bernie&#39;s policies were only
of FDR style Social Democracy which is almost American centrist.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Yet Fox was saying &quot;OMG 90% TAX RATE&quot; when it was much less than for the TOP tax rate let alone the normal tax brackets most people fall into. CNN favored extremist TPP Soros WALLSTREET shill CLINTON.
The Dem election was rigged in favor of Clinton.
MSM is not left wing, centrist or moderate right and neither are the parties they shill for.
CORPORATIONS (controlled by banksters) are EXTREME capitalists, not moderate in any way.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Obamacare is crony capitalist, why didn&#39;t Obama go for
single payer healthcare? BECAUSE HE&#39;S NOT LEFT WING.
Even NEOliberal Europe has some shitty form of single payer, (some countries
have the crappy privatized form, some might have the legit socialized form)
but America doesn&#39;t even have that despite having it during FDR&#39;s time.
Instead Obamacare/Repub alternative, they&#39;re both corporate shits for profit at our expensive.
They don&#39;t give a fuck about us.</p></li>
<li><p>STATE SURVEILLANCE. NSA authoritarian shit. Death penalty too.
War on drugs, private prison system, false flags like 9/11, etc. etc.
Does this shit sound like left vs right? Or far right vs far right?
Makes you think the Deep State theories have something to them.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Since Reagan, the bastard NEOliberals and NEOconservatives have gained power.
Trickle down economics bullshit. 30 years or so since then, the gap between
extreme rich and extreme poor has only gotten much bigger.</p>

<p>The elites control these parties, please stop defending them.
They&#39;re only after profit and therefore control: FULL NWO fascism/feudalist centralized control:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You don&#39;t know what feudalism means. Don&#39;t use that word.</p>

<p>You come across as extremely conspiratorial that some class of people out there have complete control. In reality, chaos reigns and people only delude themselves into believing someone or some group has complete control. They don&#39;t. They couldn&#39;t. Keeping a secret between two people is hard enough, let alone thousands. You have conflated corporate influence and donations as some sort of illuminati-esque conspiracy. Yes, the rich and influential do have lots of power. No, they do not have much ability to influence outside factors or individual decision making. </p>

<p>Secondarily, your scale makes little to no sense. Hitler advocated social programs distributed along ethnic lines. Only Germans or others deemed acceptable were allowed the social programs. That&#39;s certainly not centrist thought. The racial laws and policies to jail, castrate, take rights, take property, and ultimately exterminate undesirables is far from centrist or centre-right. The fact that this graph rates Hitler more leftist and only slightly more authoritarian than most American politicians is laughable. This seriously comes off as a bad joke. You&#39;re insane.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, I know what feudalism is, and don&#39;t tell me what to do.
Ironic you imply me as ignorant and yet you claim the corporate parties that engage in false flag attacks,
globalist economics, insane deregulation, anti-worker rhetoric, etc. as normal. 
They&#39;re extremists and hence we have the gap between the super poor and super rich
getting even larger. What&#39;s moderate about that? Are you in the wrong sub?
Defending warmongers and wallstreet?</p>

<p>I&#39;m conspiratorial? Yeah what sub is this? I didn&#39;t imply full control,
but certainly disproportionate control and hence why the state of things today are miserable
despite the potential for change. They&#39;re just trying to increase it to full slavery levels.</p>

<p>Hitler was extremely authoritarian and so your statement about him isn&#39;t contradictory to what my post said. I never said he was centrist.
His economics were slightly right of center but the authoritarianism reveals his corporate cronyism, mass surveillance and racial shit.
I don&#39;t know why you&#39;re trying to derail.....it&#39;s something shills tend to do on this sub. Hmmm.
His economics were not that crazy, far right NEOliberalism is crazy. But he was an extremely authoritarian maniac.
If you can&#39;t even look at the American NSA state surveillance, false flags, private federal reserve, wars for profit, basic corruption, rigged primaries, etc. and just resort to calling
me insane because you&#39;d rather not burden yourself with the thought about the corporate fascists who want to take over, maybe
you should re-evaluate your worldview or attitude or something. </p>

<p>If you want to put your head in the sand while
there&#39;s a hostile takeover, be my guest. NEOliberalism has caused major damage in the last few decades
and if we ignore it it&#39;s going to get hella worse. But I&#39;m not falling for that shit.
We have extreme capitalists with extreme amounts of power and governments
are infiltrated with secret societies, warmongers and banksters.
Be aware or ignore it at your own peril. I&#39;m not going to waste my time further with shills
and ignorant people. The left vs right spectrum is outdated. Most accurate form is two axes. Economics and social issues.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol what?
I&#39;m a center left libertarian socialist, I don&#39;t believe in alt right bullshit (much of it is misguided bullshit at least).
Authoritarians consolidate control and try to centralize the economy. Feudal times were pretty authoritarian, no?</p>

<p>Anyway, I&#39;m not saying &quot;de-centralized&quot; economics are necessarily a good idea by itself....it would be good as long as you have reasonable amounts of regulation. Decentralized doesn&#39;t become benevolent if there&#39;s zero regulation (competing or allied mafia corporations would just destroy anyone in their way). Hence, I just suggest removing money from politics and then our politicians will stop being corrupt retards and start thinking about the common man instead of the corporations, when deciding their economic policies.</p>

<p>Bernie&#39;s policies at <em>best</em> are social democratic. :)</p>

<p>Socialism kind of implies the abolition of private property. This needs a definition of where personal property (allowed under socialism) ends, and private property takes over.</p>

<p>You could put a dollar amount on that. Like, say, 5 million USD. Everything over that amount is not legal to own. When you hit that amount you have &quot;won&quot; the mini capitalist game inside socialism.</p>

<p>Not having &quot;the abolition of private property&quot; in your program makes you a social democrat at best. They argue for a little socialist game (of income redistribution), inside capitalism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well that would make sense. I don&#39;t remember how what we read from him, (&quot;Manufacturing Consent&quot; was one book), pertained to what I was supposed to be learning about international studies. I also didn&#39;t really follow Chomsky himself at all, especially after college. I just get trickle down in places like this sub from other people who prop him up or shoot him down. Whether wingman_joe is right, and Chomsky does think himself fringe or whether it&#39;s just some of his angstier fans that do, I honestly don&#39;t know. It&#39;s a good way to sell books.</p>

<p>He always came across as long-winded, circle-talk to me. There&#39;s no doubt he&#39;s smart, but he knows his craft and how to squeeze every ounce of attention from his reader by writing entire paragraphs and chapters filled with academic descriptions and big words to get across a message that could easily have been summarized with the first and maybe last sentence of any given paragraph he wrote.</p>

<p>Guess, I&#39;m kinda doing the same thing. I could have just said I find him to be long-winded.</p>

<p>Anyway, my opinion of the man doesn&#39;t mean much. I was too stoned to remember half the time. At least I managed to keep my drinking to black-out levels in check until the weekend came around. </p>

<p>I&#39;m no expert on historical affairs, but through some light researching it seems that the US didn&#39;t really begin attempts at destabilization until several years after the founding of Israel (05/14/1948 according to a google search).

<p>Gaslighting is a form of manipulation that seeks to sow seeds of doubt in a targeted individual or in members of a targeted group, hoping to make them question their own memory, perception, and sanity.

    <div class="md"><p>I definitely question my sanity when I use this website. For example, I get hit multiple times an hour by comments loudly proclaiming that some subreddit called &quot;T_D&quot; is ruining reddit.</p>

<p>Which is funny because this &quot;T_D&quot; subreddit has been banned from the front page for months now. So I am not sure how they are spreading their message to the rest of reddit.</p>

<p>While people on this website scream about the &quot;T_D&quot; menace, I am bombarded by multiple front page posts per hour that aggressively try to plant the seed in my mind that Donald Trump and his followers are the anti-Christ.</p>

<p>I click into subreddits that have nothing to do with politics and I am hit by submissions upvoted into the thousands that paint Donald Trump and his supporters as the anti-Christ.</p>

<p>I enter comment sections about topics that have nothing to do with politics and I see top comments upvoted into the thousands that paint Trump and his supporters as the anti-Christ.</p>

<p>I browse these comment sections by new and controversial and I regularly see comments saying &quot;X user posts in T_D&quot; and these comments are rewarded and the offending commenter gets berated, belittled, and downvoted as if he/she was the anti-Christ.</p>

<p>This is the reddit that I have been seeing every single day for months now and while I am witnessing this with my eyes and my brain, an extremely loud voice continues to cut through assuring me that members of &quot;T_D&quot; are systematically destroying and &quot;taking over&quot; reddit.</p>

<p>So what should I believe? The loud voice that repeats the same thing over and over about Trump and &quot;T_D&quot; members destroying reddit or what I am actually witnessing: members of the anti-Trump brigade dominating the front page every single time I log in or enter 99% of comment threads.</p>

<p>Point is, there aren&#39;t rules about down voting just because the users history or you disagree with what they said. The point of down voting was always to encourage higher quality commentary to be at the top of the page.

<p>Sorry it&#39;s not for anyone. I tried to have a civil discussion in <a href="/r/conservative">/r/conservative</a> and I was banned immediately, I tried  to fact check T_D once, not being a dick, just saying &quot;hey this isn&#39;t true, check this article&quot; Boom banned.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sick of people saying that conservatives have it so rough here, I told everyone on politics to cool their roll when the Russia stuff first started coming up in 2016, I was down voted into hell, but  I WASN&#39;T BANNED. Same with <a href="/r/democrats">/r/democrats</a>, I said things against the grain, got down votes but no ban.</p>

<p>I have only been banned in conservative outlets. So when you say having a conservative view on reddit is not for civil discourse, I think it&#39;s because they don&#39;t allow civil discourse to happen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are so terribly correct it&#39;s not even funny. It seems to me that the only people that gaslight are the left. And the MSM pays to persuade them but instead of adverts they pay to control what shows up for sites like Reddit. To go with their narrative. That&#39;s why even though I don&#39;t think Trump is what is right for this country, we shouldn&#39;t be focused on &quot;if Melania loves him&quot; and stupid bullshit I see everyday on FP. Every side is wasting their time arguing with one another online as if it&#39;ll change anything even if you do change someone&#39;s mind. And you don&#39;t change someone&#39;s mind by downvoting and degrading them with name-calling as if we&#39;re elementary again anyway. I&#39;ve had some of the most understanding, kind, and empathetic views and comments, go ahead, take a look. See how much I get down voted DESPITE being progressive enough to where I say when I&#39;m wrong and/or didn&#39;t think about another view that was pointed out. Even when I get attacked, I never cuss anyone  and I&#39;m always trying to understand why people see the way they see. </p>

<p>Source: I&#39;m subscribed to both r/politics and r/the_donald because I&#39;m genuinely concerned that it&#39;s all a conspiracy and there is a civil war being implemented in our society. 
Ps.. Everyone is wrong to me. But Trump isn&#39;t where your rage needs be focused, he&#39;s obviously a ploy, a puppet. Everyone knows the president has no real power. Look at the JFK conspiracy. Let&#39;s swallow our pride and figure out what the fuck is really going on. Like the effort y&#39;all put into who&#39;s missing on Reddit this week. Cause if we don&#39;t all work together how is our country supposed to? </p>

<p>I feel exactly the same way and I am surprised this topic is not being discussed more. It should really be blatantly obvious to anyone paying attention and not brainwashed by party politics that a very real life-threatening civil war is around the corner if people continue to allow themselves to be whipped into angry internet mobs so easily.</p>

<p>Its like they believe that this hate will somehow stay in the digital realm and that it has no connection to real life. Which is fucking absurd. The hate is real and very real consequences are going to come from it.</p>

<p>Are they good things or are they overwhelmingly negative? You and I both know its 99% negative. Thats not reality. Thats not how reality works.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Do you still agree that this is how reality works? Is there no one that you can think of that would receive mostly negative press? Or do you think everyone get 50% positive and 50% negative? </p>

<p>Is there sensationalism. Certainly. But it all depends on what media you subscribe to. Im personally into the more well researched news agencies and not random opinion bloggers. </p>

<p>I would argue that would cause false equivalence in the media. 
An a debate about climate change we pit the combined knowledge of 100 scientists against a single person who has nothing but his opinion and weigh them fairly. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>you literally called me a libertarian because of my username. No other indication of my post would say anything about my political beliefs besides my disdain for how the DNC was manhandled by the Clinton campaign.</p>

<p>fiscal policy is awesome. finally can afford to open up my storefront in town with the new tax proposals. probably be able to provide 2-3 30k a year jobs, pretty good for a town of 5k, and county of 15k.</p>

<p>also, I hope national concealed carry is passed. can&#39;t wait to visit back home and actually be able to have a gun. so tired of walking the piss smelling streets of southern California, getting harassed by cholos and the homeless, unarmed.</p>

<p>deficit doesn&#39;t mean shit to me, it&#39;s all debt currency anyway. If this shortfall even has a chance of cutting some of our outrageous spending, or better yet, removing the fed, I&#39;m good with it. if not we can always QE as always. I&#39;m good with military spending so I&#39;ll just cut you off there. </p>

<p>but keep name calling and getting upset because people are adults and don&#39;t fit into your bubble.</p>

<p>also, it&#39;s not about not voting certain parties. it&#39;s about some of us remembering Hillary Clinton, how much of a crooked snake she&#39;s always been her whole career, the constant corruption both prior and after her husband&#39;s election, and then the icing on the cake-burying Bernie.</p>

<p>It’s also worth noting there’s a high amount of Russian-backed right wing propaganda posted on Reddit too.  Russian twitter bot @GOP_Ten had dozens of top posts on r/The_Donald with at least 5-12k upvotes on each post. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been ruthlessly filtering political subs from my front page, and just as you&#39;ve described, this shit is seeping out into every other normal subreddit as well. Then I have to wonder, &quot;do I filter <a href="/r/AdviceAnimals">/r/AdviceAnimals</a> now?&quot; etc.</p>

<p>... and even with all my filters, <a href="/r/The_Donald">/r/The_Donald</a> almost never shows up in the first few pages. There&#39;s definitely some shenanigans going on.</p>

<p>Upvoting/downvoting is definitely cancer, if the goal of a discussion board is to avoid being overtaken by shills and trolls and astroturfers. It&#39;s far too easy to suppress dissent and completely take over a given subreddit. Or if that doesn&#39;t work, they can always take over a mod account and start erratically removing good content just to frustrate legit participants.</p>

<p>For all its warts and user-unfriendliness, I have yet to find anything as good as 4chan for unsuppressed discussion. There are plenty of shills but they don&#39;t have the power to simply downvote things into oblivion.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not a fan of purely technical solutions, but somebody definitely needs to create a new forum that utilizes proof-of-work or some kind of web of trust to prevent bad actors from so easily spamming and astroturfing the fuck out of it.</p>

<p>You want the conspiracy?  It&#39;s people like this trying to undermine people being upset with their government.  Posts like this push the line of complacency with the government.  &quot;Supporters good, dissenters bad&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>The term originates in the systematic psychological manipulation of a victim by her husband in the 1938 stage play Gas Light, known as Angel Street in the United States, and the film adaptations released in 1940 and 1944. In the story, a husband attempts to convince his wife and others that she is insane by manipulating small elements of their environment and insisting that she is mistaken, remembering things incorrectly, or delusional when she points out these changes. The original title stems from the dimming of the gas lights in the house that happened when the husband was using the gas lights in the flat above while searching for the jewels belonging to a woman whom he had murdered. The wife correctly notices the dimming lights and discusses the phenomenon with her husband, but he insists that she just imagined a change in the level of illumination.</p>

<p>The term &quot;gaslighting&quot; has been used colloquially since the 1960s to describe efforts to manipulate someone&#39;s perception of reality. In a 1980 book on child sexual abuse, Florence Rush summarized George Cukor&#39;s Gaslight (1944) based on the play and wrote, &quot;even today the word [gaslighting] is used to describe an attempt to destroy another&#39;s perception of reality.&quot;</p>

<p>I&#39;m usually skeptical of things when I post here, I also have posted on other conspiracy/alt news sites, have been doing so for years. I constantly get accused of being a &quot;shill&quot; for asking questions that should, if the theory I am questioning is legitimate, have a clear answer. I frequently get called a &quot;shill&quot;. </p>

<p>I have come to the conclusion that the people yelling &quot;shill&quot; are unable to tell a &quot;shill&quot; from an honest poster.</p>

<p>Also if I were involved with Dr. They or whoever the last place I would pay for shilling would be r/conspiracy. You&#39;re never going to change anyone&#39;s mind or influence anyone here.</p>

You went off the rails with this &quot;political argument&quot;.  Sorry man, unless someone else here chimes in, I&#39;m done replying.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re really emotionally charged up about this, and the hypocrisy is yours, not mine.  Last reply to address that and hopefully inform you the way I was asking you to try to inform yourself.</p>

<p>I listed Correct The Record because they literally did what the comment I replied to said is the problem with this sub: astroturfing.  </p>

<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correct_the_Record">From Wikipedia</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Correct the Record was a super PAC founded by David Brock. It supported Hillary Clinton&#39;s 2016 presidential campaign. <strong>The super PAC aimed to find and confront social media users who posted unflattering messages about Clinton and paid anonymous tipsters for unflattering scoops about Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump,</strong> including audio and video recordings and internal documents.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Fox News and Breitbart (as you mentioned) are not super PACs that literally paid shills to troll and astroturf social media sites like Reddit.</strong>  Please, inform me and everyone else of any similar  social media manipulation group that you know of, regardless of political affiliation. CTR was not simply a &quot;politically biased news outlet&quot;, as you are saying the groups you and I listed are.  </p>

<p><strong>And again, you fail to acknowledge the 2</strong> <strong><em>apolitical</em></strong> <strong>and covert intelligence community operations I mentioned, and the significance as to why.</strong> You&#39;re the one who keeps seeing &quot;sides&quot; and seeing things through political eyes.</p>

<p>Sorry dude, you calling me a hypocrite is not cool, when you were throwing shade from the start, locked in to your idea that my comment was political when I was literally telling you that was not my intent, and explaining why. Had to address that.  I wish you the best in this crazy journey through life. Over and out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The point I&#39;m about to make is <em>hypothetical</em>, meant to demonstrate the feasibility of a conspiracy, not provide evidence for the existence of one.</p>

<p>Remember that <a href="http://msutoday.msu.edu/news/2017/msu-scholars-find-21-trillion-in-unauthorized-government-spending-defense-department-to-conduct/">over $20 trillion are missing</a> from Department of Defense records.  How much do 100,000 full-time shills cost at $100/hour, you may ask? $20 billion/year, which is 1/1000th of the missing money.  Theoretically, they would each have no idea of each other&#39;s existence and wouldn&#39;t need to know the ultimate goals they serve.  They probably wouldn&#39;t know they who they work for at all.  Up it to $1000/hour (enough money such that you could keep a secret) and we&#39;re still talking about 1% of the missing money per year of this hypothetical program.</p>

<p>Seems feasible to me.</p>

<p>This is a sub that should reject all politicians.</p>

<p>it saddens me as a critical thinker that this sub is at its lowest point in its history.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is the problem with a lot of conspiracy theorists. You claim to be critical thinkers but then reject anything mainstream solely because it is mainstream. Wouldn&#39;t a critical thinker evaluate everything individually instead of making blanket rejections because something belongs to a category? </p>

<p>I used to be really into conspiracy theories but became disillusioned when I realized that most people would buy into anything that contradicted the mainstream and be dismissive of anything that came from the mainstream. So what I&#39;ve seen in this sub is a lot more people start to apply their critical thinking to not only mainstream claims but also to conspiracy theory claims, and I think that&#39;s a good thing. It might make this place less fun but it does make it more critical which is supposed to be the point.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Probably because the whole of conspiracy has been used as a political weapon recently.  The whole Trump thing is clearly to blame.  He figured out how to include conspiracy people in his political speeches in a way that only Ron Paul has really tried before.  It sucks that he has dragged us down with him and now people respect us even less than before. Funny how the same people who fought against Bush during 9/11 are fighting for Trump like he&#39;s the savior right now.</p>

When you catch a real person, they dont disagree with the statement, but they dont fully support it. When its a shill or a bot its a simple source needed, or your a russian troll. Seriously, just about done with this site, front page is all agebda politics and lack of intelectualism is starting to get to me. All the subs filled with pilitical aligned posts, even thise that used to have rules against it, like adviceanimals. </p>

<p>I am not on here to read constant lies and propoganda, and then being called a troll when I point out either hypocracies or lack of substancial or any evidence for the claims. I am not here for mindless identity politics and trump/russia hate of the msm. Yet there it is, all across reddit. I come to r/conspiracy to get away from it, where discussion feels more real, like yes there are whacj theories on here and attempts to djscredit, but where else is there left. Used to be nice here, but they(shills, bots, trolls) are invading here as well and its taining comment section and posting. If this is how corporate run america wants to fight the infomrarional cyber war of this 22nd century, its just loosing audience. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>To be fair, accusing someone of being a shill is a trend that was not only started by those paid by election campaigns/governments but also perpetuated by real users here.</p>

<p>I voted for Hillary in 2016. I&#39;m just a fucking normal, albeit liberal, Citizen.</p>

<p>Can&#39;t tell you how many times my opinion was discounted here by posters because &quot;lol, you voted for Hillary, you&#39;re a shill&quot;.</p>

<p>I try to look into the posting history of people, but the entire point of the Russian influence campaign isn&#39;t that they do it themselves. The point is that they deliberately inflame tensions. Which means that their statements are lost, but the people they influence are genuine.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with this. I remember a while back this sub sparked alot of my interest in what may actually be happening in the world. What about corporations with too much money or the shady dealings of the US military? What about how television saturates people in the desire to spend money on shit that will give us cancer or give us diabetes? What is reality and why does the government restrict things that make you question it? Why are plants and molecules illegal? Fuck the system even the phone I&#39;m using can be a tool for someone to spy on me or extract my personal information.  There is a reason this sub changed and its because people asked too many questions. All of these big changes happened because people became more aware all of a sudden. Maybe.. maybe not. All I&#39;m really trying to say is we nees to ask questions and spread consciousness. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know this was not a rule for the sub, but I&#39;m just saying what I thought was fun about this subreddit a couple of years ago was talking about the &quot;what ifs&quot; about these conspiracies.</p>

<p>I stopped visiting this sub when I noticed that a majority of people posting conspiracies insisted that it was &quot;the truth&quot; and were not actually <em>discussing</em> it so much as &quot;spreading the word&quot;. </p>

<p>At some point it started to feel like people who responded should be feeding OP&#39;s delusion and not actually discus other possibilities.</p>

<p>Which is harmful two-fold. One, it&#39;s not a good way to talk about conspiracies. Two, it can keep other theories from forming based on other established theories. Seems very counterproductive.</p>

<p>I still visit from time to time, but it&#39;s not the same. I used to love just reading what people were talking about on here for hours.</p>

Well, reality beat conspiracies. People here didn&#39;t see and/or believe that the BIGGEST conspiracy since Aliens was done by Trump and Russians. If /conspiracy didn&#39;t see it, then they were incompetent.
And this sub has been heavily poisoned by Russians.
Yes it has. It is actually one of Russians favorite propaganda/disinformation form, they used it already during Cold War. 
I noticed this here first 2013. And then started to do some digging and find Alexander Dugin. He is notorious nut head BUT Putin send him to Turkey to negotiate on behalf of him.
When I&#39;ve tried to talk about this ie here, Russian bots attacked to downvote it and do ad hominem etc stuff. Then I knew I was right.</p>

<p>It isn&#39;t actually &quot;secret&quot;, if you read his stuff, it&#39;s all there. Just look at Alex Jones. </p>

<p>Remember when 80% of the stuff here was anti-Hillary? And who might have been behind that? Russian trolls have a tendency to gather special nut heads behind them, altright was not a accident.</p>

<p>So shortly: this sub was blind to the real conspiracy and people flew away. It&#39;s like you find out that your doctor is actually plumber who has fake diploma on the wall. 
Russia really killed &quot;anonymity&quot; and make it a bad word.
Oh and Snowden... there he laughs with Putin to all of you fools
and is partly shamed that his people, Americans, are so f-king easy to fool around. Education perhaps? Or good damn hipsters?</p>

<p>Anyway, anonyms talking about conspiracies doesn&#39;t sound quite healthy. And it ain&#39;t. </p>

<p>To regulars, it&#39;s pretty obvious (hence your post). My guess is that there is huge pressure with all this indictment stuff going on to drive the Russia narrative. </p>

<p>I like to believe there&#39;s some hope, reddit will die eventually as it has become unbearable due to obvious propaganda.

I&#39;ve noticed they apply the rules in a manner that benefits genuine conspiracy interested people most times though, which is cool. If you want more conspiracy content, and are sick of seeing shill/normie comments and voting, then be the change you want to see. Stick up for people in the comments, upvote stuff even if it seems pointless, and post stuff that isn&#39;t political. Rant off. For now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see these posts more often now which is great news for this sub but there&#39;s always a couple things that irk me. To imply that there is no mystery surrounding Seth Rich&#39;s death is pretty ridiculous, and it doesn&#39;t take a genius to make a correlation with his untimely, strange, unexplainable, pointless and seemingly random death with the DNC and the leaked documents. That&#39;s all I have to say about that. No one will ever know if he was murdered for leaking DNC documents, but I definitely don&#39;t think its outlandish to make that claim.</p>

<p>Secondly, if you&#39;ve been on this sub for several years, as I have, and its so obvious to you that politics are rigged in the US and that politicians are fucked up people, why is it so hard for you to consider that Seth Rich&#39;s murder may have been related to this phenomenon? Futhermore, why is the concept of pizzagate so outlandish? I mean until people started turning pizzagate into some partisan political bullshit, it was basically adding seemingly real evidence for the types of shit we were already suspecting of politicians. </p>

<p>Not really interested in debating over it, to be honest. Both of those subjects are so long gone by now that there&#39;s just no point. I just wonder why so many people keep coming here saying things like &quot;what happened to my old <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> where politicians were bad regardless of party&quot; and then in the same breath, &quot;this Seth Rich shit is such utter bullshit.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Definitely getting tired of all the labels people are throwing around. Instantly shuts down any debate and all of your opinions and everything about you is automatically assumed. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve read about pizzagate, looked at the evidence, but to me I just don&#39;t believe it since there&#39;s too many fill in the blanks and what-if arguments. I need hard evidence to believe such a thing, and a solid explanation why the authorities aren&#39;t acting on it since apparently there&#39;s so much evidence. Since that&#39;s my opinion that makes me a marxist communist lefty nutjob that only watches rachel maddow. </p>

<p>I started loving this sub before because it&#39;s a melting pot of opinions which was a good source of discussion I would read at work. Alas my American friends are so polarized it&#39;s hard to find a conversation that doesn&#39;t instantly get combative.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Completely and consistently baffling to me why people keep trying to reduce THE conspiracy of our time, unraveling and unfolding right before us, to &#39;yawn, partisan bickering, I&#39;m just so OVER it all, you know?&#39;. Or better still, &#39;that&#39;s just the narrative, mannnn, now upvote my post about how the struggling  population of honey bees in North America on Sept 11 2001 means their (((honeybee queen))) orchestrated the collapse of building 7, or I&#39;m gonna call you out as the shill you are! Why are you being so close minded, and mean, I researched it! Me! Some asshole you&#39;ve never met sourcing personal blogs you&#39;ve never heard of! Why can&#39;t I just ask questions???&#39;</p>

<p>Just say you don&#39;t care about politics, but don&#39;t try to act like it&#39;s because &#39;politics as usual&#39; are to blame. what&#39;s going down right now is historic in its scope and depth.</p>

<p>..I know you didn&#39;t ask, but what bothers me the most about Trump is the ridiculous double standards. Remember when Obama was unamerican because his radical pastor said god DAMN America with the traitorous, sinister flop sweat only a leftist preacher can produce? It&#39;s settled then, FOX news told us, Obama is clearly a commie. After all, everyone knows that you are the company you keep! </p>

<p>..Keeping that in mind, let&#39;s look behind the door marked Trump&#39;s inner circle: Russian oligarchs and the international political puppets who love them, white nationalists, foreign bank notorious for facilitating money laundering of Russian oligarchs...</p>

<p>&#39;You know what, lets not go into that&#39;, the Trumpists say, &#39;they&#39;re all deep state plants installed by Hilary clearly.&#39;</p>

<p>Which brings me to Hilary! Argh! FUCK this conniving bitch, she&#39;s always one step ahead. She can install her people around Trump, who then gain his trust, but then publicly undermine him and his GOD GIVEN authority, and make his life a living hell from the shadows. She can also have killed whoever she wants basically, and even do it personally when her urges get the best of her. But this bitch gets away with it, Every. Single. Time.</p>

<p>And then I gotta watch her sipping Chianti, laughing  at OUR PRESIDENT on the Stephen Colbert  show alongside Scottie Pippen, another guest who&#39;s just another perennially salty runner-up in his own right? It&#39;s all just too much for THIS patriot.</p>

<p>I heard this bitch can wipe the memory banks of any Republican congressmen brave, some may say foolish enough to stand up to her, killing any chance of a thorough investigation.
Shes the most ambitious, ruthless psycho in a generation, but take heart! Behold her fatal flaw. She can&#39;t rig an election for herself. She just can&#39;t do it! That&#39;s the hard limit to her power. Some say fucking with the electoral process is against her twisted personal ethical code, kinda like Dexter. Others say the actual raw patriotic, CHRIST-POWERED  democratic force the ballot booth exudes repels and weakens her. Whatever the reason, I&#39;m just relieved to tell you this bitch got a weakness.</p>

<p>I digress. Anyway Flynn, Manafort, Bannon, are all, as the Trumpists will tell you breathlessly, are obstacles to Trump&#39;s vision for america! So what they turned out to be shitty people, who really KNOWS a man anyway?</p>

<p>Tldr: Trump is great! He&#39;s just apparently the worst judge of character of all time, but man my stocks are singing a sweet song right now. MAGA</p>

<p>a lot of people with very strong political opinions/agendas come here because it allows them to say things like:</p>

<p>&quot;everyone hates &lt;insert political figure here&gt; but its really just a massive conspiracy&quot;</p>

<p>they would post these things to other subs and probably do, but those subs are even more massive echo chambers so they feel like it will give them more exposure here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just to add my two cents, it&#39;s sentiments like this that keep people from voting.  Between gerrymandering and disillusionment with the democratic process, our government will continue to fail us.</p>

<p>I have the opposite message as you (I think): Vote.  Get other people to vote.  Get involved with politics in your local community (without getting shot at if you live in a district unwelcome to this kind of stuff). For those with the time, energy, and willingness to get yelled at or worse, have discussions with people and set up booths with information.</p>

<p>Saying your vote doesnt count or that the electoral system of government is rigged DOES NOTHING for your cause.  I know so many people who said &quot;both candidates are bad&quot; and &quot;my vote doesn&#39;t matter&quot;.... and here we are!  You might not see immediate change (or maybe you will), but voting DOES matter.  Look at Virginia&#39;s last elections.  Feel free to disagree with me.  I will continue to back up this argument.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hmm. I wonder how his comment is upvoted if this sub is &quot;basically T_D.&quot; I see this time and again, over and over. Claims like this are immediately debunked by the number of upvotes, and the users don&#39;t seem to understand the contradiction. </p>

<p>I might be literally the only liberal in this entire sub who admits that this sub is <em>not</em> a Trump cirlcejerk. In most threads, the people getting upvoted in the comments are the ones speaking out against trump. The people getting upvoted are the ones saying &quot;This sub is so controlled by Trump supporters.&quot; Then how do those comments get upvoted? They usually respond by claiming it&#39;s because the thread made it to <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a>, but we see anti Trump comments at the top of threads that aren&#39;t even the top post in this sub. </p>

<p>Then we can talk about anti-Trump submissions. These do really well in this sub, which I will prove below. Guess what the excuse is? people claim the submissions were upvoted so high because they were on <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a>. Oh really? How did the post make it to <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> in the first place if this sub is &quot;controlled by Trump supporters?&quot; </p>

<p>There are a lot more than this, but this is what I could dig up from a quick search. Notice you never see anyone claim &quot;this sub is a T_D circlejerk&quot; in any of the anti-Trump threads. They just pretend these threads don&#39;t exist and continue with the anti-<a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> propaganda, which is usually heavily upvoted in here for some reason. A lot of people in here hate this sub. </p>

<p>Pay close attention to the upvote percentages. </p>

<p>&quot;Drain that Swamp: Trump&#39;s Interior Chief&#39;s Hometown Friends Receive $300 Million Contract to Restore PR Power Lines - Company Only Has 2 Employees&quot; 5,340 points, 86 percent upvoted: <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/78ffzd/drain_that_swamp_trumps_interior_chiefs_hometown/">https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/78ffzd/drain_that_swamp_trumps_interior_chiefs_hometown/</a></p>

<p>If you check the comments of supposedly &quot;pro-Trump&quot; posts, anti-Trump comments reign supreme. There&#39;s nothing really wrong with that, but the people claiming this sub is one giant pro-Trump conspiracy are deluding themselves. Some people try to claim all of this is explained because this or that post hit <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a>, but that&#39;s complete bullshit. Posts that don&#39;t hit <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> are also very anti-Trump in the comments. Anti-Trump posts also couldn&#39;t hit <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> in the first place if they weren&#39;t heavily upvoted in this sub before they reached <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a>. </p>

<p>&quot;Dear T_D readers, Please read this post. <strong>I am ready for your downvotes.</strong> If you are a trump supporter who also visits this sub, here is a message for you.

<p>There are also a lot of posts that say &quot;Fuck both sides.&quot; Examples:</p>

<p>To the people who claim anti-Trump comments can be explained because some threads in this sub make it to <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a>, I&#39;ll show you a thread that is below a 1000 with anti-Trump comments. In fact, many of the posts above never made it to <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a>, but to be conservative, I&#39;ll keep the threshold under a 1000 to guarantee that <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> regulars are the ones making and upvoting these comments. </p>

<p>Check out the top comment on this 755 upvote anti-Trump post: <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/76qr7j/just_a_friendly_reminder_that_trumps_labor/">https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/76qr7j/just_a_friendly_reminder_that_trumps_labor/</a></p>

<p>&quot;Sorry, wrong party. Won&#39;t get traction. Change the name trump to Hillary to get the conspiracy community to take notice&quot;</p>

<p>Also just pay more attention to the upvotes/downvotes in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> threads from now on.  Pay attention to that  and the propaganda just doesn&#39;t make any sense anymore. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s the thing, I&#39;m a very <strong>very</strong> anti-Hillary person. I&#39;m also a very <strong>very</strong> anti-Trump. I find myself more at odds with the Hillary supporters though because for all the talk about how bad Trump supporters are, I see an incredible number of Hillary supporters acting worse. I see them far more than I see Trump supporters. That wouldn&#39;t even be a big deal if it weren&#39;t accompanied by them talking non-stop about Trump circle jerks and how Reddit hates minorities and women. Reddit is by and large a very liberal place. As a centerist who leans slightly more left than right, it would even work for me. But the constant act as if they are under attack for seeing an opinion that differs is infuriating. Then you glance at the votes, and they are upvoted while dissenting opinions are downvoted into oblivion. There is basically a demand for confirmation bias, and an almost total lack of self awareness politically, and while neither side is immune or remotely free of it, the left here on Reddit seems to really be championing that cause. </p>

<p>The hope would be that we could understand that political affiliations ultimately don&#39;t matter in a sub like this. People should understand that neither their nor the opposition&#39;s party is good or trustworthy, but instead we get a constant cycle of both attacking the other side while defending something that is ultimately indefensible. It almost seems that we are at a saturation point with partisanship.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So why isn&#39;t there a conspiracy that both Hillary and Trump are garbage? Why does one just &quot;have&quot; to be the &quot;good guy&quot;? </p>

<p>Hillary is corrupt, therefore Trump is not? It seems odd for this subreddit to blindly trust any person with as much power as a president.</p>

<p>You cannot do that in ANY sub dedicated to any subject. This concept is so simple that a kindergarten kid could understand it.</p>

<p>Point is, there aren&#39;t rules about down voting just because the users history or you disagree with what they said. The point of down voting was always to encourage higher quality commentary to be at the top of the page. That can&#39;t exist when armies from either side just go on the attack without wanting to actually engage the other person.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can understand that point of view, but I think attempting to assassinate the President carries great risk and could even potentially expose the NWO to the general public. Perhaps they see that as a last resort and would rather try to conrol him, contain him, impeach him, or otherwise suppress him first. Or maybe he really is just another puppet, but I find that hard to believe based on the leaked emails and other thing.</p>

<p>I was simply providing a little context to the comment I was replying to.  I did not start a political argument, if that was the goal, I would have made a top level comment and I would not have mentioned anything about CIA or JTRIG.  You went off the rails with this &quot;political argument&quot;.  Sorry man, unless someone else here chimes in, I&#39;m done replying.</p>
