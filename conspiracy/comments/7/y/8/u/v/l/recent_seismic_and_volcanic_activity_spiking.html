<p>I watch this religiously. </p>

<p>We have had a HUGE lack of sunspots recently. </p>

<p>Sunspots seem to be magnetic phenomena that has something to do with the magnetic birkeland current ropes that connect the sun and various planets in our solar system. (No one up to date on the electric universe is probably completely unaware of what I speak of)</p>

<p>It is possible this has caused a weakening of our magnetic field, which may give it the fuel to flip, as its possible these currents keep the magnetic field in some type of equilibrium (my theory).</p>

<p>Yes though, we were recently directly hit by a small CME from AR2699 which is about to vanish from our view. </p>

<p>With the electric universe information coming out, the sun is a big confusing mess to me. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think we&#39;re in the GOD universe.  Like, the main one.  There&#39;s probably many others, but they all route through this one.  I think Earth is basically Midland, which is funny because someone just stated in a related discussion that I was having that they were Nordic Pagan.  Anyhow, I was in that thread talking about Lucifer and someone else  went on a little rant about how Jesus (or Lucifer according to them) was meant to snare the elect (apparently the <em>real</em> Jewish people), who are gods.  </p>

<p>Now, I don&#39;t know if you are aware of the jubliee idea in Judaism, but it is high time that the Jews release their debtors.  They cannot pretend to uphold their laws in exactitude if they do not follow one of the most important ideas.  The jubilee was a huge celebration historically.</p>

<p>I think that humans are meant for much more in this universe and beyond, and rather more quickly than not.  And there are certainly stories of mankind being assisted in the past, and it looks likes we&#39;re in line for that again.  I saw a UFO when I was four.  I have no doubt they are keeping tabs on us, and it may be basically like Kaku says in that humankind may have to be a bit more united before real contact occurs.  As in not having people directly in power that are intent on holding back humanity.  Humans are <em>like</em> gods, and perhaps we do become gods after death.  But I have a feeling it&#39;s deeper than that.  I actually think things are gathering on or around Earth.  Onamuamua may have been a precursor of sorts.  But it&#39;s more than that.  Humans themselves may not be all they seem.  MKUltra aside, I think there is a real possibility that angels and demons inhabit people, but gods and goddesses do as well.  Greek and Roman mythology is replete with gods chasing humans, but it makes more sense if they are humans with the souls of gods.</p>

<p>I could keep going, but last year being 5777 in the Jewish calendar and the director of the IMF&#39;s speech on magic 7&#39;s were kinda the icing on the cake.  And all the weirdness.  Lotta weirdness these days. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, that&#39;s why this age is interesting, because with information we get to really see who is on who&#39;s &quot;side&quot;, in a way.  Funny how fame and/or the search for it may be one of the things that sets the baddies apart.  If you&#39;ve ever looked at old magicians&#39; posters, many used to credit the devil or satan (so much so that it was in every poster).  David Blaine even has.  It may be compulsive, like the Azazel reference in the recent Justin Timberlake video.  It&#39;s fascinating to me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry if I am ramblling...I am the middle word of your screenname...as always.  :)</p>

<p>But anyhow, I haven&#39;t told ya the half of it...I&#39;ve had some unbelieveable things happen, both in my past and in the past year and half.  Things are getting fo&#39; real.  It&#39;ll be quite interesting if things pan out how I think they will.  If you were God, wouldn&#39;t you want things to turn out the best for most people?</p>

<p>And if it were me, I suppose so, but I’m not God so I really can’t say for certain how I’d feel in that position</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Everyone forgot about the Brown Dwarf Nemesis. We are passing it in April/May. Possible full polar shift. Real SHTF stuff.</p>

<p>Memba nasa finding a Brown Dwarf star system with 7 planets..they said several light years away but the cake was a lie...its in our system. Caused Saturn to turn on it&#39;s side a few years ago or maybe even last year.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hope someone sees this and tells me they know the video - but I came across a video about two years or so ago and it talked about how volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, solar flares etc aren’t random and he uses NASA data to prove it. it was wild. i think this has a lot to do with that </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The poles are absolutely shifting, it&#39;s only a matter of time before the full switch happens. Because of the pole shift we also losing our magnetosphere. We are also entering into a grand solar minimum, some are even predicting a mini ice age type event. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey, no one is saying that figures like Baal wouldn&#39;t have to kowtow to God, if they were real.  Or, maybe invocation isn&#39;t an absolute thing.  And maybe if you worship another &quot;god&quot;, you are automatically cast into Satan&#39;s lot.  Actually, that makes a lotta sense.  </p>
