    <div class="md"><p>He was around 74 with adult children and 4 grandchildren.</p>

<p>No to everything. None of the Bohemian Grove type shit. He was self made from nothing. I don&#39;t know if new money goes to bilderburg or things like that.</p>

<p>When Bill C was president he had a special bullet/bomb proof Mercedes made so they could hang out without &quot;protection&quot; following them. He was apparently pretty good friends with him. No idea what they were doing, I wasn&#39;t around at that time. I know he had a couple meetings every year with Trump too. Business talk I would guess. My boss thought DT was too &quot;showtime&quot;, he never turned off.</p>

<p>When Jay Z and Beyonce had their honeymoon ,they stayed in my bosses Arizona house. He was friends with Jay Z, had his cell and would call sometimes. He was friends with Michael Jordan too.</p>

<p>Is this boring? Should I continue?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My in-laws are good friends with an almost billionaire.   They fly (their own private jet of course) to Napals, FL every winter and my wife and I keep an eye out of their house.  Obviously they don&#39;t trust many people free roaming their house while they are out of state.  We mainly get things in order for Christmas celebrations so they can fly in for Christmas and fly right back out.   But this process can take weeks because of all the rooms and etc need to be decorated.</p>

<p>It&#39;s pretty nutty.   The husband is in insurance and insures a lot of commercial properties like big box stores in the area.   I&#39;ve seen well over a million dollars worth of checks sitting on his desk written to him.   He owns tons of property, like commercial multifloor strip malls and a few of these have cellphone towers on top of that he just banks because the company pays for those towers to be on his buildings/property.</p>

<p>The amazing thing is, their house 2.8ish million dollars is pretty humble because he has about 10x that spent on art.   Every room even bathrooms have some hand painted 18th century art in them.</p>

<p>Oh and that&#39;s just 1 of the 2 houses, they&#39;ve invited us down to their Florida house, but I never had the vacation to go.   My inlaws says it makes their home house seem small.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is pretty nutty. It&#39;s nice to see that they are generous with you and trusted you, very cool.</p>

<p>My old boss died a few years ago when his private jet crashed during take off, killing everyone.  I knew 4 of the 7 on board. Absolutely tragic. He had personal pilots and his jet was their only responsibly. The crash was from pilot error. Fucking lazy assholes got everyone killed.</p>

<p>Anyway,  he owned an entire beach block with 3 houses in a South Jersey seasonal Beach town. He owned 3 apartments in Philly at the Rittenhouse hotel. A completely remodeled penthouse in Manhattan. It was amazing. He had 4 apartments in Boca Raton and he owned an incredible house in Scottsdale.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m an East coast guy. Point is, I did see a couple snakes and tan away like a bitch. Didn&#39;t hear any rattling though. One night a pack of wolves snuck up on me and got within 30ft or so. Really cool but I was happy when I got inside.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very strange that it&#39;s in this sub that OPs like this keep getting uncritically and unintelligently ridiculed.  Of all places - a sub that&#39;s supposed to be open to perspectives that are not the norm.  Get a chance to communicate with someone who might actually have some inside knowledge, and many users in here turn into uncritical trolls.  A shame really.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The point is that from my perspective whenever someone that is rich is mentioned this sub starts frothing at the mouth. </p>

<p>He&#39;s a greedy fucking reptilian, he&#39;s a pedo, he&#39;s gotta be a freemason or sacrificing children and drinking their blood. Shit like that. Doesn&#39;t happen every time but there seems to be an assumption of questionable or dark behavior.</p>

<p>My post is to let people know that there are really good moral filthy rich people. My old boss was one of them. In one year alone, he donated over $50 mil to 2 Universities to build new science and law labs. He built 2 boys and girls clubs in really bad neighborhoods to get young kids off the streets. One time we were in the mall and a group of 7 or 8 young, underprivileged kids started talking to him. He found out they were a basketball team from a poor city. Long story short he ended up buying them new uniforms and new sneakers for the whole team.  He was generous and thoughtful. I&#39;ll stop here but people should know that being wealthy doesn&#39;t mean you traded your morals and character to obtain the money.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s fair. Maybe it&#39;s just how I interpreted things. I just happen to see these blanket statements about particular groups and it&#39;s annoying because there&#39;s always exceptions. But anyway, ill leave it at that..</p>
