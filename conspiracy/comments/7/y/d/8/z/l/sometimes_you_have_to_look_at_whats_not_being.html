    <div class="md"><p>This garbage isn’t even being reported by the alternative media. Alex Jones is supposed to be the guy that comes through for us and reports on things like this, but he has completely failed and exposed the fact that he is controlled by the same people who control the mainstream media. </p>

<p>The USA controls a lot of land and a lot of oil field in Syria, so the idea that they will withdraw their troops is absolutely ridiculous. I really don’t know if Assad is controlled or not, I worry about his connection with Putin and Russia. But I think it’s good to see that the US funded rebels are being pushed back a little bit by Assad’s Forces. It’s about time the US doesn’t get their way. </p>

<p>So..yeah, I agree..all in all its about time the US doesn&#39;t get it&#39;s way on this...latest I&#39;ve heard is that they are stating up a 10 year occupation plan in Syria...the insanity needs to stop.</p>

<p>Watch the brilliant Charlie Brooker&#39;s:&quot; <em>Year number</em> Wipe &quot; (any year). He is a writer/comedian and the creator of the awesome Black Mirror series too but he sees the BS and news wipe series whilst completely satire shows how obvious the MSM is when it comes to theatre. </p>

<p>The Yearly wipes are the best as you can see the agenda for the year unfold as he presents the nonsense going on in a dry satirical way but yet shows you how obvious it all is when you are awakened to it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, and BellingCat is about as biased of a source as you can get. Newsweek isn&#39;t much better, but they do have better reporting <em>in comparison</em>. </p>

<p>Example of BC&#39;s dubious reporting is <a href="https://consortiumnews.com/2015/10/20/mh-17-case-old-journalism-vs-new/">its involvement in the MH17 disaster.</a></p>

<p>Assad has no - absolutely zero, zilch, nada - reason to orchestrate these gas attacks. Let&#39;s get the narrative straight. Assad, who is winning the war and reclaiming territories seized by extremists, crosses the only red line established by the West, gassing <em>random civilians</em>, not even a military target, guaranteeing his downfall. Not only that he uses chlorine gas, which is  one of the most ineffective weapons he could have used. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, a few thing:</p>

<p>1) The sources I linked are not lacking. Consortium in particular has a history of fact-based reporting. </p>

<p>2) Thank you for being open-minded.</p>

<p>3) Another example: BellingCat <a href="https://www.bellingcat.com/news/mena/2016/12/14/bana-alabed-verification-using-open-source-information/">published a &quot;fact check&quot;</a> on the psy-op twitter account for Bana Alabed. This twitter account has long since been outed as a propaganda account. Alabed&#39;s family ALL have ties to Al-Nusra, and ALL of the pictures taken of her were at terrorist-held strongholds. <a href="https://www.corbettreport.com/eva-bartlett-exposes-the-lies-on-syria/">Here</a> is an interview with Eva Bartlett on the Corbett Report. She&#39;s an excellent investigative journalist who has been to Syria dozens of times. <a href="http://ingaza.wordpress.com/">Here</a> is her blog.</p>

<p>4) Yes, Corbett Report is very, very, credible. Don&#39;t take my word for it though, check out some of his other work, like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vNwe7yKbwo">this segment on the White Helmets.</a> His Big Oil documentaries are incredible as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>welcome to the beauracracy of war? it&#39;s only okay to gas civilians using certified approved nerve gas.</p>

<p>similarly, some bombs are allowed, while others are not. if the end result is destruction and death, what&#39;s the difference between a cluster bomb and a targeted strike?  collateral damage, i guess?</p>

<p>as far as sarin vs chlorine, maybe it&#39;s the difference between a quick and painless gassing death vs a tortuous and painful gassing death?</p>

<p>That bombing run was a trick, medias fell for it and some even called Trump presidential when there were calling for his impeachments minutes before. It was a trick because you don&#39;t warn your enemy when you are going to bomb him, also when you do bomb him, you take shit out, the base was operational hours after the bombing run... </p>

Accuse dictator of human rights abuses, ethnic cleansing, genocide, or whatever is focus-grouping well.
Deploy lots of NGO &#39;human rights observers&#39;.
Twitter up some mass protests.

    <div class="md"><p>Mattie’s statement was in specific reference to a recent series of alleged Sarin gas attacks, not the earlier gas attacks the US retaliated to. </p>

<p>His comments, taken out of context, do not specify that. They only say “no evidence he’s seen of gas attacks”. That’s why it isn’t being heavily reported. Context matters.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are correct..I just spent some time going through his actual statement...</p>

<p>That being said...I have still seen no solid evidence given by the OPCW or have I seen a statement by the JIM from the UN that proves Assad used Sarin at Khan Sheikhoun in April of 2017....</p>

<p>So...I admit to suffering from a bit of confirmation bias...</p>

<p>Regardless...the whole point of this post has been rendered pointless and inaccurate concerning Mattis statement.</p>
