        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The title is self explanatory. Throughout the history other countries have been participating in the game of prisoners dilemma and the goal is to subvert each other all the time. This time it&#39;s the US. Other times US subverted others. It&#39;s a game we all have to play and those who don&#39;t play the game will lose to those who do. Period.</p>

<p>Take a long look at yourselves, your friends, and your family, because you might be a part of the problem. Ask yourself - why is it so easy to subvert us? The answer is quite simple really - lack of common identity. Before that we had a common king, a common religion, a common national identity. Now we don&#39;t have kings, religion is being pushed away by science, which, ironically, is a new religion, and you&#39;re not allowed to be a nationalist because you&#39;re literally Hitler if you do that. People don&#39;t have other options other than forming smaller groups which inevitably will fight among themselves. This is what people do. However, the more groups you have throughout the nation, the harder it is to rally people together and the easier it is for others to give funding to those groups to empower them. For fucks sake, ex KGB agents and spies have been openly talking about this very scheme for quite some time. They even emphasize the importance of empowering groups that don&#39;t have any truths behind their ideologies and how they&#39;ll win. &quot;Nah, we&#39;re different and can&#39;t be subverted.&quot; Sure, sure...</p>

<p>Please, take your time and read one of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7xxlnf/in_the_posttruth_age_the_way_to_the_truth_is_by/">my previous comments about the meaning of truth</a> from the perspective of a PR person.</p>

<p>Edit: Alright, this post got in to the hot news. I need to clarify one thing. I am not saying Russians were able to get Trump elected with a few ads. I am also not saying they aren&#39;t directly or indirectly doing that. What I am saying is that this is a systemic problem and Hillary, Trump, whoever are just actors that don&#39;t matter that much. It&#39;s a systemic problem created by different actors with the purpose of causing fragmentation of the society. This strategy is much  older than Trump or Hillary and hasn&#39;t changed a lot since them. The same principles were adjusted to make them work on different platforms.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Socratic method of teaching focuses on asking questions and ask the teacher guiding the discussion but allow students to try to work out the answers.</p>

<p>Truth be told the push for common core not long ago had a stronger focus on critical thinking as well, but people went apeshit over it because of how fast it was rolled out and the last generation had the idea that “I memorized times tables and it worked great for me, I don’t understand why they can’t just do that”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sadly,  most are :( but I take the same stance as you here.  When you begin to see that your own government, religion,  news,  and other ways to find information for the normal person are lying to their people,  or letting them believe lies,  you (or sorry I don&#39;t mean to assume I know how you feel towards it all) rather I just see how the general population is getting Fucked, how they not only don&#39;t see it but smile and ask for it harder! And once I see how fucking stupid  people are and there&#39;s no changing or fixing them,  I realize there&#39;s no reason stressing about them,  and just focus on living  my own life and improving that and things I have control over! :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I teach kindergarten. When my kids ask me a tough question (that&#39;s not directly related to a specific activity we&#39;re working on), I ask them what they think the answer is. Then I ask them how we would be able to test that idea and if possible I&#39;ll help them create an activity based on the concept they were interested in. I try not to just explain concepts to them because that way I can help them keep their curiosity, creativity and help them improve their self confidence by giving them the opportunity to basically guide their own education.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is literally a thread about how problem solving should be taught more/is important.</p>

<p>The firsr guy said the most important thing to know in IT is how to Google something (which is half joke, half truth). </p>

<p>Then some 14 year old comes in with his &quot;Google makes you dumb, searching for answers to problems is dumb&quot; meme when that&#39;s not even what the original thread was about. It&#39;s about problem solving in the 21st century. No shit I&#39;m going to Google something when I have a problem that I can&#39;t solve on my own, that is literally problem solving skills.</p>

<p>I agree that the fact that we have the wealth of human knowledge at our fingertips may (in some cases) cause people to have shorter memories, and it definitely killed off oral traditions and myths of the past etc. That isn&#39;t necessarily an inherently negative thing though, and the benefits of having all of human knowledge able to be found in seconds far outweighs any perceived negativity.</p>

<p>But that&#39;s just, like, my opinion. You can feel free to disagree I guess. </p>

Let&#39;s say Bob&#39;s toilet is leaking. Instead of checking the inside and experimenting on it, he jumps right to eHow and follows the guide to the letter. So he demonstrates comprehension, but not problem solving, if that makes any sense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, totally does. I see your point. What people are essentially saying (as far as I see from the chain of comments) is that this example is problem solving in itself. It&#39;s just easier to do it nowadays. Basically why ignore everything that tech brought us and live in stone age, while you can be super productive utilising all the tech around us. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s be fair, if google is gone, there&#39;s probably something very wrong with the world and you don&#39;t need the skill to clean the toilet, you need the skills to gather food and survive. This is a very different beast that we need to tackle. </p>

<p>The point I was trying to make myself is that critical thinking is even more basic, it impacts comprehension, allows people to discern truth from lies (even in case of a corrupted source of information) etc., hence in my view extremely important. </p>

Needles points out that propaganda is not new, but the power of social media is. SM pushes dialogue into &quot;thumbs up/thumbs down&quot; dichotomy which bifurcates the population and doesn&#39;t allow for a middle ground. Furthermore, because the propaganda is spread by &quot;friends&quot; instead of MSM there is increased pressure to assimilate in-group norms.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying social media is definitely more powerful than old forms of propaganda but I think there are reasons to believe it could be.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What do you think that looks like? Have you been to public school recently? The current model is to teach people &quot;how to think for themselves&quot;. Every class that involves any writing has &quot;critical thinking questions&quot;. Yet there is always a correct answer. Teachers have the ability to subjectively snuff out the opinions they don&#39;t agree with by labeling it bad analysis. </p>

<p>Part of critical thinking involves questioning everything. All of our assumptions need to be critically examined. By its very nature, the education system we have set up is designed to do the opposite. One of the reasons I am very pro private schooling, homeschooling, and alternative schooling like Montessori. </p>

<p>The truth is that most people do NOT want to critically think. They want the easy path out. They want their ipod and facebook feed. As long as they are comfortable that will be enough for them to believe whatever is most convenient. </p>

Your have the overloud loony left ( and i mean the nutters not anyone that is left leaning as am I) Shutting down debate in universities, screaming down people that have a different viewpoint than them and marking anyone on the right as some sort of jackboot wearing thugs.

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, the divide is apparent and is becoming more serious. However, the problem I have with current approach of solving this problem is linked to not understanding the systemic problem and focusing on bullshit news, false accusations, and secret sources that are crafted to undermine small groups of individuals. Again, look at one of my posts I&#39;ve mentioned in this post. It makes much more financial sense to sell lies in large quantities rather than selling truth in small quantities. Note that I&#39;m talking about short term, not long term. In the long term such strategy will collapse in on itself. It&#39;s all about the short term paper profits mandated by the law. The law itself is a scapegoat and it&#39;s beautifully fulfilling its intended cause.</p>

<p>Martin Shkreli is a prime example of the problem I&#39;ve just outlined. He was maximizing profits for his shareholders when he could do so. If we wouldn&#39;t have done that and shareholders would&#39;ve found out about it, he could have been held liable for essentially not being a team player and not following the law. Sure, he had other problems which is why he&#39;s in his current position.</p>

<p>People should stop focusing on the divide and don&#39;t fix individual cases. They should focus on fixing the systemic problem which requires reducing the amount of groups existing in the society. I&#39;m not advocating creating a uniform society but rather having a few rather large groups of people. Some groups of people should be told to shut up and join one of the existing teams. No one cares about your transgender lesbian cat owner society.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you really believe the election was subverted by a dozen Russians on a very small budget? How embarrassing.</p>

<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/01/russian-facebook-ad-spend/">Trump and Clinton both spent $81,000,000 on Facebook advertising combined</a>, and that&#39;s just Facebook alone.</p>

<p>Many world leaders tried to <a href="https://twitter.com/Alwaleed_Talal/status/675390247165915137">directly interfere</a> in the election and got praised by US citizens for doing so.</p>

<p>You are now playing right in to the hands of &quot;the Russians&quot; by making it seem like they had a large impact on the election, and that it was only them attempting to influence people. They are loving this right now, because this is what they wanted all along.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t buy it either, because it&#39;s absolutely absurd. The people promoting this type of thinking are basically doing the Russians work for them now, long after their funding dried up.</p>

<p>After the collusion myth failed, the new thing is that we&#39;re supposed to believe the Russians set up a system that effectively countered the voices of 90% of the US media and Hollywood, as well countering hundreds of millions of dollars in campaign funds... with what? A million dollars or so, and a dozen people? Give me a break.</p>

<p>Genuine question, what are those falsities?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The parts of the Clinton-Steele dossier about Michael Cohen (one of Trump&#39;s lawyers) being in Prague, and everything that stems from that, are false. It was a case of <a href="https://twitter.com/jaketapper/status/819187673961287681">mistaken identity</a>.</p>

<p>The parts about Carter Page are very likely to be false. And those parts make up a large portion of the collusion claims.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Claims:</strong> One of the more significant reports, it again asserts that Page met with Rosneft chief executive Sechin in July. At the meeting, Sechin offered [Carter] Page and Trump a 19 percent stake in Rosneft in exchange for lifting sanctions on Russia if elected.</p>

<p>It also asserts that <strong>Cohen</strong>, Trump’s lawyer, was playing a “key role” in the Russia-Trump relationship.</p>

<p><strong>Analysis:</strong> The Rosneft claim received a lot of attention when, in January, a 19.5 percent stake in the company was sold to an unknown buyer. Later reporting, though, indicated that the buyers were companies based in Qatar and Switzerland. It was essentially a loan, and Moscow prearranged to buy back some of the company from the Qataris.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2017/10/25/what-the-trump-dossier-says-and-what-it-doesnt/">https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2017/10/25/what-the-trump-dossier-says-and-what-it-doesnt/</a></p>

<p>WaPo calls this &quot;one of the more significant reports&quot; from the dossier. So, one of the more significant reports from the dossier has been debunked already.</p>

<p>The Clinton-Steele dossier relies heavily on Carter Page to make the collusion claims, and none of it holds up.</p>

<p>Russians you&#39;ve mentioned are just the ones who supposedly got caught. The extent is far more significant and goes well beyond campaign financing. I&#39;m talking about a systemic problem, while you&#39;re focusing on a rather small problem.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Apparently it&#39;s the internet research &quot;agency&quot; and not &quot;institute&quot; fyi. Here&#39;s the only place the indictment mentions the organization&#39;s size afaik:</p>

<p>The ORGANIZATION employed hundreds of individuals for its online operations, ranging from creators of fictitious personas to technical and administrative support. The ORGANIZATION’s annual budget totaled the equivalent of millions of U.S. dollars. </p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Research_Agency">It&#39;s wikipedia page</a> is pretty sparse but says:</p>

<p>The indictment doesn&#39;t mention how many people worked for the next two entities &quot;Concord Management and Consulting&quot; and &quot;Concord Catering&quot; but they&#39;re connected and (if I&#39;m reading this correctly) they had a combined monthly operating budget of $1.25 million.

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks.</p>

<p>I wonder why they weren&#39;t all indicted. It&#39;s not like anyone involved will ever be convicted anyway, since they&#39;d have to voluntarily visit the US. They&#39;re not going to be extradited.</p>

<p>It&#39;s still a fairly small budget, considering what they were up against. And that&#39;s even if they were all working on the US side of things the whole time, which is doubtful. Aren&#39;t we told that they&#39;ve been trying this all over Europe and elsewhere?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What do you mean by all? The individual employees working at these agencies? I&#39;d assume it&#39;s impossible to determine their identities and tie each with evidence toward this effort rather than go after the agencies as a whole instead (as well as a select few who took prominent roles and even traveled to the US, ie the 13 named). You&#39;re right they won&#39;t but extridited, the indictments are instead meant to 1. inform the US public of Russia&#39;s activites 2. Limit these people&#39;s ability to travel and whatnot and 3. send a very clear message to Russia that we know what they did and how they did it with enough confidence to put forth criminal charges. </p>

<p>And yea it&#39;s impossible to know the impact of Russia&#39;s efforts, not least of all because presidential elections are extremely multicausal. But 1 million a month stretches a lot further when you&#39;re focusing almost exclusively on online efforts. Comparing it to Hillary or Trump&#39;s campaign for instance doesn&#39;t work considering the majority of their money is going to TV ads (and a much lesser extent mail, radio). Further, all the stuff they promoted already played into the narrative of one campaign or another. If you put a fake news story about clinton out there, Trump or Bernie supporters might run with it and do a lot of the actual leg work spreading it on social media.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, all good points. However, if they can&#39;t ID each person and tie them to US election interference, then where did the 1,000 number come from? This is what I mean about exaggerating the effect they had.</p>

<p>Also, see my edit about the Wiki reference (CNN article). They were using this budget to fund multiple projects. Probably some &quot;PR work&quot; for Russian involvement in Syria / Ukraine mixed in there? And whatever else we&#39;ve been told they were doing around EU and elsewhere.</p>

<p>And on a related note, go and check out the Jill Stein trend on Twitter that&#39;s happening right now: <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%22Jill%20Stein%22&amp;amp;src=tren">https://twitter.com/search?q=%22Jill%20Stein%22&amp;amp;src=tren</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Might be why the indictment cites hundreds of people rather than the thousand plus from the CNN article, it doesnt actually provide the intel it&#39;s basing it&#39;s claims off of so im not sure how they came to that number.

<blockquote>
<p>A lot of Russian conservatives were proud. They said: “Look at what Russians can do! Only 90 people with $2 million made America scared! We are strong!” And for conservative people here, they see that Americans have CNN, Radio Free Europe, etc., that cover Russia. They say, “Why can’t we establish groups in America and have our own influence?” That&#39;s how conservative people think here. They think this was normal.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t know much about this Russian journalist, but they&#39;re saying he&#39;s one of the two who helped uncover the election meddling. He says 90 people were involved and $2m was spent, but he says it in more of a joking way I think... and sort of paraphrasing what other people say.</p>

<p>Take from that what you will... but in any event, the Russians are enjoying the way this is being represented by US media. That&#39;s for sure.</p>

As much as I believe Trump to be a master manipulator I 100% believe she was worse. I think the Russian&#39;s intended aim was to cause strife between Americans. And to be honest I think the MSM has played right into that. They are the ones I hold responsible for the fractured state of our nation. Russia only did what many, many other organizations were doing. The media however has a personal axe to grind. And they&#39;ve been doing it non stop since 2016. I know the constant barrage on all things Trump related flipped me. It was entirely too much. Just like this Russia shit&#39;s been. Too fucking much. Critical thinking is important. Everyone should be aware that there is a legit propaganda war going on right now. Everything we see and hear someone wanted us to see and hear. And the louder that message is, the more skeptical of it you should be. And it&#39;s not only Russia behind those messages.</p>

<p>Shitposting has to do with the quality of individual posts. There is nothing you quoted from the indictment -- or in the indictment itself -- that supports your claim they were just &quot;shitposting.&quot;</p>

<p>They were running an operation that had tens of thousands of fake accounts operated by hundreds of real live employees. It was just one part of the much larger Russian operation. It is not comparable to anything done in previous elections, nor anything done by other countries. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Our laws do apply to acts that they do that effect us.  We most certainly can indict them.  If one of them was to step foot into our country they would be arrested.  And they weren&#39;t just saying &quot;Hillary is evil.&quot;  There were posts about her sacrificing children and killing people.  When you couple that with the stated intention of &quot;we are going to post shit online with the intention of hurting her chances at winning the Presidency&quot; you have evidence that they were knowingly lying with the expressed intent of hurting her chances of winning.  Again, even the White House who read the indictment and got to see where the evidence came from and what was actually being done now agrees &quot;Yep... they should be indicted and what they did was illegal and we can&#39;t let this happen again.&quot;  </p>

<p>And where am I acting like they can&#39;t buy ads?  They can buy ads but if they are buying ads that are knowingly false and defamatory that is illegal in the US and they would have to face the consequences of that if they were to come to America.  And now Trump is going to be forced to deal with Russia and either ask for them to be turned over to face the charges or to act like he doesn&#39;t care about it even after he now admitted that they did meddle in the election.  </p>

These types of things aren&#39;t new; otherwise every political attack ad would be a smoking gun that completely tanks a candidate&#39;s campaign (rarely happens, because most of us are aware that the ad is nowhere near the true story). Similar to the Wikileaks releases - the problem with that isn&#39;t that our freedom of election was being subverted from the inside, but <strong><em>that it was being exposed</em></strong>. If our government agencies had discovered that France&#39;s elections were a sham and revealed that information to the French public we&#39;d never stop jerking ourselves off over it. </p>

<p>Our outrage is being deflected towards the lesser parts of the issue rather than the root of the problems - our highest levels of government are swamped with corruption and money is the only thing that talks. Their goal was to sow discord, which is why they funded pro-Trump stuff, anti-Trump stuff, racially divisive (BLM-esque) stuff, and various protests. It is why they have been aiming to subvert the presidency post-election. They&#39;re cutting into our media&#39;s action and that&#39;s why our media is unhappy about it.</p>

Of course not.  He&#39;d be saying &quot;This is just another stage of the witch hunt by the FBI!!&quot;  Instead of that he is now having to admit that there&#39;s something there.

And why would they troll in a way that was specifically targeted to hurt on candidate and help another?  That sounds like that trolling had an intended purpose.

<p>That&#39;s the truth. I would add Fox though as well. ALL of MSM is spinning and pushing a narrative. If your only getting your information from a left leaning/right leaning site your not getting the full picture. I think it&#39;s incredibly important to try to be objective about this shit. There really is a propaganda war being waged and to get to the truth you really have to dig. But it is out there. It&#39;s our responsibility to listen to folks who have a different take than the one were already inclined to believe. Does that make sense? I just think its far too easy to read and listen to folks who have the same worldview. I think that&#39;s a good chunk of the reason we&#39;re in this mess today.</p>

<p>Echo chambers are real and only serve to reaffirm what you already believe but it does nothing to advance the truth. We&#39;ve got to be diligent these days. You&#39;d think with all of the 24/7 news channels and the internet it would be a piece of cake to see what the actual truth is. But that&#39;s just not the case. Both sides keep us so wound the fuck up we can&#39;t see straight. I appreciate forums like these where I&#39;m able to discuss things with folks, but even this sub has been overrun with shills/bots. Although I haven&#39;t been subscribed for too long I have absolutely noticed the shift as of late. So I know when I&#39;m seeing ideas and opinions being down voted what the actual deal is. For cats who haven&#39;t been here, it&#39;s rather unfortunate that they believe this is how people in this sub believe. It makes it more difficult for them to discern the truth from the spin. And while I believe that the entire Russia narrative that has been spun is nothing more than a way for people to censor and suppress conservative viewpoints, I hope the biggest take away for Americans is that shills/bots exist. And they are coming from EVERYWHERE.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I followed the election very closely - before and after the primaries. Fox News was not monolithic on Trump before the primaries: different hosts and guests had different opinions. And like a lot of the right, there was a little bit of fear getting too close to Trump because until Trump proved you could be an openly racist bigot and hatemonger, people thought it was backfire. Once he proved how well it worked, the right rallied around Trump -- in fact, they fell in love with him. He&#39;s the new Reagan. They would trample Reagan into the dirt to shake Trump&#39;s hand if they had a chance. Now the right is all, &quot;Reagan who?&quot;</p>

<p>But even during the primaries there was a lot of support for Trump on Fox News -- more than any other candidate. And of course once he secured the nomination, Fox News became what it is today: The Trump Network. </p>

<p>While support is great, all you need is a solid business idea that is based on the real world needs not your wants and ideas of how things should be done. Another problem many businesses have are razor thin margins. You don&#39;t want to be in that place if you find a proper target audience and make a great value proposition.</p>

<p>I think a lot of folks just don&#39;t want to believe that Clinton lost because she sucked. That&#39;s the only conclusion I can come too. I know she wrote an entire book about how it wasn&#39;t her fault. Thy doth protest too much. She had over a billion dollars at her disposal. Companies like Google rearranging search results. Companies like ShareBlue and Correct The Record doing the exact same thing Russia has been accused of.</p>

<p>And something else that is being completely overlooked, this is an indictment. It&#39;s not a guilty conviction. And more likely than not those cats will never be extradited, therefore there will never be a trial. We will never see their point of view or evidence contradicting the accusation. It&#39;s amazing to me how in this day in age people are so quick to presume guilt just because someone tosses out an accusation. It&#39;s entirely too convenient. Innocent until proven guilty is dead in this country.</p>

The problem is that aggressive campaigning <em>does</em> work.  Swift-boating, smearing, and generally rallying does indeed work, which is why political operatives do it.</p>

<p>&quot;I truly believe Hillary lost because she was an awful candidate to begin with.&quot;  That is certainly part of why she lost -- she was a terrible candidate for many reasons, one of which was a three-decade-long hate campaign.  Nevertheless, her loss was an upset of historic proportions -- it was puzzling in part because, despite all the various fireworks of 2016, nearly every poll indicated she was the front-runner -- yet she lost by quite a few states.  That indicates there was something particularly unusual about this election.  </p>

<p>Well, Mueller found something particularly unusual about this election.  </p>

<p>Whether the Russians swung the 2016 election or not is something that we will be discussing a long time, but there can be no doubt that they <em>affected</em> it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What I asserted was exactly what Rosenstein said in his presser. He clearly stated that the election was NOT swayed by the Russians. Maybe you wanna blame someone, but the tactics they were allegedly using were the exact same tactics Clinton was using. People who unwittingly retweeted or attended rallies set up by Russians weren&#39;t influenced by them. They had already made up their minds.</p>

<p>As for Hillary being a terrible candidate, we all watched her lie repeatedly about her emails. She&#39;s not trustworthy. And as for the polls, I don&#39;t know why anyone was surprised that people weren&#39;t telling the truth about who they were voting for. The media was shaming folks on the right for months leading up to the election. They continue to shame them to this very day. The people who voted for Trump are not the ignorant, racist, bigot, islamaphobes that they&#39;ve been depicted as. Immigration is a real problem in this country. People got behind that message. The sheer amount of jobs that have fled to other countries is another issue that pressed highly on their minds. Trump&#39;s was pretty clear on where he stood on those issues. And many of the policies that caused these issues in the first place she is responsible for.</p>

<p>Again, the election was NOT affected. Your entitled to your opinion just as am I but your wrong about this. If your so concerned with Russia and their influence here in the states, I wonder why you aren&#39;t so riled up about her involvement in Uranium One. You know the deal where Russia got 1/5 of our uranium. All of the money her foundation got from Russian donors who directly benefited from the sale and the $500,000 Bill got from speaking at a Russian event. You know the one Putin personally thanked him for. </p>

I will say though that were nearly a year into this investigation and neither you or I have seen evidence that supports your theory.</p>

<p>I truly believe that Clinton lost because she robbed Bernie and lied repeatedly to all of us about those emails. It was very unfortunate for her that the wikileaks dump and the email investigation happened right before the election. But she still had the advantage in my opinion. Which the exception of Fox and a few right wing online publications she had the vast majority of media shilling for her. Hell CNN gave her the questions to the town hall they hosted. She had over a billion dollars at her disposal. She had companies like ShareBlue and Correct The Record doing her bidding. Google was all in for her. It&#39;s amazing to me to this day that she didn&#39;t win. </p>

<p>Again, you&#39;re arguing in platitudes. You cite no figures or relevant quotes to back up these claims you&#39;re making. In one year&#39;s time Trump increased the size of the U.S. forces in Syria, Iraq, and Afghanistan.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>U.S. forces totaled just over 18,000 in these three countries at the end of last December, just before President Obama completed his term, according to the Pentagon&#39;s Defense Manpower Data Center.</p>

<p>The combined figure was about 26,000 as of the end of September, the most recent data available from the Pentagon</p>

<p>Your argument is flawed:</p>

<p>3) This is particularly unusual (Not at all, but we&#39;ll let that slide)</p>

<p>Is this really what we&#39;re looking for?</p>

<p>You have not proven a connection between poor polling results and Russian interference. </p>

<p>There are many other potential reasons why the polling companies were wrong. My guess would be that they have an outdated understanding of which demographics vote and how they vote. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not a statistician by training but I use it in my daily work. I assume that the models they use are quite complicated, and based on several assumptions, many of these based on historical data. </p>

<p>We know that the 2016 election was unique in many ways. (It seems we agree on this). I will postulate that one of the ways it was unique is who turned up to vote and who they voted for. (Im sure we also agree on this)</p>

<p>Those polls were factually wrong. Many were biased and slanted towards Democrats. Many people did not want to be called a Nazi just because they voted Trump. The only thing odd about this election is that the media elites are too far removed from the reality of everyday people and tried to convince the people they know what&#39;s best for them. They are now upset that their propaganda did not work and are doubling down and trying to overthrow a democratically official. </p>

<p>I also like how you dismiss criticism of Hillary Clinton as &quot;three-decade-long hate campaign&quot; but you the imply that Mueller&#39;s investigation into Trump is evidence of something. No, it&#39;s just another smear attack done by a political opponent. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure.  But the question isn&#39;t what the opposing campaigns were doing -- it is whether the Trump campaign received a winning boost from the Russians.  We don&#39;t have proof (and maybe never will, unless Hari Seldon or his equivalent arrives to tell us) that the Russians swung the election with those tactics -- but it&#39;s certainly <em>plausible</em> that they did.  That plausibility is very concerning, because it strikes at the heart of our democracy.  If public opinion can be swayed by a microtargeted propaganda campaign directed by a foreign power, how can we maintain our integrity as a nation?  A few years ago, the very idea would have been laughable.  Now it is deadly serious.  The seriousness of the concern is distinct from the question of whether the election was actually affected.  Our democracy depends on the notion of electoral legitimacy of leadership.  That rock-solid idea was what made things like Birtherism laughable to the mainstream.  The need to <em>keep</em> it rock-solid in the public&#39;s mind is what made birtherism so insidious and erosive for the country as a whole.   </p>

<p>The fact that there is a real, not-crazy concern that <em>this President might not be legitimate</em> is a real worry -- never mind what might have happened in an alternate Universe without Russian meddling.  The worry is not that this President sucks (or not) -- we&#39;ve had bad Presidents before.  The worry is that, with so many of the population genuinely, legitimately (heh) concerned about it, the nation is less stable than it has been since, oh, the 1860s.</p>

<p>First of all, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a good idea at all to either go around figuring out what speech and by whom is allowed because that has not only the potential but guarantee to be an abuse of power. Republicans had to deal with this, and still are by the way, with George Soros for example. The guy has spent orders of magnitude more doing the same and far worse than these Russians. People in the right got organized and got the word out that there were bogus protests being organized. What they aren&#39;t doing is wondering out loud if we need a minister of truth to discern what is and isn&#39;t propaganda (like obama attempted with an executive order).</p>

<p>And I&#39;m sorry, but if you want to make the point that what the Russians did is of dire consequence and that it possibly undermined the election, it is entirely relevant my asking if you&#39;re as concerned if not far more concerned with the examples I brought up. That helps me get a gauge on the particulars of the problem you&#39;re trying to outline and what could or should be done about it. That you see it as &quot;whataboutism&quot; to me says you don&#39;t really see it as an issue, just a tool to be picked up and used when politically expedient to you and dropped when it becomes an inconvenient contradiction aka &quot;whataboutism&quot;</p>

<p>Unethical is subjective, illegal isn&#39;t. Nothing the DNC did was illegal and I fail to see how the funding arrangement, that didn&#39;t apply until after the primaries, got 3.7 million more people to vote for Clinton in the primaries. Care to explain that?</p>

<p>As for the 3.7 million votes that has nothing whatsoever to do with Hillary buying the DNC and robbing Bernie and his supporters. It does have everything to do with the electoral college that Clinton was very much aware of.

<p>I&#39;ve got hairs on my nuts older than most of the people on this sub.</p>

So scandalous! /s  </p>

<p>Meanwhile, Mueller&#39;s investigation has produced multiple indictments as well as multiple cooperating witnesses in less than a year and at a fraction of the cost and it&#39;s not over. This is what a real criminal investigation looks like when it&#39;s ran by a seasoned professional. </p>

<p>The funding arrangement with HFA and the victory fund agreement was not illegal, but it sure looked unethical.

<p>Clinton&#39;s a damn good lawyer and has damn good lawyers on her side. But I find it troubling that people donated to Sanders campaign thinking he had a shot when in fact Clinton had already paid for the nomination. Why this isn&#39;t illegal is beyond me. </p>

<p>This was your reply to my initial comment. You brought up Hillary first my friend. She lost. She&#39;s irrelevant to me and to the rest of the country. I&#39;m not obsessed. I just don&#39;t believe she lost because of Russian propaganda. Was it Russian propaganda that cause her to lose the nomination in 2008? Of course not. She just royally sucked as a candidate. </p>

<p>You however seem to be a victim of her and the MSM&#39;s propaganda. I feel for you really. I think there will be much more to come to light in the next few months. It&#39;s going to be difficult for cats like you who are so dug into your worldviews and our clearly victims of propaganda that&#39;s been pushed on you all from many media sites. You&#39;ll either have your reality shattered and be a broken individual or you&#39;ll be a victim of cognitive dissonance. Good luck with that my friend!</p>

<p>I get people have opinions that are different than mine and when their coming from a genuine place I can respect that. But lately I&#39;ve seen many comments that were just outright wrong. And I guess it&#39;s possible some people may just be ignorant about the topic, but I do believe there are folks who are intentionally misleading and twisting facts to paint a picture that&#39;s false. Shills. If nothing else the indictments should prove to people that shills and bots exist to push a narrative that someone wants you to believe. It&#39;s just a reality these days. Suppression and censorship isn&#39;t as obvious as it once was. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Watergate break in didn&#39;t affect the outcome of the &#39;72 election. That doesn&#39;t mean it didn&#39;t subvert Democracy. Maybe this time it didn&#39;t affect the outcome of the election, despite the razor thin upset margin. You still have to punish it or else someone else will do the same thing and actually affect the outcome.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It makes a whole lot more sense when you think of the media class like they&#39;re someone who is nearing the end of a long term relationship who sees the writing on the ground wall, doesn&#39;t want to take responsibility despite deeply knowing they&#39;re responsible, and is desperate to deflect and project all their frustration and shortcomings into the other party. </p>

<p>If you&#39;ve ever known people like this or been in the situation yourself, you&#39;ll notice that the preoccupation and focus and paranoia is intense and that any sense of self awareness goes out the window. This actually hastens the downward spiral and becomes self-fulfilling. You noticed that with the democrats and MSM, as you mentioned the obsessive overzealous nature of the pushback against Trump (who, empirically, was running on a fairly moderate platform that wasn&#39;t too far out of line from 90s democrats) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is the argument that needs to be put forward...</p>

<p>To anyone, living anywhere: <em>diversify the media you consume</em>.</p>

<p>If the only radio station you listen to in your car is either Conservative or Liberal, then <em>every other day</em>, change to the other.</p>

<p>If the only newspaper you read is either Conservative or Liberal, then <em>every other day</em>, buy the other one.</p>

<p>If the only TV news network you watch at home is either Conservative or Liberal, then <em>change the channel every other day</em>.</p>

<p>You will gain nothing by being spoon-fed your existing opinions every day.</p>

<p>You will gain perspective by consuming both sides of the argument, and making up your own mind, because that&#39;s how this shit is meant to work.</p>

<p>Disclaimer: don&#39;t expect immediate results. It will take weeks, and possibly months, for any of your pre-existing biases to erode to the point where you hear whatever any of the media outlets are telling you, and you thinking &quot;fuck that... CNN / Fox News is clearly bullshit&quot;</p>

<p>We all need to start giving a shit. We all need to start consuming as many and varied sides of the media as we can.</p>

<p>When you&#39;ve got one side of the story blaring at you 24 hours a day, then whatever they&#39;re telling you is all you&#39;ll believe.</p>

<p>Stop being a puppet. Go out of your way to learn both sides of the story, and make up your own mind. </p>

<p>Become a responsible consumer of news, and you&#39;ll become a responsible person. It really is as simple as that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I already do all that. It&#39;s still not easy, given the huge volumes of information out there coming at us from all directions. It feels like standing in the middle of a busy intersection. It&#39;s also hard to recognize existing biases in yourself based on your upbringing, your socioeconomic status, the region and environment you live and work in, etc. Sometimes I feel like the more I read the more confused I get. When you try your best to consider every point of view, you still need some standard against which to test ideas. What should that standard be? I think this is why religion is such a &quot;thing&quot; in our species. It gives our brains a &quot;true north&quot;. Or at least we choose to believe that it does.</p>

<p>The standard for you is what feels right for you.</p>

<p>Consider yourself as a judge or a magistrate - listen to both sides of any argument, and make up your mind based on the evidence (or lack thereof) that each side provides.</p>

<p>Above all, be skeptical. </p>

<p>Even though last time Fox News / CNN turned out to be correct, next time, they might not be... </p>

<p>Every new issue is a <em>new</em> issue. Learn as much as you can before making a judgment. </p>

<p>I&#39;m lucky - I work in news media, so a huge part of my daily life is trawling through everything from Breitbart to The Hill, reading all of the coverage from one extreme to the other, and then distilling that down into something that I work hard to make objectively, and subjectively, neutral. That&#39;s what I get paid to do.</p>

<p>But whenever anyone asks me about how to deal with media bias, I tell them the same thing in my original comment: Change the channel every day. Listen to both sides of the media, and more often than not, the truth is somewhere in the middle.</p>

<p>So then, moral relativism, aka &quot;the status quo&quot;. You&#39;re saying I can be the judge of &quot;my own truth&quot; simply by testing against my feelings? </p>

<p>If I am a judge or magistrate, I have the law as my &quot;true north&quot;. What standard can be applied by the individual to test for truth in the media. Skepticism and listening to all sides still does not reveal truth, IMO. Ultimately each of us must choose what to believe...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My argument here isn&#39;t about moral relativism - it&#39;s about stepping outside of the media echo chambers that a huge percentage of the population, either wittingly or unwittingly, put themselves into by not changing the channel / reading a different newspaper / etc etc.</p>

<p><em>That&#39;s</em> the point I&#39;m trying to make. </p>

<p>The more you read, the more you know. </p>

<p>And just like people who spend more time reading the Bible than they do reading the news, their view on the world around them will be helplessly skewed.</p>

<p>The only standard that can be applied by the individual as a test for truth in media is the media that individual has consumed.</p>

<p>If you only watch Fox News, then anything that goes against that narrative will sound like bullshit. Same as anyone who only watches CNN.</p>

<p>Hence, we <em>all</em> need to consume a more diverse media landscape, and make up our own minds as to what is spin, and what isn&#39;t - rather than blindly accepting that what we&#39;re being told by political commentators during our morning commute are &quot;the facts&quot;.</p>

<p>If you&#39;ve got any reasonable argument against arming yourself with all of the facts before making a judgment about anything, then by all means, let me know... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s no chance it was even and fair. I&#39;m not sure how many presidential elections you&#39;ve been through but there&#39;s a certain level it usually always gets to. Trump was getting news coverage for breaking all the rules, that&#39;s not overzealous or propaganda, that&#39;s what happens when you intentionally break the status quo. </p>

<p>Hillary had some emails and Benghazi and other scandals sure. These things normally and usually occur, and people get upset, and so on and so forth. This election cycle, we literally had conversations about how bonkers everyone was becoming about Hillary&#39;s flaws. Not critical, but red in the face, veins popping out about whatever she did wrong, no matter how big or small it was. This was the propaganda engine. Absolutely. </p>

<p>Her flaws were there, Trump was criticized of course, but no man in history received the same level of disgust and vitriol for even more heinous crimes. </p>

<p>Trump gets criticized not because of an agenda against him. He gets criticized not because Hillary leads anyone. Hillary is literally somewhere in the shadows, she hasn&#39;t led anyone or anything. He gets criticized, because believe it or not, the majority of Americans disagree with him (as shown by the popular vote, and recent approval polls). Now if you are all drinking some koolaid that makes you think whatever he does is right, I hope to GOD it&#39;s not because someone told you it&#39;s right, someone like Hannity. </p>

<p>I hope to GOD you formed your own opinion and support him because of it. Therefore, anything you say against a democrat is not some agenda, nor is it some conspiracy, it&#39;s just your opinion. Not Fake News, but the way you see things. </p>

<p>That&#39;s exactly what&#39;s happening with Democrats. I don&#39;t care for Hillary one way or another, but when I see an asshat being an asshat, I call him out. And that&#39;s not brainwashing, agenda, or propaganda. It&#39;s a man completely going counter to my values. </p>

<p>Trump is a business democrat turned republican because in 2016 part of the republican platform became &quot;we aren&#39;t drunk on identity politics&quot;. The dogs of war were unleashed on Trump not because his positions are radical, they aren&#39;t at all. He&#39;s saying things bill Clinton was saying in the 90s.

<p>No, no, no, no. nope. nope. nooooooope. </p>

<p>When I saw him announce his candidacy - I was thinking - hmm, this man is onto something. And I listened intently. I told the person I was with, he&#39;s gonna get a lot of support. Then he started being racist, and isolationist. That&#39;s when I was like whoa whoa whoa wtf?</p>

<p>Then he started tweeting like a fucking idiot for lack of a better word. Then he started not taking stances against david Duke, then he started lying, over and over and over again.

No one is picking on him unjustly. </p>

<p>NO ONE. Ever been to <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/TrumpCriticizesTrump/">http://www.reddit.com/r/TrumpCriticizesTrump/</a> ?</p>

<p>He is full of shit, he is full of shit, he is full of shit, and yes he is full of shit. I am so sorry, no one is unjust in their absolute, complete dissatisfaction with this mockery of our presidency. He&#39;s not an existential threat to the elite class. He IS the elite class. He staffs his cabinet with elites, his entire republican congress takes bribes from the elite class, his entire tax cuts says that if you make elite businessmen richer, then it will &#39;trickle down&#39; to the masses.</p>

<p>It definitely was a coup though. He is a literally a fox in the hen house, and he&#39;s using his powers in government to destroy government powers. Such a shit show. I hate it so much.   </p>

<p>Isolationist. Walk me through where our power in the world is right now, I&#39;d love to hear your take on where it&#39;s headed. The British have been calling Trudeau the leader of the free world for months now. Our own officials just told the world to disregard everything the moron says on twitter. </p>

<p>Look at the long term benefactors of his tax plan. Look at who really makes a killing after 5 years, and look who gets shafted. There is no evidence that he has turned on any single elite ever. Bill Gates himself says he should be paying more taxes. He is figuratively spewing money back to the wealthy. Come ON now, whose talking points are you sucking up in your filter bubble. You gotta stop being so exceptional in your arguments, think critically. </p>

<p>Twice since trump has been elected, I&#39;ve applauded him on twitter. I am being fair. Twice, I feel like he&#39;s represented me as an American. 2 whole, times. Asshole acts like his base are the only people that matter, he acts like they&#39;re the only ones worthy of calling themselves Americans. He acts like his base is the only crowd that he serves, and that he will go to the end for them. Well what the fuck about the rest of the country, friend? What the fuck about us? Who is American according to Trump? His base. He will pander, pander pander to his base. Non stop, all day every day. He will ignore, step on, forget, spit out, insult, shit upon the other 300,000 Americans, as if we weren&#39;t AS AMERICAN as his base. He treats us like shit, doesn&#39;t listen to us, do you <em>actually think</em> we won&#39;t talk shit about him? Do you consider that his Base is not America? America is America. His base are just the feeble in finances, weak in education, and poor in virtue, the scared, threatened, attacking and coldest. </p>

<p>Trump is a cheater. A cheater in love, a cheater in business, a cheater in law and a cheater in politics. Once a cheater, always a cheater.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry dude but he&#39;s desperately trying to mend the divide sowed by those who came before him. He&#39;s American that loves his country and his American neighbor, who even if they may not see eye to eye on every issue they at least meet halfway in good faith.</p>

<p>Trumps base though? Look at the language you use. Irredeemable deplorables no doubt.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Rely on our Military for what tho? Like i&#39;m gonna be like a teenage snot and go &quot;yea but why??&quot;... </p>

<p>Bro talking like he wants people to pay for our military bases - Hello? We are the ones who strategically placed them around the world, in their back yards for strategic purposes. Play a quick game of Risk and you&#39;ll see who really benefits from having bases spread out around the world. This is political science 101. They didn&#39;t ask for our Military bases, we <strong>put</strong> them there, for <em>us</em>. </p>

<p>I know this country has troubles. I feel like we need to improve education, we need to improve our general standard of living, I believe community is more important than consumerism. I believe there is a solution to the shootings and opioid problems. And it&#39;s not tough love, it&#39;s not more force. I believe there&#39;s an end to terrorism. I&#39;m not a democrat - I&#39;ll tell you that, there&#39;s a third party that needs to be born. One that respects the quality of life both before an individual is born AND after, not either or. </p>

<p>The language I use is for people that lap up Hannity. He has done so much to damage this country. Fox and friends? They destroy common ground. Our president will do everything for his base. He acts like he is 100% successful because he panders to his base. </p>

<p>The only place he&#39;s moved the needle is backwards. I don&#39;t believe progress should come at the cost of identity and tradition. I believe in improving lives for all of us, just the way we are. It&#39;s not a zero sum game. There is enough to go around several times over - people act like someone has to lose for someone else to gain. Except - hey, we can harvest sunlight and wind, we can grow plants forever, we can continually produce, and produce we do. But someone takes it all. They either prevent us from doing it, or they take the profits and they don&#39;t spread it around. It doesn&#39;t make the world better place. They take and take and take, and our president is one of them. He&#39;s only in it so he can take. This is a fact.Nearly everything he has signed his name to is a conflict of interest, because he benefits immensely from the policies he creates.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like he&#39;s playing the banker in monopoly, inventing the rules so that he ends up with all the cash in the bank, at the cost of everyone playing the game. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly I agree with everything you&#39;re saying. I also recognize while the geopolitics are complicated, we&#39;d be better off on many levels without so much force deployed around the world.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not a Fox News type and I mostly hate their whole network. I think citizen media is doing a far better job, guys like Styxhexenhammer666. I look at the big and small picture at the same time though and I&#39;ll tell you what I saw/see.</p>

<p>There&#39;s all these people in the middle who aren&#39;t really political and don&#39;t want to be and would agree with just about everything you said. Then you&#39;ve got your politically aware and active in either side. The problem is, the left is better at organizing support and they&#39;re more committed to their cause. That is to say, despite claiming to be into diversity they only mean it skin deep. The politically active left are wholly uninterested in diversity of ideas. Universities aren&#39;t looking around saying to themselves gosh we need more conservatives in the humanities department. A study was done at Brown recently that showed in 1965 their journalism department comprised of 4 liberals to each conservative. Today it&#39;s 65 to 1.</p>

<p>So you see this divide accelerates and metastasizes. 90% of media out there today is leftist, and not casually. These people aren&#39;t like Edward R. Murrows and Walter Cronkites of yesterday. They&#39;ve got an axe to grind and they&#39;ve got an agend to serve. </p>

<p>As a conservative, the problem I saw was that too many people just wanted to be left alone and keep to themselves or otherwise felt browbeaten by leftists who would socially ostracize them from their communities or their workplace. Personally, I&#39;m the leave me to myself type so I get it, but that leaves the door wide open for the politically active left to just run roughshod over everyone. That&#39;s how we ended up with Bill Nye trying to convince us there&#39;s no such thing as gender and Canada signing law that compels particular language with bill C16. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t personally think Trumps platform is radical at all, and I came to believe his rough and assertive tactics are not only fine, but completely necessary. I&#39;m telling you my dude, the people throwing a fit about Trump were turning a blind eye to the path they found themselves on. I gave an interview to the Japanese press election night and I told them this. That the left should be thanking their lucky stars this correction came in the form of Donald Trump, all said a fairly moderate guy. Because if he&#39;d lost, what was absolutely coming after trump they were not going to like and neither would I. If the left continues to play identity politics, they will conjure a demon on the right that will not lose that game. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you really believe all that stuff? You have to be pretty dense to think Trump isn&#39;t a racist piece of shit. Isolationist? His entire platform was isolation and stopping globalism...Trump turned on the elites? You realize he just gave corporations, you know the entities that are owned by the elites, 1.5 trillion dollars over 10 years. We could have healthcare and education for that much money, instead the elites just get richer and the wealth inequality gap gets larger. I can&#39;t believe you really think Trump turned on the elites. He&#39;s by far the most spoiled narcissist I&#39;ve ever seen. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t understand how you people put up with his lying, weren&#39;t you raised to not trust liars? It&#39;s crazy how many people weren&#39;t raised right in this country. Trump just ain&#39;t right, you&#39;re better than him. </p>

<p>The real conspiracy imo is that the establishment is conspiring to delegitimize a duly elected president at any cost by pushing the narrative that he is a Russian agent. Following the most recent Mueller indictment that showed the Russians supporting many different candidates as far back as 2014, the narrative is now that Trump’s “denial” of their interference amounts to treason. </p>

<p>Trump poses a direct threat to the establishment to the status quo, and delegitimizing him is way more preferable to these people than offering truly progressive candidates that can win elections. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That’s how advertising works. 
At the last election I. The uk I was gobsmacked  to hear someone who I had assumed to be reasonably clever say that they’d read this post on social media which they said was the first thing they’d seen that was unbiased and just common sense. I had seen the same post and it was clearly biased, misrepresented facts and designed to persuade to one side of the vote.
I didn’t think they should change their view or otherwise, I was just surprised they couldn’t see it wasn’t unbiased.
I think the issue is that adults who vote genuinely don’t consider :
- is this source valid?
- is this source trying to persuade?
- is this source representing facts without bias or manipulation?</p>

<p>The untruths I heard from people, who had read them them and believed to be truth was quite disheartening </p>

<p>I also think that people DO know they are being manipulated but choose to allow it because it fits their own narrative. It gives them permission to believe what they want to. </p>

<p>Sorry about formatting but thats the copy paste from indictments.</p>

<p>You are assuming everyone went out of their way to read policy notes from candidates websites. Most people, and most likely more susceptible, just listened to what the ads said on their facepage. This is the same argument this sub makes against the MSM, that they lie and you need to find the truth for yourself but most people won&#39;t. Same applies here, they see fake news from facebook, assume its true and their opinions are changed. These people aren&#39;t R or D but are probably just fence sitting until the week of the election as most do not truly care. Obviously hard R&#39;s weren&#39;t swayed but its about that middle ground that maybe had an opinion changed based on a lie that Hillary ate abortions or committed voter fraug or is &quot;a satan.&quot;</p>

<p>2) This is just plain false: <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/09/06/the-zombie-claim-that-hillary-clinton-was-fired-during-the-watergate-inquiry/?utm_term=.4fb34f14468d">https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/09/06/the-zombie-claim-that-hillary-clinton-was-fired-during-the-watergate-inquiry/?utm_term=.4fb34f14468d</a>. You&#39;re literally falling for chain email and facebook meme level stuff here.</p>

<p>4) The Clintons support similar causes to Soros and the Clinton Foundation does a lot of good around the world. Not sure what your specific beef is here.</p>

<p>I can list more if you like, but Hillary is trash. If you want to defend that is fine with me</p>

<p>So your entire reasoning for disliking her are a bunch of debunked conspiracy theories that have been pushed hard by Russian trolls? You don&#39;t see the irony?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&#39;t even defend fact Trump can be a brash hypocrite, but at least the man can hit the dime on corruption more often than not. I remember JFK was not a perfect man himself with similar accusations to Trump. JFK has info of affairs with other women, accused of Russian collusion, etc both JFK and Trump are very much a like one is more private about it other is more public, but overall the same.</p>

<p>How fucking dare you try to equate Trump with JFK. JFK served the American people for his entire life. Trump has only ever served himself</p>

<p>You should probably just stop talking before you further expose yourself comrade</p>

There are photos of JFK Jr and Trump together plenty of times before JFK Jr death want to know why? JFK and Trump had very similar characters. Brash, quick to anger and both had it in for the ladies. There are plenty of books on JFK on his affairs with other women. There are plenty of books on JFK being pissed off at other people in similar ways Trump has been. The biggest similarity is both has called out the deep state, both have called out the intelligent communities and both have been accused of Russian collusion because they both are threats to the system.

<p>Oh please. What kind of schoolyard shit is this? Look, I get the obvious differences between the left and the right just fine, but when it comes down to compromise - in case you haven&#39;t been paying much attention for the last 30 to 40 years - both sides have been growing increasingly bullish. You can hear it in the way they communicate, it&#39;s poisonous and often loaded to rile up their supporters. Both sides play that game for sure and they do it very well thanks to the 24/7 news cycle and every god damn person having constant updates in the palm of their hand. </p>

<p>Being the leader of any group has its advantages. If you want to know who the leader of a group of businessmen is, it&#39;s the guy that says, &quot;Well, I think it&#39;s about time we go for lunch, let&#39;s head over to X restaurant.&quot; </p>

<p>The leader of the group steers the ship. Being accepted as the leader of NATO and The Free World we were the ones expected to dictate the course of the ship. We&#39;re not choosing restaurants though. We&#39;re talking about international united policy about what nations should be shunned, invaded as a united front, defended from aggressors.....this should all really be obvious stuff, man. </p>

<p>We&#39;re considered a fucking clown show now. Trump says Jerusalem is Israel&#39;s capital. Every country I can think of thought this was a really inflammatory and simply stupid thing to do. It made Zionists and his base happy, bc they think it&#39;ll get Jesus here quicker, but the international community facepalmed. Just like they facepalm when our leader tweets out his bullshit or gets caught paying off pornstars. It&#39;s a disgrace (btw if any Trump people read this, I know how to set up completely untraceable LLCs....could have saved you, and the rest of us, a lot of embarassment). </p>

<p>As someone from a foreign country, I can pretty much confirm this. The American president has a pretty big affect on how the American people are perceived.</p>

<p>Trump is like a rancid fart in a crowded elevator. We didn&#39;t elect him, but we&#39;re stuck suffering through him along with everyone else.</p>

<p>They may as well have said fuck all. US Intelligence made the &quot;announcement&quot; the same night Trumps &quot;Grab &#39;em by the Pussy tape leaked&quot;. Your article even says strong supporters of Clinton’s campaign argued—some at the time, many more in the wake of the former secretary of state’s shocking November election defeat—that the Obama team should have done more to publicize the hacking for what it was: a heavy-handed Kremlin intervention on behalf of one side in America’s presidential election. </p>

<p>The article, that I&#39;m sure you read, goes on to say that Obama and company basically decided making a big deal of it would sully voter confidence.</p>

<p>The big problem was they couldn&#39;t get a GOP higher-up on board to come out publicly against Russia. The Obama administration looked down on slamming the Kremlin for election meddling unless it was a bipartisan statement. Why was the GOP unwilling?

<p>Well, than you might not like how some people from other countries look at the roles America want to play and the social implications they have on a global scale. Not only in the war department but also education, media and entertainment have also changed a lot in my home country due to influence from America and some consorts.</p>

<p>The current wave of political correctness sweeping the world is for instance just an example and we can all se the implications for everybody involved.

<p>This reminds me of the &quot;Trump declared Jerusalem the capital of Israel&quot; bullshit.

<p>The golf-course deduction in particular has drawn scrutiny before in Washington from both sides of the aisle. <strong>Former President Barack Obama included restrictions on the deduction in his budget for at least three years.</strong> In April, Republican Senator Jeff Flake listed the golf course deduction in a report he wrote entitled, “Tax Rackets: Outlandish Loopholes to Lower Tax Liabilities.”</p>

<p>Would Hillary have restricted the deductions that so greatly benefit Trump as Obama did? Why wouldn&#39;t she, if not get rid of the, as the Republican put it, &quot;racket&quot; altogether?</p>

<p>I posited we&#39;d have net neutrality under Hillary. A &quot;maybe&quot; response got upvotes. </p>

<p>Obama passed regs specifically protecting net neutrality, but she would do something radically different? Why? </p>

<p>I didn&#39;t comment on net neutrality, but since you are pushing that narrative, you should know that <a href="https://www.cio.com/article/3037467/consumer-electronics/comcast-us-telcos-gave-88m-to-lawmakers-in-2015.html">&quot;Comcast and its fellow cable and wireless providers gave more money to Hillary Clinton (nearly $358,000) than to any other presidential candidate.&quot;</a> Number 2 on the list got $66,000.</p>

<p>As for Jerusalem, you want to act like this is entirely about the embassy and not that he publicly recognized it as its capital <em>breaking with 7 decades of US foreign policy.</em> </p>

<p>You can disagree with his principles but the man believes what he says and isn&#39;t on the take. He doesn&#39;t have a &quot;foundation&quot; that Russians give millions to, isn&#39;t in the billionaires club motivated to make his buddies rich, etc. </p>

<p>the American public was NOT subverted, this is Mueller theater. He is justifying his existence, and a friendly grand jury will indict a ham sandwich.  All he has (from theindictments) is a group of shitstirrers. He doesnt even have hard evidence they are russian government, and knows he will never have to present any, the accused are all out of reach.</p>

<p>So if we take the indictments at face value and just agree with the assumptions the SC made, a bunch of agitators have attempted to cause political chaos. SO? </p>

<p>isnt that what happens already every day? George Soros does it as a long running hobby. Is HE registered as a &quot;foreign agent&quot;? If not, where is HIS indictment? And he is the tip of the iceberg. If its all of a sudden a crime for non US citizens to conduct online and offline political demagoguery that is otherwise legal, what statute is being broken?  the indictments are literally saying creating shill reddit profiles=identity theft, when shariablue does that every day</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This one - not really, but I feel my definition of substantial is not the same as yours. The most cost effective strategy is to fund those who are on the other side of the divide and are objectively weaker/at a disadvantge and this is what not only Russians but others do all the time.</p>

<p>However, if you zoom back to a 50+ year time span, the manipulation has been effective. Soviets, Russians, and others were always funding anti-war groups, social activists who are defending gays, lesbians, transgenders, anti-religious activists. They pick the vocal minority. As I wrote in another comment, such strategies are all about long-term and even ultra long-term (think 100+ years).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The populace is always in the dark but less and less now that we have the internet. At least we have a better chance of educating ourselves on things vs being spoon fed all news by the teevee with three literal channels like when I was a kid. More deep politics is being uncovered for thise who care to search and read. 50 years ago the whitehouse used the fact that their populace was in the dark about the soviets to scare the shit out of us , tho they secretly knew the truth. The more things change the deeper and more conplex the politics. The narratives are not 4-6 story lines or agendas like when I was a kid... know it’s a bazarro world of complexities and dark deep politics with thousands of tentacles and tertiary manipulations. Really appreciate your thoughtful posting btw. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for the kind words. While I knew what to expect by creating this thread and the one I mentioned, it made me a bit sad that I got a verification of my theory. The title of the post was crafted in a way that it can be spun in so many different directions; however, people mostly picked the one that&#39;s being talked about the most - latest elections. It only validates the need to educate people in long term thinking and creative problem solving.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know how else to say that this is intentionally or unintentionally a poorly thought out call for authoritarian ethnic nationalism. </p>

<p>Which is kind of an absurd call in the US because the point of a federalist system is to use the heterogeneity of states in tandem with a united federal interest to address international or national concerns. An inherent division (the separation of powers) is fundamental to the structure of the country. </p>

<p>Authoritarian states like Russia and China have issues like tenement building collapses and crazy civil rights violations but they just shoot people who complain about it. They have issues like Chechnya ignoring federal law and the literal, rapid cultural genocide of subgroups.</p>

<p>Of course the KGB, a spook agency from an authoritarian country would think heterogeneity is a poison pill and push that strategy - the same way the CIA thought media-bombing commies was the way to subvert their national stability. Everybody is biased in that they seek solutions from their own cultural perspective</p>

<p>If you want to vote for the exsanguination of minorities and try to set up an ethno-state, go for it, but there will always be heterogeneity until you go full Borg and rewrite everyone to think exactly the same and have automatically networked experiences. In the meanwhile, heterogeneity actually makes the US stronger because it decentralizes avenues of vulnerability - it&#39;s just that bipartisan politics has always subverted a necessarily inclusive federal position and the information age no longer permits citizens to unite against the spectre of &quot;other&quot;. In other words, it&#39;s time for the office of President to realize its initial conception and be a unifying force of all groups instead of an idolized figurehead of whatever crowd of colored shirts voted them in.</p>

<p>I also want to point out that attempting to ham-fistedly stamp out dissidence will lead to more political vulnerability as other actors will then capitalize on an increasing sense of victimization and panic to push their own agenda - see: Holocaust (Jews et. al), American Revolution (France et American Rebels), Vietnam War (Viet Cong and Villagers), ISIL, NRA, etc etc. </p>

<p>Every time National Socialism departs from a premise of monoethnic authoritarianism (which, again, intentionally or unintentionally, you are proposing), you get either bad PR which leads to international coalitions against you, or mass killings, which lead to the foundation of an authoritarian state that&#39;s still riddled with issues (perhaps even more) but looks &quot;better&quot; from the outside-in. </p>

<p>The irony of this is that it&#39;s the sort of thing that ethnic supremacists are probably down for, but calls for cultural equality from current minority groups can easily bbe read as a desire to assimilate into the cultural majority through the abolition of socio-economic barriers that create exactly the divisions you are worried about - Russia doesn&#39;t need to do shit, inner-cities and meth parks do enough on their own to divide the US.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>According to some posters this thread, it&#39;s very easy to do it to other countries too, the US does it all the time, and that&#39;s why we should all lie down and take the propaganda from Russia like good boys and girls because US citizens have no moral authority to be concerned about the Russian government covertly interfering in US elections. It&#39;s not a &quot;new idea&quot; so there&#39;s no reason to make a big deal, except those who want to create a &quot;Russian meddling&quot; scare.</p>

<p>Again: it&#39;s okay for Russia to meddle in the US election, it&#39;s probably not effective, if it&#39;s effective, it&#39;s the US citizen&#39;s fault. The US does the same to Russia so we should all calm down and except it without making a big deal. </p>

<p>Hahaha, I&#39;m sure you aren&#39;t surprise, but there were sure a lot of posters saying there&#39;s zero evidence of Russian interference in the US election before the indictment came down.

    <div class="md"><p>America wasn&#39;t subverted by Tweets and Facebook posts. Poverty and social justice chose this election, Trump&#39;s rhetoric targeted groups that mainstream society had rejected completely, meaning poor white people. Democrats (except Sanders) don&#39;t want to lift a finger to help somebody who&#39;s white, and Republicans don&#39;t want to lift a finger to help somebody who&#39;s poor, Donald Trump had access to a huge voting bloc that the rest of the political spectrum had turned their backs on.</p>

<p>we had a common king, a common religion, a common national identity. Now we don&#39;t have kings, religion is being pushed away by science, which, ironically, is a new religion, and you&#39;re not allowed to be a nationalist because you&#39;re literally Hitler if you do that.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think you hit the nail on the head there.</p>

<p>I know it&#39;s not this simple, but I really believe that promoting Individualism to the degree that schools and pop culture have been for the last few decades has absolutely contributed to the mess we&#39;re finding ourselves in today.</p>

<p>Simply put, people have their heads up their asses and aren&#39;t willing to collaborate. You see symptoms of this failure all around: Unions are shit, governments (local, and big) are shit, community is practically a concept from yesteryear and is only being revived as a tool for tech companies to further blur the lines between home and work for their employees.</p>

<p>America is fundamentally broken on both an institutional level and a social level and frankly I&#39;m not sure if it can ever really be fixed. At least not without a few more decades of radical social change. We have to change the paradigm on which we raise the next generation of children. Rather than raising them on reckless fantasies (you can do and be anything you want) and telling them that each are unique and should strive to express their uniqueness.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The common identity is supposed to be that we are all human, and then our smaller group is Americans. </p>

<p>Your comment about Hitler and science becoming a religion shows your bias pretty obviously. </p>

<p>So I guess I would ask you why your side has lost its moral compass?</p>

<p>What happened to the moral majority?</p>

<p>What happened to family values?</p>

<p>Is it possible that far less has changed than you suggest, and the truth is the rich n powerful are operating on the same basis they always have? </p>

<p>You mention the 60s as if there was social unity but in truth life was just as divided as it is today AND we had a significant portion of our populace had no voice. </p>

<p>I agree with you completely that we need to find common good and we need to start thinking of our nation in long term aspects instead of short term gains.</p>

As little as another can go to hell or heaven for me, so little can he believe or disbelieve for me; and as little as he can open or shut heaven or hell for me, so little can he drive me to faith or unbelief. Since, then, belief or unbelief is a matter of every one&#39;s conscience, and since this is no lessening of the secular power, the latter should be content and attend to its own affairs and permit men to believe one thing or another, as they are able and willing, and constrain no one by force.&quot;</p>

Keeps people wasting their energy and directing their hate towards the outside enemy rather than focus on the rot within. Lastly, US diplomacy has always been, america first, meaning allies are either beneath US or not allies at all. Hence rising economic power of russia and china is a huge threat, and one US cannot compete with on an economic scale, it will sabdue with military force. Hence the talk about using low yeild nukes(like somehow justifying war). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think part of the problem is that America is so large that people can easily live in their bubbles and let their ignorance and bigotry fester. A lot of Americans never travel or visit another country. </p>

<p>The Republican Party has also done an excellent job of brain washing the majority of the white poor and middle class into believing they are one of them.  My aunt for example sake. Was a nurse. Had some sort of event or injury to her back. Allegedly she can’t stand for more than 8 hours a day.  She pretty much just hangs out all day and posts ignorant shit on FB now. But if you met her would think she was a perfectly able woman. But she is a staunch Trump supporter. Middle age white women living off disability hates the idea of free healthcare.</p>

<p>Can’t tell you how many poor whites I know buying into the idea that more taxes keeps businesses from growing and expanding more jobs. No what’s going on is that the rich elite get their tax break and horde their fucking money and not invest it back into America.</p>

<p>They’ve done an excellent PR campaign in equating socialism into communism. But if anyone actually subjectively looked at it. Communist Russia was a corrupt mask. It was never communism to begin with. It was a facade.</p>

<p>What we are starting to see and hopefully for the better is society confronting itself with real questions that will determine our future as a nation and race of people.</p>

<p>One day technology will drive healthcare costs to a minimum. But will the right thing be done and actually make it affordable, free? Or will people continue to be fucked in the ass? </p>

<p>Trump won because he fed off people’s hatred and bigotry. Despite Russia’s involvement he got way too close to fucking begin with. People believe what they want to believe and today they can find any article with spin on it to back it up.</p>

<p>Basically the media paints a picture of consent of the people.</p>

<p>They portrayed Trump as a populist peoples candidate so they could ignore the socialist who raised the most amount of individual donations for a presidential candidate ever (over $200 million).</p>

<p>It extinguished more eyeballs from seeing the socialist &amp; also kept Clinton scandals out of the news.</p>

<p>People see it &amp; the trick is that they start saying &quot;See all these people are idiots for electing Trump!!!!&quot;</p>

<p>What they don&#39;t talk about is how deep state made sure to make it legal to propagandize it&#39;s populace in 2013 &amp; then using it in an election.</p>

<p>If you think TPTB didn&#39;t know there was heavy interest in socialism building before 2015 you aren&#39;t paying attention.</p>

<p>They know the most popular thoughts trending at anytime &amp; they use it against you.</p>

<p>Just like Noam says &#39;Manufactured consent&#39;.....it&#39;s an illusion to get you to think &quot;most other people are not like me&quot; otherwise how could we end up like this.</p>

<p>It makes people feel disempowered.</p>

<p>The media put Trump in office and people got suspicious hence Russia hysteria/propaganda.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The human ape isn&#39;t that intelligent and social complexity creates niches for the psychological and intelligence differentials inherent to our species to manifest as subcultures, and the ape-driven stupidity of these subcultures gets amplified by communications technology to confuse and manipulate even dumber minds as part of a game-theory driven clusterfuck. The complexity also explodes vectors of corruption and makes accountability impossible. These are emergent phenomena of a system that was not set up carefully enough, which much have immunization and checks and balance systems to emerge in a scaling way along with the complexity. The founding fathers had no concept of complex system, evolution, emergent phenomena, neuroscience, the fact we don&#39;t have free will, etc.</p>

<p>That&#39;s the actual answer in summary.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are a number of reasons this strategy if dividing the American populace into opposing has worked.  It starts with the proliferation of for profit news outlets, which constitute the majority of news media that Americans consume.  People think they’re learning what’s important without realizing that those companies only publicize the stories they want pushed in the way they want to push them.</p>

<p>Worse, those companies have presented biased entertainers as legitimate news reporters, and people buy it, largely because they received a poor education and lack critical thinking skills, but also because the majority of this country is made up of poor people who think they deserve more than the next guy.  They’re easily manipulated and, consistent with human nature, resort to tribalism as a source of comfort.  People like knowing other people feel the way they do and like being able to point to some “other” as the source of their problems.  More often than not, some other group.</p>

<p>Since at least the early 90s, conservative entertainers like Limbaugh, and then later Hannity, Jones, Beck, and many others have waged a very, very successful propaganda war and recruited millions of angry people to their side of the table.  Millions of angry white people either scared or pissed at the changing face of America formed up on one side of the table, and starting with Gingrich’s Contract with America, began actively hating anyone who didn’t agree with them and stopped reaching across the aisle.  Liberals reacted as you would expect and former their own tribe.  What they lacked in persuasive authoritative personalities, they made up for through their simple ability to control the vast bulk of the news being aired and publicized through their control of most major media sources.</p>

<p>So, for about 25 years now, we’ve had two opposing teams who not only refuse to talk, but refuse to LISTEN, choosing to only pay attention to their team’s “news sources,” which are 100% biased propaganda riddled with lies and half truths.  Of course those same people would fall for fake stories and narratives pushed by Russian trolls or whoever was actually behind it.  It didn’t matter what the story was, whether it was true, or where it ultimately started, as long as it was pushed by the reader’s team’s media source, it was true.  And it’s still going on and not going to stop.  Read the NYT every morning and watch Hannity every night.  You’ll think you’re going insane because nothing you’ll read will match up with anything you see on tv.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If Rural Americans weren’t so uneducated and learned about propaganda in school like most liberals have this wouldn’t even be an issue but when you have large amounts of uneducated people, then propaganda becomes an effective tool. That’s why it works so well in countries where the population isn’t allow to go to school like North Korea or other Middle East authoritarian countries. </p>

<p>Just look at how insane the posts are in T_D, no educated people would fall for any of that fake news/propaganda. Look at this sub, people are willing to believe Sandy Hook never happened despite all the videos and pictures. It takes a special kind of stupid to be that gullible. Corporations have a field day with the uneducated. The NRA spends tens of millions putting out propaganda. Corporations spent tens millions getting Trump elected and look what they got in return, instead of healthcare and education, Trump decided to give 1.5 trillion with t to corporations. If you want to be a real conspiracy theorist and not just an Alex Jones level nutter, follow the money. Always follow the money and keep an open mind that sometimes your intuition might be wrong. </p>

<p>This sub ignores all the evidence based juicy conspiracies about Trump and instead trot out complete non-sense like Sandy Hook being a hoax. Trump will get indicted and you morons will be the only people surprised, despite supposedly being on top of conspiracies. </p>

<p>Just do me a favor, when Trump is indicted, try to change your ways and start using evidence and always follow the money. Also, try to be less nutty, right this sub if filled with people nuttier than squirrel poo. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great post, I hope it gets through to people. I&#39;m not big on the Russia angle but I don&#39;t doubt that a relatively small number of people online have the ability to sway public opinion. Whether Russian or not, the internet had a decisive factor in the election. I find it says much more about the public than about those posting things online. In addition unless someone was posting blatantly false things online I fail to see what the issue was. If you&#39;re too dumb to properly research political candidates and issues then you should not be voting. I don&#39;t want those people voting. </p>

<p>Aristotle and the ancients predicted this. Democracies that get too large are often ungovernable for a variety of reasons. It&#39;s an unpleasant thought but we might need to make our society less democratic in order to survive and remain competitive against other nations. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s not an &quot;everyone agrees with me&quot; argument.  It&#39;s a &quot;when even Trump is now saying that he sees there is evidence of Russians meddling in the election there must be something to the indictment.&quot;  Do you think Trump would have said he agreed with the charges if he looked at the indictment and thought it was bullshit?  Of course not.  He&#39;d be saying &quot;This is just another stage of the witch hunt by the FBI!!&quot;  Instead of that he is now having to admit that there&#39;s something there.  And if Trump is saying that after actually looking at what the FBI saw I&#39;m going to go ahead and believe him more than I listen to Assange who saw nothing and is talking out of his ass. </p>

<p>But as far as the &quot;Russians were just trolling, lol!&quot; argument.  Why the hell would people in Russia decide to &quot;troll&quot; a foreign election?  And why would they troll in a way that was specifically targeted to hurt on candidate and help another?  That sounds like that trolling had an intended purpose.  Almost like it wasn&#39;t just &quot;trolling&quot; which is why there were indictments that even Trump can&#39;t scoff at.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>President Trump on Wednesday <strong>formally recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, reversing nearly seven decades of American foreign policy</strong> and setting in motion a plan to move the United States Embassy from Tel Aviv to the fiercely contested Holy City.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>One Tax Loophole Untouched So Far: The Trump Golf-Course Break</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The golf-course deduction in particular has drawn scrutiny before in Washington from both sides of the aisle. <strong>Former President Barack Obama included restrictions on the deduction in his budget for at least three years.</strong> In April, Republican Senator Jeff Flake listed the golf course deduction in a report he wrote entitled, “Tax Rackets: Outlandish Loopholes to Lower Tax Liabilities.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-11-09/one-tax-loophole-untouched-so-far-the-trump-golf-course-break">https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-11-09/one-tax-loophole-untouched-so-far-the-trump-golf-course-break</a></p>

<p>Would Hillary have restricted the deductions that so greatly benefit Trump as Obama did? Why wouldn&#39;t she, if not get rid of the, as the Republican put it, &quot;racket&quot; altogether?</p>

<p>I posited we&#39;d have net neutrality under Hillary. A &quot;maybe&quot; response got upvotes. </p>

<p>Obama passed regs specifically protecting net neutrality, but she would do something radically different? Why? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>With all due respect, that website contains really bad examples of defining a task. &quot;Bring back the American dream&quot; is one of them. That&#39;s not a specific, measurable, actionable, realistic, and a time bound goal. It&#39;s a political selling point/slogan taken literally. How do you measure the American dream? Who defines what the dream is? When can you say you&#39;ve created the American dream? It&#39;s all bullshit.</p>

<p>I am concerned about one other thing - relativity. What rate of success should be considered acceptable? How did other presidents do their jobs? This principle also applies in business. You never look at a company in vacuum. You must always compare it to the market.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you realize that net neutrality as a legal order has only been around since April 2015? So scary to think that we have gone back to the internet dark days of 2014. Has anything for you actually changed since the repeal? Other than Google filtering and Facebook deleting anything that doesn&#39;t fit a far-Left narrative?</p>

<p>I support the idea of a free and open internet. And maybe something sinister can come of the repeal. But as of now, it seems it is just scare mongering. Reminds me of the Right warning us that universal health care means 6 month waits for surgery and death panels.</p>
