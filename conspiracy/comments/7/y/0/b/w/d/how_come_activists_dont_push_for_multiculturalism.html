<p>I happened to ask a psychiatrist why the Jewish &quot;intelligentsia&quot; behaved like that? She told me that could be a sign of a guilty conscience. Meaning that Jewish fella is conscious of the fact Israel is on the wrong.</p>

<p>I should much rather see reasonable agreement with the Arabs on the basis of living together in peace than the creation of a Jewish state.

<p>Revised: </p>

<p>in &quot;Israel&quot; you have <em>Jews from</em> Russia, <em>Jews from</em> Polska, <em>Jews from</em> Ukraine, <em>Jews from</em> Germany, <em>Jews from</em> France, <em>Jews from</em> Iraq, <em>Jews from</em> Yemen, <em>Jews from</em> Turkey, <em>Jews from</em> Ethiopia, <em>Jews from</em> Syria, etcetera all in one Nation: <strong><em>&quot;i will call this Multicultural&quot;!</em></strong></p>

<p>I will call Israel <em>the</em> most glaring, ugly and despicable example of bigoted national chauvinism, exceptionalism, exclusivism, ethnosupremacism, and aggressive racism that exists, <em>as a political entity</em>, in the modern age. </p>

<p>Of course, many people would respond to these observations by calling me an &quot;<strong><em>anti-Semite</em></strong>&quot;, but their pitiful accusations won&#39;t change the facts.</p>

<p>The tribalist ideas and ideologies on which the Zionist entity was founded, and continues to rest, present a dangerous liability. These antiquated concepts pose a serious threat to the peaceful coexistence of all humanity in a shrinking and increasingly interdependent world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jewish Virtual Library: <a href="http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/are-jews-a-nation-or-a-religion">Judaism: Are Jews a Nation or a Religion?</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Judaism can be thought of as being simultaneously a religion, a nationality <strong><em>and a culture</em></strong>.</p>

<p>Throughout the middle ages and into the 20th century, most of the European world agreed that Jews constituted <strong><em>a distinct nation</em></strong>. This concept of nation does not require that a nation have either a territory nor a government, but rather, <strong><em>it identifies, as a nation any distinct group of people with a common language and culture.</em></strong> Only in the 19th century did it become common to assume that each nation should have its own distinct government; this is the political philosophy of nationalism. In fact, <em>Jews had a remarkable degree of self-government until the 19th century</em>. So long as Jews lived in their ghettos, they were allowed to collect their own taxes, run their own courts, and otherwise behave as citizens of a landless and distinctly second-class Jewish nation.</p>

<p>Of course, Judaism is a religion, and it is <strong><em>this religion that forms the central element of the Jewish culture that binds Jews together as a nation</em></strong>. It is the religion that defines foods as being kosher and non-kosher, and this underlies Jewish cuisine. It is the religion that sets the calendar of Jewish feast and fast days, and it is the religion that has preserved the Hebrew language.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is no shortage of clever &quot;word alchemists&quot; who go to great lengths in their efforts to contort and twist the perception of what it means to be &quot;Jewish&quot;, but the fantasies that they concoct are ignored by the State of Israel, that has very clear definitions on who <em>is</em> or <em>is not</em>* accepted as Jewish, and in Israel, that distinction defines one&#39;s status and rights in day-to-day reality.</p>

<p>The article I linked mentions &quot;conversions&quot;, but the reality is that these are rare specimens indeed. Not only does Judaism not proselytize, they generally <strong><em>reject</em></strong> non-Jews who seek to convert as a matter of course. </p>

<p>Most &quot;conversions&quot; performed outside of Israel are rejected as &quot;illegitimate&quot; by Israeli authorities, and conversions performed within the Zionist state are so rare that they are, for stylistically non-existent, as the data from Pew Research shows.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.pewforum.org/2016/03/08/religious-affiliation-and-conversion/pf_2016-03-08_israel-03-05/">Virtually no conversion across religions in Israel</a>. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.pewforum.org/2016/03/08/religious-affiliation-and-conversion/">Here is a link to the source page.</a></p>

<p>If Judaism is a culture, as described, Israel is largely a multi-flavored monoculture.</p>

<p>I believe this is totally reasonable request. Hey, you robbed their land. Actually, Israel must also compensate them with $$$ for murdering and torturing them. And all those war criminals like NutandYahoo must be jailed/hanged.</p>

<p>Am I nut? Well, this is exactly what you did and still doing ...</p>

<p>The Jewish gangsters demanded compensation for Jew (many are fakes) who never been to war or suffered Holocaust. Not only Germany, also made America pay for it. </p>

<p>The Mossad even sneaked into other country ILLEGALLY and kidnapped whoever they suspect as former Nazi. Also did heinous thing like carried out mass murder eg. poisoning German water/bread ... Even insist on jailing seniors as old as 96 who was a mere bookkeeper for the Nazi.</p>

<p>Can see the Jewish mentality?</p>

<p>I won&#39;t say you have lost your mind, obviously you bran is still functioning since you still can ploy and carry out heinous crimes... One thing for sure - <strong>You have lost your humanity</strong>.</p>

<p>You&#39;re lowest of all lows ... Repent before it&#39;s too late.</p>

<p>My answer to you is - You need to learn history before you speak, stop trying to make excuses because in all honesty you dont give a flying fuck about Palestinians or any other Arab people, so at least be honest with yourself, and a life without religion is great because I don&#39;t need a fairytale to have a meaning for life.

<p><strong>Confirmed: Fake Jews Do Not Believe In God</strong></p>

<p>But they insisted &quot;You need to learn <strong>history</strong>&quot;. What is their history? It&#39;s the same &quot;Fairytale&quot; which I believe he calls Torah/Talmud.</p>

<p>Hello, when is the God that promised you the land available to testify in court? We are waiting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Israel and Palestine has always been muticultural. But the Israelis do not like Palestinians and like Sudanese refugees even less. They import lots of different people for cheap labor and sex. From surprising places. It&#39;s a harem, like Hollywood. They fill their inadequacies with a dominance-establishing transactions. </p>

<p>Anyway, I don&#39;t think multicultural is the right word. Israel is a special case. </p>

<p>As for the diapora agents of globalism. They are highly visible and highly manageable. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because you don&#39;t tell a cheese maker that he needs to make cheese for a living. Israel is one of the most multicultural countries in the world. It&#39;s probably the last that needs to be lectured on that.</p>

<p>A quarter of its population is Arab, and the Jews are strongly split between African/Arab (Moroccan, Yemeni, Iraqi, Ethiopian), Eastern European (Russian, Ukrainian, Polish, Lithuanian), Western European (French, Spanish), American (American, Brazilian, Argentinian), and I&#39;ve seen quite a few Indian Jews. </p>

<p>Even the Arabs are strongly split between Bedouin, Druze, Lebanese, and Palestinian. </p>

<p>How do you even get more multicultural than that?</p>

<p>But it also begs the question; Why would any country strive to be multicultural? Split societies can hardly come to an effective agreement. If the country is busy arguing, there is no progress. </p>

<p>Israel should stay the way it is, but prevent illegal immigrants from entering the country. Same goes for everyone else. Only accept those who are willing to assimilate. </p>
