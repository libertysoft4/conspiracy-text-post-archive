<p>Now for some quickmaffs. The front-page has 25 posts (for OUR discussion, at least, as it changes with your settings). The front-page is entirely refreshed approximately every 8 hours (this is a very conservative estimate, in fact they change much more, but let&#39;s not overextend here). That means 75 posts a day are front-page content.</p>

<p>The_Donald was founded in June 2015. If you consider how long it has been active leading up to the election starting in July of 2015, you get 450 days. That&#39;s 450 days of 75 front-page posts, which gives us 33,750 front-page posts since being active.</p>

<p>Well, these &quot;Russian meddlers&quot; managed to make up a whopping 00.015% of all front-page posts on The_Donald. So a little more than 1% of 1% of all content. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would say so, yes. A 00.015% rate of bamboozle (RoB) is quite incredible, especially when you remember that not every @TEN_GOP contained false information. So while 00.015% of all information that the average reader of T_D would come across was from the Russian agitator outlets <strong>that we know about so far</strong>, that doesn&#39;t imply 00.015% of the information was false. Two of the five front-page posts, for instance, regarding Hulk Hogan and Trump donating to a marine, are true stories. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah. People were denying meddling back when the narrative was about russia hacking the DNC/Voting machines. Very serious types of things.</p>

<p>Now its shifted to facebook ads. Which are dwarfed to normal political campaigns, and something that every country does routinely (like the US). So the trolls come out and call out &quot;trump supporters&quot; for not admitting there is some sort of collusion... on something that has shifted to being completely stupid and irrelevant.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hope you are paid to say this shit, if you aren’t then this is just sad.</p>

<p>“No ties to Russians were proven.</p>

<p>No ties to these Russians exist.”</p>

<p>This isn’t remotely true and hasn’t been for a while.
E.g:
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/09/23/what-we-know-about-the-21-states-targeted-by-russian-hackers/?utm_term=.36fbe7e3391b">https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/09/23/what-we-know-about-the-21-states-targeted-by-russian-hackers/?utm_term=.36fbe7e3391b</a></p>

<p>I’ve seen you and others try to misled people by making out this is nothing more than a dozen troll accounts. when The latest charges relate to management of the troll farms themselves, not the low level employees.</p>

<p>There is no evidence of the Russians indicted being tied to Trump in your link.</p>

<p>In fact there is no concrete evidence at all stated in your link.</p>

<p>You honestly fucking think that because you post a link people will go ahead and buy whatever you said as evidence? I read your article and it has nothing substantial in it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good post.</p>

<p>Like I said in the other post about this, you also need to take in to account that people who hang around T_D have already made up their mind. These aren&#39;t swing voters that had a chance of voting for Hillary.</p>

<p>So, yes, of course they were sharing content that agreed with them. Every subreddit does that.</p>

<p>Also, since the twitter account has been suspended, we can&#39;t see how much of what they were posting was fake. From the titles, we can see that a lot of what they were posting is true. They were simply posting video clips from debates and things like that.</p>

<p>If a Russian posts something that is true, does it automatically become false?</p>

<p>Of course you don&#39;t want any kind of foreign interference in elections, but it&#39;s just naive to think that&#39;s a realistic objective to have when we&#39;re so connected now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fuck, these are all valid points. Better downvote your comment.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t even think of this. If Russians are trying to shill, they are not using their money wisely. Posting pro trump shit to t_d is preaching to the choir. There&#39;s literally 0 to gain</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for your analysis. You make some good points.</p>

<p>For completeness sake I should mention the fact that (because of Reddit&#39;s shitty search function) the list I posted of the 241 posts yesterday was incomplete. There were actually many more, which the  resourceful <a href="/u/f_k_a_g_n">/u/f_k_a_g_n</a> was able to find using BigQuery.</p>

<p>So as well as those 23 posts made prior to the election, there was also another 55 lower scoring posts made before the election for a grand total of 78 posts.</p>

<p>Those 55 extra posts would all fit in your third group, so they would not really affect your rhetorical strategy of focusing on front page posts, but here are all 78 posts  in a list on GitHub kindly made by <a href="/u/f_k_a_g_n">/u/f_k_a_g_n</a>:</p>
