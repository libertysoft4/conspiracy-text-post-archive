I don’t know much about all these shootings but I’m sure they felt just as bad if not worse as the rest of the world when they heard about the incident. Then to learn it was your kid?!

    <div class="md"><p>Fuck man this world pisses me off so much. I hate how brainwashed people are and it’s like mandatory that we have to feel sad for victims of mass shootings. How many people die a year from mass shootings? Probably less than 200. Now let’s compare that to the 90,000 alcohol related deaths per year. Big difference right, but people get so emotional over these mass shootings, many of them have a lot of fishy things going on in the official narratives. </p>

<p>The point is I can live with a few mass shootings each year, because it’s better than giving up our freedom only so we can given even more power to US government funded institutions like the FBI. You know the same US government that has reportedly and ruthlessly killed about 20 million people since World War 2 ended. </p>

<p>I hope im not Alone in this but it kinda feels like very few people are as logical as I am when it comes to this whole mass shooting discussion </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wouldn’t care if I lost a family member to a mass shooting. It’s an almost unavoidable event if it happens. Just like if I lost a family member in a car accident, what exactly would I try and do about it?? Advocate for banning roads? </p>

<p>It is so rare and you are playing the if this happens game or the if that happens I bet you would feel a lot different. It hasn’t happened yet and it doesn’t happen. Do you know anyone who has lost a family member or has died in a mass shooting? No, you don’t because it rarely happens, and sometimes when it does happen it is a complete hoax, like we saw with Sandy Hook. </p>

<p>Just don’t rely on institutions like the FBI to save you from a possible suspect online who’s posting disturbing things. Like wtf. You have to rely on yourself to be prepared, don’t beg for government to save u</p>

You care more about the families of the 17 kids than you do about the millions of people suffering in unbearable and chaotic conditions in Venezuela.

But you have the nerve to claim that I don’t care about anyone other than myself? No, you have it all wrong. I’m just saying we need to get our proportions right here.

    <div class="md"><p>Even if you were to only focus on issues within the country, this is a very minor ordeal. There are 44 homicide deaths, 90 car accident deaths, and 1,645 cancer deaths on average each day in the USA. Yet everyone is zoned in on this singular tragic event. It’s artificially hyped up by the media, and you know it. You’re brainwashed, just admit it.</p>

<p>Also if you were worried about this country you would be more concerned about stopping the lunatics at the top, not the lunatics at the bottom of the pyramid. The lunatics like the people who run the federal reserve, and the few hundred giant capitalists that own all the factories, all the shares, and all the newspapers. These scumbags also drive America into extremely costly wars and they finance both sides on many occasions. These are also the very same scumbags that own the media that hypes up this most recent mass shooting. I hope you get red pilled just a little by this but you are very brainwashed and it will take a lot to change your world view into something that isn’t divorced from reality </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude, again, it’s possible to care about more than one thing at once. I lean very left and would love to see this country move away from its unfettered capitalism towards a more socialist-capitalist structure. I’m well aware of the plutocracy we reside in. </p>

<p>Also, everyone is zoned in on our mass shooting problem because it’s our only problem that we’re doing nothing about. Homicides? They’re trending down. Car accident deaths? Cars get safer every year and regulations are put in place to make sure of that. Cancer deaths? We’re working on solutions towards that but the wheels of innovation turn slowly. Mass shootings? Crickets. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What do you mean we’re doing nothing about it? We’re talking about this stuff every day. There’s proposals being made every day. Do we need metal detectors in schools? Do we need to give the FBI the power to arrest anyone who makes a threatening post on social media? Do we need to make even more gun laws and restrictions on people who can get a gun? I tend to think that all of this is a violation of privacy and it completely puts safety over liberty, and that is something I’m not a fan of. I can live with a few mass shootings a year because whether you like it or not it’s just not that big of a problem. You hate when I say it but it’s true. Mass shootings are not a big problem. </p>

<p>Of course you lean left. Leftists tend to lack critical thinking skills as they favor putting their emotions before logic and they fear offending any group of people that they deem a “persecuted minority”. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, we’re really not doing a thing to prevent them. I think the gun ownership should be a privilege, not a right, but any instance of someone putting forth meaningful legislation to work towards that is either laughed down or just shut out. The healthcare system in this country, as it currently is, will never allow people, especially the disadvantaged, to use it easily and readily to treat mental illness. Nothing is being done to alleviate that. </p>

<p>Also, I don’t really know how else to tell you but you REALLY should care more about your fellow countrymen. The statistical likelihood of their possible death doesn’t matter. All innocent deaths have equal weight and should have equal measures to prevent them from happening again. It’s really not cool or edgy or “logical” to not care about people; it just makes you look like a lonely asshole. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Less is more less is more less is more. I bet you agree with President Trumps proposal to lower the cost of prescription drugs. I don’t. Many of these drugs likely lead to even more mental illness and more crazy behavior and more overdoses and more death and more despair. The quality of health care does not determine the health of a nation ok. We spend way too much on health care already. The government spends probably a trillion dollars a year on health, but it isn’t helping because it seems like Americans are getting more and more obese each year and the average lifespan of Americans is actually going down, that is a recent trend. More money into healthcare does not mean it’s better necessarily. It’s probably time for people to get off the pills and the drugs and the anti depressants if anything. </p>

<p>How do we fix health? We improve the quality of food. I also think part of the mental health problem has to do with just people having less money and income inequality. The percentage of disposable income for people in the bottom 90% of America continues to go down each year. Wouldn’t you think it’s just a natural trend that we see more extremists as America devolves into something other than a 1st world country?</p>

<p>Still as of now mass shootings are not a big problem in America they probably measure at around a .5 on the Richter scale of America’s problems. The biggest problem being central bank collusion with S&amp;P 500 corporations along with massive military spending to fight wars that benefit us in no way. And one of the smallest problems being mass shootings </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’d agree that the quality of healthcare doesn’t determine the health of a nation. Despite us spending a metric fuckton on it, the average lifespan of an American is decreasing because of lack of coverage. The best healthcare in the world won’t save someone who can’t access it. Our private insurance, which is outrageously expensive and covers jack shit, is breaking the health of this nation. And it of course disproportionately affects the poor. Under a single-payer system, all could be covered and pursue the means to treat their physical and mental health. </p>

<p>I’d also agree on getting people off of a lot of pills as well. More specifically, opioids. Anti-depressants did wonders for me though. The problem is the over prescription of highly addictive drugs. </p>

<p>I’d also agree that income inequality negatively affects someone’s mental health. Add in a lack of affordable education, housing, and childcare and we’d agree even more. Nothing wrecks someone’s mental health in the long term like poverty does. </p>

<p>Apart from all of that though. I saw one of your previous posts about your self harm. Reach out to me man. Self harm gripped me for three years and I wouldn’t wish that shit on anyone. I know it’s hard to talk about but seriously, reach out man. </p>

<p>Okay, then I will proceed to not take anything else you say seriously in the slightest. That was the point you intended, right?</p>

<p>It&#39;s not what you were saying, it&#39;s the way you seem to only use these 
accusations about &quot;emotion&quot; and such to get what you want, moment by moment. There&#39;s no discernible principle behind any of it.

It’s why they vehemently defend Transgenders and discrimination against Transgenders despite the fact that they have a 44% attempted suicide rate and in all likelihood have a mental illness that needs to be addressed with something other than a surgical gender changing procedure.

At the end of the day though a life is a life and nobody wants to see a shooting of any kind especially when you’re involving children. That’s heart breaking. Things need to change because this world is sick. I don’t know how we all agree to live under a government that is willing to feed its population a stick of tobacco that is filled with nothing but deadly chemicals and poisons. Willingly and knowingly that this will cause sickness and death in a mass scale and turn around and charge us for treatment. This is one small example of course but, where did we go wrong. At what point in time did we start caring about a government that could care less about us. You can explode your brain the further down the rabbit hole you go thinking about stuff like this.

    <div class="md"><p>Not saying that these events didn&#39;t happen but I do believe the narrative on all these events lately has been gun control and now its pushing for better profiling of people to stop the &quot;maniac&quot; before he acts. Its just a constant barrage of increasingly more fucked up events to wear down the psyche until everyone mentally is tired of fighting for freedom and ready to give up their rights for any false sense of security TPTB can offer them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it could largely be explained by three factors: the copy-cat effect, law enforcement not wanting to guess wrong on the real thing, and national media paying more attention because of the recency of the Florida shooting. </p>

<p>For at least some portion of these school shooters (or at least what we&#39;re led to believe), at least part of the motivation is fame of some sort. These are boys and young men with troubled lives and little prospects, and seeing the attention, even and maybe especially the revulsion these shooters get can seem a good alternative to their lives of quiet desperation.</p>

<p>Second, local police and the FBI have been heavily criticized over their lack of response to reports and warning signs. Events like this will always lead to increased and even excessive vigilance. That&#39;s just human nature and not wanting to get caught with their pants down, especially when the whole country is watching. The same probably goes for parents or relatives. </p>

<p>In my local news market of maybe a couple million people, it seems at least a few times a year there&#39;s a story about a kid getting arrested for a bomb threat or school shooting plot. None of these make national news. Extrapolate that out to the whole country, and you probably have an arrest like this a few times a week, maybe even daily. Normally, none of these reaches national news, but in the aftermath of an actual shooting, they get picked up because the newspeople find it relevant to the current &quot;outrage of the week.&quot; People will view and click on these stories this week, while two weeks ago they would have gotten a tenth of the attention, even if the stories were promoted the same. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is nobody here familiar with the fact that America created terrorism? Every kind of terrorism, from 9/11 to school shootings. </p>

<p>You&#39;ll find that MSM&#39;s (distorted) portrayal of events leads everyone into thinking terrorism happens due to existing gun laws and protection force failure. So they shovel more money into funding the military force, push for weapon ban, and suddenly your entire life is in the state&#39;s hands. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They say it&#39;s about &quot;gun control&quot; no they won&#39;t be able to take em all away, they can make more laws and what not but the end game is purely to drive fear into the people. We can&#39;t even blame Isis for an attack anymore because people finally got the idea that they are u.s. created and financed. So we&#39;re going back to school shootings. Soon it&#39;ll be the Mexicans and drug dealing African American communities again... and you rinse and repeat. Just to drive fear to keep police in work and eventually militrize them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>what is strange? i believe that this happens after 9/11 with muslims too. i believe that this is a common pattern of suspicion that arise with the fear of the population towards those groups.</p>
