<p><em>Don’t fuck with Russia</em></p>

<p>This investigation has not been able to come up with anything concrete, it’s been a year.. </p>

<p>Relations with Russia are better than they’ve been in 10 years.. as far as Trump goes, yet the media gunning for war. What do they get out of a war with Russia? Nukes?</p>

<p>Why does the left want a confrontation with Russia? Like what happens if and when you <em>do</em> prove that they were “trying to spread discord” (something we do to everyone)? </p>

<p>You finna’ invade Russia? Really?</p>

<p>Best of luck, SJWs. If 3 million well trained Nazi supersoldiers can’t do it... if hordes of Mongol warriors can’t do it.... if Napoleon, arguably the greatest military mind in history can’t do it....</p>

<p>I’m sure you have a chance. </p>

<p>Anybody got Putin’s thoughts?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol, no one needs to go to war with Russia. Russia is a shit hole that is only relevant because they have nukes. Their economy is a dumpster fire that isn&#39;t getting any better thanks to falling oil prices. Just sanction them and they&#39;ll fall apart like the USSR. Then a few people can sell off all the government property and get rich enough to become the new ruling class, continuing the endless cycle of unbridled fuckery that is Russian history. </p>

<p>They&#39;re just people. Yeah, so their government has done wicked things but Putin (the dictator that he is) has at least tried to soften their society to a degree. </p>

<p>I would NOT underestimate them. Putin’s built shelter underground enough to fit 40 million people: do you see our government doing that?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Man it&#39;s really frustrating reading all the responses to you here. I have a hard time believing organic users of r/conspiracy are so xenophobic and war hungry. We have the nerve to criticize Russia when we break our promises on NATO expansion and surround them with weapons. While we occupy 1000 based around the world that we even know of. While we spend 10x the amount they do on military. While we crushed any and all attempts from post USSR Russia to reduce the nuclear weapons threat. Russia isn&#39;t the threat too world peace. We are. Everyone outside the US knows it. And guess what? I don&#39;t want to see a Russian human bombed or hurt the same way I don&#39;t want to see a North Korean bombed or hurt. Russia&#39;s problem right now is they&#39;ve got our number. They know we value MIC profits over peace and the war on terror just ain&#39;t selling like it used to. They badly want cold war 2, but they&#39;re playing with literal nuclear fire. Whatever happened to the anti war movement in this country? And how the fuck do people still trust ore intelligence agencies when it comes to anything? Sorry for the rant OP - I just get weirded out by the voting patterns and comments you&#39;re getting for factual level-headed statements in favor of not ramping up our rhetoric with Russia.</p>

<p>Only because of the ruling class. Russia could easily have a median household income of $35,000-40,000 if they let the people get the most out of their government/resources.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Quit with that bullshit Western propaganda. Russia never &quot;rolled tanks&quot; into Ukraine, nor did they invade or anything like that. Ukraine voted in referendum to rejoin (yes, rejoin - ie. they were once a part of Russia and ethnic Russians make up the majority in Crimea). </p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimea#Demographics">In 2001, there was 60% ethnic Russians compared to 24% ethnic Ukranians.</a>. </p>

<p>They voted, because of what was going on in the Ukrainian government, and what was going on in greater Ukraine (ie. the rise of extreme Ukrainian Nationalism). In which, groups such as Svoboda, Azov Battalion, and others were actively persecuting ethnic Russians. People such as <a href="http://www.sott.net/image/image/s8/167237/large/5pHagsg.jpg">this</a>, <a href="http://i44.tinypic.com/2ez1m3k.jpg">this</a>, and <a href="http://defendinghistory.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/march_111015_2-2.jpg">this</a>, for an example. That&#39;s why they voted to rejoin Russia. Not because big bad Russia invaded them. They choose it, as is their right. </p>

<p>Stop drinking the Western propaganda kool-aid, and actually educate yourself...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>russia went by invitation of the crimean people, who are mostly ethic russians, not ethinic ukrainians as is the case with the rest of ukraine. </p>

<p>after the meydan coup that we backed and financed, crimea, out of faurly legitimate fear, held a referendum to secede from ukraine, which passed. no territory has been taken beyond crimea, nor threatened.</p>

<p>ethnic ukraines do not like ethnic russians. the neo-nazi ukrainian group that victoria nuland gave millions to on our behalf liked to go on about how there should be no ethnic russians in ukraine. full stop. right before the coup, a law declaring russian the 2nd official language of ukraine passed. the nazi&#39;s go bat shit. the coup succeeds. repeal of the law is the very first thing they do. an-anti meydan rally is held, those same meydan neo-nazi&#39;s went there, chased them into the closest building, set it on fire and burned them to death.</p>

<p>&quot;Naturally the common people don&#39;t want war: Neither in Russia, nor in England, nor for that matter in Germany. That is understood. But, after all, IT IS THE LEADERS of the country who determine the policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along, whether it is a democracy, or a fascist dictatorship, or a parliament, or a communist dictatorship. Voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is TELL THEM THEY ARE BEING ATTACKED, and denounce the peacemakers for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger. IT WORKS THE SAME IN ANY COUNTRY.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Both the US and Russian governments know that they can never have an actual all out war with each other.  The important thing is that US and Russian citizens don&#39;t know that.. Because as long as that is the case both governments can use that fear to manipulate each others people.  Like for instance, if one nation wanted to help their buddy Israel, and also some of it&#39;s own very wealthy citizens gain access to a rich Syrian oilfield by illegally invading and overthrowing a sovereign government, but can&#39;t.. because the other nation is good friends with that sovereign government.. Well that nation could just spout off a bunch of bullshit about hacked elections and <em>totally real</em> gas attacks to convince it&#39;s citizens not get pissed when they <em>Accidentally</em> start blowing up that other countries shit in said sovereign country.</p>
