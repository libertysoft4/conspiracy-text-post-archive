    <div class="md"><p>Oh ok gotcha, so those crazy gridwork patterns being made in the sky are just commercial flights criss-crossing and flying way above the usual airspace. Makes sense! Especially since these planes are always small, pure white, and marked with no commercial logos. And it&#39;s so weird because when I see a Delta plane flying above my head, their contrails usually dissipate. Guess I&#39;m just an idiot ;) Yeahhhh... Thanks bud! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow, almost as if there are thousands of planes flying along published routes called airways, aka &quot;highways in the sky&quot; and are too high to make out any markings with the naked eye. Ever heard of flight aware or flightradar24?

    <div class="md"><p>Commercial airliners don&#39;t leave lasting trails. Your strategy to take advantage of what is left unclear about my statements is quite sly and political. Obviously the grid patterns left in the sky by these unique and non-commercial planes are not consistent with air traffic patterns, but why am I even arguing with you? You have an emotional (or financial, or karmic) attachment to untruth so that&#39;s not my problem and I don&#39;t care what conclusion you make of me based on my decision not to argue with you over what I have seen. Thanks for recommending that app though. Might come in handy. </p>

In fact, bombers in WW2 had problems with contrails due to the fact that they had strength in numbers but on particularly humid days, those massive trails were like a huge beacon to the enemy basically saying &quot;here I am!&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

<p>Yes they do. Contrails last as long as conditions allow. Jet fuel is very similar to paraffin (kerosene); it is a hydrocarbon - a complex mix of carbon and hydrogen. When it burns in air it breaks apart and the carbon combines with oxygen to expand into carbon dioxide gas (CO2) and the hydrogen combines with oxygen to form water (H2O). These two reactions give off a great deal of heat energy. 1 kilo of aviation fuel combines with oxygen to produce about 3.5 kilos of CO2 gas and 1.2 kilos of water which boils instantly into 1,600 litres of superheated steam. It is these rapidly expanding hot gases which push the aircraft forward. At high altitudes where the temperature is minus 50 degrees the steam will freeze into tiny ice crystals almost instantly. If the air is dry the crystals will disappear in seconds through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sublimation_(phase_transition">sublimation</a>, but if the air is saturated with water vapour then the crystals will grow many times in size into snowflakes through the opposite process called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deposition_(phase_transition">deposition</a> and can last for hours or even days in a distinct formation. This is a contrail. It does not require any sinister chemicals to make it form. How long a contrail lasts depends on temperature, pressure, and humidity, and nothing else. A 747 burns around 11 tons of fuel per hour, which convert to around 13 tons of ice, which is around 24 kg per mile. It is a tiny amount compared with the thousands of tons of ice in a contrail, but only 0.003% of the water in a persistent contrail comes from the burnt fuel; the other 99.997% is from the atmosphere itself. It&#39;s not hard to see how a jet liner spewing fire and ice can leave a huge spectacular cloud behind it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is great science, and awesome to share your knowledge like that. Thank you for informing me. </p>

<p>Unfortunately the details of your explanation don&#39;t stand up to mine and others&#39; experience. That is that these chemtrails occur during every season, they dissipate in such a way as to create an artificial haze serving as cloud cover, and they occur at various levels in the atmosphere regardless of temperature, humidity, or any other condition. It should be relatively easy to catch a moment in the sky where a chemtrail aircraft is spewing while a commercial aircraft flies by without emitting any trace of cloud. </p>

<p>As I have already pointed out these planes are distinctly different from commercial airliners and your argument that my vision is poor is simply baseless. Weather manipulation/spraying by special planes has been proven, not only in the above video but also in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWqJ9XvJ_X8">weather reports</a>. </p>

<p>That is all the energy I have to devote to the topic. It is up to people to decide their interpretation of events, so I would suggest that if you want to change people&#39;s minds, you do it in a way that does not include calling them out as &quot;morons&quot;. </p>

<p>PS: I&#39;ll be surprised if you don&#39;t write another comment to get in the last word. </p>

<p>Look young fella... I&#39;ve lived this particular puppy for twenty adult years. You go out in wide open country day after day, look up at the sky, and watch what happens. Millions of people have this &quot;scientific&quot; opportunity to watch a half dozen aircraft turn a blue sky into grey haze. But what they do with their eye-witness account is classic psyop internalization - they cannot talk about it because they are told by seemingly expert authorities like you that they must be stupid, unscientific, illogical, naive, misled, over-exaggerating dipshits. This induces classic cognitive dissonance due to abuse. And you&#39;re the abuser. Just stop it. Send back the money and feel a little better about yourself.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not that at all and there is no evidence for any of those things. Contrails last as long as conditions allow. Jet fuel is very similar to paraffin (kerosene); it is a hydrocarbon - a complex mix of carbon and hydrogen. When it burns in air it breaks apart and the carbon combines with oxygen to expand into carbon dioxide gas (CO2) and the hydrogen combines with oxygen to form water (H2O). These two reactions give off a great deal of heat energy. 1 kilo of aviation fuel combines with oxygen to produce about 3.5 kilos of CO2 gas and 1.2 kilos of water which boils instantly into 1,600 litres of superheated steam. It is these rapidly expanding hot gases which push the aircraft forward. At high altitudes where the temperature is minus 50 degrees the steam will freeze into tiny ice crystals almost instantly. If the air is dry the crystals will disappear in seconds through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sublimation_(phase_transition">sublimation</a>, but if the air is saturated with water vapour then the crystals will grow many times in size into snowflakes through the opposite process called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deposition_(phase_transition">deposition</a> and can last for hours or even days in a distinct formation or merge into a solid layer of haze. This is a contrail. It does not require any sinister chemicals to make it form. How long a contrail lasts depends on temperature, pressure, and humidity, and nothing else. A 747 burns around 11 tons of fuel per hour, which convert to around 13 tons of ice, which is around 24 kg per mile. It is a tiny amount compared with the thousands of tons of ice in a contrail, but only 0.003% of the water in a persistent contrail comes from the burnt fuel; the other 99.997% is from the atmosphere itself. It&#39;s not hard to see how a jet liner spewing fire and ice can leave a huge spectacular cloud behind it.</p>

<p>Multi-decadal model calculations for the 1990–2010 period are performed with the coupled WRF-CMAQ modeling system over a domain encompassing the northern hemisphere and a nested domain over the continental U.S. Simulated trends in ozone and precursor species concentrations across the U.S. over the past two decades are compared with those inferred from available measurements during this period. The model results suggest large and contrasting changes in tropospheric composition over the northern hemisphere with significant reductions in air pollution over North America and Western Europe and increase in large portions of Asia. The model is able to capture the changing seasonal distributions in surface O3 in the U.S. during 1990–2010 arising from changing emissions and long-range transport.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not getting into any debate, just have a question. If contrails require humid air, why are there variations in visibility on days when weather conditions are consistent in the desert? For example, if say, one is in a desert type environment and today the sky is grid marked, but tomorrow in similar to near identical conditions it is crystal clear. Say both days are weekdays, with similar flight patterns. I&#39;ve witnessed this and I&#39;m genuinely curious.</p>

In fact, for thunderstorms to form, they need high humidity, unstable air and convective currents to a high altitude to form those big clouds, all of which might not be felt on the ground until the storm occurs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe research a little more before taking the word of TPTB and assuming something is harmless because they say so.</p>

<p>&quot;Silver iodide (AgI) is a yellow, inorganic, photosensitive iodide of silver used in photography, in medicine as an antiseptic, and in rainmaking for cloud seeding.  The crystalline structure of AgI is similar to that of ice, allowing it to induce freezing in cloud seeding for the purpose of rainmaking. Approximately 50,000 kg/year are used for this purpose.</p>

<p>Under the guidelines of the United States Environmental Protection Agency Clean Water Act, silver iodide is considered a hazardous substance, a priority pollutant, and a toxic pollutant.</p>

<p>A key manufacturer of silver iodide for weather modification, Deepwater Chemicals, warns of potential health effects of silver iodide in their Material Safety Data Sheet as follows:  Chronic ingestion of iodides may produce “iodism”, (chronic poisoning by iodine or iodides) which may be manifested by skin rash, running nose, headache, irritation of the mucous membranes, weakness, anemia, loss of weight and general depression. Chronic inhalation, ingestion or skin contact with silver compounds may cause argyria characterized by blue-gray discoloration of the eyes, skin and mucous membranes.&quot;</p>

<p>You are implying that one needs to ingest a great amount of silver iodide in order to be harmed and that is incorrect.

<p>In July, the state’s minister of revenue, Eknath Khadse, took a gamble: He hired Koliwad to carry out a $4.5 million cloud-seeding program over three months and across 100 square miles in the middle of the state, the largest campaign of this kind ever attempted in India.  </p>

<p>AND</p>

<p>Despite the uncertainty, the industry is on the rise. According to the World Meteorological Organization, more than 52 countries have active cloud-seeding operations—up from 42 four years ago. In the U.S. last year, 55 cloud-seeding projects were reported to NOAA. There’s even a luxury cloud-seeding market emerging—one European company, for instance, charges a minimum of $150,000 to guarantee good wedding weather by forcing clouds to rain in the days before the event.</p>

<p>AND</p>

<p>They do have competitors. There are 34 private companies worldwide that do weather modification, but there’s no bigger rival in aerial cloud seeding than the Chinese government, which spends hundreds of millions a year seeding clouds in 22 of its 23 provinces, both to clear pollution above cities and to enhance rainfall for farming. China has yet to allow private companies to enter its market, but Sweeney is making inroads; he sold his first cloud-seeding plane to Beijing last year.</p>

<p>(These companies aren&#39;t sitting on their asses all day long).</p>

<p>AND </p>

<p>Since he got his pilot’s license in 1974, he’s flown more than 6,000 hours of cloud-seeding expeditions. </p>

<p>(Just one pilot)</p>

<p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2015-cloud-seeding-india/">https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2015-cloud-seeding-india/</a></p>

<p>Who else is doing weather modification?</p>

<p>The latest data from the World Meteorological Organization compiled in 2000 listed 74 projects ongoing in 23 countries worldwide (WMO, 2000). In 2001 the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) documented 66 projects conducted in the western U.S. Project objectives included fog dispersal, snowpack and rainfall enhancement, and hail suppression.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nawmc.org/faq/">http://www.nawmc.org/faq/</a></p>

<p>Counties in these U.S. states have conducted and/or still conduct extended cloud-seeding programs:</p>

<p>California Colorado Georgia Hawaii Idaho Illinois Iowa Kansas Montana Nevada New Mexico North Dakota Oklahoma Oregon South DakotaTexas Utah Washington Wyoming</p>

<p>Most other states have also experimented with weather modification. </p>

<p>&quot;South of San Antonio, we had aircraft flying on a dozen days in the month of July treating what we deemed to be seedable storms.“</p>

<p><a href="https://consciouslifenews.com/weather-modification-aka-chemtrails-big-business-paid-taxes/1165331/">https://consciouslifenews.com/weather-modification-aka-chemtrails-big-business-paid-taxes/1165331/</a></p>

<p>The UAE’s NCMS last year had six pilots and six Beechcraft King Air c90 aircraft for its cloud seeding drills, which commence as soon as meteorologists forecast cloudy weather.</p>

<p>(All it takes is cloudy weather, but we know they do it on crystal clear days as well).</p>

<p>&quot;Arabian Business can reveal that the UAE conducted 101 cloud seeding operations in the first quarter of 2017, compared to 77 in the same period last year. Thirty-one flights were made during the last week of rain from March 20-28, says the NCMS, while the average number of cloud seeding flights made in the UAE each year is between 160 and 200.&quot;</p>

<p>AND</p>

<p>&quot;The UAE spent $558,000 on cloud seeding operations in 2015, Farrah told Arabian Business last year, but, with the uptick in operations since, this year’s budget is likely to be higher. The NCMS declines to reveal its budget for 2017, but provides information on the value of water produced from cloud seeding.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Congrats, you&#39;re still showing me what I already know, which is that weather modification, aka cloud seeding, is a real thing. What&#39;s commonly referred to as chemtrails, which is high altitude contrails by airliners, is what the initial argument was. Those chemtrails aren&#39;t real.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You asked for sources on my claim that this was being done nearly every day. Glad you admit it is being done and tgat silver iodide is a harmful chemical. Chemtrails are the trails left by cloud-seeding which contains silver iodide as well as other harmful chemicals that are being measured in vast amounts in farm soil.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alright, so to be clear, you think that the trails coming from a high flying aircraft&#39;s engine contain these chemicals? Because they don&#39;t and they aren&#39;t unmarked.
