        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>As someone who frequently lurks on most of reddit, as in never commenting &amp; only posting. I have discovered some curious trends to say the least that are incredibly telling about how warped the masses today are. Lets begin!</p>

<p>“Questioning the official Holocaust story makes you a anti-semetic denier”</p>

<p>Starting out with the obvious one, this seems to be the biggest censored topic on the entire sight. People are completely brainwashed on this beyond human comprehension, you are not allowed to question this event in any shape or form or you will be instantly downvote brigaded by “shills” screaming how much of a asshole you are because apparently questioning it makes you an instant denier, you are just supposed to accept it &amp; throw away your common sense. Also i rarely ever hear Stalin’s attrocities mentioned, i see people acted shocked whenever their told of ussr’s crimes in ww2. Because they seem largely uniformed about the entire war aside from Hitler killing jews, which seems to be the only thing everyone is aware of.</p>

<p>“Reddit totally isn’t pro-MSM”</p>

<p>This is the scariest one, they are incredibly defensive of msm news, like as in they aren’t mentally capable of comprehending information that goes against the official narrative so they in turn begin to personally attack you &amp; censor your opinions with the downvote button. Media manipulation is scarily powerful, if it isn’t reported by the msm they will always believe its false.</p>

<p>“Muh lizard people &amp; flat earth”</p>

<p>This one seems to be incredibly popular, there is a huge pushback from people who do everything in their absolute power to shame &amp; ridicule people who provide evidence and genuinely believe things that don’t support the government lies &amp; propaganda. Which leads them to use the time old weaponized “conspiracy theorist” label as a way to somehow devalue you’re opinion as if it means less then theirs. Which is also followed by them making fun of the flat earth &amp; lizard people “conspiracy” which apparently is used to shame you even more to make you look like an insane person even though no theorists actually believe this. This has extended to even fully hate-filled subreddits dedicated to hatejerking them, like topminds</p>

<p>“The federal reserve is good”</p>

<p>This is also a common belief on Reddit, most people are incredibly defensive &amp; pro federal reserve, insisting that they are helping our countries future. </p>

<p>“Greed isn’t the problem &amp; the government  isn’t capable of that”</p>

<p>Gonna overlap these two here, first what I commonly see repeated on reddit is the extreme undermining of corporate greed. People absolutely do not like it when you insinuate that this is the cause for a huge majority of our problems in the world. Like people will downvote anyone to hell who attacks corporate greed which doesn’t make any sense to me.
Second, people seem to think that the government couldn’t possibly be capable of keeping terrorist acts a secret on a large scale &amp; constantly repeat the msm beliefs in their own government’s defense when any conspiracy is mentioned. Now the popular thing seems to be using Trump as a scapegoat for all of the horrible things in the US, as if he is somehow the one plotting all of it by himself. People are convinced that he is the worst human possible &amp; will bring the apocalypse upon us all. </p>

<p>“Israel did nothing wrong”</p>

<p>And for my final point, Israel. You can absolutely not criticize them in any shape or form, Reddit is incredibly defensive of this to the point of it being nearly cult like. People seem to hate the idea of anyone standing up for the rights of palestians &amp; have this sick &amp; warped sense of morality that somehow its Palestine’s fault for not bending over &amp; taking Israel’s dick willingly. 
I’ve never seen such a digusting act by the mass public, people are blantantly turning a blind eye for the well-being of Palestines because apparently Israel can do no wrong &amp; the thought of jews controlling the world is a “nonsense conspiracy theory”. Which brings up my final point criticizing them in any way always gets you hit with the label of being an “anti-semetic” as people will quickly bring up the Holocaust &amp; mention how horrible it was as if that execuses Israel’s atrocities over the years.</p>

<p>Just my thoughts, i personally think this is a conspiracy at how the state of our world really has become.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very astute, and quite correct, observation. You are one hundred percent correct on all counts. It should be mentioned that the great majority of the people on Reddit have an IQ of between 90 and 100. This makes them mentally incapable of higher thought. As such they must rely on others (MSM, Government, School etc) to do their thinking for them. Also, they must rely on the &quot;herd mentality&quot;. Anyone who strays from the accepted common narrative is to be shunned. Good post.</p>

<p>people who live in crowded environments (cities) have abnormally high oxytocin production, its hypothetical but it could be whats causing the “look to others for problem/solution instead of myself” perspective that you see in cities and population-dense areas.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Things in the sky and Eratosthenes experiment aren&#39;t empirical evidence for earth curvature though, they are just observations that you can plug into either model. That&#39;s the interesting thing about flat earth is people don&#39;t even understand the standard cosmological model, or the flat earth model, it&#39;s just a religious belief in scientism. Much like objects disappearing in the distance, that&#39;s due to perspective but it&#39;s very common for people to think it&#39;s from earth curvature. Whether the eart is flat or round you could convince the majority of people of the opposite easily with fake proofs. I am a flat earther though, I used to think it was round like most everyone and I could change my mind again, but once I started working my way through round earth proofs it became clear it&#39;s not as cut and dry as it&#39;s made out to be. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>But things <strong>do</strong> disappear in the distance because of the earth&#39;s curvature.</p>

<p>Flat earthers always seem to confuse resolution and perspective.</p>

<p>Yes, if an object is small enough, you won&#39;t be able to see it with the naked eye at a distance, and you can see it if you have some magnification and zoom in. This is because of our optical resolution.</p>

<p>However, if an object is actually <strong>large enough to see</strong> at a distance where it disappears over the horizon, it disappears bottom up. That&#39;s perspective.</p>

<p>The problem with flat earth arguments regarding this is that they always use small objects like boats at distances where they can be obscured by waves. For example, if you look at a skyscraper or tower while sailing away into the ocean, it will disappear over the horizon bottom up. This only works with a round earth.</p>

<p>Look at the CN Tower in Toronto when viewed from across Lake Ontario:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem with round earth arguments is they never have observable tilt to objects &quot;going over the curvature&quot;, and will use large objects that are enlarged by atmospheric lensing as proof they are more visible than they should be on a flat plane, the sun is a good example of that, and is often pointed to as something that doesn&#39;t get small enough nearing the horizon, but in low air moisture environments you can observe a shrinking sun.

    <div class="md"><p>upvoted because someone downvoted you without replying.</p>

<p>If an object is IN FACT disappearing over a curve, it should lean away from the observer. It never does. Just disappearing &quot;bottom-up&quot; does not prove curvature. Being able to zoom in and view it again denies curvature. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Flat earthers always seem to confuse resolution and perspective.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Perspective is the topic at hand. Due to our perspective it appears to vanish, yet it is still there with enough magnification. That is why, if a boat is far enough it looks like it&#39;s floating above the ocean. There is atmospheric distortion occurring above the water level, distorting your view of the bottom of the object. It is a very similar phenomenon to what happens with heatwaves on a long road, and cars appearing to vanish at distance, or sometimes just disappear from the ground to about the top of the wheels.. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Rob Skiba has a flawed understanding of how atmospheric magnification works. </p>

<p>The problem with his experiment is that he has the center (thicker middle part) of the lens <strong>above</strong> the table top. He should cut his lens in half horizontally so the center rests <strong>on</strong> the table top.</p>

<p>This would more accurately represent how atmospheric magnification is caused. It is caused a pocket of cooler, more dense air forming a bubble resembling the top half of a convex lens.</p>

<p>If he were to actually set up his experiment properly, it would show that the ground would still be visible when viewed from any distance. Since the earth is <strong>not</strong> flat, this isn&#39;t the case.</p>

My original intent in this &quot;argument&quot; was to try to explain to you why Rob Skiba&#39;s experiment was wrong and get you to do some research yourself.</p>

<p>It&#39;s totally fine to be skeptical. Questioning things is how we learn.</p>

<p>The main issue I have with flat earthers is that they don&#39;t question. They link a video defending their beliefs and treat is as fact because it is presented in an organized fashion.</p>

<p>Even if you wanted to attribute the magnification to atmospheric lensing, the bottom of large structures should still not fall below the horizon if there is no curvature. Given how the pocket of dense air acts like the top half of a convex lens with the thicker middle part closest to the ground, the angle that light is refracted at while viewing from close to the ground is minimal.</p>

<p>With a flat earth model, we would actually still be able to see the bottom of a skyscraper or large building at any distance, provided we have enough magnification and a clear line of sight.</p>

<p>There are a lot of people on this website, on youtube, and on other social media platforms, that are very serious about the idea.

<p>there is heaps of evidence that the earth is not a spinning ball. There are anomalies/lies/half-truths/etc that SHOULD make any human being with common sense say &quot;why lie about this if the truth is so easily explained.&quot;</p>

<p>I don&#39;t necessarily like the Jeranism guy on youtube, but he recently made a video about the Space X launch, and how SOMEHOW they were able to go back and edit the live feed video after it had been posted. You are unable to edit live streams without deleting and reuploading the video after it has been complete, and the video normally reflects this with the upload date.</p>

<p>SpaceX was somehow granted the ability to go back and edit their video of the live feed WITHOUT reuploading it, this is deceptive. Now the question is.. if everything they are doing is on the up and up.. why be deceptive at all? Doesn&#39;t that just open the door for scrutiny.</p>

<p>I have a feeling I won&#39;t get an intelligent answer from you, but I hope I do.. if they are willing to be so shady over something so insignificant as Jeranism points out in his video, the question should then be.. why?</p>

<p>This is where I think we differ however. I personally think it&#39;s wrong that &quot;top content creators&quot; like Space X or NASA are allowed to change things that are advertised as &quot;live.&quot; where if you or I try to edit a livestream we did last week, we can&#39;t. We have to delete the video, and reupload the corrected version. This is subversive and deceptive. Why not just reupload the correct version and say, &quot;this is the corrected version, we accidentally did x, y, and z wrong and this shows the corrected format.&quot;</p>

<p>Not doing this just comes off as deceptive. If you do not agree, then you must be easily fooled. And that is not an insult, that is just the kind of mindset that screams &quot;naive.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes!</p>

<p>Rob Skiba’s experiment regarding atmospheric magnification is just plain wrong; it’s not a matter of opinion. You treat his words as fact and got pissy when I insulted him and YouTube pseudoscientists like him.</p>

<p>It’s not about what I believe, it’s about what I can prove. And that is what makes actual science different from flat earth science.</p>

<p>For air to work as a lens in the way that he is saying it works as a lens (with the thickest part floating off of the ground), it would require a layer of low density air on the bottom, with higher density air on top of it, followed by more low density air on top of that. This doesn’t work in either a flat earth or round earth model. Higher density air is always at the bottom, with lower density air on top because of gravity. If you are one of the flat earthers who does not believe in gravity, then plug buoyancy in here instead. You can take a barometer and test this yourself if you don’t believe me.</p>

<p>We know how atmospheric magnification works. Rob Skiba partially explains it himself in the video you linked earlier. This is observable and repeatable if you look at any tall structure from a great enough distance.</p>

<p>We know how refraction of light works. This is observable and repeatable. You can mess around with prisms and lenses yourself to figure this out.</p>

<p>Rob Skiba and the like’s experiments are filled with half truths and false “facts”. I am aware that I am only ripping apart one of his experiments, but you can poke holes in all of them if you look hard enough. </p>

<p>Just because you are too lazy or too stubborn to go out and observe the empirical data, is no reason to take random YouTubers’ words as gospel.</p>

<p>Don’t take my word for it. Do some research and testing for yourself.</p>

<p>Maybe I chose my words poorly. Delusional is not the right choice. Rob Skiba is the delusional one because his experiments are flawed and when he is called out on it, he ignores it to push his false flat earth narrative. However, you <strong>are</strong> gullible for believing him.</p>

If I am wrong about something I&#39;m willing to admit it, doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m never going to look at it from another perspective or question it further, doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m going to just believe what some random on the internet says because he says it&#39;s truth. You have more issues than I do.. and as you said..</p>

<p>If you haven&#39;t come across these things while <em>genuinely</em> seeking truth (not saying you will find it, but the search is the important part IMO.) then you are blind, whether intentionally or not. It&#39;s 100% out there.</p>

<p>Also, just because a person is not a university-accredited &quot;scientist&quot; and uses Youtube as their outlet to share their content, does not deem them unable to perform scientific experimentation and critical thinking, nor does it validate those who want to dismiss them because they call them &quot;youtube armchair scientists&quot;</p>

<p>There&#39;s a reason most flat earth &quot;scientists&quot; use YouTube as their only outlet. For the most part, these individuals are incapable of performing competent scientific experimentation. Their experiments are usually flawed in one way or another and can easily be debunked. I&#39;ll admit choosing which &quot;facts&quot; to cherry pick from their sources does take an ounce of critical thinking, but I think that&#39;s as far as it goes for most.</p>
