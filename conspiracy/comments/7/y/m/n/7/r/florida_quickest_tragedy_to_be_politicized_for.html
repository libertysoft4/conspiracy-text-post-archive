A) Truly was a lone wolf shooter, but congress left loves that there&#39;s another shooting to keep trying with gun control. B) Same, but they&#39;ve also paid the students to keep pushing agenda. C) Same of real shooter, but the kids on TV are actors also paid by the anti gun / pro gun control people. D) another false flag </p>

I believe it must have to do with the military-industrial lobby and the crazybig gun-lobby.

<p>Guns represent three things: Sexuality, Power over others, and control. The United States is a very fucked up country on a variety of levels from the government on down. Many people feel the powerlessness of this. Guns are, potentially, the great equalizer. Guns are a part of American DNA (unfortunately). The United States had a civil war (over money, not slaves)...using guns. Also, the entertainment media, Hollywood, glorifies guns and violence. So does TV. Therefore American citizens are indoctrinated to like guns. That said, &quot;Gun control&quot; is <em>impossible</em>.</p>

<p>Women and gays both own guns, of course. The point is that most gun owners are straight males - with too much testosterone. That said, this is but a minor part of the equation. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>This may be the stupidest thing I&#39;ve heard today. It actually is very healthy to be scared of a thing that can kill you in a split of a second. It is nothing more than normal to be healthy of the reason why on a yearly basis over 13.000 people die in the USA. You are going to need a boatload of propaganda to teach kids that this is not a crazy high amount of gun deaths, but i wish you good luck.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No sir. You&#39;ve obviously never had proper training. You respect guns, you don&#39;t have a fear of them. Guns are OPERATED by humans. ANY and ALL things that gun can be used for is decided by the operator. Be scared of the operator, respect the gun. It&#39;s simple, any cop/solider can agree with this.</p>

<p>Most gun homicides are done by inner city gang violence. Most gun deaths (60%ish) are suicides. There are 13000ish deaths per year due to guns, and about  40000 injured. I gurantee at least 3/4 of these deaths are in areas that are gun free or in cities like Chicago with strict gun laws. What&#39;s is hard about understanding that there are 350+ million guns owned in the US, no matter what law you make, a person that wants a gun will get one. A person who wants to hurt someone will do it regardless of a gun or not. Your lack of understanding of the subject is...perplexing </p>

In the netherlands anyone that really, really tries, can get a gun, but it&#39;s not easy. We still only have less than 10 shootings yearly. Our perspective is just so different. Mine is: 13.000 people dieing because of guns is 13.000 too many. Yours is: &quot;but a lot of them don&#39;t count because they are gang related.&quot; Hell yeah they count. And the most nihilistic argument of them all is this one: &quot;we have 350 million guns, and you can&#39;t get them all, so we even bother trying to enforce gun control in the first place&quot;.

    <div class="md"><p>Regulated? Illegal is the word you&#39;re looking for. Matter of fact in almost every country in the world, they are illegal. And every country in the world has a lower gun violence rate, a lower gun violence/per capita rate, a lower gun homicide rate/a lower gun homicide per capita rate, than the USA. I know that correlation is not causation but you are literally behind Afghanistan in almost all statistics because of you gun laws. The only country you beat last year when it comes to gun violence was fucking Yemen. </p>

<p>So to answer your question. I cannot tell you if it is the (only) cause, but there is a linear extremely significant correlation between gun control and crime rates. (not just in the USA, but also in the few other countries that allow guns)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I will be honest with you, I completely forgot about this. Yes it is true, good catch. You can have a gun here for hunting purposes, and hunting purposes only. We really need this aswell, mostly in the south of the country, because we have a big overpopulation of certain animals that needs to be controlled in part by hunters. Note that our background checks are insanely good, and you can in no way use a gun as a means of self-defense or even carry it in public.  But it is true that we still have a lot of guns around here (estimated around 1/100 civilians in the most current estimations). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know this, that was what recent gallup polls showed out. a hefty majority in both! parties want reform, however 70% wants to keep 2nd amendment. And the second amendment is what it&#39;s all about after all. USA is only one of three countries that gives its civilians an inherent right to guns to protect themselves. To me that is unique.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most of the time they are always quick to capitalize on the tragedy to push this agenda. Vegas was an anomaly in that there wasn&#39;t much of a call for gun control afterwards...likely because of how sloppy it was. But the real culprit here isn&#39;t the gun, its the FBI who was warned about this man and his intentions yet failed to notify their own Miami field office so that they might investigate.</p>

<p>Guns may cause issues from time to time but they are nothing compared to the massive issue that would be caused if American gun ownership was curtailed. A Free Republic, whose ultimate power is derived from the consent of its citizens, necessarily requires that the citizens be armed to form the final check and balance, even if only in theory. </p>

<p>Some posters on this thread criticize this boards stance on guns and point out that even Progressives here are in favor of gun ownership...as a Progressive I say damn right I&#39;m in favor of gun ownership. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wait - I&#39;m confused though. What federal anti-gun legislation was actually enacted in the age of mass shootings (since Columbine)? I see some laws that were enacted at the state or local level - but those are relatively minor and localized. </p>

<p>If we are to really believe these events are mechanized propaganda machines meant to drive the agenda - where&#39;s the legislation in Congress to take the guns away? </p>

<p>OK - i literally did that and just see her proposed bills. The most recent one is moving the age limit to 21. </p>

<p>She proposed an Assualt Weapons Ban in November 2017 - which went nowhere. </p>

<p>Now, a couple days ago - she&#39;s proposing a new bill to move the legal age to purchase a gun to 21. </p>

<p>Is that what you wanted me to literally google? Nothing seems like she&#39;s &#39;taking our guns&#39; away. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t believe everything OP posted, but what you said is just flat out wrong. You asked for legislation that&#39;s being pushed I gave you an example... But after Columbine there were federal and state laws put in place that required safety locks on fire arms as well as banning the importation of high capacity mags.  After Sandy Hook, Obama literally said he would make gun control a central issue of his second term, created a gun violence task force and even signed 23 executive orders and proposed 12 congressional actions regarding gun control, I believe most of them were about universal background checks and and limiting of mags again..... I never said the govt &quot;is taking our guns away,&quot; youre just wrong about nothing being done or nothing being talked about after these events...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, I asked for &quot;what federal anti-gun legislation was actually enacted...&quot;. Please comprehend my question, before calling me wrong. </p>

<p>You provided me with a search query, I searched said query and literally found nothing that Sen. Feinstein proposed was enacted.   </p>

<p>And you&#39;re right, Obama did proposed a number of initiatives including &quot;His plan includes universal background checks for gun sales, the reinstatement and strengthening of the assault weapons ban, limiting ammunition magazines to a 10-round capacity, and other measures.&quot; However, where are those laws today? Still non-existent from my research as I believe Congress needs to take action. </p>

<p>People can talk a big game, but actions are louder. I still see no action. But continue to waste your energy and get all worked up about talk, that&#39;s exactly what <em>they</em> want.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Those aren&#39;t the only examples lol.... Obviously, it was literally just put together a couples days ago, not sure if you understand how quickly our govt operates, but she was talking about a full on new assult weapon ban earlier, before deciding on this age bill, I&#39;d just recommend you try to look into things before making irrational judgements, none of us have even stated our actual positions on this matter so don&#39;t assume you know my stance, remember &quot;do something&quot; isn&#39;t a legal argument, be specific if youre gonna go around preaching this shit.... Oh and btw, I don&#39;t like statute of limitations laws either.... If you don&#39;t think the law can withstand the test of time it shouldnt govern people to begin with....</p>

And what I am doing this morning is looking into things before making judgements. I have looked into what federal gun control laws are being pursued in the last 18 years, and can&#39;t seem to find any that fit this narrative.  </p>

<p>Again, all I&#39;m asking for is what the federal government has put in place as a result of these &quot;mass shootings&quot;. I can&#39;t seem to come across any legislation that was the supposed intended outcome of these events. </p>
