    <div class="md"><p>If you think having access to guns somehow helps you in not being totally reliant on the state and a sheep and a cog in the machine then you are sadly mistaken.</p>

<p>Obviously the average American is not less of a “letztemenschen&quot; than anyone else on this planet. However every/most other country doesn&#39;t have this free access to guns as the US does. So can you explain this? The logic dictates then that access to guns does not magically make the population more self-reliant. </p>

<p>Personally I think this access to guns is absolutely insane. There is no need for it and it absolutely will not help you or your militia make any kind of dent in the government military.  All it does is allow people to kill other people very efficiently in the heat of the moment or psychotically with planning, whereas in other countries most of these would-be killings end up as simple fights or something less violent and less lethal. 
People are generally pretty stupid, witness the amount of toddlers accidentally shooting their parents. <em>You</em> yourself may know how to handle weapons in a safe way but most people don&#39;t and also you are yourself susceptible to use your weapons in a revenge or rage type attack.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve taken LSD over half a dozen times now, and I&#39;ve lost count of the number of times I&#39;ve used mushrooms.

<p>That doesn&#39;t mean it isn&#39;t fascist propaganda.  If it was, say, Julius Evola&#39;s writing, someone else would have used the f-word before I did; but for some inexplicable reason, Nietzsche gets a free pass.  I suspect it&#39;s because Nietzsche advocates people dominating each other regardless of political context.  Evola was more specific.</p>

<p>In practice, yes; but one of the ways it seduces people is by offering theoretical independence.  The survival of corporatism also depends on the Will to Power; the idea that if you get high enough up in the corporate hierarchy, you too can go from being one of the abused, to one of the abusers.</p>

<p>Most supposedly non-fascist conservatives talk a good game about independence; but all you need to do in response to that, is ask them how they feel about the police and military, which are two groups who they almost unfailingly express outright worship towards.  Find me a single, self-identifying adherent of the Right, who doesn&#39;t view the police as public saviours; and the reason why that matters, is because in practice, individual liberty can not exist in a scenario where the state has both an outward facing and an inward facing army.</p>

<p>It offers a lie. How so?</p>

<p>Any totalitarian state likes to redefine Freedom as freedom from fear/risk. This is not true freedom, but security posing as freedom. State then sets itself up in the role of &quot;protector&quot; as the individual becomes &quot;the protected&quot; (a form of surrender).</p>

<p>Real Freedom is freedom to do or to be. Another word for this is Liberty. The concept of liberty fits in pretty well with Nietzsche&#39;s ideas about independence, personal transformation and spiritual evolution.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Yes they do. But if you look at what they do vs what they say, you usually notice how they go after personal liberties instead. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know anyone on Reddit who mentions the word freedom in association with anything they want, in any context.  The political consensus of this web site is authoritarian Communist.  The word &quot;socialist&quot; is preferred, but that is only really because they know that Communism as a term still has the potential to alienate some.</p>

<p>Millennials as a generation, in my experience are completely incapable of recognising unregulated, unmediated, or unsupervised scenarios of any kind, as having any positive worth or value whatsoever.  They want their hand held in literally every aspect of their lives.  They can&#39;t imagine making opinions or thinking for themselves without input from some kind of pre-approved, third-party &quot;expert,&quot; and they don&#39;t believe that any form of activity should ever be taken without the approval of one of said experts, or some other kind of authority figure.</p>

<p>So no.  Freedom doesn&#39;t need to be redefined, in the current context.  We&#39;ve gone way past that.  Millennials want nothing to do with freedom; they don&#39;t even want to use that word as a euphemism for dependency.  They want their entire life on rails, and they want to be sure that no one can ever say anything which might hurt their feelings.  The single main thing that has caused the level of despair which I experience on a daily basis, is the degree of constant hatred for liberty which I see Millennials on this site express.  I have never seen or heard of another generation in our species&#39; history, which more passionately or adamantly loves its&#39; cage.</p>
