    <div class="md"><p>The sky isn&#39;t falling. It never will. That&#39;s part of the fear campaign. We lost our sub to a lot of BS and many old users see and feel it. I finally realized it had come to a new low with that godforsaken Fox News article about those 13 indictments. Which btw. Fucking 13. How non occult like at all. Oh my lord. They know they got you if they still have you. </p>

<p>Trump is quite literally our AntiChrist. Not that I&#39;m religious. Just my wording. But he&#39;s definitely representing something nefarious. The final installment of the NWO. While the sub deteriorates to partisan politics and intense senseless arguments. </p>

If they don&#39;t like something they call all of their friends and attack it. Kinda the new mentality of the upcomming generations. They&#39;re all trying to change stuff they don&#39;t like instead of just avoiding it. Sometimes that&#39;s good, other times it&#39;s boarderline harrasment, but I won&#39;t stoop to their level.</p>

<p>Should start with <a href="http://biblehub.com/kjv/ezekiel/1.htm">Ezekiel 1.</a> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>9Their wings were joined one to another; they turned not when they went; they went every one straight forward. </p>

<p>11Thus were their faces: and their wings were stretched upward; two wings of every one were joined one to another, and two covered their bodies. 12And they went every one straight forward: whither the spirit was to go, they went; and they turned not when they went. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you. I&#39;m very interested in the Old Testament. I&#39;m starting to think we had a very advanced civilization before the massive flood 14,000 years ago or w/e. </p>

<p>I grew up in catholic school which pushed me far from organized religion, but the more I learn about pre-history as well as the Roman Empire, the more I want to learn the truths in the Bible. I forget who posted it, but it was a random comment in this sub talking about the Roman Empire never fell. Started taking me down a hell of a rabbit hole.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I dunno about everyone else, but I&#39;m here to stay and I would miss the genuine users here immensely. So many great discussions and ideas were shared on this sub. Its a shame that powerful people decided that we shouldn&#39;t be allowed to discuss certain ideas (I think Pizzagate and Seth Rich primarily triggered this), and so they decided to unleash a shill infestation on this sub.</p>

<p>And I don&#39;t want those groups to win, so I will always come back here. We have no idea if/when their funding will run out, but you never know, it could happen somewhat soon. I&#39;ll be watching.</p>

<p>As for other forums, none are exactly the same as this one but there are some decent alternatives. I can PM you if you&#39;d like but I&#39;ll bet you know of them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sandy hook and pizzagate were never started by trump or fox. Pizzagate was started from podesta&#39;s emails released by WikiLeaks, and sandy hook was started after researchers exposed anomalies with the shooting in 2012. while seth rich got started after Assange did that interview where he hinted that seth rich was his leaker. I don&#39;t see how a theory can be cuckoo if it was basically started by hints from Wikileaks (an agency that has exposed so much corruption) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>WikiLeaks proved itself to be a corrupt partisan org only concerned with making Hillary look bad. They lost a ton of credibility with that and then kept it going with those aforementioned insane theories. That&#39;s what started this divide. This sub and this way of thinking is supposed to be the opposite of trusting one sole person/organization, but unfortunately a lot of people fell into automatically trusting Assange/wikileaks&#39; word (and for many trumps word). That&#39;s the antithesis of this whole thing. He sucked you in and then once he had a specific personal agenda, you were willing to believe it as truth automatically. Bad critical thinker.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Haha amen.</p>

<p>Antarctica is super interesting to me. It ties back to the pre-flood stuff. I&#39;m starting to rabbit hole down.</p>

<p>To me it seems possible advanced ancient civilizations (14,000+ years ago) lived in Antarctica because it was highly habitable. Then the ice age hit, caused the flood and whipped out nearly every civilization on earth at the time.</p>

<p>If that would happen today, the only signs that humans existed 10,000+ years from now would be the great pyramids and mt Rushmore. Everything else would be gone. Who&#39;s to say that hasn&#39;t happened once or twice before? Who&#39;s to say we&#39;re the most advanced humans to walk on this earth?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Belief doesn&#39;t do it justice, is faith a better term for your proof less views? How does it feel to let your political views be founded on hunches or &quot;likelihood and probability&quot; that anyone literate with half a brain has been laughing at since the 15th century? You know that there are countless conspiracy theories that do have proof? There are so many good reasons to hate Hillary, believing something like pizzagate or one of many documented Russian troll accounts just makes you arrive at an otherwise justifiable conclusion via getting cucked by soviet propaganda techniques we, once again, have proof of and have known about for years. I legitimately pity you. What will your cucked ass get tricked into next? Let me know because I&#39;d love to laugh in your face. I know the world to be much much worse than news that requires proof  let&#39;s on, but I also accept that if a conspiracy theory exists that lacks proof or reason that it is not only useless, but politically disempowering to subscribe to. There are countless effective ways to change the world, most of them require a shitton of money, but literally making up theories about a child sexual abuse ring is one that in the end, gets you extremely cucked. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Russia is a conspiracy with no evidence at all and the 17 indictments are jokes.  </p>

<p>However, Seth Rich was murdered by Hillary Clinton personally with a knife to his heart while she sucked out his soul. I know this because Sean Hannity has promised me evidence of it.  Ignore that it was never released and his own investigator says Fox lied.  Also, I know this is true because Julian Assange has implied it is true. Surely Wikileaks, which we all know has denied involvement with Trump is credible and unbiased. Please ignore them asking for political favors from the Trumps and apparently being in common communication secretly with Sean Hannity.  </p>

<p>These shootings are fake as fuck false flags by the way. I know because Alex Jones, the man who called his show an act under oath, tells me.  </p>

<p>Also, and I want to be very clear about this. HRC is the queen pizza pedo. This is a matter very near and dear to my heart sir. Please do not mention that the prosecutor who game Jeffrey Epstein the plea deal that this sub thinks is dirty, is Trump&#39;s buddy. (this guy, <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/politics/ct-jeffrey-epstien-alexander-acosta-sex-abuse-case-20170321-story.html">http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/politics/ct-jeffrey-epstien-alexander-acosta-sex-abuse-case-20170321-story.html</a>).  I&#39;m only here to examine people I don&#39;t like good sir.  </p>

<p>Podesta is evil by the way I feel it in my bones and he worked with Hilary as a campaign manager! Who could let this go? What, Paul Manafort has been a criminal conspirator working with Russia to influence foreign elections and commit crimes in countries like Ukraine and we have proof of the secret payments? And he offered a Russian Oligarch private briefings on the Trump campaign? Nothingburger you fools.  </p>

<p>Lets talk instead about the biased Mueller investigation that hates conservatives. Started by life long Republican Comey, replace and now run by Republic Wray, with their toadie liberal bosses in the DOJ Jeff Sessions and Rosentstein also republicans, who had the gaul to hire Mueller that other republican schill! BIASED I TELL YOU! How can we trust these hit jobbers?  </p>

<p>Remember that time the FBI had a secret society for a day before the Senator pretending the claim walked back on it? That was a good day. I was vindicated then.  </p>

Too many changes in terms of censorship hit all at once during the political season. I suspect special VIP tools or consulting sessions were provided to political campaigns and key reputation management firms leading into 2016, and the full scope of what she did became realized after Pao&#39;s outing and Spez stepped back in (co-opting her platform but maybe not being quite so aggressive about expansion).</p>
