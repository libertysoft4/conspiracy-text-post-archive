<p>Why can&#39;t you accept one person might just wanna kill some people with no agenda, but can accept that a group of people in the goverment/CIA/FBI/whoever will happily kill a bunch of people for some &quot;hidden agenda&quot;?</p>

<p>It is explicitly legal for the US to propagandize their own citizens with fake news.   We&#39;ve seen it again and again, so it&#39;s only natural that the default is not to buy in to extraordinary and sensational claims based only on faith in authority.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly, just to myself, like a madman on a street corner haha. </p>

<p>I understand that, but they&#39;re also basing their lack of trust only on a faith that <strong>everything</strong> isn&#39;t as it seems, whether that&#39;s the case or not. </p>

<p>And i can understand why it might be easier to accept &quot;the authority is lying to you&quot; than &quot;a human is capable of random slaughter&quot;, but sometimes it is just that.</p>

<p>I guess I just feel sorry for any family or loved one of those who were killed; it can&#39;t be fun for them to be told their child, sibling, whatever, didn&#39;t really die, or they got killed to push the gun agenda, etc. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because I can look up the names of the 17 people who died, and I&#39;m sure I could find them on social media sites, or (if I wanted to be really insensitive) ask their friends about them, what happened, how they died. 
Why do you believe they didn&#39;t? (I&#39;m not asking this as an arsey comment back at you, I&#39;m genuinely interested)</p>

<p>I wasn&#39;t speaking in a direct term, I&#39;m not saying people are going up to them and telling them so, but clearly it&#39;s not hard to find people on the internet who believe that to be the case. 
&quot;How dare you insinuate it?&quot;

    <div class="md"><p>I was talking about false flags, not hoaxes. </p>

<p>&quot;They&quot; (MSM I assume you mean?) would, I&#39;m sure, push for water-guns-filled-with-acid control control if he&#39;d squirted them all in the face with acid. I think it only feels that way, however, because they&#39;re just trying to stop this from happening again, and most people don&#39;t want a full on gun ban, just tighter restrictions.</p>

<p>A van or truck runs people in a pedestrian area; you don&#39;t call for the removal of vans, but you put up concrete barriers or ways to stop it from happening again. </p>

<p>Besides, would you rather &quot;they&quot; just say &quot;oh well, shit happens&quot; and not try change anything, so that the next time it happens they can be blamed for not doing anything to prevent it?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually they are pushing for self-driving cars too. </p>

<p>Whether or not all these incidents are false flags...I am not even really concerned about.</p>

<p>Yes I believe the Florida shooting happened. I do not have enough evidencd at this point to determine if it was a false flag, but even if it was not:</p>

<p>1) We now live in a society where these shootings are happening consistently. There is something really wrong, and we need to look at why our society is so sick. I might write a post on this.</p>

<p>2) They are pushing certain agendas and narratives. If you can, look at the top of <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> right now. They are definitely pushing the anti gun narrative.</p>

<p>3) To me, it is not about guns. It is a sick society - yeah, but we do not hear about that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>To be honest I have been thinking about smoking lately.</p>

<p>Why the push towards no smoking but not no drinking? I think drinking is way more harmful.</p>

<p>Smoking can be done in moderation like drinking can.</p>

<p>I smoke the ocassional cigarette. Just offering a counter-argument. Playing devil&#39;s advocate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>God, don&#39;t get me started on that. I 100% agree. Sadly, at least in the UK, there would be way too much push back from it. </p>

<p>My assumption, and to be fair I&#39;m also assuming this is why smoking isn&#39;t banned, is the amount of tax earned from them being legal.</p>
