<p>That influx from TD and r/politics was organic. TD came here because they witnessed dozens of conspiracies come true during the campaign, and r/politics because of the share blue takeover brigade basically follows and argues with TD folks where ever they go.</p>

<p>I saw the whole thing happen. I was daily in all 3 subs, stil unsure what to make of everything, and watched weekly more conspiracies come true in 4chan/TD, and so on, and people in TD referencing that r/conspiracy has been talking about &quot;said topic&quot; for years or months. This started the influx.</p>

<p>r/politics never took r/conspiracy serious. We were always seen as tinfoil nutters and laughed at. Whenever I got into any debates there, they would look at my history with r/conspiracy being my main sub I post to/hang out, at that time, and make a tinfoil remark, they would laugh, and then would just shrug and move on.</p>

<p>The influx of people from r/politics into r/conspiracy has been a recent event, just the last 4-6 months.  </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Majority folks there still see us as nutters</p>

<p>That&#39;s fine. He has a right to do that. He chose that side of the spectrum, and felt strong enough about to do that. As long as r/conspiracy stays, to the best of its ability, open and inclusive, there is nothing wrong with that. I am also an ex-democrat who started to lean right, a combo of some aspects of conservatism (spirituality, morals, values, financially) with libertarian views, ultimately an independent centrist, and I have various subs/interests outside of this sub, as is my right</p>

<p>r/politics looked like it got taken over, there was a mod purge, all new mods took over, and all of a sudden everything on the right was banned/downvoted, and everything on the left was blown up. It looked like an actual takeover, and there are people/whistleblowers supposedly claiming it got taken over for $, by shareblue. I was there and the sub certainly looked like it did go through that. In terms of $, that would require some sort of federal investigation to see if its 100% legit.</p>

<p>Perhaps a takeover was happening here too. However, when Flytape was here, before the TD influx, he was a good, but human, mod</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t really disagree with anything you said up until that last paragraph. You make some good points, especially about some of the users in <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>. But as far as I&#39;m aware, the only &quot;evidence&quot; of the moderators there being bought out was from a single anonymous 4chan post that didn&#39;t actually provide any sources. I could claim the same thing about the mods here and it would be just as believable. I used to comment in politics pretty often myself because there were occasionally some interesting debates and other times where I just couldn&#39;t keep my opinions to myself. And while the users there could be pretty awful, the moderators always seemed decent to me. I never had a single comment of mine removed, even though I went against the grain quite often. And the one time I got death threats (for saying I voted third party of all things) they were quick to ban the offending users and remove their comments.  </p>

<p>I&#39;ve only been in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> for about 2-3 years, so I can&#39;t speak for what things were like before then. But the whole mess with DronePuppet using numerous alt accounts to undermine this subreddit and ban left-leaning users, Flytape sticking up for him (and maybe helping him), and then the two of them running off together and starting a new right-wing only conspiracy subreddit makes me question any of their actions before that. They didn&#39;t just suddenly decide to become super biased one day.</p>

<p>. But as far as I&#39;m aware, the only &quot;evidence&quot; of the moderators there being bought out was from a single anonymous 4chan post that didn&#39;t actually provide any sources. </p>

<p>Yes that&#39;s the one. Like I said, we don&#39;t have a smoking gun for it unless there was a federal investigation. However, here at r/conspiracy, we usually consider these things as a possibility, and more often then not, they end up being true later on</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I never had a single comment of mine removed, even though I went against the grain quite often. And the one time I got death threats (for saying I voted third party of all things) they were quick to ban the offending users and remove their comments.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I mean it make sense. The best thing to do is Mod fairly there, while making sure the headlines leaning left are plastered on r/all front page and that the main headlines/sources are controlled to create that narrative. Once you do that, then policing individual comments in a massive seas of thousands of comments, can be given to those on the lower end of the totem</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;ve only been in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> for about 2-3 years, so I can&#39;t speak for what things were like before then. But the whole mess with DronePuppet using numerous alt accounts to undermine this subreddit and ban left-leaning users, Flytape sticking up for him (and maybe helping him), and then the two of them running off together and starting a new right-wing only conspiracy subreddit makes me question any of their actions before that.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I mean flytape, if he didn&#39;t know what was up, and was sticking up for him, makes sense if he never did anything before then that was wrong. But if he knew and was helping or not, that&#39;s still to be seen. Perhaps at that time, there was a left brigading squad coming in and trying to take over the comments after they saw TD folks starting to come here, and it was a fight behind the scenes, or however it went down, like I said, if flytape did something wrong and there&#39;s legit proof then I&#39;m good with it. I just remember him being a good mod, very hands off, during a time when the sub was really wide open and free</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s definitely a big deal. They wouldn&#39;t be shilling if it had no effect on us, so we should all try to be aware of the shilling. However, it&#39;s misleading to imply that Russia is only pretending to be Trump supporters. It seems a lot of users on Reddit have the false belief that they aren&#39;t being influenced because they are on the other side. </p>

<p>There is more focus and discussions online about &quot;Russian-linked&quot; conservatives, but there are &quot;Russian-linked&quot; accounts on both sides. The theory is that Russia is trying to divide the country by pretending to be both sides. You have to be careful because Russia might be able to manipulate you by pretending to be a person who appears to have similar political beliefs to your own. Make sure you are the one who drew your conclusions. Don&#39;t let others online push you into an extreme position. You could be doing their work for them.</p>

<p>Sixteen thousand Facebook users said that they planned to attend a Trump protest on Nov. 12, 2016, organized by the Facebook page for BlackMattersUS, a Russian-linked group that sought to capitalize on racial tensions between black and white Americans. The event was shared with 61,000 users.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>“In effect, the effort aims to spend a large sum of money to increase the amount of trolling that already exists online. </p>

<p>The plan comes as Clinton operatives grapple with the reality that her supporters just aren’t as engaged and aggressive online as are her detractors inside and outside the Democratic Party.</p>

<p>The lack of engagement is one of Clinton’s bigger tactical vulnerabilities, particularly when compared with rivals like Donald Trump, whose viral social media attacks are legion, and Sen. Bernie Sanders, who is backed by a passionate army of media-savvy millennials.</p>

<p>Some experts on digital campaigns think the idea of launching a paid army of “former reporters, bloggers, public affairs specialists, designers” and others to produce online counterattacks is unlikely to prove successful. Others, however, say Clinton has little choice but to try, given the ubiquity of online assaults and the difficulty of squelching even provably untrue narratives once they have taken hold.</p>

<p>At the same time, however, using a super PAC to create a counterweight to movements that have sprung up organically is another reflection of the campaign’s awkwardness with engaging online, digital pros said.</p>

<p>“It is meant to appear to be coming organically from people and their social media networks in a groundswell of activism, when in fact it is highly paid and highly tactical,” said Brian Donahue, chief executive of the consulting firm Craft Media/Digital.</p>

<p>“That is what the Clinton campaign has always been about,&quot; he said. &quot;It runs the risk of being exactly what their opponents accuse them of being: a campaign that appears to be populist but is a smokescreen that is paid and brought to you by lifetime political operatives and high-level consultants.”</p>

Correct the Record and ShareBlue practiced/practice <em>direct engagement</em>, meaning they were/are literally deep in the comments of Reddit, Twitter, and Facebook doing battle with networks of fake accounts and vote manipulation bots. They get constant updates of talking points and they push these in a coordinated manner all day every day. Yes, they post articles, too. But that is only a small part of their strategy,  </p>

<p>I&#39;m willing to have an honest discussion about some Russian interference on social media, really, I can admit that this is a very plausible thing for private or public Russian interests to try to do.   </p>

<p>You however, don&#39;t appear to me to be interested in an honest discussion. Articles. Give me a fucking break. I am not misunderstanding that CTR press release. David Brock and Hilary Clinton literally admitted (excitedly) to the whole plan in their cryptographically verified leaked e-mails. What Media Matters has been doing goes way beyond spreading links and amounts to psychological warfare. You must think we&#39;re really stupid and we&#39;re just going to ignore what we watched happen in <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> after the DNCC and in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> after the inauguration. You really think I&#39;m going to forget how <strong>hundreds</strong> of ridiculously bland anti-Trump subreddits came up over night pumping out the same bland anti-Trump content all day every day where all the comments sound like they were written by the same team of grandmas all trying desperately to sound like the &quot;young people&quot; without breaking character?  </p>

<p>If we are going to open this door, then we are going to investigate <strong>ALL</strong> information warfare operations which occurred on the internet during the 2016 election and since. David Brock and his teams of shills should not be immune from this. These Russians were charged with things like fraud, by the way, not spreading misinformation. So either the fact that they were spreading misinformation is irrelevant or it&#39;s the whole point of the prosecution. If that&#39;s the point of the indictment, then David Brock and <em>every last one</em> of his paid shills should be investigated just as thoroughly and indicted if they are found to have committed any crimes, procedural or otherwise. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is fake news everywhere. There is fake news on /politics/ and T_D and there is fake news here. Remember the fake news about the Florida school shooter being part of a white supremacist group? That was retweeted 35,000 times on one tweet alone. The AP, ABC, ADL, all ran with it. I&#39;m sure you have unwittingly retweeted or shared fake news as well... are you a &quot;bootlicker&quot; now too?</p>

<p>Let&#39;s not pretend that fake news had a net benefit for Trump. He has been on the receiving end of most of it, and the mainstream media with their undeserved reputation for honesty are taken much more seriously than a twitter account.</p>

<p>I shouldn&#39;t even need to remind you of all of this. You know the MSM has been caught hundreds of times spreading anti-Trump bullshit. You dismiss that part, maybe because you enjoy it until it&#39;s retracted.</p>

<p>Because that&#39;s not the purpose of the indictment. It also didn&#39;t mention if Trump is having KFC for dinner tonight, but that doesn&#39;t mean he&#39;s not.</p>

<p>But that&#39;s not what happened. This propaganda was introduced to millions of Americans and was specifically targeted to swing states. There are still people out there that believe this stuff.

<blockquote>
<p>American intelligence officials have said they have no way of calculating the effect of the Russian influence.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s very vague though... I&#39;m just being honest. It seems to be referring to past statements by unknown officials at unknown agencies. I mean, did the NYT reporters just ask these officials after the indictments were announced? Or is this just what has been said in the past?</p>

<p>And if all of these intelligence officials can&#39;t be sure one way or another... that doesn&#39;t say a lot either.</p>

<p>leading undecided Aunt Betty-Sue to see a meme</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is the larger problem. The American education system is a failure at teaching people to use or practise common sense. To be honest, it&#39;s not just the American system, I&#39;m sure that Russian propaganda could influence other elections when they try and they do seem to have some links to Brexit but as a whole, it&#39;s more focused in America, especially in those poorer Republican states.</p>

<p>Russian propaganda was able to influence this election because the amount of dolts like Aunt Betty-Sue are everywhere. Or you see it on this sub with the types that think they&#39;re smart because they can counter every point with some tangential point about other so-called &#39;fake news&#39; not benefiting Trump because they can&#39;t seem to make logical connections. I think that whole curriculum needs some sort of review, get those kids to read more and take some sort of class that teaches basic logic or common sense or judgement.</p>

<p>No, my point is <em>someone started that</em> and at this point why would we not believe the impetus for <em>the meme war</em> were non-Americans? </p>

<p>I don&#39;t disagree with your statement but I think it&#39;s important our fellow countrymen realize the stakes of the game being played and make sure we are <em>aware of the endgame and consequences</em> for how we play it. </p>

<p>Why you ask? because save of few instances of incontrovertibly, everything you&#39;ve claimed is just a counter-conspiracy. how about the the official narrative of 9/11 be a conspiracy theory? Absolutely it is, a government sponsored conspiracy. what about the Russian Collusion plot? Well, it does say it in the name, only nicer and less loaded with flat-earthers. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>noun: collusion </p>

<p>secret or illegal cooperation or conspiracy, especially in order to cheat or deceive others.</p>

<p>synonyms:  <em>conspiracy</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, does the fact I believe the Russialago &quot;collusion&quot; narrative make me its pawn? Or is it only if you&#39;re pushing for it? either way, you would definitely meet your own definition of pawn i&#39;m afraid. </p>

<p>Man, you nailed your last sentence though. That one is essentially true.</p>

<p>Bad or embarrassing trump news? Front page slammed with pizza gate, seth rich, uranium one or begahzi. Like clockwork. And people here would get all riled up. </p>

<p>And I ask you, if you are getting riled up at the behest of a government intelligence agency, particularly an autocratic one like Russia run by kgb coloniel and with no respect for truth irvfree speach, should you not reflect on what you have done or been involved in?</p>

<p>All that hand wringing about CTR and derision about Russian trolls and penetration of this sub and yet it turns out the reverse is true, CTR played a minor role if any (I don’t know if incompetence or it was actually doing something else) and meanwhile Russia was spamming sites like redditvand creating fake narratives.</p>

<p>People should ask what we’re the motives, what was the truth and what was propaganda. Instead people are defensive and dropping whataboutisns and claiming fake news.</p>

<p>Thus sub really needs to rediscover critical thinking and self awareness.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I remember early reports of them 5 or so years back. They were less clandestine then. Actually was a good well sourced article in atlantic several years back where they interview some of the people that were involved. Then as evidence petered in before it got big it was apparent that something was going on. Then during the election reporters went to places like macedonia that were actively generating many of the articles. Some where just doing it entrepreneurially to get add revenue on social media platform but it seems like some were getting paid money from Russia. They had tried left wing fake news but didn&#39;t get as much traction but also definitely there was a move to push the Trump narrative because it was more divisive and more in Russia&#39;s interest. </p>

<p>This is separate from all the shady money dealings the people around Trump had with Russian oligarch money. </p>

<p>Trump was clearly bailed out from insolvency with deutche bank funneling Russia money. Don Jr admit they do a lot of business with Russian entities. </p>

<p>Kushner/ Flynn meanwhile was advocating the Russia-Saudi nuclear deal that required US lifting Russia sanctions. His 666 property is underwater and I wonder if he was promised a cut of the deal if the sanctions were lifted. I think that is why he wanted a private channel to Russia that kislyak nixed. Its why Flynn was talking to the Russians about sanctions the day obama kicked out the diplomats. It also probably why erik prince (betsty davos brother and blackwater founder) met the russians in the seychelles to set up a back door.  Him, flynn and oliver north were at the time trying to pitch a mercenary blackwater type security force. </p>

<p>Kushner later met the VEB bank head, a state owned back run by a kgb trained economist that is thought to funnel putin money and was caught running russian spies in the US. Kushner said it was state business, VEB said it was personal... except they are under sanctions, Kushner can&#39;t do business with them. VEB&#39;s head  speaks arabic and has heavily invested in the gulf since the sanctions... I think this was about the nuclear deal. </p>

<p>Manafort meanwhile was clearly operating under the oligarchs control, offering private briefings, changing the republican convention platform to exclude ukraine, etc. </p>

<p>Flynn was trying to make money at every turn too, from dealings with Erdawan about kidnapping gullen to the nuclear deal to oliver north/ erik prince mercenary army (oliver north of iran contra fame).</p>

<p>Gates was working with manafort. Papadopolous was a moron who got over his head and got honeypotted. Don Jr and Erik Trump are morons who were trying to win at an cost, but also along with kushner take a lot of sketchy money from Chinese, Russian, Turkish investors. </p>

<p>Cambridge analytica, wittingly or unwittingly maye have sold targetting data to Russian trolls. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think the Trump campaign is a Russian cell, Trump is scared of Russia dumping his sketchy transactions and money operations into the public space so avoids confronting Putin. Putin sees Trump as divisive domestically and incompetent in foreign policy and friendly to  Russia so his trolls backed up Trump. Then they used the levers of greed and ambition to compromise  individuals in the trump campaign... easy to do because legitimate political operatives want nothing to do with the Trump campaign or administration.</p>

<p>Basically, Russia played the game like a master... I think people should pause and think about how they were duped and what role they played. I don&#39;t know that this is exactly what happened but evidence suggests something like this went down. </p>

<p>Well, her email servers don&#39;t suggest &quot;blatant corruption,&quot; at absolute worst, they suggest &quot;gross negligence.&quot; But even that is such a ridiculous stretch.</p>

<p>Nothing that came out of the DNC emails implicates Clinton at all. The worst thing that came out of it is that it appears the the DNC really wanted Clinton to win, and were biased against Sanders. This is absolutely wrong, and Brazille deserved to be fired, but there is nothing in it that links Clinton to any of it.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t know if it is bots that convinced people of this, but you are certainly a victim of a misinformation campaign and you are far from alone if you believe the her email servers and the DNC email leaks even <em>suggest</em> corruption by Clinton, let alone even remotely prove it. I don&#39;t like Clinton, as i think she would have just been &quot;more of the same&quot; neo-liberalism, war-hawking that we have seen over the past 30 years, I would have much preferred Sanders. But, dear god, to buy into that BS just shows how effective disinformation campaigns can be. Whether it was Russians, bots or just other people who were able to fool you like this, that doesn&#39;t change the fact that you are among those who have been fooled.</p>

<p>Your argument to this point has been &quot;I don&#39;t like the way she looks.&quot; This doesn&#39;t prove she is a bad person, only that you would vote based on looks.</p>

<p>Except you don&#39;t make this case at all. All you did was trot out (or really, defend) the same old tired and ridiculous &quot;what about her emails and the DNC leaked emails?&quot; Oh yeah, and &quot;I don&#39;t like the way she looks.&quot; Great rational argument there. None of this shows anything about her being &quot;corrupt&quot; or &quot;terrible.&quot; Maybe incompetent, that is a more reasonable conclusion. But, holy hell, Trump proved himself 10x less competent than she throughout the election, so that would be a pretty bad reason to vote for Trump instead.</p>

That is the exact purpose of that medium, to convey information. Instead of taking this issue the direction it needs to go, which is by acknowledging that social media is something that you should not take seriously or spend much time on, let alone use to form a political opinion, it is going in a direction of censorship and control of the information and narrative, which is never good. </p>

<p>If you really believe 13 Russians or even 30,000 Russians using the internet influenced the election, you are living in la la land. The DNC didnt influence the election? Her emails didnt?

<p>Except this isn&#39;t true. You are just buying into the misinformation campaign. I don&#39;t know if it was the bots who fooled you, but they were pushing this ridiculous line of thinking, and you are parroting it.</p>

<p>You are confused. The intent of throwing out the &quot;whataboutism&quot; is to distract from the matter at hand. It is literally trying to take away from the validity of what is being discussed by pointing to something else.</p>

<p>I would be happy to, but I can&#39;t discredit something that you haven&#39;t (or, really, can&#39;t) actually provided. You&#39;ve made the claim that you read something with your own eyes that proves her blatant corruption. You&#39;ve made an assertion, it is time for you to support your case. Asking me to disprove the case you haven&#39;t even made yet is nonsense. Almost as dumb as pointing to number of upvotes and downvotes as if it proves who is right and who is wrong.</p>

Trump is the only republican official that doesn&#39;t believe he&#39;s obstructing justice, because he doesn&#39;t know what that is. He&#39;s <em>beyond</em> stupid.</p>

<p>And what policy of Trumps do you think caused this? Because it&#39;s pretty common sense that it takes quite some time for the benefits (or lack thereof) of the previous administration to wear off, and trump hasn&#39;t actually been able to do much. Obama did some great things with the economy, I&#39;ll agree with you there.</p>

<p>Not at all, the results have been appearing for years. What is very interesting is when out of nowhere in the space of about a week republicans went from &quot;The economy is awful&quot; to &quot;the economy is great&quot; despite the economy not actually changing in that week. Trump hasn&#39;t been able to make significant policy (up until the tax reform) and so the economy has continued to grow then same as it was during the second of of obama&#39;s presidency.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can say that personally, I went through something similar. It&#39;s not an outlier it&#39;s something I have heard more and more. I followed the election more than I&#39;ve followed any previous election this being the 3rd time I could vote. I was personally hoping for Sanders v Trump simply because I hated the idea of Clinton v Bush. After the primaries, I was disappointed Clinton won and had quickly lost any sort of faith in Trump based on his demeanor and actions. Over time though I grew to hate Clinton more and more and eventually looked more and more at Gary Johnson. While I knew he wouldn&#39;t win and I knew a lot of his ideas did not fit my own I appreciated someone who genuinely gave a shit about the people.</p>

<p>I still remember the days and weeks of T_D on the front page bashing Clinton and I would be lying to myself if it did not have an effect on me. Sure SanderforPres was on the front page a lot during the primaries but that quickly died down and T_D was absurdly more viral on Reddit. For a time the top 30 posts on <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> were from T_D typically all bashing Clinton. </p>

<p>It didn&#39;t happen overnight but given my feelings on Clinton were already lukewarm it certainly had a factor in swaying my vote without a doubt.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, you already disliked Clinton during the primaries, and you grew to dislike her more over the course of the election. You didn&#39;t want a continuation of the Bush / Clinton dynasties, and a lot of people felt the same way. It was a kind of &quot;hope and change&quot; moment... right? Just like how Obama won. You didn&#39;t want the same old shit.</p>

<p>All of that seems natural to me. It doesn&#39;t sound like your feelings about Clinton were as lukewarm as you say though. Just a few sentences earlier you said you hated the idea of Clinton vs Bush.</p>

<p>Then when it came down to it, you didn&#39;t want either Clinton or Trump. But those were the only two realistic choices you were given - anything else was a throwaway vote. That&#39;s not your problem... that&#39;s just how it turned out this time around. It happens.</p>

<p>Where did the Russian interference really come in to play for you? If anything, seeing posts from T_D seems to have reinforced your existing beliefs and opinions. Preaching to the choir, as the saying goes.</p>

<p>And I think a lot of people are sort of pretending that Reddit is more influential than it really is. I&#39;d love to see some polls or surveys from Trump supporters in &quot;battleground states&quot; to see how many of them have even heard of Reddit, let alone heard of T_D sub.</p>

<p>I never visited that sub during the election, and only checked it out once very briefly after the election when there was a crosspost from here in conspiracy. The rules they had (or maybe still have) about not criticizing Trump just seemed odd to me. At least they&#39;re being up front about it I guess. Not like /politics/ where the unwritten rule is that you can&#39;t say anything nice about Trump at all. I see both /politics/ and T_D as two sides of the same coin.</p>

<p>A closer look at the #TEN_GOP controversy: Only 23 of the posts were made BEFORE the election. Only 5 of these made it to front-page of The_Donald, meaning they comprised 00.015% of front-page posts on the sub.</p>

<p>Link to that update post with more info: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7ybkyt/a_closer_look_at_the_ten_gop_controversy_only_23/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7ybkyt/a_closer_look_at_the_ten_gop_controversy_only_23/</a></p>

<p>5 posts linking to that Twitter account made it to the front page of T_D before the election. That&#39;s not even the front page of /all/ but they may have made it that far as well. Even so, that&#39;s 5 posts. Five.</p>

<p>And then... you have to take in to account that most of it was real. That twitter account is deleted now, but they were posting mostly clips of debates, real news that was favorable to Trump, and things like that. I&#39;m sure they posted some bullshit too. But come on... let&#39;s be realistic here. 5 posts. Now <em>that</em> is context.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess you&#39;re never going to forgive yourself. You can&#39;t even process this information you&#39;re seeing. Most of what was posted, even from that twitter account, was real. Video clips and whatnot. And again... there were <strong>only 5 posts</strong> that made it to the front page of T_D before the election. 5 posts is enough to basically give you a mental breakdown with this guilt you&#39;ve put on yourself. Seriously... get over it.</p>

<p>I&#39;m stunned that you can&#39;t see how ineffective it really was. Instead you go on and on about how many people visit Reddit.</p>

<p>How many millions read and trust all of the fake news they see on TV and read from &quot;trusted&quot; newspapers online? A whole lot more than those who read an obscure, untrusted, unverified twitter account. That&#39;s for sure.</p>

<p>Just the other day we saw a bunch of respected news outlets get <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2018/02/16/florida-shooting-white-nationalists-415672">fooled by 4chan in to publishing fake news</a>. One tweet of that fake news alone was retweeted 35,000 times. The correction was retweeted under 500 times. The power of propaganda is real, but you&#39;re looking in the wrong place if you think this &quot;TEN_GOP&quot; was effective at it.</p>

It seems a lot of users on Reddit have the false belief that they aren&#39;t being influenced because they are on the other side. </p>

<p>There is more focus and discussions online about &quot;Russian-linked&quot; conservatives, but there are &quot;Russian-linked&quot; accounts on both sides. The theory is that Russia is trying to divide the country by pretending to be both sides. You have to be careful because Russia might be able to manipulate you by pretending to be a person who appears to have similar political beliefs to your own. Make sure you are the one who drew your conclusions. Don&#39;t let others online push you into an extreme position. You could be doing their work for them.</p>

<p>The critical point you elide is that the infiltration of both sides was done for the purpose of helping Republicans, and Trump especially. They sought to attack and destroy Trump&#39;s opponents. One way to achieve that was with tens of thousands of pro-Trump trolls. Another way to achieve it was by splitting the Democrats: fake Muslim groups that attack Hillary; fake black groups that attack Hillary; fake Bernie groups that attack Hillary. The point was to fracture the Democratic Party?</p>

<p>Remember how they leaked the very first batch of DNC emails on the eve of the Democratic National Convention? Russian trolls then spread the word among Bernie supporters that the emails were proof of DNC corruption. </p>

<p>And do you remember what happened next? The Bernie faction at the convention went ballistic and disrupted the entire first night of speeches. News coverage was dominated by &quot;the latest revelations about the DNC.&quot; Shows like The Young Turks talked about nothing else for days on end -- throughout the entire convention. Many individuals, in those days after the first leaks, vowed permanent opposition to the Democratic Party. They created a rift on the left that exists to this day -- and which shows no sign of healing.</p>

<p>Then you know that not only is it beyond easy to make bot nets, you can write simple scripts which will automate your entire process. It is insanely easy to generate fake follower networks.

    <div class="md"><p>What a farce!</p>

<p>Very early on, probably around October 2015, I followed @TEN_GOP on Twitter.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t matter if they were a Russian sock puppet. TEN_GOP daily posted
insightful commentary and links to news articles that the FAKE NEWS were
completely ignoring because that news went against the Official Narrative.</p>

<p>It wouldn&#39;t matter to me if TEN_GOP was a grey space alien tweeting from a
cloaked Archillean battlecruiser in low orbit 100 miles above the Earth.</p>

<p>Since the fuck when does it matter who is speaking The Truth, when The Truth
can stand on its own feet? And since the fuck when do millions of people ignore
legitimate, verified information depending on who the source is? And why the
fuck do millions of supposedly educated people willfully barricade themselves
like Bubble Boy inside an Infowar Iron Lung to filter out any news about that
they happen to disagree with?  Every day the FAKE NEWS bombards us with shitty,
thinly sourced stories based entirely upon &quot;some people say&quot; and &quot;Anonymous
sources confirm&quot;, and &quot;unnamed Intelligence officials with knowledge of the
matter&quot;, and on and on, and nobody bats an eye.  There is a brain cancer that
has gripped the American public, who now think they can just close their eyes,
click their heels, and wish away any harsh reality they dislike.</p>

<p>Why is there a federal arrest warrant out for some anonymous rando tweeter, but
not the 25 high profile journalists who attended a fancy risotto with &quot;walnut
sauce&quot; private dinner at Podesta&#39;s McMansion, which we only know thanks to
Guccifer and Wikileaks?</p>

<p><a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/11409">https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/11409</a></p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t matter who hacked Hillary and Podesta and it doesn&#39;t matter that we
only learned about Crooked Hillary&#39;s astonishing scale of profound corruption
spanning decades from Wikileaks and Guccifer.</p>

<p>Like the old saying goes, &quot;the Fool looks at the finger that it pointing at the
moon.&quot;</p>

<p>Why aren&#39;t Maggie &quot;Tee it up&quot; Habberman, and John &quot;with me it&#39;ll be the story
she wants&quot; Harwood currently fugitives on the lam and dodging US Marshalls who
are hunting them?</p>

<p>Why is nobody talking about the disgusting media corruption like Team Killary&#39;s
secret roster of dozens of &quot;Surrogates&quot;--high profile journalist fluffers who
the Clinton Foundation launded payola to in exchange for them going on FAKE
NEWS shows to parrot talking points given to them straight from Jennifer
Palmieri, the campaign communications director of Clinton&#39;s campaign?</p>

<p><a href="https://theintercept.com/2016/10/09/exclusive-new-email-leak-reveals-clinton-campaigns-cozy-press-relationship/">https://theintercept.com/2016/10/09/exclusive-new-email-leak-reveals-clinton-campaigns-cozy-press-relationship/</a></p>

<p>All of those &quot;Surrogates&quot; deserve to be in the same cell block as Crooked Hillary.
For fucks sake, even Wolf fucking Blitzer is a sychophant who trades away his integrity
for envelopes of cash and por favor from Clinton Foundation donors.</p>

<p>Why is Dirty Cop Mueller burning tens of millions of dollars to censor a dozen
motivated Russian shit poasters, and setting a dangerous legal precedent to
criminalize certain Free Speech, but doing diddly squat to slap Crooked
Hillary&#39;s bribery and &quot;Pay4Play&quot;? Hillary&#39;s hijacking of the 4th Estate has
inflicted orders of magnitude of damage upon America by eroding our trust in
all news, and incapacitating our entire Civic Society from being informed about
important national events, so that we can vote for the best leaders and decide
upon the most sound policies.</p>

<p>Nah, only took about 10 seconds to look up, too. They had a 40 million dollar budget to fight Trump. Russians operated, what, a couple years at 1.25 x 12 = 15....let&#39;s say they had 30 million in 2 years. </p>

<p>Exactly the same sort of behalf Sartre described in 1940s European authoritarians:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Never believe that anti-Semites are completely unaware of the absurdity of their replies. They know that their remarks are frivolous, open to challenge. But they are amusing themselves, for it is their adversary who is obliged to use words responsibly, since he believes in words. The anti-Semites have the right to play. They even like to play with discourse for, by giving ridiculous reasons, they discredit the seriousness of their interlocutors. They delight in acting in bad faith, since they seek not to persuade by sound argument but to intimidate and disconcert. If you press them too closely, they will abruptly fall silent, loftily indicating by some phrase that the time for argument is past.&quot;</p>

Or read <a href="http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/01/putin-russia-tv-113960">Inside Putin&#39;s Information War</a>.</p>

<p>The tl;dr of both sources is that <strong>modern propaganda works by getting you to believe</strong> <strong><em>nothing.</em></strong> It&#39;s like lowering the defenses of your immune system. If they can get you to believe that all the news is propaganda, then all of a sudden propaganda from foreign-controlled state media or sourceless loony toon rants from domestic kooks, are all on an equal playing field with real investigative journalism. If <em>everything</em> is fake, your news consumption is just a dietary choice. And it&#39;s different messages for different audiences - carefully tailored. To one audience they say all news is fake, to those who are on their way to conversion they say &quot;Trust only <em>these</em> sources.&quot; To those who might be open to skepticism, they just say &quot;Hey isn&#39;t it troubling that the media is a business?&quot; </p>

<p>Hannah Arendt, who studied all the different fascist movements (not just the Nazis) noted that:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In an ever-changing, incomprehensible world the masses had reached the point where they would, at the same time, <strong>believe everything and nothing, think that everything was possible and nothing was true.</strong> The totalitarian mass leaders based their propaganda on the correct psychological assumption that, under such conditions, one could make people believe the most fantastic statements one day, and trust that if the next day they were given irrefutable proof of their falsehood, <strong>they would take refuge in cynicism</strong>; instead of deserting the leaders who had lied to them, they would protest that they had known all along that the statement was a lie and would admire the leaders for their superior tactical cleverness.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Does that remind you of any subreddits?</p>

<p>The philosopher Sartre said this about the futility of arguing with a certain group in his time. See if any of this sounds familiar to you</p>

<blockquote>
<p>____ have chosen hate because hate is a faith to them; at the outset they have chosen to <strong>devaluate words and reasons.</strong> How entirely at ease they feel as a result. How futile and frivolous discussions appear to them. If out of courtesy they consent for a moment to defend their point of view, they lend themselves but do not give themselves. They try simply to project their intuitive certainty onto the plane of discourse.</p>

<p><strong>Never believe that ______ are completely unaware of the absurdity of their replies. They know that their remarks are frivolous, open to challenge. But they are amusing themselves, for it is their adversary who is obliged to use words responsibly, since he believes in words.</strong> The ____ have the right to play. They even like to play with discourse for, by giving ridiculous reasons, they discredit the seriousness of their interlocutors.</p>

<p><strong>They delight in acting in bad faith,</strong> since they seek not to persuade by sound argument but to intimidate and disconcert. If you press them too closely, they will abruptly fall silent, loftily indicating by some phrase that the time for argument is past. <strong>If then, as we have been able to observe, the ____ is impervious to reason and to experience, it is not because his conviction is strong. Rather his conviction is strong because he has chosen first of all to be impervious.</strong> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>He was talking about arguing with anti-Semites and Vichyists in the 1940s. </p>

<p>This style of arguing is familiar to anyone who has seen what has happened to Reddit over the past 2 years as we got <strong>brigaded by Stormfront and 4chan.</strong></p>

<p>Ever see someone post something that is quite completely false, with a second person posting a long reply with sources, only to have the original poster respond <strong>&quot;top kek, libcuck tears&quot;</strong>? One side is talking about facts but the other is playing a game.</p>

<p>Just look at what happened to &quot;Fake News.&quot;</p>

<p>This is a word that was born about 9 weeks ago. It lived for about 2 weeks as a genuine English word, meaning headlines fabricated to get clicks on Facebook, engineered by SEO wizards who weren&#39;t even American, just taking advantage of the election news wave:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>&quot;You Won&#39;t Believe Obama&#39;s Plan To Declare Martial Law!&quot; </p></li>
<li><p>&quot;Hillary Has Lung, Brain, Stomach, And Ass Cancer - SIX WEEKS TO LIVE!&quot;</p></li>
</ul>

<p>For a while, it seemed like the real world could agree that a word existed and had meaning, that it referred to a thing. <strong>Then the word was promptly murdered.</strong> Now, as we can clearly see, anyone who disagrees with a piece of news - even if it is NEWS, not an editorial - feels free to call it &quot;Fake News.&quot; Trump calls CNN fake news.</p>

<p>There is a two step process to this degeneration. First, one gets an audience to believe that all news is agenda-driven and editorial (this was already achieved long ago). Second, now one says that all news that is embarrassing to your side must be editorial <em>and</em> fabricated. </p>

<p>So who is the culprit? Who murdered the definition of fake news? A group of people who don&#39;t care what words mean. The concept that some news is fake and some news is not was intolerable, as was any distinction between those who act in good faith and sometimes screw up, vs those who act in bad faith and never intended to do any good - a distinction between the traditional practice of off-the-record sourcing and the novel practice of saying every lie you can think of in the hope one sticks. The group of people I&#39;m talking about cannot tolerate these distinctions. Their worldview is unitary. They make all words mean &quot;bad&quot; and they make all words mean &quot;the enemy.&quot;. In the end they will only need one word.</p>

<p>It&#39;s also deeply cynical. I came across a 4chan thread planning to disrupt the release and social response to the new Black Panther movie by pushing a petition to give a quarter of its profits to the black community, in the hope that, if it failed, SJWs would turn on Marvel for being racist and conservatives could decry the black community for relying on handouts. Even if it fails it wins, because it pushes a divisive narrative. And more basically it fulfills a deeply cynical need to troll and disrupt. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The big talking point going around right now to downplay the indictments is “if the fbi wasn’t so busy investigating Russian bots, maybe they would have found time to look into the Florida shooter”. Like the FBI moves in unison and every single agent is working on russia, so no other work gets done. I don’t even doubt that there are some folks that are so far gone that they legitimately believe that. It was a carefully constructed distraction campaign that seized on a awful evil action and pushed it forward to create anger and take advantage of raw emotion. It is an example of how normalized hyper partisan shitslinging has become, because yes, some people actually believe it, but many people pushing that know for certain that one has nothing to do with the other, and are looking at the shooting as a good “opportunity” to pile on the FBI, and run defense for thier tribe. I don’t recall this happening when the FBI was “investigating” and labeling BIE as a terrorist organizations, and the there were other mass shootings, so what changed? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So Trump is a Russian stooge now?  I&#39;m a Trump supporter, but if he&#39;s a stooge of any country, its Israel, which every US president seems to be a stooge of, and you can&#39;t be a stooge of both Israel and Russia.  If you want the truth about Putin, yea I&#39;m sure he wanted either Trump or Bernie to win.  He knew Hillary/Bush/Rubio would result in escalated tensions in Syria.</p>

<p>Putin knew that the deep state was frothing at the mouth for a full boots on the ground invasion of Syria.  Obama and the media tried it and the American people on both sides of the aisle overwhelmingly said no.  They&#39;re still at it though, and after Syria will be Iran.  Trump isn&#39;t playing the deep state&#39;s game of a proxy war with Russia for the purpose of controlling a pipeline through Syria, so therefore he&#39;s &quot;colluding with Russia.&quot;  Read between the lines dude, its not that complicated.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh boy, you haven&#39;t read the Trump/Russia connections yet? You&#39;re in for a real treat if you like money laundering connections.</p>

<p>Also, Iran is totally not the next realistic target after Syria. Look at the new Iranian natural gas fields. Owners of these fields have gotten a massive new cash injection from the US unfreezing their bank accounts due to the Nuclear Treaty. They&#39;ve built a new massive pipeline almost straight through to Europe, <em>except for in Syria.</em> It&#39;s the only country that has held up any production on the pipeline, and it&#39;s no wonder why: this pipeline would provide major competition against Russian Natural Gas in Eastern Europe, where Russia controls 80% of the Natural Gas market, which is the foundation of the Russian economy. Oil and Gas make up 16% of Russia&#39;s GDP, 52% of Russian Government revenue, and over 70% of their exports. Now you have pro-pipeline anti-Assad rebels and the Kurds backed by US, European and Iranian forces, versus the anti-pipeline Assad regime backed by Russia. There&#39;s no way Western forces will spend this much money in Syria just to burn the whole investment by toppling Iran.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Perhaps the FBI is purposefully &quot;incompetent.&quot;   Just maybe NiKolas Cruz was on a secret <em>Operation Gladio-like</em> FBI untouchable list, meaning do NOT arrest or bother this guy too much because the CIA has plans for him.  </p>

<p>I mean how can the FBI claim they couldn&#39;t track down the person who made the YouTube post that he was going to be a &quot;<strong><em>professional</em></strong> school shooter,&quot; when the poster used his uncommonly spelled <strong>REAL</strong> name (with a &quot;k&quot;): NiKolas Cruz...  </p>

<p>So just maybe Cruz got a pass from the FBI because Deep State individuals in the FBI were instructed by Deep State individuals in the CIA to not interfere with Cruz.</p>

<p>Cruz&#39;s evil, deplorabe shooting got the House Intelligence Committee&#39;s Devin Nunes memo out of the headlines for a few days.  This, of course, is the memo that could eventually lead to the prosecution of former CIA Director John Brennan and former FBI Director James Comey.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying Brennan and Comey created the Gladio-like untouchables list, but others in the Deep State may have.</p>

<p>Interesting how the Fort Lauderdale / Parkland, Florida shooting happened so close to Trump&#39;s Mar-a-Lago home, only 28 miles from the school.  Also only a day or so before, some evil type(s) mailed an envelope or package to Trump&#39;s son containing a white, powdery substance to invoke the fear of anthrax.  </p>

<p>Recall that shortly after the 9-11 terror attack, someone mailed anthrax (or was it a fake anthrax-appearing substance?--don&#39;t recall) to Senator Leahy and a handful of other Senators/Congressmen who were initially opposed to voting for Congressional authorization for the Middle East wars that began last decade.</p>

Is it reasonable to think they had some kind of moral limits that stopped them from indulging in election fraud?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In a rare but superb news story on the evening of the 1988 presidential election, Dan Rather of CBS Evening News had this exchange with computer expert Howard J. Strauss of Princeton University:</p>

<p>Rather: Realistically, could the fix be put on a national election?</p>

<p>Strauss: Get me a job with the company that writes the software for this program. [Strauss was referring to the most common computer program in use.] Then I’d have access to one third of the votes. Is that enough to fix a general election?</p>

<p>In an earlier clip during this CBS interview, Strauss had dropped this bombshell: “When it comes to computerized elections, there are no safeguards. It’s not a door without locks, it’s a house without doors.” <a href="http://electionnightgatekeepers.com/a-house-without-doors-vote-fraud-in-america/">http://electionnightgatekeepers.com/a-house-without-doors-vote-fraud-in-america/</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly, this only makes sense if trump really had more corrupt dealings\blackmail\relations with Russia than Hillary did. Some take this like it&#39;s an axiom because trump is a fool but it is by no means an easy question to answer considering her uranium 1 deal and the <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5009373/FBI-surprised-Bill-Clinton-took-500-000-Russia.html">Kremlin bank payouts that Bill Clinton has received</a>). Alternatively she was talking crazy with the Syrian no fly zone so if it is all true maybe Russia was trying to dodge WW3!</p>

<p>Putin knows and has interacted with hillary, unless trump is a literal Kremlin lap dog then trump would be a horrible candidate to &#39;collude&#39; with since they really would have no clue what his geopolitical moves will be.</p>

<p>The problem is that it seems most people think trump <strong>is</strong> a Kremlin lapdog in which case he&#39;s a great successor to the long line of puppets the CIA has been installing around the world for half a century, it doesn&#39;t feel too nice.</p>

<p>I fear mostly with this demonization of Russia that people will be lulled back into thinking that America is a model democracy and never would act in an <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_involvement_in_regime_change">immoral way.</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>contrary to popular belief, controlling the vote count in this country is insanely hard to do outside of each county. vote flipping and fractional counting occur regularly, but they occur at the precinct and county levels. rigging whole states isn&#39;t even attempted. the key is to rig key counties. the key counties aren&#39;t chose by size, but by plausibility. you add votes that confirm what people expect for that county, and subtract votes that confirm what people expect for that county. people expect broward to be outrageously blue, no one notices if you add more blue to blue, likewise for the republican counties (they combine several, since they don&#39;t have one broward&#39;s size).</p>

<p>here in florida, dems and repubs duel with rigged counties in every election cycle. you know the counties, because they are the ones that &quot;hang,&quot; i.e. they report initially then sit on their hands until the absolute latest in order to know how many votes they need. broward always hangs, even though miami dade is bigger than we are.</p>

<p>florida&#39;s final count in 2016 was pretty close to what it should have been. you know this because of the votes on the initiatives, which take supermajorities, and votes on downballot races: repub moriartis beat dem keechel in my state house district by just a little more than trump beat clinton state wide. the FPL trojan horse initiative to kill solar failed to pass with only 55% of the vote (repubs were more likely to vote for it). people voted party, not candidate. as per usual.</p>

<p>dems have to have obama 2008 turnouts to win the state. that didn&#39;t happen, instead you had your regular reliable voters voting, more of whom are republican in this state.</p>

<p>that&#39;s not russian shitposting to &quot;influence&quot; our elections. that&#39;s 4 decades of florida state politics.</p>

<p>If you have, they got swayed by Russian interference, since none of those scandals would be public knowledge without their actions.</p>

<p>The difference in the election was 80,000 votes, out of over 120,000,000 cast. If those scandals flipped or denied three quarters of one percent of the total votes from the Dems, that&#39;s a flipped election right there without ever touching a ballot box.</p>

<p>Since this is <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, there&#39;s a decent chance you think uncovering those scandals are a good thing.

<p>&quot;The Truth&quot; you loved so much that Ten_GOP spouted? Couple examples. Google them also to see how much this bullshit spread:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I’ve seen a check that has Nancy Pelosi’s signature because she authorized a payout for sexual abuse of a minor. The victim’s family has told me they’ve received threats when trying to take to MSM about the payout.</p>

<p>Before the election, @TEN_GOP tweeted a series of misinformation, according to the New York Times, such as &#39;&#39;Obama wants our children to be converted to Islam! Hillary will continue his mission.&#39;&#39;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Washington Post reported that the list of prominent people who tweeted out links from the account included political figures such as Michael Flynn and Roger Stone, celebrities such as Nicki Minaj and James Woods, and media personalities such as Ann Coulter and Chris Hayes.</p>

<p>Twitter has said it had discovered that 2,752 accounts controlled by Russians.</p>

<p>Then there was a group cry post in T_D when Ten_GOP got taken down by Twitter. </p>

<p>The Russians have a phrase that applies here: &quot;Useful Idiots.&quot;</p>
