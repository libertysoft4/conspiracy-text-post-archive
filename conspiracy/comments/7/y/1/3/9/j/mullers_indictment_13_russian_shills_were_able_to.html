    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t blame people. I get that people want the things they believe in to be true. That&#39;s fine and dandy. </p>

<p>This is the conspiracy sub and it&#39;s loaded with people screaming there was no Russian involvement. There was. That there was no collusion. </p>

<p>There was at the very least attempted collusion and that&#39;s a fucking fact. That was proven by DJTJR releasing his own emails and everyone knows damn well he tells daddy everything. I don&#39;t base things off of spin and bullshit. I don&#39;t spam garbage. I just want the truth whatever that may be. </p>

<p>So, let&#39;s cut the bullshit and quit moving the goalposts. I&#39;m sick of people being &quot;oh they can&#39;t get him on Russia so now it&#39;s having affairs&quot; no, no it&#39;s fucking not it&#39;s just more shit to throw on the pile of shit. That pile of shit is getting taller than Trump Tower. God damn.</p>

<p>The guys a walking talking carnie. He&#39;s built his empire fucking people over and people here think he&#39;s on their side? </p>

<p>He&#39;s a douche. Plain and fucking simple. He&#39;s played his cards and shown who he is. Come the fuck on. </p>

<p>He&#39;s surrounded himself with unsavory characters, he won&#39;t enact sanctions that were voted on 98-2 and 419-3, he won&#39;t say a negative thing about Putin. Open your fucking eyes. </p>

<p>I understand you guys like him. He says all the right things. He believes in nothing though. It&#39;s all right in front of you face if you care to see it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Calm down. I don&#39;t like Trump at all. Never have. Probably never will.</p>

<p>But you can&#39;t blame trump. He&#39;s a symptom of a bigger problem. The same people crying about him and throwing tantrums on the internet like you are, are the exact people who are to blame for this. You people tried to tell actual American who they NEED to vote for and rigged the democratic process along the way. You said their obligated to vote for this candidate. Regular Americans said fuck that.</p>

<p>Now normal people live with the consequences of the corrupt politics and their blind followers not allowing the process to work. Anyone who hates trump as bad as you, need look in the mirror to realize he&#39;s in office because of YOU. Hell your cheating candidate actually told her people to help trump win in the beginning. She fuckin tried to rig the other side so the eventual victor would be her opponent. It&#39;s called pied piper - look it up if you so dare.</p>

<p>I&#39;m happy to say I&#39;m one of few proud American who can say I didn&#39;t fall to the trap of propaganda and hate since I voted 3rd party. If you didn&#39;t vote 3rd party, you can thank yourself for trumps existence because you essentially supported the party who inadvertently supported trump.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Grew up in the South.  Believed in zero tolerance, hard on crime. I agreed with government is bad.  I was constantly exposed to racism and ingrained some of it.  I was liberal but bought some of the stuff about the Clintons.  I took for granted things like SS, Medicare and Medicaid.   Luckily I had a pretty liberal mother that kinda helped me see both sides.</p>

<p>But the big one was not seeing what the right wing was doing with Starve the Beast and it&#39;s many faces.  They are literally making government small by destroying it and it&#39;s gotten to the point of being scary.  Starve the Beast is dead, should be Fix the Fucking Beast. </p>

<p>hint: they&#39;re the ones who only know 1 conspiracy theory and it has to do with Russia. </p>

<p>&quot;Because in r/conspiracy we only believe in one conspiracy - the one told to us by CNN every morning about Russia!&quot;</p>

<p>It seems that reality is the exact opposite to what you say: here is the only place where the moronic &quot;Russia Did It<sup><sup>TM&quot;</sup></sup> line is openly mocked for the stupidity it is. Is there anywhere else where the stupidest 90% are allowed to not accept the state&#39;s line?  </p>
