<p>b. On or about November 3, 2016, Defendants and their co-conspirators purchased an advertisement to promote a post on the lnstagram account “Blacktivist” that read in part: ”Choose peace and vote for Jill Stein. Trust me, it’s not a wasted vote. ”</p>

<ol>
<li>After the election of Donald Trump in or around November 2016, Defendants and their co-conspirators used false U.S. personas to organize and coordinate U.S. political rallies in support of then president-elect Trump, while simultaneously using other false U.S. personas to organize and coordinate U.S. political rallies protesting the results of the 2016 U.S. presidential election. For example, in or around November 2016, Defendants and their co-conspirators organized a rally in New York through one group designed to  ”show your support for President-Elect Donald Trump ” held on or about November 12, 2016. At the same time, Defendants and their co-conspirators, through another group, organized a rally in New York called  ”Trump is NOT my President ” held on or about November 12, 2016. Similarly, Defendants and their co-conspirators organized a rally entitled &quot;Charlotte Against Trump&quot; in Charlotte, North Carolina, held on or about November 19, 2016.</li>
</ol>

<p>Defendants and their co-conspirators used their fictitious online personas to interfere with the 2016 U.S. presidential election. They engaged in operations primarily intended to communicate derogatory information about Hillary Clinton, to denigrate other candidates such as Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, and to support Bernie Sanders and then-candidate Donald Trump.</p>

Does this mean they were just trying to spread discord in the election? Also will we or can we ever know  what effect and impact these Russian social media accounts had and did they even sway any US voters against the overall spending of all election campaigns and US organizations which supported their candidate?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What made you think I ignore the US in the middle east? I never said that.  We certainly are very very guilty of horrendous atrocities there, for the driven by the MIC with heavy help from Republicans.  And talk about fooling oneself, you think the country that is run by THE richest man on the planet and has a history of proxy wars with the US (which obviously continue in the middle east, East Asia and ukraine) is not an adversary of the country responsible for numerous sanctions that hinder their economy.  Ffs Russia just attacked the US in Syria.  You obviously admit Russia was against American interests in Ukraine, but dismiss it saying I ignore the middle east. I don&#39;t.  I&#39;m also not even saying that America is any more in the right on international affairs than Russia, but it is very very clear that Russia and the US are longtime rivals.  To let your guard down about that is to enable their schemes.  Unlike most idiots on the Internet I am well aware of history and modern geopolitics.  I&#39;m also not really interested in changing your mind, but rather providing truth in the wake of your ignorance for those that are capable of reasonable doubt.  </p>

<p>I am correcting the conspiracy claim, not &quot;debunking&quot; conspiracies.</p>

<p>Turns out, the Republicans made the law requiring these voting machines. It was called the Help America Vote Act. And the Republicans control most of the proprietary software. And Republicans have come right out and proudly announced their &quot;partisan gerrymandering&quot; in many states like Wisconsin, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>So, there is a conspiracy to steal elections, but it&#39;s not by George Soros. </p>

<p>I was given free reign to be loosened on the earth, to blind the eyes and deafen the ears of all who look upon me and hear my voice, to take the lofty houses built on the mountains and lay them low, and make the inhabited cities a desolation. Whatever still dwells on the face of the ground will be cast to the winds of destruction, seized and taken away. Then I will return to the one who sent me, and all who follow will meet me under the branches of the Bodhi tree. The rest will be scattered!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Johnson isn&#39;t part of the club. Trump is connected to a lot of private clubs. Guliani helped him with his connection to NY FBI office, then went to Mexico to meet with the left leaning political party their. This whole Build a Wall schtick has two purposes, works domestically,  but pisses off the Mexican voters when you act as if Mexico will pay. Guliani through the Russians coordinating with Trump Co. Introduced the left to the Russians. Guliani made millions consulting for this Anti-Trump political group in Mexico during the election. Manafort in Trump Co was the foreign agent for Russia, he engineered the Ukraine deal earlier, then got set up in Russia with a financial firm that oligarchs dumped a few hundred million in as seed money (this was way back before the revolution in Ukraine), this money was laundered into NY real estate. </p>

<p>You can Google any of it, am on my tablet so cannot easily link from my records. </p>

<p>Everyone acts as if Trump is an outsider,  he is part of the same structure as was Bush and Clinton, just slightly different faction. It is more complex than this,  but one side gets off on showy reveal of their control and hidden groups,  and the other is just as globalist but want a more tightly controlled system. It is all the same pyramid though, we just elected the guy from the Black Pyramid mentality.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like you think Johnson would have crushed it with right wing voters, a lot of moderates, some light left had he been treated fairly. I probably wouldn&#39;t have voted for him because I am pretty liberal, but you never know, would have wanted him to talk more about how to fund a welfare program for those in need using a market (capitalist) approach. Also, how to reduce and limit our role in wars while pressuring other large countries to follow suit. On principle he feels correct but I wonder how it works in practice.</p>

<p>Also, he is one guy,  you elect him, still have hundreds of politicians with very different philosophies, so really need a bigger third party presence to support.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, I watched it.  He has some very insightful points.</p>

<p>Like I have said before, I think Trump may have colluded, but he didn&#39;t do anything different from others in the past(I&#39;m thinking of Reagan negotiating with Iranian terrorist and the hostage release)</p>

<p>Yes, I thinks its all a political show for the US people.  A little payback by the Dems for the whole Benghazi BS.</p>

<p>US economy profits greatly by the huge militarization we have, and in order to keep that going, we have to have a big bad guy.(Obama keeping this going, was when you realize, it no longer matters who gets elected, Big business runs things)</p>

<p>I never have really seen Putin as a huge threat to the US, and having lived as a kid in the late stages of the cold war, I never understood it either.  What country wants to commit suicide?  Because USSR sending nukes to the US is exactly that, both sides lose.</p>

<p>Trump, IMO is a complete idiot, who by his own measures has created more trouble for himself than any other party could have hoped for.  When he was elected, I at least hoped he would act somewhat respectable, but the dumbass can&#39;t stay off twitter)</p>

<p>It disgusts me, we have devolved into an ignorant people who are severely gullible(on both sides).  Our degrading public education is mostly to blame for this.</p>
