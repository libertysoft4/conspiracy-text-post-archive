</blockquote>

<p>I am of the same opinion.  I have spoken at length with many psychiatrists about effects of psych meds.  All have stated they don&#39;t feel the meds available have the resolution to adequately modulate neurotransmitters in a manner that is highly selective and specific enough for a desired outcome.  They often make large changes in brain chemistry involving many different neurotransmitters.  Take antipsychotic medications- yes, you can control psychotic symptoms, but you often have a cost (severe somnolence, EPS, tardive dyskinesia, Parkinsonian symptoms, etc)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Although psychotropic drugs do have side effects, the art of psychiatry is to pair the side effects to patients in a way that&#39;s advantageous. For example, I had one patient who was a paranoid schizophrenic that thought I was part of the CIA and was constantly anxious and couldn&#39;t sleep. Seroquel worked wonders on him since it has evidence of having anxiolytic effects along with sedation. He stopped having paranoid thoughts (he actually started to enjoy talking to me after a few days and would seek me out during rounds), still had some anxiety (which was managed even better once scheduled vistaril was added), and had some of the best sleep he has had in years. </p>

<p>This is undeniable. I spoke too generally, but was trying to convey the desire to have the ability to have fine-grained control over not only specific receptor sub-types and magnitude of response, but also geographical targeting.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If mental illness isn&#39;t the problem and guns aren&#39;t the problem, what would you say is the problem? ... Other than a &quot;some people just suck&quot; type argument. Not saying that way of thinking isn&#39;t right. Let&#39;s face it... a <em>very</em> small percentage of a percent of the general population conduct these shootings. Plenty of firearm owners are on anti-depressants and don&#39;t go around killing people. </p>

<p>Because I don&#39;t think there is a specific cause or reason. I believe it comes down to a perfect storm of multiple factors regarding the individual. So, generalizing it isn&#39;t productive as far as I am concerned.</p>

<p>People can blame guns all they want but triggers don&#39;t pull themselves. </p>

<p>One thing is for sure : I&#39;m definitely not on team gun ban. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What have the politics/society the past 30 years been like? 
1. More and More kids are now pill popping and vaccinating at astronomical rates. 
2. We&#39;ve taken out God and Morals from School.
3. We promote violence and death in the news, media, movies, videogames etc.
4. We now punish parents who punish their kids.
5. We have dumbed down our population with useless information and standardized testing.
6. We have made it to where one person in the families income cannot support and family making it to where both parents need to work full time jobs. 
7. We are programming our kids on how to be a worker and not how to be a independent thinking adult.
8. We teach kids guns are bad, yet forget to educate them about guns (good and bad).
9. Parents have kids then in 4 years they are sent to be educated by the government until 18 or often times 23-25. 
10. We made schools into Gun Free Zones in a society that protects everyone with importance with a Gun. I would say Children are important.</p>

<p>Those are just a few of the many factors into the crisis we see today. You are right its not just mental illness and its not just guns. Nothing in this world is just black and white. It&#39;s complex.</p>

<p>I will respond to your question about Trump. He has advocated for School choice, which would allow parents to choose where to send their kids. He has advocated to defund the DOE so state/local governments and parents can decide what type of education is best for THEIR kids. He wants the federal government to stop profiting from student loans. He also has stating for along time that our country spends more money per kid then anyone else yet our kids are falling in intelligence in every category year after year. In a country of checks and balances preventing a president to create laws. I think you need to focus your attention on local, state, congress and the senate to come up with ways to better protect our children. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s a idea that might help. Maybe if the media refused to give these shooters the limelight they so desperately want. It might prevent others from following suite. Knowing they would get zero credit and publicity and their name would be buried and never mentioned might deter some. Far fetched and with today&#39;s media would never happen, but we can hope.</p>

<p>Those are just the talking points.</p>

<p>This has been trialed before. After Katrina, Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal opened the flood gates for the wealthy to come in and gobble up the school systems. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s not fool ourselves. This is a popular idea amongst Republicans. They get in front of a camera or get on social media and attack public school systems. They complain about bloated budgets, overcrowded schools, curriculums, etc.. But behind closed doors they&#39;re already operating to make those criticisms a reality by slashing school budgets. </p>

<p>And all of this is wrapped in a shiny new gift wrap. They call it school CHOICE. See, you pay out of your pocket for your kid to go whichever school they want to go to, or should I say whichever school the parent can afford. </p>

<p>Low income or bad grades? Here&#39;s a some government aid to help you get your kid into a school willing to accept the government aid -- because we know it won&#39;t be any of the good schools. </p>

<p>And I know the public school system is broken. But is eliminating free public school and privatizing education really the answer for a country with so much wealth disparity? I feel like that would be a huge catalyst in dividing the country further based on class.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have a lot of very prominent teachers in my family...and they have received several teacher/coach of the year awards. They have told me ever since we socialized the public education system in the late 50s/early 60s we have seen the consistent decline in our students education. Public Ed is important. But we need to get the Feds out of it and give states and or local governments to ability to teach what they want. Also give parents more say...That&#39;s really all I was stating. Thank you for your reply!!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Debunked in 3, 2, 1....</p>

<p>2013, total deaths to gun violence 33,636.</p>

<p>21,175 (63%) we&#39;re suicides. That&#39;s more than 50 per day, triple the death toll of one of the worst school shootings in history - every single day. </p>

<p>If you&#39;re suicidal, especially so much that you&#39;re willing to violent kill yourself - by definition you&#39;re mentally ill. </p>

<p>Also, why are 90% of school shooters either on or withdrawing from psychotropic drugs. Which by the manufacturers own admission have side effects including aggression, violence, suicidal ideation, homicidal ideation, and psychotic breaks?</p>

<p>America has a drug problem. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve lived all over the USA, most of my life in <em>very</em> pro-gun states. I&#39;ve known literally hundreds of firearm owners in my lifetime. None have ever shot and killed anyone or anything senselessly (to my knowledge) and <em>rarely</em> did I ever see anyone handle a firearm in a way I felt was reckless.</p>

<p>Responsible gun owners are responsible. So, why should they be punished for something completely out of their control?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But how many other violent crimes in your country dwarf the us. Most countries with gun bans lead the 1st world in stabbings, beatings, acid attacks, trucks running into crowds and more. DC has the highest amount of gun murders in the US and the toughest gun laws in the us also. This os Most deffintaly a mental issue. But it also involves doctors over prescribing psych meds/anti depressants. We shouldent be talking about banning guns we should talk about our massive problem with the mentally ill and pharma pushing pills that make it worse.</p>
