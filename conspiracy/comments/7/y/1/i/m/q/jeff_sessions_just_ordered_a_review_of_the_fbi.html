<p>You&#39;re trying to set an incredibly dangerous precedent for locking people up. The kid had no criminal history. He purchased his firearm completely legally. The most that the FBI could have gone on was comments allegedly made by him and the fact that his peers thought he was strange</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We&#39;re already there, but it&#39;s much worse than precogs. There are forces at play that fabricate a target&#39;s &quot;pre-speech&quot; and &quot;mind&#39;s eye&quot; in real-time, while another party monitors (and hears/sees exactly what they were intended to hear/see), and the unevidenced fabrications are used to justify the complete destruction of the target&#39;s life. The destruction is covert and fully deniable via electromagnetic toolkits, and to any uninformed observer, the target has merely started to hallucinate, or made to sound like they&#39;ve started talking about <em>every</em> vile and repulsive subject, by casting manufactured auditory illusions at bystanders.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And it wasn&#39;t simply the youtube comment, it was also the called in tip. You are completely right when you say there is a grey area, and that&#39;s where this fell. Law enforcement is completely within it&#39;s rights to come to your house, knock on the door, and have a chat if they are concerned about your behavior. No rights violated. You don&#39;t have to talk to them or even answer the door. If you don&#39;t, however, it could be further suspicion that something is off. A further investigation of public or subpoena&#39;d 3rd party information could gather enough evidence (like the 39 previous calls to LE) for a search warrant stating probable cause (not a huge barrier) that would be signed by a judge and then challenged in court proceedings by his defense counsel if it was thought to be invalid or based on inadequate probable cause. </p>

<p>There were solid, established steps law enforcement could have taken in order to mitigate if not eliminate this threat completely that would have violated no established rights. Hand-waving this entire thing off as &quot;what-could-we-have-done&quot; or creating a straw man argument that it&#39;s impossible for law enforcement to do it&#39;s job without violating rights is childish and infuriating and only leads to more tragedy. We want more gun laws and apparently can&#39;t even enforce the laws we have. Law enforcement did NOTHING. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The solution is not too bad.  We need a reasonable policy that states that credible threats made against the public are investigated and if deemed serious, that they are taken in front of a judge who can sign an order that puts the person on a black-list for purchasing fire arms.  However, there needs to be a way to get off the list by challenging the order, with the burden on the government to prove that the person is still a threat.  </p>

<p>A lot of people won&#39;t like it though, as they don&#39;t trust the government to maintain that list in good faith, and i don&#39;t blame them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand all the information is not out there but the FBI did say they did not follow up on a tip about the shooter. I do not see how a whole review of FBI is required? I would just review that one process and what happened. It is probably like any other support job, the person who took the call was at the end of their shift and did not fully record/report as they forgot. When they deal with 100&#39;s of these calls it becomes harder to have the incentive to follow up on everyone as nothing happens for 99% of the calls that come in. This is my opinion based on my life experiences. </p>

<p>The shooting was a false flag in the sense that the patsy was mentally driven off the cliff to do what he did. Obvious goal is to push national firearms regulations to disarm the general public.</p>

<p>To counteract this attempt the opposing group puts out this statement through the FBI implying that if it wasn&#39;t for gross negligence/incompetence this massacre could have been prevented.</p>

<p>This undermines the immediate drive to push gun regulations and puts the focus on the agencies and why they didn&#39;t do their job.</p>
