        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>If you&#39;re out of the loop, people are starting to dig for answers as to why there will be two or three sometimes four Mattress Firms across from one another at intersections. Someone raised the question of money laundering here on reddit and the thread got really popular and was as deleted by the Mattress Firm CEO himself. Just kidding, but it was deleted for some reason.</p>

<p>Source that the CEO is stepping down: <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/mattress-firm-ceo-ken-murphy-resigns-2018-1">http://www.businessinsider.com/mattress-firm-ceo-ken-murphy-resigns-2018-1</a></p>

<p>I&#39;ve heard news articles speculate something about &quot;money laundering&quot; but I honestly think it is something more obvious going on. Or maybe not that obvious. <a href="/u/Chuckles77459">/u/Chuckles77459</a> mentioned this in a thread a month ago: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Essentially they teamed up with the companies who own the property. Mattress rents the property for insanely high amount but short lease, property now looks very attractive to real estate buyers (because it’s making killer rental income way above what’s its worth) and the original real estate company sells and and shares profits with mattress place.</p>

<p>Almost like a real estate rental pump and dump.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think that this guy more or less hit the nail on the head. But is this an actual thing? A chain of mattress stores can&#39;t be the only one pulling this bullshit right? And someone is getting screwed over here right? Is it legal for them to this?? Or is this even accurate explanation of what&#39;s going on?</p>

<p>Was just wondering what people&#39;s thoughts were on the whole Mattress Firm fiasco</p>

<p>I&#39;m not a lawyer, but, I would imagine as long as everything is on the up and up with taxes and the IRS, then... yes, most likely legal. That said, most stores are independent chains, so it&#39;s probably not the company doing it, but, the independent chain owner, who owns the property. Think: Los Pollos Hermanos, from Breaking Bad, if you&#39;ve seen it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most mattress firm stores are owned by mattress firm itself. I worked there for 2+ years. All deliveries are made by a contracted warehouse that stores and deliverers the mattresses straight to customer houses. It&#39;s not illegal at all. This thread has been making me laugh. The reason so many stores exist is because they have bought out A LOT of mattress competitors lately. So that means more stores. Also high margin of profit on the mattress means just a few sales will cover rent costs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If there&#39;s something sketchy it&#39;s at the corporate level. I worked as a delivery man for mattress firm for 2+ years and saw dozens of stores and met all the salesman.

    <div class="md"><p>I like the idea of a Matress Mafia. It sounds like something out of The Big Lebowski and gives this conspiracy a certain feel. I wonder if the stores are intentionally rented to operate at loss(to compensate for more profitable stores). If they are simultaneously luring in investors(store numbers) a store could be turned into a front/bank for anything. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>And that&#39;s why it would make sense from a corporate standpoint.</p>

<p>From the local level, where I saw everything, it all looked legitimate and like a real business. That&#39;s why it would make sense on corporates end to be able to fudge numbers and mess with money flows. They wouldn&#39;t know at a local level what&#39;s going on but the big wigs would know </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My first thought when I saw this brought up is one I haven&#39;t seen mentioned -- wouldn&#39;t mattresses be a great vector for smuggling, e.g. drugs, weapons, etc.? They&#39;re big and heavy, but can have lots of space inside, under thick padding. Shoppers are only going to try the mattresses out on display, not the corresponding ones in storage. Then the sales clerk is going to wheel out the a mattress like the one they&#39;ve chosen from the back. There could be loads of mattresses back there at any given time that aren&#39;t actually meant for regular customers, right? I dunno, seems plausible to me. Totally speculation though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There might be a plausible explanation, but I&#39;m to ignorant to understand it. Just speculating here, but a city that is known to have a huge human trafficking problem also happens to have many mattress stores. I read somewhere that the highway system (The way the roads are connected with one another) in that particular city makes it easier to move the merchandise easier. How are mattresses transferred? Well there are trucks that can store them and deliver them. No one would suspect a thing, just a truck filled with mattresses going about their business. Wouldn&#39;t it be convenient for you to have an actual mattress laid out for potential customers that want to try out the human merchandise? Again, this is just speculation based of absolutely nothing. Just a thought.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No dude. I&#39;m going to respond to every comment on here if I have to. I have been in dozens of mattress firm stores and know the salesman directly. It&#39;s not a human trafficking front. At all. That would take so much god damn coordination and a salesman would squeak. I commented a few times already but if there is something sketchy it&#39;s at the corporate level regarding finances, not at the store level regarding salesman and delivery men. Seriously. I have delivered hundreds of mattresses and have seen so many mattress firm stores and salesman. There is no human trafficking going on, atleast where I was, but even at other stores there&#39;s just no way this would happen without someone talking.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem would be trying to cover it up or hide it. Good luck trying to sneak around with that kind of shit at a mattress firm store where there is usually atleast 2 salesman at any given time and a number of guests in the store. That&#39;s why if something fishy is going on it would be at corporate levels where less eyes and traffic are. There&#39;s no sneaking around your dirty side business at a mattress firm with how many salesman and regional managers and store managers floating through the store on a daily basis.</p>

<p>I think it would be at a corporate level</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah and that&#39;s why I think it would be happening at higher corporate levels. I worked there for years and you can&#39;t hide anything in those stores at all or do anything there at all without employees being aware. The shops are small enough that it&#39;s hard to get to the back room without seeing a salesman. Plus delivery men like I was were cycling in and out of there every day every other day to drop off product and pick up stuff etc. </p>

<p>So I deff agree and they would want to keep it away from employees so if anything was happening weather it was finances or money laundering or something more sinister it would be at corporate levels where less eyes are and more psycopaths tend to be.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nope.. I worked mattress firm delivery and we load our trucks every morning before our route. We would have 5-15 stops laid out for the day and drop off, setup, and then cart off their old stuff. We used Ryder box trucks and stored everything in the back. No humans were moved while I was working there. If mattress firm is doing something sketchy it&#39;s at the corporate level, not at the bottom level where I saw everything with my own eyes and saw nothing sketchy except overpriced mattresses </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Kind of an afterthought to this --</p>

<p>I just bought a new mattress recently, actually, but I went with one of the trendy new &quot;bed-in-a-box&quot; mattresses that you order online and have delivered to your home with free pick-up within 100 days or whatever if you don&#39;t like it, rather than trying out mattresses in person at a conventional mattress store. I did lots of research first, and those companies specialize in the types of mattress I wanted to try. These web-based mattress delivery companies that keep popping up lately deal almost exclusively in memory foam, latex, and polymer-based mattresses, which can be vaccuum-sealed and packed up into much smaller containers for shipping. If you want a conventional spring mattress, you&#39;ve got to go to the mattress store. </p>

<p>But -- does anyone actually <em>like</em> conventional spring mattresses? Why have pokey bits of metal jabbing into your back once the upper layers get worn out? Why have horrible embarrassing squeaky noises during sex? I don&#39;t even understand the point of that kind of mattress tbqh. Metal isn&#39;t great for sleeping on. But... they would provide lots of unoccupied empty space between the springs. That would be one advantage. Just a thought.</p>

<p>I know they weren&#39;t perfect -- they could leak, catastrophically in the right circumstances and I think they more or less required a heater if you lived in a cold climate, and the cheap ones without baffles were prone to excessive movement.</p>

<p>But now they seem to be gone. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was just talking with my roommate about them. For one, they&#39;re heavy as hell, and there have been instances of actual floors/ceilings caving due to the weight. Also yes, leaks. My ex had one, and no baffles. I was holding the leak shut in the most precarious and painful position as he ran to find a repair kit. You do have to heat it, it doesn&#39;t just stay temperate. 
Basically a huge insurance liability to top it off. So, I can see why they fell out of favor. I hated the damn thing myself. </p>

<p>Some mattresses won&#39;t even say what the chemicals are.</p>

<p>Most even tell you you need to air it out before using it, but I doubt that&#39;s enough. Google people reacting to mattresses. Many people get weird illnesses after or bad sensitivities or breathing problems.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a stearns and foster Emily rose luxury firm and it has coils. No squeaking, no jabbing, it&#39;s actually a really nice mattress. Each mattress has its own perks.

    <div class="md"><p>I worked for mattress firm. I&#39;ve been all over this thread.</p>

<p>The reason there&#39;s so many stores is because they have bought out a lot of competitors lately. Sleep train and others were merged into the mattress firm brand and so it made the number of stores shoot up.</p>

<p>Also, high margin of profit. Each mattress sold is hundreds of dollars if not thousands of dollars of profit. It&#39;s one of the most profitable items in the industry. That is why they can have so many stores.</p>

<p>Also they do it as a sales tactic. More mattress firm stores in one small area makes you more inclined to go to a mattress firm store because there&#39;s so many.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Prior to the financial crisis, I looked strongly into opening a mattress store, as I was working in the furniture industry.  Mattresses have INSANE profit margins.  You realistically only need to sell one or two a day on average to have a profitable store.</p>

<p>Why?  All those models come from the manufacturers.  You only need a salesperson or two.  It&#39;s an easy sale because it&#39;s a need not a want, and you can always get people with the, &quot;You spend 1/3 of your life on a mattress, but won&#39;t spend 1/10th of what you spend on your car???&quot;</p>

<p>You don&#39;t need to store large amounts of inventory, unless you are high volume and making tons of cash anyways.  The manufacturers have their logistics worked out well, and deliver within a few days; easy to convince someone to wait for it if you throw in a frame or delivery.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mostly guessing here, although I have done my fair share of furniture and mattress deliveries. I think you might be subconsciously thinking of all the urban crime and prison dramas where characters hide stuff in mattresses. Not sure it would be the best thing to smuggle with if you had your choice of any sort of goods and packaging to choose from. If you already owned a chain of mattress stores maybe, but other wise they are pretty unwieldy as far as transporting them. They are hard enough to balance on there own and floppy. How do you add weight to that and secure it so it doesn&#39;t drift around inside and make an already big floppy heavy object more floppy and unbalanced? How does a customer take delivery of mattress, unpack it and dispose of a brand new mattress? We didn&#39;t even get mattresses in boxes if I remember right, just plastic sheets.</p>

<p>*Interesting side note, but we used to do regular deliveries to one of the largest military bases in the U.S. and would just get waved through in our delivery truck. We could have smuggled tons of problems through the gates if we had been motivated to. This was pre 9/11, I&#39;m pretty sure they&#39;re more thorough now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think traditional mattresses (other than the newer kind that can be vacuum compacted and rolled for shipping) are often manufactured close to their point of sale due to their bulk and the shipping costs associated with their bulk.</p>

<p>Generally, I think you&#39;re probably right that finished mattresses would be decent for smuggling lightweight goods inside, but you would have to do it in manufacturing and there would be some limits as to how much you could add in each mattress, perhaps making it expensive.</p>

<p>Frozen food is another interesting choice.  You can seal your item basically in frozen blocks and I&#39;d wager law enforcement is loathe to casually search such items because they basically have to ruin whatever they search.  I&#39;ve heard its not an uncommon method for boaters heading to the Bahamas to freeze their pot inside other food.  It&#39;s an effective odor seal and because its food I think its often treated as just a false positive by dog handlers.</p>

Your theory does not work because at least in mine, they do not have mattresses available to take in the store, just the floor models. They have a warehouse where you go pick up your order. But certainly, they could be smuggling things out of the warehouse.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. I&#39;m sorry dude just no. I worked for mattress firm as a delivery salesman and that&#39;s not the process at all.</p>

<p>Deliveries are made out of a local warehouse and then we truck the beds to customers houses and unbox and set them up and then take their old mattress etc.</p>

<p>We would have 5-15 deliveries a day between various houses. It was shit work and shit pay which is why I&#39;m not doing it anymore.</p>

<p>While the stores do keep some product on hand, they are all closed, sealed, and inaccessible let alone stuffed with drugs or anything else.</p>

<p>Seriously, I worked there for years and I&#39;ve been getting a kick out of these threads lately. The reason there&#39;s so many mattress firm stores around each other is because of the recent buy outs of other mattress brands and also the insane markup on each mattress. They make a killing just selling 1 mattress alone and that&#39;s why they are okay with having so many stores nearby each other.</p>

<p>I know the inside and out of mattress firm. If anyone has any questions ask me </p>

They have bought out many many substantial chains that is one of the main causes of stacking stores. they put stores across the street from their competition then when competition suffers they offer to buy but then they get stuck in the other businesses lease. the salesman are all commission based so it makes sense to keep open the store. rather than pay a lease on empty store they put in another store also the only over head is rent and electricity, the floor samples all get sold eventually nso there is very little ongoing expense. Also there is huge markup in mattresses much more than most people realize but its not apparent at every level because mattress stores don&#39;t manufacture their own mattresses. So the cost that the salesperson sees is an adjusted cost.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That theory in the OP doesn&#39;t really make sense.  Any potential investors would be analyzing the current leases and would see the above-market, short-term rate and would be assuming a return to market at the end.  It wouldn&#39;t effect the price unless it was a long-term lease.  Definitely a sketchy business up to something, but I doubt that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Money laundering in the matteress industry is done differently to this and tends to happen at the lowest rungs of it and not the top. </p>

<p>Ever walked into a matteress store and walked out with a $4,000 matteress for below $750 ?  500 if you pay cash ? </p>

<p>Everyone does. Last time I went into a matteress store I walked out with 7 of them for about $500, that&#39;s going to look like a $40,000 sale on the books they show their accountant. </p>

<p>If I have a whole bunch of illegally obtained money then I can start a matteress store, I can then advertise my awesome furniture for 5,000+, discount the shit out of it for every single customer, tell them it&#39;s &quot;old stock&quot; and needs to be sold asap to make room for new stock, ever notice how the receipts are always written on paper ? So they can have 1 receipt book for &quot;customers&quot; and 1 for the IRS ? </p>

<p>Ever wonder why whenever you go in there the employee is always ready to chat with yabout anything and everything ? They figure out if you are potentially going to bust their operation pretty fast and decide if you get the discount or not. </p>

<p>And you know what&#39;s the best thing for a money laundering business ? Competition!!! People will get suspicious if there is one business making 15 million dollars a year and every other business in the area makes 200k, pros know this and they will setup another profitable business right next door... </p>

<p>Funny thing is that you always see laundromats, tattoo parlours, cash only takeout and clusters of furniture shops together??</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess it seems like a natural business strategy for firms with a large retail presence to have a secondary business interest in your real estate holdings.</p>

<p>In periods where real estate is experiencing a huge boom, it wouldn&#39;t also surprise me if the real estate management part of the business became dominant over the actual retail sales part of the business, either.</p>

<p>As side examples, under Jack Welch GE Capital contributed so much to their bottom line that some Wall Street types thought maybe its corporate valuation ought to be done as a bank, not as a manufacturer.  And the car companies have huge financing arms as well.  In our economy generally, once capital holdings reach critical mass you tend to make better returns just manipulating your capital assets than you do in your primary business a lot of times.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve also heard this kind of thing (&quot;real estate is the real business&quot;) said about self storage companies.  The companies are in the &quot;self storage&quot; business, but the real business is long-term real estate speculation.  Self storage is just a very low overhead business to operate -- few employees, basic buildings -- that also happens to mostly satisfy local zoning boards, pay the taxes on the property and so on.</p>

<p>I have noticed that some newer, larger self storage buildings are kind of fancy, and I wonder if they have gotten smart and built a structure that could be easily converted into offices via interior remodeling.  Once there&#39;s a big demand for office space in the area, just remodel the interiors into offices.</p>

I have to agree with you that the &quot;productive economy&quot; is in big trouble.  So much of what used to be competitive businesses are now managed by psychopaths, sycophants and dullards.    Their way of doing business is unsustainable because they&#39;re not doing business.  Whatever is left of U.S. manufacturing is a house of cards.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well first off, the idea that mattress retailers are used as a money laundering business is hella more reasonable than the people on this sub who think expensive art is a front for money laundering.  Literally the worst possible way to launder money would be thru big ticket items.  </p>

<p>As for the rental income pump and dump, it could definitely be true but anyone rich enough to invest in retail space would notice the rent price difference between that cluster and the neighboring spaces.  Still, there are plenty of fools in the world who can easily be parted with their fortune.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you want an explanation that doesn&#39;t require malfeasance: the same phenomenon occurs for specialty stores like antique dealers, or car dealerships. For any purchase that customers will make infrequently, and for which they will want to consider a lot of options, it makes sense for competitors to aggregate, geographically. The customer will be willing to make the trip to visit some or all of the retailers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mattress Firm is owned by Steinhoff International Holdings, a South African company that is looking more and more like one giant scam, ala Enron:
<a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2017/12/19/margin-debt-backed-by-steinhoff-shares-hits-bofa-citi-hsbc-goldman-bnp/">https://wolfstreet.com/2017/12/19/margin-debt-backed-by-steinhoff-shares-hits-bofa-citi-hsbc-goldman-bnp/</a></p>

<p><a href="https://daehee.com/steinhoff-scandal/">https://daehee.com/steinhoff-scandal/</a></p>

<p>So I would lean toward financial fuckery of some kind being behind the plethora of stores in close proximity rather than smuggling. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A lot of smaller retailers (think your home town appliance store) are part of larger buying groups that help negotiate the buying power against the big box stores. I know that some of these buy groups encourage their members to dedicate some of their show room to bedding because it is a huge profit opportunity. I think that they just mark bedding up crazy high so you don&#39;t have to sell a ton of them to pad your income.</p>

<p>If you&#39;ve ever walked into one of those mattress stores you&#39;ll notice there is usually only one or two people working. They are probably just low overhead, high income business models. </p>

<p>If you&#39;re wondering something like that, you haven&#39;t thought very hard about it.</p>

<p>It&#39;s for the same reason that gas stations are often across the street from each other.  It&#39;s for the same reason that in Mexico City you have entire streets and blocks where all the stores sell the same types of items (your music stores, your paper stores, your furniture stores).</p>

<p>It&#39;s called... (wait for it)... COMPETITION!  Being where you competitors are...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mattress Firm was the first (and only) &quot;brick and mortar&quot; mattress company to go public. Since they did, they have been buying up small mattress companies to include them in the family. So, that is why there are two or three Mattress Firm stores very close together. These stores used to be different companies but are now under the Mattress Firm family. Those stores have leases and employees that work in them. If they were making money when they were under a different name, they will at least stay open until the lease is up.  Also, previous customers remember the physical location where they bought their last mattress. So, they are likely to go to the same location.  As long as the stores are making money, they will likely remain open. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mattress firm only opened a quarter of there stores organicly more than 75% were aquisistions if I remember correctly source worked for the company for 5 years. They have bought out many many substantial chains that is one of the main causes of stacking stores. they put stores across the street from their competition then when competition suffers they offer to buy but then they get stuck in the other businesses lease. the salesman are all commission based so it makes sense to keep open the store. rather than pay a lease on empty store they put in another store also the only over head is rent and electricity, the floor samples all get sold eventually nso there is very little ongoing expense. Also there is huge markup in mattresses much more than most people realize but its not apparent at every level because mattress stores don&#39;t manufacture their own mattresses. So the cost that the salesperson sees is an adjusted cost.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No dude. I&#39;m going to respond to every comment on here if I have to. I have been in dozens of mattress firm stores and know the salesman directly. It&#39;s not a human trafficking front. At all. That would take so much god damn coordination and a salesman would squeak. I commented a few times already but if there is something sketchy it&#39;s at the corporate level regarding finances, not at the store level regarding salesman and delivery men. Seriously. I have delivered hundreds of mattresses and have seen so many mattress firm stores and salesman. There is no human trafficking going on, atleast where I was, but even at other stores there&#39;s just no way this would happen without someone talking.</p>
