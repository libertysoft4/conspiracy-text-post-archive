<p>They&#39;re trying to corner the world food supply with genetically modified seeds that won&#39;t reproduce, and which are bred to withstand large scale applications of petro-chemical herbicides.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That case is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowman_v._Monsanto_Co.">Bowman v Monsanto</a>. Bowman claimed the patent doesn&#39;t apply to him since he never agreed to the original seed contract by purchasing the seeds secondhand (meant for feed). The courts ruled that intellectual property protections (in this case the patent) still applies despite being a secondhand purchase. Bowman was hoping to get the Roundup Ready trait for free and lost.</p>

<p>A analogous case would be buying a secondhand copy of Microsoft Office, making 1000 copies, then claiming the copyright doesn&#39;t apply since you never agreed to the original EULA.</p>

<p>Nope, Bowman thought he could skirt patent protection using the first sale doctrine and lost.</p>

<ol>
<li>The plants that come from their seeds don&#39;t reproduce on their own, thus subverting the ultimate drive of life itself to secure exclusive profit.</li>
<li>They use their power to gain market share. They sue farmers who do not pay for their seeds, using high-powered courtroom gymnastics on vague and unverifiable grounds.</li>
<li>They are ruthlessly monopolistic and either crush new competitors through similar means, or simply buy them out.</li>
<li>As stated, their crops require regular treatment of petro-chemical herbicides and insecticides. Let this statement sink in: &quot;Industrial agriculture of this nature causes us to, at minimum, bi-annually blanket the most fertile ground of our country <em>in poison</em>.&quot; The harm yearly visited upon unfortunate residents of the &quot;breadbasket of America&quot; is incalculable. Residents include plants, animals, insects, humans, pets. Every living thing not specifically engineered to resist is harmed.</li>
<li>The potential for this company to do good is astronomical, were they to loosen the iron-grip of the control methods stated above. Genetic engineering, as with any tool, can be used for good or evil.</li>
</ol>

<p>TLDR: This company could end world hunger, but they choose short-sighted, selfish profit. This company causes, encourages, and <em>demands</em> regular and incalculable devastation of nature for short-sighted, selfish profit.</p>

<p>Says the guy who doesn&#39;t understand basic words and invents theories about nefarious vote manipulation and shilling to justify their constant losing of arguments.

<p>Funny thing about this, is that I do have a couple dead alts. Every 4-6 months I ditch my old account and create a new one so nutters like you can&#39;t doxx me.

<p>Clutching at straws and making up nonsense about crushing arguments.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let&#39;s look at some times I have crushed your arguments:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Documentaries/comments/7hsshd/glyphosate_the_sick_children_of_argentina_2017/dqvvc01/">1</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Documentaries/comments/7hsshd/glyphosate_the_sick_children_of_argentina_2017/dqtms7g/">2</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/environment/comments/7hsyih/glyphosate_the_sick_children_of_argentina_the_eu/dqtmcqd/">3</a></p>

<p>Just a small sampling.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m the one with the persecution complex huh?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, obviously. You are inventing conspiracies about vote manipulation and shills to avoid having to admit you are wrong. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Crazy, cognitive dissonance, ignorance, spite and delusion all in one. I hate to repeat myself here but for the sake of the rest of us please. get. help.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s funny, most people go with the shill gambit (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/environment/comments/7hsyih/glyphosate_the_sick_children_of_argentina_the_eu/dqtnkgf/">you do that too</a>) when they lose arguments, but you are one of the few that goes with the &quot;You&#39;re insane&quot; argument in which you just make up a bunch accusations and call the user who proved you wrong crazy. This isn&#39;t the first time you&#39;ve done it. Let&#39;s look at some examples:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/environment/comments/7hsyih/glyphosate_the_sick_children_of_argentina_the_eu/dqujf5l/">1</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/environment/comments/7hsyih/glyphosate_the_sick_children_of_argentina_the_eu/dqukhxm/">2</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/7hssix/glyphosate_the_sick_children_of_argentina/dqxylgk/">10</a></p>

<p>And that is just a sampling. I couldn&#39;t believe how easy it was to find examples. It really is your go to approach. Once proved wrong, you accuse your opponent of being a shill. When that fails, you accuse them of being crazy, insane etc.</p>

<p>But let&#39;s face it, your persecution complex is so strong you&#39;ll never see this, let alone admit to it. You will just continue in your concocted reality in which everyone who disagrees with you is either a shill or mentally deranged. And that is sad, but I am afraid there isn&#39;t much I can do to help you beyond pointing it out and hoping some day you come to your senses.</p>

<p>When you only post negatives about pesticides with which a GMO is designed to be primarily used with, yet have not said a word about the hundreds of other pesticides that are more harmful than glyphosate that are used on conventional and organic crops, your intentions become crystal clear. Where are your articles complaining about those products? Why just the ones associated with GMO&#39;s?</p>

<p>See. it was a while back when the Organic lobby realized they lost the battle when it came to the science of Genetically Modified Food. The science is in, it is safe. So they shifted gears and began to attack the producers of GMO&#39;s and the pesticides used with GMO&#39;s as a proxy. You are simply a pawn in that scheme. That is what makes you anti-GMO.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Yep. <a href="https://www.ota.com/news/press-releases/19681">The Organic industry was worth something around 47 billion dollars in 2016</a>. Lobby groups such as <a href="https://geneticliteracyproject.org/2015/09/24/organic-industry-spends-big-on-unconventional-lobbying/">Environmental Working Group and Centre for food safety have raised millions in donations</a>. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonentine/2013/05/21/organic-lobby-attacks-biotech-advances-obscures-own-sustainability-and-nutrition-doubletalk/#394b01b5779b">The lobby works hard to demonize conventional agriculture while also hiding the truth about their own industry</a>. The organic lobby has produced documentaries like Food Inc., GMO OMG, The World According to Monsanto and more to demonize conventional and GMO agriculture and promote organic. They even fund poorly run &quot;scientific&quot; studies through organizations like <a href="https://translate.google.ca/translate?hl=en&amp;amp;sl=fr&amp;amp;u=http://www.criigen.org/&amp;amp;prev=search">CRIIGEN</a>, the funding source behind Seralini&#39;s bunk. The organic lobby is real and focuses most of it&#39;s attention on trying to discredit it&#39;s competition.</p>

<p>No it isn&#39;t. It is clear you will forever fail to understand this but once again:</p>

<p>You are only attacking companies that make GMO&#39;s and products that are used in conjunction with GMO&#39;s. 
To continue with your McDonald&#39;s analogy, it would be like saying you are against fast food restaurants but only going after Burger joints and not criticizing Subway or other fast food establishments. You are clearly against Burgers, and not fast food establishments.</p>

<p>This is how you behave with GMO&#39;s. You claim to only be against Monsanto and Glyphosate, but you don&#39;t criticize any of the other companies that produce far more harmful pesticides and you don&#39;t criticize these harmful pesticides...unless they are associated with GMO&#39;s. This is perfectly illustrated by your posts criticizing Dicamba, a pesticide you probably didn&#39;t even know existed until it became associated with GMO&#39;s.</p>

<p>But, my words are likely to fly over your head, as it is clear you don&#39;t even understand how you&#39;ve been manipulated to attack GMO&#39;s by pro-organic interests. Like I said before:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Agent Orange was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agent_Orange">invented by the US government</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>In early 1945, the U.S. Army ran tests of various 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T mixtures at the Bushnell Army Airfield in Florida. As a result, the U.S. began a full-scale production of 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T and would have used it against Japan in 1946 during Operation Downfall if the war had continued.</p>

<p>Here is all of the evidence I have been able to scrape together over a bit of time.</p>

<p>Here is a side by side Monsanto versus the people they have sued, with a bunch of other stuff that I have found. This iteration will probably change soon, as more evidence comes to light.</p>

<p>Monsanto has sued a lot of farmers for patent infringing on their seeds.</p>

<p>This is perhaps the most important set of links in this entry. The Center for Food Safety has done (and continues to do) a lot of work on this specific issue.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.centerforfoodsafety.org/#">http://www.centerforfoodsafety.org/#</a></p>

<p>This entry goes into Monsanto&#39;s behavior towards farmers</p>

<p>This entry explains why, and how much Monsanto stood to make. They even lifted pages from Monsanto&#39;s own website showing them displaying their efforts to other investors, including facts and figures on how much they could expect to get from various states farmers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As a sidenote, I am retired, and have decided to devote a significant amount of my time to refute this statement on reddit. I am not being paid by anyone to do this and no thank you, but I really don&#39;t want any. Anyways, this has really not come quickly as I am not a professional researcher, but the evidence does quite simply show that the issue is at the very least a much more significant issue. I would never blame another redditor for not pursuing all of this evidence and staying on them for as long as I have. Every single bit of evidence I have loudly proclaims these guys are being paid for their time on reddit. No one, and I do mean no one would do this much Monsanto defending without being paid for it. I have only chose this single issue out of hundreds of issues that Monsanto has been involved in, and I am quite busy. These guys are always on it, day in day out.</p>

<p>When you only attack GMO related products and companies there is no difference. That is what you don&#39;t understand.</p>

<p>Glyphosate. Monsanto. Do you even speak English? The argument you&#39;re making is that if someone hates McDonald&#39;s they also hate French Fries. It&#39;s utter bollocks and you know it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I deflected nothing. I carefully explained how your behaviour is anti-GMO despite on the surface appearing to be only Anti-Monsanto and Anti-Glyphosate. I suspect the problem here is you don&#39;t even have the self awareness to understand that you are doing exactly what the Anti-GMO companies want you to do. Poor little lemming, doing their bidding without even understanding it.</p>
