        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;ve seen some shit. I&#39;m sure most of us have. It&#39;s one thing to read about weird and unexplainable things, but to witness them yourself is totally different. </p>

<p>So I thought I&#39;d make a post where we can share experiences we&#39;ve had. </p>

<p>When I was around 8 or 9, I saw ghosts. I woke up in my lounge after falling asleep watching TV. I saw a family, two adults and two kids, walk down my hallway and stop, look at me, and continue walking. They appeared a blueish green and features were hard to make out. I covered my head with a sleeping bag, paralyzed in shock, until some time went past and I ran to my room and went to sleep. I never saw them again but years later I found out that the house was built on a very old burial ground.</p>

<p>Another experience I had was with my family. My mother noticed lights coming over the horizon. At first we all watched thinking maybe planes or aircraft. But they moved all in the same arch, way faster than aircraft, and then disappeared. They moved 10+km in only a few seconds.</p>

<p>Those are the two the jump to mind. I still don&#39;t believe in ghosts but I&#39;ve always believed aliens exist. </p>

<p>What about you? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>well you practice astral travel.  there&#39;s a guy beezelbuub or something that gives a how to.  basically you try to relax your body from head to toe..and you try to get yourself to that almost falling asleep state.  then when you&#39;re about to go under you intentionally try to not submerge so to speak.  kinda like that feeling you get when you&#39;re on acid and your body is tired but your mind is awake.  you stay awake, and your 3rd eye opens and you can move around and shit.  share experiences...go visit places.  if you do it too much you can&#39;t shut off your 3rd eye so i hear...so that&#39;s gotta be a bit weird.  moving around with your eyes closed and you&#39;re not physically moving is an odd sensation.  fun to experiment with. </p>

<p>and in the last couple of years i had one of the nosepads on my glasses fall off suddenly while i was at the computer.  screw still in the glasses.  no break or any other damage to the nosepad that had fallen off.  just seemed to dematerialize and fall off.  that was also a weird one. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>when i was around 11, i lived in an extremely rural town in louisiana. i lived on about 40 acres of pine forest my great grandpa owned, it was dense and we knew everyone who lived around us. one night i was walking our dogs in the front yard that stretched out into a field about the size of a football field with a pond at the far end. in looked out towards the pond and saw a large green glow about half a mile into the woods. it was radiating, and i know that no one lived back there. i watched it for about 4 minutes then it died out. i went inside and realized i should’ve gotten my mom before it went away. i told my science teacher at school and he gave me a few books on ufos that i still have. but ever since then, i’ve had a eerie feeling about the world and items to instinctively question things.</p>

<p>Then i saw the most protected airspace in the world get penetrated by another passenger jet, resulting in another explosion in a building.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well done, you&#39;ve managed to memorize the official lie.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They didn&#39;t explode they collapsed, one floor after another.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They exploded. Collapses dont cause debris to be thrown out 300+ feet at speeds over 60mph.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also not at freefall speed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I said that about building 7, which NIST admit fell at freefall for about 2 seconds. But dont take my word for it, <a href="https://imgur.com/a/Tq26z">here</a> is their own graph proving it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Debries fell down at freefall, the towers did not.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again thats not what i said. Infact if you remember, i said the towers exploded.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>FAA failed to report the hijackings properly/gave false reports to NORAD who are tasked with tracking planes in case of a highjacking. Now, I&#39;m willing to entertain the idea that the FAA deliberately misinformed NORAD to allow the attack to happen (which would also be much more plausible than holograms, nano thermite, explosives in the towers or cruise missiles.).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m not here to entertain you. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Pentagon didn&#39;t explode completely either.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;re misrepresenting me again and its obvious that it is knowingly in this case. Do you think that in the 17 years since it happened, i dont know what exactly what the pentagon explosion looked like?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>WTC 7 was struck by debries from a skyscraper and a crashed plane and left to burn.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In this case i&#39;ll have to lean on <a href="http://www.wtc7evaluation.org/">academia</a> rather than your opinion. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t memorize anything, I looked at what independent experts said about it.</p>

<p>If thousands of tons of steel, concrete and glass are crashing down they have a tendency to compress air. What you see as explosions is trapped air blowing out windows and subsequently debries and furniture. If you&#39;re thinking about demolition videos now, the simple explanation why you don&#39;t see those things happen there is because they&#39;re completely gutted out before being collapsed, including doors and windows with can trap air.</p>

<p>You do entertain me though. It&#39;s so much fun laughing at your convoluted and exaggerated explanations for 9/11 (and other things).</p>

<p>No, I don&#39;t. You said a building exploded. Since you didn&#39;t refer to it &quot;falling at free fall&quot; I assumed you meant the Pentagon. If that was a misinterpretation on my side, I apologize.</p>

<p>Ah, a yet to be released and peer reviewed study. Yes, academia is totally on your side.</p>

<p>Again, it would be way easier to just let an already planned attack happen if you want an excuse to invade the middle east for whatever reason than to stage a false flag attack possibly involving hundreds or even thousands of people who could all spill the beans. </p>

<p>If you Truthers are right, why don&#39;t you have one uniform, sound theory? Instead you have everything from cruise missiles to energy weapons. Many even contradicting each other.</p>

<p>We &quot;sheeple&quot; have one &quot;theory&quot; that fits the video and eyewitness evidence, what is known about physics, structural engineering, etc. And that is that planes struck the twin towers, significantly weakened the structural stability and ignited fires that further weakened the already damaged structures to a point where failure was simply inevitable and the towers collapsed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>About 6 months ago I was laying in bed,  reading Reddit and it was very late. I was on my side facing the wall. Out of my peripheral I noticed something moving up and away from the foot of my bed towards my door at an angle. It was about 2’ x 1’ and made of mostly dim blue lights with a few green lights. I was fully facing it at that point and could see through it and it had moving parts like when you can see organs moving in transparent fish. It was so slow and I kept thinking, this is not my eyes playing tricks on me. It made out an eye like part on the side when I’m guessing it noticed me watching and all of a sudden in my mind I heard, you weren’t supposed to see this but I’m not here to hurt you but at the same time it told me it was not a good natured thing if that makes any sense. Hard to explain but I know I didn’t imagine it.  I laid in bed and starting googling anything that I could find on anything like it. No luck. </p>

I have seen a large sphere of ball lightning hover above the ground - between 6-12 feet in diameter.  It passed between two rows of trees, and did not harm those which it passed but.  It burnt a half rotted tree  and then knocked over a very large, very tall tree when it came in direct contact with it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was in a bad place, did some LSD with my brother. We both got skyrocketed into another world. We were seeing the same trippy things. He was like some kind of purple god figure and I had transformed into a reptilian hybrid with godlike strength. My skin changed, literally, in the physical world. It lasted for days, I have scales and everything. Had a pink “rash” all the way down the middle of my body, like a reptile, from my nose to my groin, covering my abs (I didn’t have abs at the time, that was the reptile) and the central part of my chest. Had superior strength and stamina for about a week after. Was intense. Have also been in a different state of mind since this happened, a little over two years ago.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When I was sixteen I was driving around with friends and we decided to go to this supposedly haunted, abandoned cemetery. My dad’s uncle always talked about how he used to mow the cemetery, and would sometimes walk into the church and see an 1800s era funeral procession taking place. I never believed it because it sounded crazy to me. </p>

<p>We got to the cemetery and I led us into the church, which was unlocked. Inside the church it looked pretty typical. Pews, papers scattered everywhere, a couple bibles lying around, I think. I took some pictures and we kinda just walked around for a minute. Suddenly my friend (who is one of the most down to earth people I have ever met) starts SOBBING uncontrollably. I’m talking shaking, tears streaming down her face, etc. She wouldn’t tell us what was wrong, just said that we had to leave. We left and she eventually calmed down but refuses to this day to even talk about that night. </p>

<p>A few days later, I was looking through the pictures in my camera and got to the ones I took that night. Everything looked perfectly normal until I got to the pictures I took at the church. In every single picture I took inside that church, and for the rest of the night, there were half a dozen orbs in each picture.  Like this shit followed us out of the church. I showed my sister and we were both creeped the fuck out. </p>

<p>So of course we decided to go back so we could take our time checking the place out. I pulled up to the church and we got out to head inside. I went to open the door and it wouldn’t budge - it was locked. We looked into one of the windows but couldn’t see anything. I tried to open the door again, as did my sister but we had no luck. We walked around the outside of the church, looking in all the windows but it was too dark to see anything so we decided to give the door one more try, but still no luck. We walked back to my car and got inside. We were bumming pretty hard but decided we would come back some other time. I started my car, the headlights came on, and the door was WIDE THE FUCK OPEN. We freaked out and have never gone back.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Raised a Jehovahs Witness, left about 5 years ago. I was particularly isolated, homeschooled through middle and high school, lived out in the middle of nowhere.</p>

<p>Since then I&#39;ve learned so much about the world. I&#39;ve researched cults and mind control and realized I had been under such influence. I learned that there are far worse cults, sects, and organizations out there controlled by power-hungry people. There are victims who&#39;ve gone through far worse than I did. Pedophiles  and predators being protected and woven into positions of power...</p>

<p>I&#39;m hungry for information and I want to consider all possible explanations for what is happening in the world and with humanity. I love humans and I don&#39;t want them to continue to hurt each other or suffer for generations to come. I don&#39;t consider myself to be religious but I am spiritual and am grateful to have the mental freedom to explore. Maybe I&#39;ll find my truth, maybe I won&#39;t. I&#39;m just here to enjoy the process and listen to people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My girlfriend at the time and I were texting, we were getting completely normal messages from each other but they didn&#39;t line up with the plans we had scheduled for that day. I eventually called her and went to go hang out, the texts we sent aren&#39;t the texts we got. Every text was worded exactly the way we would have sent it (pet names, mannerisms, etc.), looked like it was using fragments of past messages.</p>

<p>We were planning on hanging out, the fake texts we both got were making excuses to not hang out with each other. Makes me wonder if something would have happened had we been alone that day. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t even talk about it because it makes me seem legit crazy, I&#39;ve searched all over and have never seen someone with a similar experience.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t what got me into conspiracies, but it&#39;s been my most wtf moment by far. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t say that I have really seen any crazy things &quot;in person&quot;, but what cultivates my sense that I need to question everything is knowing what our world leaders, the rich, the greedy, and the influential people of this world have done in the past.</p>

<p>We read about all the old declassified government documents that outline things like secretly sterilizing people, Apple slowing down old phones, assassinations of foreign dictators, the untrue propaganda that has been spread, the incidents that are unexplainable, the cover-ups, etc etc etc. History shows us that governments can and will do ANYTHING to get their way. Huge corporations and people will go to ANY LENGTH to make a profit. 
We cannot look at history and disregard it as being incidents that only happened &quot;back then&quot;. Those same types of things are still happening to this day. Absolutely every single notable thing that happens should be questioned. If you are not skeptical, you are a sheep. If you believe everything you hear, you are not helping to rid this planet of evil, greed, and unchecked power.</p>

<p>One night I went camping with my wife and I took a massive dose synthetic psilocybin. </p>

<p>I rarely dabble in recreational drug use of any kind but the occasion called for it... Anyways didn&#39;t take too long till everything was moving wildly. The camp fire was making the trees next to me melt in fantastic colors, all the while every star in the sky was swirling with great viger. Everything in my field of vision was moving except for a single object in the sky. My sober sitter and wifey pooh had to use a star charting app on her phone to see what it was, sure enough it was Saturn. </p>

<p>I tried everything to make Saturn budge. I stared at It for well over an hour and it was completely stationary. Even tried using my perifual vision but nothing worked.</p>

<p>Gotta disclose that I&#39;m not really into astronomy so going into that experience I had no idea where Saturn was.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My dad family grand father=navy WWII. Dad-
was in the military-never really talks about it. 
Cousin-airforce</p>

<p>Moms family- (deceased) grandfather ex army free mason. </p>

<p>*grew up in Florida 15-20 mins inland from cape Canaveral) 
My mom was always hella paranoid. I saw a weird red light an acre over in the yard over in the trees maybe 7 feet above the ground...in the maples..(I thought at the time it was a laser pointer. ) it was just hovering in the trees..out curtains were fully open bc we had privacy screens --(u can see out--/no one can see in. ) my sister and I shared a day bed---I had the trundle that went under I would lift it every night in sleep mode so it was level with my sister bed and we would look out the window and talk beige we we t to sleep. 
-sister pointed out the red dot light in the tree
-I felt like I couldn&#39;t move I was so freaked out. I immediately felt like it could sense I ~saw~ it.
-we watched it slowly ascend into the sky, to the point where if it was a lazer---there was nothing for it to be projected onto anymore and it was just as bright...
-it got so high up we kept watching it bc we thought it was watching us...it eventually disappears because it&#39;s so far away...</p>

<p>-asked my mom about it and she said that it was aliens watching me to check up on the implant they put into my skull, -and that if I&#39;m not careful and it shakes loose there going to have to come down and fix it...</p>

<p>-mom said she has one too and she can hear it rattling around sometimes. </p>

<p>Asked my grandfather about it a few yrs later and he said we don&#39;t really like to talk about stuff like that. (Red lights and my mom sarcastically saying we have implants in our skull.)</p>

<p>Either my family is really good at fucking with people or they&#39;re using humor to tell me something weird. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>When my parents told me that 2+2=3 and my school told me 2+2=5 and youtube explained how 2+2= actually equals 4. </p>

<p>Basically my religious family would tell me “to get into heaven, you must bring glory to god by getting good grades, while remembering evolution was a lie made by the devil.”, all while my school was saying “to get good grades, you must believe in what we’re saying” and feeding me bullshit about history. </p>

<p>Then youtube comes along and explains how the bible has hidden historical evidence in it which actually coincides with evolution but that people with authority changed history so they could keep the power they’ve had for generations. </p>

<p>Eventually it seemed like both groups of authority figures were either lying or ignorant so i stopped listening to either of them and dropped out of school and left my church. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>For me, it wasn&#39;t what I directly saw, but rather the reactions I got from people when talking about things that were 100% true and verifiable. For example, I remember learning about MKUltra and talking to people about it. No embellishment, just the facts. People reacted like it was made up and I was being silly. It wasn&#39;t really their fault: they really believed that it wasn&#39;t true because they&#39;d never heard about it, and because pretty much no mainstream sources talked about it--and there were very few good alternative sources--there were few places I could point them to to get more information.  </p>

<p>Similar for UFOs. The evidence at this point is overwhelming. The problem is that the subject has been so stigmatized and made into a joke, and there are very, very few reputable sources for the facts. So people treat it like it&#39;s nothing, or that it&#39;s made up.  </p>

<p>It was things like this that made me a conspiracy theorist. Because I realized that there was an intentional effort to keep these things hidden or to turn them into jokes and exclude them from &quot;serious history&quot; or &quot;serious science.&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well it didn&#39;t defy explanation, but in early 2014 I noticed western media lying, in concert, to frame the coup in Ukraine as a populist uprising. Never occured to me before that our &quot;news&quot; could be propaganda. Then I realized that in order for propaganda to ve effective, the audience cannot know that it&#39;s propaganda -- and, indeed, actual truth would, itself, necessarily be falsely framed as propaganda to account for the difference. A whole lotta things quickly unraveled then, from JFK to 9/11.</p>

<p>Anyhow, here I am four years later.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think I was about ten years old and prone to question a lot of things. I grew up in an era where milk bars were commonplace, one on every busy corner. I began to take notice of signs on shops and realised every single shop had a coca cola sign on it, every. single. one. I also noticed that most if not all of the drinks on offer at these places were made by Coke (under various names). I started to question what kind of power an entity might need to have in order to make that happen, and I realised it had to be a shit ton of power. My questioning has lead me to a bunch of conclusions about money and power since then.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Before video smartphones got slowed down on a freeway by traffic coming to a stop near the desert. Looked like a nighttime large construction site lit up with superbright lights (similar to those used in football stadiums.</p>

<p>As it was an area with suburban outgrowth I assumed it was a shopping center being built. I could see the cars in front of me gawking at it &amp; traffic was practically at a standstill. I started gawking too. Suddenly the lights all go dark &amp; the headlights of all the cars were now filling the space of the huge white light on the ground. It was empty desert. Whatever was there just disappeared....it didn&#39;t fly away &amp; there was just desert &amp; headlights.</p>
