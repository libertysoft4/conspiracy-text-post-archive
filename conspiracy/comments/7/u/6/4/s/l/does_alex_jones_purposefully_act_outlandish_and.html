        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Anyone remember when he went on CNN to talk about gun control, flipped out and got really aggressive on air? </p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/_XZvMwcluEg">https://youtu.be/_XZvMwcluEg</a></p>

<p>That couldn&#39;t have been good for the image of the conspiracy community, and unfortunately, it&#39;s merely one example of his unhinged style. </p>

<p>Now bare with me here, but Is it possible that TPTB or the elites planted him in this position as an alternative media figure years in advance, to water down and &quot;poison the well&quot; so to speak? </p>

<p>&quot;The best way to control the opposition, is to lead it ourselves&quot;- Vladimir Lenin.</p>

<p>I simply don&#39;t buy that he is a mere money grubbing salesmen (although he does make a profit selling his snake oil products), and I <em>definitely</em> don&#39;t trust him as a legitimate reporter, especially after he went full retard and started to endorse the conservative political narrative super hardcore, abandoning his old platform of rejecting the two party system.</p>

<p>Is he compromised? Was he never even legitimate to begin in the first place? </p>

<p>With all of the memes going around of him acting like a jackass, this is really leaving people with a bad taste in their mouth regarding the legitimacy conspiracy theories with him as the &quot;spokes person&quot; of alternative media so to speak.</p>

<p>My question is, did the elite have the kind foresight to &quot;plant&quot; or install him into this position, gain a following, and sabotage that following when the time was right?  Who else have they done this with? How can we divorce ourselves from him and ultimately hold him accountable? </p>

<p>All questions we should be asking ourselves. </p>

D. knight, and Owen shroyer really do an excellent job. as Paul j.Watson.people read to much in to Jones. im not seeing the problem. people in here are constantly accusing jone&#39;s family of being cia.  his dad is a fucking oral surgeon. he had his paw on a few years back interviewing him on the dangers of flouride AND chlorine to oral health.</p>

<p>It shows how Alex Jones infiltrates legitimate protests and takes them over while attempting to rile up the masses gathered there. Typically we call these type of people &quot;agent provocateurs&quot;.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think he does this to serve his own agenda and to simply profit by selling products. </p>

<p>I think he serves to oligarchs, and they installed him into this position on purpose. </p>

<p>&quot;We need you to amass a following of &quot;patriots&quot;, show them some tidbits of the bad stuff we are doing and mix in our disinfo with it. Also, we&#39;ll need you to &quot;flip&quot; on your followers and lead them into trusting a republican demagogue when the time is right&quot;. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Been discussing this exact point with one of my cohorts for quite some time. Seems like he’s got a pattern of attaching himself to what I consider to be legitimate stories and then going off on his iconic rants.  I just assume that like all media, Jones is controlled by someone behind the scenes.</p>

<p>One point I find interesting is his admission during his legal scuffle with his ex that his on air personality is an act. I don’t watch his show much, but i believe it’s safe to assume his on air personality is advertised as 100% real to his avid listeners. </p>

<p>Best case scenario he’s just a nut job who lied to the judge for the sake of child custody, but I can’t shake the feeling he’s a deeply ingrained part of the system that’s meant to radicalize certain stories to  keep them on the fringe.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was just talking to my wife about this. Alex Jones, when he first started out, tried to imitate the look and sound of a mainstream journalist. He was calm, articulate and earnest. Then, a few years back, he started this thing where he&#39;d start a sentence calm and then fly into this weird mood swing and start screaming and foaming at the mouth.</p>

<p>I just watched him do it the other day in a podcast. He was sitting them, normal, talking to a female co-anchor and a guest. Then he went from a normal &quot;indoor voice&quot; at the start of the sentence and then started raving, and then moved bizarrely back into a more calm speaking voice--and the other people acted like his behavior was totally normal.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve noticed another guy in the alternative media space, named Christopher Greene, use the same weird technique. He starts off calm and then goes into this theatrical mood swing of anger, and then pivots back.</p>

<p>Just like Jones.</p>

<p>Like they&#39;re both reacting to the same script-coaches from some MK-Ultra program.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Think of it this way. The medias uses its power to present itself as credible regardless of the quality of their reporting. Nobody can &quot;out-legitimize&quot; the echo chamber. However, what happens when the buffoon in the room gets something right, even once? The medias illusion of credibility quickly fades away. </p>

<p>Perhaps a better way of describing this is the tough guy fallacy. So long as the tough guy is talking smack and punching down at weaker people everyone sees him as tough. But what happens when the class clown knocks him out in one punch? Even if it happens once, his reputation is shot. </p>

<p>Alex is very well studied in the arts of subversion, and nothing he does should be taken at face value. He uses the same tricks the media does while turning them on their heads. When I see him doing something crazy I think its best to ask yourself, &quot;What parts of Rules for Radicals am I seeing at this moment?&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The most likely explanation is that it&#39;s his style of broadcasting and he does it because it&#39;s effective at garnering viewers. Infowars is a mega-successful website for a reason. Alex Jones has a made a conscious decision to not take himself too seriously, nor filter his thoughts too much. Do you really think someone who takes conspiracies with nothing but the utmost seriousness does any favors for the conspiracy community? If anything, Alex Jones running Infowars &quot;with a grain of salt&quot; is probably the most self-aware thing a conspiracy-oriented site could do. It&#39;s also done intentionally to deviate from the format of mainstream media. He knows his viewers are attracted to his show because they don&#39;t want NPR-sounding, sleep-inducing, uber scripted delivery. Really - it&#39;s not all that wacky or outlandish, particularly compared to the claims made in the OP&#39;s post. And you sound twice as wacky when you sound so serious about it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Short answer: Yes, probably.</p>

<p>Long answer:</p>

<p>In the 21st century, how can you tell? We have reached an age where no source of information is credible and stories are all about clicks and likes rather than actual substance. Everyone is political, no one is responsible, and there are zero consequences for lying no matter how damaging to society that lie might be.</p>

<p>Now add in the fact that real world three-letter agencies (ours and theirs) are actively seeking to manipulate facts and narrative with fake accounts, bots, calculated &quot;leeks&quot;, and a whole host of dirty tricks. None of them ever have to take responsibility either.</p>

<p>There is good reason to believe Alex Jones is some kind of &quot;agent provocateur&quot; or plant. Not trusting what he says or his motives just shows you that still have the ability to think critically. But there is also every possibility he just a bombastic loudmouth with a shtick that has caught on and made him piles of money. Even if every single thing he has ever said was proven to be a lie, his subscribers would still watch, he would face no consequences, and he&#39;ll still have his piles of money and adoring fans. For a man like him, whatever else it might be, it is also a business. </p>

It&#39;s definitely unhinged, but at least there&#39;s discussion of things that MSM won&#39;t touch no matter how clear and present it is. You can take 95% of what he says with a grain of salt, but other times he&#39;s absolutely right. I was listening to him the day he had a guest talking about &quot;interdimensional child molesters on Mars.&quot; In no way was Alex supporting this whacko guest&#39;s ideas, but later it was reported that Alex himself brought it up. It was falsely reported and Alex was clearly skeptical on that. Also, everything he says about fluoride in the water is 100% true. If the government wants to do something as outlandish as mass poisoning us through the water supply, you can count on a water-filter salesman to come in and fill that niche. The ADA has been saying 1ppm is too much fluoride for at least 10 years. Nothing has changed. Alex is right. I&#39;ve got documents! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe he&#39;s an honest man who agreed to become compromised so as not to be silenced. Some of the wackiness was mandated by his handlers, some of it is just his personality, some of it is brilliant showmanship, but he has been taking it to greater and greater levels in order to taint his own brand so that infowars itself can&#39;t be made to live on after he leaves/is removed. Part of the reason he was taken to court for that custody battle was to force him to admit that &quot;Alex Jones&quot; is a persona, thus opening the way for using the law to shut him out of trying to start new endeavors that might conflict with infowars and the &quot;Alex Jones&quot; brand in the future. </p>

<p>Not many guests on Joe Rogan&#39;s podcast have come as close to the truth as Jones did when he connected the deep state and elites to dark ritual magic and an interdimensional vampiric force. If he was 100% compromised and on board with their agenda, he wouldn&#39;t even go near stuff like that. He&#39;s trying to do the best he can while working within a system rigged to silence anyone that steps out of line and murder anyone that gets popular while being out of line. Some people probably never move on from infowars if that&#39;s what awakened them to questioning official narratives, but I&#39;d like to think that more of those people do start to look into less diluted forms of the truth by seeking out more niche researchers (picking up Vallee to learn more about ufology, for example). </p>

<p>A lot of people also note that there are a lot of conspiracy posts on the internet that are &quot;poisoned&quot; in some way.

<p>If there existed a document that proved every conspiracy with perfect evidence, but then ends with: &quot;Oh yeah and (((Rabbi Cohen))) harvests baby galbladders as part of an international organ harvesting ring&quot; most people would dismiss the document and all it&#39;s evidence. If they were later to see the document without that or even parts of the document, they&#39;d still dismiss it because they&#39;ve been poisoned by people like Alex Jones.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think he does this to serve his own agenda and to simply profit by selling products. </p>

<p>I think he serves to oligarchs, and they installed him into this position on purpose. </p>

<p>&quot;We need you to amass a following of &quot;patriots&quot;, show them some tidbits of the bad stuff we are doing and mix in our disinfo with it. Also, we&#39;ll need you to &quot;flip&quot; on your followers and lead them into trusting a republican demagogue when the time is right&quot;. </p>

<p>His family is all intelligence agency employees, someone saw some sort of &quot;talent&quot; within him and thought, &quot;hey this guy would make a great alternative media puppet for us, don&#39;t you think?&quot;  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>He&#39;s a really shitty plant. Legitimacy of alternative media is a bullshit thing to care about because he is very clearly a crazy fuck. He deligitmizes himself and his fanbase. The awesome thing about &quot;alternative media&quot; though is pretty much all of them delegitimize themselves so you couldn&#39;t even blame it on a &quot;plant&quot; even if he actually was one.</p>
