        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">25</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2018-01-30 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/Apollo_Frog.html">Apollo_Frog</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>HDNET commentator Michael Schiavello explains why he wears two watches on every broadcast.</p>

<p>Iʼm a believer in symbolism, I always have been. A brief deﬁnition of symbolism is: When an object, item, word, symbol has a deeper meaning most often symbolizing something else.</p>

<p>Since becoming a Master Mason in 2010, my appreciation of symbolism has grown even further. After all, Masonry is described as a beautiful system of morality, veiled in allegory and illustrated by symbols. In Masonry we use various symbols, most comprised of the working tools of builders, to convey lessons in morality. For example, the square was and still is used by builders as a tool to create perfect right angles. The Masonic square represents a state of moral rectitude. As Masons, every time we see the square, we are reminded to be square (honest) in our dealings with others. If one “acts on the square” or is “fair and square” they are dealing with you honestly.</p>

<p>Symbolism is a very powerful tool. It is everywhere around you. Study symbolism and you will soon become aware of a world existing within a world and the much deeper meaning of common symbols you see every day.</p>

<p>For example, the square was and still is used by builders as a tool to create perfect right angles. The Masonic square represents a state of moral rectitude. As Masons, every time we see the square, we are reminded to be square (honest) in our dealings with others. If one “acts on the square” or is “fair and square” they are dealing with you honestly.</p>

<p>Take a look at the national ﬂag of any country and you will see deﬁnite symbolism. Letʼs take the Canadian ﬂag for example. It features a maple leaf on a white background with two red bars running vertically on either side. The maple leaf has long been a symbol of all things Canadian. The red bars represent the Atlantic and Paciﬁc oceans. Furthermore they symbolise France and England, Canadaʼs two founding cultures.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.enchantedlearning.com/school/Canada/flagbig.GIF">http://www.enchantedlearning.com/school/Canada/flagbig.GIF</a></p>

<p>The Australian ﬂag is blue in colour and features a particular constellation, a separate seven-pointed star and a ﬂag within a ﬂag. The constellation is that of the Southern Cross, always visible in the Southern sky and a symbol which has long represented Australia. The Southern Cross consists of ﬁve stars: Alpha Crucis, Beta Crucis, Gamma Crucis, Delta Crucis and the smaller Epsilon Crucis. The other larger star located under the Union Jack is known as the Commonwealth Star. it symbolises the Federation of Australia in 1901. The Union Jack is the symbol of the United Kingdom, which colonised Australia. The blue background represents the ocean. So the complete symbology of the Australian ﬂag tells us that it is an federated island in the Southern Hemisphere surrounded by water and colonised by the English.</p>

<p><a href="http://daytranslations.com/images/Flag_of_Australia_svg.png">http://daytranslations.com/images/Flag_of_Australia_svg.png</a></p>

<p>There are examples of symbolism in many movies and literature. Take, for example, the  Orson Welles classic Citizen Kane. The movie is rife with symbolism, none more so than the sled named ʻRosebudʼ which, in the movieʼs ﬁnal scene, is revealed its symbolism of lost innocence of childhood. Harry Potter ﬁlms use an incredible amount of ancient symbolism, perhaps none moreso than the snake as the symbol for Slytheran House, representing evil. Those of you familiar with the Russian Revolution will understand the true symbolism of George Orwellʼs Animal Farm. Without knowledge of the symbolism of the four-legged and two-legged animals and their representation of the Russian Revolution, the book and cartoon movie merely plays out as a story about farm animals taking over their farm.</p>

<p>Symbols are sometimes described as the universal language because they present the message in a way that is understood by all and do not depend on words that are different in various languages. Stop for a moment and think how much you depend on the recognition of symbols in your life.</p>

<p>This symbol tells you which toilet to use: </p>

<p>This symbol tells you to drive slowly as there is a

<p>So what is the symbolism of the two watches I wear?</p>

<p>The watch on my left wrist is set to and stuck on the time I was born at 1:58am.</p>

<p>The watch on my right wrist is set to the current time wherever I am in the world.</p>

<p>The symbolism here is simple: One watch reminds me where I have come from. The space between both hands reminds me of the path I traveled to get to where I am now, which is represented by the watch on my right hand. The watch on my right hand is constantly ticking, representing the moment Iʼm in and the moments ahead as time never stands still.</p>

<p>In brief, the two watches I wear on a broadcast represent my lifeʼs journey: past, present and to be continued.</p>

<p>By wearing two watches and setting them to the times just mentioned, I am constantly reminded of the hard work and perseverance I have undertaken to achieve my current position. I need only look at my left watch, see it stuck on the time I was born, and Iʼm instantly reminded of the path traveled to get to where I am now (the right watch). I am reminded of my childhood, my dreams and aspirations, my setbacks, my commitment to achieving my dreams and to be eternally grateful to those throughout my life who helped me achieve all that I have. In remembering these people I remind myself to always assist others in their efforts to live their own lives to the fullest.</p>

<p>Looking at the watch on my right wrist I am reminded how ﬂeeting time is. No matter how great or terrible the moment, time never stands still. The second just occurred will never occur again. Life ticks by, second by second, hour by hour, and it is up to me and my choices to make the most of these cherished seconds.</p>

<p>The two watches also help to keep me grounded. The trappings of the television industry are such that it is easy to get carried away in ones own hype and sense of luster. I never want to become a person who thinks he is better than anyone else.</p>

<p>We are all born (left watch) with nothing. We all start with a clean slate (left watch). Every second of every day (right watch) we make choices in our lives which inﬂuence the direction our lives take (between the two watches).</p>

<p>No matter what your current predicament in life, you have the choice as to how to live your present and future (right watch) knowing that the past cannot be changed (left watch). Sometimes life throws curve balls and may appear to be taking you off the path to which you strive. I truly believe that life is like a river and that river will always ﬂow in a direction towards the positive. The choices you make in life may drop an anchor in the river and prevent you from ﬂowing forward. They may put a motor in your boat and push you forward faster than the current alone. They may place a fork in the river and force you to decide which way to travel on lifeʼs boat. Sometimes on the river of life you have to just go with the ﬂow and let the current take you where it will. But most times in life you need to get out the paddles and work diligently and emphatically to row the boat in the direction thatʼs right for you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Every Mason must believe in God, or a God. That can be whatever they want it to be. Most are Bible believers, and believe in the Tower of Babel story. That is why he makes this statement:</p>

<p>&quot;Symbols are sometimes described as the universal language because they present the message in a way that is understood by all and do not depend on words that are different in various languages&quot;.</p>

<p>This goes along with the tower of Babel story. God separated man by language, and religion.</p>

<p>There is nothing wrong with this.  Babel was a very real place which is accounted across many different cultures.  Too bad religion twisted and demonized it in favor of control and deception.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Close actually!</p>

<p>God divided man by language yes, but also among the other gods, members of His divine council who had rebelled along with Abbadon and mixed with the human race.</p>

<p>The reason behind this is that under the influence of these other gods, mankind had built Babel to be the center of their world. To bring God to them, instead of going to God spiritually. So, he basically said &quot;fine, you want your idols, have at it.&quot; And divvied them up.</p>

<p>See, <em>the whole Earth</em> is God&#39;s kingdom. And the bodies of His followers, His temple. God will not be confined to a tower. You must go to God spiritually. The Jews today <em>still</em> don&#39;t get this. Hence a bunch of pain pretty much ever since Solomon. They preach a racial superiority doctrine, that just because they have Hebrew blood, they&#39;re &quot;saved,&quot; when it was only Abraham&#39;s <em>faith</em> that made them chosen. Without faith in God, they, and we, are nothing. Somehow the racial superiority doctrine of the Nazis towards them didn&#39;t change their mind. And so they continue Hitler&#39;s work, now aimed at Palestinians. </p>

<p>Do you know which god the star on their current flag represents?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The &quot;bullshit story&quot; actually has quite the opposite ending. Once Israel was done clearing out the Giants, God made clear through first Elijah, and then Jesus, that &quot;Gentiles&quot; having faith in Him were indeed to be welcomed. Israel rejected this. Which led them into captivity again and again. First by Romans after Elijah. Then when they crucified Jesus, the kingdom of Israel was dispersed. After nearly 1900 years they still wouldn&#39;t listen. So then Nazis. They seem to have made a pact with the naschach though. Hence their flag.</p>

<p>God doesn&#39;t want anyone downtrodden! But by following other gods, or no God at all, deifying ourselves, it is unavoidable. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t see how Eden was barbaric or totalitarian at all. Not eating of the one tree, of the incredible amount of them available was all that was asked of us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>language is the ultimate form of agreement.  if you can&#39;t agree on the meaning of words then you can&#39;t communicate.  so you need agreement prior to accurate communication.  of course, this is practically impossible, so you need a design that allows you to narrow down areas of disagreement until the agreement is mutually acceptable to the parties trying to communicate.  and that&#39;s why language is phi.  it is a design that allows additional information to be added that decorate the initial idea, and it continues in this way until the idea is sufficiently clear.  it almost always approximates towards truth.  and that&#39;s how it has to be when the absolute truth is not known and there is mystery.  it has to develop in that fashion.  and it&#39;s no accident that this phi design is the basis for language itself, and that it&#39;s the best design we currently have to communicate with one another.  we don&#39;t implement this approach very much in technical things and this is a mistake.  for one, not explaining things in a clear narrative of sequences that can be repeatedly understood leads to the creation of priesthoods of unnecessary complexity and jargon traps that prevent us, by their exclusive nature, from enlisting the capacity of the cohort.  and that all needs to change.</p>
