        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Did you know there is a difference between driving and traveling?</p>

<p>Its true.</p>

<p>Driving is the act of using the roads for financial gain.</p>

<p>Traveling is going from here to there with your property.</p>

<p>Driving is a privilege.</p>

<p>Traveling is a right.</p>

<p>And these are facts that the money hungry, power crazed corporation called the United States does not want you to know.</p>

<p>Oh yes, the United States government is a corporation.</p>

<p>It is defined in the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/3002">US Code Title 28 Section 3002 Definition 15</a></p>

<p>You have probably unwittingly entered in to a business contract with a corporation.</p>

<p>But I digress, this post is purely about the DMV and its extortion.</p>

<p>Another corporation, obviously.</p>

<p>Lets see what the US Code has to say about motor vehicles.</p>

<p>Hmm... Whats this? <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/31">US Code Title 18 Section 31 Definition 6 says...</a></p>

<p>&quot;A motor vehicle is any contrivance propelled by mechanical power used <strong>for commercial purposes</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>Thats right. Only for commercial business or financial gain.</p>

<p>So if you are not paid to haul rocks or transport passengers, you are not using your automobile for commercial purposes, and do not require a license, or registration, or insurance.</p>

<p>And there is no need to wait for hours at the Department of <em>Motor Vehicles</em></p>

<hr/>

<p>Many court cases back up this truth.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;... For while <strong>a Citizen has the Right to travel upon the public highways and to transport his property thereon</strong>, that Right does not extend to the use of the highways, either in whole or in part, as a place for private gain. For the latter purpose, no person has a vested right to use the highways of the state, but is a privilege or a license which the legislature may grant or withhold at its discretion.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/3564703/state-v-johnson/">State vs. Johnson, 243 P. 1073;</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>These cases,
though involving regulatory statutes or ordinances, all
recognize and are based upon the fundamental ground that
the sovereign state has plenary control of the streets and
highways, and, in the exercise of its police power, may
absolutely prohibit the use of the streets as a place for the prosecution of a private business for gain. They all
recognize the fundamental distinction between the <strong>ordinary right
of a citizen to use the streets in the usual way</strong> and the use
of the streets as a place of business or main instrumentality
of a business for private gain. The former is a common
right, the latter an extraordinary use. As to the former,
the legislative power is confined to regulation; as to the
latter, it is plenary and extends even to absolute prohibition.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://courts.mrsc.org/washreports/098WashReport/098WashReport0657.htm">Hadfield vs. Lundin, 98 Wash 516</a></p>

<hr/>

<p>We all have God given rights, and one of those is the right to travel freely and have liberty.</p>

<p>What is Liberty?</p>

<p>Liberty. noun -  The state of being free within society from <em>oppressive restrictions imposed by authority</em> on one&#39;s way of life, behavior, or political views.</p>

<p>Use your rights.</p>

<p>Be free from oppression.</p>

<p>Cancel your insurance, your registration, and rescind your drivers license.</p>

<p>Unless of course you drive a taxi or something, then you need that stuff!</p>

<hr/>

<p>WARNING</p>

<p>This is not for the faint of heart.</p>

<p>Police can still drag you out of your car and taze you.</p>

<p>Police act outside the law every day, and this is no different.</p>

<p>Many cops, I am sure, are aware of this truth, however I am sure there are still plenty who are not.</p>

<p>You must be able to stand up for yourself.</p>

<p>You must research this topic fully on your own, and be very careful not to incriminate yourself.</p>

<p>Simply responding &quot;yes&quot; to an officer who asks if you were driving is enough.</p>

<p>You just admitted that you were transporting goods for financial gain.</p>

<p>Always say traveling, or conveying, or moving, never ever say driving.</p>

<p>And never say motor vehicle. Always say automobile or car.</p>

<p>Also having an ID of some sort is a good idea.</p>

<p>A common law ID can be made by a notary, but a state ID or passport work as well.</p>

<p>This is not some magic loophole to escape every law out there.</p>

<p>Most rules of the road still apply to traveling citizens.</p>

<p>If you endanger lives, or trample the rights of others, a police officer will do his job and stop you.</p>

<p>However, any citizen has the right to stop anyone who endangers lives or oppresses their rights.</p>

<p>Any at-fault accident that occurs while traveling would be your responsibility.</p>

<hr/>

<p>I went to my local police station today with a document I typed on my 1964 Royalite typewriter and asked the officer at the desk to mull over it and explain any errors, if any, about my interpretation of the law. It included case law and US code definitions, and ended with a paragraph about how I have the right to travel freely and how I cannot be required to register insure  and license myself in order to engage in a constitutionally protected activity. He looked at it, and said, yes, this is all factual. I recorded the conversation, and will use it in court if necessary, however I doubt that will happen.</p>

<p>People are beginning to realize that the government is not there to help you, or protect you, or do anything good for you.</p>

<p>It is our duty to remove any corrupt system and regain our liberty.</p>

<p>Spread the word.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What exact case law do you want me to cite? Also you just suck at statutory interpretation. You also realize definitions like you&#39;re quoting are only for those specific chapters/statutes right? </p>

<p>For example, in terms of laying out judicial power, the term the United States means any corporation owned by the government, any of its agencies, etc. not that the government as a whole is a corporation. </p>

<p>And sure, for that particular federal statute, that&#39;s what a motor vehicle is defined as, but that doesn&#39;t stop every single state you drive in governing their own roads and using their own definitions. </p>

<p>You&#39;re also apparently really bad at citing cases yourself. You realize the Montana case is only binding on other Montana courts...right? Same with the Washington one for Washington. </p>

<p>Like all sovereign citizen types you&#39;ve just thrown a bunch of jargon out there and hope it confuses people enough for you to get away with some bullshit. </p>

<p>Blacks law dictionary isn&#39;t a legal document but an attempt at explaining legalese to the average joe. </p>

<p>That older definition is from 1856 (half a century <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=mIszAQAAMAAJ&amp;amp;pg=PA450&amp;amp;lpg=PA450&amp;amp;dq=Driver+--+One+employed+in+conducting+a+coach,+carriage,+wagon,+or+other+vehicle&amp;amp;source=bl&amp;amp;ots=SnoP3t5MZ5&amp;amp;sig=RUJXRuIc1t2zH_RJNs0wJSkp3Ag&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwijluPJqv_MAhXKXR4KHTK_BjIQ6AEIOzAG#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=Driver%20--%20One%20employed%20in%20conducting%20a%20coach%2C%20carriage%2C%20wagon%2C%20or%20other%20vehicle&amp;amp;f=false">before the Ford Model T was produced)</a></p>

<p>You shouldn&#39;t also ignore the second sentence of their definition; A person actually doing driving, whether employed by owner to drive or driving his own vehicle.</p>

<p>The argument of &quot;I&#39;m not driving, I&#39;m travelling&quot; is flawed, since the 4th edition defines driving; To urge forward under guidance, compel to go in a particular direction, urge (toward?), and direct the course of.</p>

<p>Even using your older definitions, shows that travelling and driving aren&#39;t mutually exclusive.</p>

<p>Are all vehicles that can be steered. . A car would fall under &quot;other vehicle&quot; btw.</p>

<p>That&#39;s not insane, you&#39;re insane if you think that&#39;s insane. That&#39;s what driver means.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The right to travel applies exclusively to travel between the states. It says that a state can&#39;t close its interstate borders, basically.</p>

<p>You absolutely do not have a right to whatever method of travel you wish. Just as if you had a private plane, it doesn&#39;t matter if you consider yourself to be &quot;travelling&quot; when you&#39;re flying it, you MUST abide by FAA regulations.</p>

<p>If you want to travel without ID, you can get on a greyhound.</p>

Where does travelling come into this?(you forgot an &quot;l&quot; dumb-ass) It doesn&#39;t.

<p>I love self governing. I absolutely believe that the police over extend. The bullshit people put forth for travelling/driving is absurd and detrimental to the movement. Fuck you.

So, if something kills you, or another, it&#39;s a privilege but, according to you there has to be enough technology to cross a certain line or amount of death before it transitions from a right to a privilege.</p>

<p>So now it&#39;s easy to figure out. Getting shot out of a cannon is a privilege because there is a certain level of technology and it can kill you. Hey, wait a minute, owning a <strong>gun</strong> is a right!? Now I&#39;m confused again. Please clarify again why we must be granted the privilege from on-high authorities and employees of the DMV and/or the Highway Patrol. </p>

However, using a public road requires certain permissions, as they are maintained by the government and tax money. If you decide to buy up a few thousand miles of land and make your own roads, you can go mudding up and down the road with no licence all you want wearing chains on the wheels and no seat belt. But the second you pass onto a publicly maintained road, you are bound to the governments rules because the government owns the road and sets the rules of how someone can use it.</p>

You have a right to travel, that&#39;s the point of the law sovereign citizens like to quote, they let you travel freely between states rather than card and document you every time you cross like it was in the soviet union going between provinces. They do however have rules permitting how you may make use of their roads. That doesn&#39;t mean your not allowed to go anywhere you want. Motor vehicles are not guaranteed in the constitution any more than teleportation or space travel is. Your free to go there, but they can limit how you use their property if they choose.</p>

<p>Rights: a moral or legal entitlement to have or obtain something or to act in a certain way. </p>

<p>Privilege: a special right, advantage, or immunity granted or available only to a particular person or group of people. I.e. people with a driver&#39;s licence can drive on public roads.</p>

<p>A privilege can be revoked or have conditions to have it. A right cannot be conditional.</p>

<p>It is literally by definition a privilege. They do not HAVE to let you be capable of driving on the road. If you doubt that, try arguing your rights when you have a suspended licence, see where that gets you. </p>

<p>Just because you have a moral outrage at the use of the word does not make the definition incorrect.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. My mother had her kneecap shattered in a parking lot by an inattentive driver. Then later in life when she got by with a cane and bright red coat, it was alarming the number of people who still nearly clip her in the middle of a crosswalk.</p>

<p>I do not understand why SocCits feel things like driving is a right. You don&#39;t HAVE to be permitted to operate a dangerous vehicle that can maim/kill someone with a moments inattention to get around. There are plenty of alternatives if you demonstrate it cannot be done safely. If you text and drive you SHOULD have your licence taken away. But apparently they should be able to do anything no matter how it affects others because it&#39;s them. The degree of narcissism and focus only on how it affects themselves is staggering sometimes. Even the above posters argument boils down to &quot;It&#39;s my right because &#39;I&#39; say so&quot; without any kind of thought on any position that doesn&#39;t affect them. And becomes aggressive and abusive if they are challenged. </p>

<p>I expect the DMV is an extension of that. They should just be able to drive. They feel any kind of challenge to that authority is abuse, and the fact it&#39;s a crowded government agency to boot is some sort of personal insult. It&#39;s the only explanation I can think of for the hate of the DMV. The LONGEST time I&#39;ve ever spent there was maybe 90 minutes, where I read a book and ate a snack, and had it done in ten minutes once I was called up. Once every 3-4 years, less often than that in many states. But people act like it&#39;s the incarnation of hell.</p>

<p>Oh yes, the United States government is a corporation.</p>

<p>It is defined in the US Code Title 28 Section 3002 Definition 15</p>

<p>No, it&#39;s not. You&#39;re obviously talking about definition #15: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>(15) “United States” means—
(A) a Federal corporation;
(B) an agency, department, commission, board, or other entity of the United States; or
(C) an instrumentality of the United States.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Notice the &quot;or&quot; there. That means that, for the purposes of that chapter, the phrase &quot;the United States&quot; could refer to any of those things. Okay, why does that matter? Because that chapter is about debt collection. And guess what? There&#39;s several government-owned corporations (Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac) that are in the debt collection business. So when that chapter says (for example) &quot;You have to repay your debt to the United States or else these are the consequences...&quot; the law is saying (in part) that you have to repay the debt you owe on the loan you took out from Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac.</p>

<p>TLDR: It doesn&#39;t mean the United States is a corporation. It means that when it says, in the context of debt collection, that &quot;the United States&quot; can also refer to government-owned debt collection corporations.</p>

<p>Further, even if using roads for, &quot;traveling,&quot; as you have defined it, was governed by federal law, it is a tenant of federal (and state) civil procedure that simply by using public highways for any purpose, one has entered into a reciprocal agreement with that jurisdiction to be beholden to its authority. This means that just by using publicly funded infrastructure, like roads and highways, you agree to submit to the laws of that jurisdiction, regardless of your purpose. The laws of every state require licensing to operate a motor vehicle, and therefore if you use a public road, you have agreed to apply for and maintain your privilege to operate a motor vehicle, via licensing. Even if the federal government explicitly did not require licensing for &quot;traveling&quot;, the Erie doctrine would require the government to apply the licensing law of the state in which the event occurred, which unanimously require licensing.</p>

<p>The idea that the operation of a motor vehicle for non-commercial purposes exists as a right is laughable after even a modicum of reflection - if such an activity existed as a right, at what point would minors be allowed to exercise that right? Immediately? At the age of majority? If an individual was blind, it would be illegal to restrict their right to drive, thereby endangering everyone, including pedestrians. Every attempt to regulate transit would become a civil rights claim, further congesting the courts, and costing taxpayers. Even if the legislature intended for driving to be a right and not a privilege, the legislature would have changed it in the interests of judicial economy.</p>

<p>The notion of differentiating between private sector use and public use is, firstly, impossible to regulate, and second, the result of not only improper statutory interpretation but also a complete misunderstanding of the laws of the United States. Even if the wording was originally intended to differentiate transit in the way you have misconstrued, its application today exclusively treats motor transit as a single type- the hallmark of US law is its ability to adapt to the times via precedent. Ergo, you&#39;re wrong, and even if you were correct in your statutory interpretation, you&#39;re still wrong. Also, an idiot who I cannot wait to watch get lawfully arrested on YouTube.</p>

<p>You must understand that when you pretend to be someone who understands the law, the lazy, the naive, and the stupid will believe you, particularly when you slap two cases in your post to lend your &quot;argument&quot; credence. Both of those cases have been cherry picked for a quote that disregards the context in which they were made, which is dishonest and manipulative. I will not enter into a firing of caselaw back and forth with you because you are obviously not a lawyer and have proven yourself incapable of understanding statutory construction, interpretation, and precedent. When you attempt to mislead people as you have, you can cause them or bystanders to be fined, unable to obtain just remedy, injured, or killed. The ramifications of your erroneous interpretation of the law have real world effects, so please put down your device, burn your keyboard, and cease enjoying your right to free speech.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you can travel in a car, just can&#39;t travel on a road. Your welcome to drive a tractor or go cart on your own property. But once you go onto public property you better have a licence to do so. Or get an elaborate chain of permissions to travel through a series of private properties between you and your destination so you can just cut across everyone&#39;s lawn to get there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;ve cited a tiny portion of two cases that don&#39;t say what you think they do. How come you can&#39;t cite a single case where this argument has actually gotten off someone for driving without a licence? </p>

<p>Let&#39;s assume you&#39;re right. You&#39;re not. If you&#39;re right then all of the cops and all of the courts think you&#39;re wrong. God gives you no rights. The rights you have are limited to what a court agrees they are. The court says you&#39;re wrong and you&#39;ll rot in prison for contempt until you agree with it.</p>
