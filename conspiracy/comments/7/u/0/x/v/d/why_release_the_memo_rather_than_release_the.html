<p>Seems to me the devil is always in the details. If we have an entire report we can decide what is in it rather than have someone cherrypick select parts of it to make conclusions for us.</p>

<p>Which would you rather be released? Or why not release both? I dont get it. Help me understand.</p>

<p>The memo leaves out key details about interactions between Carter Page and Russian intelligence officers that would be considered highly classified. The Nunes memo that is being released is going to try and portray Carter Page as an innocent civillian that never engaged in clandestine activities.</p>

<p>Nunes is leaving out key details for a reason.</p>

<p>The memo is going to allege that the FISA warrant application on Carter Page included information from the Steele Dossier, without disclosing that the Dossier was paid for by DNC and Clinton sources. </p>

<p>The memo is not going to include any information that the CIA or any other foreign intelligence community have collected on communications that Carter Page had with Russian agents before the period that the FISA warrant was approved in 2016. The memo is not going to include anything from the 2013 SVR spy ring that was used to recruit Page and collect intelligence about Page&#39;s desire to get rich through energy deals in Gazprom.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The intel community hasn&#39;t put anything official out about Carter Page being recruited in 2013. Carter Page himself confirmed he was a target of recruitment efforts back in 2013.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What do you think they did wrong?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Absolutely nothing. </p>

<p>Carter Page was acting as an agent of a foreign government during the 2016 election and the dossier was very accurate reporting on that claim. The FISA warrants presented for Page specifically were able to get renewed into 2017 and for good reason.</p>

<p>Typically newspaper &quot;sources&quot; <em>are</em> the intel community.  </p>

<p>Well according to some reports, the report is going to prove the Dems (Killary, Obama, DOJ, FBI heads colluded in something worse than Watergate and justified spying on Trump during the campaign and bugging the Trump tower)</p>

<p>If this is true, absolutely 100% the people need to know and criminal charges/indictments need to happen asap. Mccabe just stepped down yesterday and the CEO of the DNC as well, so basically they know whats coming and its bad, so bad they both stepped down</p>

<p>You can choose to be if you want. I choose to be a spectator and help out by having written a book that&#39;s out there that helps breakdown the illusions and brainwashing, so for me, that&#39;s helping and giving back.</p>

<p>In terms of solving this: I 100% believe there is a deep state war, more than that, a globalist war against nationalist, elites, banksters, etc, there are many fronts, and good and bad guys on each front, the war will continue wayyyyy past the times our bodies die</p>

<p>I have a YT channel where I drop videos where I discuss how a number of things are connected, for example the estrogen mimicry chemicals in Soy (Soy Lattes, Soy Milk), the chems in plastics leeching into our food/drinks, the big pharma pills that get pissed out into toilets which ends up back in the ground water and in the water supply, and the herbicide finding its way into the food supply as well, this combo of being bombarded from every angle in American food/water supply is creating a chain reaction of feminization in the culture that can be seen in a number of ways and statistics that back it. So I go on this 45 minute rant with links, sources, studies etc about, for example a topic like this.</p>

<p>My channel ended up relatively blowing up pretty big, so I put a book out that&#39;s both free or you can buy a copy, just as a way to give back, and have 3000 downloads and sell about 3-5 a month (after amazon takes its cut though, its just peanuts, like $7 a book, plus have to pay taxes.</p>

<p>So basically self published, I used createspace, then have a pdf .mobi for download</p>

<p>I was looking into it for political reasons (Green Party) but didn&#39;t find any organic civic response to encourage. Lot&#39;s of angry people pointing fingers, not very many people bagging stinky slime. Always disappointing to me.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a pretty complex case. The ineffective civic response came when the slime started showing up in the parts of the inland irrigation system that run through populous areas. It&#39;s all ACE stuff--straight as an arrow and ugly as sin--but its been there a long time and doesn&#39;t look so bad with some growth. </p>

<p>There would be no Democratic memo if there were not a Republican memo. You need to calibrate your &quot;both&quot; sides meter. They are not the same.</p>

<p>Republicans have chosen to write up and make public a conclusory memo of cherry-picked data and interpretations (to put it as nicely as possible), so Democrats wrote up a response.</p>

<p>The biggest problem with the memo is who is releasing it. Nunes is massively biased and as such this memo cannot be taken on faith alone. Besides this, the Republican memo is unsourced which means nothing can be independently verified.</p>

<p><em>Several leftwing activist groups have filed accusations against me with the Office of Congressional Ethics. The charges are entirely false and politically motivated, and are being leveled just as the American people are beginning to learn the truth about the improper unmasking of the identities of U.S. citizens and other abuses of power. Despite the baselessness of the charges, I believe it is in the best interests of the House Intelligence Committee and the Congress for me to have Representative Mike Conaway, with assistance from Representatives Trey Gowdy and Tom Rooney, temporarily take charge of the Committee’s Russia investigation while the House Ethics Committee looks into this matter.</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, yes the House Intelligence Committee drew on unnamed sources to complete the memo. /s  </p>

<hr/>

<p>Yes she does seem to have her hands full with four current investigations and possibly more to come. </p>

<p><strong>The Clinton Foundation</strong>  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Hill reported on Thursday that the FBI has launched a new investigation into the Clinton Foundation which focuses on whether the Clinton’s engaged in any pay-to-play politics or other illegal activities during Clinton’s time as Secretary of State in the Obama administration.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr/>

<p><strong>Clinton’s Use Of A Private Email Server</strong>  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>On Thursday, The Hill published a report from John Solomon which featured former FBI director James Comey’s original draft on the investigation into Clinton’s use of a private email server. The draft showed that the term “gross negligence” was used multiple times and specifically said that there was evidence to conclude that Clinton committed a felony. Anti-Trump FBI agent Peter Strzok, who texted about having an “insurance policy” against Trump’s election, softened the language in Comey’s draft so Clinton could avoid possible criminal charges.  </p>

<p>A senior law enforcement official told Solomon that the DOJ “was exploring whether any issues from that probe should be re-opened but cautioned the effort was not at the stage of a full investigation.”  </p>
</blockquote>

<hr/>

<p><strong>Uranium One</strong>  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered federal prosecutors at the DOJ in December to begin interviewing FBI agents about the evidence they collected during a criminal investigation into the controversial Uranium One deal, which directly involved the Clintons.  </p>

<p>There are multiple aspects at play in this investigation, from the Obama administration threatening a witness to stay quiet because they did not want him testifying to Congress because it would impact the 2016 presidential election, to the Russian officials who were engaged in bribery, kickbacks, extortion, and money laundering directly connected to the Uranium One deal.   </p>
</blockquote>

<hr/>

<p><strong>The Obama Administration Ending Investigations Into Hezbollah</strong>  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>In December, Politico published a bombshell report about how the Obama administration ended a massive federal investigation, dubbed “Project Cassandra,” into the Iranian-backed terrorist organization Hezbollah. The Obama administration’s decision to sabotage the investigation so it could secure the Iran nuclear deal allowed Hezbollah to traffic hundreds of millions of dollars worth of cocaine into the United States and allowed them to operate “the largest material support scheme for terrorism operations the world had ever seen.”    </p>

<p>A little over a week after the report came out, congressional leaders announced that they were launching an investigation into the Obama administration’s efforts to end the Hezbollah investigation. <strong>This could include investigating Clinton because she was Obama’s Secretary of State from 2009 to 2013 and the State Department was involved in the Obama administration’s efforts to end the investigation, according to the report.</strong> Politico reported, “Further complicating the picture was the role of the State Department, which often wanted to quash both law-enforcement actions and covert operations due to the political backlash they created.”    </p>

<p>Nunes and other key Republicans on the Hill sent aides or went themselves to review documents at the Justice Department, and Nunes&#39; senior committee staffers compiled a comprehensive review of points of concern. They focused on the information the agencies used to prompt applications for warrants, Republicans familiar with their work said. Those analyses eventually became the memo</p>

<p>I bet you think congressmen write their own bills too?</p>

<p>The key part about sources:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Justice Department has suggested publicly that Nunes himself did not review the materials that formed the basis for the memo - apparently instead relying on staff to brief him. One key player is a Justice Department alum: Kashyap Patel, who had worked as a prosecutor in the Justice Department&#39;s National Security Division and was famously berated by a federal judge in Texas over his failure to wear a suit and tie.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s a scenario. </p>

<p>A Republican who is charged with chairing a committee that oversees the FBI, writes a memo that may claim that the FBI has been corrupted and politicized by the Democrats. </p>

<p>If this is true, it&#39;ll be a scandal that will dwarf Watergate and J Edgar Hoovers corruption scandal put together. This shit is major shit.</p>

<p>But.. the Democrats, predictably, say bullshit, the Republicans are being partisan and are attacking the FBI unfairly and abusing their power just to go after the Dems.</p>

<p>Now, it&#39;s a bit of a political standoff, isn&#39;t it. </p>

<p>What do we do now? Ignore it? Take the Dems word for it? Not bother with it? Say, oh okay, not to worry, we believe in the Dems and the FBI despite the emails and the text messages, and ignore the FISA warrant that allowed Obama&#39;s administration to spy on the opposition candidate and his campaign?</p>

<p>Are we gonna just accept that this is a corrupt banana republic and out govts can spy on any political opponent?</p>

<p>Or are we going to investigate and see where the investigation takes us?</p>

<p>I think at the very least this warrants a fair and impartial investigation. Don&#39;t you?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s another scenario:</p>

<p>A Republican who is charged with overseeing an investigation into his superior writes a memo which implicates the very investigatory agency that is investigating his superior. This Republican has <em>already</em> proven himself to be willing to protect that very superior, and had to recuse himself for doing it.</p>

<p>Which scenario is simpler? Trump having committed a crime, or <em>an entire agency</em> framing him for committing a crime?</p>

<p>Nunes has already shown himself willing to protect Trump. <em>He even recused himself from the investigation</em>. But now he&#39;s conveniently got a memo, based on secret evidence, which says that not only is Trump innocent, but that he&#39;s being <em>framed</em>. His fellow Republicans will allow <em>this</em> memo to be made public... but not one written by the Democrats.</p>

<p>I think the issues involve people like Comey, McCabe, Strozk and his colleague and main squeeze. And several others.</p>

<p>You see, the reason I ask is that until he was investigating Trump, Mueller was well respected on both sides of the aisle. He&#39;s a lifelong Republican, and has served the country with distinction.</p>

<p>Until he started investigating Trump, that is. Now, according to the people he&#39;s investigating, he&#39;s biased and very likely a traitor. When he found out that someone on his team had written a text critical of Trump, he fired the guy... but apparently that wasn&#39;t enough. Apparently, Mueller&#39;s entire investigation is now tainted.</p>

<p>Because he did the <em>right</em> thing.</p>

<p>Kenneth Starr set out with a goal of finding something, <em>anything</em> on Bill Clinton. Jason Chaffetz was prepared for <em>years</em> of investigation into Hillary Clinton if she&#39;d won. But now we&#39;ve got Republicans complaining that any investigation into their President is a witch hunt? Please.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They have been suggesting this. The Dems have been resisting it and accusing Trump of attacking the FBI without reason and committing an abuse of power. The DOJ and Sessions have been slow to act on it. They seem to not be ready to act on it.</p>

<p>The memo lays it all out and people who read it can determine if there is nothing to it all, like the Dems claim, or there&#39;s enough smoke to investigate if there&#39;s fire. Maybe when the facts, or at least Nunes version of the facts, are made public, maybe Sessions and the DOJ will have to act on it.</p>

<p>And for all we know, the memo might be a big nothing burger. Or it may have enough in it to justify an investigation. And that investigation may come up with nothing. or it may come up with enough to put some people in jail.</p>

<p>Either way, I find it suspicious when people resist investigations. If you&#39;re innocent, you invite investigations. If you&#39;re guilty, the last thing you need is an investigation.</p>

<p>Considering the importance this has to the very democratic foundations of the USA and the serious nature of the threat of deep state actors in the FBI and other agencies, I don&#39;t see how anyone can resist an investigation.

<p>He&#39;s not. As far as I know he&#39;s going along with it. Even tho he&#39;s got the constitutional power to shut Mueller down any time he wants to.

<p>He still has the power to shut it down. It&#39;s been done before. I know the vast majority of people will not give a rats ass if he shuts it down. Or if his lawyer quit. In the end, the voters will get the last word in the next election. Which he is very likely to win even with Muellers circus.</p>

<p>Was he not the minority chair on that committee. The Democrat majority &quot;found nothing wrong&quot;. There was lots wrong. And if Hillary had been elected, that would have been buried even deeper. Everyone knows what Hillary did in the Benghazi fiasco. In the end, she lost that one. And the election, at least partly because of Benghazi.</p>

<p>So take your bs logic and shove it.</p>

<p>I would really like to see both but it doesn&#39;t seem that they are taking the steps needed to make that happen.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because the democrats are allowing the DOJ to look at their memo to make sure that none of what they say actively harms an ongoing investigation.</p>

<p>But either way, Republicans voted to allow house members to read it, but not allow Democrats to release. This is because Republicans want their memo to be released with no opposition to do as much damage as possible before the other side can respond.</p>

<p>Hopefully people will realize this and take the memo with a huge grain of salt, at least until we get the other side.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it has to do with the idea that specific elected officials are in the positions to oversee the system. They sit on congressional and/or senate committees to oversee this stuff. A lot of the stuff they look at is very very sensitive. They represent or are supposed to represent the citizens best interests. It is set up this way to allow for oversight without making all the details public and possibly hampering these agencies sensitive activities.</p>

<p>I&#39;m guessing that the memo is general enough to give us a good idea of what was going on, and the sources and some of the sensitive details of all this information is not out there for everyone to see. While the report will likely contain stuff that is pretty sensitive but not really important to know to understanding what went on.</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s about protecting legit sensitive info while still giving the true story of what&#39;s been going on at the FBI.</p>

<p>The idea is to expose the corruption without wrecking any legal cases that will need to be pursued subsequently and while not spilling state secrets or harming or exposing legitimately good sources.</p>

<p>Something like that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It seems so strange to me that this entire sub wasn’t basically saying this instead of just the memo. For a sub that’s so much about just getting to the truth of something why even bother with either parties memo? Fuck it just release it all and leave it open for any jackass in the world to write a memo about the information. If it shows what Nunes says then no big deal plenty of people on this sub and everywhere will find it and post it across the web. </p>

<p>My only question on this entire topic is what happens if the memo isn’t truthful? What if that memo is basically like some posts on here drawing random strings and connections that the source document doesn’t and it’s all just nonsense? We would never know unless the whole report gets released. I just don’t see how that benefits the truth in any way to release any partisan version? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Republicans have wide control over what gets released. A partisan memo can spin and cherry pick data points, whereas the full report may undermine the narrative.</p>

<p>Its a classic tactic for people in power. Hype an event to set the narrative before the full story comes out. This creates a basis for confirmation bias, and people will see what they were told to see before being allowed to reach their own conclusions.</p>

<p>You can see this at work in subs like politics or TD. When bombshell reports come out of nowhere there&#39;s always confusion and misalignment. However, if people are prepped beforehand, narrative can be controlled</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh freaking please.  Facebook, Twitter, and all the likes of social media have come out to say their are def bots from outside countries influencing what&#39;s being read.  </p>

<p>There is just WAY too much evidence out there that supports the Russian bot theory, especially when other countries are collaborating it.  Enough with this BS &quot;Cabal&quot; is controlling the world, if a Cabal it is, it&#39;s probably got Russian influence considering how many billions of dollars Putin&#39;s lackey&#39;s control inside and outside of Russia.</p>
