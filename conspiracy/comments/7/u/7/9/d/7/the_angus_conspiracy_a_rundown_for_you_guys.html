        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">65</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2018-01-31 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/XidiusAstral.html">XidiusAstral</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So there was this buger king commercial where the dude asks for an angus burger and the guy at the counter starts lauging and he yells to the other employees like &quot;ayy come over here, this dude wants an ANGUS burger&quot; and they all start mocking him and saying there is no Angus Burger.
Then it cuts to the angus burger and when it cuts back to the burger king employee his smile is gone and he looks terrified like his reality has been shattered.
It then cuts to the burger king employee who&#39;s now in a mental asylum and his hair is torn out in places, his clothes are ripped, his eyes are wide and written all over the walls are the words &quot;angus burger&quot;
They made a follow up advert where the dude is no longer in a mental hospital and is visibly older and has a wife. He&#39;s eating thanksgiving dinner with his family when his daughter comes home and says &quot;Dad, I&#39;d like you to meet my boyfriend Angus&quot;. The man&#39;s eyes widen and he has flashbacks from the Burger King incident. He picks up the turkey knife and stabs Angus through the heart.
It&#39;s hard to even find real footage of it now
the second advert had blood and everything
there was this interview where the burger king CEO was asked about the angus burger advert (this was like 5 years after they stopped airing it) and the guy snatched the camera from the interviewer, slammed it on the floor and walked off.
Burger King spent millions of dollars removing any mention of the angus burger advert from the internet
even 4chan threads about it get taken down
The actor who played &quot;Angus&quot; in the second advert was found dead in his home last year, stab wounds through the chest.
Pyrocynical made an angus burger joke in one of his videos which he later took down, according to reddit he receieved anonymous deathreats and was told to take down the video for his &quot;own good&quot;
Do any of you remember the adverts?</p>
