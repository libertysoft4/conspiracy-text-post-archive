    <div class="md"><p>Copy and pasted from another redditor&#39;s earlier comment:</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think I would hold up Nazi economic policy as anything other than an example of irresponsible government which almost brought Germany to its knees by 1938. It was under Stressman, BEFORE the Nazis, that economic recovery began for Germany. Stressman ended the occupation of the Ruhr, Stressman introduced the Rentemark and Stressman renegotiation the terms of their reparations payments under the Dawes plan. The initial recovery from the post-Versaillies depression, then, can be seen as not being ended by the Nazis at all.</p>

<p>Following Stressman&#39;s death in 1929, there was another economic crisis in Germany, true - but this was not unique to Germany, but rather the result of the global Great Depression and in no way can be seen as condemning the previous economic policy of the Weimar government. If the NSDAP had been in power following the Beer Hall Putsch, the exact same calamity would have befallen them - they are, in this sense, the benefactor of their own incompetence in having failed to come to power earlier. This is all, of course, before we have even gotten into the economic policy of Nazi Germany itself. Under Hitler, the Nazis ran up a deficit of around 35 billion Reichsmarks - a completely unsustainable sum that funded this so called &#39;economic miracle&#39;. The only member of the Nazi administration who could plausibly be called economically competent, Hjalmar Schact, resigned in protest of the utter fiduciary and economic incompetence of Hitler, Göring and Co in their managing of Germany&#39;s economy.</p>

<p>Hitler HIMSELF admitted this in the 1937 Hossbach Memorandum - where he personally saw Nazi Germany in a state of imminent and calamitous economic crisis unless it undertook aggressive military &#39;wars of plunder&#39; to fund it&#39;s massive debt to the very wealthy industrial elite they claimed to have been opposing. By 1939, 17 million people were on state welfare even as the official unemployment rate was at 0% - people were more dependent on the state than ever as the vast-majority of jobs were so lowpaying they had to seek governmental assistance to maintain their basic living standards - a fact often conveniently forgotten by &#39;economic miracle&#39; mythologisers. This is all of course, without even getting into the ethical and moral issues surrounding forced work-camps, rampant nationalisation and the suppression of personal economic freedom that accompanies a state-controlled economy like that of Nazi Germany.</p>

<p>You want to talk about economic miracles? Look at Konrad Adenauer. He was able to do far more than Hitler could possibly dream of while having a fraction of the resources (and country) Hitler did and most importantly, Adenauer DID NOT BRING UNTOLD SUFFERING TO MILLIONS OF PEOPLE.</p>
