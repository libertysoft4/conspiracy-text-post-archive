<p>Who benefits from Joe Public hearing about elites being pedophiles and immediately thinking of the, at best, flimsily supported Comet Ping Pong theory?</p>

<p>Who benefits from legitimate cases of elites/pedophilia all being grouped under the umbrella term &quot;Pizzagate&quot;- a term that immediately brings to mind an unverified conspiracy based on, at best, circumstantial evidence? </p>

<p>Who might desire to conflate legit cases like Presidio, The Finders, Aquino, Franklin Cover-up, with a case so extremely flimsily supported such as Comet Ping Pong? </p>

<p>Would that please anyone? Why? </p>

<p>Would it delight forces backing up cults like The Finders who get their documented child sex abuse dismissed as a &quot;CIA Internal Matter&quot; to have all cases like that wear a Pizza label and be associated with ranting youtube videos and 4chan evidence?</p>

<p>I think it would. I think they would be even extremely motivated to see that happen. </p>

<p>Some of you are likely extremely emotionally invested in this topic. All I&#39;m asking is that you ask yourself who benefits from lumping proven cases of elite pedophilia with an unproven one that is roundly mocked and dismissed by the populace. Ask yourself that without emotion. </p>

<p>So, below is a list of some of the COINTELPRO victims. Feel free to look up their stories if you actually care to know. Many of them have written about their experiences, including John Lewis, Angela Davis, MLK (before he was killed), MLK&#39;s family, members of the Black Panthers, etc. I should also note that the idea that &quot;they spread stories like this to put fear into people&quot; doesn&#39;t hold water since the original COINTELPRO documents were only made public after a group of activists broke into an FBI field office, discovered the documents, and sent them to newspapers. </p>

<p>It is amazing how quickly these fanciful tales of &#39;cointelpro&#39; melt like ice cubes in the sun when those parroting the stories are asked for evidence.</p>

<p>Maybe the stories of &#39;cointelpro&#39; are themselves the psyop. Most people get scared, and that is all it takes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>lol, I literally gave you not only the direct source documents from the FBI, but independent journalism on the subject and the names of people who have written and spoken about their experiences.  </p>

<p>I guess if you think the cointelpro was a psy-op . . . OK, but there&#39;s zero evidence for that, while there is direct, documented evidence, confirmed by the very agency that performed the operations, that COINTELPRO existed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t. Like I said above, the documents were only released because activists broke into a field office and found them. So the theory you&#39;re proposing would require that the FBI faked investigations of hundreds of people and groups, created dated documents with conversations, notes, addresses, etc. for each file, while . . . what? secretly hoping that someone would break into a random field office, find the documents, and give them to newspapers?  </p>

<p>Is that possible--of course. Is there any evidence for it? No. While there is plenty of evidence that the FBI actually conducted COINTELPRO investigations, including their own secret documents, investigation by Congress into the program, and apologies by people in charge.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s odd to me that you ask for evidence, which I provide, and you &quot;refute&quot; that evidence with a theory that has no evidence to support it whatsoever. </p>

<p>I do think a lot of alt-righters went ballistic over &quot;Pizzagate&quot; for purely political reasons and that they didn&#39;t give a shit at all when there were documented cases of CIA cults protecting child sex traffickers. Partisan hackery. </p>

<p>Trump wasn&#39;t the first to say &quot;Fake News,&quot; but he certainly popularized it. </p>

<p>Why are alt-right, pepe-lovers, who scream &quot;Fake News,&quot; at anything that goes against their narrative so obsessed with Pizzagate? More troubling, and what I&#39;m getting at here, is, why are they now conflating actual substantiated cases of child sex abuse under an umbrella term involving a Pizzeria sex-ring that they couldn&#39;t substantiate. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay it&#39;s quite simple. Pizzagate came about on Reddit and 4chan with there evidence through the Podesta emails which the initial comet ping pong pizza theory thread was opened on 4 November 2016. A week later the first post I could find of &quot;Fake News&quot; the media (here)[<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2016/11/11/mark-zuckerberg-denies-that-fake-news-on-facebook-influenced-the-elections/?utm_term=.ee0e3e9c187a">https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2016/11/11/mark-zuckerberg-denies-that-fake-news-on-facebook-influenced-the-elections/?utm_term=.ee0e3e9c187a</a>]. Meanwhile the term Alt-Right becomes used to describe anyone who believes the theory which was never used before creating the sub concioussness link between Pizzagate and Alt-Right and conspiracy theories and &quot;crazy&quot; people. </p>

<p>Then on November 23rd the subreddit is banned completely and Fake News and Alt-Right take off.</p>

<p>There is clearly a correlation there between the 3 terms which peaked at exactly the same time.</p>

<p>What about the AP citing Spencer promoting it in 2010 though? </p>

<p>And thank you for laying it out there. </p>

<p>I think your angle is that Pizzagate is real and &quot;they&#39;re&quot; trying to discredit it by labeling its proponents Nazis. </p>

<p>I&#39;d disagree and say that a lot of Pizzagaters are primarily partisan motivated, as I was posting about The Finders on my website and there wasn&#39;t a bunch of Anons foaming at the mouth about it. They didn&#39;t care at all, actually. </p>

<p>Many alt-righters identify as &quot;alt-right,&quot; so they&#39;re not being labelled as their counterparts on the left are- I&#39;ve never heard a member of any leftist group describe themselves as &quot;alt-left&quot; but they have been labelled that. Distinct difference. </p>

<p>All that aside, I think we could probably agree that lumping confirmed cases of spooks trafficking kids with a highly dubious one under the umbrella term &quot;Pizzagate&quot; would be a goal of, say, the spooks who protected The Finders. </p>

<p>I also posted about The Finders on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. Normal conspiracy theorists cared. The Pizzagate crowd didn&#39;t care and I believe that&#39;s due to the mobilization of the alt-right and them being heavily partisan-motivated. </p>

<p>The pizzagaters are discrediting other rings by now claiming, in their words, &quot;They&#39;re part of Pizzagate.&quot; They&#39;re saying this about cases that are decades-old. Not only are they not &quot;connected rings&quot; they have nothing at all to do with Pizzagate and are being damaged severely by the actions of these &quot;Researchers.&quot; I&#39;m sure some are unaware they&#39;re aiding in the enemy in conflating real cases with their unproven one, but I suspect some of this is by design. </p>

<p>Either way it needs to stop. The Franklin Scandal happened in 1988. It is in no way &quot;part of Pizzagate.&quot; Getting Joe Public to believe that detracts from its legitimacy.  </p>

<p>In my personal opinion, the greatest verification that there actually <em>is</em> something to the findings of the pizzagate investigations is the reaction from the establishment. Right around the time pizzagate was breaking on this sub, you start to see the term “fake news” pop up everywhere. And then you have this guy who supposedly goes to Comet Ping Pong and fire a gun off because he believes pizzagate.

    <div class="md"><p>I’m not concerned with your opinion about my beliefs in the slightest. And I don’t really want to look at your post history. If you spend your free time trying to debunk pizzagate, which is a dumb name given to Ritual Satanic Child Sex Abuse, then maybe there is something wrong with you. Like, why are you so concerned about proving to everyone that there is nothing to it? Why does it mean so much to you to discredit an investigation that could lead to saving the lives of children? Think about that for a second.</p>

<p>Nothing you say will make me agree with you on this. The Finders Cult, The Franklin Coverup, Marc Dutroux, Jimmy Saville; all of these cases give <em>more</em> credibility to the pizzagate theories. Your argument is inherently flawed. How would it benefit the perpetrators of previously proven crimes to bring attention to themselves with pizzagate? I mean, is your theory that the real offenders created pizzagate as a means to discredit other cases of child sex abuse? Cause that’s a pretty flimsy argument too. And seeing as the MSM is the mouthpiece for the intelligence agencies, the response to pizzagate by the MSM was actually pretty telling. They didn’t ask any questions pertaining to the actual content of the emails that started the whole investigation. From the getgo it was labeled “fake news” and a “wild conspiracy”. John Podesta and James Alefantis both went on major news networks to play the victims. The MSM has the opportunity to ask them the hard questions, and they chose not to. Does that not seem a bit strange to you? And while all this is happening you suddenly start to hear Fake News everywhere, and the Dems start crying “it was the Russians”. But then again, you probably believe that the Russians hacked our election or colluded with the Trump campaign...</p>

<p>any excuses to avoid it are basically acts of putting your head in the sand.  we&#39;re being given a chance to self-direct.  and we can take it or we can give it up (and we know where that leads.  complete servitude).  so it&#39;s not really a hard choice, but for some reason many people are too weak to take that chance.  it&#39;s really just a choice.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yeah i&#39;m not saying don&#39;t apply critical thought to the information and try to come up with a model.  i suggest people do that.  </p>

<p>my concern wrt pizzagate (and i guess this applies to all the other bad incidents too) is that there&#39;s a risk of rationalizing it away.  that i think is a bad idea.  i think pizzagate on its own, regardless if it&#39;s a setup, needs to be investigated.  there are underground facilities that people likely know the locations of and for some reason those things aren&#39;t being investigated.  all the chitchat trying to avoid dealing with it buys time for these people to shut it down.  the stuff needs to be investigated.  that it&#39;s not being investigated tells you right off the bat that it&#39;s a systemic issue - meaning that it goes right to the heart of power, and that would make sense given some of the MK Ultra disclosures, amongst other things.  it&#39;s a question about the very system and how it&#39;s enabling absurdly abusive acts.  they&#39;re caught out.  now is the time to investigate.  even if it&#39;s people on their own getting together and watching places or digging up their own information about suspected locations and getting intel (license plates, etc) on who is going in and out of those places - that&#39;s better than fucking sitting around doing sweet fuck all.  the gov is unable to fix itself and to fix this problem because to do so would expose how fucked it really is.  so the people have to do their own legwork here.  it ain&#39;t gonna happen otherwise.  we haven&#39;t seen shit happen under trump with regards to those hawaii locations.  we already know it&#39;s a spin.  there should be people investigating it.  there&#39;s no real other excuse.</p>

<p>did you not follow the hawaii stuff?  that&#39;s pretty fucking clear there&#39;s something super sketchy going on there.  and the comet pingpong location..also clear there was probably stuff going on.  so if the estab ain&#39;t gonna do it people have to do it.  or it ain&#39;t gonna happen.  again i&#39;m just suggesting getting more data.  no illegal activities.  no vigilante shit.  just learn more.  step 1.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i dunno..depends what the data shows.  for instance let&#39;s say you identify a place and then keep it under video surveillance.   you get a picture of the bus driver and name of the company he&#39;s under.  you can chase that down.  maybe you find out it&#39;s associated with some sketchy group.  you post that.  the point is to build up more information so that you can know if you&#39;re on the right track or not.  you can&#39;t do it without information.  you need to get that first.  and let&#39;s say in your surveillance you get some kids faces.  maybe those kids are already missing and you&#39;ve found them.  who the fuck knows.  who knows what the data will show.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have you tagged as posting, &quot;The Finders is part of Pizzagate.&quot; </p>

<p>I&#39;m asking you to really consider what promoting that statement is doing. The CIA got The FInders case dismissed as it was a &quot;CIA internal matter.&quot; I think we can all agree that the CIA would love the average American to think that all documented child sex rings they sponsor are just, &quot;Part of that pizzagate thing,&quot; where people strung together a bunch of circumstantial evidence, couldn&#39;t come up with anything concrete, referenced 4chan as sources, and some dingbat shot up a pizzeria- for no good reason at all. </p>

<p>Wouldn&#39;t it delight real sex traffickers to have their cases grouped under The Pizzagate umbrella as you&#39;re doing? Why are you doing that? Are you unaware of who is benefiting from it or is there something else going on?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What is going on is you do not understand what is going on.   Perhaps your definition of Pizzagate is not accurate.   Do you prefer to call it Pedogate?   </p>

<p>The CIA is the largest human trafficker there is.   Same with drugs and organs.   </p>

<p>Your position is based on the assumption that Pizzagate is not real.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pizzagate has circumstantial evidence. No solid proof. Two days ago, people upvoted statements like &quot;The Finders is part of Pizzagate&quot; into the 30s.</p>

<p>People responsible for getting The Finders case dismissed as a CIA internal matter, would be thrilled if it started to be associated with, even better called by the name of, a case that doesn&#39;t have any actual evidence. </p>

<p>What if the CIA could get everyone to associate cases like The Franklin Cover-up or the Presidio with 4chan sources, ranting youtube videos, &quot;codewords&quot; there was never any evidence for, and the general lack of actual evidence that is Pizzagate. </p>

<p>Maybe they&#39;d even try to get people to start saying &quot;The Finders is part of Pizzagate.&quot; </p>

<p>It would certainly delight them. Think about it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pizzagate is the most easy to see through conspiracy of all time. The theory was launched on zero credible evidence, created and pushed by Trump fans, disparages Democrats, homosexuals, and Clinton by association, draws even more attention to buttery males, and was launched just a week or two before the elections.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I more or less agree with what you&#39;re saying here. It fits a common pattern of the arbiters of &quot;mainstream/conventional wisdom&quot; conflating legitimate, solidly evidenced conspiracy theories with much less credible ones, with the result of discrediting any and all conspiracy theorizing. I&#39;ve often wondered the same thing about stuff like flat-Earth or the whole &quot;Elites are LITERALLY lizards who eat babies&quot; type stuff. I think a lot of stuff is deliberately injected into the culture so that any time the average person hears about a conspiracy theory, their knee-jerk reaction is to laugh it off as crazy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s what&#39;s happening, precisely. There were several proponents of Pizzagate who replied to me yesterday with statements like, &quot;The Finders is part of Pizzagate.&quot; They had over a dozen upvotes where my insisting that it wasn&#39;t was in the negatives. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if they&#39;re aware of what they&#39;re doing, but it&#39;s not good. </p>

<p>I mod <a href="/r/psychotronics">/r/psychotronics</a> with a prolific mind control researcher that goes by Omnisense. Omnisense was contacted by other established conspiracy researchers who had received emails from someone claiming &quot;to represent a group of wealthy businessmen&quot; who were interested in financially compensating the owners of conspiracy websites to start promoting flat-earth. </p>

<p>It&#39;s the same game but with different pieces. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Spot on. Pizzagate is a perfect way to discredit serious research into actual pedo rings that have good evidence to support them. For example, the Franklin Scandal, the Johnny Gosch abduction, the Family, the Finders, etc., etc.  </p>

<p>Now that pizzagate is so well in the public conscious as the absurd thing that it is, the powers that be will be able to dismiss all serious investigations into real pedo rings as &quot;just like pizzagate.&quot;  </p>

<p>It&#39;s brilliant propaganda, really. I don&#39;t even blame them for doing it really. I blame the people who fall for it and become useful, unpaid, idiots for the powers that be. </p>

<p>i&#39;ll give an example.  the other day i&#39;m walking thru the neighbourhood and i see a spot that has a fuckton of the masonic pedo symbols.  so i make a post about it talking about the symbols to look out for.  the very next day there&#39;s graffiti on the place. 666 shit like that.  so people had obviously read my post and decided they&#39;d preemptively do property damage (why i dunno.  maybe to then accuse me of leading them to do it).  but it was weird.  and i walk past that place today and i see a school bus outside honking away.  it&#39;s a daycare centre.  the windows are all blacked out.  wtf right?  and he was honking like no tomorrow.  if there are kids there that&#39;s kinda weird.  it was just weird.  and there&#39;s a nearby masonic temple.  i notice they&#39;re suddenly doing sewer work right in the middle of the road where you might have a tunnel from the temple to the centre.  just weird shit like that.  i reckon these people who are doing that stuff are watching all of these posts and trying to cover up their shit asap right fucking now.  so our time is limited.  that is what it seems like to me. </p>
