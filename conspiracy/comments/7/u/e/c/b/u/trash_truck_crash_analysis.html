        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>If you didnt catch it, here&#39;s what happened.</p>

<p><a href="https://boingboing.net/2018/01/31/gop-train-crashes-trash-truck.html/amp#ampshare=https://boingboing.net/2018/01/31/gop-train-crashes-trash-truck.html">https://boingboing.net/2018/01/31/gop-train-crashes-trash-truck.html/amp#ampshare=https://boingboing.net/2018/01/31/gop-train-crashes-trash-truck.html</a></p>

<p>Either the trash truck parked accidentally on the train tracks or the trash truck was intentionally put there. </p>

<p>For now let&#39;s assume the latter because this kind of thing rarely happens, the fact that it happened to a train full of GOP lawmakers makes it being an accident highly improbable.The fact that it occurred one day after SOTU makes it even less likely to be an accident.</p>

<p>Remember when they said the hawaii nuke warning was a dude who pushed the wrong button? Well, they changed their message. They have been doing this a lot in recent weeks.</p>

<p>Remember the Washington state train crash a few months ago that killed many? Also amtrak. Anybody who has ridden on an amtrak train knows just how shady Amtrak is. </p>

<p>I know its subjective opinion but I was on an amtrak train from Chicago to Cleveland before and the train seemed to be full of children without their parents, amish groups wearing amish cult clothes (bonnets n beards), and skechy looking ghetto dudes. It was really weird, but it was end of summer so I assumed all the kids were from divorced families and were going back to live with their other parent during the school year, but it seemed weird. Now that pizzagate and deep state human trafficking seems to be real, it&#39;s made me look at amtrak anew. Is amtrak the go-to human trafficking transportation platform in the US? </p>

<p>Here are some theories of what really happened during the trash truck crash.</p>

<p>&#39;black hats did it&#39; scenarios:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>this was intended to kill congessmen but didnt go as planned. There is motive and past precedent (WA state crash caused by driver going too fast)</p></li>
<li><p>This was intended as a threat message meant to influence GOP decisions on the FISA memo and exposing the deep state. If deep state really wanted to kill GOP congressmen they would have done what they normally do, make it look like it was terrorists. Maybe this &#39;murder by suicide&#39; (Barry Sherman and wife) and &#39;accident&#39; (Hawaii missile, amtrak crash) is their new strategy.</p></li>
<li><p>Trump is actually black hat and uses events like this to scare and control congress into passin g legislature he wants. The only reason I mention this theory is because of the CNN mar a lago white van incident. If you didnt hear, there was a mysterious white van blocking CNN&#39;s favorite eavesdropping spot while trump plays golf with officials. CNN tried to turn this white van into a conspiracy plot. it got more CNN coverage in a week than Haiti has gotten in the last 5 years, but actually it was a strategically parked white van blocking CNN from spying. Not a real strong connection, but ya know both would be strategic truck parks.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>&#39;white hat did it&#39; scenarios:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Was intended to bring media attention on what these GOP congressmen were actually doing on this &#39;retreat&#39; in West Virginia. Seemed kind of weird for them all to be taking an amtrak there in the first place.</p></li>
<li><p>Was used to send a message to congress that the infrastructure needs to be updated. Trump is pushing the infrastructure plan in congress. after the WA train crash, trump tweeted that it shows infrastructure needs to be updated.</p></li>
<li><p>There was a legal reason for it. In times of emergency that executive branch of govt can take extra measures to arrest and detain people. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>the fact that an accident occurred is not the issue, its the timing and context.</p>

<p>The next few days should be telling. if MSM drops the story and/or never talks about the story of the driver who died then this fits the false flag pattern.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the list i provided was for passenger trains. the accident in question was a passenger train, as such it is much more statistically significant than using freight trains.</p>

<p>the link you gave includes freight trains. freight trains make up almost all of US train traffic. Using freight train accident rates to represent passenger train accident rates in this context would be RETARDED on so many levels.</p>

<p>My observation was more that it was a weird group of people. Lots of children running around doing teenager stuff, ghetto gangsters, and groups of amish people.</p>

<p>For the amish, taking the train makes sense as they were not allowed to take cars or planes at the time.  I heard a year ago or so the amish started to be allowed to take airplanes officially for the first time.</p>

<p>these tweets are more than you think. its not simple on what happened either.</p>

<p>My guess is that they were going ro greenbriar to see for themselves just how deep and far ahead these black projects are. It was a warning shot not to dig too deep. The black world is like a whole other world with advanced technologies, operating entirely outside of the constition. siphoning trillions of dollars to further fund these projects.</p>

<p>Thats the real conspiracy. Everything else is just leadup.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wonder how these elected officials live. Did Pelosi tweet that after taking her own kitchen trash out? Or maybe scrubbing one of the bathrooms. They live in an elitist world and are not of the people for the people by the people. Contrived response is what makes us all suspect that they don’t give a damn about us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>apparently the train never braked or slowed before hitting the truck.</p>

<p>this means two possibilities:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>the train driver didnt see the truck because it got there last minute</p></li>
<li><p>The train driver was involved in the plot</p></li>

In a tweet, Russia&#39;s embassy in Washington acknowledged the visit, Sergey Naryshkin has visited the United States for consultations with #US counterparts on the struggle against terrorism.</p>

<p>Trump spoke about creating a more united country during a lunch with a number of television news anchors. 
Without a major event where people pull together, that’s hard to do. But I would like to do it without that major event because usually that major event is not a good thing.”</p>

<p>Train carrying GOP lawmakers crashes with trash truck, killing one and injuring others.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>there&#39;s def a lot of message inside a message stuff going on recently. Pelosi seems too retarded for complex language, but maybe she has some one who helps her.</p>
