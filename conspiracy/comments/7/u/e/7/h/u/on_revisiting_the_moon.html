        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I was talking to some peers and none of them even knew we (USA) supposedly landed on the moon with manned operations <strong>6</strong> times.  They all thought it was once, one of them thought twice.  (Out of 6)</p>

<p>Hmm.  That piqued my interest.</p>

<p>Of course my follow up is why havent any other countries done it if USA nailed it 6 times over 2 generations ago.  Or even how come 6 times in a relatively short period for USA, and never again?</p>

<p>We get two cookie cut answers which surely <em>may</em> apply:</p>

<p>1) Its a ball of uninhabitable matter (the guy used &quot;ball of dust&quot; (i think rock/dirt may fit better but whatever.  Theres also &quot;officially&quot; supposedly water)<br/>
2) Its a cash/funding problem.  </p>

<p>Nothing there on the moon, eh?  Funding problem? (Perhaps by design...)</p>

<p>Or maybe it&#39;s because they dont want 7 billion people (or any percentage of them) banding together to get off this corrupt shit hole of a planet filled with thieves, liars and immoral capitalists  (edit: and other ideologies, thanks Mr. Grump) milking the planet and  residents for more money and power, slowly destroying our potential to live here long term via pollution, radiation, explosions/bombs, scorched earth, depleted soil, pharmaceuticals making their way into our oceans and countless others.  </p>

<p>It would make for less slaves on this planet, right?  But hey lets just remain ignorant of the possibilities. (One of my peers claimed that it wouldnt affect him if we somehow proved it was fabricated.  Another claimed shit(myth)busters completely debunked all considerations)</p>

<hr/>

<p>Personally, it makes a whole lot of sense there would be a lunar base funded and operated by black projects, operating chiefly robotically, especially in 2018.  This project most probably began shortly after the &quot;Space Race&quot; movies/propaganda.  &quot;Look all, nothing to see here but us playing golf on a barren, utterly useless landscape.  Oh we also brought a buggy and drove a few miles and it was the same!&quot;  ... </p>

<p>Nope! No need to figure out a lunar base which has a tiny gravitional well compared to earth and literally zero atmospheric drag: the two chief &quot;geographical&quot; issues we face when designing a space ship capable of leaving the surface of earth.  Lets directly go to Mars and skip all that!  </p>

<p>I call bullshit.  My peers didnt like it very much.  I expected that, but figured I&#39;d dump the experience and fish for viewpoints in the year 2018.</p>

<p>Capitalism <em>can</em> be fine until disrupted by immorality and greed.  You dont even need to be an old man to come to this obvious conclusion (not saying youre old, youre acting like you are in high school or college.). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s what I was hoping for my peers to at least consider.  </p>

<p>Given a group of six, I was dealing with the momentum of the herd.  But I noticed one of the ones I respect most for his intelligence, looking up things on his computer, and seemingly more engaged (listening, moving seat closer to the group) as the conversation went.  Although he didnt contribute to the conversation much.  </p>

<p>That&#39;s still indicative I got at least one of them possibly challenging their belief instead of dismissing valid concerns. (Our conversation was quite long and spanned many topics, for instance the &quot;missing&quot; Apollo telemetry tapes, possible CGI tells in modern launches and ISS and more)</p>
