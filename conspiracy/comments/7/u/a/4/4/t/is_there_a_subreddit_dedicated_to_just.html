<p>Citing what is basically a journal that&#39;ll publish any given nonsense, isn&#39;t the most persuasive approach.</p>

<p>The journal promotes individual academic freedom and will consider all work without regard to affiliations. For this reason, the articles published in Progress in Physics may not necessarily represent the scientific views of the Editorial Board or its individual members. All submissions will be forwarded to invited experts, whose professional field is close to the submission. Decision about the submission will be produced by the Editors, according to the recommendations obtained from the side of the reviewers.</p>

<p>The referees of the papers published are not listed, although anonymity of referees is specifically criticized in &quot;Article 8: Freedom to publish scientific results&quot; of the Declaration of Academic Freedom.[1] This document harshly criticizes the current peer-review system using the words &quot;censorship&quot;, &quot;alleged expert referees&quot;, &quot;blacklisting&quot;, and &quot;bribes&quot;.</p>

<p>The journal has published papers by several authors, who, along with some of the editors, claim to have been blacklisted by the Cornell University arXiv as proponents of fringe scientific theories.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Spectrum are Plane Waves - not longitudinal waves. Longitudinal waves are time variable. Light Spectrum is emitted in the same fashion as your monitor, emitting a single frame let&#39;s say in terms of Hertz. Let&#39;s say 60 frames per second. However, each frame is emitted independent of every other frame. Spectral Image is independent of every spectrum emitted before and after. Just like the images of a TV show, each frame is unique and not dependent on the previous frame. Spectrum is time-independent and does not rely on any stretch of time to be observed. </p>

<p>This fact alone renders the Doppler Redshift Cosmology as nothing more than a desperate fraud to save Creationism that any 6th grade chemistry student can quickly realize. The Chemical Spectrum of any Element - terrestrial or astronomical in origin is completely independent of the length of observation, because --- like your monitor soectral data is transmitted as INSTANTANEOUS PLANE WAVES unique to every moment of emission. </p>

<p>The very concept of Spectral Doppler Redshift is total nonsense. </p>

<p>If you wish to continue, your light bulb emits light - not in a continuous analog fashion, but in a rapid digital fashion - Light is DIGITAL </p>

<p>Doppler is a temporal ANALOG phenomenon.
Spectrum is a discrete digital phenomonon.</p>

<p>Doppler Redshift Cosmology is an obvious Creationist fraud created for a naive and gullible JudeoChristian audience.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i’ll do that. but re reading what you wrote, i think you’re confused about wave particle duality. yes you treat each pixel as a frame that emits a light “spectrum”, i put spectrum in quotes because it’s not a spectrum, it’s a certain frequency that a diode emits because the atomic states were exited then released that excess energy at a very specific frequency creating a specific color. </p>

<p>so just because light is time independent does not mean  the space it travels from your monitor to your face is constant. what if the monitor is in a vacuum? what if your monitor is accelerating away from you? if you’re interpreting optical physics in your own way, be my guest. but you’ll need to have a better argument than that</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bullshit.</p>

<p>Any light emitted doesn&#39;t just sit there and stream a continuum. Light is emitted at a frequency. Take for example your computer monitor, it emits light in terms of frames per second in an oscillatory on/off fashion. If your monitor flicked on / off and produces 100 fps, then you have produced 100 images. If you are observing spectrum, the spectral emissions of a helium atom, then it is oscillating at its own frequency and in one second it will produce X number of frames.</p>

<p>The number of frames emitted are instantaneous plane wave photon packets. If it emitted 100 frames, then it produced 100 spectral image datasets. </p>

<p>Doppler has fuck all to do with it.</p>
