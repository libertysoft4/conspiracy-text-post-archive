        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The Theory of Gravity.</p>

<p>Lets dissect this theory, shall we?</p>

<p>First, I ask for evidence that mass attracts mass.</p>

<p>Oops! It does not exist.</p>

<p>There is no real experiment to prove that mass attracts mass.</p>

<p>Thats why it is called the <em>theory</em> of gravity.</p>

<p>Now, I am sure there are people reading this just screaming in their heads, but things fall!</p>

<p>Yes, but its just due to density.</p>

<p>A microphone will drop because it is more dense than the air around it.</p>

<p>A balloon will float up because it is less dense than the air around it.</p>

<p>A rock will sink in water because it is more dense than water.</p>

<p>A chunk of wood will float up in water because it is less dense than water.</p>

<p>That is measurable, observable and repeatable. <em>That</em> is science.</p>

<p>But saying that things fall because there is a force pulling them down to Earth is not provable.</p>

<p>The Cavendish experiment allegedly shows gravitational forces at work.</p>

<p>It is basically a rod suspended from a string with weights on either end.</p>

<p>Then, more weights are placed near the suspended ones, and all the weights are supposed to touch.</p>

<p>Presumably due to gravity.</p>

<p>Now, in most videos I have seen displaying the Cavendish experiment, every person had a lot of trouble getting the suspended rod in the middle to stay put. It was always moving, even without the extra weights that are placed near the suspended ones.</p>

<p>So is gravity really at work?</p>

<p>Does this experiment really prove anything?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.school-for-champions.com/science/gravitation_cavendish_experiment.htm#.WnCfhZM-eRs">Here is a link</a> to an article explaining the experiment and a quote from the link below</p>

<p>&quot;The setup consisted of a torsion balance to attract lead balls together, measuring the torque on a wire and then equating it to the gravitational force between the balls. Then by a complex derivation, G = 2π2LθRe2/T2M was determined.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pSkz4zmcpY">Here is a link</a> to a video allegedly displaying the force of gravity.</p>

<p>Now if this is gravity at work, is it counteracting Earths supposedly massive gravitational pull?</p>

<p>Why is the gravity from Earth not simply keeping the weights where they are, as the pull downwards should be much greater than the pull left or right, should it not?</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11sLusnVZwM">Here is a link</a> to another video attempting to re create the cavendish experiment.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ym6nlwvQZnE">Here is a link</a> to a much older video displaying the cavendish and other experiments</p>

<p>If this experiment is so easy, why is it that I have only heard about it after my own research?</p>

<p>Why is this experiment not shown in every school?</p>

<p>There are too many variables at play, in my opinion, and it is not reliably repeatable, that&#39;s why.</p>

<p>Experiments aside, I have questions about how science views gravity in general.</p>

<p>If Earths gravity is strong enough to hold millions of gallons of ocean water to the sea floor, then how can a little sparrow fly high over the oceans?</p>

<p>How does gravity even effect water?</p>

<p>Why do they say the Moon is held in by Earths gravity, but the Moon is strong enough to pull on Earths oceans?</p>

<p>Gravity is not holding the universe together.</p>

<p>It is just a lie.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am a fan of the theory that rotational velocity does indeed have an effect on the surrounding space time in such a way that there is an effect created. Theoretically with enough velocity, and a large enough &#39;object&#39; there would be a vortex like distortion where the outside edges of say a spiral galaxy would, even at the speed of light, &#39;lag&#39; relative to the rotation at the galaxies core, placing a stress or stretch on the very fabric of space time... And you could theorise that the pull inward is due to a literal sort of buoyancy or density difference in the fabric of space time itself along this plane of rotation... Just some thoughts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yeah.  if you model out a thing accelerating in a circle you get a component vector that&#39;s radial, orthogonal to the motion itself.  so right off the bat you have, with rotation, the characteristic of creating forces that are at right angles to each other.  then if you look at empirical work like the stuff john hutchinson was doing, he demonstrated that the interactions between rotating mag fields that intersect (btw, i think this is the fundamental design underlying physics) you get levitation amongst other things (ie. forces orthogonal to the fields).  and similarly if you look at conservation of momentum (including angular momentum) you see that it enables things like gyroscopes which seem to also not obey what we&#39;d traditionally think of as newtonian laws.  and this is because as you tilt a spinning thing and you restrict its degree of motion on one axis, it will start to spin in an orthogonal axis.  this is very fundamental, imo, to the actual model of everything.  you have spinning frames that are intersected with other spinning frames, such that the axis of rotation of the second thing goes thru the centre of rotation of the first thing.  and in terms of things like time travel.  if you restrict degrees of freedom in all 3d dimensions with a thing with high angular momentum (and i think you can do this with magnetic and electric fields) you would theoretically create movement along an axis orthogonal to those 3 dimensions - in other words, time.  which lends to the idea that timespace is a mutable hypercube.  which i think it is.</p>

<p>but then you are expected to take that and believe it holds water to a ball. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>That ball would need sufficient mass, and you&#39;d need enough water. You&#39;d also need to counteract any overwhelming gravitational fields in the vicinity, so this doesn&#39;t work on planetary surfaces since both the ball and the water will be pulled far harder into the planet than into each other.</p>

<p>This is also more complicated because gravity is not a strong force compared to the other three. If you took a golf ball and some water droplets outside the ISS, they&#39;d stick together, but that&#39;s intermolecular forces, which is much stronger than gravity at that scale. For gravity to be significant we&#39;re talking about lakes and moons really, like what you see on Titan, not golf balls and droplets.</p>

<p>You also need to be aware of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roche_limit">Roche Limit</a> at this point. This is essentially explained the same way as the explanation why you can&#39;t be on a planetary surface. If you get too close, the whole thing gets torn apart into rings.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Or holds planets in perfect synchronous motion for millennia.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Our solar system is estimated at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_System">4.6 billion</a> years old, so millennia is a very short timescale. That said, orbits are not <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stability_of_the_Solar_System">predictable over the long term</a> because small gravitational perturbations and are chaotic in nature.</p>

<p>The consistency of the planets with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invariable_plane">invariable plane</a> of the Solar system (the orbits are nearly concentric), as well as the consistent rotational direction is not a gravitational effect. Rather, it&#39;s because the nebula that collapses and eventually formed the Solar system <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_and_evolution_of_the_Solar_System">was spinning</a>, so conservation of angular momentum kept things relatively in line and spinning the same direction.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Or allows planes to fly level all around a ball without adjusting their trajectory.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They do adjust their trajectory. This is based on the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attitude_indicator">artificial horizon</a> in the cockpit. That instrument is one of the most important for any pilot and uses gyros and a bit of other mechanical fancy to tell the pilot where his nose is pointing with respect to the horizon. This requires down on the instrument always being the direction of gravitation, which means that this instrument is key to the adjustment.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t really noticeable on long haul flights because planes are not moving anywhere near fast enough for this to cause much of an acceleration. Rest assured though, if this adjustment was not made, gravity would slowly pull everything towards the back of the plane until the plane eventually reaches too high an altitude and stalls. Obviously this is an undesired event for any pilot.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>a much more simple explanation exists</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This doesn&#39;t mean the alternative is true though.</p>

<p>One suggestion I have for you is that if you&#39;re attempting to convince other people of something, you have to be willing to meet them at their level.

<p>The sun is also the nucleus of another atom, obviously in a &quot;higher level&quot; we just see it differently from our perspective but it&#39;s probably a huge atom, and planets are &quot;electrons&quot;. Higher level sun&#39;s have more planets is what I&#39;m guessing. And finally. </p>

<p>We are probably atoms who decided to experience life, from the perspective of humans( still working on this theory), the &quot;chakras&quot;  are energy balls &quot;electrons&quot; and as we grow in conciousness, our &quot;selves(atom/Adam)&quot; gains electrons and so we &quot;unlock/open chakras&quot;.

    <div class="md"><p>I think he chose a bad fixed camera position, he could&#39;ve drove a bit further from East through West.</p>

<p>Clearly it&#39;s a <a href="https://www.metabunk.org/attachments/20170722-185524-apvma-jpg.27881/">very distorted picture</a></p>

<p>They should take a <a href="https://www.metabunk.org/data/MetaMirrorCache/a4fa1f9c4a4746d90e7e23020700768f.png">pic and video</a> with the building clear in the background,  and better equipment with MUCH better zoom.</p>

<p>Most of the curvature becomes apparent at <a href="https://www.metabunk.org/data/MetaMirrorCache/d3024eed228cdb781223b0c872643aaf.jpg">the end of the horizon.</a></p>

<p>The direct video that you linked seems a bit dishonest to me. And I tell you why</p>

<p>The video starts of with the &#39;globe shill&#39; picture that is cropped and already far far zoomed in on the horizon. Because it&#39;s cropped it seems like it starts from the car.</p>

<p>Just where the &#39;flat earth&#39; shill&#39; starts his video at that point in the video, which is completely zoomed out. </p>

<p>For the viewer it&#39;s like both were started from the same perspective. </p>

<p>Except he never even reaches the zoom and  level of resolution.</p>

<p>Pause the video at <a href="https://www.metabunk.org/attachments/20170722-185524-apvma-jpg.27881/">2:13</a> It is after that endpoint where he should zoom in. Compare 2:13 and the pictures for yourself, you&#39;ll see it because of the towering building.</p>

<p>It is MUCH MUCH farther away by the way then it looks 
.  That is the furthest he could zoom..much farther after that point you would <a href="https://www.metabunk.org/data/MetaMirrorCache/d3024eed228cdb781223b0c872643aaf.jpg">clearly see the curvature</a> and rule out any distortion.</p>

<p>In the end of the video he is playing with perspective again and comparing it with their blurry flat pic. </p>

<p>And you&#39;re right, your second video proves the Earth is flat. </p>

<p>But this video proves Earth isn&#39;t flat. They need to bring better equipment.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Drag. Space isn&#39;t a perfect vacuum, there&#39;s still air. For a satellite to stay in orbit it has to be going fast enough horizontally to &quot;miss&quot; the earth (that&#39;s an over simplification of orbits but works enough for this).

<p>The more the satellite slows down the lower it sinks into denser air and the more it&#39;s slowed down. There&#39;s not a lot of air but satellites are big and moving at pretty damn fast so it&#39;s smashing through a lot of air and over time that&#39;s enough </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If density is what pulled things to earth then their acceleration would be dependent on their density vs the density of environment they are &quot;falling&quot; in. In a vacuum, things fall at the same rate. This shows that density does not dictate the rate at which things fall.

If you drop a bowling ball and a baseball, different densities, they would fall at the same rate.</p>

<p>Err non-vacuums will produce drag. If you used a regular size bowling ball and a regular sized baseball and then dropped them, you&#39;d see a (very slight) difference in fall rate, just because of their size and shape difference. </p>

<p>You assume there exists only 1 flat earth model (dome). This is not a valid assumption, although it is the most popular model out there, it is not the only one. For example: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcp0sSa_Ewc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcp0sSa_Ewc</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah yes forgive me, I forgot about the &quot;two giant spacetime portals&quot; option. Occam&#39;s razor be damned. </p>

<p>The model still doesn&#39;t work though since viewing angles of stars (if they worked like this) wouldn&#39;t match with reality. </p>

<p>Also I just want to point out a mistake this guy made about the Sphere model. He stated that the celestial equator should follow an individual from latitude to latitude if we were living on a sphere. This is false. An observer would be tilted by an angle equal to whatever latitude they were at. This would change the apparent position of the celestial equator. What he disproved was whether or not Earth was a cylinder. I mean for gods sake, he pulls away at 6:20 and reveals that we were looking at things from the inside of a cylinder, not the surface of a sphere. </p>

<p>So you&#39;re saying, on a <em>tilted</em>, spinning globe model, everyone, from all latitudes, would observe the same celestial equator, as we do in reality? Silly question perhaps: isn&#39;t that impossible knowing the planet is a ball with 2 sides not able to view the same sky at one time? And what about time-lapse showing perfect separation between the stars? Constellations in perfect order for all of recorded history? Oh, yeah, they&#39;re &quot;infinitely far away&quot;, right?</p>

<p>Ok. Perhaps his model might not be 100% accurately representing the stars as viewed from all angels around a spinning globe, but the concept doesn&#39;t change, or at least not to where you can prove that everyone on a spinning ball sees the same celestial equator. The opposite is true on a spinning ball; you should have a unique celestial equator. In fact, how many different directions are we rotating? 3? 4? </p>

<p>EDIT: I believe you confused the rotating circles with the shape of the planet. The rotating circles are stars as viewed from the planet, according to your spinning ball theory. How should they be represented instead?</p>

<p>You&#39;re right I was confused. I thought the guy was arguing about where in the sky an individual at a certain latitude would view the celestial equator, not that people would be viewing a DIFFERENT celestial equator depending on the latitude. Yes though, it does have to with the distance between us and the stars. </p>

<p>Step into my world for a second. The Earth has a radius of about 6,371 km. Let&#39;s use Alpha Aquarii as our target star. It&#39;s nearly directly on top of the Celestial equator and 520 light years (4.92x10<sup>15</sup> km) away from Earth. If a person views Alpha Aquarii from the equator, and then travels to a pole, how much will the viewing angle change? You&#39;ll have an increase of 6371 in both the X and Y directions. Using trigonometry that works out to 1.29×10<sup>-12</sup> degrees. From pole to pole you&#39;ve got 2.57×10<sup>-12</sup> degrees. That is the maximum amount of &quot;uniqueness&quot; when it comes to that star. Good luck discerning that with the naked eye. It doesn&#39;t get much better even when you&#39;re dealing with much closer stars. That&#39;s why the celestial equator looks the same to everyone.</p>

<p>&#39;Astronomical numbers,&#39; eh? Things no human can actually confirm. And have not confirmed. Or am I mistaken? How can you say that with confidence? I know I couldn&#39;t, however, if you do take that as truth, then I would definitely agree that the math would then confirm that a change in latitude would not cause a significant effect on the viewing angle of said star. This is where the math ends up confirming assumptions, which is the case with your specific example. Obviously, the globe model works, if and only if, your assumption that &#39;stars are infinitely far away&#39;. How do they make these &#39;light year&#39; measurements? What instruments are they using?</p>

<p>Have you read &quot;Kings Dethroned&quot; by Gerrard Hickson? I think you should check it out. It will show you how they couldn&#39;t figure out distance to stars, even after they accepted the helio model, and where, why the method of triangulation fails. No one questioned this issue, yet assumed and promoted that stars were &#39;infinitely&#39; far away. One thing I noticed about modern astronomy is: no one can confirm the claims being made without assumptions. Even a thing as simple as a picture of the spinning ball gets you CGI, photoshop, or fisheye. This to me is disturbing. I do admit that, by making assumptions (i.e. stars are &#39;x light years away&#39;), then you would plug your numbers in math formulas that confirm your assumptions. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>That&#39;s why the celestial equator looks the same to everyone.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Based on assumption of distance to stars? Maybe. It is not as simple as you made it seem, although you are giving it a fair attempt. That&#39;s all you can do, really. Thanks. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Then you probably shouldn&#39;t be trying to argue against it when clearly you don&#39;t understand basic definitions.  Work in physics is a pretty basic concept. It&#39;s like when someone up higher in this thread was saying orbits are too perfect, clearly they don&#39;t know the theories (and theory in this context means more than just a guess) behind how orbits form cause they were saying angular momentum and conservation of  energy/momentum arent that accurate, but actually the idea is pretty straightforward. </p>

<p>How can you ever hope to gain traction to disprove a major tenant of modern science if you don&#39;t even understand some of these basic principles?</p>

</ul>

<p>There are more, and there are multiple different strategies. All converge to the same constant. Why?</p>

<p>Now, in most videos I have seen displaying the Cavendish experiment, every person had a lot of trouble getting the suspended rod in the middle to stay put. It was always moving, even without the extra weights that are placed near the suspended ones.</p>

<p>Looking at relatively shitty recreations of the experiment is a bad idea. More modern, professional recreations attempt to reduce any other outside variables. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>That&#39;s why it is called the <strong>theory</strong> of gravity.</p>

<p>That&#39;s not what that word means. Theories are models in science, not guesses, assumptions or &quot;unproven facts&quot;. </p>

<p>No. </p>

<p>Why is the gravity from Earth not simply keeping the weights where they are, as the pull downwards should be much greater than the pull left or right, should it not?</p>

<p>No. You have to add the force vectors. </p>

<p>This is why. The higher the mass of the two objects in question, the stronger the force between them. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why do they say the Moon is held in by Earths gravity, but the Moon is strong enough to pull on Earths oceans?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because gravity is a two way deal. Earth is pulling on the Moon, the Moon is pulling on the Earth. </p>

<p><strong>Now it&#39;s time for my questions.</strong></p>

<p>Let&#39;s say for a moment that gravity doesn&#39;t actually exist and that the forces we usually attribute to gravity are the result of Density and Buoyancy. Firstly, buoyancy is dependent upon gravity, so I don&#39;t even understand how you can argue that. So let&#39;s instead focus on Density. Why is it that all objects choose to go towards the ground? Why not up? Why not to the left? Imagine a circular object with a certain density. Imagine it was in a fluid with a lower density and that this fluid went on for infinity in every direction with no changes in density. Where would the ball go? Would it start moving? Why? Why would it choose any one direction over any other possibility? If you want, go perform an experiment. Isolate a ball in some homogeneous fluid. Regardless of how you tilt the container, the ball will always go towards the ground. Why? </p>

<p>Oh ya also things still fall in vacuums. Why? </p>

It would still be just as unlikely, except we wouldn’t even be able to explain it because there would be no unifying force. Density and buoyancy don’t work how you think they do.</p>

<p>how do you explain the earth going AROUND the sun and the moon also going AROUND the earth so precisily that it doesn&#39;t even turn.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m not sure what you mean by &quot;doesn&#39;t even turn,&quot; but the reason why planetary objects orbit stars/larger planetary objects is because they are traveling at immensely high speeds but are being pulled on by the gravity of the larger object.</p>

<p>Essentially, if there was no gravity, the object would be going straight (or relatively straight). The gravity is pulling on it, but it&#39;s speed/momentum is so strong that it becomes locked in a roughly circular path.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because only only applies/knows some of the theories of gravity to density. He isn&#39;t aware that the bigger the masses, the more they attract to one another, and the more weight force is applied downwards. So yes, the humming bird is attracted to earth, likewise is the earth attracted to the humming bird, but when you do simple equations such f = m x d, the force of the huming bird attracting the earth is miniscule, and through f = m g the force that earth is attracting the huming bird is also pretty small(doesn&#39;t require much to overcome that), whereas in comparison, the ocean&#39;s water would be huuuuge</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A theory is a web of interconnected, provable and repeatable facts which, when taken together, lead you to a logical conclusion. The theory of gravity says that all objects in the universe are attracted towars each other, the scale of the force depending on how near they are, and how massive they are. The Earth is very near and very massive, so it exerts a large gravitational force, pulling us towards it. We conclude that gravity is the Earth pulling us &#39;downwards&#39;. A theory is not some bizarre idea a bunch of scientists came up with after a night drinking tequila.</p>

<p>Imagine you were above a flat table top and dropped something. If it&#39;s heavier than air (?) It goes down through the not very dense air and rests on the table top (the Earth) because the table top is more dense. Density works almost the same as gravity but gravity is fictional apparently so we just take the properties of gravity and apply them to density (i.e idiot gravity) and boom! Things go down.</p>

<p>While the law lets us calculate quite a bit about what happens, notice that &gt;it does not tell us anything about WHY it happens. That is what theories &gt;are for. In the language of science, the word &quot;theory&quot; is used to describe &gt;an explanation of why and how things happen. For gravity, we use &gt;Einstein&#39;s Theory of General Relativity to explain why things fall.</p>

<p>A theory starts as one or more hypotheses, untested ideas about why &gt;something happens. For example, I might propose a hypothesis that the &gt;object that you released fell because it was pulled by the Earth&#39;s magnetic &gt;field. Once we started testing, it would not take long to find out that my &gt;hypothesis was not supported by the evidence. Non-magnetic objects fall &gt;at the same rate as magnetic objects. Because it was not supported by the &gt;evidence, my hypothesis does not gain the status of being a theory. To &gt;become a scientific theory, an idea must be thoroughly tested, and must &gt;be an accurate and predictive description of the natural world.</p>

<p>While laws rarely change, theories change frequently as new evidence is &gt;discovered. Instead of being discarded due to new evidence, theories are &gt;often revised to include the new evidence in their explanation. The Theory &gt;of General Relativity has adapted as new technologies and new evidence &gt;have expanded our view of the universe.</p>

<p>So when we are scientifically discussing gravity, we can talk about the law &gt;of gravity that describes the attraction between two objects, and we can &gt;also talk about the theory of gravity that describes why the objects attract &gt;each other.</p>

<p>So if you do the thing where you compress the width of the image to make any <a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-NztzUxnbTrc/WECf112ae3I/AAAAAAAACs0/0-sM8paVSVQkVmgQY8lOqCWeX6NAlQHagCEw/s320/lake-pontchartrain-causeway-fe-version-compressed.jpg">horizontal change stand out</a>.</p>

</a></p>

<p>Although I have no idea if their distance measurements are correct.  I seriously doubt that is only 2.9 miles to the horizon, my bet is closer to 10 miles total although the last several miles of that is going to be just a few pixels in this image and you can probably only make out details for about 1 mile. </p>

<p>But I don&#39;t trust memes, Flat Earther memes least of all, so I did an image search and found this was the Lake Pontchartrain Causeway taken by Robert Holmes. </p>

<p>You can find that image in several locations, for example, at <a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-iN_JuJwb63c/WECeYyid9sI/AAAAAAAACsk/SEewA47dE1w9NvheKRbh5SdTForKYDLJgCLcB/s640/lake-pontchartrain-causeway-15.jpg">Travel and Leisure here:</a></p>

<p>I bet you can ALREADY see the issue.  When we compress the width down to 10% on this image <a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-kMvv2MmnqyQ/WECfVij_WfI/AAAAAAAACsw/n3PcuY53nc8uneJPSGDRSWV0JnwB5VyzwCLcB/s200/lake-pontchartrain-causeway-curved.jpg">we can readily see the curve in the image, as plain as day.</a></p>

<p>So someone took this image and FAKED IT to make their little meme work.  That had to be a purposeful act so this is a Flat Out Lie.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is actually super easy to disprove, all I need is a glass of water, a pebble, and a piece of wood. So, we know that the wood will float on the water, and the pebble will sink, so clearly the pebble is more dense than the water, so the pebble will sink through the wood according to your hypothesis. Since this doesn&#39;t happen your hypothesis is false. Some people in here are making this way too complicated.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why do you think a pebble should magically phase through wood?</p>

<p>Air and water are very similar, both are fluids, both conform to shapes, allowing things to pass through them.</p>

<p>Wood is not a fluid. Wood is hard and dense. Wood passes through things, not the other way around. Same with pebbles.</p>

<p>Water is more dense than air, so water is always at the bottom of things, flat and level. Air is less dense than water so it is above the water, but does it pass through it? No, because it is less dense.</p>

<p>Our atmosphere is stacked in layers of density.</p>

<p>The most dense layers are closest to the water, the least dense layers are high up in the sky.</p>

<p>Will wood pass through air? Yes. It is more dense than air. Will it pass through water? No. It is less dense than water. Will a pebble pass through water and air? Yes, it is less dense than both air and water.</p>

<p>Will a pebble pass through wood? No, because wood is a solid, and a pebble is a solid, both are dense objects, they are not fluids.</p>

<p>Did you know there are multiple stages of matter and they effect how that object interacts with its surroundings?</p>

<p>Jeez, its like you threw common sense out the window.</p>

<p>It seems as if you have not thought about why this phenomenon even occurs.  Consider the possibility that buoyancy is a <em>secondary effect</em> - it is caused by gravity and is affected by density.  If not for gravity, how would this mysterious force of &quot;buoyancy&quot; know which way is down?  Do you just assume that buoyancy exists and chooses &quot;down&quot; as the ground for some reason?</p>

<p>According to your theory, I beg that you attempt to answer this question: <strong>why would a bowling ball fall at approximately the same rate in a near vacuum as in 1atm of air pressure</strong>?  Wouldn&#39;t the absence of air make the bowling ball fall slower, since there are not as many air particles pushing on it to lower it down?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You treat magnetic north and south as if they are absolute themselves - they are not!  The earths magnetic field varies as much as its gravitational field does.  Two people on earth may disagree at any given point on what north or south may be, based on the local magnetism of the area they are in.  Much like up and down are different in one spot or another - typically based on the composition and mass of the earth under them. 
 These both are a <strong>measurable phenomenon</strong>.  Much like magnetism.  These are both forces which are generated from fields, where the field is a continuous sum of the vectors of the particles involved.  We are then able to measure the field through its secondary effects on objects within it.  I find it incredibly ironic that you cite magnetism, as magnetism itself is almost as mysterious and &quot;unexplainable&quot; as gravity.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>This has always intrigued me.  It is not hard to perform thought experiments which disprove a lot of what you are saying.  I&#39;m afraid it is you who is blindly afraid - and possibly delusional - to accept the truth.  Contrary to your opinion, most of your arguments greatly complicate the things we have observed in real life.  As an example, you ignored my question in the last post when in fact it is a simple thought experiment that I believe is unexplainable by your world view.  <strong>Please address my question in the previous post if you would like to begin convincing me about your gravity theory</strong>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m actually intrigued by what you&#39;re saying, but I&#39;m having trouble with just one part. You say there is a definite up and down, but why do denser things go down? Why don&#39;t more dense things go up, or left, or east? How do you explain this property, that denser things go down, without some sort of force to act on them in a downwards manner? Buoyancy and Density after all are not forces, they are properties of matter. The heliocentric model uses gravity, if we accept that gravity isn&#39;t real what do we substitute?</p>

<p>Do you think there&#39;s a fundamental flaw in the mainstream understanding of how motion works? If so, could you say exactly how you think Newton&#39;s laws of motion are flawed and what the correct understanding of motion is? </p>

<p>I find this all very compelling except for this one detail that I can&#39;t seem to find a solid justification for, hopefully you can explain it to me.</p>

<p>Theory</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The main reason that science uses the word theory is because there&#39;s no epistemologically valid way to <em>prove incontrovertibly</em> any particular theory. There is no way we can even prove that a reality exists, or that our observations are connected to such a hypothetical. We could be in the matrix, or under the control of God, or any other anternate, and there would be no way we could prove it. </p>

<p>The pragmatic argument is to accept the body of consistent observed evidence as supporting scientific theory. This is not to suggest that this is proof positive of an absolute truth, but rather that the theoretical model has not been substantially disproven by any new evidence. It makes no claim to perfection and is subject to revision in the future, but that is <em>precisely what makes science valuable</em>. It is a predictive model of the universe based on empiricism, not an edict of truth.</p>

<p>Science doesn&#39;t deal in the confirmation of absolute truth, because that is just not possible without the use of base assumptions, a model. It does the next best thing, which is to reject models where contradiction with observations are found.</p>

<p>This is why gravitation is accepted as rigorous science. It is a disprovable theory that simply hasn&#39;t been substantially disproven by any empirical evidence. Relativity did a great deal to improve our model of it, and allowed for investigation beyond Newton&#39;s model, but is far from the final word. This does not make it false though. It&#39;s the best, most rigorous model we have.</p>

<p>Good, I am glad we agree.</p>

<p>There is no proof for gravity.</p>

<p>And no, gravity does not create weight.</p>

<p>That is illogical thinking.</p>

<p>Things are heavy, so gravity must exist?</p>

<p>That&#39;s not what my post said. Not at all. What I meant here was that it&#39;s impossible to prove anything. But that&#39;s not really a useful argument because absolute proof isn&#39;t really necessary for practical purposes.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>fg=mg is a fundamental Newtonian equation. How do you propose buoyancy should cause things to rise? And from what are these things rising? What force is being counteracted by buoyancy?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Things are heavy, so gravity must exist?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Things are massive, and massive things attract each other in our observations. We can point telescopes at the sky and see that. Galileo essentially founded modern science after doing that. Einstein picked up the problem in the 30s and gave us an improved model that by and large was proven.</p>

<p>Last question - how do you suppose gravitational waves were recorded if gravity isn&#39;t real? How does density affect that experiment?</p>

And you could theorise that the pull inward is due to a literal sort of buoyancy or density difference in the fabric of space time itself along this plane of rotation... Just some thoughts.</p>

<p>Clearly it&#39;s a <a href="https://www.metabunk.org/attachments/20170722-185524-apvma-jpg.27881/">very distorted picture</a></p>

<p>They should take a <a href="https://www.metabunk.org/data/MetaMirrorCache/a4fa1f9c4a4746d90e7e23020700768f.png">pic and video</a> with the building clear in the background,  and better equipment with MUCH better zoom.</p>

<p>Most of the curvature becomes apparent at <a href="https://www.metabunk.org/data/MetaMirrorCache/d3024eed228cdb781223b0c872643aaf.jpg">the end of the horizon.</a></p>

<p>The direct video that you linked seems a bit dishonest to me. And I tell you why</p>

<p>The video starts of with the &#39;globe shill&#39; picture that is cropped and already far far zoomed in on the horizon. Because it&#39;s cropped it seems like it starts from the car.</p>

<p>Just where the &#39;flat earth&#39; shill&#39; starts his video at that point in the video, which is completely zoomed out. </p>

<p>For the viewer it&#39;s like both were started from the same perspective. </p>

<p>Except he never even reaches the zoom and  level of resolution.</p>

<p>Pause the video at <a href="https://www.metabunk.org/attachments/20170722-185524-apvma-jpg.27881/">2:13</a> It is after that endpoint where he should zoom in. Compare 2:13 and the pictures for yourself, you&#39;ll see it because of the towering building.</p>

<p>It is MUCH MUCH farther away by the way then it looks 
.  That is the furthest he could zoom..much farther after that point you would <a href="https://www.metabunk.org/data/MetaMirrorCache/d3024eed228cdb781223b0c872643aaf.jpg">clearly see the curvature</a> and rule out any distortion.</p>

<p>In the end of the video he is playing with perspective again and comparing it with their blurry flat pic. </p>

<p>And you&#39;re right, your second video proves the Earth is flat. </p>

<p>But this video proves Earth isn&#39;t flat. They need to bring better equipment.</p>

Because if that&#39;s what you&#39;re going to do, no point in discussing.</p>

<p>Finally, what&#39;s the huge difference to you between observing an existing planet with water stuck to it and building one? It&#39;s not like humanity goes around building stars to experiment with them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah yes forgive me, I forgot about the &quot;two giant spacetime portals&quot; option. Occam&#39;s razor be damned. </p>

<p>The model still doesn&#39;t work though since viewing angles of stars (if they worked like this) wouldn&#39;t match with reality. </p>

<p>Also I just want to point out a mistake this guy made about the Sphere model. He stated that the celestial equator should follow an individual from latitude to latitude if we were living on a sphere. This is false. An observer would be tilted by an angle equal to whatever latitude they were at. This would change the apparent position of the celestial equator. What he disproved was whether or not Earth was a cylinder. I mean for gods sake, he pulls away at 6:20 and reveals that we were looking at things from the inside of a cylinder, not the surface of a sphere. </p>
