    <div class="md"><p>Right. So why don’t you use “simple math” to describe how to calculate the relation between fuel, thrust, and gravity to reach escape velocity?  You know, without using the formula that <em>others</em> derived from differentials.  I doubt you can even “prove mathematically” that it is possible to launch a rocket.</p>

<p>the simplest explanation is probably correct</p>

<p>the moon landing was faked, because it is impossible to do for real</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is exasperating.</p>

<p><strong>Why do you keep bringing up the moon landing being faked or impossible!?  That is not what the argument has been about at all, it is a red herring and a straw man.</strong></p>

<p>This entire time I have been telling you that <strong>the math</strong> for the moon landing is real and works.  It works mathematically.  You posted a half-naked link questioning aspect of physics and math and it is stupid and easily disproven not by me arguing but by googling the calculations and following along if you are capable (not even hard to <em>follow</em> mostly just requires trigonometry and algebra unless you want to follow the derivations which use differential calculus).</p>

<p>This does not prove *<em>anything</em> about people going to the moon because that is not what you were arguing.  This prove that it is mathematically possible no matter how much random info you link that you do not understand how to synthesize.  Why are you looking up snippets about gravity and pendulums instead of just looking up the <em>readily available calculations for the actual moon mission</em> and examining that to see if you find a flaw!?  (Because you don’t have the knowledge to follow them or understand them, that is the real truth).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The rocket doesn&#39;t &quot;escape gravity&quot; on the way to the moon any more than you &quot;escape gravity&quot; when you jump; it just goes a lot higher. Probes that go to other planets do escape Earth&#39;s gravity (technically, it&#39;s the gravity of the Earth-Moon system, which is slightly higher), but it&#39;s because they&#39;re going faster than escape velocity. Escape velocity normally is based on the mass of the body you&#39;re trying to escape from and the distance from its center to the object trying to leave it. However, since the moon is so massive (a rocket is tiny compared to Earth or the Moon so you don&#39;t have to consider its mass), you have to take its mass into account, too. The mean (the orbit is slightly elliptical) orbital velocity of the Moon is 1.022 km/s. At 385,000 km from Earth, its mean orbital distance, the moon would have to be going about 1.4 km/s to escape.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That the United States President is really a prisoner. </p>

<p>This is a plausible reason why Obama is reported saying that there was one debriefing after inauguration that he would have jumped out of a window, if there was one that he could.</p>

<p>The Secret Service is a owned by the Federal Reserve, and there only business is protecting their money, and the president. That protection works both ways. The last president to threaten the bank met a magic bullet. The next guy after him to stand up for him took one trying to get away. Historically speaking so far... the third guy has STFU, and read the damn cards. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pharmaceutical companies are legal drug dealers. They don&#39;t give a damn about patient well-being and are solely interested in making a profit.</p>

<p>Look at the state America is in right now. Responsibility for the opioid crisis falls squarely in the lap of pharmaceutical companies. They lobby with their ridiculous profits to keep it all going, which results in craziness like:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Tramadol being schedule IV, even though it&#39;s just as addictive as other opiates and causes seizures in high doses.</p></li>
<li><p>Benzodiazepines being schedule IV, even though they&#39;re ridiculously addictive and have withdrawals reportedly worse than heroin (and potentially fatal)</p></li>
<li><p>Cannabis being schedule I while marinol (the patented version, just straight THC) is schedule III. They&#39;re the same drug, but plants can&#39;t be patented.</p></li>
</ul>

    <div class="md"><p>Not only that, but when was the last time a straight cure for any ailment was invented by a Pharmaceutical company? My (admittedly shallow) research says every actual cure has come out of a college or grant-funded research group.Why? Far more profit in a drug to manage symptoms that has to be taken regularly and indefinitely, as opposed to a cure which is finite. No real conspiracy needed either, just prioritizing the funding of research for treatments and long term &#39;management&#39; of diseases over cures.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have several favorites, but the theory that that Son of Sam (David Berkowitz) didn&#39;t act alone and was, in fact, part of a cult that committed the murders is probably my all-time favorite. The theory stretches from the heinous ritualistic (and unsolved) murder of Arlis Perry in a church on a crowded college campus in California, to a small town in North Dakota, to the Untermeyer Park in Yonkers, NY, near Berkowitz&#39;s apartment.  </p>

<p>Like many conspiracy theories of this sort, there are strengths and weaknesses to the theory. The strengths are legion. Many, many people within the NYPD believed that SoS did not act alone. The references to referring to &quot;the Wicked King Wicker&quot; and &quot;John Wheaties,&quot; etc., quite clearly refer to the Carr family, who lived on Wicker street near Berkowitz and some of which fled to North Dakota. The theory is very, very strong in my opinion--and I&#39;m a huge skeptic of these things, meaning that I look very hard at source documents and where information comes from and what it <em>actually</em> means before making decisions on validity.  </p>

<p>The weaknesses come, as they often do, from a good-hearted and well-intentioned reported who followed the story where no one else would and ended up believing in things that were no longer supported by the facts. The reporter is Maury Terry, and his book <em>The Ultimate Evil</em> is an absolutely fantastic piece of journalism but for the times when he leans to heavily on speculation and starts connecting dots to Charles Manson, etc., that are not supported in the way that his other research (the Carrs, North Dakota, the California church murder) are. I highly recommend the book, but I caution people to separate out the true facts that are supported with clear evidence, from the places where Terry veers into speculation. The verifiable story that is supported by facts is quite alarming and incredible on its own, and it needs no fanciful embellishment.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s very sad that Terry passed away. Unlike so many conspiracy writers, he was a true investigative journalist and he tackled his subject in the manner of a real journalist--tracking down leads, interviewing witnesses, filing records requests, etc. When he died, any real investigation into the topic ended. </p>

Furthermore, no trauma helicopters were called and the parents were all ok with not going into the school to see their dead child one more time. This would never happen in real life!!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why, in your opinion, is Sandy Hook the dumbest and most paranoid conspiracy? There was a lot to gain. The families of the &quot;dead children&quot; literally became rich as a result and the president got another example of why we desperately need the government to disarm the citizenry, and because this was a &quot;tragedy involving children dying&quot; it becomes very taboo to question it, so much so that it will cause people to lose friends and whatnot if they speak about it publicly. The fact that you think there isn&#39;t anything fishy about Sandy Hook proves that this one is off limits to you, which is exactly what they want, or that you are part of a campaign to push the narrative that Sandy Hook was real.</p>

My guess is that they must have gotten paid a lot of money by the government to lie about what happened.

    <div class="md"><p>There is no better conspiracy (imo) than the New World Order - a secret societal agenda that dates back to biblical times. Honestly there is so much truth to the theory it’s indubitable. People who are and were part of secret societies have been quoted countless times in interviews, speeches, and books basically coming right out and saying “Yeah we control the world.” In 1871, Albert Pike, Illuminati wizard, wrote a letter outlining three world wars <a href="http://humansarefree.com/2011/03/3-world-wars-planned-by-illuminati.html?m=0">src</a>. Also, whether you are religious or not, the Bible prophecized a lot of this stuff, and quoted things like how Satan will disguise himself as an “angel of light.” One can also tie tons of other conspiracy theories within the NWO theory: MK Ultra (not even a theory anymore), 9/11, Holocaust, Titanic, Federal Reserve, Pearl Harbor, Lusitania, USS Liberty, the list goes on and on. </p>

<p>The NWO is the story of the world’s enslavement. It is the reason as to why their is evil in the world. It is the reason why we see endless wars. It is the reason the rich get richer and the poor get poorer. It is the reason governments, banks, corporations, media, etc. are all corrupt. It is the reason why the American education system is a joke. It is the reason as to why “only the good die young,” specifically when good people try to do good things and actually bring about real change in this world. It is the reason the world is brainwashed into believing what they are force fed. It is the reason “conspiracy theorists” are called “crazy.” If only more people knew how to use one thing: logic.</p>

<p>This comment will probably get downvoted and shilled like crazy, as there are obviously many people who disagree, but I urge those of you who made it to the end of this to question everything you see, hear, and read until you can determine for yourself whether it is true.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nah, it&#39;s just insurance. You can establish the government and have the people vote. Political parties work as voting bloc cartels and stifle liberty, so you really need a ranked choice voting system to make sure that the &quot;lesser of two evils&quot; picked by the elite doesn&#39;t have to be the winner. Of course, this requires an aware, informed populace that&#39;s willing to stand up for itself, which isn&#39;t a given, but it&#39;s better than any other system or government or anarchy (which is inherently unstable and doesn&#39;t last because someone less idealistic steps up to fill the power vacuum). You don&#39;t want to have to shoot at the government just to get things done; it&#39;s a last resort when your government can&#39;t be controlled through voting.</p>

<p>Excerpt</p>

<p>“HAARP - a weapons system which disrupts the climate
...HAARP can be used for many purposes. Enormous quantities of energy can be controlled by manipulating the electrical characteristics of the atmosphere. If used as a military weapon this can have a devastating impact on an enemy. HAARP can deliver millions of times more energy to a given area than any other conventional transmitter. The energy can also be aimed at a moving target which should constitute a potential anti-missile system...“</p>

<p>And since Weather Weapons do exist there really is no Big Leap to Anti Gravitation Technology to me (Brotherhood of the Bell, Operation Paperclip, Operation Highjump, Haunebu, Vril).</p>

Not to mention the age at which students generally take on the debt is exactly the time that people are meant to be finding themselves, before they should be asked to think about making such a huge financial decision. </p>

<p>In a later trip out in nature, I could somehow &quot;feel&quot; mother nature, and I would see all the trees morph into animal shapes. Something like seeing a cloud that looks surprisingly like a familiar shape. I wouldn&#39;t really describe myself as an outdoors type or an animal person but yet I had this experience. </p>

<p>There&#39;s a really horrific but worthwhile article that won a prize about why kids die in hot cars that discusses the &quot;swiss cheese effect.&quot; It&#39;s terrifying, basically our brains cache the webpages of our lives and it&#39;s hard to clear cookies. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Terrance mckenna explains it best.   Psychadelics &#39;peel back the layers like an onion&#39; of a lifetime of social conditioning and social programming, biases you didnt even know you existed...  the experience can separarate ones mind from ones ego from ones body from ones soul from ones psyche or any combination thereof or therein or therewithin or whatever-
Suddenly you realize that things you thought were just stuff actually have a lifeforce-  you realize the interconnectedness of every living being every single thing in existence and  for many this is a jarring and cathartic and life-changing forever moment because they now know within their absolute core being that there is a God- an Infinite Source of Love which <em>does indeed</em> know you!</p>

<p>Yea-  so like something like that - give or take.</p>

<p>A psychadelic experience on psyilocybin mushrooms with proper preparation - research, some form of forethought and planning-  might be a 3-6 hour experience.  Maybe 12-14.  But you exit that experience changed subtly forever-  in a positive way.<br/>
Things like politics and hollywood and mass consumerism become boring and repulsive and compassion becomes a bigger part of ones&#39; self.  </p>

<p>Thats my take anyway.  Never used any psychadelic besides natures unprocessed psilocybin mushroom.  (And herb flower cannabis)</p>

I don&#39;t understand how anything you experience while tripping could be considered a reliable experience that tells you how the universe actually is. I get what you mean about changing one&#39;s outlook on life regarding, say, consumerism, but feeling like you&#39;re connected to all life or God or something or that rocks are alive while hallucinating doesn&#39;t mean you actually are, any more than would mean that psychedelic colors and dragons are really all around you and you just can&#39;t see them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, for one thing, the non-hallucinatory (&quot;real&quot;) world is consistent. Things in it are consistent with each other and the experiences of different people show pretty much the same thing in the same circumstances. You can make simple predictions in the real world based on math and science watch them exactly happen. Drug trips aren&#39;t like that. They&#39;re different for different people and their accounts conflict with each other. Although some themes are common, such as a sense of oneness, they aren&#39;t universal and the details conflict. You can&#39;t make testable claims and then experiment to find out if they work.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Theory: he city council in lincoln NE is likely in cahoots with wealthy developers from out of state to approve development projects and literally burn down undesireable businesses to increase property and business values. Examples being the burning down of the cities popular gay bar just inside the downtown highway entrance. burning down a pornshop and forcing the close a punk music venue along the same rout that is now being developed. Burning down our local downtown hispanic culture hub and grocier near campus expansion for unl. At least 2 other grociery stores being burned down in vicinity of down town creating what is being called a food desert. The nearest places to buy food are now generally out of state owned hyvee. Redevelopment of an area of down town full of historic buildings and the best bars in town to encourage buisiness at our new local tax funded out of state owned pinical bank arena. For a good laugh this area called the rail yard is now approaching a world record for most failed new businesses in an area....  </p>

<p>Id say i believe only to the point of suspicion, but it does seem an odd set of changes our city has gone through in a very few number of years.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>JFK. In my global studies class, my senior year of HS, we were divided into thirds, each third assigned a poignant topic in history, and then each of those groups was divided in two, either defending the current narrative or proving it was something else. I was in the JFK was shot by a gunman acting on his own authority, and my group was proving it wasn&#39;t Oswald acting as a lone wolf. It was the easiest fucking project I&#39;ve ever done in a history class, and that was with publicly available material in 2002. We aced it. And that&#39;s why I chose to follow the release of the JFK files recently, and wasn&#39;t shocked at all by what we found. The government killed a sitting President and yet people think they have our best interests at heart. Not only is that not the case, they&#39;re not even indifferent to your presence. They want to suck everything out of you to benefit themselves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sugar is the new tobacco and sitting is the new smoking. Coke &amp; Pepsi are the new Philip Morris. </p>

<p>I had NO idea sugar was in soda when I was very little. I used to just drink water with sugar sometimes. In addition, my parents let me have candy and ice cream at will. Even worse, I did not know sugar caused obesity until I became a biology major. Of course I was a young fat kid who got picked next to last at dodgeball. I count my sugar intake now, it’s roughly 20g total a week if not drinking beer. </p>

<p>You can read up on the sugar subsidies given to farmers which also ties into how wrecked the Caribbean economies  are (outside of  tourism) since they can’t compete. Haiti pre 1800 was the most valuable colony in the entire Americas. It was so valuable, Napoleon tried to wage a war to regain it and failed. Frustrated with his loss, he cut all French continental  ties with  North America and gave the US all of Louisiana when all the US wanted was New Orleans as a trading port. </p>

<p>Back to sugar today , I do believe the negative effects are somewhat   obfuscated by “big soda”. Even the diet sodas are arguably worse for you than the regular drinks. And why do you need a super size? You wouldn’t even need that much straight water with a meal! </p>

<p>I also believe the organic movement is poisoned, so to speak, by MSM portraying buyers as old hippies or douchebag hipsters. You know who’s at Whole Foods when I go? Regular folks, no weirdos. Consumers paying more to (supposedly) get something better in return. </p>

<p>Additionally, I don’t think it’s strictly the lifestyle choices that are making Americans fat. The same food has been around since the 70s in some form. Millions had desk jobs and drove everywhere then. You could binge on Pepsi and Oreos back then if you wanted. Instead, I think certain additives have been added to wreck  your metabolism and disrupt your hormones-specifically the thyroid. First time I ever ate European beef it blew my mind. It’s nothing at all like North American meat. I thought to myself , holy shit, I’ve been ingesting foreign hormones for so long I don’t even know how real meat tastes like.  It is VERY telling hypothyroidism is not even advertised as a health risk nor has an easy way ever been developed to test the level at home. The only diagnosis is a visit to a PCP and blood work. </p>

<p>What are the motives behind this? I can’t say with certainty. 1) TPTB want  corporate profits with infinite growth 2) obesity causes a huge amount of health risks that require time,resources and money to treat. Something that could be avoided entirely with a good diet and moderate exercise. But that doesn’t make anyone any money except $50 a month for a fitness club so where’s the profit in that? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s only &quot;techno babble&quot; to you because you&#39;re too ignorant to understand what I wrote. Since you don&#39;t even understand the most basic things about orbits, you&#39;re in no position to argue that you &quot;proved with math&quot; that the moon landing is a hoax. All you proved is that you don&#39;t understand it and you&#39;re not willing to learn.</p>
