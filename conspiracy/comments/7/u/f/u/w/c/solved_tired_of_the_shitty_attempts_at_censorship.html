    <div class="md"><p>that&#39;s an interesting idea and totally worth looking into if not at least for the semantic query value it brings.  what i was more on about was smells.  the upvotes downvotes system is a smell.  it&#39;s a brief inaccurate heuristic that provides some indication of pattern.  on its own it&#39;s not proof of anything, but in combination with other smells it provides a better model.  so i&#39;d recommend that there be various qualities given to a post that could be checked off.  and that users check off these qualities or maybe even provide their own.  and you then get a meta tagging effect.  you capture the smells.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In current conditions, the upvote/downvote system points unerringly to the propaganda and the most effective counter argument.</p>

<p>The system I&#39;ve been contemplating focuses on epistemology and ontology, not semantics. It is excellent for first separating information from opinion then reassembling the information as a predictive model. The beauty of it is that the fidelity of that predictive model will scale exponentially with the number of participants, reliably select against sources of false information and instantaneously out any attempt to corrupt it by suddenly making bad predictions.</p>

<p>nope.  it misapplies to any sufficiently non-conformist opinion.  and also, it&#39;s clear the the application of strategic downvoting is a strategy, meaning it&#39;s also a choice.  those choices can change.  those strategies can change.  looking at this model as if it&#39;s in any way a repeatable mechanism to expose gaming is false.  </p>

<p>well call it what you want.  it comes down to a labelling system which is a way of applying a quality to a thing.  whatever name you want to give it works for me.  and yes the rest of your points are valid.</p>

<p>This is correct. They can change tactics at will. I hope that they will make it much harder for me to use this particular metric to good effect and, to the extent that they are able, take a particular interest in the people who have been exploiting it. </p>

<p>I&#39;d be really interested in the history of the PizzaGate campaign before the release of the Podesta e-mails. The introduction of that meme to reddit was shockingly effective. They tried to introduce it to r/wikileaks but we had other axes to grind and a much more analytical hive mind. In the moment I took it as a 4chan larp based on the extremely effective use of may mays and the self identification of the may may culture.</p>

<p>yeah this is interesting.  it was totally a setup imo.  it was predated by the badselfeater stuff.  and there were a lot of leaks regarding elite pedo activity that started to gain momentum around 2005ish.  it had been around before but it had been stifled.  we started to see the Kevin Annett work and the organized response to it and the subsequent attempts to ruin his life.  that&#39;s a big tell.  that&#39;s how they roll.  also a guy in 2005ish told me about pizzagate using that exact language.  he basically told me how this leak would go down.  and he was exactly right.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you think it was even necessary for them to have been forewarned of the contents of the DNC leaks in order to prepare that attack or were they just banking on the nature of the attack and the nature of the demographic under attack to overwhelm skepticism?</p>

<p>Assuming yes: how many entities do you reckon stole information from DNC and HFA? How much lead time do you think team may may needed to prep their material? I think that that DC Leaks and the DNC leaks came from different intrusions, and that neither of those intrusions was the phish we all saw: what say you to that?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i can&#39;t speak to those specific examples.  my general feeling is that whole thing has been setup for decades, and that a lot of the groundwork was necessary to put people into positions where they could fail and then be exposed.  i think that&#39;s been a general repeated strategy - to let them dig their own hole.  </p>

<p>in terms of who picked up a lot of the leaked/phished/hacked data - like who also saw it - my guess would be a variety of intelligence services including China and Russia.  it smells like these 2 guys do a lot of watching and know well before things play out what&#39;s going down, because they remain fairly passive and hands-off from the shenanigans.  it&#39;s like they know what&#39;s going to go down.  i say this as just an external observer - i have really no idea what&#39;s going on on the inside.  i just look at the black box of the external surface behaviours of different state actors and try to ask why are they doing or not doing certain things.  all speculative btw...i&#39;m probably not the right guy to ask on this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the current political divide is the consequence of accumulated excursions into the realm of allowing means to justify ends. It appears quite deliberate to me (!), but it&#39;s easier for me to imagine it being &quot;myriad selfishly motivated fuckups&quot; than it is to be &quot;one grand conspiracy.&quot; </p>

<p>Consider the Steele Fuckup, for instance. I think someone doing what they perceived to be normal politics accidentally caused a full on constitutional crisis in The United States of America that is going to echo through history. That&#39;s actually the worst case diagnosis because it implies that corruption is so normal that the people involved don&#39;t even give it a second thought. The fact that the report of the offense is coming from the right place (FBI/DOJ) is quite heartening to me. We&#39;ll get a very clear snapshot of the situation when the evidence is read on the floor of the House.</p>
