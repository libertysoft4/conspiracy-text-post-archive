        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>In this current climate I think it is important to clarify a couple things, especially about the Deep State and government.</p>

<p>If you think the Deep State is only Obama/Hillary loyalists, please slap yourself. Twice. You are doing a tremendous disservice to your fellow conspiracy theorists and distorting the truth to fit your partisan view.</p>

<p>The Deep State is unelected officials who seek to influence and undermine the public. The Deep State ranges from Robert Mueller all the way to Sean Hannity. You think he gives a fuck about you? Pfft, amateur. None of the talking heads on TV do. None of them care about limiting government power and exposing government abuse, they only care when it suits your team.</p>

<p>The Deep State isn&#39;t partisan. It reaches across party lines and unites Ds and Rs. The surveillance state, perpetual war, corporate welfare. These are the things most people in DC agree on, and most people in the USA do not. </p>

<p>Wake up and stop playing team politics.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed, there is shit in both parties, but democrats are the worst, pedophiles, rapists, killers, treasonous people who protect the same kind of people and want to flood you with illegal immigration and terrorist refugees, so in comparison, the R&#39;s are 6 (but not the whole party itself, just many of the people there) on a scale o evil from 1-10, but the D&#39;s are 10-10 so fuck their whole party, THEY ARE THE DEEP STATE. And you can only &quot;share&quot; the guilt, just because they lost the elections, hence all the power they had with the nigger as president, if not, they would have had all the power and by now, we would all be drafted into a massive war, if KILLary had won.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If there are pro-trump people in the deep state, more power to them. </p>

<p>Trump is fighting for the people, the left is fighting for control over the people. Major difference...vegas, pizzagate, 9/11 happened because the ridiculous control the intelligence communities gained from left leaning morons.  You think the past presidents gathering and campaigning last year was just for fun?  No, they are representing the corrupt deep state seeking to combat trumps ‘power to the people’ presidency.</p>

<p>If you don’t think there is a philosophical war at the top (left vs right), you’re a bit blind to reality.</p>

<p><a href="https://intelligence.house.gov/uploadedfiles/memo_and_white_house_letter.pdf">read the memo</a>, the fis courts were being convinced that the evidence was legit by &#39;multiple&#39; sources.  the problem is in the corrupt investigators, not necessarily the court.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I still can&#39;t believe this is even a discussion or needs to be said. The government, every govt, is two sides of the same coin.</p>

<p>It is not until revolution happens, preferably political and without blood being spilt, that we the people will see the world managed how we deserve it to be.</p>

<p>And don&#39;t get me wrong, the average person deserves Jack shit, but they do deserve to be fairly heard and  represented by their government and they do deserve to live a life without constant fear of whether their country/govt is about to turn on them next - through extreme taxes, land theft, wage theft or general lack of security through food/shelter/employment scarcity. </p>

<p>Is it really so hard to simply allow citizens to life a full life? Most of us just want a home, a family, a bit of spare time to persue our hobbies and a network of friends and other citizens to enjoy said life with. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>To me, that isn&#39;t a very good question to ask. Everything, before it was done, had no examples.</p>

<p>We didn&#39;t solve conflict with words once upon a time, we did it with sticks and stones. Why would it be hard to believe that it&#39;s out of the realms of possibility that we as a humanity could move forward from this situation without killing people or getting into a class war. </p>

<p>Besides all that, I said preferably. I mean, I personally would prefer we solve this situation with diplomacy. Will it happen that way? Maybe not. Maybe it will.. Hopefully, preferably, it will. I see human life as too precious to be wasted on violence. How many budding Einsteins would be killed as cannon fodder in this revolution? It hurts me to think about. </p>

This stupid guy is trying to discredit what the republicans have done for america by lumping them in with the corrupt deep state democrats. </p>

<p>The republican party led by trump has done more for america in 1 year than all past deep state presidents combined. Many of these Rs are now on board with trump because he was the only one who said FUCK YOU to the deep state. Without a great leader you can&#39;t get great followers.</p>

<p>Wake up and start supporting the republican party. Not because they are a &quot;team&quot;, but because they are the moral, orderly, functional ones who want great things for americans. And their actions so far has shown this.</p>

<p>That turned out to be false. There is no evidence that Roy Moore did anything illegal and his behavior was considered acceptable at that place and time when the old way of marrying off teenage daughters was still common. I&#39;m not saying I agree with that practice, by the way. All I&#39;m saying is that the allegation that Roy Moore was viewed as some kind of predator in his late 20s or early 30s is a false allegation. I believe the constant references to Roy Moore as a pedo is intended to distract from the more serious pedo problem in our government related to child sex trafficking.  </p>

<p>A 29 year old taking a 16 year old to the movies on the suggestion of her mother is gross, but it&#39;s hardly akin to senior members of our government and law enforcement protecting and participating in organized human trafficking, which is the real story of our time.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>What discredits serious pedo investigations are people who want to bring out the pitchforks against people like Podesta, who have zero accusers, while defending people like Moore and Trump, who have dozens of accusers.  It&#39;s outlets like Fox News, that get all indignant when liberals like Weinstein are accused of sexual harassment, but take a very different tone when it&#39;s one of their own (Wynn).</p>

<p>It&#39;s obvious that done some people, pedo investigations are something that should only apply to liberals.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Largely agree but your definition makes it hard to distinguish any “legitimate” state actors. So somehow I think it must be extended beyond just unelected officials and has to include activity of officials and appointees outside of constitutional bounds or that undermines democratic principles.

<p>You don&#39;t think it&#39;s a little of both? Certain factions of the government are pretty good at what they do, but they sometimes fuck up. Other parts of the government can make really stupid mistakes, and this causes some people to assume the entire government must be just as incompetent. &quot;The government&quot; is actually a bunch of mostly independent parts, and if we are talking about an intelligence community/corporation partnership, they&#39;d generally be pretty good at what they do, but they are not infallible. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Their strongest point and how they survived until this point.... They turn people into psychopaths (Probably through something like MKUltra) and then blackmail them by forcing them to do something extremely evil making a 100% certain way of no one confessing. (This is the obvious conclusion considering the behavior I&#39;ve seen from shills and any other option giving them astronomically low chances of surviving). And I repeat this is their only real strength.</p></li>
<li><p>They lost the election because their analyst are shit, But they assumed their was no way they could lose anyways, Especially because of their rigging. (Which was probably around 10-20% of the votes). </p></li>
<li><p>Their biggest weakness is that it is virtually impossible to do anything useful in reaction to Trump because of how loose their organizational and leadership probably is (Probably just a bunch of rich old bastards that are too dumb and scared to actually <em>lead</em>). And so they aren&#39;t going to fabricate evidence like they definitely should do because again their all retarded and scared and since their isn&#39;t one single dude leading them no one will take charge and do that scary option. Also they will be rigging less votes because of the probably Voter ID and other things coming, <em>AND</em> Trump will be gaining huge amounts of popularity anyways.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>And btw Trump would literally be a godlike liar if he was part of the deepstate. Ever hear about the Red Dinner?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;The CIA and the Cult of Intelligence&quot; by Marchetti. There was a big court case around the book, and the CIA won; they were allowed to block out some sections of the book, because Marchetti was sworn to secrecy as a CIA agent. But you still get a lot of valuable info out of it.</p>

<p>And for Drug War whistleblowers, I strongly recommend Michael Levine and his bestseller &quot;The Big White Lie,&quot; about how the CIA-infiltrated DEA blocked him from going after big cocaine dealers in Bolivia and then when he persisted- they went after him instead. There&#39;s a lot of good material on CIA involvement in the drug trade, the virtual Bible being &quot;The Politics of Heroin&quot; by Yale Professor Alfred McCoy.</p>

And no worries, dude, we all got something to work on. I can be a bit of a stiff for clear communication. But I think that&#39;s because I grew tired at some point of people often reading into what I was saying instead of simply listening to the words as I say them. I tend to go by a quote I once read by Robert Louis Stevenston: &quot;Do not write merely to be understood. Write so that you cannot possibly be misunderstood.&quot;<br/>
But I also try to help others along that path too. I try to be helpful and not to be a dick about it, but we all falter on our paths here and there. That&#39;s how we learn though. It&#39;s all just a learning experience. </p>

Traditionally speaking that term refers not only to high level officials and military officers, but also the obscenely wealthy and powerful private individuals who determine what actions government officials can take.  Bankers, oilmen, military-industrialists...</p>

<p>like, legal privatization was  used to eliminate illegal graft and skimming.<br/>
A.L.E.C. is the most infamous.</p>

<p>It is now entirely legal to profit from tax money meant for services. 
That is what privatization is. </p>

<p>Hand a government mandated service over to a private contractor, money that once went to good wages and retirement and health care now goes for profit and the contractor hires their workers at reduced wages and no benefits at all.  </p>

<p>Just because the producers were thinking &quot;people will watch this to see what crazy thing he says next&quot; doesn&#39;t change the fact that it was millions upon millions of dollars worth of free advertising. Campaign rallies are basically one long campaign ad for the candidate.</p>

<p>Much like how the OP says the deep state isn&#39;t primarily concerned with partisanship, neither is the media. They mostly care about money and ratings, so they filled the airwaves with Trump.</p>

<p>What discredits serious pedo investigations are people who want to bring out the pitchforks against people like Podesta, who have zero accusers, while defending people like Moore and Trump, who have dozens of accusers.  It&#39;s outlets like Fox News, that get all indignant when liberals like Weinstein are accused of sexual harassment, but take a very different tone when it&#39;s one of their own (Wynn).</p>

<p>It&#39;s obvious that done some people, pedo investigations are something that should only apply to liberals.</p>
