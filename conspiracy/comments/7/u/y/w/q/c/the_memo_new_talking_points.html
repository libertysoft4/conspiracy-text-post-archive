<p>Talking points I&#39;ve seen on this site since the release:
1. Partisan BS
2. We already knew all this / All Hype / No Substance / Nothing Burger
3. Dossier was only partly used
4. Why is no one talking about this now that it&#39;s released / TD 2.0 much.
Please add to list. </p>

<p>Listen everybody, maybe this dossier was partisan, I&#39;m not saying one way or another, but that doesn&#39;t matter. The important questions for this sub are. What information on the memo did <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> already know? Was there any new information on the memo we didn&#39;t know?</p>

<p>My impression is the memo was released so normies could have a concise reference to all the connections we here at <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> have already made. This wasn&#39;t meant for us, it was meant for the masses.</p>

<p>I thought it was interesting how every 6 months they would need a new warrant and multiple people signed off without any new evidence presented and with much information withheld. </p>

<p>2) Since only one person was able to see the underlying documents, Nunes sent Gowdy, and then wrote the memo based on what Gowdy told him.</p>

<p>3) No Democrat was allowed to see the documents.</p>

<p>4) Furthermore, the Republican-majority House voted against allowing the Democrats to even present a counter memo.</p>

<p>5) Gowdy- the only one who has even seen the underlying documents, remember- <a href="http://thehill.com/homenews/house/372054-gowdy-nunes-demo-does-not-discredit-mueller-probe-in-any-way">has gone on record to say that he disagrees with Nunes&#39; interpretation</a>, that the memo doesn&#39;t discredit Mueller&#39;s investigation (despite what Nunes says). Furthermore, Gowdy has since announced that he&#39;s retiring from politics.</p>

<p>This whole thing was just a hamfisted attempt by Nunes to discredit Mueller, the FBI, and the investigation... all to protect Nunes&#39; boss, Trump.</p>

<p>The memo is not intended to discredit the Mueller investigation. If anything it points towards Russian collusion( Russia fed Steele bullshit, Dems ate it up).</p>

<p>Gowdy is retiring from politics.  It is a nice change of pace to see someone just retire and not retire in disgrace.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your 4th point is factually incorrect if you’re to believe Schiff’s written message a few days ago. In reality the Democrats wrote their own memo, it was decided that it would have to go through the DOJ/FBI to be verified, the would be sent back to be put to a vote (the exact process that Nunes’ memo was put through) and will be put to a vote on Monday, Feb. 5th, to either be released or not. Please either remove that talking point or do your best to quit repeating it as it is factually incorrect and the last thing this entire debacle needs is to have even more disinformation about. </p>

<p><a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/RepAdamSchiff/status/958897790469464064/photo/2">Mobile like to Schiff’s verified twitter</a>. On the second page in the last paragraph he explicitly states that this coming Monday, Feb. 5th, they will vote on the Minorities (Democrats) memo to be released as it has now been verified by all required parties. </p>

<p>Sorry to be so rash/harsh but this is seriously getting out of hand and watching people come in and out solely to defend one party, while using incorrect talking points, is really getting out of control and I feel like we should keep all discussions to an absolute factual basis to the best of our abilities. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Five days ago:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.npr.org/2018/01/29/581718405/intel-committee-votes-to-release-secret-gop-memo-withhold-democrats-rebuttal">House Intelligence Committee Ranking Member Adam Schiff told reporters on Monday evening that the majority used another party-line vote to reject his motion to release his secret memo responding to Nunes&#39; memo.</a></p>

<p>Then on Friday:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/02/02/politics/democrats-memo-russia-adam-schiff-devin-nunes/index.html">&quot;Well, we are going to try to force another vote on this,&quot; Schiff told CBS on Friday about his memo. &quot;The Republicans voted down the release of the Democratic response, which was quite breathtaking, because they said they were offering their own memo in the interest of full transparency.&quot;</a></p>

<p>So it looks like my fourth item stands, especially since the Republicans control the House- any <em>future</em> vote to release a Democrat memo rebuttal will have an uphill battle.</p>

<p>I wonder if you&#39;re being quite so vigilant against factual inaccuracies when they come from the Republican side.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jesus the two articles are in direct conflict with what Schiff said a few days ago (after those articles were written). They are literally voting on the Dems memo ON MONDAY FEBRUARY 8th. There’s no battle. It will be a vote. This comes directly from a letter that Schiff wrote HIMSELF. </p>

<p>Your point doesn’t stand because it is factually false. There will be a vote to release the memo (you know, the one you said wasn’t even allowed to be written) in two days from now (according to the source that you claim wasn’t even allowed to write the memo). I feel like I’m taking crazy pills right now. </p>

<p>And the political leaning attack was cute, but even your two sources completely refute what you wrote! Your 4th statement claims that the Dems “weren’t even able to <em>present</em> a counter memo”, but your first article actually says that Schiff presented a memo, and was voted down (due to not being put through the same verification process as Nunes’), and your second article says <em>the exact same thing</em>. </p>

<p>Surely you can turn off your bias and realize that what you said is actually complete garbage and factually incorrect by not only BOTH of your own articles, but also straight from the horses mouth, which is what your two articles are based off of. </p>

<p>Schiff WAS allowed to present a counter memo, and did, but it was not submitted to the same verification process as Nunes’, so it was shot down, twice. Schiff then said, not more than 2 days ago, via a letter posted to his verified twitter account, and submitted to Nunes, that his own memo would be put to a vote on Monday and has now been submitted to the same verification process. So your claim that the Democrats weren’t even allowed to present a counter memo is a straight up fucking lie because they presented it TWICE, and will now PRESENT IT A THIRD TIME. </p>

<p>So I say again, PLEASE, get your bullshit unfactual talking points out of here, so we can discuss actual things that have happened and been verified, PLEASE. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They <em>did</em> vote. The vote was to release the minority memo <em>to the public</em>. It failed, and the votes were along party lines.</p>

<p>You seem to be thinking that Schiff wasn&#39;t able to present the minority memo to the House- but my claim was that the Republicans voted against allowing the report to be released with the majority memo.</p>

<p>It appears that there&#39;s going to be <em>another</em> vote... according the the articles I posted, and Schiff&#39;s statement in those articles. <strong>You are arguing about a completely different thing</strong>. <em>You</em> are trying to spread misinformation and conflate the two issues.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is literally the OP:</p>

<p>4) Furthermore, the Republican-majority House voted against allowing the Democrats to even present a counter memo.</p>

<p>This states that the Democrats weren’t even allowed to <em>present</em> a counter memo. This is bullshit and doesn’t belong anywhere. They were allowed to <em>present</em> a memo, and it was voted down because it hadn’t gone through the verification process. It has since gone through that process and will be voted on again on Monday now that it has been verified. To say the Dems weren’t allowed to present a counter is nothing other than a fucking lie and you’ve done everything to not only prove it, but also to not admit you’re wrong after being proven wrong BY YOUR OWN EVIDENCE! </p>

<p>They’re literally the same instance. A memo was literally presented to Congress and they voted not to release it. It was presented to them. They presented it. They made it. They decided to vote on it. It was presented for a vote. I don’t know how else you would like to say it, and your arguments literally agree with that. They are one in the same. The Democrats literally presented a counter memo. That happened and to argue that it didn’t is just nonsense. </p>

<p>If you want to argue that what you <em>meant</em> by your stupid vague lie was that “the Democrats weren’t allowed to <em>RELEASE</em> their own memo because it was voted down by the Republicans”, then change the OP to reflect what actually happened. And please don’t omit that the reason for that down vote was because a lack of verification process that Nunes’ memo went through. Don’t try and muddy the waters by saying “I meant this when I said that” because it’s shit like this that puts the citizens of the US in shitty situations like the one we are in right now, where bots and misinformation is being put out everywhere, and you have to weed through a mountain of bullshit to find the truth. </p>

<p>If someone who wasn’t familiar with the situation were to read your OP, they would be under the impression that the Republicans dome how blocked the Democrats from even making an argument at all, and that is a fucking bullshit lie. You’ve said as much, your links have said as much, and Schiff has said as much. You’re being purposely vague to further your argument and there’s no place for it. And your first attack is to play the partisan card when all I’ve done is point to your vagueness as a counter argument, to which you posted evidence favoring my arguments. So again, please reflect your OP to what you actually meant, or remove that talking point because it’s false as it’s written.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your comment never explicitly said anything about <em>releasing</em> the Dems memo, and it implied (heavily I might add) that the Dems weren’t even allowed to make their own memo, which is false by all accounts. Clearly I haven’t “lost” anything. You clearly don’t understand the implication of what you’ve said and now it’s obvious that you were being purposely vague in order to confuse people and in the hopes that you could show the internet how “smart” you are. I’m glad that we’ve all agreed that you were lying and you just wanted to argue semantics about it to a random person.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. The thing is Dems and FBI have lied about everything.</p>

<p>Ex. Memo is a grave threat to national security/is a nothingburger </p>

<p>Well, that is bullshit.</p>

<p>Ex. Republicans are stonewalling the dem memo. Again, bullshit. Anyone who reads the memo knows Nunes made a motion to vote on the dem memo .</p>

<p>No one can tell me why Steele was taken seriously(the Russians said this guy is an idiot). No one can say why Page was being spied on. If the bar for  espionage is set at “he has been to another country and done business with foreigners” everyone in politics should be spied on. And am I really supposed to believe that Papadopoulos(a volunteer intern) is anything more than a young guy who lies? The timeline for his surveillance doesn’t add up.</p>

<p>The tides are turning and the memo was news to people. Any Average Joe who said they knew exactly what the memo contained(prior to release) is lying.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Anyone who was following the Russian investigation pretty much saw the parroted talking points when they first read through.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t see how this would bring &#39;normies&#39; to the light. It was partisan skewed, and a really pathetic attempt to discredit the Mueller investigation. Any attempt to discredit a non partisan investigation into any branch of government is treason in my book.</p>

<p>Everyone involved in writing this and hyping it up should be ashamed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the official talking point on a national level is going to change to Russia tricked both the Dems &amp; Repubs.  A former CIA officer write a op-ed last weekend laying the grounds for the new talking point, then yesterday Mr &#39;this is a horrible bill, but I just voted for it&#39; John McCain release his statement on the memo which seems to be the same talking point.  We&#39;ll see!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Attempts were made at both Republicans and Democrats. From what we are seeing Democrats took the bait. Russia “hacks” look more like localized leaks. In a round about way Russia gave Dems/FBI everything they needed to screw themselves, Trump and America. Russia and America play games with elections. That isn’t a secret. And while Russia was playing games it also showed everyone what Democrats and the FBI did.</p>
