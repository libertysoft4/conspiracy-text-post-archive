<blockquote>
<p>Due to the amount of violent content and symbolism posted on your sub, we are unable to keep it active per our policies concerning violent content. This sub will be banned immediately.</p>

<p>There were no complaints of &quot;violent content or symbolism&quot; and no such posts that were not promptly removed.</p>

<p>Reddit admins are liars who hate free speech and want exercise control of political sentiment across the entire domain. Subscribers to this sub need to know that if they are under the illusion that reddit is a free speech platform.</p>

<p>I realize some people feel like they need to respond to the perception that all white people are inherently racist which we know is not true. However you have to admit the type of user that subject brings is rarely civil. </p>

<p>As I said earlier, if they are rooting out all the subs that represent a racial divide then I’m ok with it. If your sub has been singled out arbitrarily then that’s not cool. </p>

<p>That might work if they were honest and conscientious people but they are not. They are dishonest people, as evidenced by the bald-faced lies written by the admin who banned the sub. And don&#39;t think there haven&#39;t been many examples of their hypocrisy and double standards communicated to them 1,000&#39;s of times over the past ten years.</p>

The process called &quot;White flight&quot; is just a euphemism for the slow ethnic cleansing of Whites from neighborhoods that have been colonized by minorities coupled with an exodus to overwhelmingly White suburbs where we can enjoy safe, White spaces.  It seems people like you believe we have no right to separate ourselves from the likes of you. Why?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is a form of discrimination. I agree with that. But the fact is that if you have a white person and black person with the exact same application and credentials, the white person is much more likely to be picked over the black person. This has been confirmed with research studies and data to back this claim up.</p>

<p>In addition to that, poverty is cyclical issue that can affect generations. If you are born in poverty or an uneducated family, then you are much more likely to remain poor and uneducated throughout your life. This is true of all races and peoples.</p>

<p>But, for generations and for hundreds of years, there was purposeful racial discrimination and enslavement of black people. There are people who are still alive today that were alive during the times of segregation and Jim Crow laws, it wasn’t that long ago.</p>

<p>When you have majority of families of one race being purposely held back and held down for so long, it requires polices like affirmative action to help break that cycle.</p>

<p>And just because there are more black people or minorities in the work place or school does not make it ethnic cleansing.</p>

<p>I would probably say how men have to be tough and not talk out their issues, but instead use violence to retaliate against others who have wronged them. But, there are a ton of non-profits that are run by other black people along with others, to end issues like this in black communities. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The same problems have grown exponentially over the last 50 years with only a very thin veneer of success. The &quot;cycle&quot; is worse than it&#39;s ever been and you&#39;re helping to keep it that way. The blood and treasure thrown into this pit is incalculable. All of the attempts at leveling the playing field have failed so demonizing whites, ad nauseum, is apparently the next phase. The path has been cleared for blacks and they still can&#39;t succeed at the same rate whites do. Stop making excuses and be honest.</p>

<p>You <em>are</em> attempting to shame whites who have had enough of the false narrative you perpetuate. That&#39;s more than evident from your various comments here.</p>

<p>The narrative you perpetuate implies blacks must be allowed to maintain their own separate culture within the US while maintaining the right to blame white culture for it&#39;s failures. Like it or not, the dominant successful culture is white culture yet we&#39;re to blame when blacks refuse to become part of that culture? The hypocrisy is so thick it&#39;s simply stupid. Asians do very well using the same template that has worked well for whites, what&#39;s the difference? Creating division is a necessary component to the perpetuation of the corrosive narrative.</p>

<p>Why are people like Trayvon Martin, Tookie Williams and Michael brown held up as black victims and heroic figures when it&#39;s been proven they are not? All were criminals who initiated violence and paid the price yet we&#39;re expected to view them as victims. There&#39;s no other conclusion to draw from this piece of the narrative than, we&#39;re being conned. </p>

<p>In the end the white vs. everyone else narrative is a divisive tactic that prevents unity. Call it whatever you like the NWO, globalism, technocracy or simply one world government. Unity of the citizenry is the number one enemy of the powers that be. That&#39;s where this all ends. Black or minority success is not and hasn&#39;t ever been the goal. Since whites have been generally happy with their societies that nut needs to be cracked in order to erase their borders and self governance. Nothing else makes sense. Defending blacks is nothing more than divisive busy work. The powers that be know nothing is going to change in that arena. </p>

<p>No, it&#39;s to end the cycle. I&#39;m white, and I don&#39;t feel any amount of guilt because I had nothing to do with the crimes of injustice that have been done. I do believe in fairness and equality, and I do believe that affirmative action is one way of breaking historic cyclic poverty. </p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t provide a single incentive for blacks to improve their own lot in life</p>

<p>If they are trying to apply for jobs or to apply for college then they are trying to improve their lot in life.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not shaming anyone. I just care other people besides myself. </p>

<p>Helping black people improve their life is not telling them to remain on the plantation relying on scraps. </p>

<p>Few successful blacks share in your pity party.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What pity party? I just want to end cyclic poverty and discrimination against black people and other minorities. I also care about cyclic poverty for white people as well, and I support programs that do that. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Can you name one failure of black culture that blacks are responsible for?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would probably say how men have to be tough and not talk out their issues, but instead use violence to retaliate against others who have wronged them. But, there are a ton of non-profits that are run by other black people along with others, to end issues like this in black communities. </p>
