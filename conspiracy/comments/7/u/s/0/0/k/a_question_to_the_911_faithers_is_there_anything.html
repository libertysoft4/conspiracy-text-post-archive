    <div class="md"><p>Note, I am answering OP&#39;s question and even if it doesn&#39;t fit with <em>your</em> ideas, I don&#39;t expect downvotes for simply answering.</p>

<p>I believe there were four US planes that were hijacked that day, and three of them hit their marks, and one failed.  I believe that the two WTC towers and WTC 7 were brought down due to the enormous damage caused by the planes and subsequent fires, with WTC collapsing from the damage caused by the collapse of the first two towers and subsequent fires.  I do not believe there were any previously-planned explosions used to bring them down.</p>

<p>Now, how much did our government know, and even participate either actively or passively?  I don&#39;t think we&#39;ll ever know.  </p>

<p>WTC collapsing from the damage caused by the collapse of the first two towers and subsequent fires.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Must point out that here you are departing from the official story insofar as according to NIST the damage to WTC7 caused by falling debris did not play a significant role in initiating the collapse. NIST has stated plainly that the building would have collapsed absent any debris damage. </p>

<p>From the FAQ:</p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Would WTC 7 have collapsed even if there had been no structural damage induced by the collapse of WTC 1?</li>
</ol>

<p>Yes. Even without the structural damage, WTC 7 would have collapsed from the fires that the debris initiated. The growth and spread of the lower-floor fires due to the loss of water supply to the sprinklers from the city mains was enough to initiate the collapse of the entire building due to buckling of a critical column in the northeast region of the building.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Through your analysis, have you come across any other steel frame buildings known to have collapsed because of fire in the history of steel framed buildings? Have you ever seen any plane crash like that of Shankesville, where no resemblance of a plane is visible i.e., no engines, tail section, landing gear, seats, luggage etc were visible? Any theory as to why the only piece of “evidence” shown to the American public that a “plane “ hit  the pentagon was a few sec clip from the parking area, which doesn’t show a damn thing...when the whole building has camera surveillance and 24/7 CCT. What about secret service going to every business around that area to confiscate video tapes to never be returned to said businesses within mins of the supposed attack. Kinda convenient that the only place to be hit was a recently remodeled section of the pentagon housing the financial department, when just the day prior 9/10, Donald Rumsfeld admitted to US that the pentagon couldn’t account for 2 trillion dollars. How about the simple fact that most of the supposed hijackers (most were still alive after the attack)were from Saudi Arabia, but instead of invading them (one of our allies) we invade Iraq based on some BS weapons of mass destruction that never existed. What about numerous videos where people described hearing explosions, and there’s also videos where you hear these explosions. Firefighters talking about floors just started popping out “like there were demolishing the buildings”. War games on the same day with the exact same scenarios as what supposedly happens on 9/11. Put options on the planes and businesses effected by this attack, people told not to show up to the WTCs and New York that day. Cmon man, if you’ve analyzed just some of these things (and there are thousands more anomalies) and somehow still come to the conclusion it happened like they said it did, I’ll just chalk up to cognitive dissonance I guess.</p>

<p>There are no other crashes as such a high rate of speed and at such a steep angle.  There are some crashes that look similar but all have more rubble, no doubt. </p>

<p>No</p>

<p>There is one video with an explosion, long after the twins collapsed, and it could be a lot of things. As for &quot;hearing&quot; explosions, yes, loud noises do sound explosive. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can barely decipher whatever it is you’re trying to say..but the last sentence...what, you think they can only demolish buildings bottom to top? As long as core structure is removed, they can set up electronic detonation anyway they want. Shit is all set up on timers and remotely detonated...you know on timers so everything falls and collapses the way they want. Thus the reason there are demolition teams that do this shit for a living, not just set some fires and watch buildings collapse symmetrically a few hrs later. Everyone does realize that in order for these buildings to collapse symmetrically and at free fall all support columns, trusses etc have to fail simultaneously right? If they didn’t it would have been an asymmetrical collapse..and none of the 3 buildings that collapsed that day did that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Gonna say this and try to forget it, because it hurts.</p>

<p>You know the Pascal&#39;s Wager thing - where the Christian philosopher Blaise Pascal explained that a betting person would have the best odds in the afterlife if they took on faith in the Christian God? Because, if you die and that&#39;s it, so does everybody, but if you die and your faith determines WHERE, then it&#39;s worth the bet to be there, nagging doubts or not.</p>

<p>So let&#39;s talk about 9/11. Nobody knew exactly what to expect back then. The vast majority of Americans entered into a sort of Pascal&#39;s Wager mode, in which they intuitively decided the best bet was to go right along with the story they were told. After all, who knew how bad things were going to get, early on? </p>

<p>So, if indeed &quot;they&quot; had started throwing people into jail for &quot;terrorist sympathies&quot; based on how each person did or did not express &quot;questions&quot; about how 9/11 went down, then the safer bet was to stay silent, and at least superficially act like you believed it all. If it was later proved to be otherwise, those people could always say &quot;how did I know?&quot; and otherwise, well, they weren&#39;t asking for no trouble.</p>

<p>That effect may be wearing off. But for some people it&#39;s still an issue of faith, and will be for life. </p>

<p>(full disclosure: I do believe in Pascal&#39;s faith stance, but I don&#39;t believe in 9/11 faith - the secret government cannot hurt me that much...I hope - if we all stand together we probably won&#39;t hang together!)</p>

Al Qaeda had highly trained operatives who were well trained for their assignments.  Up til then skyjacking almost always ended in ransom demands or political concessions so airline crews were taught to go along with skyjackers.  Airport security was abysmal.  The tactics used were innovative and everything happened in an extremely short time, 109 minutes so response was impossible. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I could probably be called a faither on this subject but I can tell you that I certainly don&#39;t think the US government is 100% honest, nor that they necessarily should be.  To me the idea that a couple Saudi dudes decided to fly some planes into buildings because they were brainwashed and hated America (not unreasonable given the role America has sometimes played overseas) and that the US government did not explicitly want this to happen seems reasonable, and old buildings falling down after being hit by large jets seems reasonable too.  At the very worst, in my mind, the US government allowed it to happen, though to me incompetence seems far more likely.  The government reports absolutely did want to hide their own incompetence and the roles played by American allies however and had a million other motives, none of which was telling the American people the truth.  </p>

<p>The Bush administration certainly did everything they could to capitalize on the crisis, including pretty blatant lies and misdirection to somehow spinning it into an invasion of Iraq and a strengthened alliance with Saudi Arabia, but frankly I don&#39;t think the US needs something as drastic as 9/11 to convince the average American they want war and if they did they&#39;d do a better job of it.  I mean, the terrorists could&#39;ve at least been from a country you want to paint as an enemy, not a friend.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its interesting that the person who doesnt believe something else took the buildings down has to explain themselves but the people who don’t believe what we all watched live isnt what really happened have to give no explanation. </p>

<p>Those buildings began collapsing at the point of impact, how can you argue that something else took them down?</p>
