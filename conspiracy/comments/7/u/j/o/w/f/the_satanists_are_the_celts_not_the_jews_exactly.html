        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>pretty much a giveaway.  we know the history of ireland and scotland.  we know the celts existed in scythia and migrated.  same symbols.  same rituals.  same human sacrifice.  judeo-masonic symbology.  dickjokes.  lots of peters and whatnot.  it&#39;s all the same giveaway.  </p>

<p>there have been a few posts on this in the last day or so, but they&#39;re all around here and have been for a while if you search.  the remnants of the egyptian ruling class went to scotland and continued on.  they use human sacrifice as a way of thinning the herd.  it&#39;s a selective device.  and that&#39;s why they&#39;ve selected for intelligence.  it&#39;s been at the cost of care, and you see this too.  basically it&#39;s a selective machine and the results of that selection are clear.  go to any of the places they are at and you&#39;ll see high intelligence and lack of care.  real huge giveaways.  </p>

<p>they don&#39;t like the average jews.  that&#39;s a for sure.  if they did they&#39;d not be arranging circumstances to try to remove them.  judaism itself suffers from this celtic/satanic design, too.  so not to excuse them either.  and again you can look at the texts because they&#39;re essentially code for a social machine.  that social machine kills.  so we see the manifestations of that machine.</p>

<p>that&#39;s it.  if you want to know who is who, just look at the machinery of their society.  it&#39;s the biggest tell.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>sure.</p>

<p>on the symbols.  they use phi designs.  phi is essentially this formula distilled : old + now = new.  it&#39;s fibonacci.  it&#39;s the hegelian dialectic (theis-&gt;antithesis-&gt;synthesis).  it&#39;s the trinity.  it&#39;s the general idea that things grow in layers.  so what you want to look for are spirally layered designs that have 3s of things to them, and that loop back on themselves.  the pyramid is another 3ish kind of design as well.  anyway here are the symbols.  these exist all over the word and are indicative of this cult.  <a href="http://www.whats-your-sign.com/celtic-symbol-meanings.html">http://www.whats-your-sign.com/celtic-symbol-meanings.html</a></p>

<p>the use of dickjokes is all around masonry.  tubal cain (2 ball cane).  manly p hall (a male&#39;s pee channel).  st peter (this is all over the place.  st petersburg.  st. peters basilica.  chair of st. peter).  you&#39;ll see them done using a lot of phonetic tricks - it may not be literal but if you sound it out it&#39;s a dick joke.  another common idiom they use. </p>

<p>well this is an interesting tell.  so the way i reckon this control system works is that it selects along bloodlines and tries to dumb everyone else down.  so you&#39;ll a bifurcation in places where these guys go.  you&#39;ll see a lot of a &quot;hero class&quot; of elite and a lot of really dumb people often who adopt victim mentalities.  that&#39;s a design manifestation of hierarchical systems, imo.  and hierarchical systems in this model are handled along bloodline.  that&#39;s where the crown comes from.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>entering wacky territory here.  my specific claims about this group are that they have time travel.  and they are interested in creating a &quot;superman&quot;.  so they are very careful with their bloodlines.  the timetravel knowledge is a huge advantage tactically, but others have subsequently acquired this knowledge and there&#39;s a competition going on currently.</p>

<p>the symbols they use indicate that they understand design principles.  they&#39;re not dummies.  and these design principles are the secret knowledge of the egyptians as well.  </p>

<p>regarding behaviour.  this is an easier one to break down.  society is a machine.  the rules of that machine dictate the consequences.  so you just have to look for what behaviour is bred into people and what the typical consequences to the cohort are of their social design.  and what you see is telling.  jews manifest signs of their design as well.  it&#39;s interesting to see how it goes from policy to reality over a relatively short period of time.    </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There definitely are very very dark sects of Celtic faiths, but it’s not fair to generalize all pagans as being malevolent. There are good pagans and bad pagans, just like with Christianity and all other religions. I am deeply interested in the ancient Faerie Faith of my ancestors, I also believe in God, Jesus and Angels. They aren’t mutually exclusive, Angels and Faefolk exist in different realms. Angels exist in a higher dimension than humans have the capacity to really conceive of. Faeries, elves, leprechauns, etc. are in a realm that doesn’t seem to be higher or lower than ours, the Otherworld is more like an alternate version of Earth. I think that we are able to perceive and interact with Littlefolk in times and places when/where the division between our worlds isn’t as solid. I’m not sure if the malevolent littlefolk inhabit the Otherworld or a lower dimension(no personal experience to go on with them) For demons in the traditional Christian sense, they live in a realm deeper and denser than the Otherworld (Otherworld=/=Hell). Almost like the twisted opposite realm than that of the Angels, but the demons aren’t nearly as trans dimensional and powerful as Angels, they just try to deceive you into thinking they’re as powerful and Godly beings as Angels.</p>

<p>TLDR: Not all Pagans are malevolent against humanity, the Celtic Faerie Faith has good and bad aspects like all religions and superstitions. </p>
