        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>We all should already know the effectiveness of compartmentalization. Understanding how most conspiracies tie together to expose the bigger agenda is what the conspiracy community has always been about.</p>

<p>They want to cast an extra veil to hide the bigger picture. Send in the annoying partisan shills and use that as justification to call for compartmentalization. Just as the deep state sends in their mercenary terrorist groups into a country so they can then call for invading and overthrowing a country.  </p>

<p>Edit...   notice the new accounts and older accounts that you have never seen before, that are cheer leading for the compartmentalization of this sub. They love to talk as if THEY represent the majority voice of this sub. Don&#39;t fall for it. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t mind seeing content here that includes US political drama but only if it&#39;s original and alternative to the drivel in the MSM.</p>

<p>We absolutely do not need this to become a news feed for every damn headline and even after sub statements that&#39;s still a lot of what&#39;s left. While there could be a bit of validity to OP statement, the &quot;spirit&quot; of the sub was always to spur discussion and post interesting, alternative, or original resources. </p>

<p>Most of these headline-oriented posts don&#39;t add much, particularly if they just link to something I can easily find on any other site.</p>

<p>I despise trolls like this guy. He doesn&#39;t even realize he is a troll, which is makes it very sad. If you look at his <em>5 year</em> comment history, you can tell he is an inflammatory douchebag almost everywhere he goes. Its hard to fathom how he hasnt created an alt after all these years and somehow thinks that makes him a gatekeeper.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thats not whats happening though, and you are proclaiming yourself a gatekeeper. You realize what kind of low-IQ bullshit that is, right?</p>

<p>Its funny how you argue against the only sarcastic thing I said and then the important part: Me calling you a gatekeeper. Which is exactly what you are doing. And you are such a troll that you wont reply to me with a retort on that point. You are defying hard-laiden concepts on this board that <em>real</em> users use to sort through the bullshit. Im afraid you and your gatekeeping fall firmly within the &#39;bullshit&#39; category. </p>

<p>The stream of concern posts about politics on r/conspiracy has been constant since the last presidential election. There are several conspiracies that have been spawned from these events. The influx of people who want to focus on political conspiracies is something we should accept and take as an opportunity to introduce new layers of conspiracy culture. </p>

<p>I have been here on this sub, participating in this community every day for 5 years. I don&#39;t care when you started using the internet. This has been a community. What if I went over to say r/politics for the first time and on my first day exclaimed that I am the voice of this sub and I want this sub to change?</p>
