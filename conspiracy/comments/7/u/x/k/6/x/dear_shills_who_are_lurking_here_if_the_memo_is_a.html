<p>Carter Page had been under FISA warrants for 9 times since 2014.</p>

<p>If Trump hires a firm for opposition research, and they find actionable intel about his opposition&#39;s illegal activities, he has every right to bring it to the attention of law enforcement. Though he might eschew that move entirely, as his playbook consists of colluding with hostile foreign nations in order to smear his opponent, while promising the easing of sanctions in return. And that is wildly illegal. - FACT</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While we&#39;re at it - it&#39;s also a fiction that Comey &quot;admitted under oath that the memo was salacious and unverified&quot; - or at the very least it&#39;s disingenuous. Comey admitted to having referred to SPECIFIC PARTS of the information that way - meaning, he said to Trump that some of the &quot;salacious&quot; parts were as of yet unverified. He then, in the same testimony, went out of his way to stress that much of the information in the dossier HAD been vetted and independently corroborated, and that a lot of what Steele compiled was information the FBI already had from multiple credible sources.</p>

<p>Approval of a FISA application requires the court find probable cause that the target of the surveillance be a &quot;foreign power&quot; or an &quot;agent of a foreign power&quot;, and that the places at which surveillance is requested is used or will be used by that foreign power or its agent.[2][19] In addition, the court must find that the proposed surveillance meet certain &quot;minimization requirements&quot; for information pertaining to U.S. persons.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How are you going to list things off as fact, and have your first point be false? I’m sure you’ll follow this up with “did you read the memo?” Ah yes, the memo created by the guy who had to recuse himself from any Russia investigation, and didn’t even read the FISA applications. I find this memo to be barely credible at best. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean, sure, the FBI is allowed to investigate anyone that it has been suggested for up to 5 years that they are cooperating with Intelligence operatives of a foregin government, and are not a member of a political campaign</p>

<p>Your initial premise, that this allows &quot;trump&quot; to do anything assumes literally that obama or Clinton &quot;did this&quot; (i.e. Directed the FBI for personal political gain) while having literally no evidence of this except for the presence of the conspiracy itself.</p>
