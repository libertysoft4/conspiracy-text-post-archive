    <div class="md"><p>He did for a while, then he transferred the detainees to Bagram (now Parwan), then more people were put in Guantanamo. So basically he made it look like he was putting an end to torturing political prisoners, by sending them all to a second Guantanamo under the guise of closing the first, and no one questioned this, and in fact many people still think he closed Guantanamo to this day, but he didn&#39;t. That was the plan, they said they were doing it, then they didn&#39;t do it, and now there&#39;s two of them. We transferred ownership to the Afghanistan government (because they&#39;re such a great band of folks) under the condition that we still maintain heavy oversight over who they are allowed to release. This facility tortures and interrogates the same political prisoners that were at Guantanamo, except now people like Ashraf Ghani were making decisions about how to run the facility. Ashraf is the current president of afghanistan. He graduated is an anthropologist that received his doctorate from Columbia university, and taught at Berkeley and John Hopkins. In the 90&#39;s he worked as an anthropologist lead for The World Bank in the 90&#39;s working on reform programs in east Asian, including in India, China, and Russia. During this time he also received Harvard and Stanford education. This ticks a lot of boxes to anyone well acquainted with the Bretton Woods conspiracy, in particular the IMF, which was founded at the same time as The World Bank, and has been accused of enslaving the third world under inescapable debt.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not to discredit what the other comment said, but Obama did more than just trying to move around prisoners to other sites like Guantanamo.  He did actually make an effort to shut it down, however to do that we needed to move the prisoners to the US and there were zero congressmen/women who wanted that to happen.  No one wanted the detainees in their state.  So basically some in congress wanted to shut it down publicly, but in reality they voted no because they didn&#39;t want them here, or more specifically in their own state potentially.  That was just the democrats too if I remember right, the republicans were voting no just because it was Obama, but I bet they had similar feelings as the democrats.  </p>

<p>So he did try, but got shut down pretty quick.  I don&#39;t know if he could have used an EO for it or not, but doing so would have put him at odds with not only the republican congress, but also with the democrat congress.</p>

<p>Guantanamo is a huge black eye for the US and it is super depressing that Obama was unwilling and unable to make an impact on it, and unfortunately we now have a president that not only wants it open but wants to send more people there.  This is something I feel like the entire US population should be on the same side about, but we are so politicized now that I fear Trump supporters are going to support Guantanamo remaining open which means their representatives will also begin supporting it.</p>

<p>I completely agree with that statement, but just so you, it doesn&#39;t matter where you were born at this point, POTUS just has to say you&#39;re a terrorist and you can be put away indefinitely without trial.

    <div class="md"><p>So we can see that Trump is about the law of the land, with the appointment of judges and not arresting political figures outright. If he did that then he would have looked like a tyrant. So law of the land, that is his mission. </p>

<p>So what does that have to do with gitmo? </p>

<p>I do believe that GITMO was kept open for terrorists, foreign of course but also domestic. It sounds obvious but there are over 13,000 indictments in the docket, these are American, and includes Hillary, Bill, Comey, McCabe and their cronies. </p>

<p>Keeping gitmo open means military court and imprisonment, NOT civilian. Because can you imagine Obama placed liberal judges overlooking Hillary case for example? </p>

<p>did it dawn on you that maybe that&#39;s why he&#39;s there right now?  He was approached by the military to run, probably as a distraction, while this country is being cleaned top to bottom.

<p>Furthermore, I think we&#39;re being told a lot of stuff in the conspiracy world, but at this point it&#39;s a lot of promises and the evidence is patchy at best.  Did they send the cabal to Guantanamo or is it for anyone they don&#39;t like?  When are they disclosing suppressed technologies?

<p>Regardless of whether a person dislikes trump or the people that came before him, we should all be agreeing that the system that got us to where we are now hasn&#39;t been successful in serving the people, and that we need to fix this system in such a way that our government is utilized to serve our will, and this is not something that we can let them fix for us, because letting them set it up has led to it serving them rather than us.</p>
