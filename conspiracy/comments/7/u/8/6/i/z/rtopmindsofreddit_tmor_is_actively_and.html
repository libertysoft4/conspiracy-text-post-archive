        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Perhaps emboldened by the admin&#39;s apparent apathy to behavior that <em>should</em> be considered as going against the core ethos of this website, the stalker/hate sub known as TMOR has significantly increased their attacks against me.</p>

<p>For example, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7u1py5/how_come_washingtons_in_a_rush_to_rig_russias/dtgtyld/">this submission statement of mine</a> from 15 hours ago has managed to achieve an impressive -85 in comment karma. </p>

<p><em>Curiously, the thread never got very popular (it hit 0 fairly quickly) and less than a dozen other users actually commented at all.</em> </p>

<p>For those familiar with reddit, that would <em>not</em> account for almost -100 comment karma, with well over +100 comment karma for the top comment (which was a TMOR-esque ad hominem attack against me).</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TopMindsOfReddit/comments/7u309p/top_mod_goes_full_comrade_and_posts_literal/">Here&#39;s the explanation</a>. Notice how this TMOR thread has <em>significantly</em> more activity than my thread: it&#39;s at 257 points with 46 comments.</p>

<p>IMO this is <em>irrefutable</em> evidence of a TMOR induced/inspired brigade that created a -100/+100 discrepancy in the voting of my post.</p>

<p>In a similar example from today, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7u1n3e/reaction_to_recent_iranian_protests_reveals/dtgudou/?sh=bf98fd55&amp;amp;st=JD290RBE">another comment of mine</a> was downvoted dozens of times <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TopMindsOfReddit/comments/7u5737/top_mod_at_it_again_complains_about_his_blatant/">and it just so happens it was linked</a> by TMOR as well.</p>

<p>And hey look, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TopMindsOfReddit/comments/7u410z/top_mod_posts_political_thread_weeks_after_saying/">they linked to <em>another</em> one of my posts today.</a>.</p>

<p>As of late, TMOR has decided to honor me with multiple links to my posts and comments on their front page on a regular basis (there are at least 4 on their front page right now!). <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TopMindsOfReddit/comments/7t536z/stand_up_to_the_mod_abuse_axolotl_peyotl_sets_a/">Their current sticky</a> is even some sort of perverse call to arms against me.</p>

<p>Scanning through these threads is a fascinating experience...they don&#39;t even know me, and yet it&#39;s palpable how they delight in their obsessive disdain, and all over some person on the internet!</p>

<p>This thread should serve as a good reference point for those who accuse us of spouting baseless accusations against what very clearly is despicable behavior being regularly carried out by hate-oriented subs like TMOR.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Eh, it&#39;s a common enough sort of subreddit. Others dedicated to racism, etc... or to highlighting stupid shit from all sorts of people.</p>

<p>As for conspiracy theorists, there is a broad range and some of them are legitimately mentally ill. Others thing they&#39;re supergeniuses that can see the truth that all those other sheeple miss.

    <div class="md"><p>Individual members may vary in their responses, but for some, yes. You can find those if you dig into the history of the place.</p>

<p>I suppose they might argue it&#39;s not mockery but &quot;highlighting&quot; some of the crazy. Anyway, they and other similar subs pop up on <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> from time to time, if you use that as your front page like I do you&#39;ll see them whenever something extremely highly upvoted is posted.</p>

<p>I do recommend that; if you&#39;re new to reddit you might not know about <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> but it&#39;s what <a href="/r/popular">/r/popular</a> replaced. It gets all sorts of cool stuff from all over reddit (except quarantined subs). A great way to find new subs or just awesome content you would otherwise miss.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve looked at Conspiracy Undone, they have a big problem with calling people shills and then banning them, which is why this subreddit has rule 10. </p>

<p>I managed to get -160 points in just a few hours, with only one posting, so I realized what they are.</p>

<p>They&#39;re the most toxic punk´s I&#39;ve seen on the Internet.</p>

<p>They are only there to celebrate themselves, they do this with so little self awareness that it is painful to read there in a thread.</p>

<p>I can still remember times when Grammar-Nazi were the bottom of society, unfortunately not on Reddit here they have their own page.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m pretty sure that submission statement was so heavily downvoted because you linked to literal Russian propaganda. Not like RT level propaganda, just straight up, obvious and unmasked propaganda. Organic users on this site aren&#39;t stupid and they downvoted you for making such a post. That would be my guess as to what happened. Or, I suppose it could be because everyone is out to get you and wants to keep the &quot;truth&quot; from being known. </p>

<p>I love how there is never an actual response to the actual argument just weak strawmans, ad Hominems, and deflections like &quot;it&#39;s propaganda&quot; or whataboutism. </p>

<p>If it&#39;s propaganda then it should be easy to actually address the point made then right? If you attack me or do any of the arguments I made your proving my point.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know, I actually agree with you that people should address things they disagree. That&#39;s been my stance with the whole &quot;shill&quot; thing here: it shouldn&#39;t matter if people are shills. If their points are bad, argue for why they&#39;re bad. So I agree that people should address the point of an OP most of the time.  </p>

<p>However, I was simply giving an alternative explanation for why OP&#39;s post might have been heavily downvoted. It doesn&#39;t require TMOR brigading or whatever. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>All the time. People downvote and dismiss pretty much all posts from the Washington Post and things considered MSM without addressing the content. Those threads are always filled with comments about how &quot;WaPo is trash&quot; or the like.  </p>

<p>Ditto for RT and zerohedge. People downvote and dismiss.  </p>

<p>I agree that people should address the claims in most cases. There are probably a few exceptions for really obvious bullshit, but even in those cases it makes sense to address the claim and show why it&#39;s wrong.  </p>

<p>But this is different than downvoting. I don&#39;t expect people who hate the Washington Post to upvote posts from the Washington Post. Likewise, I don&#39;t expect people who think RT is propaganda to upvote posts from RT. </p>
