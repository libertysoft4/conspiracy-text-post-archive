        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;ve gone through the thing a few times and tried to note information that appears new to the public. It&#39;s somewhat pointless to mention what the memo neglects to include (the fact that Carter Page was previously considered a target of Russian intel back in &#39;15, for example) so I&#39;ll just stick to what&#39;s actually in here. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Assertion that Steele&#39;s dossier spurred the FISA warrants issued against him. </p></li>
<li><p>Assertion that FISA applications did not mention the fact that DNC/Clinton campaign hired Steele via Fusion (is this required to be included in such a matter?). </p></li>
<li><p>Assertion that the FBI stopped working with Steele because he himself was the second-hand source of two press articles (YahooNews piece of Page&#39;s trip to Moscow, Oct 30 Mother Jones article on the dossier&#39;s existence). Steele appears to have been trying to get the dossier info out in the press, and it appears Nunes&#39; crew in House Intel did not want any of this information out prior to the election. Which would conceivably include the fact that an FBI investigation of the Trump campaign was ongoing at the time.</p></li>
<li><p>Steele continued to work with DOJ official Bruce Orr, who&#39;s wife actually worked with Fusion back then. The lone quote in the memo is from Orr, who claims Steele passionately insisted Trump should not become president. Of course, it doesn&#39;t mention <em>why</em> Steele held this position, which leads the reader to believe it was simply political bias, when it could be based on the fact that Steele was finding out troublesome things through sources and truly believed the Trump campaign was compromised in some way. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>I think that&#39;s it. Lemme know if I missed anything. We can keep hemming and hawing about things we already knew and have debated for months, but this new (although evidence-free) information and assertions are the meat of this memo, and things to consider moving forward. </p>

<p>IIRC the FBI placed microphones in notebooks containing financial documents that the Russians were not supposed to have.  These Russians then had a conversation with the microphone on the table between them and among many items discussed mentioned Carter Page and discussed the possibility of &quot;recruiting him&quot;.    Im not so sure recruiting him means spy shit. they may have wanted him to do a job that wouldn&#39;t be illegal  if Carter was employed to do the same job by an American corporation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He wasn’t even charged with any wrongdoing.</p>

<p>So the man who supposedly has been in bed with the Russians and orchestrated Trump’s victory by way of collusion....had previously helped the FBI catch 3 Russian spies? Why would Russia continue to use, assuming they had successfully recruited Page in 2013, a guy who screwed them and got 3 spies arrested? They can’t simultaneously be masters of espionage and stupid enough to rely on a guy (that screwed them the first chance he got) a second time.</p>

<p>And regardless of what happened in 2013, he’s been surveilled for 12 months and investigated for 15 in the current probe and they’ve turned up nothing on him.</p>

<p>Now I’ll concede perhaps there’s a sealed indictment, but he was on tv with Chris Matthews as recently as October 2017. If he was indicted he’d be barred from publishing anything to the media or appearing on tv to field questions. That was a whole thing with Manafort just a few months ago.</p>

<p>The reality is there’s nothing on Page from the current probe and he’s now confirmed to be the smoking gun. They had 12 months of continuous surveillance and he’s not implicated. That’s not a good look for Trump Russia Collusion.</p>

<p>Now perhaps they picked up leads on others, we know from the memo that’s how Popadopalous was implicated, but he’s only implicated on a process crime so far.</p>

<p>Just the Collusion angle doesn’t look good, that’s all man.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure.  It is the NWO globalists, who happen to be Democrat or Republican.  Just because a member of Congress is a Republican, it does not mean they support Trump.  McCain, for example, is both a Republican and NWO globalist, and he was against Trump.  I hear he has been turned now, for various reasons.  </p>

<p>Trump is more of a Nationalist, who pretends to be a Republican.  It was the only way he had a chance of winning the election.  </p>

<p>This is not a counter argument. Nobody is denying where it started. Where it went <strong>once it was picked up by the DNC/Clinton Campaign</strong> is what matters.

<p>Each subsequent FISA application requires NEW probable cause, so this argument is irrelevant. Each subsequent 90 day re-authorization must rely on a new argument. </p>

<p>They don&#39;t become unimportant, but this omission does show the bias of the memo and casts doubt on further claims below. That, by the way, could have been avoided if Nunes released the underlying information like people called for.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Yes, but the claim is that the Steele dossier was crucial in obtaining these warrants when we know he was being surveillanced as far back as 2014. That means they had additional info to believe Page was a Russian agent. This, too, can be cleared up by releasing redacted versions of the FISA warrants.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Somehow, I think the FBI&#39;s opinion on the matter carries more weight than Steele&#39;s testimony. But you can continue to rely on him if you wish. That&#39;s your mistake to make.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This isn&#39;t the FBI&#39;s opinion, this is Nunes claiming the FBI fired him. I&#39;d say Steele&#39;s testimony carries more weight since by law you are required to tell the truth to Congress.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Uh, yeah? If I had a bias toward electing Hillary Clinton, I damn sure wouldn&#39;t support reopening an investigation and writing a letter to Congress <em>a week</em> before the election. And as I said above, regardless of the Steele dossier, the FBI already had outside information to warrant Page&#39;s surveillance.</p>

<p>We can all agree that the underlying FISA appications should be released, but it is entirely ridiculous to claim that Nunes should have just done that instead. It&#39;s such a manipulation to argue that. </p>

<p>How much resistance has there been from people worried about &quot;national security&quot;? Now it is obvious that nothing in this memo comprimises national security. Do you really think the FISA applications would just be released without noise? It would be so much harder to get people on board. </p>

<p>Now, the public will be DEMANDING that the applications will be released. This is purposeful. This is the first strike in what will be more to come. </p>

<p>The Senate has a similar memo, and the IG report will be released soon as well. You can continue to shout into the wind if you would like. </p>

FBI: Tap/collect everything for a year!</p>

<p>Granted the memo needs to be corroborated, but the names are actually out there. It couldn’t be easier for journalists to start acting direct and difficult questions to the individuals/entities that have this information.</p>

<p>If this material is true it should finally start to be substantiated by actual documentation and on the record testimony.</p>

<p>Hopefully this stops the battle of anonymous sources giving their version of the story.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So the goal of the memo is to prove deep state levels of corruption. Which I mean is like C- level of evidence. I just was expecting a little more. This might be a small step to Seth Rich, but it also seems shallow. Easily malleable, and over all even a little over dramatic... </p>

<p>That, by the way, could have been avoided if Nunes released the underlying information like people called for.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We can all agree that the underlying FISA appications should be released, but it is entirely ridiculous to claim that Nunes should have just done that instead. It&#39;s such a manipulation to argue that. </p>

<p>How much resistance has there been from people worried about &quot;national security&quot;? Now it is obvious that nothing in this memo comprimises national security. Do you really think the FISA applications would just be released without noise? It would be so much harder to get people on board. </p>

<p>Now, the public will be DEMANDING that the applications will be released. This is purposeful. This is the first strike in what will be more to come. </p>

<p>The Senate has a similar memo, and the IG report will be released soon as well. You can continue to shout into the wind if you would like. </p>

<p>Can you provide insight into what has been corroborated, and when? Because that doesnt jive with Comey testifying that the information was &quot;salacious and unverified in June 2017&quot;. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>What information do you believe they admitted &quot;repeatedly and knowingly&quot; on the FISA applications? What evidence do you have that they did?</p>

<p>The word is <em>omitted</em>, and if you actually read the memo it describes that information. You can certainly argue against the memo if you&#39;d like. It is not my information. </p>
