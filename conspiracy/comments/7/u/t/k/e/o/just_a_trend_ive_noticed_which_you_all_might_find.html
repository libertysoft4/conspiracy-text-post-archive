    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s not what OP says at all. You are pushing the mainstream if you&#39;re <em>actually</em> pushing it...posting, defending, and spreading the Corporate Media Propaganda, not to show it for what it is, but because you believe it. OP is saying that a lot of people who only support the MSM narrative and act quite...shilly...tend to post in a sports sub now and then to give them legitimacy.</p>

<p>This makes sense- they are learning. When the shills first started heavily inundating this forum and others (it has been going on for years but really took off in 2015/16), they were painfully obvious- 3 day old accounts with nothing but talking points spouted wherever they were directed...now these 3 day old accounts have matured, and the new ones also make sure to post in these subs. This is because in the early days, this was a key tell, and this information was spread by the Real Ones on this site as a means of pointing them out...so they adapted.</p>

Sports are the only thing that keep me sane in this fucked up world we know about due to conspiracies, and now people discredit us just for liking sports? I bet my views are too &quot;out there&quot; for even OP, while being a sports junkie. People constantly falling for any and every divide and conquer tactic out there. While simultaneously not using any critical thinking or context to see who real shills and trolls are.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Haha I always participate in sports discussions and I am constantly getting downvoted for going against the public accepted opinion here. I hardly even comment here anymore because of the close minded discussion. However I dont talk in politics subs so thats how I am different from what you are describing. Either way, you shouldnt paint with such a broad stroke and assume so many things. Use context with your thinking, dont just use labels. I do agree with your main point, shills are here all the time and they do post in general common subs to seem like an average person. You need to read between the lines though</p>
