<p>Any ideas on what this could be? It only happens whenever I pull into my driveway late at night and only on the channel I use for my Bluetooth adapter that I use to play music since I don&#39;t have a cassette player or aux cord that folks normally use. I&#39;m only posting this here as my grandfather on my dad&#39;s side was watched by government agents before due to his stance on taxes and my father has caught agents going through his car and walking into his home before when he was younger. Could this be the signal coming from an audio bug that is transmitting what it has recorded during the day late at night in order to avoid detection? Or is it just interference of some kind?</p>

<p>I think the feds were looking into my dad and uncle since my uncle had a previous gun conviction he went to prison for. They were both not doing anything illegal, my dad never has, and my uncle actually turned his life around.</p>

<p>Since my uncle would come over often, I think they would listen in on our house phone. Maybe even through our computer. Every time my uncle would come around that noise would come from our PC speakers or the house phone speaker.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We actually just had a weird incident where two people pulled into our driveway behind my sister who was on here phone with the car off so they didn&#39;t realize she was there. One of them, a woman, got out of the car before realizing my sister was in her car which then prompted her to bizarrely go back to their car and hide underneath it. It was at that point my sister called me and asked me to help but I was at a friend&#39;s watching the college football championship, I nearly rolled out with my friends then and there but my dad ended up coming outside which scared them off.

<p>You&#39;re starting from:  <em>I&#39;m only posting this here as my grandfather on my dad&#39;s side was watched</em></p>

<p>Did you witness it?  Unless you grew up with your grandfather in the same town, there&#39;s a lot of context missing.  People scream about the loss of &quot;small town america&quot; yet cannot name their second cousins.  The world went from a horse to the moon in less than two generations.  No government is searching for your grandpop&#39;s descendants. Although if he <em>really</em> fucked up the transgression could be passed to kin. </p>

That&#39;s not the point though, my family has a history of getting on the feds bad side and I think the digging I did into some declassified CIA documents in an effort to get interviews with the authors could have attracted some interest.</p>

<p>You can&#39;t be that far away, we can see the garage door and ANOTHER car in your video.   Plenty of possible sources of interference.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well yeah including my car there&#39;s 4 vehicles in the driveway, but everything is turned off. Why would turned off cars be giving off a signal in the bluetooth band? And I mentioned that it&#39;s not the door opener since I&#39;ve been in other driveways with the same equipment and not heard this sound. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The real conspiracy is... why would someone put a garage at &quot;the very end of the driveway&quot;,  you have to walk from the garage all the way down the drive to the house :-D</p>

<p>Based on all your other replies you clearly <em>want</em> to believe this, so there&#39;s no point trying to reason with you. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>When there is no actual audio (e.g music, whatever) interference sounds become much more obvious because they get amplified more.   </p>

<p>In your case, you have a BT transmitter that undoubtably has <em>some</em> noise in it&#39;s circuitry and your car radio is trying to amplify that.</p>

<p>Could also be interference from car garage opener, cellphone, that white car next to yours etc...    </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well that&#39;s the thing it drowns out the actual audio when I play any which isn&#39;t the case for the normal soft static I hear when I&#39;m not in the driveway. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a garage door opener since if it was I would hear this noise whenever I have to move my car to let my brother leave and pull into another house&#39;s driveway. Since I live on a road where all the houses were built the same way by the same rental people the noise should still be there, but isn&#39;t. As for cellphone if that was the cause my phone would be making this happen all the time, and that doesn&#39;t happen. There&#39;s also nothing I&#39;m aware of in any of my family&#39;s other vehicles that would be causing this let alone turned on at 1:00 AM.</p>
