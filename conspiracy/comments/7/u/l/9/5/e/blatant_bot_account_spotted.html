But I wanted to show it to everyone and get their opinions on it because it&#39;s pretty interesting. It posts all over the place. </p>

<p>It basically all started in a comment I posted:
Not a bad idea actually. Regardless of where you ...</p>

<p>Man. You see bot and shill accusations all the time. When you actually see one face to face in real life and in real time. Wow. I always thought the bot thing was kinda over-hyped. Over blown.... I had never seen just how sophisticated they can be. </p>

<p>Im not tech savvy, so pardon my ignorance. But had the other user never brought it up and had it not been my own fucking comment, I would have upvoted this bot and been like, no way it&#39;s a bot. Seems like a rational enough comment.</p>

<p>I always assumed bots were the flamers. They intentionally made super ridiculous, trollish comments. This one seems like just an ordinary person with a mildly controversial comment.</p>

<p>But if you look at the other comments it copy/pasted, they&#39;re even more innocuous.</p>

<p>There&#39;s been a surge in this kind of bot lately. </p>

<p>Karma farmers usually only do a few posts a day on each account. 
I suspect this is one person trying out their bot script.</p>

<p>I think this was their first attempt: u/karadzic95 (shadow banned)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t be sure. But I and some other users have collected a list of users engaging in the same exact behavior of copy/pasting comments all over Reddit. The list can be found in the text of this post, as well as in comments here.</p>

<p>Unusual behavior suggests these accounts are bots. For one, this post and previous posts stirred up an army of people who have dug deeper into the users profile and replied to its other comments, asking why it&#39;s botting and outright accusing them of being bots.</p>

<p>Not once have any of the accounts replied. It seems like they&#39;re only programmed to post, not reply. No matter how antagonizing other users can be to it. Not once have the accounts even whispered a response. It&#39;s as if they&#39;re not there at all. Nevertheless, we can all see they&#39;re active and continuing to post copy/pasted comments around various subreddits.</p>

<p>This is highly unusualy behavior. We can never be 100% sure they&#39;re bots. But it&#39;s a reasonable conclusion given the facts. I encourage you to investigate more yourself and see. </p>
