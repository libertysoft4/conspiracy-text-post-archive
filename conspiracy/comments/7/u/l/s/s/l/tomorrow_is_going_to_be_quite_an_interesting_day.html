        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I have noticed an abnormally large amount of noise attempting to smear the content of the upcoming memo before its released, which lead me to believe it was going to be something that would shake this Republic to its very core.</p>

<p>But today, it seems even outlets like the BBC have been forced to come to terms with the fact that there is about to be open revolt by members of Congress (and even the President himself) if it is indeed true that <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-42910377">a domestic political campaign was spied on by intelligence agencies</a>.</p>

<p>What is perhaps most fascinating about the entire situation is that if Republicans in Congress become disillusioned and angered over the actions of the intelligence community, it then becomes entirely possible that they would refuse to support a vote for impeachment were Trump to fire Muller. </p>

<p>One would imagine that these kind of programs have no bounds, but many in Congress no doubt feel that campaigns (including their own!) should be sacred in some sense. </p>

<p>Now that there is impending confirmation that domestic intelligence agencies not only spied on a political campaign, but did so by way of manipulating a rubber stamp FISA court with a lie related to the origin of certain evidence in the case, one wonders if this might be one fight that the intelligence agencies are unable to win by way of their stranglehold over conventional media outlets.</p>

<p>In almost every possible way this Republic is being put to the test, and I don&#39;t know how far the checks and balances can bend before the entire house of cards begins to collapse.</p>

<p>This could be quite a wild few weeks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t really see them as mutually exclusive, it is entirely possible that Trump engaged in collusion and that the Intelligence Community abused 702 programs domestically in order to spy on a political campaign.</p>

<p>My insight in the OP is only that were such spying to occur, the saftey net preventing Muller from being fired (the Republicans supporting impeachment if that were to happen) would cease to exist.</p>

<p>In that way, its not that the investigation would get dismantled or that Trump would be ehonroated...its simply that Muller would be fired and the Republicans would then refuse to support impeachment. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t necessarily like the state of real politik in relation to this issue, I am only explaining it from my perspective.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you are essentially saying that if Muller finds that Trump obstructed justice that he is not going to be held accountable for it?  Is that right?</p>

<p>But if Trump <em>did</em> engage in collusion, isn&#39;t that the entire basis for using 702?  It&#39;s about collecting on US persons that are in association with foreign surveillance targets.  So that really wouldn&#39;t be abuse?</p>

<p><strong>If</strong> that is the case, then the real conspiracy is this memo being used as a coverup to hide potentially one of the greatest crime ever committed by a President.</p>

<p>Arguably, the opposite is true as well.  If Trump didn&#39;t collude and 702 was used abusively, then Obama committed one of the greatest crimes by a President.</p>

<p>Considering the timing of this memo, it leads to a certain conclusion however.  Trump has been President for over a year now.  Why is the abuses of FISA only <em>now</em> being revealed?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The biggest shit show would be if both were true. Lets say that people in the Trump campaign colluded with the Russians, maybe even the Mercers. The FBI catches them by using illegal surveillance methods. In order to make the evidence legal, the FBI lies to the FISA courts and maybe even manufactures some evidence.</p>

<p>So basically FBI does something illegal in order to catch Trumps campaign doing something illegal. Now that would be a shit show. </p>

<p>Nope, you failed at every point.</p>

<p>A Republican presidential candidate makes unfounded claims of being wiretapped. </p>

<p>Already admitted that his campaign manager was wiretapped while staying and Trump tower. You fail even without the disclosure of the contents of the memo.</p>

<p>The investigation that has only led to convictions of Republicans is now biased. You just said that.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Doesn&#39;t have anything to do with partisanship. You just made that up because you don&#39;t have anything else to attack him with. He&#39;s a member of the Intelligence Committee. In other words, it&#39;s his job to know this stuff, and you have no idea what you&#39;re talking about.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And, somehow, this unvetted document is supposed to protect the president and dismantle the year-long methodical investigation? </p>

<p>Implying that I can&#39;t be trusted because I&#39;m partisan. I have only talked about facts that can be verified. You, on the other hand, have demonstrably lied <em>and</em> demonstrated significant Trump Derangement Syndrome, as evidenced by your inability to be objective about anything related to Donald Trump. You are the partisan, you argue like a disruptive troll, and I have no more time for your bullshit.</p>

<p>Yes, down party lines every Republican thinks the document drafted by a partisan Republican is accueate, but doesn&#39;t want to show the public the documents they draw that conclusion from or the opposing sides view.

<p>Yes, he was. Trump Tower was wiretapped, and the NSA director Admiral Rogers had to tell Trump that, which caused him to immediately move his operation. They also wiretapped the White House, which is why there were <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/aug/5/white-house-renovations-begin-trump-starts-17-day-/">renovations</a> done to remove them when they were detected.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Read the memo. The reason was a deliberately falsified document from a known partisan paid for with campaign money from his opponent in the 2016 presidential election.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t have much meaning, and is irrelevant. This is basic logic, ad hominem. Attacking the speaker doesn&#39;t refute their claim.</p>

<p>You&#39;re referring to Nunes, yes? The man who ran out of an uber in the middle of the night so he could inform the President on the investigation? Yeah. That&#39;s totally the type of thing I expect from the unbiased head of the committee on the investigation. Oh, and let&#39;s not forget that his own republican colleagues admit he invented the unmasking drama. <em>And</em> he just admitted to editing sections of the memo <em>after</em> it was voted on and before it was sent to the President for review. In other words, he lied to the committee and sent the President a document that they did not agree to send.</p>

<p>But his claims were not unfounded. The Nunes memo is based on a report by Admiral Rogers (performed March 2017) that reportedly details the wiretapping. Rogers reported this to Trump in August 2017. We just don&#39;t know the details of either the report or memo yet.</p>

<p>now i wish they&#39;d bring the blue laws back. it doesn&#39;t have to be sunday. odins day works for me. right smack dab in  the middle of the week.</p>

<p>after irma in sept i was out of power for about 6 days and ATT and comcast were out for almost a month. other than the heat and humidity that made it feel like the 7th rung of hell, i really liked how quiet it was. how dark it would get. people strolling around at night with flashlights just to get out of the house. not having internet or tv for three weeks showed me how evil the internet and tv are. if i could have had the air conditioner, it would almost have been pleasant.</p>

<p>Life was far more spontaneous and lively with many choices made on the spot and on the spur of the moment. Far happier when they worked out and far more accepting and willing to shrug them off and try something completely different when they didn&#39;t. </p>

<p>More direct face to face and impromptu meetings and conversations with other human beings simply as a matter of course. A more homogenous view of ourselves and our society because it actually was far more homogenous and far less fragmented, divided, and contentious than it is now. </p>

<p>Moreover we did get things done and actually were more inventive and creative as matter of necessity. If there was more or better information we lacked we didn&#39;t have the time it would take to track it down and find it.

<p>This is false CIA propaganda. There <em>is no evidence</em> to support the FISA warrant, because the only &quot;Russian collusion&quot; that happened was under the Obama administration with Uranium One et. al.</p>

<p>No, I&#39;m saying it&#39;s objectively false because it doesn&#39;t exist and the &quot;intelligence sources&quot; have already been revealed to have actively fabricated stories about the president in order to keep him out of office, or undermine him.</p>

<p>That&#39;s not illegal, and Hillary Clinton did the <em>exact</em> same thing, except worse. She paid a British intelligence agent, Steele, to craft a document to not only discredit her opponent, but to justify wiretapping him.</p>

<p>Same can be said for the Steele Dossier. Were you whining about that, huh?</p>

<p>It&#39;s funny to me that Democrats are freaking out over this memo and are making the same arguments that correlate to why the Steele Dossier should never have been leaked and published, but then again those in Congress actually leaked it to the press.</p>

<p>Prove me wrong. Nothing is truly stopping anyone from creating and releasing that memo. Republicans are in control of the intelligence committee involved and they had a procedural vote to release the Nunes memo but they didn&#39;t have to do that vote in order to release it. Just like Feinstein releasing the Fusion GPS transcripts wasn&#39;t illegal but it went against the Republicans.</p>

<p>Again, prove it. Schiff and others can leak it whenever they want to but they are holding back because the Republicans &quot;blocked them&quot;, which is BS and you parrot the official Democrat line like it&#39;s actually real.</p>

<p>Are we going to play this game? Really? Why aren&#39;t unverified accusations by a third party that was paid by the Clinton campaign through Fusion GPS—whose founder actually met with the Trump Tower Russian lawyer the day <em>before</em> and <em>after</em> the Trump Tower meeting with Don Jr—similar to a memo who Democrats claim is partisan and unverified and comes from a former member of the Trump transition team (Nunes)? O come on. The same claims that Republicans lobbied at the Dossier are the same claims Democrats are making to stop the release of this memo. You can&#39;t put 2 + 2 together? Okay.....</p>

<p>This part frustrates me. Not only do the politicians feel this way but so do their most rabid supporters. If you supported Obama when he was running you probably thought the birth certificate scandal was offensive. If you supported Trump you maybe though he had a right to keep his tax returns private. Why? I understand the tabloid-esque nature of the news coverage can seem offensive, but why should someone running g for public office not be thoroughly scrutinized? Serious backgrounds checks and disclosures should be the norm. Maybe they should have to pass some sort of poly-graph or enhanced interrogation (after all it&#39;s not torture, just information gathering, doesn&#39;t hurt). I live close to Seattle where Mayor Ed Murray just resigned under the cloud of a pretty horrific scandal. How the background info on him didn&#39;t come to light years ago is baffling. A simple background investigation would have yielded the info needed to disqualify him from office. </p>

<p>That&#39;s because collusion isn&#39;t a crime - it doesn&#39;t indicate criminality in and of itself. It&#39;s really just a branding of the investigation to discover if Trump did anything nefarious with regard to releasing the DNC emails and affecting the election. It evolved into investigating all sorts of other things along the way as other information became available. There would most certainly be evidence of things like accepting payments from Russia for promises of easing economic sanctions, however.</p>

This is supposed to be a massive overreach of power, kept secret and hidden from the public eye, and intended to stay that way. If its fake, then how could they possibly even know what the memo alleges?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As someone that isn&#39;t fond of Trump or the intelligence community/rampant domestic spying, the question in the back of my mind this whole time is: Should anyone involved in a challenging party&#39;s campaign be immune from any investigations? I feel like that is a dangerous road to go down, but it seems to be a possible conclusion of the argument Trump supporters are making.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem isnt as simple as who watches the watchmen. The issue is theyre running a propaganda campaign (in general that should be a red flag) to discredit the media as well as the branches of government that deal with this. This propaganda campaign should be the target of conspiracy ire. It leads to an empirical cat and mouse game where nobody can investigate the president, the highest and for some reason therefore the least corrupt office in the land. This is false, nobody should be above the law.</p>
