        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The below got me banned with no explanation in 2 hours by the snowflakes at The_Donald.  I wonder if you all are interested in my opinions.</p>

<p>IMHO Obama is a natural born citizen because his mother was a US citizen at the time of his birth and she was in the US at the time and had been for over a year. Spoiler, Obama was not born in Hawaii.</p>

<p>We know that Ann graduated high school in 1960 and we know that Barry&#39;s first schooling was in Indonesia when his father was Soetoro. What isn&#39;t clear is why and when Ann went from Washington state to Indonesia.</p>

<p>I was never interested in the whole BIRTHER thing because honestly I feared Hillary more and Obama was the lesser of 2 evil. (there was no way a republican was going to win in 2008)</p>

<p>Even as a conservative I tried to cover for POTUS Obama but all the evidence was complete crap.</p>

<p>As much as it pained me I had to learn more about Obama...</p>

<p><strong>The Clues</strong> 
1960 Ann graduates from Mercer Island High School in Seattle Area 1960 17 year old Ann is photographed naked by Frank Marshall Davis (51 year old married communist investigated by FBI) </p>

<p>1960 Parents move to the new state of Hawaii. Ann in theory follows and enrolls University of Hawaii at Mānoa. </p>

<p>February 2, 1961 3 month pregnant Ann married Kenyan citizen Barrack Obama in Hawaii. </p>

<p>August 4, 1961, 18 year old Ann give birth to Barry.</p>

<p>September 1961 to June 1962, Ann, a new single mother with a month baby is living in Seattle taking classes at University of Washington. </p>

<p>June 1962 Kenyan Obama moves from Hawaii to Harvard, never spending time with son and wife In Seattle. </p>

<p>September 1962 Ann gets East–West Center grant to study geography at the University of Hawaii. </p>

<p>January 1964 Dunham filed for divorce Because her absent husband already had a wife and child in Kenya </p>

<p>June 1964 Lolo Soetoro graduated from the University of Hawaii with an M.A. in geography </p>

<p>December 1964 Kenyan Obama married Ruth Baker Has 2 sons. (some say he moves back to Kenya) </p>

<p>1965 Ann Marries Lolo Soetoro </p>

<p>1965 Kenyan Obama received a MA in economics from Harvard </p>

<p>1966 Lolo Soetoro moves back to Indonesia </p>

<p>August 6, 1967 Ann graduated from the University of Hawaii with a B.A. in anthropology </p>

<p>October 1967 Ann and future POTUS move to Indonesia live at 16 Kyai Haji Ramli Tengah Street for 2.5 years </p>

<p>1970 Ann, Soetoro and Barry move to 22 Taman Amir Hamzah Street </p>

<p>August 15, 1970 Ann give birth to daughter, Maya Kassandra Soetoro (not a natural born citizen) </p>

<p>1971 Barry is sent to Hawaii to attend Punahou, lives with his &quot;racist&quot; grandparents 1971 Kenyan Obama visits Barry in Hawaii (some say 1968) </p>

<p>August 1972, Ann and her daughter moved back to Hawaii begins graduate study at the University of Hawaii </p>

<p>1973 Kenyan Obama divorcees Ruth Baker </p>

<p>1975 Ann and Maya returned to Indonesia Barry stays in US </p>

<p>November 5, 1980 Ann and Soetoro divorce </p>

<p>1982 Kenyan Obama dies in car crash </p>

<p>March 2, 1987 Soetoro dies of liver failure </p>

<p>July 26, 1987 Frank Marshal Davis dies at 81 January 1988 to 1995, Ann was a consultant funded by USAID and the World Bank. </p>

<p>August 9, 1992, Ann awarded PhD in anthropology from the University of Hawaii </p>

<p>February 8, 1992 Barry&#39;s grandfather dies (aged 73) Early 1995 Ann diagnosed with cancer </p>

<p>November 7, 1995 Ann dies from Cancer November 2, 2008 Barry&#39;s grandmother dies (aged 86)</p>

<p><strong>That said</strong> I have not investigated Any of the above personally. I do find it odd that we have nude photos of Ann but no photos of her newborn son in Hawaii or Washington or where ever she had him. We know addresses in Indonesia where they lived but few other details about where they lived before that. So much information is missing.</p>

<p><strong>My Theory</strong> 
Barry&#39;s biological father was Frank Marshall Davis who supported Ann for a time until she moved to Hawaii.</p>

<p>I have to think Ann&#39;s parents were embarrassed their unwed suburban daughter got knocked and was going to have a black baby. Lets face it, it was the 60s. This would explain them moving to Hawaii of all places where a mixed race child wouldn&#39;t be an issue.</p>

<p>Maybe Barry was born in a doctors office, or hospital or mid wife... Who knows. I also think Ann&#39;s parents put a notice in the Hawaiian paper, because come on, no proof is needed.</p>

<p>I have to wonder if Ann was rebelling against her parents, or didn&#39;t want to leave her friends, or was in love with Frank or had complications that kept her from flying. But for some reason she had Barry in Washington, waited till he was safe to fly and moved to Hawaii and then fabricated the story with Kenyan Obama as cover.</p>

<p>It appears Ann Truly cared about Lolo, Maya, Indonesia, education and socialism, but not Barry.</p>

<p>I wonder if there was some sort of resentment from Lolo and thus Ann because Barry was a bastard child that would have been offensive to muslims in Indonesia.</p>

<p>I think Barry&#39;s secret father is the reason why so much information is missing or contradictory.</p>

<p>I do think Barry Knows who his father is and had some connections with him, maybe learning his radical leftist, anti-america, racist ways from Frank.</p>

<p>Frank Marshall Davis looks just like Barry and Ann was in Seattle with a newborn baby. Why would Ann Fly from Hawaii to Seattle with a newborn.</p>

<p>Obama looks nothing like his Kenyan Obama family.</p>

<p>I do think the Hawaiian Birth Certificate is fraudulent and who ever produced it should be prosecuted. What if the next Radical, Anti American Candidate isn&#39;t really a natural born citizenship. We certainly don&#39;t want people forging documents to subvert the constitutional requirements to be president.</p>

<p>Sadly its highly unlikely that anyone knows the truth, Perhaps the FBI has information but that won&#39;t come out, or will it... MUHAHAHAHAHAHAHA.</p>

<p>I guess we could test the DNA of some Obama&#39;s and Frank Marshall Davis&#39;s relatives and see what matches.
I do think anyone who honestly believes the official story that Barry was born in Hawaii is a moron. 10 seconds of searching makes it fairly obvious Ann was not getting jiggy in Hawaii with a random exchange student 9 months before Barry&#39;s birth.</p>

<p>I also respect all the Birther that knew something wasn&#39;t right. Don&#39;t get me wrong in polite company I will reply that Obama was not born in Kenya and he was born in the USA. But I will never lie and say he was born in Hawaii.
Sorry for all the typos and horrible grammar. If anyone shows interest I will spend some time fixing them</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Read the OP. I believe she was in Washington going to school. </p>

<p>What I don&#39;t believe is she went to Hawaii, enrolled in college, met,  impregnated by and then marries a stranger. Then leave your family, college and new husband to goto a different school alone in Seattle with a 2 month old... All in 16 months. </p>

<p>Isn&#39;t it more likely she stayed in Seattle having an affair with a married man who had naked pictures of Ann and looks Barry. </p>

<p>And then later Ann moves to Hawaii to be with her parents? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As I said before the lack of an authentic Hawaiian birth certificate is a clue.  I can&#39;t make you look into it, nor do I want to distract from the main point of the thread.  The man that took and shared naked pictures of Ann, also looks very much like Obama and was actually in the city where Ann was actually seen with her newborn baby.  Sure its possible Frank is still the father but an went to Hawaii had Barry then flew immediately back to Washington.  I concluded she was in Washington the whole time because it is the most plausible explanation. If you genuinely wonder if the Hawaiian Birth certificate is real, then I suggest you look into it, thousand of experienced people have researched it and found many abnormalities that have never been explained.  </p>

<p>If you don&#39;t wonder if the Hawaiian birth certificate is real... Then you already believe he is naturally born so I have to ask why are you posting?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Based on all the people who have investigated it..... NO.... Again it doesn&#39;t really matter.  If you care about the fake Birth Certificate go to a thread about that.  This thread is not disputing the fakeness of the birth certificate. It is only giving a reasonale conclusion based on what we are told and what actual evicence exists.  Mind you I first researched all this in 2008 and researched it more in 2010. Since that time a DVD has been made &quot;Dreams of my real father&quot; I guess you could watch that.  I might buy it and watch it on an old laptop that has a DVD drive.  </p>

<p>Do you know many people?  People aren&#39;t logical.  I know people who proposed on a second date (and they&#39;re still married years later). I know people who just dropped out of good schools or quit good jobs for no good reason.  People move across the world because they met someone on an online game.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have clues that lead to a logical conclusion.  When did I ever say I had proof?  By all means if you have DNA Of Barry or his kids, i am sure we can find a relative of Kenyan Obama that would glady give a DNA sample. </p>

<p>I&#39;m offering up my conclusion, if you actually have a reason to believe my conclusions are less valid then the official story then by all means share it.  </p>

<p>Does Barry look like Frank or Kenyan Obama? </p>

<p>Did you do more than one minute of research?  Obama&#39;s mother was an anthropologist (eventually getting her PhD) who specialized in Indonesia and later did microfinance there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>you would have to ask the person who forged it.  The cover ups is usually greater then the initial lie.  The logical thing would be for Obama to admit everything he was told and told others was a lie.... But the easier thing is to do a really bad job forging a document that in theory should not have existed and then upload it to the world.</p>
