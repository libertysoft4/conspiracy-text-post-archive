<p>At a February hearing held by the Louisiana Department of Natural Resources, TigerSwan advisory board chair James “Spider” Marks, a retired U.S. Army major general, spoke in favor of building the pipeline — without revealing his association with TigerSwan. He also published an op-ed in the Lafayette Daily Advertiser newspaper decrying the “anti-energy agitators” who oppose the project.</p>

<p>“No Louisianan wants to live under the conditions that those unsuspecting North Dakota residents were subject to — with protesters trespassing, interrupting the local flow of traffic, and generally injecting elements of fear and the unknown into their daily lives,” Marks wrote. “A timely approval process of the Bayou Bridge Pipeline, however, would prevent the possibility of such conditions arising in this state.”</p>

<p>In May, Marks wrote another opinion piece that failed to disclose his TigerSwan affiliation, this time for the Pennsylvania news site PennLive, warning readers there to “be wary of professional pipeline protesters” who turned Standing Rock into a scene of “hapless violence and bloodshed.”</p>

<p>“Many of the same professional agitators who fomented chaos in North Dakota are turning their efforts to the Mariner East II Pipeline in Pennsylvania,” Marks wrote. “These orchestrators make no qualms about their intent to turn Camp White Pine — a small but growing protest area in Huntingdon County — into the next national showdown.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s all that scandalous either in terms of obligations to disclose. Although for someone of his stature to write an opinion piece, submit it to the publication process and have it come out in print, without either himself or the people publishing down the line from him not pointing out that it&#39;s bad form for Marks not to disclose, seems damn near impossible. Ironic cause I bet he and his peeps think they&#39;re real pros at the media game, subtly inserting psy-ops tactics into run of opinion pieces and not realizing their amature night bullshit does more harm than good. Like the internet isn&#39;t gonna piece that crap together and call him out on it.  Frankly, im surprised they didn&#39;t just put it out there or ask someone less obvious to claim authorship.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do not particularly care about details being taken out of context. The article seems to support upgrading of existing and aging pipelines. The country is crisscrossed with pipelines many of which are in need of upgrade. Oddly the other 72000 miles of pipeline are not mentioned while we endlessly debate one small 400 mile section being developed with the most modern safety features. Meanwhile I would submit that the alleged 5K Vets may have difused the situation, but more for PR than fear.</p>
