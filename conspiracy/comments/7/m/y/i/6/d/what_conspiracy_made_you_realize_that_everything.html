<p>They actually pulled building 7 to make it look obvious on purpose. To terrorize those who are paying attention, and to seed fear into the sheep.</p>

<p>Everyone knows something is fucked up, its the fear of everything they would have to admit if they had to admit to that, just incredible.
Control through fear, masterful.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Man, where to begin.. haha</p>

<p>I would first watch the 30 second video of building 7 falling, until you fully understand that it is a classic controlled demolition.</p>

<p>The building falls at -9.8 meters per second, the speed of gravity, this cannot occur unless all resistance had been removed underneath it. Which is obviously not possible through fire alone (official story)</p>

<p>And that is where the rabbit hole begins... it goes really deep, explore at your own risk.</p>

<p>look up videos by &quot;architects and engineers for 9/11 truth&quot;</p>

<p>This is a pretty generic one: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqqelDq4P48">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqqelDq4P48</a></p>

<p>And finally, the conclusion, which I was only able to accept after seeing almost every single video, lecture, or post on the subject... this is as close as I have gotten to the truth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Evolution as a concept occurs, evolution as the narrative they provide us make no sense at all.</p>

<p>Be real for a second, it take millions upon millions of year to evolve species, not to mention one as developed as humans.</p>

<p>The narrative says we evolved over a &quot;few hundred thousand years&quot;</p>

<p>Talk about something that makes you question everything...</p>

<p>So evolution went from something that was set in stone to me to something that is a crux argument for &quot;The big lie&quot;</p>

<p>Humans are something special, and if it was purely evolution that made us, it sure as hell took WAY longer than they are telling us. I personally think genetic modification came in at some point.</p>

<p>Like I said, it takes years to decondition yourself, I myself am a scientist so it was especially hard for me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>1) Clear day when footage is initially shown of WTC &#39;attack&#39;. One problem live cgi isn&#39;t as great back then so they have to cover some errors/oops moments with the &#39;planes&#39;. Suddenly all footage later in the day shows a yellow thick hazy day before the planes hit the towers. Suddenly all footage has the same haze. </p>

<p>Luckily youtube has tons of people who noticed it &amp; uploaded it. The point is the low contrast haze covers some of the flight angle problems that are readily evident when you compare different angles. In two angles you literally see an aluminum plane enter one side of a iron clad building &amp; exit front end intact from the other side.</p>

<p>Did you recently see the plane that hit the bird by nose cone recently?
It was totally demolished. Somehow physics didn&#39;t work with the nosecone of the plane that went through iron girders &amp; mesh &amp; exited intact on 9/11.</p>

<p>2) Tons of firefighter interview videos where they state they heard explosions from floor to floor &#39;just like it was a controlled demolition&#39;.</p>

<p>3) Street interviews with bystanders stating it sounded like repetitive even explosions like a demolition.</p>

<p>4) BBC broadcaster live on the scene via satellite announces to anchor in London That Building 7 had come down just minutes ago....this is while Bldg &amp; can be seen standing right behind her in the live shot with the time
stamp in the shot. Unfortunately Bldg 7 was still standing behind her and didn&#39;t fall for several more minutes. That live feed somehow had a satellite feed go to static while the anchor tells the audience somehow they lost the live feed. This video is also on Youtube.</p>

<p>5) Shanksville crash has virtually NO PLANE WRECKAGE when it hits the ground. Sorry the solid earth does not just vaporize aluminum wreckage.</p>

<p>6) All flight videos are confiscated surrounding the surveilled building on earth The Pentagon &amp; all that is released is a video with frames missing of something hitting the Pentagon. Later interviews with federal &amp; state employees where the interviewer asks them individually &amp; separately to draw the flight path as they could recall it......which they do. When you compare every single drawn path it is exactly the same BUT totally different than the &#39;official&#39; flight path released by the government. In fact several state &amp; federal employees state on video that they saw the plane approach the Pentagon &amp; fly low, up &amp; over the building. That sounds like a missile delivery &amp; not a crash. </p>

<p>The Pentagon has photographs where the hole is initially very small in the side of the building but eventually the press shows the Pentagon with a much bigger hole in the side of it. Again minimal &#39;wreckage&#39; probably placed at the site.</p>

<p>You even have mainstream press remarking just after on video that it doesn&#39;t look like a plane crash at all but more like a missile.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>911 and the Iraq war. Boy was I an angry person. I went to Iraq. Lost a few friends. Knowing they died for a lie pissed me off. Hey I joined the army knowing I could have to do some stupid shit at the direction of the government. Id have fought in Iraq for oil if they had been honest. When I was 18 I was deeply patriotic. Like most people that were in high school or grown on 911 the period after was hugely nationalistic. </p>

<p>But being lied to. And the shot I did because of that lie. And my close friends mom dying less than a year after her son bc she was so depressed she couldn&#39;t take care of herself...no I&#39;m a pretty angry individual at that </p>

<p>I don&#39;t even think it was about oil. I think it was dubya wanting to one up hid dad and help Cheney&#39;s buds (krb..haliburton) get rich</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel like few people have thorougly run the scenario in their head. </p>

<p>Try to find the flaw. Don&#39;t nitpick. Find the crucial breaking point in reasoning here that fundamentally breaks this analysis.</p>

<p>A) No one would pay <em>income tax</em> if they had the free choice
B) Bitcoin can only be stopped if all computers are made illegal or the internet is turned off forever
C) There is no way to collect income tax via Bitcoin <em>aside</em> from using the threat of violence.
D) The threat of violence / taxman / prisons / police are all paid for in USD / Euros / other forms of fiat
E) Bitcoin slowly inches forward and gets closer to market cap of USD / fiat every month.
F) As more people use Bitcoin government oppression strikes. Bitcoin is deemed illegal for whatever reason.
G) This continued oppression costs a <strong>lot</strong> of money. Threats of violence need to get paid. Yet government find themselves having less and less money every money coming in as more and more people start using Bitcoin. Why? Because the risk of getting caught is not that great.
H) This vicious cycle continous until government barely has any money to fund its muderous goons.
I) Government inevitably decreases massively.
J) Dollar virtually ends.
K) Bitcoin is officially declared world currency by the shells of what we now call &quot;countries.&quot;</p>

<p>Price is actually irrelevant, though I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;ll be 50-80k 2018, 250k 2019, 1,5 million 2020. I could be off by a little, though.</p>

One night, I was home alone and asked my grandparents to give me a sign to prove she&#39;s not crazy. I was on the patio all alone in the dark. Suddenly, the light we had up in a tree came on all by itself. It was one of those lights that makes a buzzing sound and my grandparents had them in their backyard when I was young. It always made me think of them when I heard it. The light switch was inside, so I opened the door, confirmed I was all alone, and switched it back off. That was my sign, my proof. After that, I became increasingly more aware. Any doubt in your mind will block it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I got interested in aliens first, then came various elite and secret society agendas and string pulling. Somewhere in all that came the moon landings. I still believed in aliens, just that we faked everything until we got real alien technology. I held that belief up until a couple of months ago.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t get a real fear, or life changing/ paradigm changing culture shock on the level of, &quot;everything I thought may be wrong...&quot; Until a friend introduced me to the flat earth theory.</p>

<p>He wasn&#39;t, and still isn&#39;t an official flat earther either (he&#39;d fall under simulation theory) but was fascinated by it, and told me I should look into it. I laughed in his face, and he nodded, and said he laughed too, at first. I called it, &quot;a last chance, all or nothing in, hail Mary pass by the church to cover up alien origins.&quot; </p>

<p>I&#39;m still trying to debunk it, to get my space travel back. I&#39;m trying to find a way to make it all work, and everything tie together.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry to hit you with a novel of a reply. At the moment I&#39;m leaning towards us living in a simulation/matrix that happens to be a flat plane. Physics works and moves according to how, &quot; the architect/programmer/creator&quot; designed it, and the Sun and moon are just luminaries that move accordingly to how the creator wants. They rise and fall however is desired just like in any other video game land. Everything just runs program, until the programmer changes the program.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In summer camp I had this friend who was Native American who would always say super cryptic lines of info that would completely snag into my subconscious and I would repeat them over and over because they were what seemed like common sense but I never thought about it until he would pop off with one I could not wrap my mind around it but they would always stick. Stuff like “don’t ever sign anything you didn’t write yourself” and shit about smallpox blankets and stuff about how everything was all a lie everything from the very beginning some wild stuff about ant people and inner Earth cities that would always seem cool but became a little cartoony But the one that got me was his tribe was  “The Principal People” or the “First People” or The True Cherokee People like before the Indian removal act and the soldiers were raping and murdering entire generations of Cherokee just to feed their Adrenachrome dependency. But the real pure Cherokee are not Native American Indians but actually one of the Lost Tribes of Israel. Truly the children of God. Then I found Rabbi Marvin Tokayer, some Jewish historian who says that Cherokee’s are descendants of Northern Israel&#39;s seafaring tribes, Dan and Zevulun. A lot of their monotheistic views and beliefs and even a lot of their cultural interpretation of little things like braided hair and fringe on their clothing to some bigger things like  written and spoken ancient Hebrew in North America predating “colonization” <em>coughGENOCIDEcough</em> even flat earth ties into it with their belief in there being a sky bridge and windows into heaven. Definitely a Pandora’s box of disinformation that’s only made me more “woke” and it still openly taught as “factual history” </p>

    <div class="md"><p>DNC primary rigging. I knew the US political system was corrupt, but I didn&#39;t know it was <em>that</em> corrupt. And perhaps more importantly, the way that they <em>aggressively</em> smeared everyone who noticed as a &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot;, and buried the story in the MSM despite the overwhelming evidence, made me realize I&#39;d need to take a closer look at basically everything else I&#39;d ever seen aggressively smeared and marginalized as a mere &quot;conspiracy theory&quot;.

<p>Bernie&#39;s ideas sounded good idealistically, but would be almost impossible to implement because of the depth of corruption in our government. Also bernie wasn&#39;t as genuine as I thought, and he was weak enough to be manipulated into toeing the party line. Whether he was threatened or not, he gave into to the Clinton machine. That means he would&#39;ve been a week ass president just like we&#39;ve had for like 30 years. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I find it interesting that as much as I found the DNC primary rigging totally disgusting. </p>

<p>I remember my great grandfather saying that back after the great depression there was a huge uprising of people who started to identify as socialists because they felt the rich blew up the economy &amp; working people were left with nothing....plus people who had silver &amp; gold were required to give it up. Evidently it became illegal to hold onto it.</p>

<p>He would tell us that the govt actively worked to destroy those peoples lives via job harassment &amp; eventually McCarthyism.</p>

<p>I feel bad because I never really paid attention back then. Those who don&#39;t know history are doomed to repeat it?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For me, because of my age it went like this:
&quot;I did not have sexual relations with that woman.&quot; The first president I was old enough to listen to and understand- lied.</p>

<p>Then, the news media, &quot;experts&quot; and every adult in general freaked over Y2K. It was supposed to be a big deal and it ended up being nothing.</p>

<p>Then 9/11.</p>

<p>Iraq. Weapons of Mass Destruction.</p>

<p>Then, the financial crash of 2008 and the bailouts.</p>

<p>And that all lead me to 2016: DNC rigged election/Wikileaks/Pizzagate/Soros etc...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For me it was sandy hook. I was 28 and had never thought of owning a gun, politics, or the goverment in general. 1 year prior to sandy hook i started a new job and got paired up working with an older guy that no one wanted to work with because all he did is talk about politcs, which really didn&#39;t bug me. After nearly a year of listening to him go on about the government taking our guns and liberty etc. Sandy hook happened.
    While watching Sunday night football that weekend the whole halftime show was Obamas  message to the nation about sandy hook and how we needed stronger gun laws and just like that a switch flipped. Went out the next day and got my first weapon, got a CCP, and started researching and reading about stuff online. It took years before stuff started really clicking for me and being able to see just how deep everything goes while it is still all connected. 
   It&#39;s funny to me though the guy that helped wake me up is not at all into conspiracies and is just strictly about conservative politics. Now I think he thinks I&#39;m the crazy one when 6 years ago it was the oppisite</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It wasn&#39;t exactly an conspiracy that piqued my interest. It was a comment from my grandmother. </p>

<p>I was already interested in things like UFOs and Bigfoot. Unsolved mysteries were interesting to me. Then one day my grandmother said she watched the moon landing on TV and believes it was a hoax. </p>

<p>At the time, I thought it was crazy talk. I had never heard anyone say we didn&#39;t really go to the moon. Hearing a woman who I respect more than anyone on earth say she didn&#39;t believe it made me curious so I started reading.</p>

<p>I grew up hearing about JFK, so i don&#39;t really count that one. And 9/11 was the first time I knew something was not right without anyone else&#39;s input. That undamaged passport they just randomly found very quickly in the rubble was the point I just started yelling at my TV. I was and still am shocked anyone believes that bullshit is the truth. </p>

<p>Watched a documentary about Bohemian Grove. </p>

<p>Seen pictures of past presidents sitting with future presidents and it just clicked. What are the odds in a country of millions and millions of people that two or three of the men selected by the people to run the country would be sitting at the same table?</p>

<p>Not to mention the giant owl thing. (Moloch)</p>

<p>As I say I was very young so I had little understanding of how politics works. Career politicians old boys networks etc. But still my initial instincts were correct. I or you could never be president unless we mix with these types of people and that’s not how it’s supposed to work.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It wasn&#39;t a conspiracy as defined by a big event, but when I was around 13 I was invited to the masonic lodge in my area by an older guy in our church. Basically it was okay until you met the other guys your age or a little bit older &amp; you witness a ceremony &amp; the costuming. </p>

<p>It was too much for me, but I became more aware that there were secret societies &amp; knowledge that was being passed down because more than a few rich guys end up asking me if I knew much about subjects like astral plane travel, illuminati etc. When I admitted that I didn&#39;t know much, they would talk a little bit about their belief in the astral plane. It sounds like bullshit if someone told me what i&#39;m writing now but life is strange sometimes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Iraq invasion in 2003. I heard from so many people that there were MASSIVE protests against the war, and the MSM didn&#39;t show a single frame of footage about it. I knew then that the government would do what it wanted to do and gave zero shits about the will of the people. I&#39;d been primed for this kind of thinking by watching the X-Files in my formative years, but that was the first example to me that this was more than something I&#39;d seen on a TV show. After that, I started looking into 9/11, and my journey down the rabbit hole began. The next major thing was learning about Obama stepping up Bush&#39;s drone program. I had, up until that point, believed that the Repubs were the bad guys and the Dems would save us. That made me realize they were two sides of a very corrupted coin. </p>

<p>But being lied to. And the shot I did because of that lie. And my close friends mom dying less than a year after her son bc she was so depressed she couldn&#39;t take care of herself...no I&#39;m a pretty angry individual at that </p>
