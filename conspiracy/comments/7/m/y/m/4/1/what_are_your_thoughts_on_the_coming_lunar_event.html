A super moon appears up to 30% brighter and 14% larger than normal. On January 21 there will be a blue moon, super moon and lunar eclipse on the same night.

<p>In the early hours of November 14, 2016, a magnitude 7.8 earthquake hit Kaikoura, NZ.</p>

<p>Interesting correlation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Mayan calendar was subdivided into various units the largest of which was called the baktun. I&#39;m not sure on the Gregorian equivalent but we could think of it as an eon. Their calendar transitioned from the 12th baktun to the 13th in 2012 but didn&#39;t continue after that which is where all the end of the world prophecies came from. But the Mayans believed this was actually a transition into a new unknown era, for better or worse. There were stories of shamans who could predict the future but for whatever reason could not see past 2012. I believe we&#39;ve pierced the veil and entered a completely new version of time and space which is why everything feels slightly off, like reality isn&#39;t quite real but you can&#39;t put your finger on it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I get a very weird feeling about January too. Lots of weird weather patterns. There has been a sudden drop in cold lately, and new years eve has a noticeable drop in the forecast. There is also weird planetary stuff..... according to this video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNqU9RIc7kI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNqU9RIc7kI</a>  , the Age of Aquarius will happen in Jan... the planets/stars line up in certain pattern and officially move into the aquarius part of zodiac. The girl does a pretty good job explaining it, and it even matches up with that old 70&#39;s song &quot;age of aquarius&quot;. </p>

<p>Tons of weird stuff have been happening to me too.... I had this feeling to revist my old neighborhood and when I went to the old playground by my childhood home there was a dead hawk on the ground, frozen solid lol. I thought this was a bad omen, but from what I read it could mean a change coming up or some type of awakening or enlightenment, atleast for dead hawks vs owl or crow. I also found a weird stone outside my current house that seems to have some kind of power to it, not exactly magnetic tho.... it makes my body tingle when its nearby, and if I rotate it &quot;upside down&quot; the top of my head tingles. </p>

<p>This all sounds crazy as hell, but I feel like nature is trying to tell me something. And I am not typically superstitious or anything, even conspiracy stuff I don&#39;t follow much until this year when I noticed some of the fringe theories have started to come true. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you ask me, that is this &quot;flu shot&quot; they been pushing for. I know vaccines in general work and make plenty of sense, just like polio back in the day... but flue shot? Not needed at all. What got me truly paranoid about it was that I got multiple texts this year from my insurance company asking me to get the flue shot and then TEXT them to inform em that I got it done. </p>

<p>Why the hell are they texting me out of nowhere after several years, and why are they asking me multiple times to get the shot and let them know? Do they ask me if I got my tetanus redone? Nope... but flu shot, that random virus strain that protects me just for one year... gotta get it done! Just seems weird.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some people worship parasitic worms (no joke) as they see them as the top of the food chain (they live off of us and are hard as funk to get rid of) and model their behavior after how they survive. Vampires and stuff. Alot of old folk tales deal with wyrms that Arabs supposedly like dragonsbbut white in color (lambton worm) or snakes. Worms keep the medical industry afloat andbpay billions of peoples checks every two weeks.</p>

<p>They pattern their behavior on the moon cycles with the full moonn beingbwhen they lay eggs in your body. Its probably a big time for the cult of the worm, ha. </p>
