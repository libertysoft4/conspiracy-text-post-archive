CONCLUSION:</p>

<p>There were 2 shooters according to the one summery, There were two rounds through the neck and back, One in the window and on  Texas Governor John Connally through his chest and wrist,(logically how is this one bullet being over 1 ½ feet seeted away from JFK) (There was 3 shots 1 missed, 4 limbs / body parts shot( Jfk’s neck, throat, and Texas Govnor chest and wrist) ) Also there is Skeptics wondering if the Warren Commission Was Paid Off.</p>

<p>Only Dallas Police and Secret Service Knew the Route.</p>

<p>CIA infiltrated Major Media Sources</p>

<p>Russians Believe Assassination to be a coup but Oswald and Ruby may have ties to Russia? </p>

<p>Hitler Believed to be alive in Colombia </p>

<p>LBJ praised the Assassination of JFK and also claimed to be responsible.</p>

<p>MLK: I am pretty sure the CIA was running a smear campaign I don&#39;t necessarily believe their allegations</p>

<p>Jack Ruby told informant to watch the fireworks and went to see kennedy during the shooting, Same informant watched him during prison</p>

<p>2 shooters Evidence. </p>

<p>“Surgeon General’s Report” on the assassination stated that the first bullet entered the President’s throat below the adams apple, clearly showing that two persons were involved with the first shot being fired from the bridge across the park way in front of the car. To further substantiate this, POTITO said there was a bullet hole in the wind shield of the President’s car”
