        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>(997). A  plant to create a &quot;drug production&quot; case (12/25/2017)</p>

<p>Several months ago, my wife brought home three cases of cooking material. Asking her why bought so many, she said some were for my sisters. The label on bottle said &quot;Marinated cooking wine with salt&quot;. It was a rare used cooking material. I then recalled the &quot;vinegar&quot; event. 15 years ago, she bought a lot of white vinegar which rarely used in cooking. Then I learned vinegar was also a material used to produce drug. I thought it was a trick to frame me in a &quot;drug producing&quot; case and wrote #112. How they plant.&quot;</p>

<p>Now when the Feds(FBI and DEA) are eager to finish the case, they try all kinds of their tricks to frame a case, include that &quot;drug production&quot; method. I think that alcohol may be a material for &quot;drug producing&quot;. </p>

<p>My wife put the case at the passage of the kitchen. Probably with purpose that I move the box frequently so they can use it as evidence. Not a coincidence that she also put a big bottle (gallon size) of vinegar at the side of box. See the picture. </p>

<p><a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-cQSZ-woHVgM/WchNbo0lsMI/AAAAAAAAAZI/h4zJgPN7CXUCxYb4PNjjgdXnmlEONIVlwCEwYBhgL/w140-h105-p/009.JPG">https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-cQSZ-woHVgM/WchNbo0lsMI/AAAAAAAAAZI/h4zJgPN7CXUCxYb4PNjjgdXnmlEONIVlwCEwYBhgL/w140-h105-p/009.JPG</a></p>

<p>(112.) How they plant (2) (2003)</p>

<p>About that time in 2001, a lady suddenly called my wife to shopping in super market. Among the &quot;harvest&quot;, I found my wife bought 8 bottles of vinegar. Vinegar is a popular sauce for cooking. But what she bought was a western style we rarely used. We used to use vinegar made in China. My wife argued that because it was on sale, &quot;buy one get one free&quot; and because the other lady bought a lot too. So she followed her. She forgot the lesson how she was guided to cash the check. Now the same act played again. I was sensitive because I felt the pressure then they were framing case against me. I knew from paper that vinegar is a material to produce drug. And that lady had ever shopping with my wife. That was the only one as I know. Now after one year most of these vinegar are still there unused. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>15 years ago, OP&#39;S wife bought a bunch of vinegar, now she&#39;s bought a bunch of wine. OP thinks she&#39;s planning to frame him for producing drugs. 15 years is an awfully long time to work on this scheme in my opinion. Also, what drug would this be?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, my point is that vinegar or wine might be used in wine producing, I&#39;ve never heard of it but I&#39;ll admit I don&#39;t know that much about it. They&#39;re also commonly used in cooking and household chores, so it would super easy to explain them away in the unlikely even that police come by asking questions.</p>

<p>On the other hand, there are things that have <em>some</em> innocent uses but are more commonly associated with drug production. Scales, large amounts of &#39;behind the counter&#39; antihistamines, steel wool, bulk quantities of kitchen matches. </p>

<p>I just don&#39;t think you&#39;re thinking clearly on this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The heck kind of drug can you make with vinegar? I use white vinegar to mop, generally clean, in place of Jetdry in my dishwasher and in place of fabric softener in the rinse cycle. It has a billion other household uses. If your wife were framing you for drugs she&#39;d be stocking up on something suspicious like psudophedrine and matches, not something as innocuous as vinegar.</p>
