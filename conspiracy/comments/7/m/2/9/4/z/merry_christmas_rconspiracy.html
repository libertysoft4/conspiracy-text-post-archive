        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>In the midst of spending time with our friends and family, I hope we can take a moment to celebrate the birth and most importantly the teachings of this great man, Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>His mission was to spread the Gospel, otherwise known as the good news. And his message was simple yet incredibly empowering.</p>

<p>He said, &quot;the Truth will set us free.&quot; That, &quot;the kingdom of God is within.&quot;</p>

<p>We suffer because deep down on an unconscious level, we are aware of our divine nature. However, society indoctrinates us into believing that we are inadequate and therefore must prove our worth, often through an engineered version of success. It is a losing endeavor where we are set up to fail as the game has always been rigged. And even for those who &quot;make it,&quot; there will always be an emptiness, a void that they cannot fill. Simply because there was never any void that needed to be filled in the first place.</p>

<p>This message was delivered over two thousand years ago but it is still relevant as ever. We are all sons and daughters of God! There is a divine spark within each and every one of us and there is nothing we need to do to earn or deserve it! All we need to do is to realize it. To come to know it. </p>

<p>On this day, I hope we can all feel like kings and queens and treat others as graciously as kings and queens would. </p>

<p>May the Truth set all of humanity free. And may the spirit of Jesus Christ live forever!</p>

<p>Merry Christmas 🎄,</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that&#39;s all nonsense. The teachings of the Christ were obviously corrupted to serve a political agenda. I believe that his teachings were more in line with the mystics who taught about oneness and that the way to experience or realize this is through the denial of our ego. Jesus specifically taught about loving others as we love ourselves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And I&#39;m saying that the only register of a guy called jesus is in the bible (the Romans <em>never</em> recorded anything about a guy named jesus), and it is in the same book that contains talking snakes, talking donkeys, people living inside of whales and a supposed hateful god creating the universe in 7 days. But jesus was real, of course. </p>

<p>What I mean is: as every believer, you take the parts you like and fits the narrative you want to believe and dismiss the rest, when <em>all of it</em> should be dismissed, <em>all of it</em> is compromised. Talking donkeys and jesus have <em>the same relevance</em>. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think there is a distinction to be made between scientific truths and philosophical truths. For example, a myth or a fair tale can have a lesson in it that teaches us about ethics and morality. Considering that happiness and fulfillment is the goal for every human being, if a story, made up or embellished, teaches us how to achieve those goals, then that can be considered a truth in some aspects. It doesn&#39;t really matter what we call it but one can&#39;t deny that it is in fact meaningful and of value.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel like you are just cherry picking things to continue to argue.</p>

<p>As I&#39;ve said many times, the bible was never meant to be read as a literal account. In other words, if there is a talking donkey, you are completely missing the point fixating on the fact that donkey&#39;s can&#39;t talk. The point isn&#39;t to scrutinize whether something actually happened or not, or whether or not something is possible, it&#39;s to try to understand the meaning or lessons behind the story. </p>

<p>For example, if there is a story about a talking donkey that tells a hero to only load one bag of gold on his back but the hero out of greed ends up loading two, and later on in the story, the donkey dies out of exhaustion and the hero ends up not being able to take any bags of gold back to his village, then the lesson is that the hero ought not to be greedy.</p>

<p>Imagine you tell that story to someone and he keeps on fixating on the fact that donkey&#39;s can&#39;t talk. What would you tell him? </p>

<p>You are conflating the teachings of Jesus with the rest of the bible. The bible is a collection of stories which happen to contain the stories of Jesus and his teachings among others. Just because there are other books in the that may contradict his teachings doesn&#39;t take anything away from the value of Jesus&#39; teachings.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like if I took a peer reviewed academic study and threw it in with a bunch flat earth texts and called it one book. Just because they happen to be grouped together as one text doesn&#39;t mean that the former is now invalid. You can look at the bible in the same way. The teachings of Jesus were chosen out of thousands of texts by the Catholic church to fit a certain narrative, one that I believe was political in nature.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Again, bringing up the fact that donkey&#39;s can&#39;t talk doesn&#39;t negate the value of the teachings because as I&#39;ve stated numerous times, the story was not meant to be taken literally but symbolically.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think Jesus teachings were meant to either. They were used in a nefarious way by the Catholic church so it would be unfair to blame that on Jesus. Many of his teachings and his quotes were misconstrued to control the masses with fear. Heaven and hell for example was a concept that I believe was invented by the church, misinterpreting Jesus&#39; sayings. I think all of the strong language that he used in favor of it was meant symbolically - about a hell that one can experience on earth if his heart is full of hate, jealous, envy etc. </p>

<p>I agree that the bible interpreted the way Church intended to, as an agent of control and fear mongering, is a problem and can impede scientific discoveries as well as give a reason to be bigoted.</p>

<p>The only part of it that I&#39;ve found interesting or somewhat relevant. Makes me think of 0&#39;s and 1&#39;s, computers and matrix but I&#39;m <em>really</em> stretching here, and the context really have nothing to do with it. </p>

<p>The rest of it humanity would definitely be in a better place if his myth hadn&#39;t survived, or if they were propagated as &quot;&quot;he&quot;&quot; said  originally since they don&#39;t add nothing to reality but it&#39;s just an attempt to either explain it or make you feel better about it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am Christian and I do agree the origins are pagan.</p>

<p>With that being said, I do not think Christ would comdemn anybody celebrating the holiday with love and good intentions.</p>

<p>Our society makes Christmas about money and gifts. It is in complete contradiction to the words of the bible.</p>

<p>Am I saying one cannot buy gifts for loved ones? No. I am just saying there are those who celebrate Christmas with love and good intentions and those who do not.</p>

<p>Also it is important to never be so dogmatic that we forget love. Christ even broke rules! So it makes me laugh that some &quot;Christian&quot; groups like JWs are so worried about celebrating a holiday like Christmas. The point is, with the right intentions, Christmas can be a good thing.</p>

<p>Sadly, most do not really care about the spirit behind it all. I am disgusted often with the materialism of this time of the year.</p>

<p>Christmas is often very painful for me for personal reasons, too.</p>

<p>Still I will not take away from those who get true joy and love out of this holiday season.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t help but feel pointing this out is a bit pedantic. You are right that Jesus wasn&#39;t born on that day and as some users pointed out, Jesus may not have even been a real person. But since it&#39;s a day that is universally acknowledged as his birth, what&#39;s the harm in celebrating him and his teachings on this day? I don&#39;t the aforementioned criticism is really all that relevant.</p>

The thing is if you are referring to the right person then it doesn&#39;t matter what you call him/her yet if you utter the name not referring to the person then it yields no power behind it.

<p>Before I struggled with emptiness, but now I feel truly full.</p>

<p>All the money, success, fame, materials, sex, drugs, distraction, porn, (insert vice here) can never truly fullfill anybody.</p>

<p>In the end, &quot;you can&#39;t take it with you.&quot; Yet people spend their entire lives focused on the materialistic lies and illusions of this world.</p>

<p>In reality, all we will take with us is our soul.</p>

<p>There is a spiritual battle that many do not recognize:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians+6:12&amp;amp;version=NIV&amp;amp;interface=amp">https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians+6:12&amp;amp;version=NIV&amp;amp;interface=amp</a></p>

<p>Anyway the point I am trying to make is the only thing that has ever truly fullfilled me is Christ.</p>

<p>It does not mean all my problems are gone. It just means that I have a spiritual protection that I did not have before.</p>

<p>For those who do not know, I was raised to hate Christ. I am so thankful I decided to search for the truth a few years ago.</p>

<p>I am willing to answer any questions. Merry Christmas!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And what teachings are celebrated? Spend lots of money for these corporations to make big bucks? Ya hang out with your family, but make sure you spend all this money first</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Those are not his teachings...</p>

<p>Considering that happiness and fulfillment is the goal for every human being, if a story, made up or embellished, teaches us how to achieve those goals, then that can be considered a truth in some aspects.</p>

<p>Living in lies and believing in lies would not fit into happiness and fullfillment but ignorance. &quot;Ignorance is a bliss&quot;. If everyone sought ignorance then we wouldn&#39;t have evolved and become smarter.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel like you are just cherry picking things to continue to argue.</p>

<p>As I&#39;ve said many times, the bible was never meant to be read as a literal account. In other words, if there is a talking donkey, you are completely missing the point fixating on the fact that donkey&#39;s can&#39;t talk. The point isn&#39;t to scrutinize whether something actually happened or not, or whether or not something is possible, it&#39;s to try to understand the meaning or lessons behind the story. </p>

<p>For example, if there is a story about a talking donkey that tells a hero to only load one bag of gold on his back but the hero out of greed ends up loading two, and later on in the story, the donkey dies out of exhaustion and the hero ends up not being able to take any bags of gold back to his village, then the lesson is that the hero ought not to be greedy.</p>

<p>Imagine you tell that story to someone and he keeps on fixating on the fact that donkey&#39;s can&#39;t talk. What would you tell him? </p>
