        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>How could something like the &quot;internet&quot; happen?</p>

<p>I had my red pill moment a very long time ago, I was 15 years old and the event that opened my eyes was</p>

<p>&quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nayirah_testimony">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nayirah_testimony</a>&quot;</p>

<p>From that moment on, I could no longer close my eyes to lies, injustice and manipulation.</p>

<p>And I wanted to know as much as possible, I had to be sure that I would never be lied to again, I had to understand why this girl, who was the same age as me, lied.</p>

<p>Internet was not that widespread yet, 
but I knew from the beginning that it would be a helpful tool to understand the world.</p>

<p>The more I understood about the world, the less I understood how it could happen.</p>

<p>The Internet!</p>

<p>How could that happen?</p>

<p>The powerful, who had gained experience for centuries, possibly even millennia of years,
had drawn a net across the world that is only recognized by a few.
They knew very well that they had to control all the important positions in the world, you can see that if you only look back for 100-200 years, I have no doubt.</p>

<p>So how could the powerful not have understood the transformative power, how could they not realize that the Internet would be the end of their power?</p>

<p>I just do not understand how it could happen.</p>

<p>They had all the threads in their hands, and did not see it come that information and knowledge would change everything forever.</p>

<p>So, what do you think about it, why did the powerful allow us to have internet.
Is this a part of their plan? 
And if so, how can the internet be used against us?
I think that&#39;s important</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I know, she was needed to convince people.
And that was the moment that opened my eyes.
I understood what they would do to achieve their goal.
And that is ONLY possible with people who do not have all the information.
So how could they overlook the fact that the Internet would be such a powerful weapon against their lies?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cause its not... Bar the occasional leak (which is ignored by many) the internet makes it harder to obtain information. anyone can be anyone and anyone can be a &quot;journalist&quot;. No one needs to check sources online and anyone can makeup a source online. Perfect example is the vaccine debate, for every article or medical study that says they help there are 2 more that say they done. Some a reputable and others aren&#39;t. With the internet they added bias into the information you gather. You can now choose to disregard and find something that supports your bias. Where though, before you had a singular source of information and if you wanted more you had to talk to people or send in information request to the library of congress or to the FBI.    </p>

And I agree with you, but I&#39;m not as pessimistic as you are.
I think the truth is out there, but sometimes you have to dig longer and deeper, but at the end of the day it will come to light.
But I have to say this is how I want to see the world, 
if I did not believe that we have a chance to find a truth, what would be the meaning of all that we call life.
At least I have to know that the people around me do not have completely different truths than I have.
That would make life incredibly difficult.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, so you are aware.  </p>

<p>One of the nine Satanic sins is solipsism.  It is a sin for a Satanist to practice solipsism, but Satanists want others to practice it.  That way, other people are easier to manipulate and control.  Same with stupidity.  </p>

<p>Interesting point of view.
That might actually explain in part why they gave us the Internet.
But then I have to assume that they have underestimated the beast, and the sleeping giant is now partially awakened.
I would say the giant has opened at least one eye, and I do not think he goes back to sleep for the time being.
But who knows that, maybe the TPTB know a lullaby.</p>

<p>I think you underestimate how much people were ready for computers.
From the moment Pong was available to private customers, only the sky was the limit.
We still had a dial-up phone, but we&#39;ve dreamed of Skype back then.
and we did not have to wait long for a Star Trek communicator.</p>

<p>Ok, he was stupid!
I work in a computer exhibition, which is a small part of my job.
But we have storage that weighs 250 kg and is as big as truck brake discs, and they only have 2.5mb storage space.
I think he should have known that 64kb is not enough.
But I could be wrong.</p>

That information could be used for innumerable purposes. Many of them devious. </p>

<p>And if so, how can the internet be used against us?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>By creating the illusion of freedom for example.</p>

<p>Increasing the tools to spy on people (all modern cellphones have a built-in GPS and Google tracks your every movement and records all your voice serches).</p>

<p>By keeping people numb browsing facebook, watching porn or even chasing their own tail in useless stuff..</p>

<p>There are lots of possibilities. If TPTB are half what people say they are, if there were real power on the web, they would not share it with us..</p>

<p>This overestimates the influence and foresight of TPTB - which isn&#39;t to say their powers aren&#39;t vast but that the possible progressions of human affairs is vaster.</p>

<p>If you look at any competitive system there are always either internal or external disruptions. Horses are disrupted by automobiles, armored knights are disrupted by gunpowder, dinosaurs are disrupted by meteorites.</p>

<p>The rapid development and adoption of the internet as we know it, arguably, took everyone by surprise, and all sides could be seen as playing a game of catch-up to figure out how to exploit the new tool as well as how to counter competing exploitations.</p>

<p>And if you look at what&#39;s going on now, you&#39;ll see methods and measures being employed to control and mitigate the spread of information through the internet, e.g. trolls, shills, spoof, and dis-info.</p>

<p>It&#39;s basically a war, and the fighting never stops.</p>
