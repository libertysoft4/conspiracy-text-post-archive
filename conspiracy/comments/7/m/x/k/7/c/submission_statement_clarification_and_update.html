        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7m8q75/submission_statements_now_required_for_all_link/"><em>previous thread</em></a></p>

<p>Rule 13 on submission statements has been live for a couple days now, and we wanted to give an update and try to clear up some misunderstandings. As we have said, this is a trial rule, and as such, we feel the need to make our new requirements a bit more explicit, so that you can know what criteria we&#39;re using to evaluate the statements, and understand our reasoning behind these requirements. This is the standard we will be using:</p>

<ol>
<li>2+ sentences</li>
<li>If OP makes multiple top-level comments, one should be clearly labeled as the submission statement.</li>
<li>written in OP&#39;s own words (i.e. not copied from the article or description)</li>
<li>should explain or elaborate on why the link is being posted to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and why the userbase should care about it.</li>
</ol>

<p>The minimum limit is to combat the problem of people writing only a few words. We get that OPs sometimes want to add significant additional content and context, and we very much encourage that, but if you do make several top-level, please clearly mark one comment as the submission statement. </p>

<p>The submission statement should be in your own words (not copied) and should explain why you feel the link is of interest to the users of this sub. I should be clear here: We <strong>are not</strong> evaluating whether we think your answer is valid, but only that it actually answers the question of <em>why</em> the post should be here.</p>

<p>Here are a few examples of decent submission statements:</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7mpi9a/-/drvoiki/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7mpi9a/-/drvoiki/</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7mro94/-/drw6145/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7mro94/-/drw6145/</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7mw2x2/-/drx2sdq/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7mw2x2/-/drx2sdq/</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7mus6j/-/drwrwd3/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7mus6j/-/drwrwd3/</a></li>
</ol>

<p>And to reiterate, <strong><em>Rule 13 only applies to link posts (including image posts),</em></strong> not self posts, so you don&#39;t need to be reporting those.</p>

<hr/>

<p>The second part of this update is to let you know that we are now running a bot, u/rConBot, to help us deal with the increased workload this new rule has created. The only thing the bot does is removes posts whose OPs have not made a top-level comment within 20 minutes of posting. This only handles part of the workload, but so far it has removed about 140 posts in two days of running, and I think we&#39;ve reinstated about 5 posts whose OP had subsequently added a submission statement.</p>

<p>What this also means is that there is no reason to report a post less than 20 min old for not having a submission statement; the bot will take care of it. If a post older than about 25 minutes still has no submission statement, or doesn&#39;t meet the above requirements, feel free to report it. </p>

<hr/>

<p>Apart from that, we&#39;d like feedback as to how you think the rule is affecting the sub. Keep in mind, it&#39;s still the holiday break for many people, so posting and commenting patterns are going to be somewhat atypical anyway. It will be a few weeks into 2018 before we can really gauge the effect this change is having, and we plan on having another sticky post at that time to discuss it.</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Update to clarify that image posts <em>do</em> require submission statements as well.</p>

<p>Sometimes the headline is clear enough without needing 2+ sentences of explanation.  I feel this is requirement is put in for The Others that visit here and don&#39;t grok this stuff.  So with this requirement we&#39;re now dumbing down to appease visitors instead of using critical thinking.</p>

<ol>
<li>There is no need to explain the reason(s) for the submission, it&#39;s in the title, and it&#39;s a well established topic in &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; realm (ie. ancient lost technology and civilizations - Atlantis, Agartha, etc etc).</li>

<p>For your post, I&#39;d probably agree. Anyone who&#39;s been in conspiracy circles for more than a year or two should probably know at least a bit about <em>truly ancient</em> Egypt. We had even considered the idea of restricting rule 13 to only current politics posts, but ultimately I think that would have been unworkable: just too much subjectivity on what constitutes &quot;current politics.&quot;</p>

<p>The end result is that users posting &quot;classic&quot; conspiracy content are going to need to take an extra minute or two writing a statement, with the benefit that a lot of the spam seems to be reduced. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t necessarily disagree with this line of reasoning, but I don&#39;t see how this change really makes a huge difference. OPs have always been able to make comments explaining their view on the linked content, and readers have always had the option of reading comments first (OP&#39;s or other users&#39;) or following the link first. Like I said in another comment, I don&#39;t see this rule changing browsing/commenting habits <em>that</em> much. </p>

<hr/>

<p>As someone who reads pretty much all the content here, what&#39;s your opinion of the <em>effect</em> of rule 13 so far? I won&#39;t hold you to it if you change you mind later on, but as far as /new and /hot, do you like the change you see or not?</p>

<p>I disagree, and personally... I think that may be the problem with y&#39;all. It&#39;s not as hard you may think to discern political news and/or what not from legit conspiracy theories which do not really need a SS (especially if it&#39;s hinted at in the title).</p>

<p>I&#39;ve told you and others in other places, we are not a brand, so don&#39;t try to make us into one. It&#39;s a fool&#39;s errand, will never happen, and will do more harm than good. Remember, there are always unintended consequences.</p>

<p>I still have mixed feelings, obviously, but I think it&#39;s somewhat of an improvement and a valuable trial. I&#39;m glad to see far less political news/spam here, that&#39;s for sure. </p>

<p>Ultimately though, like I&#39;ve told you, I believe that mods need to interact/participate with the community more, and some need to... Well, you know ;).</p>

<p>Anyways, like I&#39;ve said before... I commend you all for trying to address the shit show, and it will be interesting as we go forward.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not that it&#39;s hard — I think I could do it adequately enough, and I imagine you&#39;d probably agree with 95% of my decisions — it&#39;s that it introduces an amount of subjectivity on something that I think is better solved this way. You don&#39;t even trust half the mods, and a good amount of users don&#39;t trust the other half (or all of us). Would you want one of the mods you don&#39;t trust to be determining what is or isn&#39;t &quot;political?&quot; It would have made rolling out this rule an absolute shitshow.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t say worried, but I would say &quot;considering the unintended consequences.&quot; You don&#39;t think we&#39;d have thread after thread, and comments on any &quot;problematic&quot; post (read: actual conspiracy content) that didn&#39;t have an SS, just trying to slide the conversation? The shit slingers abuse every rule we have now, especially when they&#39;re ambiguous. I might have even preferred restricting it to only political posts, but I think that distinction would have caused more trouble than it would be worth. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No offense meant, but saying anyone who&#39;s been in conspiracy circles for more than a year or two should know about X, that&#39;s making kind of high falutin&#39; assumptions. Some of us have a definite bent towards following only certain types of conspiracies, but that doesn&#39;t make us completely walled off from some other vein that might be interesting to us, and maybe even draw us in to investigate further. Isn&#39;t that part of why we post here? To bring in new theorists and entice people to participate and learn more?</p>

<p>For example, I have what I would consider limited knowledge on ancient Egyptian archeology when it comes to related conspiracies, but I&#39;m not opposed to exploring further if a link seems interesting enough. I don&#39;t have time to read EVERY SINGLE POST here, lol, so that statement really helps me out a lot.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I dunno, I feel like I appreciate a little summary information before I read an article, and ESPECIALLY before I click a youtube link, gah! </p>

<p>Even those YT videos usually have some kind of description of what you might expect. For example, your reference video has this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Osireion of Abydos in Egypt is attributed to Pharoah Seti I but the site is a true enigma that closely resembles the Valley temple on the Giza Plateau. With 4 metre high granite pillars from the Aswan quarry 200 miles away and stone cutting techniques that must have been produced using ancient high technology, watch this video to learn more about the mystery of the Osireion.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If I am not that into archeology (not saying I&#39;m not!) this might not draw my interest just from the title, but after reading that description, WOW!  I am actually going to watch it now. Really : )</p>

<p>I say let&#39;s keep the submission statement for now. A little extra work to help flesh out what the link is about does have value for some of us. And, although I&#39;m still not of a solid opinion yet, the new link posts sure do appear a lot less trashy.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t understand this. How does requiring OPs to write why a post belongs here dumb things down? You&#39;re free and in fact encouraged to apply your own critical thinking to a post regardless of what an OP may write about it.</p>

<p>This is certainly a possibility, but I&#39;m not sure if the submission statement in itself is going to affect behavior that much. I think most users either usually read headlines then vote/comment, read articles then vote/comment, or read comments (and maybe then read the article) then comment. I&#39;m usually the last one. I&#39;ll read the first couple of comments to make a decision as to whether to bother reading the article, then read it, then comment. This will certainly be something to watch moving forward, though. </p>

<p>This may also be, although I&#39;m not really seeing it yet. We used to always get the &quot;where&#39;s the conspiracy?&quot; comment, which would often end up as the top-voted (and thus first-seen) comment. I&#39;ve seen less of this so far, but it&#39;s still pretty early. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have been skipping to the statement if the title isn&#39;t enough for me for whatever reason. I WANT to see why the OP thinks it&#39;s worth my time to read it, and get a little more detail before I spend my valuable time reading or watching what has been offered. I really don&#39;t see anything wrong with that.</p>

<p>I peruse a variety of subs, and there are always mockers, arguers and dissers. Can&#39;t we just ignore them? If someone starts challenging me aggressively and with a nasty attitude, I usually go check their post history first, and if it is their m.o. to waste peoples time, then I just ignore them (haha, okay, not always, sometimes they really get my goat).</p>

<p>The point is, you can&#39;t let these people dictate what we do here, at least I don&#39;t think we should. I think our goal should be to clean things up, make it more comprehensive, make it easier to find articles of interest, and become more &#39;professional&#39; in appearance. Hopefully then people will take r/conspiracy more seriously.</p>

<p>Maybe I&#39;m a simpleton, but a &quot;thesis&quot; statement of sorts doesn&#39;t seem like a bad idea to me. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A conspiracy is by nature not taken seriously by those who do not wish to believe in the possibilities purported by such a theory, we can&#39;t get around that. However, I do believe that we can do a better job presenting information in a more professional and mature manner. </p>

<p>When I say &quot;seriously,&quot; I suppose I mean that r/conspiracy won&#39;t be taken seriously as long as some of our more &#39;fervent&#39; posters here can&#39;t present their case without getting emotionally worked up, taking the bait when taunted. To be taken seriously you have be BE serious - stay in control, be mature and counter arguments plainly and unemotionally as often as you can. I watch some (most) of these threads break up in to the same old childish back and forth stupidity, spurred on by members of r/controversy. Consequently, I have a hard time taking them seriously as well. Poor behavior degrades the sincerity that this sub should exude.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Personally, I feel like I have read more articles (yes, I have skipped some, too) that I wouldn&#39;t have because of the statement. It&#39;s helpful to me to be able to filter through and not waste my time with something I&#39;m really not going to be interested in. However,  I&#39;m getting the feeling that some here think this makes someone like me a lesser human being for appreciating a summary before I dig in. : (</p>

<p>Honestly, it is not so abnormal to preface any kind of theory or article with an introductory statement. Youtube videos more often than not have them, scientific papers have them, etc. etc. </p>

<p>I feel like it might bring more authenticity to r/conspiracy to also include such a statement.</p>

<p>I&#39;m still weighing out how it feels overall though, so take this for what it&#39;s worth.</p>

<p>It wouldn&#39;t really work, especially not on a sub of this size with so many competing interests seeking to control what hits the front page. The only way to hide the downvote button is using CSS, which only affects desktop (probably less than half of users) and is very easily circumvented. </p>

<p>It took me a minute to realize that the OP had rapid-fire posted around 23 more link posts within. (although it looks like some have been removed now). I had never seen anything like it and I was really confused that as to why someone would do that. </p>

<p>If you&#39;re looking at posts under 20 minutes old, we won&#39;t remove those for lacking a submission statement. Are there any posts older than that with no top-level OP comments at all, or are you talking about submission statements that don&#39;t meet the 4 requirements laid out above?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. I mean how hard is it to post a few sentences of context on your link? It&#39;s encourages debate in the comments and gives people context for the link, as well as give discernment on whether people should click the link or not in the first place (Is it any good? Am I truly interested in this? Do I want to click and learn more or do I pass on this one?).</p>

<p>Ideally people should argument their links even more, but that is probably already a step too far.</p>

<p>People are afraid that mods will remove links with these statements if they don&#39;t agree with them. That&#39;s simply nonsense and I do not see it happening at all.</p>

<p>If anyone truly finds the mods are removing submission statements because they don&#39;t like the content (and not because the statement is a copy of the article, one sentence long or just absolutely absurd drivel) then screenshot it and make a thread about it, with obvious evidence of a good submission statement (a few sentences long, not copied...abiding by the above rules which <em>say nothing about the content of the statement apart from it not being copied</em>) being trashed. Then we can argue how the mods are shills. Based on my personal observation of this sub I do feel most mods here (or all of them, I cannot speak for everyone though) are genuine and want to make this sub a better place. </p>

<p>I&#39;d also encourage anyone that argues against these statements (and this thread will soon be filled with them) to state you suggestions on how to improve the sub. This will show who the shills are and who is a genuine user that wants to improve debate. </p>

<p>Disagreeing is absolutely fine, however simply disagreeing without suggestions amounts to fruitless discussions with no productive value.</p>

<p>My personal suggestion (as stated in another comment below) would be having a few days a week (or at least one day), text post only. Text posts encourage a lot more debate and links can always be included in them (more than one even), with even more context and concise arguments to boot.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="/u/Jac0b777">/u/Jac0b777</a> and I have been discussing this for months, maybe a year now. I like the idea for self-post only days, but we&#39;ll probably wait to see how this rule 13 plays out before throwing something else into the mix. Already, I think this rule has had the effect of giving self posts more of a chance of hitting the front page and getting good discussion, which I find to be a good thing. We&#39;ll see how it plays out, but we might not even need dedicated self post days.</p>

<p>As far as themed daily text-posts, we do have the biweekly(?) round table discussions and featured documentaries, which I think are pretty positive and have a similar effect to what you&#39;re talking about. I wouldn&#39;t be opposed to expanding this to include some other regularly-scheduled sub-wide discussions.</p>

<p>Maybe if the Board normalizes a bit we can tall about Weekend Mode and Weekday Mode (maybe?) but as it currently stands I don&#39;t see self posts getting flooded out at the moment.</p>

<p>For awhile the Sub seemed to to be more like a ticker - flimsy, quick, not thoughtful, never ending. Now it seems more like a Board - durable,  more steady, and something you can build upon.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m generally wary of &quot;megaposts&quot; as implemented in the major news subs, which generally means one post is stickied on a topic, and all other links about the topic are removed. If anything, I find it&#39;s a lot easier to bury certain details and minority opinions, because you have to scroll pretty far to get past the first few top-level comments, and many of the comments get completely hidden past 1500 (unless you know how to search for them, but most people don&#39;t bother).</p>

<p>The effect on our sub is that when a major event happens, like Vegas, we get a ton of posts on the event that do somewhat push out other topics. I don&#39;t think this is ideal, but IMO is much better than removing posts that shed light on details that might otherwise be missed. I wouldn&#39;t in general be opposed to making a general sticky thread for such events, with links to the other posts, but I would not support removing other posts about the topic (provided they follow rules.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Imho text posts are so much more superior to links. People actually have to put in some content, argue their point, give their own insights....etc.  (or so they should)</p>

<p>I guess links have their place in a way and the backlash would be huge if they were removed.</p>

<p>I was thinking about something like a text-post only day of the week, or perhaps two days. One or two days of the week when only text posts would be posted.</p>

<p>I think that would be awesome and seriously encourage lively and insightful, argumentative debate more than links.</p>

<p>An interesting reason for this may also be that whenever links are posted you literally have to click the mini &#39;comments&#39; button below to get to the comments, while clicking a text post takes you directly to the comments. Obviously clicking the &#39;comments&#39; link is easy, but I still think that comments are more visited in text posts rather than links, because people tend to click on the link and go to the page directly. And if comments were more visited, then guess what &gt; more argumentative, insightful debate, less spam...etc.</p>

<p>I stopped making self posts myself, because it would just get lost in the fray.</p>

<p>In a few days time, the front page has been consistently been full of much better content, with a demonstrable increase in self posts, which IMO is generally where you find the best stuff on this sub.</p>

<p>But this is r/conspiracy... Why don&#39;t you just require that every title be an explicit conspiracy statement. That accomplishes two goals of focusing the sub, as well as organizing the content into topics instead of fragments of information with bad submission statements.</p>

<p>I would love this sub to be more conspiracy centered instead of random fishy news centered.. the random fishy news should be a comment as evidence for discussion under an appropriate conspiracy post...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I disagree. The mods are volunteers, the majority of the sub agreed to submission statements as a requirement and it is most efficient to have that policed in an unbiased manner. The last thing we need around here are endless shitshow arguments about mods removing posts based on the subjectivity of whether the title is substantive enough to qualify. And then we would have the problem of user-created titles being reported for being misleading. A SS comment solves a lot of problems and reduces workload.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure that we&#39;ve really come to a decision on this. The bot should be taking care of all posts with no submission statement at all,  so users shouldn&#39;t even have to worry about that. As for an OP who posts a submission statement that another user doesn&#39;t feel meets the requirements, reporting it or sending a modmail is the best way to go, or send a PM to the OP so they can correct it. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think we ever ban for rule 2, and certainly not for a first or second offense. But yeah, I don&#39;t want to see that either. </p>

<p>To an extent, yes, but there&#39;s certainly an amount of fatigue that comes from scrolling through dozens of posts that all have to do with blatantly political spam. I think a very small fraction of our userbase is actually reading through every single headline in a given day; they either look at the first couple dozen of /hot or of /new. To me, it looks like there&#39;s a larger variety on both the /hot and /new than before the rule, and less overtly political spam from both sides. </p>

<p>This rule isn&#39;t really designed to combat shills, but spammers, and I think it has done so.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a couple I&#39;ve banned recently (I&#39;m purposely not user-mentioning them):</p>

<ul>
<li>kamrulhira</li>
<li>pitchforkmafia87</li>
</ul>

<p>They post almost exclusively from the same site/channel or two, and rarely if ever comment on any posts. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I disagree. If a user looks at the first 25 posts on /hot, and only a couple actually interest them, they&#39;re much less likely to go to the next page. But if they see 10 or 15 genuinely interesting posts, they&#39;re more likely to engage and scroll to see other posts. A low signal to noise ratio makes finding good content harder, even if the same amount of signal exists in both cases.</p>

<p>What evidence do you have that it has reduced spammers?
What evidence do you have that there are spammers.
Spammers, bots and shills have never bothered me.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t you think spammers are smart enough to add a couple of sentences to their post?</p>

<p>A true spammer will add the two sentences without a second thought, but non spammers might be dissuaded from posting at all.  </p>

<p>kamrulhira doesn&#39;t look like a spammer, and they have posted two (2) posts to r/conspiracy in their total history of two months. Is that really a problem. Please.</p>

<p>pitchforkmafia87 has 32 posts to r/conspiracy in the last two months, that&#39;s one post every two days. Is that really a huge problem. Please.</p>

<p>In my opinion, you are basing your censorship on a non existent threat.</p>

<p>About people skipping over posts they are not interested in, your opinion of how people look at posts is just that, your opinion.</p>

<p>I for instance look at all the posts on new until I reach the posts I have already read.</p>

<p>My opinion on how people read posts is that they read what they are interested in until they get tired of reading posts. I feel my opinion is much more likely than your opinion.</p>

<p>But, hey, how can just a LITTLE bit of censorship be a problem, right. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t fear bots, shills and spam, they have never bothered me, never once.</p>

<p>What I really do fear and really bothers me is people in control making rules that they want that interferes with the free flow of information.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/rconbot/comments/">https://www.reddit.com/user/rconbot/comments/</a></p>

<p>Every one of those posts has merit.</p>

<p>This time actually look at the titles of the posts and tell me you don&#39;t see a problem.</p>

<p>Use that list of titles and show me a few examples of things you think should have been censored? I looked at about 80% and could not find one that should have been deleted. I think if you are honest about this you will agree with me.</p>

<p>I call it the junk yard dog problem. Give someone a little bit of control and they invariably feel the need to control, even to the detriment of others. </p>

<hr/>

<p>Comment Statement: I&#39;m not trolling. You asked for a good argument. This is one; it may affect only few; but these minorities do exist, and I met them online. Completely unreadable comments, everyone made fun of them until they came out as dyslexic, and suddenly, we all had huge respect for their trying. </p>

<p>But it&#39;s really the only one I can think of. Other than that, the rule has proven to be extremely effective in decluttering the sub. If it sounds stupid, but works, it isn&#39;t stupid. In fact, I think it&#39;s a great idea. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I  think  you guys should consider a whitelist of posters if that is at all practical and can bee added to the bot&#39;s functionality without a lot of effort. Longtime regular posters to the sub, who have no track record of abusing the freedom from censorship and moderation that this sub offers, should be considered for exemption.</p>

<p>Perhaps there could be consideration of having the whitelist as an incentive that people can gain over time if they show a good track record of participation and positive contribution to the sub.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I think <a href="/u/orangutan">/u/orangutan</a> can also be a little more supportive as the submission statements are currently just being <em>tried</em> on a trial basis as a way to make this more of a <em>conspiracy</em> sub again rather than a place for people to spam low-effort links that they probably have not even read. (not accusing you of this) </p>

<p>I also think you are being <em>slightly</em> disingenuous in your oh-so full-throated support of of the veracity and validity of reddit&#39;s current voting system.</p>

<p>But I&#39;d also say self posts with a single link and nothing else are much less likely to rise than the same link, same title as a link post.

<p>The second part of this update is to let you know that we are now running a bot, u/rConBot, to help us deal with the increased workload this new rule has created. The only thing the bot does is removes posts whose OPs have not made a top-level comment within 20 minutes of posting. This only handles part of the workload, but so far it has removed about 140 posts in two days of running, and I think we&#39;ve reinstated about 5 posts whose OP had subsequently added a submission statement.</p>

<p>A few days ago I posted a (highly relevant) YouTube link in response to a comment on a post in this sub. It was instantly gone when I refreshed the page (less than 5 seconds later). Is this because I didn’t add any commentary on the link (I posted only the URL)?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You posted it as a comment or as a link post? Comments should be fine with no submission statements; only link posts are affected. Unless you&#39;ve recently deleted your post/comment history, I don&#39;t see any record of your post/comment being removed by us, which I would if the bot or another mod removed it. When the bot removes a post, it will always make a reply to your post first, which you would see in your regular inbox. And unless it&#39;s malfunctioning, it shouldn&#39;t even touch any post less than 20 minutes old, and I haven&#39;t gotten any other feedback that it is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I got to say, it is really nice to see some of the self.posts and more conspiracy-related stuff get to stay on the front page long enough now so that the discussions can develop and evolve a little bit. Before the rule change many of these posts would just get forum-slid down before anyone in the new queue could see them. Many of the posts I am seeing on the front page would have never had a chance to mature and age at all before the rule change.</p>

<p>I have my front page set to 50 submissions and I have to say that the difference between now and before is night and day. This actually <em>feels</em> like more of a conspiracy sub now. It&#39;s not perfect, but I like the results I am seeing so far.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I disagree. The mods are volunteers, the majority of the sub agreed to submission statements as a requirement and it is most efficient to have that policed in an unbiased manner. The last thing we need around here are endless shitshow arguments about mods removing posts based on the subjectivity of whether the title is substantive enough to qualify. And then we would have the problem of user-created titles being reported for being misleading. A SS comment solves a lot of problems and reduces workload.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. I mean how hard is it to post a few sentences of context on your link? It&#39;s encourages debate in the comments and gives people context for the link, as well as give discernment on whether people should click the link or not in the first place (Is it any good? Am I truly interested in this? Do I want to click and learn more or do I pass on this one?).</p>

<p>Ideally people should argument their links even more, but that is probably already a step too far.</p>

<p>People are afraid that mods will remove links with these statements if they don&#39;t agree with them. That&#39;s simply nonsense and I do not see it happening at all.</p>

<p>If anyone truly finds the mods are removing submission statements because they don&#39;t like the content (and not because the statement is a copy of the article, one sentence long or just absolutely absurd drivel) then screenshot it and make a thread about it, with obvious evidence of a good submission statement (a few sentences long, not copied...abiding by the above rules which <em>say nothing about the content of the statement apart from it not being copied</em>) being trashed. Then we can argue how the mods are shills. Based on my personal observation of this sub I do feel most mods here (or all of them, I cannot speak for everyone though) are genuine and want to make this sub a better place. </p>

<p>I&#39;d also encourage anyone that argues against these statements (and this thread will soon be filled with them) to state you suggestions on how to improve the sub. This will show who the shills are and who is a genuine user that wants to improve debate. </p>

<p>Disagreeing is absolutely fine, however simply disagreeing without suggestions amounts to fruitless discussions with no productive value.</p>

<p>My personal suggestion (as stated in another comment below) would be having a few days a week (or at least one day), text post only. Text posts encourage a lot more debate and links can always be included in them (more than one even), with even more context and concise arguments to boot.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You posted it as a comment or as a link post? Comments should be fine with no submission statements; only link posts are affected. Unless you&#39;ve recently deleted your post/comment history, I don&#39;t see any record of your post/comment being removed by us, which I would if the bot or another mod removed it. When the bot removes a post, it will always make a reply to your post first, which you would see in your regular inbox. And unless it&#39;s malfunctioning, it shouldn&#39;t even touch any post less than 20 minutes old, and I haven&#39;t gotten any other feedback that it is.</p>

<p>Maybe try posting again?</p>
