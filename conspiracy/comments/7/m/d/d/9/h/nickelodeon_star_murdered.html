        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Crazy as it sounds Im convinced about it. The girl that is showned as Amanda Bynes is not her at all. If you google Amanda BYnes 2017 all the photos of her of a fatter girl wearing glasses and is always next to another woman that it looks like a guard or something weird. If you look at the last of interview of  amanda Bynes it really sounds fake,the girl is an actress and her profile is always showed,you never see a front angle of her face. The  instagram of her only shows 13 pictures which are most of them old.</p>

<p>i remember that the girl went crazy and post crazy things on twitter.. I really believe that she was going to expose Dan Schneider and she was murdered.</p>

<p>The mother of Janette Macurdy died too and I read somewhere that she acussed nickelodeon of pedo stuff too. </p>

<p>remember that not along time ago Jamie Lyn Spears daughter was hurt in an accident.. what if it wasnt an accident? what if somebody try to hurt the girl to shut up the spears family?</p>

<p>what about the photos of vanessa hudgens and janette mcurdy that were leaked? probablly these pictures were taked by pedo nickelodeon producers.</p>

<p>I never watched zoey101,victorius of all those shows because Im older that those stars,Im here because of crazy days and nights website.</p>

<p>not a coincidence that all the disney stars become crazy..</p>

<p>this is my theory: all this disney nickelodeon spierlberg kids were abuse. These kids didnt knew what abuse was because they grow up there,it was common so they thought it was something natural. They never questionate anything. Those child stars dont even used to go to school,they probablly had tutors on set. So.. when they go out to the real world they realized that they were abused and that they were sold by their parents so imagine what a shock right? to discover that your parents sold you as hamburgers to get money so that is why they end up so messed up.. the reality hits. They canot say the truth because they are going to be considered  crazy or drugadicts and if they speak they probally are going to get murdered. And the ones that become big stars .. the ones that make it in mtv like britney,ariana,christina etc? well they and their families probally know about all this but they preffer look to the other side and continuing keeping the secret as the money continue to show up. imagine if you were in that position what would you do? would you go against a giant as nickeloden,mtv spielberg or would you shut up and close your eyes to get your paycheck? money moves everything.. probally all the people on nickeloden sets knew about dan schneider pedo things but the look to the other side oterwise they would lose their jobs. Just think about this if disney,nickelodeon,steven spielberg studios close imagine all the people that would lost their jobs so its easy to imagine why nobody wants to expose this open secret...</p>

There is this thing called &quot;rest of the world&quot;, reddit is not restricted to &#39;murica or Uk, even if most of you like to think that.<br/>
Really no need to be such an asshole about it, it&#39;s only discouraging people from sharing their thoughts.    </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Always be wary of the bias you create when you start actively being aware of these things. The more you look for it the more you&#39;ll find it.  Be your own devils advocate to dig deeper.  The deeper you go the less proof you need on any occasion to assume the worst.  I&#39;ll top that off with the fact that the cia literally creates a multitude of psyop conspiracies and fuels them so the truth hides among fiction.  The biggest conspiracy tptb have against people with our mindset is to break them.   They want us hopeless and confused.  Fuck that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dave Chappelle was replaced by a clone. After being deceived into believing he could have the Chappelle Show back with full creative control, Dave Chappelle was cloned then murdered. The Dave Chappelle you see today is NOT the original.</p>

<p>Basically back in the height of the Chappelle Show days, execs pulled Dave into a room and basically told him he had to stop making black people look dumb on the show. They said he could keep on making white people look ridiculous, but to stop dumbing down the black people. Many believe the execs wanted this because it was right around the time they were ushering Barack Obama into the &quot;presidency&quot; of the US &amp; they needed the sheeple to be more comfortable with the idea of an intelligent black man. Dave actually refused to do what they asked because he believed it was morally corrupt. He said he had to keep it equal. He wasn&#39;t going to just only make fun of white people. He wanted full creative control over the show but the execs weren&#39;t having it</p>

<p>After this meeting Dave apparently was feeling pretty scared and around this time is when he fled to Africa. Upon his return to the US the REAL Dave Chappelle expressed his intentions to go back to his roots and only do stand-up. Throughout this time Dave was VERY afraid for his life and can be seen looking visibly uncomfortable during an interview with Oprah Winfrey post-return to the US. Dave interviews with multiple people and his commentary cannot be ignored. He spoke a lot about his mental health and how he was just trying to take care of himself, get healthy..Some of his messages alluded to certain conspiracies..Seems like he was getting ready to blow a bigger whistle.</p>

<p>Then the execs contact Dave with this incredible offer. They want him to do the Chappelle Show again, but this time with full creative control, they said. No jerking him around, making him use their content or push their messages. Dave thought he was in line to get everything he ever wanted. So he met up with the execs and essentially signed a blood contract for the Chappelle Show in exchange for i think like $3 million? A lot of money was involved. After signing the contract Dave was taken somewhere under the premise of being shown a new studio/set for the show. He was actually taken to a cloning center where they cloned him, and then murdered him. </p>

<p>The Dave Chapelle you see today is a clone. He was murdered. If you have love for this man please give him the respect of researching his story. He was a good man and he honestly stayed true to us until the end.  All he wanted was to speak to us without their filter. They deceived him into believing he could have that. They did that so they could successfully clone him and get his image for their new Chappelle Show</p>

<p>REST IN PEACE </p>

All of this was broadcast pretty publicly via her social media. Fortunately she went to rehab, got off social media, and apparently got clean. She seemingly gained a lot of weight in the process, and possibly got some plastic surgery. She was pretty messed up at the time, so having a different personality now doesn&#39;t seem shocking.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>On /tv/ there was a suggestion why despite how suspicious Dan &#39;hold her tighter while I bust a nut insider her&#39; Schnider is so untouchable is because he&#39;s protected for multiprong reasons.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>he makes Nickelodeon a shit ton of money. Basicly he&#39;s made them billions from mid 90&#39;s forward. The money he&#39;s made could afford bribes for the entire state of California.</p></li>
<li><p>what was his 1st tv role? It was as a tv nerd. How did he get the roll? He worked multiple years in LA doing computer work, then setting up networks for big studios, the suddenly someone liked the cut of his jib.....</p></li>
<li><p>why is the work in computers important? Rumor is Dan &quot;get in my van&quot; Schneider was smart, went through the hard drives, got black mail, met the right people into what hes into and gave them the offer of &quot;hey, I&#39;m into what you guys are into as well but you guys gotta be smart. I can set up your stuff so you arent vulnerable&quot;. Try getting him into acting but no one likes him, so how do you make someone like him remotely fuckable to tweens? Making him the head of writing kids shows because he doesn&#39;t have to be the best at anything to be good at it.... But turns out he wasn&#39;t just good at kids shows he was great at it.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Dan Schneider is smart if the allegations are true. Rumor is he&#39;s still a tech guy and is very aware of all the rumors and rather than let the Streisand effect happen trying to delete fucking everything, he pays writters to say its a conspiracy theory. Even if he gets caught red handed he will most likely negotiate his way free because he has blackmail on every big name and can negotiate his way free. Others protect him because if he falls they fall, alledgedly.</p>
