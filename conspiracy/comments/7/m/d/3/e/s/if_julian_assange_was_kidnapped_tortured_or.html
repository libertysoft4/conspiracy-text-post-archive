    <div class="md"><p>This is what I believe. I think he&#39;s been working with the Trump administration behind the scenes to bring to light bullet proof dirt on many big guns in Washington and abroad.</p>

<p>It&#39;s taking a long time for obvious reasons, but when this stuff comes out, it&#39;ll completely up-end the globalists and change the world in a big way. WikiLeaks will essentially cease to exist (at least as it once was), but Assange + Trump admin are certainly making it a worthwhile sacrifice.</p>

<p>No proof, but this is my guess. It makes sense to me more than any other explanations</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I disagree.  If he was kidnapped or killed and WL announced that in October people would have gone absolutely nuts.  Similar to how they will react if Mueller indicts Trump and the theory that Mueller is one of our guys is wrong.  </p>

<p>It would be the single greatest rallying cry by WL ever and would make Julian a martyr.  </p>

<p>In fact as we know in the blockchain were messages from WL telling us our conspiracy theories about his health and what happened were detrimental to the movement and they told us to stop.  WL and Julians absolute silence to this day about what happened to him in October also suggests this.  He&#39;s never addressed those people on here and elsewhere who to this day are worried about him and genuinely want to see him freed and want to see him given a medal by Trump.  Had WL announced he was kidnapped in October it would have likely caused Hillary to be arrested I think.  WL would have posted the statement Hillary made about droning Assange, WL would release the proof the Trump Russia thing was a lie, and would say they murdered Assange.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Система Оперативно-Розыскных Мероприятий, literally &quot;System for Operative Investigative Activities&quot;) is the technical specification for lawful interception interfaces of telecommunications and telephone networks operating in Russia. The current form of the specification enables the targeted surveillance of both telephone and Internet communications. Initially implemented in 1995 to allow access to surveillance data for the FSB, in subsequent years the access has been widened to other law enforcement agencies.</p>

<p>The latest expansion....</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A ministerial order from the Russian Ministry of Communications from 16 April 2014 introduced requirements for the new wiretapping system SORM-3. Telecommunications operators were required to install compliant equipment by 31 March 2015.[7]</p>

<p>Propping up Syria, for one. The damage of Russia propping up Assad outweighs the deaths in Afghanistan and Iraq and ISIS twice over. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The way i understand it, assange said never to trust WL if they couldn&#39;t dole out the authentication. Thats why the PGP was created in the 1st place. Seems silly to create an crytokey and never to use it.</p>

<p>Why not just release the authentication if its so damn useless? Wonder wonder wonder.</p>

<p>I agree on all of that and think Assange is probably alive and being kept in the embassy, but I would just like to say that most of the anons don&#39;t have any &#39;inside knowledge&#39; they&#39;re probably neckbeards who want to kill some time and make themselves feel special or something like that, take Q for example didn&#39;t he predict Pelosi will get indicted or something a few weeks ago?</p>
