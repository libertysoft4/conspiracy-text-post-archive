<p>You are using &#39;scarcity&#39; instead of &#39;demand&#39;. If we had a scarcity of houses, they would be valuable because there wouldn&#39;t be any houses. But no, there is a demand for nicer houses, causing them to be more expensive. However, they are too expensive here, because of artificially inflated prices. Leaving some houses to just sit empty for long periods of time. Some pretty much abandoned. We could use the abandoned ones to house our homeless, to help get them back on their feet.</p>

<p>You can do this for free. It would be rough and time consuming, but you could do it. Society has made it a lot less rough and time consuming with the implementation of money, which eliminates the need for you to do all of the rough and time consuming things in order to experience the rewarding things you noted. </p>
