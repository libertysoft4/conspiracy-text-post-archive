As a scientist I&#39;m quite impressed with the level of their detail. The documentary was thorough, convincing and disturbing if it is true, even partially. The fact that I&#39;m left with less questions at the end is a testament to their attention to detail. </p>

<p>However, I have one burning question. If the planes were in fact replaced with drones, as the documentary states, what are the theories for the fate of the passengers and the crew? </p>

<p>Edit: There is the obvious answer which sends chills up my spine. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Given that the US government had the ability to modify those aircraft to become remotely piloted drones (see: <a href="http://www.boeing.com/commercial/aeromagazine/aero_02/textonly/fo02txt.html">Boeing Future Air Navigation System</a>, fitted to 757 and 767 aircraft) that seems rather redundant.</p>

<p>By simply hot swapping a module in the Flight Management Computer System as part of &quot;routine maintenance&quot;
(<a href="http://www.boeing.com/commercial/aeromagazine/aero_05/textonly/ps02txt.html">an ability built into 757 and 767 aircraft</a>) the aircraft used on Sept 11 could be turned into remotely piloted drones commanded from the ground by disabling the ability for the pilots to override course instructions sent from outside the aircraft.</p>

<p>Given that ability, wouldn&#39;t it be easier and safer to simply remotely hijack actual commercial flights (passengers and all) and crash them into the buildings?</p>

<p>Could the reason Flight 93 crashed be less to do with the passengers fighting hijackers on the aircraft, and more to do with the conspirators making sure that no one discovered there weren&#39;t any, or if there were, they didn&#39;t have actual control of the aircraft?</p>

<p>Even more importantly... the evidence that these aircraft had been hijacked remotely would be destroyed in the crashes, and there would be plenty of human remains to &quot;legitimise&quot; the official story.</p>

<p>Not at all. The Boeing 757 and 767 are very similar on a mechanical level. They use servomechanisms instead of fly-by-wire (FBW), which makes it difficult to over-ride control by the pilots. </p>

<p>In order to set up a 757 or 767 for remote control, the aircraft would need to be extensively modified. These alterations could be detected by the ground crew at Logan airport. So that requires more people to be &#39;in on it.&#39; </p>

Human life means nothing to those that played a part in this.  Certainly not of ordinary citizens, anyway.

    <div class="md"><p>People refuse to understand what psychopaths (or a group of them) would be capable of if given blank checks.

Do they have any idea of the sort of people that run the military?  These are people who wait their entire careers to fuck shit up with fancy toys.</p>

<p>Christopher Bollyn says that it was a simple matter of having two remote planes ready, and swapped them out.  He showed there was time and reason to believe it with flight paths and times.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure, but I&#39;m not sure how that fits into various theories.  I believe most believe the system used to pilot the plane remotely, makes a bulge along the fuselage, as seen in some of the photos.  If it had that system in place, it would be too noticeable to the public perhaps (necessitating a switch)? Christopher Bollyn goes into this stuff at length.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, all of the footage of the planes is fake. When viewed objectively they are just CGI composites. If something hit the buildings, it would have to be well-hidden or covered up with this video editing, but no kind of aircraft could have penetrated all the way into one of the twin towers. </p>

<p>For them to have been drones, it would have had to look enough like a plane to serve the purpose of fooling people on the ground, but also make it in the buildings without spilling its parts down the sides of the towers on impact.  That just seems as improbable to me as holograms, and the truth is if something is shown on television that&#39;s enough to fool enough people. Or at least it was at the time. </p>

<p>No plane theory is unfalsifiable by its very definition. Its central tenet is that every single photograph or video taken at the WTC complex is fake. </p>

<p>If I&#39;m wrong, then answer a simple question: Would it be possible for anyone to convince you that the pictures or videos of planes are real? What steps would they need to follow to convince you? What is your criteria for accepting or dismissing evidence?</p>

<p>The twin towers were built to survive the impact of a jumbo jet. NOT to prevent a jumbo jet from penetrating its outer frame. These two things are not identical.</p>
