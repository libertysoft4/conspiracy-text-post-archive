    <div class="md"><p>Hang on are you trying to argue that if a private company chooses to delete data off their private database, server, blob or cluster, that that is a violation of your rights? Does that mean if I send you a virus you are obliged to keep it too? Where does it end? If I send you a physical letter would it be a violation of my freedom of speech if you destroyed that letter?</p>

<p>Reddit, FB, YT, Twitter, Google are all private companies. They don&#39;t owe you storage. You can give them data (personal data or data in the form of posts or images or anything) but they don&#39;t owe you a place to keep it. And if they find something that they own that they don&#39;t like they have every right to delete it.</p>

<p>The only difference would be if you were paying them to keep your data and they didn&#39;t. But that again isn&#39;t a violation of freedom of speech, that would be breaking a contract or maybe destruction of property? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re arguing the law which I&#39;ll address second. The word censor exists outside the law as well. Free speech exists as a concept which is also embedded in law.</p>

<p>Twitter and Reddit were  advocates of a no censorship and free speech platform. </p>

<p>Such ideals are essential to democracy.  Sadly the main proponent of Reddit as such a platform is no longer with us.</p>

<p>Twitter change is also indicative of a very powerful oligarchy.</p>

<p>These companies have a responsibility as Americans no matter the party to promote these ideals.</p>

&#39;Common carrier&#39; and utility company status. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No I&#39;m sorry there was some break down in communication. I want to know if you think a private company or person who is offering you a free service is under obligation to store your shit on their database/blob/server. And for me the important point here is about the actual storage of the data. To be clear I consider this a conceptual issue and technical issue primarily. That&#39;s why I asked you about you storing my shit, or you storing a physical letter. </p>

<p>The issue of wether they are a common carrier or a utility (I can&#39;t find any information on this) or not is the legal debate. I&#39;m personally more interested in the conceptual and technical issues, but absolutely concede that if they have a legal obligation to store your shit then they are breaking the law by not doing so.</p>

<p>As for the importance of free speech to a democracy I 100% agree. I&#39;ve seen nothing to make me think Reddit is an advocate of free speech (every single subreddit I&#39;ve been on has had rules about what types of posts will be removed) and I don&#39;t use Twitter but I expect them to also have a list of terms and conditions about what types of content they will store and share for you. But again the legality is for me secondary, I&#39;m more interested in your technical and conceptual position.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I love this concept. And will begrudgingly argue against it. Before I do I love the concept bc it is bases in reality.</p>

<p>Courts have been very reluctant to see it for what it is, my property. Emails, phone data, computer hard drives are only recently getting the protection they deserve.</p>

<p>Now. Yes it should be required. </p>

<p>Can a restaurant deny people based in their race? They have to allow them in.</p>

<p>Can a person keep utility off their property? In some instances no.</p>

<p>So there are some encroachments. </p>

<p>Already newspapers are subject to rules regarding candidate access as well as television.</p>

<p>Currently there are no like requirements on fb, Twitter, yt or Reddit.</p>

<p>One of the questions is what burden is there.</p>

<p>Store 100 tins of fish. Very different than 100 mb of text.</p>

<p>Truckers pay a road tax bc big trucks destroy highways. A use tax.</p>

<p>So the million dollar question is can/should massive speech platforms be subjected to such requirements.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think your analogy is a poor one. If the internet company is like a restaurant the customer of the restaurant would be the advertisers/people who buy your personal data. So to carry on your analogy, we would be the restaurants suppliers who are giving the restaurant their produce (in this case our data). And while the restaurant can&#39;t deny service to customers based on race, they can absolutely choose not to buy from a supplier based on race. That is to say you do not need to give a reason for not buying something from someone (or in this case taking it for free) which goes back to what I was saying. An internet company not storing data they&#39;ve been given for free is like a restaurant not buying produce, they don&#39;t need to give a reason. You should not, as a private company or person, need to give a reason for not buying something or taking something for free.</p>

<p>Again this is all different if the company is a utility and is providing a service and that these services should be very heavily regulated or even made public. Which is a very liberal/left-wing point of view.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah but I&#39;m afraid it&#39;s a necessary way to respond. Again you say &gt;A newspaper can&#39;t sell ad space or copies only to whites</p>

<p>But you&#39;re not buying from these companies. The issue is not can a newspaper refuse to sell ads to people,  it&#39;s can a newspaper refuse to cover a story. Clearly they can. They can&#39;t deny work to a journalist on the grounds of race but clearly they can on the basis of the journalists content. Which is what we&#39;re talking about.</p>

<p>And yes without us their site is useless. That still doesn&#39;t make us their customers. I mean when was the last time you actually paid Facebook? Or Twitter? </p>

<p>As for your opinion on the structure of my response frankly yours could do with plenty of work. But I consider that a sufficient digression to suggest we aren&#39;t getting anywhere. So I&#39;ll leave it here.</p>

<p>I told you I think these analogies are poor, and this is sort of why. I&#39;m not sure what point you&#39;re trying to make here - that a news paper is obligated to publish every story that gets submitted? I think (hope) that isn&#39;t what you&#39;re trying to say, but either way it&#39;s not very useful to us.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Assange ban is the canary in the mine shaft.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At the end of the day you and I are both concerned about free speech, the difference is that I think Twitter banning people is not a violation of free speech. To me this is a technical issue, and at the risk of offending you, it seems like you possibly don&#39;t have the requisite knowledge of the technical details to understand the arguement I&#39;m making.</p>

<p>The reason I brought this up is that it worries me slightly to see a serious topic, the suppression of free speech, getting mixed up in trivial issues. By conflating these two - separate - things you undermine the severity of the issue while also putting the autonomy of these platforms at risk. If you think Twitter owes people a platform to share their views you put incredible, stifling, pressure on them and ultimately everyone. Because what you&#39;re saying is that once I give you access to write to my tables I need your permission to delete from it too. And you should absolutely be frightened of the implications of that. </p>

<p>The final thing is that the reason I&#39;m not worried about Assange is that there isn&#39;t anything stopping him from starting his own version of Twitter, or his own Facebook, or his own YouTube, or news website, or email service, or wiki or whatever.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>See net neutrality? Come on man you said before you&#39;d explain this to me, that you couldn&#39;t at the time, and yet you still haven&#39;t. These are just sounds bites. The FCC is by definition against the free market - it is attempting to keep the industry &#39;fair&#39; by imposing regulations. Which is why Trump and a shit Patel are trying to dismantle it. A free market is by definition a market without regulations. I mean you say see net neutrality but yeh you should go see it. A shit Patel is literally saying these regulations are anti competition - he called them &#39;Obama era regulations&#39;.
And so yes an oligarchy is a free market. If your market has no rules (is free) there are no rules against oligarchies forming. And no silencing voices is not akin to communism. And oligarchy is not akin to fascism. You&#39;re confusing completely discreet concepts because of how certain political ideas were implemented in history. 
Which is surprising coming from someone in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. Wouldn&#39;t think you&#39;d be swallowing the party line...</p>

<p>True.</p>

<p>The oligarchy is essentially that. It&#39;s implied that the oligarchy becomes one with the government each scratching each other&#39;s back. It&#39;s crazy but analysis brings it to that conclusion.</p>

<p>False. I mean I&#39;m sure your analysis brings you to that conclusion - but that doesn&#39;t make you right. You don&#39;t need to have an oligarchy in Communism. There isn&#39;t anything stopping you having many small state owned companies in competition with each other and strict anti-monopoly regulations to stop them forming oligopolies. I&#39;m not saying this is what would happen, or even should happen, just that people are capable of it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I think I&#39;ve mostly described what common carrier and utility has to do with this. I&#39;m pretty sure you or someone responded and disagreed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>False. I mean I&#39;m sure you believe you think you explained how a micro blogging site should be considered a common carrier, but you didn&#39;t.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Basically special laws apply to private trains, planes and buses. They are called common carriers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>True. Though it worries me slightly that you think I wanted you to explain to me what a common carrier is (and this is what you came up with) and not why we should be considering microblogging websites common carriers.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Utilities have special laws that apply to them given their essential nature.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>True. Are you saying Twitter is essential? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>UN declared internet a basic human right</p>
</blockquote>

<p>True. But irrelevant. We&#39;re not taking about access to the internet, we&#39;re taking specifically and exactly about a microblogging websites duty to store your shit on their servers. Which is not the same thing. We&#39;re not even talking about whether you have access to their website.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Social platforms, akin to common carriers and essential, as to speech, like a utility.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Honestly barely coherent. Are you saying social platforms are akin to common carriers and are essential to free speech? I hope not, not because that&#39;s wrong - but because it&#39;s just you stating the same thing for the third time without actually explaining it. I want to know why you think a microblogging website should be treated the same as an ISP. I don&#39;t want you to say they are the same because they are the same because they are the same. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think your analogy is a poor one. If the internet company is like a restaurant the customer of the restaurant would be the advertisers/people who buy your personal data. So to carry on your analogy, we would be the restaurants suppliers who are giving the restaurant their produce (in this case our data). And while the restaurant can&#39;t deny service to customers based on race, they can absolutely choose not to buy from a supplier based on race. That is to say you do not need to give a reason for not buying something from someone (or in this case taking it for free) which goes back to what I was saying. An internet company not storing data they&#39;ve been given for free is like a restaurant not buying produce, they don&#39;t need to give a reason. You should not, as a private company or person, need to give a reason for not buying something or taking something for free.</p>

<p>Again this is all different if the company is a utility and is providing a service and that these services should be very heavily regulated or even made public. Which is a very liberal/left-wing point of view.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah but I&#39;m afraid it&#39;s a necessary way to respond. Again you say &gt;A newspaper can&#39;t sell ad space or copies only to whites</p>

<p>But you&#39;re not buying from these companies. The issue is not can a newspaper refuse to sell ads to people,  it&#39;s can a newspaper refuse to cover a story. Clearly they can. They can&#39;t deny work to a journalist on the grounds of race but clearly they can on the basis of the journalists content. Which is what we&#39;re talking about.</p>

<p>And yes without us their site is useless. That still doesn&#39;t make us their customers. I mean when was the last time you actually paid Facebook? Or Twitter? </p>

<p>As for your opinion on the structure of my response frankly yours could do with plenty of work. But I consider that a sufficient digression to suggest we aren&#39;t getting anywhere. So I&#39;ll leave it here.</p>
