<p>Looking back, news hosts laughs at what Adams was telling them encapsulates the whole newstainment industry.</p>

And what do you know, the fucker wins. Ann coulter also got laughed at live for saying Trump was going to win.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a bold face lie.  Adams did not support Trump at all, he admitted he disliked Trump.  He then said he would vote for Trump after Trump said he would get rid of the estate tax and Hillary said she supported the estate tax.</p>

<p>He boasts about calling Trump for president and discusses why he thinks Trump is a clever man. It’s weird because he gushes about him while trying to distance himself from being a supporter. I guess you can admire from afar, but Sam presses a few times and puts him in positions he probably hasn’t been in before that challenge his views.</p>
