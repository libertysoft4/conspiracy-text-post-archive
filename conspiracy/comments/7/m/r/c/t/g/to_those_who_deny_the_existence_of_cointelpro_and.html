    <div class="md"><p>Because they might want to learn how to psychologically de-construct people in a plausibly deniable manner.  If thousands of dissidents all started to suddenly drop dead of heart attacks or ricin poisoning, people may just get the clue that something is up.  If they can convince a lot of people to kill themselves after they make themselves out to be crazy, then they not only have more knowledge of how to weaponize psychology, but also have some problem people cleaned up in a nice and tidy fashion.  We live in a country that spends more on war, weapons, and propaganda than any other country that has ever existed.  We also live in a country with a documented history of non-consensual human experimentation, false flags, lying to the public, and psychological warfare against dissidents.  That&#39;s why they may not necessarily think that they have better things to do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You ask the same ?&#39;s as many do(me included).   One of the best vids I&#39;ve seen that describes &quot;why&quot; the best, to me that is, is this video:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grdm2okSToQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grdm2okSToQ</a></p>

<p>Whether that is all true or not, gives reasons for why someone like us(you) would get such attention.  The resources being used are going to be constantly refined.  They will us those like us to do that.   Am I special? Not in the slightest.  Do I feel that the time and resources that would be used for stuff like this is, is a wise use of those resources on someone like me.  Not in the slightest.  But then again those like us have no clue what the reasons are at all and most could just be a way to  test their tech and techniques to improve them for when they need to use against a high value target.  And I say all of this as someone who isn&#39;t being hararrassed, not like many describe, and still have doubts about the whole thing.  But then I listen to the vid link I posted above and it always makes me think, &quot; maybe.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let me first say I believe you 100% (I knew a fellow pizzagate researcher that went through something similar).  I would recommend trying the Scientology approach; anytime you see them pull out your phone, hit record and confront them (record the license plates too).  If you notice the same person or car a few times, make a police report (for documentation only, I think it&#39;s unlikely they&#39;ll do much).  With video evidence and a license plate you should be able to get them into court, reveal their identity ( where/who they work for) and potentially even get some money out of it.</p>

<p>Secondly i could just be used as a practice target or test subject</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah, that&#39;s what I was thinking. It&#39;s not like you were driving out of state to Sandy Hook to interview people or anything hard hitting like that. You were just sharing an opinion online like a million other people do.</p>

<p>All people will say is get help or talk to somebody.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nah. You don&#39;t sound like the typical delusional pulling connections out of thin air. If you&#39;re full of shit it&#39;s because you&#39;re a disinfo agent trying to scare people away from investigating Sandy Hook/Pizzagate.</p>

<p>At best all i could do is file a complaint with the d.o.j. AKA the same people who probably are involved with this.</p>

<p>Ya I do hope I never suffer from a mental illness, you act like one option is better than the other.  If this guy truly has a network of people stalking him to ruin his life he&#39;s fucked anyways, ruling out and seeking help for a mental condition is a good idea.  </p>

What if the &#39;ramblings&#39; of a &#39;crazy person&#39;, that is, extreme paranoia, is sometimes warranted based on experience of a &#39;non crazy person&#39;? That doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re mentally ill.</p>

<p>And yes, one option would be better than the other. An illness is treatable and healable. Do you know how to solve this kind of stalking? A shotgun? Note very state allows that unfortunately. hah. Maybe the solution is move to Texas?</p>

<p>Don&#39;t you see the parallel? The slippery slope?</p>

<p>Isn&#39;t it possible that despite what &#39;may appear to be&#39;, this person could be telling the truth and isn&#39;t crazy at all? With this thinking that means anybody who suffers these experiences at the hands of sociopaths are therefore crazy and &#39;need help&#39;, maybe they do need help, but I don&#39;t think medication from big pharma is gonna help.</p>

<p>Huh. I thought they did that to people to be arbitrary. Hm, maybe they do do it at random, but mostly so they can dull down the reaction when they have a specific reason they want to ask someone for ID?</p>

<p>So this was over a Sandy Hook Facebook post? Huh. </p>

<p>And yeah, following you into the parking lot, sitting there for 20 minutes, and then following you when you leave seems too unlikely to be a coincidence. Particularly as someone who was by chance not going into the store, but not trying to follow you, would have noticed that it looks like they were and waited a few minutes after you left before they left. People get self-conscious about that kind of thing and try to avoid creeping other people out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hmm to be honest im not sure. Its a very special case because they did break the law but they proved those tasked with enforcing the law and certain ethics were violating people rights.</p>

<p>So its very unique its like let me say something crazy really fast. Lets say there was an island where rich people had security posted on the island and lookouts to stop people from finding the secret child enslavement sex dungeon on the island okay. Lets spice it up a bit and make it sound like a blockbuster movie. A group of rouge vigilanties storm the island kill and take out multiple government agents record it all amd rescue all the captured children.</p>

<p>Its like they murdered a bunch of government workers stormed and island etc and clearly broke countless laws etc but in doing sl validated and proved that select government officials were molesting and trafficking children in the process.</p>

<p>Like if something that crazy happened you would have to say well how is punishment decided when somebody breaks the law to expose those tasked with enforcing it of multiple human rights violations?</p>

<p>In the case of mr forsyth and the citizens comission they do nothing as crazy as the made up action packed scenario i just used as an example but im sure they broke multiple laws.</p>

<p>Breaking and entering obstruction of federal property stealing classified documents etc the list goes on. However only by breaking the law did we all learn the fbi was breaking the supreme law of the land the constitution and violating peoples rights.</p>

<p>Its like they cant punish them because they were proven to be corrupt? Its very interesting to think about. Its actually what makes what they did so fascinating the fbi was forced to publically announce those operations were &quot;supposedly&quot; terminated.</p>

<p>They were only announced as terminatef i dont believe they actually were but announced as such because of what the comission did.</p>

<p>It would be like if i broke into a police station and knocked out police officers to obtain proof they were trafficking weapons or drugs. Its like does somebody who does something that extreme or law breaking go to jail or face punishment for breaking the law to prove the enforcers of the law are doing such things?</p>

<p>Mr forsyth was pretty young when he did this i think he said he wasnt sure what would happen to them. I am still shocked they were brave enough to do it and actually find the evidence they needed and pull it off.</p>

<p>I have to watch the full documentary i dont know ALL of the details only some. I want to know how they knew what office and how they did it the whole process.</p>

<p>Its just interesting to wonder what can be done to somebody by the law of they break the law to prove the enforcers of the law at the highest level are violating peoples rights. It in essence proves they should not be tasked with such responsibility while at the same time dont know its tricky.</p>

<p>It has been well over 40 years since the incident and well its not like they came back empty handed they came back with concrete proof. If there was a statute of limitations its likley it would be up.</p>

<p>If he came forward maybe he feels safe enough to do so or is getting older and is not afraid anymore.</p>

<p>For me the most interesting thing is i never thought avout that. How the law or government is allowed to handle somebody who breaks the law in order to provide the cou try with indisputable proof of its corruptions.</p>

<p>Thats why nost journalists and people who try and testify to expose these things through the proper safe law abiding channels get &quot;assasinated&quot;.</p>

<p>Monica peterson was clearly assasinated to when these people take the law abiding approach they are eliminated it seems. So it would imply there would have been no other way for the commission to get the truth aside from breaking into the office.</p>

<p>If they pressured the government wrote letters and garnered public attention they and there efforts would probably have been quashed.  By straight up ignoring the law and breaking and entering and obtaining proof they did what many who take the legal way are trying to do but cant by abiding by the restrictions of the law.</p>

<p>Its like snowden he proved rights are being violated but hes still wanted. I like you wonder what the statue of limitations on that would be.</p>

<p>The fact that they did that leta me know they are clearly very intellegent and capable people if he feels safe to come forward there must be a good reason.</p>

<p>In any regard doesnt seem like they can touch him now. But we still have to remember not ALL the members have come out of the shadows so there is probably some other legal stuff in there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, of course both can exist - my issue is why does the existence of one suggest the existence of the other.</p>

<p>They could be correlated though, if a person is harassed enough times they might suffer from some trauma. But that does not mean what is being reported is inaccurate or that the person is unfit to report it, but that&#39;s not the paradigm, regardless of what you mean or intend. That&#39;s why it&#39;s a slippery slope.</p>

<p>It&#39;s similar to what the official response to the Phoenix lights was. &#39;Mass delusion&#39;? They were all unfit because they saw something strange? That&#39;s the problem I&#39;m addressing here.</p>

<p>Mental health and reporting harassment are two entirely separate issues and should remain completely separated, especially since the OP&#39;s story has **<strong><em>NOTHING</em></strong>*** to do with mental health. YOU brought that up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One does not suggest the existence of the other, and I haven’t seen anyone state that.</p>

<p>The existence of mental health issues that can cause paranoia, delusions of grandeur, and hallucinations (both audio and visual) lets us know that some people suffer from these issues. When someone presents with these symptoms you have to consider the possibility that those symptoms might indicate that they suffer from the mental issues that can cause them.</p>

<p>That’s all. No one is saying specifically because you claim gang stalking you must be crazy. However, believing you are the target of a grand conspiracy when there is nothing to suggest there is anything uniquely threatening about you, is a red flag. Asserting things that seem borderline impossible, or at the very least highly improbable, is a red flag.</p>

<p>If we are going to entertain the extraordinary claims that OP is putting forward, then we need to entertain them in a rational way. That means not blindly accepting them, and also considering other, more likely scenarios. </p>

If you are not willing to entertain a valid alternative explanation then it’s not much of a conversation.

    <div class="md"><p>targeting is not carried out only by government projects or police unions with lists of people they are ordered to eliminate but this could be carried out very easily by renegade employees in the government or law enforcement, </p>

<p>I have relatives who used the same exact techniques over succession, </p>

<p>They used our younger sister and her girlfriends to defame older brothers to their spouses/girlfriends relatives with out us all even knowing it was them until private investigators traced all the mambo jumbo.</p>

<p>It was not just rumors that they where HIV positive but worse like they had a history of violence with women., and they did it in a very clever way with the advise and help of boyfriends retired from the navy and worked for the police department.</p>

<p>Their scheme would be to contact the relatives of their targets pretending their was a death in the family or something serious had happened so to make it appear as a panic situation., that the police are asking for their help and there is no time....once they get them into the mood to ask what exactly happened they would then ask them to promise not to reveal it to their target if where told, this worked 99 percent of the time.</p>

<p>from their they would claim their target had AIDS, a history of violence, claim to be direct victims of rape etc etc etc.., while telling lies to a 3rd party is called DEFAMATION, getting the suckers to participate in  crimes against the target is beyond that and criminal itself.</p>

<p>Its like a decent looking women telling a bouncer lies that she was groped by some guy to get him kicked out of a club but worse. </p>

<p>the perpetrators (siblings and their attorneys)  knew that our older brothers in laws where a bit racist so after they used our younger sister to camouflage themselves as victims and then offer to lie in the family court about his past if they wished not to see him anymore and use their grandchildren as a tool to force their daughter to stay in their lives.</p>

<p>He got court papers for visitations even when his in laws can see the kids.</p>

<p>but when he inspected the procedural history of the case he discovered that our younger sister used false allegations about our older brother depicting him as violent, claiming he also hit our sister including attacked me which i contested.</p>

<p>by the time the case was closed we have found out my sister and her cop fiancee cheated us out of a will left by our grandmother..</p>

<p>relatives in italy had told our sister that our grandmother died and all her grandchildren have to probate her will in the court of first instance after they publish it, so been we are all in the US if no one publishes this will a heir has two years to claim it which is why we had all been tied up in family court where they can file false allegations about anything including rape and sodomy yet its private and your gagged from reporting it.</p>

<p>When our brother tried to report it to the FBI he was threatened by a psychologist using the false allegations to assert he was mentally ill., so in fact you can gag anyone using the family court if that is the case.</p>

<p>This is all called targeting and its always linked to succession, whether its Saul cheating to take King DAVID&#39;s crown, a coupe or the destruction of other nuclear power nations to assure no one catches up with us in the arms race, targeting is part of succession.

For instance, say you looked at butt plugs on amazon last night or something.  If someone with intel agency resources wants to spook you out and harass you, they could very easily track your movement via cell phone the next day, and when you are at a public place hire a &quot;surveillance roleplayer&quot; to bug their eyes out at you and say, &quot;What a buttplug&quot;, or something to that effect.  Even if you recorded that person saying that, try going to your local authorities and having them take you seriously.  They have thousands upon thousands of ridiculous scripts and plausibly deniable ways of fucking with you after decades of research by the Gestapo, Stasi, FBI, CIA, and NSA.  They have a thousand little scripts and tricks like this that can drive people nuts - like sloppy driving, flashing hi-beams, or belching diesel smoke at you.  The psychological effects of this sort of activity are cumulative, and if the psychological effects alone are not enough to get the job done, you&#39;d better believe that they have EMF/scalar/Silent Sound Spread Spectrum weapons that are extremely difficult to record in the moment.  Most people simply do not have the resources to be able to contend with intelligence agency tactics that have been developed for decades and streamlined for plausible deniability.

<p>Like snowden exposed the surveillance and prism I believe. There are 3 ways to get the truth breaking into an institution and getting documents via the citizens commission way. </p>

<p>Holding one of the participants at gun point and forcing them to hand over their means of communication which may provide all needed evidence of who they are communicating to.</p>

<p>All I can think is that when that person followed me to that parking lot if I held them at gun point and made them get out of there car and give me there phone it would have given me hard evidence as to who they were speaking with. Then forcing them to talk. </p>

<p>It would be breaking the law to get the truth but the citizens commission did it and with my talents that&#39;s the only way I see myself able to get my hands on non plausibly deniable evidence.</p>

<p>Which is the perfect terminology you used to explain their tactics. They make sure everything they do to you can be plausibly denied.</p>

<p>Regardless of how it feels to you, the reality is that there are well known mental illnesses that can cause people to believe what you are experiencing. </p>

<p>Does that mean that’s for sure what’s happening here? No. But, the options an outsider is presented with is believe some random person is being targeted for some conspiracy they believe in (Note: there are literally thousands of people who believe and spread the same kind of information on this very sub who aren’t my experiencing gang stalking) or some random person is simply not perceiving the situation correctly and actually is suffering from well documented and understood problems. There is just no compelling reason to believe you are part of some elaborate plot based on what you’ve provided.</p>

<p>There is nothing about what you’ve said or believe that seems worth this effort, especially considering how many people I know that have said similar if not worse things and are still running around just fine. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Religion and faith are two different things.</p>

<p>I believe you if you say you mean well. But I also implore you to really look deeply into what you&#39;re saying to people.</p>

<p>I have no ability, I cannot - nay, I WILL not tolerate blind, sweeping statements about how &#39;crazy&#39; somebody is because they have the courage to talk about something deemed taboo.</p>

<p>You are acting stupid. There is NO LOVE IN IT. And I try SO damn hard not to be mean, but what you suggested? It&#39;s beyond mean, it&#39;s thoughtless, bland and lacks grace. Maybe there are people with mental health issues, probably are, maybe I&#39;m even one of them(can you admit or acknowledge that for yourself, that YOU might have a mental health issue? How does that make you feel, when somebody blindly dismisses you?), but that doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m not lucid.</p>

<p>This &#39;solid as stone&#39; mentality, that you know more than others, that this person is lesser - it just has to stop. I suggest you research these topics, what the CIA does, what they have admitted they do, the documents and collaborating stories. You&#39;re ignoring more than just one human&#39;s experience, you&#39;re suggesting because a professor somewhere tried to tell you &#39;what is&#39;, that you know better? Give me a break. What a lie.</p>

<p>Where is the acknowledgement that these events could have taken place? That&#39;s what I say, it&#39;s all -possible-, I don&#39;t claim to know the truth like you seem to. And what more, you seem able to determine all of this through text? What a joke! You don&#39;t know the OP&#39;s heart or mind, just like you don&#39;t know mine and at this point you never will, it&#39;s the likes of you that prevent change in the world because you&#39;re tugging along the same bs &#39;party line&#39; that has been force fed to all of us. Are you even aware of what I&#39;m talking about? If not, -why are you here-???</p>

<p>If love was actually behind your statements then you need to do some self evaluation please, maybe read up on leadership and the concepts behind it, because you don&#39;t know how to talk to people. And whether you like it or not, it&#39;s CHRISTIAN values that kept people behaving respectfully - as they fade, so fades wisdom, so fades love and what we get is dumb stuff like this that wastes our time ultimately and has us spinning our wheels.</p>

<p>Have you even thought about where you got that response? Why is a dismissive response even an option for you? Was it from the TV? A movie? The radio? You don&#39;t know this person, right? So how dare you suggest you do? And based on what exactly? Text? His story? The fact you don&#39;t like it?</p>

<p>I&#39;ll do everything in my power to make you and anybody else feel stupid when they act like this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes I am and I will continue to do so for those that make sweeping statements, those that neg others blindly, especially if the person&#39;s speaking of it has nothing to gain.</p>

<p>And I copy and paste: &#39;it&#39;s that most of the people who think it&#39;s happening to them are far more likely to be suffering from paranoid delusions and need to be seeking medical attention not feeding their mania online with other people who are in need of mental health care.&#39;</p>

<p>That&#39;s what upset me. Most people? What&#39;s this based on? Why even bring it up, as if this is the issue? Why is there a perceived, tv-driven correlation between people that speak and think differently to mental health? Why did you suggest this? It&#39;s a perspective that&#39;s based on a lie.</p>

<p>Being skeptical is one thing but to suggest mental health issues is such a dangerous slippery slope that even mentioning it is folly. Maybe I&#39;m expecting people to act stupid, probably am, I&#39;m compelled to respond, I can&#39;t help it. There are too many otherwise intelligent, good people that are too quick to dismiss others. But if I were mistaken, I apologize - but I do not regret anything, this culture of ridicule simply must stop one way or another.</p>

<p>That doesn’t mean all, but there is significant documentation of specific illnesses that lead to these exact beliefs and at times delusions, and the evidence that many of these people put out themselves is enough for a common person to see and realize that there is some confusion on the side of the person.</p>

<p>It’s simply the reality of the facts available. It is possible someone is the target of a grand conspiracy, however it is more likely that your average person is not.

    <div class="md"><p>Those that outwardly and harshly ridicule their fellow man are people I generally cannot tolerate. So yes, I do do that, unfortunately, but I also do it thoughtfully. I don&#39;t need to curse, in other words and I haven&#39;t yet here, not at a person anyway.</p>

<p>How do you know they&#39;re delusional? What I&#39;m defending here is what&#39;s possible because you don&#39;t know what is or isn&#39;t possible with this person. I see a lot of judgment, speaking frankly, because of the typo errors. It&#39;s text, we can&#39;t hear -how- we&#39;re speaking so what we have to judge is grammar and spelling.</p>

<p>And why didn&#39;t you post or write about it? It would be delusional to say you had people taking pictures of your house and to share your thoughts and experience? What part of that is delusional and how is this different from what this person did?</p>

<p>In the end, if this person is lying, it doesn&#39;t matter. I put love first and love would say to believe him and offer support if you can. What it doesn&#39;t tell me is to paint a broad slanderous picture of this person based on text and what he says. So I really don&#39;t understand your point of view and I don&#39;t think I want to. It seems like you&#39;re trying to tight-rope an imaginary line, the tricky part is the line isn&#39;t straight, it&#39;s jagged, filled with contradiction.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not perfect either. And I was probably too harsh. I apologized for it too. I still stand by what I said, the whole approach is wrong and I implore everybody to look inside and figure out where that point of view came from. Did it really come from you? Is it used as a defense mechanism so you don&#39;t feel uncomfortable? Did you base this point of view on all that you&#39;ve read? Because I&#39;ve looked at a lot of bad youtube videos too, disregard the ones that don&#39;t offer insight or information, although I also try to remember them even if they don&#39;t make sense. And I never, ever commented on any of them slanderous, broad stroked comments or suggested mental illness. It&#39;s rude, inconsiderate and unwise.</p>

<p>By the way, all of this discussion shouldn&#39;t be about belief. It shouldn&#39;t be about trying to change convictions or opinions. The whole point of a discussion is to throw around an idea - something that can be changed, to get people talking and thinking about it differently.</p>

<p>Almost everything I see here is about &#39;prove it to me&#39;, when it&#39;s not up to the OP to prove anything. It&#39;s not his job to educate you.  He&#39;s sharing an experience, of which does not and should not require anybody&#39;s slander to be accepted as what it is. This person&#39;s story, whether it&#39;s real or a lie, let&#39;s all hope it&#39;s a lie because that would mean a person isn&#39;t suffering inescapable torment in their personal life.</p>

<p>How could you possibly claim to know anything about another person or their experience? And to think, you&#39;re concerned about being &#39;normal&#39; here? On the conspiracy reddit? I think you&#39;re looking in the wrong place for that. Oh, just to verify, I&#39;m not on social media. I don&#39;t post any shit online either. But if I were being stalked, by whomever, bringing it up into the light is a good way to make it stop.</p>

If you have evidence of actual gangstalking, let me know. Don&#39;t bring up John Lang either, he&#39;s close to home and was a hero. These mentally ill in youtube are, for the most part, just taking videos of normal people and cause a public disturbance. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I tried but so much has happened that its hard to explain it all and im pressed for time. I just want wveryone to know I promise you and swear on my life everything i have told you is the truth.</p>

<p>Its because its true that sadly im forced to confirm sandyhook is fake and pizzagate is real. Because if I am truly wrong about all the things attention and awarness i have brought to people I would be left alone.</p>

<p>Its like the woman who leaked the panama papers who was killed. Was she killed because the evidence she had was fake or because it was real and she was right?</p>

<p>Im worried about the future of this world I worry that nobody can see these things and that nobody cares.</p>

<p>What I learned from monica peterson and the panama papers journalists is these people got there power because people are afraid to get hurt.</p>

<p>When your afraid to get hurt i guess you let people rule over you and live in fear.</p>

<p>If im to be harmed and the quality of my life degraded for spreading awarness and standing up for the truth then I truly would have it no other way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a car that drives by my apartment every single day and, and every single time the driver honks his car as he&#39;s passing. It started shortly after moving my apartment three years ago. At first it happen every morning around 4:30 with the driver laying the horn for the entire time it took for him to pass the entire length of the apartment complex. Now it happens during the afternoon with a quick honk. </p>

<p>My guess is they must have a friend or relative that lives in one of these apartments and they honk their horn as a way of saying hi. I could go around the complex asking if anyone knows the driver and if my guess is in fact true, but I&#39;m too lazy to do it and it doesn&#39;t really bother me all that much. </p>

<p>Nothing crazy has happened to me in the past 3 months a few minor things but nothing i would record. I aubmitted a complain to the d.o.j so whoever is involved with this is aware im aware for #1.</p>

<p>Number 2 anything i do record will be plausably deniable but as it stands i am always ready to record.</p>

<p>Had i been as paranoid and dellusional as some of you claim i would have been ready to record anything prior to me going through everything that happened and tryi g to make sense of it not afterward.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This also may seem unrelated but in as far as personal protection goes, I would recommend looking into getting yourself connected with a network of whistleblowers.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a big one I can think of, the Sirius Disclosure project and although your story doesn&#39;t necessarily have to do with them and their goals, unveiling a pedophile ring the sandy hook gun control nonsense is probably as important as free energy.</p>

<p>Although, one of the kickers regarding the Disclosure Project is many of them were once Govt employees and contractors that signed NDA&#39;s. The reason they aren&#39;t in trouble(are ignored) is because people like the president and congress does not know about/has no access to/has no control over these projects.</p>

<p>So, I&#39;m not sure if this would be appropriate but for your own sake I would contact them and share your story. The louder you are at this point the safer you&#39;re going to be and if you&#39;re connected with a network of people who would all move and act together if you are hurt or killed may be the wisest route.</p>

<p>Keep in mind, I don&#39;t know any of them. I just see what they have apparently done. It&#39;s worth a try, you never know, their issues may be different from yours but ultimately they are all branches connected to the same tree. I also say this cautiously too, keep in mind - I don&#39;t want it to seem like &#39;stated facts&#39;, but I would absolutely not go about this as a lone wolf if these things are really happening to you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah because everything that has happened to me is in fact real and not at all anything to do with mental illness I realized that I do myself a disservice by speaking amongst those who don&#39;t understand the complexity of these things etc.</p>

<p>What I was doing was trying to filter through the mentally ill who falsely believe they are being gangs talked and the ones who really are so we can compare notes etc</p>

<p>so your idea is a good one there is a lot more I haven&#39;t even shared on here and I can see its probably for the best. I am trying to find a group like the citizens commission or people who know more and who are smarter than me that can help better connect the dots of these things.</p>

<p>As far as being hurt goes im not afraid of that. The reason these people have the power they have is because to many people are afraid to be hurt so don&#39;t act.</p>

<p>Im not special and im not unique however one thing I am is unafraid. I wont live in fear of anything or anybody. I am armed and competent at all times should it ever come to that.</p>

<p>Before the people who scream mental illness paint me crazy no im not going on a random mass shooting spree lol. </p>

<p>But hell im clearly just mentally ill what do I know lol.</p>

<p>Anyways thank you I will look into those groups but right now I should probably go eat something im actually very tired and sleepy and hungry right now. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would recommend taking your time and carefully crafting your entire story. Lay it out, what people say and think don&#39;t matter, but getting the story out does.</p>

<p>Make sure you tell all your friends and family this stuff. That if you end up sick, in a car accident, &#39;committing suicide&#39; that you didn&#39;t and there was foul play. Tell people.</p>

<p>The more you keep to yourself and the more you keep quiet the easier you will be to forget about. Make youtube videos. contact people, even if you don&#39;t &#39;join&#39; their network(I actually have no idea how it works), inform them of what&#39;s happening.</p>

<p>Contact news agencies. Independent news, all of them. Record who responds, report all of it, here and other places. You must be LOUD. Half the fight is already over if you have courage - these people who are doing this do not have courage, they need to stay in the dark and in the shadows because the light would reveal who they are.</p>

<p>Inform the police you are being harassed. Inform the FBI. Tell everybody.</p>

<p>I highly, highly recommend crafting your posts. As simplistic as it seems, people will regard fast typing and typos as a negative thing. It pays to think, speak and write like you have a brain. :)</p>

<p>By the same token if I thought people were following me I would film them and show other people to have them verify that what I observed appears accurate. </p>

<p>We assess reality not by what we think is true, but by what is independently verifiable for this exact reason.</p>

<p>Also intelligence has absolutely nothing to do with whether or not you are mentally ill. In fact often those at the highest levels of intelligence suffer from one mental illness or another. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s fair. The only reason I ask is because schizophrenic symptoms usually make their first appearance in that age range. And schizophrenics rarely think that they&#39;re ill. That&#39;s part of the problem with treating the disease in fact. They think everyone is out to get them. I&#39;m not saying this is happening to you for sure, but it&#39;s a possibility that you should consider because if it is the case it will be good to get help sooner rather than later.  </p>

I don’t think she gave another such update publicly and don’t recall her name unfortunately but Google search will reveal the interview. </p>

<p>She said Congress is well aware of the issue but none are willing to tangle with it for several reasons. Basis her description, gang-stalkers are comprised of like-minded individuals who are outsourced for jobs/targets and using high-tech equal or better than most PD’s. There is also a “religious component” to many cases but the Army officer was wary of getting involved in the matter. </p>

First, about Facebook. What happened most likely is that someone got angry and reported you. Sandy Hook is a very touchy subject. People on Facebook get snitched on all the time for not using their real names and Facebook requires them to show ID to continue to use their account. Maybe Facebook did it themselves because, despite all the nonsense people post on there they do claim to be against &quot;fake news.&quot;<br/>
The other things you talk about just don&#39;t seem logical. Like someone else said they can just give you a heart attack if they wanted to. You don&#39;t have access to any secret knowledge so it&#39;s not like they would want to investigate and track the source.<br/>
I think you are exhausted and you need a break. Try to get some rest and eat well. I do understand that what you&#39;re talking about is possible, but it just doesn&#39;t make sense that they would have a team of people stalking you. The cost would just be too much and there is no real reason for it. </p>
