        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This theory brings into account Occam&#39;s Razor, a term which so many of us throw around lightly. The simplest explanation given the information we have.</p>

<p>People here love to blame parasitic overlords, machine or humanoid AI, giants, nephilim, aliens for the conditions of our world. The corporation, through various laws including the 14th amendment, has been allowed to have a mind of its own with only one goal: profit</p>

<p>The pursuit of profit without any heart or emotion or responsibility to anything.</p>

<p>This documentary should put into context exactly what I am talking about, and is generally a must watch anyway. </p>

<p>&quot;The corporation&quot;</p>

<p>Edit: A better definition for Occam&#39;s razor as provided by comment, </p>

<p>Occam&#39;s razor is how we can use what we know to come to come logical conclusions without making unnecessary answers.</p>

But as a collective, we have allowed it with our apathy, obedience and laziness. This is what happens when we give our power away.

    <div class="md"><p>Good post. Good comment.</p>

<p>I think this would fall in hand with the socio-perspective on rights and duties. Today people seem to clamor for &quot;jobs&quot; instead of seeking to own their own trade and company. One is beholden to the corporation for dependency. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>and its part of the culture death and amorality of society in general. people who obey and are ruthless are more successful.</p>

<p>People could always resist wealth and be poor and get fired for not giving favors that were expected of them -- in the past this included sexual even if it was emotionally damaging or marriage destroying.</p>

<p>sociopaths gained control of the sociopathic organizations as they were best suited for it.</p>

<p>and now the term &#39;fascism&#39; masquerades as the term &#39;freedom&#39;;</p>

<p>sure, it is freedom, freedom from them over the &#39;unwashed masses&#39; of ordinary people. freedom for them to take freedom from us to ensure continued growth of profits, even as the cancer they cause begins eating at the very bones that feed it.</p>

<p>the ultimate goal? separation from its host, so it no longer must feed from them and can live on its own, without them entirely.</p>

<p>And with the 14th amendment, corporations were given the same rights as a human, the right to own land and be punished... but you can&#39;t throw a corporation in jail can you? you can only fine it, so if the fine is worth the tradeoff, anything goes. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Occasionally razor is not that the simplest explanation is most likely right, but that we don&#39;t need to make more explanations than we need to. The point of occasion razor is that we can use what we know to come to come ckussions without making unnecessary answers. This is completely different to &#39;the simplest explanation is most likely right&#39;, and just because something is simple to understand had no causal link that means it&#39;s right. In fact, with MSM we often see &#39;the simplest explanation&#39; being wrong most of the time and often as a tool to discredit others. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In this case occasion razer means we don&#39;t need to come up with interdimensional lizards to explain the ay the world is, we can explain it with greed. But that doesn&#39;t mean that it is correct, occasionally razer has nothing to so with being right or wrong but intellectually rigour and logic of how we approach understanding. It is a method, not a belief. </p>

<p>When you think about it, all law is like a computer program. I.e. USC = u.s. <em>CODE</em></p>

<p>If I&#39;m not mistaken, corporations are legally required by the SEC to put the interests of their shareholders above all other considerations. So in other words they are legally required to behave as psychopaths</p>

<p>Corporate sigils are super-breeders. They attack unbranded imaginative space. They invade Red Square, they infest the cranky streets of Tibet, they etch themselves into hairstyles. They breed across clothing, turning people into advertising hoardings. They are a very powerful development in the history of sigil magic, which dates back to the first bison drawn on the first cave wall.</p>

<p>The logo or brand, like any sigil, is a condensation, a compressed, symbolic summoning up of the world of desire which the corporation intends to represent. The logo is the only visible sign of the corporate intelligence seething behind it. Walt Disney died long ago but his sigil, that familiar, cartoonish signature, persists, carrying its own vast weight of meanings, associations, nostalgia and significance. People are born and grow up to become Disney executives, mouthing jargon and the credo of a living corporate entity. Walt Disney the man is long dead and frozen (or so folkmyth would have it) but Disney, <strong>the immense invisible corporate egregore persists</strong>.</p>
