And im not saying. &quot;Everyone has been waking up.&quot; But to see people coming forth and asking the right questions, coming to new conclusions and digging into the reality of the world... </p>

<p>It&#39;s reassuring.</p>

<p>Thank you guys. Keep up the good fight</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. The realization is tough - no matter how wild and inevitably true some things turn out to be, it will not change the world over-night. It will occur only through people being shown individual iterations of information and changing their foundations slowly. And what one person finds shocking, others dismiss. So, the only true edification we get is that the overall activity continues to trend towards outing the truth and reconsidering the history we thought we knew. I&#39;m thankful that some people are beginning to learn about the true backstory of the first 2 world wars, the assassination of JFK, etc. and also equally frustrated by how the world we live in allows for zero breaks in the machine&#39;s operation that might give people a true opportunity to reconstruct their situation without having to compromise their own well-being (and that of their family) </p>

<p>Happy to say I agree, maybe this was a silver-lining to that shit show of an election in 2016. I don&#39;t give a shit who anyone voted for or their opinions on Trump or HRC - what I mean is that with everything that happened, the way the whole thing went down, the confusion, the frustration (with either the outcome or the portrayal of any portion) made people finally say &quot;OK this is just a fucking mess; what has led us to this point?&quot; - maybe it makes them look at the voting system and Tweedism, maybe it makes them look at the political family history, or international banking, fractional reserve lending, whatever. The point is that along with massively increased disillusionment, we (can potentially) create massively more informed people (assuming the information is accurate and credible). If your ideal isn&#39;t what you thought it was, and you don&#39;t know what the actual ideal is, the next action is to start looking into the misrepresentations of your prior idealism. I&#39;m very thankful people are still willing to do this as we approach 2018 and not just immediately accept their reality and comforts while disregarding the disproportionate situations existing around them. </p>

<p>TL;DNR version: Yeah man. </p>

<p>But seriously, as much pessimism, extremism and blind loyalty as we see in the word, I still see hope, critical thought and the desire to do good in the world, and that gives me hope.</p>

<p>Sort by new and try to find some meaningful discussion. It works for now, but for how long, I don&#39;t know. This sub isn&#39;t heading in a good direction.</p>
