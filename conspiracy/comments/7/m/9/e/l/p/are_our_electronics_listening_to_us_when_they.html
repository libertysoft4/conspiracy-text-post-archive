        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This has happened a few times to me but I brushed it off. But this really got me thinking something is up.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago, I was on a flight and I just so happen to sit next to a pilot who was flying home. I asked him about what it takes to become a pilot and how he did it etc. </p>

<p>Just general small talk about his profession, it&#39;s not everyday you can talk to a pilot like that.</p>

<p>Anyway, I get off the plane and go to my destination. </p>

<p>A few hours later I&#39;m on Facebook and start seeing ads for flight lessons on my newsfeed. I know Facebook will look into your search history and will provide ads based on that. </p>

<p>I never looked up anything flight realited. I even went back in my search history to check. </p>

<p>This has happened before but with smaller things like vitimin water for example so I could easily brush it off as a coinsidence.</p>

<p>But this was a bit too specific. I&#39;ve talked about this to other people and they thought the same thing and said similar things happened to them with things that are a bit too specific.</p>

<p>What do you think guys? Has anyone noticed this too? I noticed it will also suggest things a little too well on Google search. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know mine does, but it&#39;s on, in sleep mode.  I was talking to my son about a new pizza place in town as we drove past, and next day, saw video ads for that place on Facebook.  Never searched for it.  Never saw ads before or since for it.  Also, I was talking to my wife and said something about &quot;he better learn how to drive that truck better&quot; or something like that, referring to her father and his new pickup.  The next day ALL my facebook ads were for truck driving schools.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The significance of your story is the location at which you mentioned the pizza place. I&#39;m pretty sure that the GPS tracker works in conjunction with the microphone for ad research somehow. I walked through a Home Depot not long ago and joked with my wife that I needed to get a tool belt for all the crap I&#39;d been buying for projects lately. Within about 8 hours I think I had ads for toolbelts on Facebook. I have other similar stories as well. It&#39;s way too common at this point to be coincidence. The question now is, are we as a society okay with this?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And you still have Facebook on your phone why?</p>

<p>I&#39;m not trying to poke you in the eye here.  Just frustrated that this is the third thread this week where folks have shared similar stories to yours and there&#39;s been zero level of pissed offedness about this.</p>

<p>I tried Facebook about 10 years ago and felt it was too invasive so deleted and didn&#39;t miss a thing.  Now I see all these anecdotes of spying and uber-targeted ads with no public outrage and calls for boycotts.  Why do we roll over and take this kind of crap?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Happened to me christmas eve. I was begging my boyfriend to take me to get a waffle for Christmas. Minutes later I received an ad on FB for something called &quot;Waffle Blocks&quot; (a kid&#39;s toy). I don&#39;t have kids so I don&#39;t have anything in my search history for toys. Nor did I search anything about waffles.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve had a similar thing happen with my amazon fire. </p>

<p>I have screenshots of these ads as evidence. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just shut off the mic setting (if possible) and unplug when not in use. I cannot actually prove that the advertisement happened because the fire was in my room. The device was the more expensive fire TV. (Not the TV Stick). It could have been a coincidence. 
 For the record I now use a fire TV stick and have not seen any correlations. </p>

<p>But I can say for certain that the FB/Waffle Block ad happened because my phone was near me.  It happened within minutes.</p>

<p>IMHO I seriously don&#39;t know how to feel. It feels like this has been part of my whole life. I don&#39;t have anything to hide. If somebody wants to sell me something I&#39;m going to use, whatever. At this point I&#39;m jaded and I don&#39;t care. It&#39;s not like I&#39;m trying to buy meth pipes or traffick small children, so I really don&#39;t give a fuck. What am I going to do? Give into worry and panic because I&#39;m always being watched? I would surely go crazy giving into that anxiety. &lt;/End rant&gt;</p>

My fear is that if there ever comes a time where freedoms are stripped away from us, and what your doing does become illegal one day... There&#39;s already going to be a file with all your personal information, all of your children&#39;s personal information, and everyone you communicate with. You won&#39;t have a choice in fighting for your rights and if you try they will know.

    <div class="md"><p>Well what is more of a concern are these health care insurance companies that offer incentives to use fitbit devices and upload your information. What if you have tachycardia or something? At what point will they use this information against you?</p>

<p>The way things are looking, healthcare isn&#39;t going to be safe. Health care rates are either going to hike up, or ya all won&#39;t be able to get health care at all. This favors the rich who can afford to focus on their nutrition and health by paying for gym memberships, and fresh food. Also the rich are able to have more PTO and free time during the day. (This isn&#39;t always the case but I wouldn&#39;t know bc I ain&#39;t rich)</p>

<p>This system would completely fuck the low/middle class American working 1 to 2 jobs AND/OR going to school AND/OR raising a child. When you have that much going on nutrition and exercise aren&#39;t your first priorities. (Not to mention the cheap S.A.D. food that is advertised to us daily)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have a firewall installed on my phone, so I can monitor the data traffic. It&#39;s impressive how often all these f****** apps by Google send data away to their servers. Like every 2 secs. </p>

<p>I disabled all these apps by Google (there is a long list of them), and now, I can let my phone on the table, come back after a day, and 1% of battery life only will be gone. </p>

<p>Before that, just leaving the phone on the table without even using it for a day, and like, 30% of the battery life would be gone. WITHOUT EVEN TOUCHING THE PHONE!!</p>

<p>The counterpart is that the phone is now difficult to use, because all these apps by google are connected to one another somehow. Like, you cannot open the play store if you have the google play music app disabled. </p>

<p>Google has basically designed android so that you cannot escape their surveillance of your activity.</p>

You can see how this is worth gold to the insurance company, and how the insurance company is then going to screw you. Same thing with personal finance related discussions.</p>

<p>Or, IDK, say you have an affair, and your tech devices at home (webcams you have on the smartphone, tablet, laptop, even TV now) record the audio (or even video without you knowing). They could keep a record for an indefinite period of time, and this could be used against you one way or another someday. </p>

I was talking to my brother yesterday morning about getting a x sport membership. Couple hours later I&#39;m on safari on my phone and was bombarded with xsport promos.  I&#39;m used to it by now. If I have conversations I put my phone in a different room. I was the crazy one in the family. Now everyone puts their phones away during dinner etc.</p>

<p>I bring this up in a Reddit post and people ask if I looked anything up while talking about it, which I did.  They were happy to dismiss it at that point because obviously they used the recent search history on my Verizon android phone to post a video that might interest him since he&#39;s obviously located right near me due to the GPS in his iPhone on an at&amp;t network.  They were cool with this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can definitely confirm this for myself now. I have been taking language classes in an attempt to learn Spanish. Ever since I&#39;ve started, I&#39;ve received nothing but Spanish advertisements for restaurants and services through Spotify. They&#39;ve also been coming through my computer, which is logged into the same spotify account. So I&#39;d consider Spotify as a service is compromised. </p>

<p>However, I spend very little time talking aloud outside of school, and if I do, my phone is in another room. As much of an invasion of privacy as this is, they&#39;re gleaning no useful information from me. They&#39;re only picking up the words of another person, the instructor in that class. And when I talk, I typically avoid discussing things like companies, restaurants, and services. There&#39;s bigger battles to face in regards to privacy, internet safety, and other things currently in my opinion. I&#39;d rather fight to end this than spend time worrying about it myself.

    <div class="md"><p>The former National Security Agency contractor who exposed U.S. government surveillance programs by disclosing classified material in 2013 has a new job: app developer.</p>

<p>Edward Snowden in a video message Friday unveiled a new phone app he helped create, called Haven, that aims to protect laptops from physical tampering.</p>

<p>Snowden says it&#39;s an open-source tool designed for human rights activists and other people at risk and it uses an Android phone&#39;s sensors to detect changes in a room.</p>

<p>The software was developed with the Freedom of Press Foundation and the Guardian Project. It has been greeted with mixed social media reactions, with some people celebrating its security capabilities and others saying they don&#39;t trust Snowden.</p>

<p>Snowden has lived in Russia since 2013, when the country gave him asylum, resisting U.S. pressure to extradite him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Re iPhones, if you have hands free Siri switched on, you are literally allowing Siri to listen to anything it can hear, analyse your words etc as it waits to hear your commands. 
I don’t know whether your voice is recorded as audio or as text-to-speech but I guarantee that data has got to bounce to an Apple server and be stored, even if only momentarily. I’d say each dataset would have some kind of identifier to prevent crossed streams of data (ie differentiating your “hey Siri” request from mine) and that must mean that it is also ‘read’ or analysed.
I’m sure in the not too distant future, when our ubiquitous phones and their recordings are accepted as monitoring devices, we may see things like preemptive law enforcement based on captured data from our phones, such as stoner conspiracy conversations on the couch. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have found this to be the case in many conversations that I have had. Earlier this year I broke up with someone. I didn’t post it on Facebook or anywhere else for that matter, just private discussions between the two of us. However, dating app ads started to appear on my Facebook timeline. I have found this to be the case when discussing purchases as well, I say something and an amazon ad appears. This does not apply to the word umbrella, I assume because of the song. </p>

<p>Also, I have a stalker that I am positive uses the camera and the mic on my phone to spy on me. Also, he has disabled the phone function so that I may not call anyone, and I cannot receive calls. When I get a call and answer it, it continues to make the ring tone while the screen appears to have answered the call. When I make a call there is no sound on either end. I have checked my settings, and everything is proper. Additionally, I do not always receive text messages, just the notification but when I go to see the text there isn’t one. He has also blocked my Facebook messenger app. I have an iPhone 7+. After the most recent update my phone returned to full functionality for approximately two hours. I have taken my phone to the Verizon store and it went to the boot screen and would not unlock, when I got home I was allowed the limited phone functions that I have back, which is the internet browser basically and texts he wants me to receive. My phone messages work fine, and I can replay and hear those, the phone also displays the phone message text fine. He often uses all my data within the first couple of days of the cycle rendering my phone useless for most of the month unless I have wi-fi. </p>

<p>If one obsessed guy can do that, what can the government do. </p>

<p>To him since he has a keystroke tracker as well: You’re a dick - Chris, and I’m sick of your shit. </p>

<p>But this was a bit too specific. I&#39;ve talked about this to other people and they thought the same thing and said similar things happened to them with things that are a bit too specific.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A similar story happened to me, about something very specific too. So, I got this friend outside who told me about a fruit I never ever heard about. It&#39;s called &quot;finger lime&quot;, and it is a native fruit of Australia. I think pretty much only Australia grows it, and Australia doesn&#39;t grow much of it anyway. </p>

<p>So, this friend gave me a few to bring home, and back home, I go to the kitchen and tell my wife &quot;hey, today I was introduced to a fruit I never heard about before. It does taste good. Try it. It&#39;s called finger lime&quot;.</p>

<p>So she tries and all, and like, 10 minutes later, she moves on to another activity, she goes and grab the ipad, which was in the bedroom, charging. The ipad was in plane mode, and the bedroom door was shut. She opens the gumtree app (a marketplace to exchange 2nd hand stuff) to browse new ads, and first thing that shows in big when she open the app : a paid advertisement for finger limes.</p>

<p>We both bugged for a minute. There is absolutely no way such a coincidence is possible. As I said, I never ever heard about that fruit before that day, so obviously, I never searched for it on the Internet before. Plus she never browse those health/nutrition content websites on her ipad. So, there is no way she recently stumbled upon an article talking about the health benefits of finger lime or something like that. Plus, we are not talking about apples, or oranges here. We are talking about a fruit that is grown in Australia only, in small quantities, and during a relatively short season.</p>
