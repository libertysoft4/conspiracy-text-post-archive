<p>The technology to see through the eyes of a cat was public in 99. They say tech behind the scenes is 50 years ahead, and technological improvements scale exponentially. </p>

<p>Speculation:
Currently, technology exists to decode not only vision but hearing, thoughts and visualizations as well. This can be performed wirelessly. Input is also possible, meaning thoughts, visualizations, sounds and sights can be wirelessly inserted into a subject. </p>

<p>This technology is known and utilized by all major governments and NGO&#39;s. The implications of the existence of such a technology are overwhelming. This is the brave new world.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I find the suggestion at the end even more impressive. It would appear as though the cat perceives the human&#39;s face as cat-like. If true (proven perhaps by doing the same experiments with dogs) perhaps this the animal-version of anthropomorphization. </p>

<p>Establishing clearer images of this supposed phenomenon could shine a light on all kinds of questions about the nature of consciousness. Incredible stuff.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is where hallucinogens or sleep deprivation can funk with that process. </p>

<p>I experienced a miss communication with my brain after pulling an all nighter and being 24 hours sleep deprived. While the body felt awake enough to function off of adrenaline, my reaction time and cognitive ability was reduced to a point I almost ran a red light because I kept thinking in my head when the city replaced the red light bulbs with those bouncy red kickballs. </p>

<p>My mind said red, said round, just couldn&#39;t make the connection to a traffic light or what to do at one.</p>

<p>This is certainly next generation creation of an entire platform of biomechanical systems. Consider a future based system where your AI assistant is your cat. Using this on humans is fraught with complications. Technologies like these are Pandoras boxes. When you open enough you start using the contents the boxes the magnitudes of potential for service to others, service to self, and service to the creator/destroyer become evident.

The knowledge of that presents a wider array of potential if you are already in that state when presented with those who are induced. The subtle difference is the act of free will on this journey.

</blockquote>

<p>In the paper you linked, this concept of depersonalization seems to be linked with anxiety, depression, and trauma. Is it a desirable outcome? Why would anyone seek it out deliberately? It seems like a complex way of describing emotional numbness that results from bad experiences or physiological inclination to depression. I watched some of the YouTube videos, they are a bit tough to follow without any context. It isn&#39;t exactly clear in the doc or these videos whether or not &#39;depersonalization&#39; is a good thing, you&#39;re associating it with some form of enlightenment?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The context is changing that response by intervening.  take for example helping a person who has recently been technologically augmented deal with whatever emotions come from that. It&#39;s uses are so vast just in terms of memory in dealing with these traumas. Depersonalization is not either good or bad. It just is.  It&#39;s a way trauma can be dealt with. It is also how so called enlightenment can be explored. It depends on what you are depersonalizing. At least that&#39;s how I&#39;m thinking now. I have to read a lot more around this. If I can find time. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think I get what you&#39;re saying. It&#39;s basically a way to shift perspective, and also an important field of research to consider with trends like transhumanism emerging, there are outcomes that need to be predicted and addressed before people start accepting microchip implants or things like the <a href="https://www.wired.com/2017/03/elon-musks-neural-lace-really-look-like/">neural lace</a>. It reminds me of the <a href="https://youtu.be/WX6uhU0OX_c">scene in Ghost in the Shell</a>
where they have to deal with a brain-hack victim responding to the reality that all of his family memories are false. It would be best to get ahead of these types of problems and understand how technology affects consciousness, but like you said a lot of the research happens in the dark. At the consumer/citizen end we are getting a comically naive presentation of these technologies, like that business in Texas pitching their offer to microchip employees alongside a <a href="https://www.nbcdfw.com/news/weird/Employees-Get-Microchipped-for-Work-437891963.html">&#39;chips and salsa&#39; party.</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know the question wasn&#39;t directed at me, however I&#39;ll try to answer. Depersonalization would be considered negative when experienced involuntarily, however has utility (such as the management of pain) and so may be desirable to experience voluntarily. </p>

<p>The definition of depersonalization doesn&#39;t seem consistent. It can mean something similar to dysmorphia, eg looking in the mirror and not perceiving the reflection to be yourself. The definition closest to enlightenment would be similar to out of body experiences and ego death, a state of existing solely as consciousness,  free from a body. This is the state sought in transcendental meditation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the response, it makes a bit more sense now. The name &#39;Depersonalization&#39; seems similar to Dissassiociation, which appears to be the desired outcome of fear and trauma based research programs like MKultra, that&#39;s why I was skeptical of it being a desired outcome. The comparison to Transcendental Meditation makes sense though as far as being something worth pursuing, is the implication of the research being done that there&#39;s a possibility to simply implant a device that causes depersonalization to occur? If so, that seems like it would be a huge system-shock, Oliver Sacks had a variation of dysmorphia, but he was highly functional, its hard to imagine that total depersonalization would be anything but devastating, it&#39;s one thing to not be able to recognize faces, but how could a person live in a world without an identity? That seems like an automaton.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This may be simplifying it, but depersonalization is conscious disassociation.  Disassociation involves no presence of mind. A period of disassociation will yield no memories. Whereas a period of  depersonalization can be remembered and consciously affected.    </p>

<p>e:The ability to trigger depersonalization (depending on the definition, im using out of body or conscious disassociation) would be quite special. This is the state sought to be attained through transcendental meditation, and said to be the key to unlocking a humans true potential. The possibility that such a technology exists, and is possessed by the powerful of the world also has great implications. Those sitting atop the pyramidal structure of society posses power beyond imagine, very intriguing to think about.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Depersonalisation or disassociation as it is usually meant is the exact opposite of TM&#39;s effects.</p>

<p>The deepest point of TM — <em>samadhi</em> — is described thusly: &quot;<em>The state of Being is one of pure consciousness, completely out of the ﬁeld of relativity; there is no world of the senses or of objects, no trace of sensory activity, no trace of mental activity. There is no trinity of thinker, thinking process and thought; doer, process of doing and action; experiencer, process of experiencing and object of experience. The state of transcendental Unity of life, or pure consciousness, is completely free from all trace of duality.</em>&quot;</p>

<p>.</p>

<p>Certainly &quot;out of body&quot; is the antithesis of this state as it is the ultimate state of <em>Yoga</em> — <em>union</em> of mind, body and spirit.</p>

<p>Well, technically there is no &quot;desired state&quot; during TM as any kind of goal will detract from effortless practice. TM is done for changes found outside of meditation.</p>

<p>Long-term TM practice results in a situation where a &quot;pure&quot; sense-of-self — a sense of &quot;<strong>I am</strong>&quot; not associated with perceptual or intellectual or emotional &quot;stuff&quot; — starts to emerge and eventually becomes permanent: <strong>I am</strong> is present at all times, whether one is awake, dreaming or even in deep sleep.</p>

<p>Long, long term (16,000 hours practice, on average) TMers who reported having such a pure sense-of-self 24/7 continuously for at least one year were asked to &quot;describe yourself&quot; and these were some of their responses:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>We ordinarily think my self as this age; this color of hair; these hobbies . . . my experience is that my Self is a lot larger than that. It&#39;s immeasurably vast. . . on a physical level. It is not just restricted to this physical environment</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>It&#39;s the ‘‘I am-ness.’’ It&#39;s my Being. There&#39;s just a channel underneath that&#39;s just underlying everything. It&#39;s my essence there and it just doesn&#39;t stop where I stop. . . by ‘‘I,’’ I mean this 5 ft. 2 person that moves around here and there</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>I look out and see this beautiful divine Intelligence. . . you could say in the sky, in the tree, but really being expressed through these things. . . and these are my Self</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>I experience myself as being without edges or content. . . beyond the universe. . . all-pervading, and being absolutely thrilled, absolutely delighted with every motion that my body makes. With everything that my eyes see, my ears hear, my nose smells. There&#39;s a delight in the sense that I am able to penetrate that. My consciousness, my intelligence pervades everything I see, feel and think</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>When I say ’’I’’ that&#39;s the Self. There&#39;s a quality that is so pervasive about the Self that I&#39;m quite sure that the ‘‘I’’ is the same ‘‘I’’ as everyone else&#39;s ‘‘I.’’ Not in terms of what follows right after. I am tall, I am short, I am fat, I am this, I am that. But the ‘‘I’’ part. The ‘‘I am’’ part is the same ‘‘I am’’ for you and me</em></p></li>
</ul>

<p>.</p>

<p>The above descriptions apply during &quot;witnessing dreaming&quot; (not to be confused with <em>lucid</em> dreaming). &quot;Witnessing sleep&quot; is can be described thusly: </p>

<p><a href="http://cyber.sci-hub.tw/MTAuMTExMS9ueWFzLjEyMzE2/10.1111%40nyas.12316.pdf"><em>. . . there’s a continuum there. It’s not like I go away and come back. It’s a subtle thing. It’s not like I’m awake waiting for the body to wake- up or whatever. It’s me there. I don’t feel like I’m lost in the experience. That’s what I mean by a continuum. You know it’s like the fizzing on top of a soda when you’ve poured it. It’s there and becomes active so there’s something to identify with. When I’m sleeping, it’s like the fizzing goes down.</em></a></p>

<p>If you&#39;re interested, there&#39;s a set of studies published by <em>samadhi</em>, enlightenment, etc., that I put up <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/transcendental/comments/7djr03/a_bunch_of_research_on_tm_pure_consciousness_and/">here.</a> You need to enter a &quot;CAPTCHA&quot; phrase to get past their anti-bot security on the study-links.

    <div class="md"><p>Very insightful, thanks again. I remember reading a theory about the benefits of this continued state of consciousness; it proposed that after death you could retain consciousness, rather than entering a vague unconscious state where your soul could become lost and misguided. Similar to how sometimes we fall asleep and act strangely in our dreams with no memory of waking life; compared to (as described in your post) retaining memory and consciousness. </p>

<p>It&#39;s an interesting theory. I&#39;d be very interested in whether these people are able to be hypnotized, or fall into a trance. Id assume not due to their persistent consciousness, how ever they may be able to relax and allow it.   </p>
