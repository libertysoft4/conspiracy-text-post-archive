<p>The list goes on. Yournewswire only exists for one reason: Money. </p>

<p>Every time someone posts a link to that repugnant website, they make money. They make an unimaginable amount of money every day. It&#39;s truly astounding just how much they&#39;re taking advantage of us.</p>

<p>People of r/conspiracy, this would truly be a great first step in cleaning up this subreddit. Look at the state of this place. Half the people only post here so they can get clicks on their crappy clickbait websites and Youtube videos. Let&#39;s clean this place up. This is not an act of censorship. They had this coming. No more yournewswire, your time is up.</p>

<p>We can really make this happen. If you disagree with the ban, give your reason(s) why in the comments. </p>

<p>BAN YOURNEWSWIRE</p>

<p><strong>Edit [3:03PM]</strong> - How does the community/mods feel about an Archive.is requirements for sites such as Yournewswire and Neonnettle; the same action used against CNN 5 months ago. Reasonable? No harm done, except to the owners of these clickbait sites.</p>

I would be all for banning them completely from the sub if I thought there would be no slippery slope. Convince me.

<p>What is an &quot;unimaginable amount of money?&quot; A million dollars a day? Couldn&#39;t they provide a source? Why leave it out? If there&#39;s no source, then this post is fake news. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They had her pics linked directly from the dentist&#39;s website. Same lady. She has the connection to the president. That&#39;s confirmed. </p>

<p>The dentist was a navy guy. Confirmed that he is the go-to dentist for the president, when the president is in the area. They have military dentist&#39;s in each region on standby for this. </p>

<p>Linked to news showing Obama went in for tooth work there at the right time.</p>

<p>The lady went to the white House and tried to breach it for unknown reasons. Dental assistant just flips one day and tried to contact Obama forcefully and brings her kid with her?</p>

<p>There was some analysis of the car chase, shooting, that argued that they wanted to kill her and couldve handled it differently. This is not too convincing, ymmv.</p>

<p>The day she did it was significant but I can&#39;t remember why sorry.</p>

<p>Kid was taken from her. Linked to news interviews of her family wanting to know why they are not being given the kid. This is very very odd. Kid should obviously have been given to gmother or sister within days. There&#39;s no explanation for this that makes sense. Kid fell into a gov. Black hole.</p>

<p>She told someone that the baby&#39;s daddy was a vip i think. (,I haven&#39;t read the article in years, not sure of every detail sorry. I&#39;ll find a link and post it in edit )</p>

<p>The whole timeline fits. (meet at dental visit, sex, 9 months for baby, etc.)</p>

<p>If sorchas source really is FSB. I&#39;d imagine they&#39;d be watching Obama, maybe caught him in a secret tryst, maybe one if thier spies heard Washington whispers about it. And they fed it to sorcha.</p>

<p>Why do you think it was 100% fabricated? How would you explain her behavior? How did sorcha put it all together if it was fiction? It seems like that would be a hard fit to come in with a story that matches reality like this. Like, why did she do it? Why won&#39;t they give up the kid? Lucky for sorcha that he uncovered the Navy dentist isn&#39;t it? Is it odd that she worked on the president, then later tries to the point of dying to get into the white house like a psycho with something to prove? </p>

<p>Then again, maybe Obama&#39;s CIA handlers made this up to perpetuate the cover story that Obama is straight!</p>

<p>If not, make some sense of it without it. Give me another explanation. You can&#39;t. The idea that she had his love child explains everyone&#39;s behavior, and the &#39;coincidental&#39; events as well, such as the lawyers arrest and the custody of the baby issue.</p>

<p>What would it take to establish that? It would have to be a DNA test. Well, family is now asking for one. In absence of that, all we have is circumstantial evidence. But it&#39;s an awful lot we have to go on.</p>

<p>Why did she say to police she was being followed by intelligence agents? Why did she later say it was at the behest of Obama? Why did she get in the car chase that ended her life? She was just crazy? All her supposedly irrational behavior makes perfect sense if you just believe her. When someone is accused of crazy irrational behavior, but then you are given a key to the lock so to speak, that crucial single bit of info, and it ties all the crazy behavior together so that it makes sense and is reasonable and rational after all, doesn&#39;t that make you consider that that info could be true?</p>

<p>The CIA agent (ever heard of a &quot;handler&quot;?) with a front company, that&#39;s only business was throwing Obama an inauguration party, with her name in this email account directory.  The agent slanders her in the media, ruing her credibility. He is inexplicably given the child, instead of the mother or sister. That didn&#39;t phase you?</p>

<p>Obama did go to her office, where she was a dental assistant. She is pictured in thier website. Her meeting Obama isn&#39;t outside the realm of possibility. Neither is the concept of a powerful man having a love child and covering it up. Obama already had that other babe they sent to an island so she wouldn&#39;t talk during the election. Anyway, the idea of the lady flipping out and showing up at baby&#39;s daddy&#39;s work to start drama isnt unusual either. Mistresses and side-hos do that regularly (I should know hehe,) None of this is unbelievable. When the family played along with the whole crazy lady narrative, things were fine. When they started demanding the kid, played hardball and had thier lawyer start talking real shit, he was promptly arrested. Could be unrelated, but in the context of CIA shenanigans, and the love child theory, your telling me that didn&#39;t raise your eyebrow? What the hell would then? It rarely gets this juicy.</p>

<p>There&#39;s more and more but I&#39;ll stop here.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what to tell you. It&#39;s an extremely solid story, as far as conspiracy theories go. It warrants further investigation by mainstream journalists, with all thier resources. </p>

<p>I wonder what you could possibly believe on this forum, as nothing posted here ever has this much meat on the bone.</p>

<p>Right, and it&#39;s completely unsubstantiated.  The timing of it, as presented by Faal anyway, is either coincidence, or completely fabricated, as are the rest of the stories from that source.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve looked at the article you cite.  There is a LOT of information there that you&#39;ll just have to take their word for.  No citing, no explanation of sources, and a presented timeline that has no other bearing on reality other than &#39;Sorcha says so&#39;.</p>

<p>Look, it&#39;s a great story.  It&#39;s almost Dan Brown-level creative.  But unsubstantiated is unsubstantiated, especially from a notoriously bad source.  All of this stuff, the &#39;handler&#39;, the company, etc., is combined to push a single narrative that all relies on information impossible to prove, and ambiguous enough to disprove.  This is how people get so badly duped.</p>

<p>You&#39;re free to believe what you&#39;d like, but if I were you I&#39;d spend some time trying to verify where Faal got the information.  If you can&#39;t do it, chances are it&#39;s all crap, like every other story from the source.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely, but if you notice the &quot;leaders&quot; are pretty relaxed with their life and are the &quot;newcomers&quot; that have this revengey feeling in regard.
Feeding them some hate is a way to regain mindset after a too soft lifestart many of recent generations had, along the dependency from having women around.
As i usually look with sociologic perspective i think it&#39;s a good thing to happen. Both men and women have deteriorated and it&#39;s a game of mirrors.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>George Soros made his money as a currency trader. He is famously known as “the man who Broke the Bank of England” as he shorted pounds way back in 1992 when it was clear the UK government could not keep the UK in the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM). The ERM, in simple terms, sought to ease trade between then common market (present day EU) members with their own currencies. Central banks would manipulate interest rates to keep the value of a currency within a certain buffer relative to the then-king, the Deutsche Mark (DM). The treasury would be required to adjust interest rates and/or purchase pounds for the agreed rate so that the fixed exchange rate can stay in place.</p>

<p>George looked at the market fundamentals of the UK and realized, quite sensibily, that the UK was not Germany. As such, the idea that the UK could shadow German interest rate policy and aim for German-style low inflation was absurd. He bet that the Bank of England would blink first and stop supporting the artificially high price of the pound rather than waste away the country’s treasury. He turned out to be correct in the end and made billions as a result. </p>

<p>His “job” (if you can call a non-productive activity like that a job in the first place) is to make money. If the poor decicions of the political decision makers are what led him make that money it says far more about who is controlling the show than it does about someone who saw an in and took it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree, that kind of &quot;job&quot; is a product of the times and of bad regulations, and can be useful to spot said regulations. For that alone he is like many people. But few of this people go ahead and use the problem-reaction-solution paradigm to enforce the kind of situation they can profit from - so things as lobbyism, arming of rebels, voicing - and to say it a la Chomsky - and actually manifacturing dissent.
While on Hillary it&#39;s easy to go hard - she flaunts her evil - Soros i can only lay out the level of implied bad regulations inside the system necessary for this man to run his business like he does.
But i would point to Soros and the controller both being part of a bigger traffic scheme.
We the people don&#39;t control the politics, so those &quot;controllers&quot; are more of maddened empowered particles with a lot of business potential and usually the will to capitalize on that.</p>

<p>You can’t cry censorship because someone shuts you up for talking shit and slandering someone’s name. At some point enough is enough and these sites should be disciplined for creating stories out of thin air for money.</p>

<p>Then when the mods don&#39;t ban x websites, the community gets into a big stink about it. The community divides into those that do and do not want a website banned. Shills could spam to get a website they don&#39;t like banned.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a rule coming into effect requiring each submission to have a comment explaining why it sad submitted. At least try this first and use the up vote and down vote buttons before starting to ban. </p>

<p>Do you have one reason why you don&#39;t support an archive.is rule for Yournewswire?
What&#39;s the harm in that? The site only exists to make money off of gullible people. They have no journalistic integrity. They are literally disinformation. An archive requirement would lower the amount of spambots posting links to this subreddit. No?</p>

<p>So how do some slip through? Could it be because these sites are designed to give the appearance of a factual news website, while making money off us at the same time?</p>

<p>Wouldn&#39;t banning the website cut down on spam all together? Seems like it would eliminate the problem from the get-go. </p>

<p>A lot of you are not understanding the gravity of the Information War.  There is a huge battle for hearts and minds raging everywhere, on every site, all over the fucking internet right now.  From social media, to Alex Jones.  From ShareBlue to [Insert Right-Wing Digital Team Here].</p>

<p>Both sides are spinning stories.  Both sides are flat out lying.  It&#39;s not just left, right, fake news in one spot.  There is &quot;fake news&quot; everywhere from both sides.  In the conspiracy world it is up to the reader to be informed, and to be able to put aside their partisan feelings and say &quot;I think this article is bullshit.&quot;  I&#39;ve done it on several occasions with right-wing articles.  I&#39;ve done it a multitude of times with mainstream articles.  The truth often falls in the middle somewhere.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for sharing this, I was actually looking to cite this.</p>

<p>I honestly don&#39;t even agree with the mods decision here, but I understand why they did it, especially given the Wikileaks revelations of collusion between campaign(s) and mass media.  I really think that any source should be allowed and it&#39;s up to the community, as a whole, to engage positively or negatively.</p>

<p>Obviously that&#39;s difficult, especially when the easiest website to write bots for is the facilitator of the discussion.</p>

<p>However, yes I agree with you.  Archive.is links to circumvent ad revenue and click-thrus is ideal for these websites, and that&#39;d be the most ideal solution.  It&#39;d probably help curtail the various bots that post link throughs to these sites.  I wasn&#39;t trying to come off as an asshat, more of a devil&#39;s advocate to argue against censorship.</p>

<p>Where have I seen this before?? Oh, yeah, this is the exact play of google/fb/twitter/msm to call others fake news and censor their competition and/or anything tptb don&#39;t want us to read/watch. Not surprised I&#39;m seeing cries to censor the opposition being pushed here too by people w/the same exact agenda as tptb&#39;s state-run media that is actively doxxing, crushing and censoring those w/opinions outside the mainstream they don&#39;t like.</p>

<p>If shills get their way, all &quot;fringe,&quot; according the gatekeeper&#39;s definition, conspiracy sites will be banned and only MSM will be allowed and pushed, just like irl. What an ideal new r/politics this will be. I can&#39;t wait! /s</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess the real question is who would it harm more?  </p>

<p>The traffic of small, dedicated websites that research evidence-based conspiracies.  Some of these websites depend on the traffic in order to continue investigating these theories.</p>

<p>or,</p>

<p>The traffic of large mainstream media sites that do not specialize in conspiracies</p>

<p>It may seem like having a default archive link has no unintended consequences, but there probably will be harm.  It hurts the small budget researchers much more than multi-billion dollar corporations.  </p>

<p>For me, I think it is easier to downvote the conspiracies that have zero evidence, or crappy sources.  You also have the option to not even click on the post after you see the source.  </p>

<p>I do think your post is important.  It  increases the awareness of propaganda, and it helps users differentiate credible theories from shit posts. </p>

You should not be writing a thesis on anything posted in r/conspiracy so when somebody posts something from a less-than-reputable site you have the option of disregarding it and allowing others to enjoy the buzz. You want to dictate what other people can share because you don&#39;t find it credible?! Hello...we&#39;re discussing conspiracy theories!</p>

<p>Brush off what you don&#39;t like and let us have it. If you find r/conspiracyFacts too boring you can spruce it up by adding some verified news reports from credible sources.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just because somebody posts something it doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re gullible. I see r/conspiracy (actually, Reddit in general) as a bunch of people sitting around a bar going &quot;Hey! Did you guys hear about George Soros?&quot; then conversation stems from that. I don&#39;t necessarily believe it but that&#39;s why I say it. To see if anybody else knows anything to either prove or disprove it or to steer the conversation into something else interesting. In real life somebody would call bullshit and they would stay out of the conversation thinking everybody else was foolish. Can you imagine if that person appealed to authority to ban the conversation altogether? That&#39;s what you&#39;re trying to do. </p>

<p>When I first read the article I wasn&#39;t sure if I believed it or not but after reading some comments I&#39;m convinced it&#39;s BS. Thankfully r/conspiracy allowed that exchange to happen. (I also saw a big hole in the story that nobody else has mentioned yet.)</p>

<p>Read the posts you agree with, ignore or downvote the ones you don&#39;t. But why try to take things away from other users? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>actually, I retract my earlier statement, because I realized that the mods aren’t actually censoring CNN. Articles from CNN are still allowed through archive.is. R/conspiracy is merely banning direct links to CNN, reducing the amount of revenue for CNN even just a little as a form of protest against the doxxing incident. The sub still allows CNN content, so it isn’t really censorship. In that case, there’s no comparison between banning CNN for doxxing and censoring a different website for fake news.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You realize that massive amounts of botting happens site wide on Reddit especially in regards to anything negative about a certain political party right? The amount of news articles I&#39;ve seen reach front page that have been retracted or proven incorrect is laughable. Yet here we are saying ban an already laughable sub because they posted 1 fake article about the beloved political party puppet master Soros. And the one person that actually had a logical response</p>

<blockquote>
<p>so call them out as fake news and downvote? I dont get your concern....</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Got 600+ downvotes. If you want see the propaganda and manipulation from both sides I don&#39;t know what else to say.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I talking about it in several other comment chains, but I think that doxxing is only ok if the anonymous poster alludes to illegal activity, eg being a mod of r/jailbait. But people shouldn&#39;t be afraid to post political views and opinions for fear of being exposed. Sure, some liberals might think that the user CNN doxxed was a racist POS, but I&#39;m sure some T_D users think pretty badly of those liberals, and wouldn&#39;t be afraid to tear those liberals apart if they were doxxed.</p>

That attracted the attention of a CNN journalist who decided to do some research on the person that posted it, which lead him to reddit.  From there it was very easy to find out who <a href="/u/HanAssholeSolo">/u/HanAssholeSolo</a> was as the guy doxxed himself.  Anyone that knew about google.com could have found him. </p>

<p>So while writing about <a href="/u/HanAssholeSolo">/u/HanAssholeSolo</a>, that CNN journalist looked at his very public reddit comments and found that this guy had horrific comments about black people and genocide, wanting to kill people, racist comments, bad stuff about Jewish people, and the works.  The guy also happened to be a Trump supporter, but the article wasn&#39;t about his &quot;political&quot; views unless you consider the above political.</p>

<p>Now this may be a meta theory but maybe the mods are making money from that site. They are saying to downvote instead of personally policing because even a topic that gets a downvote after your investigation still drives some traffic from your investigation.</p>

<p>Additionally, and I know you&#39;re not asserting to the contrary, but I want to state that the U.S. practices socialism in a variety of ways that the average American utilizes everyday. The military, for example, is one of the largest examples. The public roads we use, the infrastructure, public transportation. All of these are inherently socialist by design.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Out of curiosity I read the 2016 compass. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Trump supported a decent minimum wage from the start, wants free education in state universities, has supported universal health care, consistently opposed the Transpacific Partnership Agreement and wants more bank regulation. Considering the cosy relationship that the Clintons and Trump have enjoyed until almost yesterday (reflected by Trump’s generous support for both Hillary’s senatorial campaigns and the Clinton Foundation) the mercurial Donald&#39;s differences may be less than they presently appear. Is it beyond all possibility that a Trump &#39;bi-partisan&#39; presidency might include a role for his old friend Hillary?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There&#39;s about 2 consistently truthful things in that paragraph. The rest is a mix of hope and delusion. Political compass consistently labels Stein as a centrist though. I imagine most Stein supporters would find that bizarre.</p>

<p>The answer is Cambridge Analytica, they have a search algorithm that is able to categories personality traits and political beliefs using a database with info on almost every adult American filled with data from their social media activities. They worked out conspiracy theorists are easy to manipulate when you push the right buttons for an individual, their algorithm automatically found them and worked out their buttons and sent them fake news stories that confirmed their conspiracy beliefs and were also pro-trump, anti-Hillary. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Totally agree. I would go as far as to say there never has really been any room in American politics for a true Left. The Centrists are painted as batshit liberal hippies so that the conversation never actually moves left of that position because that is just &quot;unrealistic&quot; or &quot;a pipe dream&quot;. What happened with Bernie is the perfect example of this. </p>

<p>America is a war machine after all, hard to continue to sell a shit ton of weapons if there is no one fighting. The thing that really sucks about this is that the propaganda has been doled out for so long that now a slip into far right fascism seems normal for some. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course not. u/AwJebus and u/AssuredlyAThrowAway never read the actual story regarding CNN and the neo-Nazi memer, they just bought into the t_D narrative.</p>

<p>Every time something is shared by POTUS people want to know what and who was behind it. In this case, CNN found out and also found that the guy had a history of extolling the virtues of murdering minorities and the homeless. So the guy apologized preemptively out of embarrassment and thus CNN decided for leniency whereas normally everything available would have been reported. The problem was that CNN phrased it as &quot;don&#39;t fall back into old ways or we won&#39;t be so kind next time&quot; and people flipped shit to defend a literal Nazi.</p>

<p>Fucking disgrace. You heard me u/AssuredlyAThrowAway. You&#39;re a huge part of the reason this sub is a toxic off-shoot of t_D. You don&#39;t even educate yourself on the actual conspiracy at play when it goes against your narratives.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>HAHA thats hilarious, posts on T_D get 60% of every vote counted towards them. literally mitigated so that every upvote gets a little more than half a point. that way its too hard to tell if your upvotes are not being counted since the % rounds to the nearest whole #. </p>

<p>You honestly think that every sub who posted during the NN thing didnt have bots? or a manipulated algorithm i garuntee you it did. and tons of the users just went along with it and upvoted everything or downvoted everything to remove the nonsense off of their /all, yet there was almost no posts other than those related to NN despite plenty posts being above the threshhold of upvotes needed to make /all</p>

<p>or when every post was about a senators vote for a day. that nonsense was definitely manipulated.</p>

<p>if anything T_D is being unfairly squelched by the top of Reddit. the only reason they have not to ban the sub is to keep them in the corner with their subs votes mitigated. thats why their crossposts do so well, because their votes actually get full credit.</p>

<p>Hell there are even lists of people who belong to T_D and rated based on their upvotes in the sub. honestly its completely insane how much T_D is censored. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>i will say, it seems that i have full credit for my posts as of right now. but during the time when i was getting upvotes it seemed as though i wasnt getting full credit.</p>

<p>everything i post seems to be controversial to some degree so its possible that i was getting influx of downvotes and upvotes simutaneously, but it is also possible that the algorithm was temporarily set that way and then changed back once someone brought it to light.</p>

<p>The % i got at the time was based on the math i did during my posts credit i was getting vs the amount of upvotes i got.</p>

<p>&quot;it would seem that at 296 upvotes, i have 228 Post karma - 59 base post karma. so this post has given me 169 post karma</p>

<p>296 maths 169 which is roughly 60% of the credit&quot;</p>

<p>that is how i came to that conclusion. perhaps it takes a few days for my account info to catch up to the data on the actual post or something since has been changed. either way it resolved itself when i wasnt looking.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>God damn, Ive stated this in many threads in this sub but never have I been downvoted this much. There has to be some sort of brigading going in. Because ussually this sub is something like 40/60 pro trump anti trump. Which is enough to get plenty of posts to the front page of the sub even if it&#39;s nowhere close to the reddit front page. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>How the fuck do you not get it?</p>

<p>The Donald is NOT popular. You&#39;re under the illusion that when you post there, your posts are voted up by like minded folks.</p>

<p>When you visit ANY other subreddit, those posts don&#39;t get voted up by bots, and actual people bury your shit ideas.</p>

<p>If there were actually a bunch of people upvoting TD posts and comments, you comment wouldn&#39;t be downvoted to Oblivion, because other real people would obviously back up your point if those same real people actually voted.</p>

<p>Fuck man, this is a simple concept. Please, try to grasp it.</p>

<p>That being said, you are correct that TD and their trash-posting get lots of assistance from bots.

Trump isn&#39;t in charge regardless of that or congress. Congress is 51 seat majority I&#39;m senate. Many many things can not be passed because 60 votes are required, and even with the 51 seats, it takes only 1 or 2 of the more liberal Republicans to not want it for the bill to go down. </p>

<p>Your bias proves you are unable to discuss this point intellectually, because you&#39;ve proven you can&#39;t examine this point intellectually. Balance is not a requirement of the court, your opinion on the beliefs of each member is clearly uninformed and unresearched, and you failed to address the point that this seat was considered valuable to maintain control of the court, and it did just that.youre just attempting and failing to move the goalposts into a discussion around balance and potential swing votes in the court. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>The only person living in a bubble, unironically in a thread where they are adamantly defending the necessity of their own bubble&#39;s existence, is you.</p>

<p>As defined by you, therefore also not applicable per your first rule that they cannot have bias. You instead meant to say they can only have YOUR bias, which is why no one particularly cares about your opinion, it can be easily dismissed as partisan garbage. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Is there any evidence to believe they are bots?  This is a very irrational and convenient way of thinking.  If t_D does something bad and upvote doxxing then they must be bots, even though you have 0 evidence for this.  In reality it&#39;s upvoted and there are several comments obviously not from bots in support of it.  But it&#39;s amazing seeing you try to rationalize this.  </p>

But if you can’t see that CNN and Fox News are two sides of the same coin you’re pretty dense.

Fox News on the other hand... I don’t see any effort. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s not how reddit is set up at all though.  It was designed from the beginning to be fairly hands-off.  The idea is that if mods are really running something to the ground, then we can just start a competing sub and the &#39;free-market&#39; of reddit users will migrate to whichever one is better.  It has happened numerous times in reddit&#39;s history.  r/trees is one of the more famous early examples.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>r/trees was the migration.  The original was r/marijuana.  Way back when, there were just two mods and they implemented some heavy-handed rules on what was and wasn&#39;t okay to talk about.  In the uproar that followed, one of the mods quit and the one that remained turned the assholery up to 11, banning people left and right.  It also came to light that he was a racist douche.  So everyone up and left and formed r/trees as an alternate, which thrived.  Later on, someone wanted to make a tree-oriented subreddit but r/trees was taken so they formed r/marijuanaenthusiasts as a joke.  </p>

<p>r/marijuana today is run by a completely different team and seems like a thriving enough subreddit, but r/trees is the main pot subreddit that everyone knows.  </p>

<p>Consider &quot;hate groups&quot;. Rather than banning their speech, we all benefit from letting them freely spew their filth, so it can be rationally addressed and then eventually die under the weight of its own fallacy.</p>

<p>While I understand the overt sensibility of your plea, I must say that censorship has a history of being counterproductive.</p>

This is a problematic statement. I&#39;m not going to get all philosophical, but this subreddit (reddit in general) are media outlets run by the people, for the people; not some group (there are mods but that is beside the point). People hating that retarded website is good, but the website should not be banned, for minimal censorship.</p>

<p>What say you all?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ll let Noam Chomsky answer:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The smart way to keep people passive and obedient is to strictly limit the spectrum of acceptable opinion, but allow very lively debate within that spectrum – even encourage the more critical and dissident views. That gives people the sense that there’s free thinking going on, while all the time the presuppositions of the system are being reinforced by the limits put on the range of the debate.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Noam Chomsky, <em>The Common Good</em>, 1998</p>

<p>Spaces in which to discuss that which is outside of the spectrum of generally acceptable discussion are vitally important in a free society. &quot;Conspiracies&quot; can be and often are ideas which simply exist outside of the spectrum of acceptable opinion, whether they end up being true or legitimate or not. I find many conspiracy theories to be absurd, offensive, dishonest, or simply insane, but conspiracy-spaces matter because some of those absurd, offensive, dishonest, or even insane ideas sometimes end up being right. How many times has that which was initially dismissed been proved true later? </p>

<p>That&#39;s why it&#39;s time that the current moderators of this subreddit be removed from their positions, for allowing such an important space to become another arm of a political movement, for banning and limiting the expression of uncomfortable or unpopular ideas, and most importantly in <strong>being wholly biased in their implementation of the rules</strong>. It would be one thing if CNN was banned and YourNewsWire was banned, but the fact that the rules apply to one source which is critical of the President and not to another source which is supportive is a clear indication that this is not /conspiracy, it&#39;s simply another wing of the alt-right and supporters of the current US administration. </p>

<p>All of them need to be removed now. No more chances to do the right thing. No more waiting. No more compromise. Remove them, all of them, immediately. </p>

<p>Until that happens, this subreddit does not deserve it&#39;s name, and meta threads like this will keep appearing day in and day out as the hypocrisy and bias of the moderators continues. </p>
