        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Steyer will allocate another $20M to build and support a troll army, including programmed bots, to push the Russia did &quot;It&quot; (insert your favorite), downvote social media posts that attempt to tell the truth, and engage with posters and commentators who are trying to refute the nonsense about &quot;interfering&quot;, &quot;colluding&quot;, &quot;hacking&quot; by the big bad bear.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.rawstory.com/2017/12/billionaire-trump-critic-is-building-social-media-army-to-fight-back-against-putins-russian-bots/">https://www.rawstory.com/2017/12/billionaire-trump-critic-is-building-social-media-army-to-fight-back-against-putins-russian-bots/</a></p>

<p>I have just engaged in a few back and forths (just for fun. - that&#39;s my excuse) with one of those commissioned types. Probably not the most recent cohort, and certainly not one of the more capable and/or informed ones, to judge by the shallow, low level MSM-derived pearls of &quot;wisdom&quot; strewn about.</p>

<p>I noticed the down votes on all the good comments that try to counter the MSM lies peddled by officially sanctioned shills (including on propaganda outlets such as CNN, MSNBC, PBS, etc) on a recent post by redditor who could apparently read and understand what really went down in the Seth Rich case. </p>

<p>I also noticed that there is an unusually large troll army dedicated to this one sub. The word has probably gone out to brigade any post or comment that has anything to do with Russia, RT, etc. I wonder whether anyone could tell me what the going price is? me thinks I could do quite well in this line of job (well, my rate may be a bit on the high side. Lawyer rates, you know....but who knows - if they are desperate enough, may be, may be?).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not very hard. You look for signs that you may be conversing with someone paid to produce their comment. Here are a few tell-tale signs:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The poster seems immune to discussing things outside their narrow area. For example, if knocking down RT is their beat, they will not be able to engage on content, even if that content was available far and wide, not just through RT.</p></li>
<li><p>The comments seem strangely &quot;wooden&quot;. Like someone parroting from a cheat-sheet, or reading from a teleprompter, or regurgitating talking points. You get the feeling there is little independent thought behind the words and zero creativity.</p></li>
<li><p>The commenter displays a complete absence of sense of humor and appears incapable of the kind of lighter hearted exchange typical of most humans, even when they might disagree on things.</p></li>
<li><p>By the same token, they seem difficult to provoke, and strangely resistant to the kind of displays of momentary anger that one might expect when you just ruffled another human&#39;s feathers. IOW, they are too impervious to be relying on their own true feelings (assuming they have some and it&#39;s not an outright program bot you are debating with but just a run-of-the-mill paid shill).</p></li>
<li><p>Some will come armed with lengthy tractates of points upon poiunts, all adding up to nothing much, but designed to confound and discourage the attention challenged among us. Beware of them who come ready armed with long lists, which are then recited and presented to a presumed awed audience. careful withi this point though - I come armed with lists too, and you can probably tell no one is paying me a dyme to say my piece(s).</p></li>
<li><p>The lines of argumentation being regurgitated take more than a page out of the daily MSM noxious emissions. IOW, they are fed daily talking points taken from the daily propaganda machine.</p></li>
<li><p>Some shills, instead of faking the appearance of erudition, are almost too simple to be belied. Even infantile. In reality, simpleton individuals are hardly likely to engage in any kind of debate as they know their limitations (OK, usually). They may drop a stink bomb and flee, but engage? not likely.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, trust your gut feeling. If it feels peeculiar and kind of wrong, it probably is. Remember who is really interested in coming to a site called &quot;conspiracy&quot;. They would likely be conspiracy buffs of one sort or another, right/ so why and who&#39;d bother to show up on such a site peddling normalcy and &quot;all is well. Keep walking&quot; lines? why would any non-conspiracy person, who is, say, rational, come here to rebut this or that assertion? is it because there those who care so much about &quot;truth&quot; and &quot;rationality&quot; that they will spend precious time debating some unknown commentator or poster about a notion in which they are not even vested?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>What I mean, is that short of people who want to discuss different types of theories about this or that possible conspiracy (and who may indeed debate those theories) and/or those who believe some conspiracies are more &quot;conspiratorially important&#39; than others, nearly all down-voters and MSM peddlers (ie, anything Russia, Russia) should be considered a shill as a default position. It is up to them to come out as otherwise, not up to you, a legitimate poster or commentator to prove to all and sundry that everything is a conspiracy. After all, by definition, details of most conspiracies are unknown.</p>

<p>Oh, and I hope you are asking the question in good faith. Rather than to get pointers for a better training manual for shills (never mind that - it&#39;s too damn hard to pretend to be a human that cares, no matter how good the AI or the training).</p>

<p>Not a single decent argument in the bunch, just baseless assertions, neither proven, nor upheld by anyone of some repute.</p>

<p>I could care less you disagree. I care about poor logic, and unsupported shiboleth. I gave you the list of how to recognize a shill. You are good on at least 4 of the counts (and we really only need one). I know, I know, it was too much to read, and you are still a shill-in-training.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I am not sure it&#39;ll be so funny because in the end they&#39;ll snare all sorts of people into the net and make many others afraid to speak their minds. Take Jill Stein for example. One photo at some dinner event, which many attended and many many more were invited to. During a time before Russia became a bad word by edict of the Deep State &amp; friends on left and right.</p>

<p>I do worry about the chill spreading across communication channels. And I worry about the effect on Russia and ordinary Russians. I happen to like a lot of things about Russian culture (classical music icons, nutcracker ballet, Dostoevsky, Tolstoy, many other great authors + the healthy sense of humor Russian people seem to have. The list of contributions to Western culture is enormous). I just harte the idea that we are suddenly supposed to think of them as enemies just because they could not be brought to their knees kow towing to American hegemony. And also because the MIC need the jobs or else the economy tanks.</p>

<p>So alas, there are things to worry about </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The cold war was instigated by the US and allies and many believe it did not have to be the way it was. But it was a great excuse to spend tax payers mnoney on armaments. Then, like now.</p>

<p>Also the modern Russia is nothing like the Soviet Union was. It is a major power now which is on the ascendancy even as the US Empire entered a period of precipitous decline. </p>

<p>So no, I rather like the emergent Russia. The one that produces real statesmen like Lavrov and real leaders like Putin and serious defense ministers like Shoigu. By contrast, what have we got other than jokers doing the bidding of a barely hidden snarling deep state? </p>

<p>Have you seen any statesmen/women lately? any competent defense minister? a competent president who can do something and accomplish something other than hand the country over to the corporatocracy ever faster?</p>

<p>Enemies, my foot. Our enemy - as the people of the USA - is the Depp State and the Corporate beholden Oligarchy that does its bidding.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Their crimes do not rise to the level of Comey, the liar puppet of the Deep State, Shawn Henry, the likely progenitor of Guccifer 2.0 and possible mastermind of the assassination of Seth Rich, the incompetent and corrupt deborah Wasserma who used the Awan brothers for who knows what (we&#39;ll never be allowed to know) and the MSM courtiers who can&#39;t bend their knees fast enough to the ruling corporatocracy. </p>

<p>What did mantafort do? same as most dirty businessmen up and down the countryside&gt; What did Flynn do? we still can&#39;t figure out what it was.</p>

<p>But Huma Abedin is running around free as a bird and Hillary still dares to speak despite being one of the most corrupt politicians we have had the dubious pleasure of witnessing.</p>

<p>And the idiots spreading the Russia, Russia hoax? they are still idiots, with absolutely zero to back any claim. </p>

<p>Somebody lied to the corrupt FBI? how sad. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My thread got downvoted to 0 points:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7mybdp/russia_hysteria_confirmed_comedians_tell_us/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7mybdp/russia_hysteria_confirmed_comedians_tell_us/</a></p>

<p>But a similar thread not on Russiagate being fake from the same source, submitted same time has 11 points.</p>

<p>Either my title triggered people or there are shills/bots pushing the russia thing.</p>

<p>How did OP get his 26 points thread (71% upvoted)? Maybe The_Donald shills can counteract the sharia blue ones ...</p>

<p>I think RES tags might be used by shills/brigaders somehow.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it was your title. Also, I suspect you are partly right about T_D shills counteracting the share blue and brockroach shills (did you mean to say sharia blue? if so, it&#39;s cute. I&#39;ll borrow, OK?).</p>

<p>RES tags are used among other cues, like key words used by certain programs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I read the article and others. The line was “can be used to target russian bots” not “is being used” theres a difference.</p>

<p>You’re making up your own story to suit your agenda. </p>

<p>Sounds like something a paid shill woukd do (that was sarcasm by the way)</p>
