    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m actually with you a bit on this.</p>

<p>Like people said, confirmation is good.  We knew (most people knew shit happened there or at least assumed it) Hollywood was fucked but receiving confirmation and having people come out is nice.</p>

<p>On the other hand small drop confirming things just makes you forget it.  Hollywood dropped a few and they still have a whole group there doing whatever.  And new people will continue for years again.</p>

<p>Confirming things just let&#39;s the masses sit back and relax.  Thinking they are on the job and will catch everyone!</p>

<p>And it works.  Confirming something obvious is an easy way to do such.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Makes the most sense to me. </p>

<p>If WikiLeaks information was accurate then it meant the people implicated would take coverup actions with deliberate timing, probably as soon as feasible. It&#39;s not even hard to fake an identity on the internet. Shutting up Assange was key. The persecution gave him legitimacy. If he is dead there&#39;s a new mouthpiece that can spit out truth and disinfo in the same breath.<em>cough</em> <sup>Alex</sup> <sup>Jones</sup> Credibility can be exploited. It&#39;s an effective propaganda strategy. Push an agenda, muddy the waters, silence an opponent. That&#39;s three motives. What is the motive to let Assange and friends live? </p>

<p>If WikiLeaks was just sloppy garbage would we really see such a convoluted and suspicious chain of events? How do you explain their seeming accuracy and predictive power? How do you counter the evidence they assemble?</p>

<p>If WikiLeaks was controlled intelligence from the beginning why would so many incriminating documents be released?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly, we are in for a real shit show mark my words.</p>

<p>He even told us they would do everything in their power to make it look like he&#39;s still alive which is why the PGP key signature is the only true proof of life. Has he enacted the proof of life? No, because Foolian is not Julian and therefore he does not have the key.
Foolian&#39;s explanation for not signing the key was that it would just prove that the person had it. Which of course is exactly the point but people are stupid so they believed the lame ass reasoning.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Where did he say PGP would be his proof of life? From what I remember he didn&#39;t want to sign anything with his PGP because it would set a precedent of a PGP being proof of life when it really isn&#39;t good enough. He has been outside the embassy since october and did a little speech. He was in front of tons of people so I&#39;m not so sure he is dead.</p>

<p>When FBIAnon said the CIA was going to launch a brilliant psyop against wikileaks I believe this is what he was talking about. How hard is it really to have some suspicious vans roaming around the embassy and then to cut his internet. Then seed the rumors around that he has been murdered, along with doing the blockchain psyop and boom you have people still doubting to this day if he is alive or not.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s pretty common for them to put out large encrypted insurance files on torrent before releasing the full context of what they contain. That gets it seeded in the public in case the authorities decide to intervene and a dead man&#39;s switch would then release keys. If I had to guess they probably invaded the lawyer&#39;s office the other day to figure out the mechanism of the switch in order to defeat it. Who knows maybe this file is different but I don&#39;t find it more suspicious than usual. Could also be a threat in case people are currently leaning on JA. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, apparently, this is an old insurance release and I&#39;m no longer surprised by Twitter outages: remember when Rose-Anne got banned? I never caught the explanation for that.</p>

<p>Pretty sure we are seeing automated anti-intrusion systems in play. Chances are the Twitter accounts were accessed in an irregular way, so they lock it down until Two-Factor authentication can ensure the right user is connecting. </p>

<p>That said, I miss the days when Wikileaks just released diplomatic cables. They&#39;ve changed a lot since then. They&#39;ve gotten stuck on specific obsessions and almost as sensationalist as the mainstream media, and there&#39;s a strange bias I can&#39;t quite put my finger on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Rosanne got banned immediately after asking &quot;who is q&quot; and her website got blocked too... that one&#39;s obvious. You didn&#39;t know that? Damn... Also not quite, his twitter was deleted and all of his followers too, while the navy tweeted &quot;julian assange&quot; - yeah no fucking way - not a chance in hell this is &quot;coincidence&quot; hahaha </p>

    <div class="md"><p>She actually promised to explain  that one. I suspect there is more to it -- Twitter can&#39;t deactivate your website.</p>

<p>I feel like you don&#39;t really understand what coincidence is and have a hard time with causality: what if I told you the Navy tweeted that <em>after</em> his account disappeared, in response to it?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Nothing suggests this is related to Clinton, Huma, Podesta or anything, really. All we can gather is that it may be an insurance package.</p></li>
<li><p>I&#39;ve yet to see a leak strongly suggesting &quot;sick satanic pedo weird shit&quot;. The closest was &#39;spirit cooking&#39;, and that was a real nothingburger at the end of the day.</p></li>
<li><p>This package is from 2012: this suggests we may have already seen the contents of this file released, and that the files are likely unrelated to the Clinton email leaks, as those included emails from after this package would be made [the last Clinton emails date to 2014, so unless they were fabricated, they won&#39;t be in this archive].</p></li>
<li><p>If the package contents were verifiable, they would likely have been released publically in a previous leak. Chances are this is supporting documentation or unverified information deemed unworthy of release: too suspect or too tenuous.</p></li>
<li><p>Assange is online Twitter again and he doesn&#39;t seem to be acknowledging this release. I don&#39;t know if this file has been authenticated at all by Wikileaks.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>So, I have to ask: why should I presume this content is Weiner&#39;s laptop? Why should I presume this is Clinton related, and not just a grand dump of all Wikileaks files from the era? Should we believe anything we&#39;re told?</p>
