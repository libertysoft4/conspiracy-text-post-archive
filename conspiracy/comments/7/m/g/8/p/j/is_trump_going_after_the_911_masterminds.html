    <div class="md"><p>Actually, most of the changes going on in SA are internally motivated. Two main reasons for this:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Money is tight. Due to the price of gas, the Saud family is looking to tighten up their budget on both ends of the equation. They&#39;ve been paying out less to family members, and they&#39;ve been trying to find new sources of income (read: seizures of property, freezing bank accounts, and arresting people for crimes that might have been previously overlooked)</p></li>
<li><p>Cold wars with neighbors have them looking more closely at shady domestic operations. Arms dealers and others who stand to profit during a war are being brought under the thumb.</p></li>
<li><p>Arab Spring/Wahabism: As the House of Saud loses economic grip over the region, it has been forced to rethink its ties with wahabist groups and terrorism. They are trying to &quot;clean things up&quot; and simplify relationships with those who in the past may have been accepted as part of the &quot;price of doing business&quot;</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>In short, no. Why don&#39;t people understand that we don&#39;t have a &quot;savior&quot;. Very few people in office give a shit about us, the general public. They may have started that way but the corruption in Washington runs so deep that they don&#39;t stay that way for long. Trump is not here to save the people just like Hillary wouldn&#39;t have, just like Bernie wouldn&#39;t have. The sooner we realize that and come to the understanding that the ones that can help us ARE us, the sooner the changes that need to actually occur will occur. </p>
