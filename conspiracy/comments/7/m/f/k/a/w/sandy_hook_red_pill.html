<p>And ask yourself this, why was it left out of the transcript?</p>

<p>First, if you think its a big cover up then why would they leave that fucking audio in there?</p>

<p>Second, who berated her? The person that said &quot;Hang up, get off that phone&quot;? How do you know that the person that said &quot;there&#39;s a rumor its fake&quot; and the person being told to get off the phone is a different person? You don&#39;t.</p>

<p>Third, I think its perfectly rational to understand that Jen, if she was the person who said it might be fake, was probably on a phone call that was inconsequential during a time when the station was being bombarded with calls. Therefore, her services were needed elsewhere. Like answering the flood of phone calls that the station was getting. </p>

<p>That is not suspicious. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Do we have any proof that the camera was working? Also...not suspicious. Footage from a crime is not going to be released unless there is a reason to. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>And I&#39;m not asking for pictures of dead bodies or anything like that, just a picture of the person who supposedly did the shooting entering the school.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why? The fact that there is a camera system but no picture or video is not suspicious. I wish I had a $100 for every case I&#39;ve ever prosecuted where there was a camera in the building that was turned off or not working. </p>

<p>So--none of that indicates conspiracy. That indicates someone borrowed or stole someone else&#39;s car and that a camera system or single camera wasn&#39;t working or the police just never released the footage, which is normal.</p>

<p>this is a Cytel display, likely at some sort of trade show, showing posters for &quot;Urban Shield Boston&quot; in the background</p>

<p>Urban Shield is the DHS program where they do mass casualty drills such as the Boston Marathon Bombing </p>

<p>as mentioned in Richard Serino&#39;s FEMA profile page</p>

<p>no, you are playing stupid, trying to ride a fine line between making mass casualty drills seem completely normal and expected at the boston marathon, but also trying to convince us that there wasn&#39;t one happening at this particular Boston Maraton, in spite of the incident being planned, and the plans even including the use of backpacks with explosives.  </p>

<p>even the american pyrotechnics association called bullshit on this fake bomb</p>

<p>I&#39;m not playing stupid. What you&#39;re saying makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. It might make sense to you, but it makes no sense to me or most intelligent people. So if you want to argue it, fine, but <strong>you need to actually make a fucking argument and not throw a bunch of links on the page and tell people to put it together</strong>. That is your way of avoiding making claims, and therefore avoiding accountability. Your entire method of argument is designed to escape scrutiny, and I&#39;m afraid you picked the wrong target for that nonsense.</p>

<p>There is precisely nothing suspicious about Serino--a Boston native--being present at the race. If you want to argue it is suspicious, then you need to explain why.</p>

<p>Because you&#39;re incapable of creating an organized argument, we&#39;re just doing this one thing at a time.</p>

<p><strong>Explain why Serino being at that finish line was suspicious.</strong></p>

<p>And I will cut off a few threads immediately.</p>

<p>His job is irrelevant, and does not make him being there suspicious.</p>

<p>Go.</p>

<p>That is a thought terminating cliche. It&#39;s funny that someone who should supposedly care about truth is resorting to thought terminating cliches. Rofl.</p>

<p>But you don&#39;t care about truth, as I stated. And no, I didn&#39;t look at your video. My link previewer shows a kid&#39;s show, and I&#39;m not a child.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>The point of this article is to discuss disaster readiness. The article is trying to show the police in a good light--showing that they are preparing for these sorts of things. It&#39;s meant to be reassuring and calming.</p>

<p>This is a typical sort of news item you see after disasters like this. It&#39;s supposed to make people feel good (which sells--it&#39;s infotainment). </p>

<p>I see nothing suspicious in this article. It seems like a typical feel-good piece that you see written all the time after a major attack like this. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>so, as a professional evidence analyst </p>

<p>what do you suppose FEMA deputy administrator Richard Serino was actually doing at the Boston Marathon finish line, at the same time as other agencies resources were also deployed to the Boston Marathon area?</p>

<p>was Richard Serino innocently having a beer, celebrating a non-Federal holiday, watching also-rans finish the Boston Marathon, </p>

<p>and also inexplicably NOT doing a planned mass casualty event, as he had in previous years? </p>

<p>or was Richard Serino actually on-the-job, as a Federal employee, doing his job as incident commander for a mass casualty drill, as he had in previous years?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, having discussed this with you and learned what the key points seem to be for you...</p>

<p>Why don&#39;t you do an FOIA request for 1) the Lietenant&#39;s logbook for that precinct and 2) any email with the word &quot;drill&quot; for the 2 weeks leading up to the marathon?</p>

<p>It is standard procedure to inform the police if you are running a drill. Also, it is standard procedure for the supervisor (a Lt.) to mark in their logbook that a drill took place, who ran the drill, what time it started, what time it ended, and what time a verifying officer gave the all clear.</p>

<p>I have no idea how much those will cost. The logbook for the day will be cheap relatively. The emails may cost more.</p>

<p>But if you really want to prove there is a drill, just do an FOIA request for those items.</p>

<p>But you never will.</p>

<p>You know, this is a great example of why you should learn to rely on evidence. If you had some, you could actually stand a chance here. But you have none, and so you have to hide behind a thin excuse of &quot;I have it, but I&#39;m just not going to tell you.&quot;</p>

<p>That stopped working on the playground. If you have evidence, supply it.</p>

<p>you can&#39;t exactly say &quot;cheese&quot; for a photo of this gravity</p>

<p>so what did the photographer say to them?</p>

<p>ok mom, here, hold this photograph and look off into space and pretend like you don&#39;t see me or that you are aware that your picture is being taken</p>

<p>and dad, you look off into space in another direction, so that its obvious that there is nothing interesting enough for both of you to be looking at, while you pretend to be ignoring me</p>

<p>I could grant you all of those things as true, and it doesn&#39;t make it staged...have you ever been around photographers? They are taking pictures constantly.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>so what did the photographer say to them?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Probably nothing at all. Photographers are usually snapping pictures in rapid, silent shutter mode with telescopic lenses. They usually are sitting in a group, so they are out of the way but so they can get their pictures. This looks like they were getting ready for a broadcast of some sort. Maybe an interview with the media.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?429381-1/fbi-director-comey-testifies-dismissal">https://www.c-span.org/video/?429381-1/fbi-director-comey-testifies-dismissal</a></p>

<p>Skip to the 1 minute mark. That&#39;s what photographers are normally doing. This looks like a candid shot taken by a kneeling photographer with a telescopic lens (you can tell that by the flatness of the picture). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I&#39;ve considered it. It&#39;s irrelevant. Whether that is happening or not, evidence analysis and the law of parsimony remain the only valid method of researching claims even if that is true. In fact, they remain such <em>because</em> it is true.</p>

<p>So, again, there is nothing in that photo that is suspicious. If there was evidence that it was suspicious, we wouldn&#39;t be having a discussion about void spaces.</p>

<p>Put simply: if it is true that I am projecting my own assumptions into a void space, that means that there is a void space, and if there is a void space, that means there is no evidence.</p>

<p>So, please explain what is suspicious about that photo in 50 words or less real fast. What about it seems off to you?</p>

<p>Yeah, not buying that happened. So far, his &quot;side&quot; seemed more convincing than yours. BUT, you are here and he is not, which means you are going to have that home field advantage. </p>

<p>Thus far, that formation appears natural to me, and it appears natural to experts who have talked about it. And holes like this aren&#39;t always filled. Filling costs money. You only fill if you need to. the fact that it was empty and the fact that the towers stood just fine seems to indicate that it didn&#39;t need to be filled.</p>

<p>So please, convince me. I&#39;m open to hearing you. But so far, I see nothing that would indicate that that is not natural.</p>

<p>if you are going to be building a heavy structure, typically you will dig down to at least below the frost line, to prevent heaving</p>

<p>also, typically the bigger and heavier a building is, the more they will excavate, so while a house may have a one story basement, a skyscraper may have a 10 story basement</p>

<p>also, typically if you are going to be building a big, heavy building, you will excavate down to the bedrock if possible, to start from a nice solid base </p>

<p>you may remember the parable about the man who built his house upon the sand?</p>

<p>so as they excavate for a skyscraper, they would have discovered this so-called pot-hole, and they would have had to prepare it for construction </p>

<p>since we don&#39;t see any evidence of footing or foundation construction, </p>

<p>we must entertain the possibility that this bed rock was recently molten, </p>

<p>just like the steel that was molten, &quot;like in a foundry&quot; as described by FDNY </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBNkw2Vvi28">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBNkw2Vvi28</a></p>

<p>There is no &quot;typically&quot; in the construction of skyscrapers. They are all idiosyncratic. If you want to make a claim this is typical, please provide evidence.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>No. That does not logically follow. You&#39;re skipping steps.</p>

<p>Premise 1: Skyscrapers usually excavate down to bedrock.
Premise 2: The pothole was in a structurally significant position.
Premise 3: The pothole was not filled in.
Premise 4: Potholes like this would normally be filled in.
Premise 5: Small nukes would make the ground hot for months.</p>

<p>That&#39;s what you&#39;re working with.</p>

<p>Premise 1-4 are all unverified. They must be verified before going further.</p>

<p>Premise 5 is simply wrong. Nukes of any size would not make the ground warm for months. That is simply not true.</p>

<p>you are the one who claimed, without any evidence whatsoever, that the molten rock was old and natural. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Wrong. That rock does not appear molten. I claimed that it appears natural. I don&#39;t need evidence to make that claim: rock being natural is the default unless shown otherwise. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>i dont think there is any doubt that the bed rock was molten. the question is why they would build a skyscraper in an uneven pothole instead of starting with a nice level base like they usually do when building most buildings?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is doubt. That doesn&#39;t look molten to me. It looks like ice-weathered rock, which is what all the experts I&#39;ve read have said. And as for why they would not fill in the pot hole, I&#39;ve answered that already.  Filling it costs money. That means that unless there was a reason to do so, they wouldn&#39;t do it. That means that the empty pothole is the default assumption sans other evidence.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>are you actually arguing against the fact that skyscrapers have solid bases that are below the frost line?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m not arguing anything. I&#39;m taking the skeptical position.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the pot hole is so significant that Richard Gage actually abandoned his AMA and claimed it was an imposter</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is not how that appeared to me. I&#39;m sure you see it that way. I didn&#39;t see it that way.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>clearly he understands the engineering of skyscrapers better than you</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s fine. Provide citations to relevant points. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>which is why he quit while he was still ahead, or actually before he got even more deep. he knew he was toast</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is not how it appeared to me, again. He seemed like he was brushing off what to him seemed nonsense questions. That&#39;s how he seemed to respond to it, and I personally did not find anything you said convincing. You&#39;re not going to be able to use that conversation as evidence at any stage of this conversation. But that&#39;s ok, we&#39;re talking now and you can just cite direct evidence.</p>

<p>1) Skyscrapers usually excavate down to bedrock. 
2) The pothole was in a structurally significant position
3) The pothole was not filled in
4) Potholes like this would normally be filled in
5) Small nukes would make the ground hot for months. 
6) The ground being warm for months is relevant in the first place.
7) The ground was actually warmer than normal for months.</p>

<p>Those are what we&#39;re dealing with. Let&#39;s take them one at a time. I added #7, and we know that #5 is false to begin with. That is fine, it&#39;s not critical to your argument, so your argument endures regardless of that point.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s take this one at a time. Let&#39;s start with 1. That one I don&#39;t find unlikely, and indeed a quick search supports it.</p>

<p><a href="http://observer.com/2012/01/uncanny-valley-the-real-reason-there-are-no-skyscrapers-in-the-middle-of-manhattan/">http://observer.com/2012/01/uncanny-valley-the-real-reason-there-are-no-skyscrapers-in-the-middle-of-manhattan/</a></p>

<p>So, premise 1 is verified.  We can move one.</p>

<p>I can find no evidence for premise 2. Perhaps you can show me evidence that indicates that this pot hole was in a critical location.</p>

<p>There is in fact. This comment alone is enough for me to assume you to be the caricature you insist you are not. It&#39;s foolish, arrogant, and dismissive. I would give you a video to watch, but like everyone else who says this, they never watch it. I would also offer all the inconsistencies as well, but as many who make your claim will refute each and every one as coincidence. I would point out Gene&#39;s prep video, the dad smiling at a press conference, the overhead chopper footage, so on and so on goes all the nonsense involved in trying to tell the story and stick to a narrative that has been picked clean apart. So for you to so arrogantly sit there and write that there is ZERO evidence shows me that you have done ZERO research in to the subject and are simply trying to sandbag this entire conversation regarding the subject.</p>

<p>Negative. I don&#39;t have to explain anything. The burden of proof is not might. That&#39;s not how this works. </p>

<p>Evidence is evidence if and only if it indicates something conclusively. </p>

<p>Again, that is not a burden I have to meet. I don&#39;t have to prove it was real. You have to prove it was a hoax. </p>

<p>Extraordinary claims demand extraordinary evidence. The fact that this was a real disaster is the default position. It is true until <em>you</em> prove otherwise.  I don&#39;t have to prove it really happened. You have to prove it didn&#39;t. It&#39;s a one way street.</p>

<p>I&#39;m heading to bed. I will save this post and head through it in the morning. It should be short work. A short look at it shows that most of what you posted has already been debunked (e.g., the facebook page listed as #1 never happened--it was fake). </p>

<p>So, number 2 on that list:</p>

<p>It was a standard, normal, typical, happens every day, inaccurate google time stamp caused (most likely) by incorrect metadata.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/09/united-way-sandy-hook_n_2442450.html">https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/09/united-way-sandy-hook_n_2442450.html</a></p>

<p>The same applies to #3 on the list--it&#39;s just another google timestamp error.</p>

<h1>4 is easy. He just fucking started the fund. I recently had a friend who died. I started the fund for his wife and kids within 30 minutes of receiving the phone call. Not hard.</h1>

<h1>5 is easy. People move into new areas all the time. There is nothing suspicious about people moving into a neighborhood.</h1>

<h1>6, the script</h1>

<p>The script has been debunked.</p>

<p><a href="http://sandyhookanalysis.blogspot.com/2014/07/debunked-wolfgang-w-habligs-script.html">http://sandyhookanalysis.blogspot.com/2014/07/debunked-wolfgang-w-habligs-script.html</a></p>

<p>This is one of countless such pages. </p>

<p>So, there. Section 1 is entirely debunked. I&#39;ll hit the second section tomorrow. In the mean time, squirm.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>LOL you linked huff post. Get the fuck out of here.</p>

<p>You did not debunk the first question.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>(e.g., the facebook page listed as #1 never happened--it was fake). It is most likely that someone took an already existing and unused facebook group and renamed / repurposed it. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is not a fact, you are speculating.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It was a standard, normal, typical, happens every day, inaccurate google time stamp caused (most likely) by incorrect metadata.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, not a fact, you are speculating. A billion dollar corporation have bad meta data and a time stamp when it&#39;s 99.9% in fallible?</p>

<p>Same with your answer for #3, you don&#39;t provide a fact to a bad timestamp, only speculation.</p>

<p>As for #4, I came to the same conclusion, it&#39;s still very shady for a bank manager to be the first one on it. This is probably one of my least concerns on the list, congrats, you found one you could &quot;debunk&quot; with a logical explanation.</p>

<p>You are speculating again on number 5. </p>

<p>You page debunking number six omits a lot of detail. Also the person who wrote it up debunking it does not explain how the written time stamp reports don&#39;t match the video timestamps. I guess in your case you just don&#39;t think timestamps are accurate do you? Your dunking page is a load of bullshit, they were picking and choosing what help drives the narrative. Did you find that page from a google search? You probably did.</p>

<p>So far you did not debunk anything, I am not squirming, because you have offered no facts, only speculation. </p>

<p>The proof of you not doing any research over this and not reading any official documents if glaring at this point. </p>

<p>Oh how I eagerly await you next round of speculation.</p>

<p>That google timemarks are not valid is a fact. It is speculating to say it was accurate here.</p>

<p>1-3 are debunked.</p>

<p>There is nothing shady about a man who manages money using his skills to aid victims. That is like saying its shady for a doctor to render aid to victims,</p>

<p>4 is debunked.</p>

<p>It is not speculation to say that people move into neighborhoods all the time. That is a fact. It is speculation on the part of this list to say that it is suspicious.</p>

<p>5 is debunked.</p>

<p>Regarding 6</p>

<p>No, time stamps are not evidence, because they are essentially never accurate, as was shown regarding 1-3. </p>

<p>The page I gave is not bullshit. They didn&#39;t pick and choose. They proved, point for point, that the scrip is full of inaccuracies. That debunks it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So far you did not debunk anything, I am not squirming, because you have offered no facts, only speculation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wrong. The list you gave me is speculation. I gave not only reasonable, but most probable, explanations for all of the issues to show that none of them are suspicious, and have very simple, common explanations. </p>

<p>1-6 are debunked. If you are going to claim otherwise at this point, the burden of proof is over to you. I showed that they are debunked and gave evidence for each one of them. None of them is speculation. They are all verified facts. Google timestamps are not accuarte. That is a fact. I proved it. The man handling the aid is normal and not suspicious. That is a fact. I proved it. People moving into a neighborhood is normal and not suspicious. That is a fact. I proved it. The script is bullshit. It is continuously wrong from point to point. And further, there is no evidence to prove that it existed prior to the event. There is no evidence it is a real document. As it stands, it is a document that did not appear until after the fact and it is full of errors, which I&#39;ve proven. In terms of probabilistic explanation based on current evidence, it is orders of magnitude more likely that the script was a forgery by Halbig, and a poor forgery at that. The script is bullshit. That is a fact. I proved it.</p>

<p>1-6 are debunked.</p>

<p>If you wish to dispute it, then do so in a numbered list. </p>

<p>And I want to keep this on point an brief. Please organize your responses in an organized fashion. Discuss each point separately, and no more than 50 words per point. Quotes and links, etc., obviously do not count.</p>

<p>I will respond to your points. When you are done.</p>

<p>((Debate is adversarial by nature. I would like to step out of the adversarial position for a moment to thank you for having the discussion in the first place)).</p>

<p>Questions without answers is not speculation. </p>

<p>I can&#39;t take you seriously, especially when you claim failing timestamps with no proof, then call it proof and fact.

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I did not speculate anything. Timestamps on google are not reliable. That is a fact. That is not speculation. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Questions without answers is not speculation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, they are. A question makes a claim when it is asked.</p>

<p>&quot;Is the cheese on the moon green or blue?&quot;</p>

<p>That question makes the claim that there is cheese on the moon. Questions make claims, make arguments, make implications, and make thesis statements.  In fact, a question is called a thesis. A thesis statement is the answer to a thesis (aka, question).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why was a Facebook webpage for the alleged dead teacher Victoria Soto of Sandy Hook Elementary School posted before the event occurred?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is the first question. That question makes the claim that that page was created before the event happened. It is speculating that that is true. </p>

<p>However, there is not evidence that it is true. The only evidence is a FB timestamp, and <strong>I have proven that a facebook timestamp does not prove when a named group is created</strong>.</p>

<p>This question makes two claims.</p>

<ol>
<li>Facebook time-stamps prove when groups are made.</li>
<li>The facebook time-stamp shows this group predates the attack.</li>
</ol>

<p>Based on these premises, the following conclusion is reached.</p>

<ol>
<li>Because FB time-stamps prove when a group is made, and because the the time-stamp for this group predates the attack, this proves that the FB page was made before the attack.</li>
</ol>

<p>I proved, beyond any dispute, that that time stamp does not mean anything. That means that means that premise 1 above is not true, and that means that there is no evidence to support the conclusion.</p>

<p>Thus, 1 is debunked. </p>

<p>Nothing above is speculated. It is all verified fact. </p>

<p>The only speculation that exists is &quot;despite time stamps not being an indicator of when a named group is created, I believe that in this case the time stamp is correct.&quot;</p>

<p>That is your speculation.</p>

<p>So, 1 remains debunked until you come up with a new argument.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I can&#39;t take you seriously, especially when you claim failing timestamps with no proof, then call it proof and fact. If you can get google and facebook to admit to it being a failed timestamp, then you can counter the claim, until then, they were made when the timestamps said they were made.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I proved with evidence that timestamps are not accurate. And because they are not accurate, they cannot be used as evidence. That is proven. I used evidence. If you wan to argue against that claim, then you need to do so. You don&#39;t get to just keep claiming that time stamps are valid when I&#39;ve proven with evidence that you can check yourself that they are not accurate.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You probably got a really good speculation for Gene Rosen&#39;s leaked video, and probably even better one for the police reports that mention children evacuating the building, yet on camera it never happens, but it must be another timestamp error right?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We&#39;re not to that yet. You still haven&#39;t gotten past 1-6. So far they all stand debunked. You disagree. You need to prove it.</p>

<p>The hangup at the moment is 1-3. I&#39;ve proven that the timestamps are meaningless. Either you give up 1-3 and we move on (after all, you have 30 left), or you need to prove that the timestamps should be considered reliable.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve proven that 4 is nothing. You&#39;ve agreed. So we&#39;re down to 32.</p>

<p>You haven&#39;t gotten to 5 yet, but that is not one you will win. </p>

<p>6 will be a long argument I think. We&#39;ll take it when we get to it though.  </p>

<p>Right now, let&#39;s focus on 1-5.  You&#39;ve conceded 4, so really, 1-3 and 5. Before we can proceed, you must defend the following arguments.</p>

<p>1) Despite <a href="/u/nologicjustpathos">/u/nologicjustpathos</a> having proven that the timestamps on FB and google are notoriously unreliable, the timestamps in this case should be trusted because of <strong>X</strong></p>

<p>Of course, you have to provide <strong>X</strong></p>

<p>2) It is unusual for families to move into a neighborhood OR into neighborhood <strong>Y</strong> in manner <strong>Z</strong>.</p>

<p>You of course choose Y and Z.</p>

<p>If you cannot defend those arguments, then you cannot sustain 1-3 or 5. </p>

<p>Please again, no more than 50 words for argument 1 or 2 (excluding links, etc.).</p>

</blockquote>

<p>No, they aren&#39;t. I work in the IT sector, been doing it for 30 years, and no they are not notoriously unreliable. You have to go WAAAAY out of you way to fake a timestamp, and for a timestamp to fail, you are talking about a serious hardware failure or a failing code, which would create a huge slew of failed timestamps. It cannot be correlated to that day they were claimed to be created. There are no other existing timestamp errors from that day on google or facebook.</p>

<p>But I guess since a redditor told you that makes it a fact. If you don&#39;t have experience in what I am talking about, you have no experience, and someone claiming unreliability is lying. Bottom line, there&#39;s no debating it away, they are lying. Errors occur, this is given with technology, however the percentage of failure is incredibly low.</p>

<p>At this point you are just rehashing your insistence that you are not speculating to garner favor to your points. You have not disproved anything so far, you have a long way to go down the list and if you are going to just circlejerk over your claims without going through the rest of the list, and also watch the video, then I can see where this entire thing is headed and I am just not interested in your opinion. I am only interested in fact, and you have yet to provide a single that that as you claim, destroys everyone on this subject.</p>

<p>You can claim how much your facts are verified, this doesn&#39;t make it a fact. </p>

<p>I can see how desperately you want to be right, it&#39;s quite sad. You are desperately are trying to push the official narrative, and it&#39;s sad. You want to desperately deny any and all inconsistencies, and that too is very sad. </p>

<p>I wonder, how long did it take you before you believed that 9/11 was not an actual terrorist attack and was a controlled demo? </p>

<p>We&#39;ll have that discussion once we&#39;re done with this one.</p>

It was a cover up but of what I don&#39;t know. It is interesting for people who like to go down rabbit holes but hard to convince people something was covered up. I trust Fetzer about as far as I can throw him. His pdf got a lot of stuff wrong, his claims of Carver being at the school prior to the shooting are easily debunked if you have watched all the shadow analyses videos.</p>

<p>Some stuff to look into with SH.  Purple van with priests and nun(costume) BOLO, poorly photoshopped images of many of the children like Ben Wheeler and well the entire Parker family as well as Viki Soto, Green screen at firehouse, pedophile and meth head priests at st rose of lima, Gene Rosin or his doppleganger photographed at a fema event, Google and Bing cache of united way charity page, Dawn Hochsprung writing a Newtown Bee article from the grave and Newtown police dept selling coke, steroids and weapons.</p>

<p>Youtube channel Aryan Empires&#39;s Reich watch videos. That guy has read and done videos on an impressive amount of documents in relation to SH. His research makes me question some of the more mainstream SH theories.</p>

<p>1) Laziness on the part whoever runs the school website (or being busy, cause if you have a kid you know how much unplanned shit can happen)</p>

<p>2) Privacy for the kids</p>

<p>3) No need to be advertised/shown. We don&#39;t have choir boosters at our school.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>after the Sandy Hook fake shooting happened, a bunch of kids showed up to sing in a choir at the Super Bowl, in front of the whole world, perhaps as a proof-of-life idk</p>

<p>but the kids at the Super Bowl were aged a few years older than the kids who were allegedly killed at Sandy Hook, leading people to believe that the supposed victims were prepared well in advance, their pictures taken, and the kids allowed to age a few years, to later help hide them in plain sight, in places like the Super Bowl. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>yeah <a href="http://crisisactors.org">http://crisisactors.org</a> denies involvement too</p>

<p>but whats most interesting about these crisis actor troupes denying involvement is the existence of these crisis actor troupes in the first place</p>

<p>like when did crisis actors get normalized?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hahaha it&#39;s always the people with absolutely 0 real argument that go after punctuation and spelling mistakes. The absolute lamest argument on the Internet and I&#39;m actually a little shocked that&#39;s what you chose to use. But of course you are from there and knew Adam Lanza, there&#39;s always someone in this small ass sub from one of those hick ass towns that claim they knew someone who was affected. So in the whole area of 11,000 people, you saw Adam Lanza, remember seeing him for some reason, and still think the parents of school children wouldn&#39;t know the other parents in the school? Can you reach anymore? And you know the cops who were first on scene? Oh well of course you do. My uncle works at Sony and just sent me a PS5. </p>

<p>So if you are so friendly with all of these first on the scene police, why don&#39;t you have any extra info? Not many people make the huge claim that they know the first cops on the scene. I&#39;m pretty sure they would ALL know an exact body count, and being small town cops and knowing the families why would every single one go along with a fake story about child deaths in their town?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>trust me, i&#39;m not one that goes after punctuation or spelling mistakes...i make a ton of my own.  You got the name of the subject wrong...you didnt spell it wrong, you got the name wrong.

They dont...</p>

<p>anyway, my story has been the same on here. I dont care if you believe it or not that wasn&#39;t my intention.  The point was that you dont know what you&#39;re talking about but are pretending that you do.  You clearly dont though.</p>

<p>So, back to the topic.  The records are sealed.  We get what they tell us regardless of if its true or not.  We never got to see photos of the classroom, the guns, lanza, the kids, autopsy reports, police recordings..nothing.  That is enough to know something is afoot.  My own personal stuff doesnt matter.  What I just said is enough.</p>

<p>but you are such a dimwit that you believe everything you see on CNN</p>

<p>well this particular detail about the obituaries is a bit obscure, and you will probably not hear anyone mention it outside of this thread, which is why you were probably taken aback by the argument</p>

<p>i actually used to believe that the sandy hook shooting was real, and didn&#39;t question it too much</p>

<p>but then the boston marathon bombing happened and that was obviously fake</p>

<p>and the some of the same crisis actors started showing up at different events</p>

<p>one &quot;false witness&quot; showed up in 3 different places, and her acting skills are very bad</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok. So here&#39;s the thing, purely in the interest of clarity.</p>

<p>When you say &#39;fake&#39;, you are referring to the fact that at Sandy Hook (and other such far-to-common false flag violent events), people weren&#39;t killed, and it was purely a fabrication, acted out like an avant-garde theatre piece, packaged with a bow, and delivered up by Anderson Cooper, yeah? </p>

<p>If so, i disagree with you there, and i&#39;ll come back to that, but i don&#39;t contest your right to believe it (of course).</p>

<p>Here&#39;s where i think we can agree;</p>

<p>You referenced other events, and generally believe in a massive shadowy corporo-military-industrial-mass-media-complex that behind the scenes is controlling/exploiting/doing/faking (as a single example of many and more) these ever-frequent displays of grandiose violence. </p>

<p>Of course, this is a tiny shred of the explanation of all the global connections of something we might as well refer to as the &#39;New World Order,&#39; only because many in the moderately-recent past have accurately foretold what was to come and they oft referred to it as such. We are seeing it manifest now more than ever. They are getting sloppier and less shadowed by the day, and are throwing our world into chaos with a specific purpose -- to have dominion over our hearts and minds.</p>

<p>I certainly believe that there are some startling similarities in many of these cases (the aforementioned Boston event, the Colorado Theatre Shooting, etc) in the way that they are presented, packaged, swiftly swept under the rug of our collective saturated media feedback-loops. I could go on forever. That&#39;s why were here, in the conspiracy sub.</p>

<p>Make no mistake, we see the same enemy. However, one of the tactics i&#39;ve seen used over and over again, and far more frequently as our world has evolved into this hyper-connected, post-modern social hellscape is on display here, coming from you.</p>

<p>Now, i won&#39;t claim to know if you are directly and deliberately steering these conversations down these obscure and twisted rabbit-holes with the specific intention of pulling the wool over others&#39; eyes distracting them from the ever-reaching scale of the current political/socioeconomic/etc landscape. </p>

<p>Nor will i say with confidence that your nitpicking and misdirected focus on small details of specific events is more of a compulsion, because the powers that be have deliberately led <em>you</em> (and others) there, with the same intentions and result of distracting the rest of us and keeping our focus within a severely limited spectrum, while <em>they</em> are gallivanting around scorching the earth, hoarding the wealth, and pillaging resources to prepare for the coming collapse.</p>

<p>The point is, whether you personally believe that people died or not shouldn&#39;t logically be the topic of discussion. It&#39;s this alone that leaves me suspect to your intentions. I&#39;ve believed for years (i&#39;ve been here quite a long time, on sequential accounts) that the cry of &#39;SHILL!&#39; is far too common (now more than ever) on this board, and often comes with no explanation other than a disagreement, more often than not on small details of specific events that, in the grand scheme, are irrelevant. However, it&#39;s hard for me to feel like i couldn&#39;t make a good argument for that very declaration.</p>

<p>The true, critical argument lies on an entire dimension higher than the 2D eternity of these disputes. We need to be exploring our common held beliefs, and i posit that they exist in a 3 dimensional universe. The shadowy, &#39;NWO&#39;, &#39;illuminati&#39; (whatever you want to call it) exists. They are fighting harder than ever in a war for our minds, attention, vulnerabilities, souls. </p>

<p>We must stop this descent into madness. The absolute best weapon TPTB have in this war is their ability to keep us squabbling over crudely drawn lines. So long we remain under their boot shaking fists at each other, we will never see who really weighs heaviest on the scales of modern society. </p>

<p>Our numbers will never be realized. Our common goal of exposing, stopping, spreading awareness, WHATEVER of those that would exploit, control, deceive, MURDER us to further their goals of absolute totalitarian rule, maintain the integrity of their hierarchy of absolute violence, and distract us from the fact that none of us are getting tickets to the Denver Airport doomsday bunker when they decide to start firing nukes at each other.</p>

<p>Is Sandy Hook another in a long list of suspicious PSYchological OPerationS of the powers that be? Absolutely. We could go deep into every event, and find a million little connections, deliberately false COunterINTELligence PROgramming, etc. But what is common about them, who is ultimately perpetrating these operations, who is benefiting, how, and why? These are the questions we need to be exploring.</p>

<p>So you may believe in your heart that Sandy Hook (and possibly others) was merely an act of theatre, with no victims. I would suggest that you don&#39;t scream that at people who believe that kids died. I know this could be spun out of context to sound almost preposterous, but honestly the event, &#39;real&#39; victims or not, is used in THE EXACT SAME MANNER, regardless of the truth. </p>

<p>So, you can see how, for those people who believe real bullets tore through the real flesh of real children that day, might mistake this barrage of an ultimately irrelevant argument as a deliberate method of keeping the conversation on specifically mega-obscure singular points of contention. To further the agenda of, AT ALL COSTS, impeding the ability of the common, working class, ninety-nine percent of us uniting against them in any way. </p>

<p>So it&#39;s actually up to you, what other people believe in the end. Are you working for them, and is this on purpose (kids died)? Or have you been led down this path following the dangling carrot of sanctimony (there weren&#39;t victims)? It doesn&#39;t matter either way, you are a shill, or you have been misled deliberately by those that would have you distracted. It&#39;s up to you, really.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>perhaps Karl Rove explained it best</p>

<p>&#39;We&#39;re an empire now, and when we act, we create our own reality. And while you &#39;re studying that reality—judiciously, as you will—we&#39;ll act again, creating other new realities, which you can study too, and that&#39;s how things will sort out. We&#39;re history&#39;s actors...and you, all of you, will be left to just study what we do&#39;.</p>

<p>you suspect my intentions because I&#39;m telling you that most of the &quot;news&quot; you see on TV is not in-fact &quot;news&quot; but is actually scripted and planned well in advance?</p>

<p>you whine about me getting hung up on small details</p>

<p>the same &quot;small&quot; details that are used to convict criminals in court every week?</p>

<p>if anything is suspicious, it is the ignoring of inconvenient facts that can&#39;t be explained away without contradicting the official story </p>

<p>i suspect the reason people get called shills is because they behave like shills</p>

<p>we have all read the Gentleperson&#39;s Guide to Forum Spies. we all know how COINTELPRO works</p>

<p><a href="https://cryptome.org/2012/07/gent-forum-spies.htm">https://cryptome.org/2012/07/gent-forum-spies.htm</a></p>

<p>now if you want to be technically correct, its hard to distinguish an actual shill from a useful idiot </p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Useful_idiot">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Useful_idiot</a></p>

<p>of course this creates a conflict because i prefer not to assume people are stupid, but the alternative is that they are a shill. </p>

<p>but then again, its hard to believe that some people can be so stupid as to how they process facts, data, evidence, etc that you almost have to assume they are just pretending to be stupid. again, the alternative is shill </p>

<p>more often than not on small details of specific events that, in the grand scheme, are irrelevant.</p>

<p>did you just make this up, or did you plagiarize it from some other idiot?</p>

<p>um, pretty much everyone on this sub knows that Sandy Hook and Boston Marathon Bombing were hoaxes. </p>

<p>im a shill, for poking holes in the official story?</p>

<p>you have a very vivid imagination, but unfortunately your arguments do not add up </p>

<p>no, the conspiracy theory is that they were crisis actors from the get go, not people brought in after the fact to hide something. </p>

<p>Good actors go to Hollywood. Mediocre actors become crisis actors. if these crisis actors had any real acting talent, they would be on Broadway or Hollywood, not pretending to be grieving parents at a fake shooting </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You dont need to be a talented actor to be a what you call a &quot;crisis actor&quot;. As I said even a mediocre actor can do that. Its the fundamental of his job. Furthermore the assumption that all good actors end up in broadway or hollywood is ridiculous. There are a shit ton of actors.</p>

<p>It just makes no sense that this conspiracy theory revolves around some huge cover-up that if real, needed several hundreads of thousands if not million bucks. But then of course they are gonna pick the one actor that cannot stop smiling. </p>

<p>Its not about having too much money. Its about either believing this is a full-scale conspiracy but then you also got to give them some credit. It just makes no sense to believe they undergo this huge operation but then fail at the easy step. After all this isnt just failing at his job. This would ne straightout not doing his job. Not doing the preparation in any kind. Furthermore also this press conference would be organized. Dont you think there would be an organizer to tell him: htey get in persona?</p>

<p>Again you just give nobody else credit, but somehow think you are more educated on this stuff. Thousands of people have come into contact with this subject. Thousands of educated people who really know about this stuff and are obsessed with it. Yet you, who for sure has no educational background in this, are the one that uncovers this with some of the most basic law of physics. </p>

<p>You cant think people are supermind, orchestrating conspiracies in plain field but then fail at the basics.</p>

<p>you don&#39;t realize how it works, because you are dumb, and you are dumb by design. your education is designed to turn you into a complete idiot</p>

<p>the mental gymnastics you must go thru to keep this all straight in your mind must be olympics worthy </p>

<p>lets see:</p>

<p>&quot;its too big of a conspiracy! someone would talk!&quot;</p>

<p>and then presents to the world his un-supported opinion as if it was fact, and expects everyone else to follow along and agree that its too big of a conspiracy and that someone would talk, and so therefore the human trafficking sting must just be another wild-eyed conspiracy theory, and why is this nonsense on my TV?</p>

<p>nobody is born believing that men walked on the moon</p>

<p>people have to be fooled into believing it</p>

<p>you seem to have this persistent delusion that you are in a majority of people who believe that men have walked on the moon, but i assure you, you are in a rapidly shrinking minority. the kids today have smart phones, and they can watch a youtube video like this one, which has been seen 1 million times </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xciCJfbTvE4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xciCJfbTvE4</a> </p>

<p>the kids can watch the lunar lander launch on youtube and discuss how un-convincing the special effects are </p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/BMBcLg0DkLA?t=21s">https://youtu.be/BMBcLg0DkLA?t=21s</a></p>

<p>im not making this up, this actually happened to me at school</p>

<p>7th grade, Mr Brown&#39;s class. we are studying science? social studies? or whatever </p>

<p>and we are learning about the Bushmen of the Kalahari Desert, a tribe of ancient hunter gathers who exist to this very day, by living like savages and eating ostrich eggs as snacks. </p>

<p>the tone of the lesson seems to have been that white people were advanced and civilized, and black people were ignorant, illiterate savages who live in mud huts and wear loin cloths to work ...  </p>

<p>and then later the moon landing myth comes up ...</p>

<p>and Mr Brown told us, and i quote &quot;some ignorant African&#39;s think that the moon landing is a hoax&quot;</p>

<p>what would you say to Mr Brown if he told your kids that?</p>

<p>so, just to summarize thus far</p>

<p>you are NOT in a majority of people who believe that men have walked on the moon. the vast majority of people have never believed this absurd myth. it is only a small handful of people who have been fooled into believing this myth in the last 50 years. </p>

<p>compare this to the Jesus myth which has been believed by Billions of people over thousands of years </p>

<p>are you the genius for figuring out that Jesus is a myth? I&#39;m sure you tell yourself that </p>

<p>I dont know the evidence they had, I just commented on the video that you presented as your evidence, which certainly isnt that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>IS there a conspiracy theory you dont believe?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>i don&#39;t believe that 19 radical muslim hijackers lead by Osama bin Laden successfully attacked the WTC and the Pentagon on 9/11</p>

<p>thats one of the most absurd conspiracy theories I&#39;ve ever heard. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>no need for tears,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>show me the real tears shed for sandy hook </p>

<blockquote>
<p>So they are stupid dorks, yet got to enough power and money to orchestrate such things. Does that seem plausible to you?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>stupid is as stupid does</p>

<p>these people may have a high IQ, but they do stupid things like fake the news.</p>

<p>they may have seemed clever when they were actually getting away with it years ago</p>

<p>but they are not so clever in todays age of instant communication.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>You just imagined that this is an actor and are defending this like it is an obvious fact.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>actually, it was the other way around. i began by &quot;imagining&quot; that this man was a grieving father who lost his child in a mass shooting, mostly because thats what the media wanted me to imagine. </p>

<p>but then later it become obvious that this was just another active shooter drill, like those that happen every week in schools across America</p>

<p>so when you figure out that nobody died at sandy hook, </p>

<p>that the supposed &quot;kids&quot; who were killed were actually just photographed years prior to the event and allowed to grow into a different looking kid, usually presented to the public as an older sibling, such as those who were presented at the Super Bowl</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Or did they just convince a bunch of randoms in the same area to do that?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>yes, an inexplicably high number of these &quot;families&quot; moved to the area in the years preceding the incident, and many have left the area since then. many of them had closing on their house on the same day. the people were brought in to do the job </p>

<p>the thing that you really need to understand is that you will never figure out Sandy Hook, because its so far in the past and too much of the evidence has disappeared </p>

<p>but the good news is, that the next time they stage a mass shooting, you will automatically know its a fake news event, and proceed to scrutinize the evidence much more closely than you ever have before</p>

<p>you seem to have this persistent delusion that you are in a majority of people who believe that men have walked on the moon, but i assure you, you are in a rapidly shrinking minority. the kids today have smart phones, and they can watch a youtube video like this one, which has been seen 1 million times </p>
</blockquote>

<p>That an opinion that you turn into a fact? what you accused of me? </p>

<p>Why do you think the comments and the likes are turned off on the video? because all of the 1.5 M liked the video or agree with it?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>you are NOT in a majority of people who believe that men have walked on the moon. the vast majority of people have never believed this absurd myth. it is only a small handful of people who have been fooled into believing this myth in the last 50 years. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>opinion turned into fact, purely by the force of your mind.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>compare this to the Jesus myth which has been believed by Billions of people over thousands of years </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Compare religion to an actual occurence? Also thousands of years is  a strange way to put it for a figure that lived 2000 years ago.</p>

<p>However you dispute the simply fact that people actually <em>can</em> get to the moon. You do so by using basic physics. So why do you get it, yet thousands (more than 2000) of people who study that shit dont come to the same conclusion? Are they all retards and you the golden exception? </p>

<p>Or are they just more knowledgable and you talk out of your ass?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>enough that they have a word for it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I asked you how many of them you see IN a movie.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>your argument that actors are perfect because they are paid well is contradicted by this study </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I didnt say they are perfect. Why do you say so mindless things? I say staying in character is one of the basics. More so if it is &quot;live&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>why isn&#39;t is &quot;ridiculous to call it evidence&quot; when you cite this exact same video as &quot;evidence&quot; that a man&#39;s child died at Sandy Hook?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>when did I cite that as evidence? Why do you have a hard-on for putting words in my mouth? Cant you just attack my arguments without either a) talk about some other random bullshit; b) make up stuff that I never said.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>but when i actually looked at the evidence, i had to admit i was wrong, and admit i had been fooled, and admit that my media and government has been behaving badly, using staged, scripted, fake news, propaganda to push an agenda of shifting public opinion on certain topics like gun control or foreign policy </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then why dont you take said evidence and go ahead to sue people? or are all courts of the US in on this?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>why has this been normalized to you? you pretend that its an every day occurrence that someone walks into a school and kills 20 kids, but its actually unprecedented </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Its not an everyday occurence, but its certainly not the first time that some psycho runs wild. Also not in a school. No clue about the exact death number, maybe thats really unprecedented. Its a rare occurrence for sure, but to say it again so you dont put words in my mouth <strong>its not unheard of</strong>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>i don&#39;t believe that 19 radical muslim hijackers lead by Osama bin Laden successfully attacked the WTC and the Pentagon on 9/11</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why do you act now like that is the conspiracy theory? You know exactly what my question is aimed at. Is there any conspiracy theory that stayed a theory for years and years, only supported by some crazyheads that you do <strong>not</strong> believe? Or are all of them true?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>stupid is as stupid does
these people may have a high IQ, but they do stupid things like fake the news.
they may have seemed clever when they were actually getting away with it years ago
but they are not so clever in todays age of instant communication. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Are they clever now or are they not? And how does instant communication plays into this?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>yes, an inexplicably high number of these &quot;families&quot; moved to the area in the years preceding the incident, and many have left the area since then. many of them had closing on their house on the same day. the people were brought in to do the job </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So they cut all their ties? I mean their families must have saw them. Or friends or whatever.</p>

<p>So this clever, stupid dorks (sorry I am getting confused signals if they are smart now or not) hired a shit ton of people, whom they all had to pay. All <strong>huge</strong> liabilities, since any of them could speak up. Or any of their families. But they go along with the plan, paying each and everyone of them lets say... 100k bucks. Not only them: also police officers, the ones who would need to fake documents and what not. Several millions. </p>

<p>The motive is still unclear. Just <em>making people dumber</em>. Not sure how but lets ignore that for a moment. You see: a whole lot of effort that takes a shitload of money, risks and persons. </p>

<p>Why not pay one single crazy man to really do it? To go around a school and shoot up some kids and teachers? Then let him escape and accuse the guy that they accused anyway and is innocent according to you. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>but the good news is, that the next time they stage a mass shooting, you will automatically know its a fake news event, and proceed to scrutinize the evidence much more closely than you ever have before</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Were all mass shootings fake news?</p>

<p>Interesting. So I am the Judge of this case? And my opinion decides his fate? Never knew I had such power. Either which way, I never said I think Adam Lanza is guilty. Like I <em>actually</em> said, I just don&#39;t give a fuck. I don&#39;t exactly go around telling people he&#39;s a child murderer and I don&#39;t really think about it.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Also that whole example was a clear false equivalency. I do see the point you&#39;re making, and it&#39;s valid, but let&#39;s not pretend these two situations are equivalent. Adam Lanza&#39;s presumed guilt has an FBI investigation behind it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How do you not see the inherent fallacy and farcical nature of your supposed attempt at an argument here?</p>

<p>Here&#39;s me, doing what you are doing:</p>

<p>I think you did it. I think you went into Sandy Hook, and shot up a bunch of kids. That&#39;s what i believe. It doesn&#39;t matter why i believe it, and i don&#39;t need to provide you a single shred of reasoning or evidence. So how, and with what evidence, can you change my belief that you alone are responsible? I bet you&#39;ll just tell me you were somewhere else that day. And i&#39;m supposed to believe that? From some post on reddit? Pffff please you&#39;re so dumb (ad hominem argument X1000 etc etc).</p>

<p>I don&#39;t need to provide any reasons or evidence as to why i know for certain that you did it, and since I choose not to believe any other explanation, then case closed. You did it.</p>

<p>Honestly, you are the absolute shining example of what is wrong with this community and it&#39;s severe lack of analytical and critical thinking. I guess you never took a debate class in school.</p>

<p>We are here. We are open minded. You are telling us/others something that doesn&#39;t align with what we believe. It&#39;s up to you to provide a compelling argument and evidence to change our minds. Yet you refuse. This is a red flag. You can&#39;t argue against the official story simply by saying &#39;how dare you believe the official story&#39;.</p>

<p>Frankly, and i&#39;m no longer being cheeky or sardonic here, i honestly believe that this is a specific tactic to discredit this entire community. By posting extraordinary claims/hypothesis&#39; and refusing to provide the tiniest amount of reasons for doing so. So often the simplest explanation is the correct one, and it seems to me that the simplest explanation for this is to come on here, post nonsense, and then continue on refusing to argue your supposed theory/hypothesis with anything other than ad hominem bullshit.</p>

<p>Then, when others come around and see how fucking insane this is, they just assume that everyone here is equally batshit. Thus, in one fell swoop, discrediting every single argument/theory/hypothesis anyone proposes here.</p>

<p>Now all &#39;conspiracy posters&#39; are just loons. </p>

<p>It&#39;s because of cointelpro ops like this that the majority of people presented with questions about the legitimacy of things like the official story of 9/11 not necessarily adding up immediately reject it, and assume that someone asking questions about 9/11 also believes the earth is flat, the queen is a lizard, and Alex Jones is Bill Hicks.</p>

<p>So either you&#39;re cointelpro, and this is a deliberate op to discredit (which is an extremely common tactic and has been for quite some time) or you&#39;re just a complete fucking moron.</p>

<p>Either way though, it doesn&#39;t matter because YOU DID SANDY HOOK.</p>

<p>Define &quot;evidence.&quot; Because it is certainly worth nothing. The complicated/implausible logistics of pulling something like this off certainly <em>does</em> cast doubt on your claims of a hoax. You can&#39;t just whisk it a way with a flick of your magic denial wand.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t see how that would be proof. I really don&#39;t. What does this suggest? Does it suggest that the children didn&#39;t actually die and they&#39;re still completely alive and well? So why haven&#39;t any of the many hundreds of relatives/acquaintances come out and said the kids are still alive? And even if I produced one, how does that prove anything at all? Writing fake obituaries would be one of the easier portions of this so-called &quot;hoax.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People&#39;s minds changed. People rely on the government for protection out of fear more, quicker to relinquish their freedoms. Many copy-cats have happened since. Schools have massively changed their policies and become locked down security theater. Some have dumped lots of money on security industry products, training, and other services. Schools are head over heals to directly partner with and be direct by police now, even in the face of reason. Teachers and principals are more often armed now. Everyone is uptight and afraid and willing to give up all freedom.</p>

<p>They started by inducing fear at the movies...a shooter at the dark knight midnight showing?  my kids went to see that!</p>

<p>that didnt work.</p>

<p>so they tried to get the lgbt community on board by shooting up a gay club.</p>

<p>that didnt work.</p>

<p>so they pulled the big guns and went after actual children.</p>

<p>that didnt even work.</p>

<p>we havent had a large scale mass shooting since....we did have vegas but until more info comes out I will not count it.  Especially since that looks to be an arms deal gone wrong rather than a planned attack on gun rights</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I got kicked out of a friend&#39;s house when I admitted I didn&#39;t believe Sandy Hook as we&#39;re told it. I was out of town and a guest at their house, and they did let me back in, but it was kind of scary, the guy was shaking and really agitated and looked like he might want to hurt me.</p>

<p>I ended up showing him the Super Bowl video and taking it face by face and comparing it to the photos of the dead children. That made him even more angry but he started asking questions, going &quot;WHY WOULD SOMEONE SET THIS UP?&quot; and I just said I didn&#39;t know why, and I told him that I had believed it and was also extremely upset and scared when I started to realize it wasn&#39;t real. </p>

<p>So then I showed him Gene Rosen, Robby Parker, the McDonnell&#39;s interview with Anderson Cooper, and teacher Kaitlyn Roig&#39;s interview--specifically pointing out that no actual tears are cried.</p>

<p>He was pissed off but I think he actually believed me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right, I generally dismiss that sort of thing myself. A lot of people look like a lot of people in the world. But there&#39;s at least 7 people involved in Sandy Hook who are supposed to be dead yet look eerily similar to the children at the Super Bowl choir, and the fact that the Soto and Phelp&#39;s families have such striking resemblance to the Greenberg/Sexton family photo album.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s isn&#39;t just two people who look similar. It a dozen people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If Sandy Hook was a false flag, why is the assumption that nobody died in that conspiracy? </p>

<p>For TPTB to encompass all the occulted practices and string pulling assumed of them, but they stop short of mass murdering children and create an elaborate hoax instead, feels like mental gymnastics to allow the TPTB to be corrupt enough to fake killing children, but never actually do it (in the public eye at least).  It feels like this line of logic let’s the conspiracy theorist follow the narrative without having to confront actual dead children. </p>

<p>Historical false flags have let civilians die repeatedly, why would this be any different?</p>

<p>That&#39;s a good question, we all have that question. Why won&#39;t they show Adam dead, or his autopsy? Because it didn&#39;t happen, and Adam was not a real person.</p>

<p>I knew that one was coming. I hear that trite response every fucking time, it&#39;s annoying and empty. People should have right to crime scene photos, and in most places, they do. It&#39;s freedom of information. You don&#39;t like it, so what. What right do you have to judge how a person learns or comes to accept something that happened and prevent them from it?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The government doesn&#39;t bend over to your twisted whims of wanting pics of dead people.</p>

<p>THERE IT IS! Like clock work, the insult because I want the government to be held accountable to me and I want all the details of crimes committed. Crime does not have a right to be hidden from the public. BUT now all of a sudden I&#39;m &quot;twisted&quot; because I want to see the dead bodies. I&#39;ve heard it all; sick, fucked up, disgusting, deranged, and on and on just because I have a morbid curiosity. What right do you have to judge a person&#39;s morbid curiosity? You don&#39;t. What right does the government have to not bend to my whims? They don&#39;t, but our society has exalted them to make people like yourself think that we are servants to them, when in fact they are servants to us.</p>

<p>Yes, yes you do.  Why do the families have to suffer because you want to see these pictures?  Did you take them with your camera?  If not, you don&#39;t own the pictures.  Also, I&#39;m free to judge you all I want, just as you&#39;ve judged others as well.  I can&#39;t induce any punishments because that would be wrong, but I can personally judge you all I want.

<p>Arrest records and indictments are public records, forever, whether guilt or innocence is determined.  Clearly the public ethos feels knowing that a mere possibility of a crime occurring is more important than the accused’s reputation.  Why should the evidence of actual crimes be relatively devalued?  What possibly damage can the victim of a crime sustain by showing the public irrefutable proof of her victimhood?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What does society gain by giving you access to these pictures?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>His assent to the veracity of the crime, which entails his approbation of the rule of law.  That answer is obvious.  A compliant, faithful citizen is more valuable than a dissenter.  And I’m not even a conspiracy theorist.</p>

<p>The problem is, I think there are fewer people who actually really believe it happened and get incensed over someone questioning the narrative.

Just notice the pattern of those who refute it, they always call people names, every time.

<p>They may be similar but there aren&#39;t the same. Accuracy is important.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>. and its not a photo but a 20 min video</p>

<p>Great. 20 full minutes of video. And in it you&#39;ll see an officer being an officer, which means not every officer does their job exactly perfectly every single waking minute.</p>

<p>But I imagine only statists perceive the armed wing of the state to be infallible.</p>
