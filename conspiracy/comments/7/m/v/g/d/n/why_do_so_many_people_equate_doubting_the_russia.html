        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>For example, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7mv8r8/aclu_lawsuit_seeks_to_force_disclosure_of_trump/">the ACLU</a> just filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration to force it to reveal the updated rules for the infamous &quot;kill list&quot;.</p>

<p>The extrajudicial assassinations that occurred under the Obama administration set an extremely dangerous precedent, and IMO it&#39;s one of the worst policies in the history of the US.</p>

<p>Trump&#39;s foreign policy appears to be more of same, especially with regards to allowing the alphabet agencies/military industrial complex to continue their crimes against humanity.</p>

<p>Yet instead of the public demanding transparency over who the government can assassinate without due process, TPTB have successfully dangled the Russia collusion conspiracy theory to occupy the masses.</p>

<p>Trump is truly the perfect useful idiot for this, as TPTB are being wildly successful in their divide and conquer strategy, with Trump and Russia being their ace in the hole.</p>

<p>This manufactured outrage conveniently has completely preoccupied the population and is preventing us from calling out the current admin for being more of the same: figureheads for the military industrial complex and the Deep State.</p>

<p>The &quot;Trump vs Deep State&quot; meme is part of this narrative, I believe, as they&#39;ve reduced us to paranoid bickering instead of us uniting and focusing our sights on TPTB.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve never used this term unironically before, but I really wish the sheeple would just wake up...</p>

The United States is supposed to be a &#39;complex republic&#39;, meaning there are overlapping power controls, like the three sections, that were supposed to help keep from one party completely taking over. Guess we&#39;ll have to amend it a bit, so two parties pretending as one can&#39;t do it either. Maybe a five party minimum? And insist several of the leadership are grassroots? lol Wishful dreaming.</p>

<p>Inflation, for example, is a form of theft.</p>

<p>I have this quote printed out on my desk:
&#39;I believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies. If the American people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency, first by inflation, then by deflation, the banks and corporations that will grow up around the banks will deprive the people of all property until their children wake-up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered. The issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people, to whom it properly belongs.&#39; -Thomas Jefferson(not a perfect guy but he got this one right)</p>

<p>Our whole lives are based on a lie. Like we&#39;re in a science fiction movie and everybody keeps pretending it&#39;s a musical or something. 1984 the musical: Idiocracy part 2.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I somewhat agree, <a href="/u/eggwhiteboy">/u/eggwhiteboy</a>. Although, there is a decent amount of crossover(rich individuals truly controlling nation states, dictators, etc.) with SA as the shining example not to even get into who controls the Central Banks of the VAST MAJORITY of the nations across the earth via [&quot;The Bank of Int&#39;l Settlements&quot;](bis.org) which is located in a &quot;no man&#39;s land&quot;, similar to the Vatican(kinda anyway), and it is beholden to no earthly laws as it is under no jurisdiction including the ICC. I assume we are all aware who runs the central banks, yes?</p>

<p>.</p>

<p>.</p>

<p>In additional regards to OP&#39;s question: It&#39;s the same reason someone couldn&#39;t possibly despise Obama&#39;s policies, ideals, etc. w/o being &quot;RAYCISSSSS!!!&quot;.</p>

<p>The same reason someone couldn&#39;t despise the most blatantly corrupt Presidential candidate I have ever conceived of in HRC w/o being a &quot;Misogynist&quot;, deplorable human being.</p>

<p>It is because identity politics have been weaponized by the establishment, mainly by those on the political-left and the MSM is quite simply the propaganda arm of the DNC/Deep State/CIA &amp; FBI.</p>

<p>Honestly, one cannot watch a SINGLE POLITICAL DISCUSSION(with &quot;both sides&quot; represented) any longer without the person arguing for the &quot;(D)&quot; PoV bringing up racism, misogyny, and/or Homophobia etc., etc.. </p>

<p>IT TRULY IS CRAZY AS IT HAS BEEN DAYS SINCE I HAVE SEEN A POLITICAL CONVERSATION BETWEEN A &quot;(R)&quot; and a &quot;(D)&quot; W/O THE LATTER BRINGING ID POLITICS INTO IT!! IT IS INSANE!! </p>

<p>They truly do not even bother with anything logical or policy specific any longer or, at the VERY LEAST, this is the case 9/10 times. Discourse is essentially off the table with them and it will eventually stop working, like it has for the most part w/President Trump, and truly IDK what the left will do once &quot;racism, misogyny, and/or Homophobia etc., etc.- Fatigue&quot; fully sets in dor the majority of the voting population in this country.</p>

With Russiagate, they had a pre-determiend conclusion that Russia had interfered (how else could Hillary have lost lol) and have been searching for any evidence to support this claim. First they claimed they hacked the voting machines, which turned out not to be the case. Then it was the piss tape dossier, which also proved to be completely phony. Then it was the emails, that apparently Russia hacked into. No real evidence because the DNC refused the FBI access to the servers. Then it was just general collusion for which there has been no evidence of at all. The fact they have tried to make all these different allegations stick to me just says the entire thing is bullshit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure Trump is a useful idiot. I&#39;ve been beginning to think about our current situation in a new light. Constant drama and distraction. Always something to keep people talking. It reminds me of when Survivor premiered back in the day. It seemed like everyone was watching, discussing and debating. Reality TV. Trump. One could argue that he was the King of Reality TV with the apprentice. I think he has brought his &#39;High-Ratings&#39; reality tv strategies into the political spectrum. He is showing just how effective it can be. It explains his constant need to insert new dramatic events into everything. The American public is being entertained. Sure, it feels like many of us are more engaged in political theatre, but are we really engaged on important matters? Survivor was able to convince millions of people that they not only could watch TV and be entertained, but that we could also play a role in determining the outcomes.</p>

<p>Are you not entertained? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I refer to the Obama presidency as the Soma for the Left years. As in the drug to keep society peaceful and happy in Aldous Huxley&#39;s novels Brave New World and Island.</p>

<p>Illegal wars. Free trade agreements. Banker bailouts. Neocon globalization plans. Creating a surveillance-state. Patriot Acts. Support for Israel. Expansion of US based oil exploration.</p>

<p>These were all things the Left was actively in the streets protesting against during GW&#39;s presidency.</p>

<p>Obama did all those crimes <em>exponentially more</em> and there was literally no protests against him or his policies.</p>

<p>We were given the Soma. A smooth talking black President. Gay marriage. Marijuana legalization. A compliant, reassuring MSM. Some fake, ineffective, feels-good climate-change rhetoric.</p>

<p>Now They<sup><sup>TM</sup></sup> give us a Trump presidency and the Left is in full-on, maniacal Soma withdrawal. Having lost all sense of logic, rationalization, or critical thought.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The biggest side effect of putting Trump in the White House is an increase in the number of people who now trust and defend the intelligence agencies. NSA, CIA, and FBI. That&#39;s because these agencies all claim Trump colluded with Russia. There are a lot of people out there who seem to be conditioned to believe the opposite of every single Policy and belief of the Trump Administration. The best example is the TPP. Prior to Trump, the Reddit hive mind was very anti TPP. Now they support it because Trump was against it. </p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if Trump&#39;s entire candidacy and presidency was a conspiracy between the intelligence agencies and the Militray Industrial Complex. Either that or he&#39;s just being used by them, with a fake collusion narrative and the majority of the media in on it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are plenty of far left and communists like myself who doubt the Russian collusion narrative because we look at the whole situation based on evidence and through a different framework of understanding. The American &quot;liberal&quot; Left is not the real left and only legitimizes the real opposition in your country, the communists and socialists who want to remove power from the capitalists and re-empower the working class. The far left has been conflated with the far right as historically similar expressions of fascism, although this couldn&#39;t be further from the truth. </p>

<p>The Russian collusion narrative is part of a larger third wave &quot;red scare&quot; whose principal aim is to intimidate and silence radical dissenting voices. The entire scare is Ukrainian fascism repackaged for an American audience and delivered by the corporate media. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Na. They ban people who post to <a href="/r/topmindsofreddit">/r/topmindsofreddit</a> for example, which is a great attempt at keeping the trolls at bay. That sub exists to troll this sub, so a lot of them will complain about getting banned. </p>

<p>Here is a post I found on one of the moderator&#39;s accounts:</p>

<p>&quot;Donald Trump supposedly told House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) he supports cutting Social Security but will not admit it publicly because it would hurt his election chances. He openly says he will lie to the people about it because he knows that the people are against it.&quot; 1,250 points, 75 percent upvoted: <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/4lk9xd/donald_trump_supposedly_told_house_speaker_paul/">https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/4lk9xd/donald_trump_supposedly_told_house_speaker_paul/</a></p>

<p>You can&#39;t claim they are all pro Trump. Another mod submitted this post, which is anti-Trump, and yet another moderator chimed in on the current top discussion in this thread to agree, so that&#39;s three anti-Trump moderators from a quick glance. Flytape was pro-Trump, but he&#39;s since been removed. I think the main pro-Trump mod being removed, plus a quick glance showing 3 anti-Trump mods, probably more, debunks your claim. At worst, the moderators disagree about Trump, and it should be that way.</p>

<p>If you check the comments of supposedly &quot;pro-Trump&quot; posts, anti-Trump comments reign supreme. There&#39;s nothing really wrong with that, but the people claiming this sub is one giant pro-Trump conspiracy are deluding themselves. Some people try to claim all of this is explained because this or that post hit <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a>, but that&#39;s complete bullshit. Posts that don&#39;t hit <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> are also very anti-Trump in the comments. Anti-Trump posts also couldn&#39;t hit <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> in the first place if they weren&#39;t heavily upvoted in this sub before they reached <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a>. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Did you see the percentage of upvotes for each link above? What does that suggest to you? </p>

<p>Here&#39;s the problem: When you see anti CNN posts, anti DNC posts, anti-Clinton posts, and anything similar, you have 3 or 4 different groups of people who will upvote those and only 1 group who would downvote.</p>

<p>The upvoters: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>The Bernie Sanders crowd. The majority of them hate Clinton and the DNC because they screwed over Bernie in the primaries.</p></li>
<li><p>Independents. These people hate Dems and Reps. Many of them think they are two sides of the same coin. Upvote anti DNC post? sure, why not?</p></li>
<li><p>3rd party people. There is some overlap with the independents, so this is not an entirely separate category. They might support Jill Stein, Gary Johnson, etc. </p></li>
<li><p>Ron Paul supporters, Trey Gowdy supporters, etc. </p></li>
<li><p>Trump supporters</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The Downvoters: </p>

<ul>
<li>Clinton supporters. </li>
</ul>

<p>You can&#39;t pretend that an anti-Clinton post was upvoted only by Trump supporters. Remember how I mentioned the upvote percentage in the first sentence? Who do you think would upvote anti-Trump posts? All of these groups except Trump supporters. There really aren&#39;t a lot of people in here who support Trump or Clinton. The majority believe we were handed the two shittiest candidates in history this past election. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good work!    Yet to me the propaganda still does make sense,  because it is immobilizing any direct action within the general population,  it is basically a gaslighting operation that either turns people into haters.   Hating Trump,  hating Russia.    Perhaps Russia would rather not be hated,  but Trump seems to thrive on it.   And outside of perhaps a mild uproar over net neutrality,  which was conducted as comedy,  the population is totally demobilized on energy policy,  drug policy,  immigration,  and foreign policy,  on every important metric,  the corporations are making their calls unopposed.    That&#39;s not a position of failure or weakness,  and its not by accident.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you are saying Trump shills post both pro and anti Trump submissions to distract the public so that corporations that benefit from Trump&#39;s actions can continue to pillage while everyone is distracted? Now <em>that</em> was an interesting attempt to rationalize away all of the anti Trump submissions I cited. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not the same individuals most of the time.   The pro and anti Trump posts are one set of combatents,  and the there is another battle ground for the anti-Russian propaganda.    Its like a Venn Diagram,  where a lot of the anti-Russia people also happen to be anti-Trump people,   but the point I am trying to make is that neither arguement has all that much substance.</p>

<p>Just a few years ago there was a lot of Rumsfeld/Cheney/Bush hate on the one side,  and a lot of extreme paranoia about a religious fundamentalist Muslim faction.   Muslim haters were fighting Bush haters,  remember that?   It worked out the same way then,  perhaps even more effectively,   because that trajectory lasted into Libya and Syria regardless of a change in the White House,  effectively we had four presidential terms of successful misdirection,  now forgotten as if it never happened.    No investigation of funding ISIS or even al Qaeda is even contemplated.</p>

<p>The Russia thing will blow over,   China will be the bigger issue.   Trump will be a useful hate object for as long as that works,   but if that goes away,   I am sure Pence can find a way to be controversial.    But the main thing is the two parties will propose another platform to kick the can down the road in Wall Streets favor by 2020.    </p>

<p>There have been cases in the past where the population focused its hate on something that was a real threat to the continuity of the status quo.    Police force had to be used against the population in the past,  and the rulers are prepared to do that again,  but isn&#39;t this way more effective and less trouble?</p>

<p>To tell you the truth,   I think that the regular instances of senseless public killings are also part of the plan.    People are getting conditioned by that as well,  not to trust each other,  to worry about another kook.    Any kind of violent resistance against the current status quo is going to meet with public rage.   The people are ok if the military does it to others overseas,   but will not support anything like that here at home.    Those who resist the status quo are marginalized.    I would say that is working pretty well.</p>

<p>Probably not too much of that going on,  especially right here on this post.    On the other hand,   it has been pretty well documented to have happened.    But that&#39;s not what I meant in my conversations here.    What I meant in my conversations here is that these kind of arguments are welcome and encouraged.    Its the kind of thing they would like us to argue about.    Its not our own agenda,  its been handed to us,  and we have been groomed for it.</p>

<p>This sub probably did have more of its share of Trump supporters at one point.   A Jones,   Michael Rivero and a lot of other popular mentors for some conspiracy buffs hated Hillary so much that they were drooling for Trump for the duration of the election and even much of this year.    Many of them have cooled off,   but not all.    Don&#39;t you think?</p>

<p>I&#39;d stand by my position, but honestly, I&#39;ve written (and talked) so much about this already (not on reddit), that I just don&#39;t have the energy right now. </p>

<p>Just being honest. </p>

<p>Yes, many who support Trump don&#39;t buy the Russia Collusion narrative, and the opposite is true for anti-Trumpers. </p>

<p>The trick is to look at all the evidence objectively, which isn&#39;t easy to do. I&#39;ve done my best to do so, and from what I&#39;ve seen, this whole thing was concocted to explain why the outcome (of the election) was the opposite of the expectation.</p>

<p>Cognitive dissonance is a helluva&#39; thing. So is projecting an external locus of control.</p>

<p>Combine the two and you get, &quot;the Russians did it&quot;.</p>

<p>I&#39;m a partisan hack for responding with facts to someone who claims $1.5Million per indictment is apparently expensive and then goes on to claim ignorance as it pertains to Benghazi, a literal waste of time and money that led to <strong>ZERO</strong> indictments? Only one of us was being partisan in that discussion. The other relied on facts to back up his argument.</p>

<p>Why do so many people equate doubting the Russia collusion narrative with support for Trump? It&#39;s entirely possible (and prudent) to be skeptical of both the narrative <em>and</em> the POTUS.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s not a mystery, it&#39;s a simple logic: Other subreddits which &#39;doubt&#39; or promote the &#39;no collusion&#39; narrative are heavily pro-Trump, namely T_D, Conservative, and almost all right-leaning MSM sources. While the motives may be different in your case for &#39;doubting&#39;, the simple logical step is those who doubt must support the other side, a black and white issue. Pro or Con.</p>

<p>While I think there was indeed collusion or at least forms of cooperation between the Trump Campaign and the Kremlin (in the form of information gathering/sharing, money laundering mostly through property and dirty loans, etc.), MSM and TPTB are definitely inflating and sensationalizing any little detail.

<p>Yes, I agree with this. I think the problem with a lot of people is black/white thinking. </p>

<p>Russia is evil, the US is good / The US is evil, Russia is good. </p>

<p>There are interests of self-preservation by the leadership of both countries. But the trick is that if you asked the majority of people, they don&#39;t really have the same interests as their leaders. The only reason these people are their leaders is because of their own apathy, because of inertia and ignorance.</p>

<p>The wars go on and on, the conflicts rise and fall, ad infinitum. Those in power are the chess players and use everyone as their chess pieces. The problem with everyone is that they allow themselves to be used as chess pieces.</p>

<p>Deep down, I doubt people want war, conflict between nations, be it military or even economical. Americans don&#39;t hate Russians. I&#39;m sure if you put a bunch of them in a room together they&#39;d have a blast, as long as politics wasn&#39;t on the menu. Neither do Russians hate Americans.</p>

<p>But the media will tell you that the Russians are evil, that they are destroying the US, that they &quot;installed&quot; Trump (even though ultimately the US voted him in, no matter what propaganda, the US voters made the final decision).</p>

<p>The people have been lulled into an illusion, they&#39;ve been distracted by memes, reality TV and shitty music.  And now here we are. People mistaken for mental labels , instead of actual living beings (Russians! Chinese! Americans! Jews! Mulsims! ... the labels have replaced the human).</p>

<p>That&#39;s not entirely true.  There are plenty of progressive subreddits that don&#39;t buy into this bullshit, either.  I moderate one.  The largest ones got hijacked by the neoliberals who promote the Russia narrative, but there are still tons that have remained independent.  </p>

<p>I mean... how many conspiracy theories do? It’s always circumstantial. How much evidence is there that PG is real? How much evidence is there that the Clintons are criminals?</p>

<p>It works both ways here. You can’t dismiss something and close your mind just because there’s no blaring evidence.</p>

<p>So far there’s Manafort and Flynn. There’s Trump Jr talking to Russians and invoking client-lawyer privilege to avoid answering questions. There’s no tax returns from Trump that may reveal a glimpse of his relationships in Russia. There’s abc agents from different agencies claiming there was suspicious activity.</p>

<p>Maybe it’s a narrative that Trump’s political enemies are pushing to get him out of office or undermine his 2020 run. But it could also be the biggest scandal since Watergate. </p>

<p>I know, because if there were evidence, after all this time investigating, they would have found it. They haven&#39;t, which is why they&#39;re focusing on potential criminal activities which have nothing to do with collusion. Oh, they&#39;ll find lots of financial malfeasance, especially with regards to Manafort, but evidence of collusion? No.</p>

<p>And by the way, the financial shit will ensnare a lot of Democrats as well. So, if this is their strategy to take down Trump, they&#39;re shooting themselves in the foot. In short, they&#39;re stupid.</p>

<p>Nothing I say or do will probably convince you, of course, so I&#39;ll just leave it at that. I could send you hundreds of well-researched pieces debunking this insanity, but you wouldn&#39;t read it or, more importantly, believe it anyway.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t like Trump, didn&#39;t vote for him but have never believed the Trump-Russia nonsense and have gotten in countless arguments about it. I&#39;ve been labelled a Trump supporter because of it countless times and it is unnerving. The masses have one-track minds and are fed and told what to think by the MSM so they just parrot stuff without thinking about it. They can&#39;t grasp that most things aren&#39;t black and white. 2016 and the political campaigns opened up a lot of people&#39;s eyes to the rigged system we have and I for one won&#39;t play that game any more. </p>

<p>Trump is terrible but he&#39;s not always wrong and the other side isn&#39;t any damn better—they were just better at speaking eloquent BS and putting wool over people&#39;s eyes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with most of what you say.  Most people are anti-New World Order globalist, but they are labeled as being pro-Trump.  I believe this is because most people do not understand the true reality of the world we live in.  People see things from the point of view of Democrat versus Republican, but that is a distraction.  Both Democrat and Republicans are New World Order globalists.  McCain, for example, is one, which is why he is against Trump.  </p>

<p>I question how much control the POTUS has over policy.  In an ideal world, the POTUS would be able to do his or her job.  The problem is that the U.S. government has been infiltrated by people with an agenda that does not benefit the American people.  The American people are here to be milked like a cow for money.  </p>

<p>You say &quot;Trump&#39;s foreign policy...&quot;, but how much control does Trump actually have over the U.S. foreign policy?  If the CIA wants to do something in another country, can Trump actually stop them?  Does Trump have the power to control the CIA in reality?  On paper, the CIA answers to the POTUS, but the reality is much different.  </p>

<p>Trump is actually not an idiot.  LOL.  He plays people like a fiddle.  </p>

<p>I will believe the sheeple are woke up when they start bitching about the Federal Reserve.  Same with Trump.  I will know that he is real when he starts going after the Federal Reserve.  Auditing the Pentagon is a good start, and it will take time, but the Federal Reserve needs to be audited and nationalized.  There is no reason in this world why foreigners should own a portion of the Federal Reserve.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>that is actually a very valid point</p>

<p>The problem as I see it is twofold:</p>

<p>1) first, you have to understand the true nature of the political hot war we are in.  It is, worldwide, a war of TPTB vs a small but rapidly rising wave of populism, nationalism, and citizen journalism  - so first things first, do NOT blindly believe ANYTHING you read in the media.</p>

<p>2) TPTB very certainly still has overwhelming tendrils in the US (and global) institutions and governments, it isnt merely the media.  Before blaming Trump when nasty things keep occurring, realize that many things, even MOST things, are and will be kept beyond his reach for as long as TPTB can manage it, and even then he will be fed inaccurate data on purpose to manipulate his decisions.  He is, after all, just one man, even his entire White House is just ONE branch of US government.  So Im not being an apologist for any wrongdoing, but the more the US electorate places MAGA politicians into congress, the more you WILL see MAGA agenda policies enacted (if, in fact you are looking for that, and if your problem is with the deep state invisible control over everything and everyone, then you SHOULD be looking for that).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A number of individuals have already been confirmed to have been communicating with contacts within Russia during the campaign, the most infamous probably being his son.</p>

<p>There is already motive for Trump, as he stands to gain firstly the presidency but also the ability to make himself more money easily through policy changes and tax breaks. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a no-brainer for Russia given the opportunity, as the cold war is proof that they&#39;re already willing to resort to espionage and diversion tactics. </p>

<p>You&#39;re not asking for evidence, you&#39;re asking for absolute proof. It is entirely possible he didn&#39;t, and it&#39;s entirely possible he did. I&#39;m just saying I personally believe it&#39;s much more likely that he did, rather than didn&#39;t. Hillary was corrupt, and probably would have been worse, but don&#39;t take it out of the question for Trump just because you may have voted for him. They are after all, politicians. Power corrupts.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is communicating with people from a foreign country considered collusion for a pres candidate?  I&#39;m curious because I did see that Jake Sullivan email about HRC being contacted about an off record meeting with the Chinese ambassador.  I imagine we&#39;d be going through the same salem witch trial against her had she won?</p>

<p>I&#39;m not asking for proof.  I am literally asking for evidence of collusion,  None has been provided &amp; our overly data intrusive IC has been investigating (and leaking any crumbs to media gleefully) for over a year now.  Your response is super vague and lacking in any substance, you should work for CNN.   Looping Trump Jr in is risky as you dig into the details beyond the meeting and drill down on &quot;contacts&quot; of those who organized it.</p>

<p>Was there evidence that this meeting somehow gave Trump a secret edge to win courtesy of Putin?  Let&#39;s say ok well this guy gave him /offered dirt on HRC.  Right.  So is Chris Steele an american citizen?  No.  He&#39;s a former intel agent of another nation who was paid by political operatives in the US to provide dirt on Trump. What&#39;s the difference?  In fact, it seems worse as there is no definitive connection that the lawyer was connected to the govt or that Clinton was even discussed (see the WAPO 10/9 article - if WAPOs gotta question it, we all must b/c they are DYING for a smoking gun of collusion).</p>

<p>Lastly and MOST importantly I voted for Gary Johnson.  The biggest source of corruption in this country is the strength of the national parties.  Anyone who tells you otherwise is dumb or lying.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When Hillary lost the Dems pivoted on the attack to push the narrative of Russian collusion with the intent to impeach and/or diminish Trump&#39;s support base.</p>

<p>The reason was because they were scared he might actually try to &#39;drain the swamp&#39;. If you look at Russia as a strategic partner it makes a fuck ton of sense when you lay it out:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Russia fights terrorists and can do the dirty work without a major political backlash</p></li>
<li><p>Russia is a major oil producer. pivoting to russian oil would diminish the terrorist power base</p></li>
<li><p>Russia can be a strong ally in dealing with China and North korea, although Russia can never really be trusted, but then again, China can&#39;t be trusted either</p></li>
<li><p>Russia has  a rich and strong scientific tradition. They could be strong partners in the rapidly developing techological industries</p></li>
<li><p>Russians have a lot of money. Their investment in the Us economy would be good for both parties</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Russia is a much better partner than China, or many of the middle eastern countries. Their values are more similar to american values than the middle eastern or Chinese. It would be easier to do.</p>

<p>The jury is out on whether russians actually tampered with the presidential election. If they did, I think it&#39;s important to point out that the US has interfered in the elections of other countries for different reasons dozens of times.</p>

<p>Well, they have gone too far. It has become too obvious.

They have been fed the narrative that Trump = Russia to simplify the propaganda for them, therefore anyone who can see the lies behind the accusation of Russian intervention is a Trump supporter.</p>
