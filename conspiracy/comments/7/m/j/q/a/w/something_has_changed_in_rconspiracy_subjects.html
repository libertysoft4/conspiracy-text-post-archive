<p>If you have any doubt look at the first few pages of r/conspiracy, and check out old stories that have just popped up. Interesting but not as interesting as what is happening in the political spectrum right now. </p>

<p>I think it is time to move on from this sub. Shame, had potential but reeks of something stinky and not in a nice way</p>

<p>EDIT: the new system targets posts BUT posts are not the problem, anything is possible in CONSPIRACY no matter how manic the subject matter sounds. The weakest links are the mods, admin, the trolls and the shills that misdirect and delete that is the problem. So with the new submission declaration, how do I know that the post will go through without someone with nefarious agenda not submit the post, no?</p>

<p>Reddit going full MSM PR mode. They just cant outright do it blantantly so they do it quietly like they did to politics, news, worldnews etc. The highly brigaded threads about Wikileaks etc in the past couple months were test runs. </p>

<p>Here shortly the sub will flip. It will be 90% shareblue over running the organic users with their leftist globalist narrative. It will be just like all the other subs.. (politics, topminds, ama,news,worldnews, technology etc). </p>

<p>Mark my words, its coming. Reddit is the new Dig and Leftist propaganda outlet.</p>

<p>Look at the mods and thenhuge shift the past few months. Thats the new conspiracy no ones talking about. </p>

<p><strong>There seem to be a few types of older accounts:</strong><br/>
Ones that have shitloads of karma they built up on the_donald and/or conspiracy.<br/>
Ones that are old but have very little karma and a wiped or empty post history that woke up to post on that sub.<br/>
Ones that appear to be old gaming accounts that were purchased for use on the_donald, went silent for months before reemerging for this sub. </p>

<p>Yeah, I stay away from the pizzagate stuff now. I think it was pushed the way it was for a reason, with a lot of people coming up with crazy theories related to it on purpose, because now anytime child pedophile networks are brought up, some people automatically link it mentally. &quot;Yeah, just like pizzagate. Where Hillary ran a pedophile network from a pizza place. Sure.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I want to know why have a 20 days old account saying it is time to move on from this sub like you have vested time here. Those of us who have been around for a long time (since 2011) have seen this sub go through many changes and many different coordinated attacks. Your negativity does not help the situation. You say you come for Vatican,an pedogate an such, then make this post which will turn away new comers. How does that help? I may not agree with how the mods have handled things over the past year, but this submission statement thing appears to be good. Now &quot;new&quot; is not clogged up with horseshit stories because redditors from outside the community think it is funny. Mocker is the greatest form of flattery but it is still annoying. </p>

<p>If you are really concerned with what is being deleted I believe the site is called ceddit an it allows you to see what has been deleted. As far as the submission statements i dig em, if you share a conspiracy you should have some of your own thoughts on to why you believe it or desire to share it. </p>

<p>There are plenty of nefarious agendas all over reddit, we are no different. Some of the regulators here are on our side and some are not. Infiltrating &quot;subversive&quot; groups has not and will not stop. It is a double edge sword i guess but you have to trust someone in a world where we trust very few. So as of right now I am trusting the mods have this subs best interests in mind. </p>

<p>An remember, the shills will brigade report shit to their Admin handlers who will come in and remove it without the mods knowledge. </p>

<p>&quot;...no matter how manic the subject matter sounds.&quot;</p>

<p>Whose shit has been taken down simply for being manic? I&#39;ve seen several manic posts get put up recently and stay up because they legitimately related to conspiracy. They&#39;re trying to cut back on spam and bullshit and so far, the consensus seems to be that it&#39;s working.</p>

<p>&quot;So with the new submission declaration, how do I know that the post will go through...&quot; </p>

<p>How did you know it would go through before?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;WHO considers it spam and WHO considers it political bullshit?&quot; </p>

<p>From what I understand, it&#39;s considered spam when a submission comes in via spambot, which would hopefully be evident by said spambot not being able to provide a submission statement. It&#39;s political bullshit if the Op submits a mission statement that can&#39;t justify it being put up under the banner of conspiracy.</p>

<p>&quot;You trust reddit, a corporate company? Ok ...&quot;</p>

<p>I don&#39;t &quot;trust&quot; reddit, or the mods, or the users, or spambots, or trolls, any more than I have too in order to enjoy browsing the site and engaging in conversation.</p>

<p>Can you explain how it&#39;s any easier for mods to cut legit submissions than before there was the new rule? If you can, cool, I&#39;d honestly like to hear about it. Take your time though, I probably won&#39;t even check for a response to this question til morning, honestly it&#39;s just not that big a fucking deal commensurate to the time I&#39;ve spent in this room. Otherwise, relax, go run a couple different searches, read some of the submissions and maybe reassess the conclusion you came to earlier.</p>

<p>Yeah, reddit got co-opted, so they say, and I believe those who know better than I and I kinda see it myself. Oh well, that&#39;s not news, not a surprise and yet it&#39;s still not totally useless to me personally...not yet anyway. Ymmv.</p>

<p>The chaos used to be caused, in part, by the mod philosophy that anything goes as long as it didn&#39;t doxx or break any laws. Very anti-censorship.</p>

<p>Then reddit became a safe space and simultaneously this sub got nice set of rules in the side bar. And shitty mods that ban the word shill like some sort of Orwellian overlords. And now every submission has to be approved by them. </p>

<p>Fuck them, and fuck all these rules. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude, mods are asking for ppl to declare why there submission should be relevant under the conspiracy umbrella. It reduces spam. It also gives Op a chance to justify why a submission should be here and others a chance to read it, so it can&#39;t be taken down as easily, as long as it&#39;s legit. If I&#39;m not mistaken, before the new rule went into effect, mods could take stuff down just by saying it didn&#39;t relate in any meaningful way to conspiracies. You got your shit backwards.</p>

<p>You really think so, do you? From my perspecive this subreddit got swamped with new members which all pushed a few selective stories. There was a <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> before the_donald members started massposting and pushign their agenda and a time after. </p>

<p>And given that most of the pedogate sentiment uses a rethoric already used in other instances and don&#39;t care for the actual problem (reducing the instances where pedophila results in molestation and rape) but only for a vague liberal conspiracy I daresay that you&#39;ve been played... </p>

Most of us joined when this subs content was how alien farts were the actual cause of weather, back when conspiracy was filled with shit about mkultra, 9/11, area 51, and other cool and interesting shit. Vatican abuse isn&#39;t a conspiracy theory anymore. Priests are the butt of many jokes, the Vatican&#39;s efforts to systemically provide a safe haven to it&#39;s members is very well known, and there was an extremely popular and critically acclaimed movie that came out two years ago on the subject called Spotlight that won two Oscars. Pedogate isn&#39;t a conspiracy theory anymore. People are damn well aware of the sexual abuse power structure that exists in Hollywood as well as many other areas of several different industries. It&#39;s a tired subject, with legitimate cases already being covered by the MSM. If you&#39;re conflating that with Pizzagate, then the fact of the matter is that the community is very divisive on Pizzagate because it&#39;s a shitty conspiracy built entirely from poorly glued together speculation. Sure, anything is possible in conspiracy, but people harassed people in real life over a very fanatical and implausible theory that actually had no real evidence whatsoever. The shit gets downvoted because it&#39;s put this sub at a huge risk for being shut down several different times and people who come here for other reasons don&#39;t want that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe the best solution is to collectively move to another platform and leave Reddit to fix itself. There are corporate interests involved with Reddit, and it isn&#39;t exactly to their financial benefit, nor is it good for business to have disturbing stories about how sick and/or corrupt some powerful people are. It makes it harder to generate revenue from advertising. It seems highly likely (as well as logical) that the aforementioned is what&#39;s driving the changes we&#39;re all seeing. </p>

<p>Several platforms are in development on darkweb. However, the attack surface has to be reduced across all APIs before they&#39;ll be published to the Hidden Wiki. Right now there are too many risks to deploying websites for large amounts of people in the darkweb specifically because the military and intelligence agencies leverage it heavily (and are constantly scraping every last bit they can get at). Implementing a secure social media platform is a huge PITA on darkweb (especially a port of Diaspora). Segmentation and containerization are making it more secure, but it&#39;s slow to get it right because of all the details involved. Then there&#39;s the security level vs. the user experience (UX). If everything is too complicated, slow, or locked-down; you won&#39;t have users. It&#39;s a precarious balancing act of priorities.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t understand your concern OP. You talk about mods deleting the post. However the truth is that mods are capable of deleting the post one way or the other, whether the post has a submission statement or not. So the submission statement is incapable of having any effect on a mod&#39;s ability to delete the post. What the submission statement does affect, however, is a mod&#39;s ability to judge whether or not a post is garbage. So if there is a mod who is inclined to delete a post as a result of its seemingly low value, the submission statement has the effect of better enabling the mod to make a correct decision. What this means is that, on one hand, the submission statement may be a net positive, but on the other hand, if mods desire to delete posts, the submission statement is simply neutral, since they have the ability to delete posts regardless. So when the worst case scenario is neutral, there really isn&#39;t any logic that justifies having an argument or having a problem. Just saying man</p>
