<p>Trump was the guy that all the stars wanted to hang with then, and his tv show gave out $10&#39;s of thousands of dollars to charities every week.  </p>

<p>It was only when he decided to run against Queen Hillary that the hate machine started picking at him.</p>

<p>There are pictures of Snoop Dog, Kathy Griffin, and other supposed &quot;Trump haters&quot; taking happy smiling photos of Trump pre-election run.  Heck, even pictures with the Clinton&#39;s playing mutual admiration society. </p>

<p>It wasn&#39;t until he announced as a republican (gasp!) against Hillary (cue to clutch pearls) that Trump became a target for the hate. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>He&#39;s always been an example of a rich douchebag, it was his thing, but he did it somewhat ironically, like a character. He was just a pop culture figure before this serious presidential run.</p>

<p>People have since found out he was shitting in a golden toilet completely unironically, so his being rich is now rightfully seen as out of touch at best. </p>

<p>He owns his reputation though, and his supporters don&#39;t care one way or the other, so whatever - he can play the heel just fine.</p>

<p>Because</p>

<p>My impression was that he was always pretty hatable. People watched for the same reasons they watch reality TV with other hatable individuals. I never liked Trump, that’s for sure. The only redeeming factor of his existence was his obscene wealth, which also happens to be the entire focal point of his personality. </p>

<p>Bullshit, stop playing the victim card with Trump. He had a free ride, with<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/16/upshot/measuring-donald-trumps-mammoth-advantage-in-free-media.html">$2 Billion Worth of Free PR from the MSM</a> When Bernie failed the primary, he was the only populist canadiate remaining and I gave him the benefit of the doubt. But instead of keeping his promises and helping us, he has shown his true color, trying to take away our health care and giving massive tax cuts to the richest and corporations. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>People keep saying this. I hate trump and it has nothing to do with MSM. I didnt like him at all well before he decided to rub for president. </p>

<p>Trump has done a pretty good job of turning people off him all by himself by sayung things like
“A wife with a career is a dangerous thing”
“If dinners not ready when i get home i lose it”
“In a couple if years ill be dating you” to two 14 year old girls
“You have to treat em like shit” speaking about women
“The Innovation Center for U.S. Dairy conducted a survey of more than 1,000 adults 18 and over in April 2017. It not only found that seven percent thought that chocolate milk only comes from brown cows, but that 48 percent of people aren&#39;t sure where chocolate milk comes from.” Talking about his 1 year old daughter
“It’s very possible that I could be the first presidential candidate to run and make money on it.”
“I&#39;ll go backstage, before a show, and everyone&#39;s getting dressed and ready and everything else. And you know, no men are anywhere. And I&#39;m allowed to go in because I&#39;m the owner of the pageant and therefore I&#39;m inspecting it. You know I&#39;m inspecting, I want to make sure everything is good, the dresses, &quot;Is everyone OK?&quot;, you know they&#39;re standing there with no clothes, &quot;Is everybody OK?&quot;, and you see these incredible-looking women, and so I sort of get away with things like that.</p>

<p>And the list just goes on and on and on. And it just got so much worse after he decided to run.
He has repeatedly been sued for not allowing black people to live in his building, he’s been sued for ripping off people numerous times.
He is a con man and stands for nothing but himself, stop kidding yourself that he is some victim of the media, he is a pig

<p>I was looking for another article that was circulating a while back where a  psychologist said it was akin to a psyop. His short quips are a form of bias confirming programming. Psychological warfare imo. </p>

<p>Guys like Oreilly different side of the same coin. Breeds partisanship, something the US could use a lot less of.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So people were more exposed to Trumps bullshit but still voted for him so it&#39;s Hillarys fault he won? </p>

<p>People should have seen Trump for what he is, a professional bullshitter and borderline conman. But they fell for his populism hook, line and sinker. They didn&#39;t want to hear &quot;you have to change your way because the world is changing&quot; they wanted to hear &quot;I&#39;ll bring back coal jobs&quot; even though it&#39;s nye impossible. </p>

<p>It&#39;s on the people who voted for him in both the primaries and the general election that he is president. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes she pushed for him to be candidate because nobody thought any sane person would vote for him. </p>

<p>But in the end no matter who pushed Trump, the people still had to vote for him. So in the end regardless of what went on beforehand, people stood in the voting booth and thought Trump would the best pick for president.</p>

<p>In the end it&#39;s the fault of the people that voted for him. They had the last word in this discussion. </p>

<p>You can say &quot;Bernie would have won&quot;, you can say &quot;Trump is better than Killary&quot; or &quot;Hillary would have led to WW3&quot;. In the end the people had the choice to vote for him or not.</p>

<p>The American people are responsible for his election. </p>
