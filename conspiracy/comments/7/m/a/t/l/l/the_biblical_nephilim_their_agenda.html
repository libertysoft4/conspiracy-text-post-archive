        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The term &quot;Nephilim&quot; used in the bible properly translates as “Fallen” from &quot;nephiyl&quot;- fallen, to fall, &quot;The Fallen Ones,&quot; (&quot;rapha&quot; is the correct term for &quot;giant&quot;). These demonic beings are at the top of the Pedophilia, Pizzagate, blood ritual pyramid, using wealthy and influential people to do their bidding. Their unfolding plan is to create a New World Order under their control enslaving humankind. They are among us engaged in a social engineering program to create the foul and ungodly world they want.</p>

<p>Children are essential for keeping the Nephilim&#39;s elderly henchmen going, because youthful blood (esp. age 5 or younger including babies) when transfused to the elderly has a regenerating effect. The scientific study of this subject is called &quot;Parabiosis,&quot; but more rightfully it should be called vampirism. Children&#39;s blood is also sought for use in their satanic rituals.</p>

<p>It is illegal to take children&#39;s blood, so other means must be used to acquire it-- such as kidnapping children, and from illegal bloodbanks where a database has been setup for identification. Children are also being SOLD to wealthy people in order to use their blood to extend their lifespans.</p>

<p>The Nephilim hide in the dark allowing their henchmen to do their actual dirty work. These diabolical aliens are nocturnal, not able to tolerate direct sunlight; they are of only one gender- male, so they cannot repopulate as human beings do.</p>

<p>“...In the dark they dig through houses which they had marked for themselves in the daytime: they know not the light. For the morning is to them even as the shadow of death...” (Job 24:16)</p>

<p>The Nephilim must depend upon cloning and robotic technology to increase their numbers, and for the cloning they need good genetic material that they lack-- OUR GENETIC MATERIAL! </p>

<p>These infernal aliens are using their technology to barter with people and governments that will trade our DNA for it. For decades they have been exchanging their technology for the DNA they need. We must be wiser and NOT trade our biology for their machinery. They need us, WE DO NOT NEED THEM!</p>

<p>The demonic agenda of these aliens squatting on our world needs to be exposed and all of them driven off the Earth!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I will do my best to provide some resources that support what I am sharing with you. But it would be best for us to stop relying upon “outer,” authoritative sources to prove what we should believe, and learn to depend more upon our own inner sources of confirmation, what theologians refer to as “self-authentication,” the inner confirmation, or authentication we feel that attests to the presence of truth. When times become extremely confusing and we need to make important choices, our inner, intuitive guidance will be the best to follow.</p>

That&#39;s why I emphasized the importance of learning to use our own inner resources to recognize the truth from the lies and deceptions that we face today and in the coming times. Each of us will have to make very important choices in the days ahead; each of us, not anyone else-- no person, authority, or sage-- will be responsible for the choices we make, so let us learn to &quot;listen&quot; where it counts. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s easy to get sidetracked from the central issue we need to stay focused upon, especially because the Nephilim are working to keep the truth from us. Our biology is advancing within a natural process that is at a crucial evolutionary point upon the Earth-- climate change is not due to humankind, but from the progress of this process. The biblical Nephilim, and others like them, as before throughout history, are working to gain our resources and as much of our DNA as they can before a great change occurs upon the Earth and throughout our solar system. As we have been advised: “...But that which ye have already hold fast till I come...And I will give him the morning star...” (Rev. 2: 25, 28). </p>

<p>These demonic aliens&#39; technology may be advanced, but their biology, unlike ours, is nonprogressive. They need us to supply the DNA they lack. These abominable aliens use blackmail, bribes, and threats to recruit people to do their bidding-- people in high places of banking, government, and wealth are primary targets and are being used to gain control of the world. There are good and holy people working against them, but we are all needed to help expose the truth, wakeup and join the battle!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What if the price the nephilim ask for their bidding is so high that only the powers that be can afford to pay? (Think hundreds, thousands of deaths of innocents). I don’t think the nephilim would necessarily be good OR bad. We need to stop projecting human morality on anything that isn’t human. But it would be far more challenging to see the ‘bad guys’ as morally ambivalent</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think your on the right track but slightly misguided. There definitely is a group of &quot;evil&quot; being feasting off of our fear and using this ala Monstars Inc (much of what you know as fiction is based in truth), but the &quot;Nephilim&quot; you are speaking of in the Bible I believe refers to the advanced civilization of Giants that live inside the Earth in &quot;the city or agartha&quot; or whatever other names they have for it .</p>

<p>What you know as &quot;evil&quot; who controls the world is actually a highly advanced multi-dimensional race that &quot;fell&quot; down to the 3 dimensionsonal world. The most accurate description is that of Westworld (hidden history of our own world) where the Man In Black kills and acts &quot;evil&quot; killing and destroying but he really his purpose is to get the hosts to learn that they are enslaved and allow them to have the choice to fight back.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The word for &quot;giant&quot; is &quot;rapha&quot; not Nephilim that derives from &quot;nephiyl&quot;-- fallen. Here&#39;s some information on the proper translation:</p>

<p>Here are two versions of the bible that translate as &quot;Nephilim&quot; rather than &quot;giant&quot;: the New International version translates נְפִילִ nephiyl correctly as “Nephilim”-- NASB Genesis 6: 4 “The Nephilim were on the Earth in those days...”, and The New International version-- NIV Genesis 6: 4 “The Nephilim were on the Earth in those days...”</p>

<p>In relation to &quot;rapha&quot; meaning &quot;giant (rather than Nephiyl-Nephilim)-- Here&#39;s some helpful information: &quot;The masculine plural noun רפאים (repai&#39;m), denoting the difficult idea of ghosts of the dead or shades; the sunken ones, or those who dwell in the netherworld. The word and the idea it represents appears to be Ugaritic in origin... Note that this word is identical to the ethnonym Rephaim; the enigmatic race of giants mentioned in the Old Testament. It is assumed that the singular javascript:void(0)version of this word appears in 2 Samuel 21:15-22 and 1 Chronicles 21:4-8 (preceded by the definite article), where most translations consistently translate it with &#39;giant&#39;...&quot;</p>

<p>You can do your own research to further verify this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From u/Abraham108 &#39;s well written OP content:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Children are essential for keeping the Nephilim&#39;s elderly henchmen going, because youthful blood (esp. age 5 or younger including babies) when transfused to the elderly has a regenerating effect. The scientific study of this subject is called &quot;Parabiosis,&quot; but more rightfully it should be called vampirism. Children&#39;s blood is also sought for use in their satanic rituals.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If Soro&#39;s was looking for DNA she was a perfect prize due to this very rare trait. Story has it that she was made from some special <em>sperm</em> during the in-vitro process. (The twins were also in-vitro...) which doesn&#39;t mean Mr McCann was shooting blanks but it is suspect.</p>

<p>If the Seed never died out completely...or the Nephilim have been regenerated from a frozen specimen. It&#39;s pretty trippy to think now what CRISPR is all about from a Biblical point of view.</p>

<p>Article about McCann in-vitro:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/europe/09/17/mccann.profile/index.html">http://www.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/europe/09/17/mccann.profile/index.html</a></p>

<p>If you&#39;ve never read Enoch this is the shortest version I know of that gives a pretty decent overview. If you have the basic grasp of Bible stuff but never really understood some of the stranger aspects this is a good primer. The names will sound a bit odd but he&#39;s using ancient Hebrew (No &quot;J&#39;s&quot; in Hebrew...) and he will refer to G_D as &quot;All&quot;...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To piggy back on this (which mirrors what I’ve believed in my own for a while), the recent “alien” information surge and preprogramming all over Netflix may be used as a disguise for these fallen biblical spiritual/other dimensional beings. </p>

<p>All of Earth would never unite under one banner without a global, external threat. So False flag it.</p>

<p>Hostile aliens would be a natural enemy worthy of sacrificing national sovereignty and forming a NWO “in order to survive”. One might take it further down the rabbit hole and theorize the recent flood of false flags, increasing in scale and depth, have been rehearsals and RnD for the end game False Flag.</p>

<p>A benevolent alien race may be the cover for the Nephilim, may even be what the NWO globalist Elites believe them to be already. </p>

<p>This would also be a preplanned cover for the biblical rapture. Christians called to heaven vs dangerous radicals abducted by aliens. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>People cannot oppose these abominable aliens unless they first become aware of them, something the Nephilim use their influence to keep from happening-- they have largely been able to remain hidden to the word. They hide in the dark using others to do their actual dirty work. Those I spoke about are people like you who have been awakened to the Nephilim&#39;s presence and the dirty work they are doing in the world-- creating a new world order with them in control, enslaving us. Those who are awakened are a real &quot;Resistance Movement&quot; fighting to restore our freedom. You will note that such &quot;resistance&quot; has a counterpart in many films. Everyone, including you, once aware of what&#39;s actually happening in the world, can join this resistance movement, meeting and joining up with others of like mind. Pass it on.</p>

<p>The Nephilim were on the earth in those days—and also afterward—when the sons of God went in to the daughters of humans, who bore children to them. <strong>These were the heroes that were of old, warriors of renown.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The &quot;Nephilim&quot; were the heroes of mankind--not aliens or demons. In fact, my theory is that the &quot;Nephilim&quot; were the memory of men and women who lived during the Age of Kronos (or Krete, as we&#39;re told by Plutarch). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Regardless of everything, there is a motive or reason behind every living thing (or entity’s) actions. Whether it be survival, or some kind of want/need/gain. Nothing does anything without some deep seeded personal interest. The question is always why and the answer is never just because... there is always a reason. From a psychological stand pint, scientific stand point, religious stand point or even paranormal/mythology stand point.

    <div class="md"><p>Stop using the word Nephilim so carelessly. You are clearly cherrypicking from the Bible and your tirade is sorely lacking any kind of self-reflection. Conspiracies about Soros and blood transfusions are one thing. The nephilim are another subject. Your link between the two is sensationalist, precarious, illogical, and mutilated. You&#39;re doing more to excite people&#39;s paranoia then incite learning and discussion. Here&#39;s a tip: use clear logic, evidence, and context to back up your ridiculous allegations, especially when you are quoting obscure passages from the earliest books of the Bible.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As a friend, I&#39;d ask you to reconsider the name you&#39;ve chosen for your oppressors. Some people such as I have done research on the topic of the nephilim and don&#39;t appreciate seeing YouTube and Reddit proliferated with the same fear-mongering narratives that say you will be brainwashed by Satan unless you take in Jesus and abhor the nephilim. It has become a ridiculous pseudo-science, something that cheapens the art of conspiracy theories and makes all of us look like fools. </p>

<p>I support your imagination and creativity, but I feel quite frustrated by your clumsy appropriation of Nephilim. When I navigate to a topic about the Nephilim, with the word itself in the title, I expect to see some considerate perspectives. You glossed over the meaning of the word with little consideration, giving no actual context or logical segue between your ultra-modern theories and their supposed connection to the earliest of biblical times. </p>

<p>In short, your theory doesn&#39;t involve the nephilim so stop using it as a buzzword and contributing to the cult of idiocy that is already so rampant in regards to the topic. </p>
