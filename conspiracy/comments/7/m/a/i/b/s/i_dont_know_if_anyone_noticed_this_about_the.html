        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The Solar Eclipse on August 21, 2017 went from Oregon (33rd State) to South Carolina (8th State). 33 days later was September 23, 2017, which was the Revelation 12 sign as predicted in the bible. 8 days later was the Las Vegas Shooting.</p>

<p>What is also interesting is this. Hugh Hefner died at age 91 on September 27, 2017. Dion Lewis (RB for the patriots, also gonna win SB MVP) turned 27. The shooter was age 64. 91-64=27 September 27th is the 270th day of the year. September 27th is also 4 days after September 23rd and 4 days before October 1st. Hugh Hefner was the playboy creator, and what animal goes with playboy? The Bunny! Or rabbit. In the Chinese zodiac, the playboy bunny is the 4th sign. </p>

<p>So we have 33 and 8, or 33, 4, and 4.</p>

<p>The 911 attacks were September 11, 2001, or 9/11/01.
Las Vegas shooting on October 1st, 2017 was at Route 91 festival, on 10/1, 91 and 10/1 = 91101 = 9/11/01
So clearly there is a link between 911 and Las Vegas.</p>

<p>Also, on September 22, 2017, Puerto Rico suffered a Dam Break. In Evan Almighty, the dam break occurred on September 22nd!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpmRQI64Lzk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpmRQI64Lzk</a>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmrVYSxcxVQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmrVYSxcxVQ</a></p>

<p>Between September 22nd and 23rd, there is 1 day.
Between September 23rd and 27th there is 4 days
Between September 27th and October 1st, there is 4 days.</p>

<p>1, 4, and 4 = 144. Kinda like the 144,000 selected in the bible.</p>

<p>September 11 is the 254th day of the year.</p>

<p>Solar Eclipse 2017 = 33rd state to 8th state (33-8 = 25)
Now, if we look at the next Solar Eclipse: it is in 2045, and is from California (31st State) to Florida (27th state). (31 - 27 = 4)
25 and 4 = 254</p>

<p>The title of this book is &quot;End of days 2014 to 2018, new world order by 2045&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Days-2014-2018-World-Order-ebook/dp/B00I0MQ8KG">https://www.amazon.com/Days-2014-2018-World-Order-ebook/dp/B00I0MQ8KG</a></p>

<p>Now, what does this title mean? Well, 2045-2014 = 31, 2045 - 2018 = 27. The book is hinting at the Solar Eclipse in 2045!</p>

<p>Now, if you look at 44 years after 9/11, and go back 33 days, you arrive at August 9, 2045. That is the day of the fake alien invasion. The New World Order will go into effect on August 11, 2045. August 9th = 221st day, so 144 days left. August 11th = 233rd day, but if you start the calendar according to the astrological year, which starts March 21, you subtract 79 from 223. (223-79=144) So, August 9 and August 11 have 144 in them. Not only that, but August 9th, August 10th, and August 11th are the 221st, 222nd, and 223rd days of the year respectively. 221 + 222 + 223 = 666.</p>

<p>So there you have it, the solar eclipse this year was a sign of the times. Get ready for the alien invasion in 2045. It&#39;s gonna be a massive hoax!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Happy Gilmore predicted this actually. Happy Gilmore wears a Boston Bruins was fined $25,000 and suspended 1 month. Tom Brady plays for the New England Patriots (Boston Team) and is suspended 4 games, fined $25,000. (4 and 25 are the eclipse differences). Dion Lewis is #33 also, the freemason signature. In the Illuminati &quot;Professional Sports&quot;, the player has 4, 5, and 6 spikes, like Brady&#39;s 4th, 5th, and 6th ring. It also has a bag with money coming out of it, like a deflated football. </p>

<p>SB39 MVP = Deion Branch
SB52 MVP = Dion Lewis</p>

<p>Also, Deion Sanders is involved. So you have three &quot;D&#39;s&quot; which is 3 x 4 = 12, and then S, B, L, which is 19 + 2 + 12 = 33. 
12 + 33 = 45</p>

<p>Also, in SB51, the player who scored the Game winning TD was James White (JW = 10 + 23 = 33), and he has the number 28.</p>

<p>Whatis important about 28 and 33, well 2012 and 2017 of course! These are the years &quot;Prometheus&quot; and &quot;Alien Covenant&quot; were released. Also, 1984 is 28 years before 2012, and 33 years before 2017. &quot;1984&quot; the book was released June 8, 1949, 31 years after June 8, 1918 Solar Eclipse. California = 31st state, California became a state on September 9. September is 31 days after August 9.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was with you until you recommended fucking abilify. Op doesn&#39;t seem to be psychotic and abilify causes a truck-load of side effects, including permanent muscle twitchs. Think it&#39;s a good idea to recommend a drug that causes permanent muscle twitchs to someone you think is psychotic? So they can sit there wondering why the meds they took to correct hallucinations/delusions makes it feel like they have bugs crawling under their skin?  I know someone who took abilify for a few months about a decade ago and still feels a twitching sensation crawling down his face and around back of his skull as a result. The abilify made  this person&#39;s problems worse on more levels than it ever made them better. </p>

<p>Op likes to play with numbers and search for patterns...so be it...who really gives a shit?</p>
