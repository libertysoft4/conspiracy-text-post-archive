    <div class="md"><p>People need to do 1 hour of research to see who they really are and not what they claim to be. Claiming to be Jewish and having zero blood connection (~95 % have no connection) then using it to be the perpetual victim is the game.  Then the fear of being called an anti Semite gives them free reign. Then of course there is doubt that Shem even existed,  making being Semetic possibly made up. They&#39;ve hijacked a religion to give themselves credibility and everyone has taken the bait. It&#39;s amazing actually.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not surprising . Someone put together a huge list of names of powerful people and most were Jewish.

    <div class="md"><p>Well NYC Ashkenazi Jews have an average IQ a full standard deviation above the population average, so simply looking for &quot;smart people in NY&quot; is going to yield an enormously disproportionate sample of Jews compared to randomly sampling the general population. An unbiased sampling of 130+ IQ people in NYC will be 41% Jewish! Throw some network effect bias (people tend to know and hire people like themselves) and the result doesn&#39;t surprise me at all.</p>

<p>So I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any active conspiracy necessary to explain why rich companies in NYC are so Jewish.</p>

<p>It does result in their group having a huge amount of political power, though, no question there. And they do make use of it.</p>

<p>...^that&#39;s my issue in the first place. :\    It&#39;s not just creepy, but it&#39;s reminiscent of a heinous, not-so-distant history in which Jewish people were targeted and forced to wear Star of David brands.</p>

<p>Well, Jewish people aren&#39;t the ones publishing photos labeling those who are &quot;non-Jewish&quot;, are they...?<br/>
And it doesn&#39;t make sense to use what <em>some</em> Jewish people may say as a justification for this list— &#39;cause it&#39;s not like people (of every ethnicity imaginable) don&#39;t express opinions about people outside their groups. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</p>

<p>yeah I can see that. But in this case, its just pointing out how this group of people who is such a tiny fractional minority of the whole, is so overwhelmingly disproportionately in positions of power, money, and media</p>

<p>They&#39;re not that I know of, but who knows. Maybe there are Goy/Goyim memes and jokes of various sorts</p>

<p>My thing is that I always heard the Jew Conspiracy my whole life and was always like, &quot;Meh, who knows ¯_(ツ)_/¯ &quot;</p>

<p>But then the more I started reading, digging, and looking into it, the more it started becoming legit</p>

<p>Nope, I&#39;m successful in my own work and businesses and have paid of real estate investments, and various other things going on. I really don&#39;t hate anyone, however after hearing about the &quot;Joo&quot; conspiracy for so long, after doing some independent research, it seems to check out.</p>

<p>Of course no one is really doing anything to rise up against the &quot;masters&quot; rothschilds/sors/banksters/fed/fiat, etc. So shit will roll down hill as usual until a time far in the future when A.I. starts genetically engineering super humans with super intelligence who will be of no religion or nationality. Then hopefully that group of advanced humans will fuck off to some new earth and let the rest of the idiots all nuke each other here and end this place</p>

<p>True, it isn&#39;t proof, so to speak, but his account is a primary source until it&#39;s proven to be fictitious.

<p>Sure but he breaks down crying at one point (episode 2?)... and citizens of The Netherlands are not entangled in global politics like Russians or Americans could be... I mean, why would he deceive the world, while appearing 100% sympathetic and basically praise Jesus christ, some random guy from the Netherlands? Everything he says makes sense and fits with &quot;power corrupts&quot; like we know from crimes and scandals of the past. </p>

<p>Some of my childhood friends were Jews, and I respect them a lot to this day. But there can be factions within Judaism, just like there were secrets in Nazi Germany where many had no idea of concentration camps... if the powerful have a crazy idea, there is nothing within lower ranks that necessarily is set up to stop them from carrying out evil crazy shit behind the curtains... :(</p>

<p>Please allow me to correct you. This is very important. The Rothschilds do not and have never &quot;controlled&quot; the Vatican&#39;s wealth. They were merely bankers for the papacy in the mid 1800s, and only did what the popes told them to do. <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/RomeRules/comments/7ee0uo/carl_rothschild_kissed_the_popes_hand_and_was/">Carl Rothschild was Knighted by the Pope and kissed the pope&#39;s hand</a>.

    <div class="md"><p>That book explains how the Jesuit Order <em>banned</em> Jews by blood. The Jesuits were <em>anti-Jewish</em> for over 350 years. Their blood discrimination against Jews was stricter than that of those employed by the Nazis for determining Jewish ancestory. The Jesuits later went on to found the modern antisemitic movement proclaiming of a then-unheard-of &quot;Jew World Order&quot; style conspiracy, immediately subsequent to the Jews having been freed from the ghettos in the late 1800s and early 1900s. It was literally impossible for Jews to have been in some of the positions they claimed. For example they claimed Jews ran freemasonry when it was illegal for Jews to even be part of any type of social clubs.</p>

<p>Bottom line is that website is neo-Nazi propaganda. The &quot;reviewer&quot; does not even correctly distinguish between a crypto-Jew and a converso, and given that this confusion is at the source of his misrepresentative &quot;synopsis&quot;, it is enough to dismiss him entirely. The author of the book never says any early Jesuits were &quot;crypto-Jews&quot; yet that term is used throughout the supposed &quot;review,&quot; or more accurately, pseudo-intellectual anti-Semite greaserag seeking to capitalize on a title which at to its viewers, at first glance, imagine affirms their beliefs. This is enabled to happen because of an unwillingness to verify the contexts of what one is reading. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Like I said, I haven&#39;t read it yet. But after a quick skim of the review, it appears you are right that the book deals with the eventual discrimination against Jews, but that&#39;s only a part of it. And the book&#39;s author <em>does</em> say that some early Jesuits were Jews.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The presence and influence of conversos in the Society of Jesus was strong from the beginning. Of the seven founding members, Maryks provides categorical evidence that four were of Jewish ancestry — Salmeron, Laínez, Bobadilla, and Rodrigues. In addition, Loyola himself has long been noted for his strong philo-Semitism, and one recent PhD thesis[1] has even advanced a convincing argument that Loyola’s maternal grandparents, (his grandfather, Dr. Martín García de Licona, was a merchant and financial advisor at court), were full-blooded conversos — thus rendering the ‘Basque nobleman’ halachically Jewish. Jewish scholar of the Inquisition, Henry Kamen, who had earlier argued that the Inquisition was “a weapon of social welfare” used mainly to obliterate the conversos as a distinct class capable of offering social and economic competition to ‘Old Christians,’ once voiced his own personal view that Loyola was “a deep and sincere spiritual Semite.”[2]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Straightforward assessments of the reasons for Loyola’s philo-Semitism are, as Maryks admirably elucidates, complicated by the ubiquitous presence of converso propaganda. More specifically, Loyola’s reputation as an ardent admirer of the Jews rests predominantly on a series of anecdotes and remarks attributed to him — and many of these derive from biographies penned shortly after his death by converso Jesuits aiming to promote and defend their interests. For example, the only source for the argument that Loyola had an overwhelming desire to be of Jewish origin so that he could “become a relative of Christ and his Mother” is the first official biography of Loyola — penned by the converso Pedro de Ribadeneyra. Ribadeneyra is described by Maryks as “a closet-converso” who distorted many now-established facts about Loyola’s life, including a concealment of the fact that “the Inquisition in Alcalá had accused Loyola of being a crypto-Jew.” (43) An important aspect of Ribadeneyra’s biography was thus the promotion of the idea that being Jewish was desirable and admirable — Loyola’s philo-Semitism (real or imagined) was intended to be emulated. Meanwhile the sinister aspects of crypto-Judaism, and their suppression by the Inquisition, were excised from the story altogether.</p>

<p>Your name calling and insults of the website and the reviewer don&#39;t bother me. The reviewer appears to be a PhD legit academia level researcher, not some neo-nazi conspiracy theorist. I appreciate your input, but I look forward to reading about the periods before and after the Jesuits were successful at weeding out the Jews. </p>

<p>The whole point is that the Jesuits have been known as anti-Jewish for the large majority of their history. Saying that there were some Jewish converts in the early Jesuits is not only a genetic and associative fallacy, but it is ignorant of the nature of the Jesuit Order, their initial foundlings, and their rules and constitutions when presented as an argument that Jesuits during any period in the last 400 years have been or are currently somehow influenced by Jews.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While I appreciate your admitting using the Wikipedia description of TOO, why not link to <a href="http://www.theoccidentalobserver.net/mission/">their actual mission statement instead?</a> It even directly addresses the negative themes/associations you claim it has.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Occidental Observer will present original content touching on the themes of white identity, white interests, and the culture of the West. Such a mission statement is sure to be dismissed as extremism of the worst sort in today’s intellectual climate—perhaps even as a sign of psychiatric disorder. Yet there is a compelling need for such a site. A great many other identifiable groups in the multicultural West have a strong sense of identity and interest, but overt expressions of white identity and white interests (or European-American identity and interests) are rarely found among the peoples who founded these societies and who continue to make up the majority.</p>

<p>This is a completely unnatural state of affairs—the result of a prolonged assault on the legitimacy of these concepts by cultural elites that have dominated public discourse on issues of race and ethnicity since before World War II. We reject labels such as “white supremacist” or “racist” that are routinely bestowed on assertions of white identity and interests as a means of muzzling their expression. All peoples have ethnic interests and all peoples have a legitimate right to assert their interests, to construct societies that reflect their culture, and to define the borders of their kinship group.</p>

<p>We are highly cognizant of the fact that many of the most strident critics of the legitimacy of white identity and interests have a strong sense of their own ethnic identity and interests. And they have a deep sense of the importance of preserving their people and culture. Non-Western peoples throughout the world continue to seek political power, and they attempt to control their borders, establish their own cultures, and defend their perceived interests....</p>

<p>I agree with your thoughts about how easy it is to fake a PhD. I guess I don&#39;t really care whether it&#39;s just a pen name either. All I want is truth, regardless of the source.</p>

<p>In explaining Loyola’s lax requirements for converso applicants, and resultant acquiescence in flooding the Society with crypto-Jews, it is strange that Maryks should abandon his own prior suggestion that the founding of the Jesuits may have rested on a quid pro quo with the converso elite in favor of a less convincing theory based on a putative and ill-explained “trust” that Loyola possessed for Jews. Unfortunately this is a common theme throughout Jewish historiography, where the facts and conclusions presented in the same text are often on entirely different trajectories. <strong>In a similar vein, Maryks skeletal explanation that crypto-Jews flooded the Jesuits simply because Loyola had “numerous contacts with the converso spiritual and merchant network” before he founded the Society of Jesus, seems woefully inadequate and lacking in context.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m on my phone so proper formatting is difficult. Just wanted to give on last series of quotes from the article that indicate the book itself is about much more than just Jesuits discriminating against Jews. I apologize for any formatting weirdness. </p>

<p>Hopefully we can exchange ideas again once I&#39;m not on my phone. I value you your obvious knowledge of all things Roman, but am curious why you are always so quick to dismiss Jewish influence when it&#39;s arguably easier to observe in modern times.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In this unpolished but interesting book, Maryks illuminates this struggle with reference to previously undiscovered material, in the process shedding light on some of the most important recurring themes of reactive anti-Semitism: Jewish ethnocentrism, nepotism, the tendency to monopoly, and the strategic use of alliances with European elites. Perhaps most fascinating of all, Maryks makes significant reference to Jewish responses to European efforts to stifle their influence, some of which are remarkable in the close manner in which they parallel modern examples of Jewish apologetic propaganda. As such, The Jesuit Order as a Synagogue of Jews is highly recommended for anyone seeking to understand, via an easily-digested historical case study, the dynamics of the ethnic conflict between Jews and Europeans.</p>

<p>Maryks divides his text into four well-paced chapters. The first provides readers with ‘The Historical Context of Purity-of-Blood Discrimination (1391–1547),’ a detailed standalone introduction to the nature of the ‘New Christian’ problem in Iberia but which should be read in conjunction with MacDonald’s work on the same theme. The second chapter concerns ‘Early Jesuit Pro-Converso Policy (1540–72),’ which demonstrates the intensive manner in which crypto-Jews infiltrated key positions in the Society of Jesus, adapting its ideological positions in accordance with their interests, and eventually establishing a monopoly on top positions that extended to the Vatican.  The third chapter, ‘Discrimination Against Jesuits of Jewish Lineage (1573–93),’ concerns the establishment of a movement acting against the crypto-Jewish strategy, with an analysis of the key figures and their rationale. The fourth chapter, ‘Jesuit Opposition to the Purity-of-Blood Discrimination (1576–1608),’ examines the efforts of crypto-Jewish Jesuits to fight back against the European counter-strategy, often involving the employment of tactics and stances that are now familiar to us as the hallmarks of a Jewish intellectual movement.</p>

<p>This sequence parallels the processes that led to the Inquisition—New Christians establishing themselves in top positions in Spanish politics, business, and culture, provoking a reaction by the Old Christians aimed at regaining power, followed by Jewish counter efforts against the Inquisition and the against the Spanish government generally, the latter typically played out on the international scene.</p>

<p>One of the key strengths of this fascinating book is that Maryks can rely on relatively recent genealogical discoveries to prove beyond doubt that many of the individuals once merely “accused” of being crypto-Jews were undeniably of Jewish lineage. Maryks can thus cut through a clouded period in which ancestry was vital and yet fogged with accusations, denials, and counter-accusations, with tremendous clarity. In the author’s words (xxix), “racial tensions played a pivotal role in early Jesuit history.”</p>

<p>Opening his book, Maryks recalls delivering a paper on converso influence in the Jesuits, and afterwards receiving an email from a man with origins in the Iberian peninsula. The email concerned the remarkably long survival of crypto-Jewish behaviors in the sender’s family:</p>

<p><em>From Friday evening through Saturday evening, his grandfather would hide the image of baby Jesus from a large framed picture of St. Anthony that he kept in his home. It was, in fact, a wind-up music box. On Fridays he would wind up the mechanism and push a button, so that Jesus would disappear out of St. Anthony’s arms, hidden in the upper frame of the picture. On Saturdays he would push the button, so that Jesus would come back out from hiding into St. Anthony’s arms. As eldest son in his family, my correspondent was told this story by his father, who also asked him to eat only kosher food. (xv)</em></p>

<p>The survival of such eccentric, and in this case apparently trivial, forms of crypto-Judaism into what one assumes to be the early twentieth century, might appear to be little more than a socio-historical curio. In actual fact, however, it is a small but memorable vestige of what was once a very powerful means of continuing the Jewish group evolutionary strategy in the Iberian peninsula after 1391 — an overwhelmingly hostile environment. In a political, religious, and social context devoid of the synagogue and many of the most visible aspects of Judaism, small reminders of group difference, even otherwise trivial ones like hiding images of Jesus or adhering to discreet dietary rules, became vital methods for retaining group cohesion.</p>

<p>For some time, these methods were largely successful in facilitating the continuance of Jewish life ‘under the noses’ of the Christian host society. During this successful period, conversos were able to expand nepotistic monopolies of influence in a wide range of civic and even (Christian) religious spheres. When it failed, however, the consequences could be catastrophic. Maryks points out (xxii) that from its founding in 1540 to 1593, the Society of Jesus had no discriminatory legislation against individuals of Jewish heritage, and that during this period converso Jesuits “held the highest administrative offices, and defined the Society’s institutional development and spirituality.” However, significant resistance to this crypto-Jewish monopoly had developed by the latter date, and from 1593 to 1608 a power struggle resulted in the defeat of the crypto-Jewish element and the introduction of laws prohibiting the admittance of members of ‘impure blood.’ From 1608 until 1946 this involved a review of the ancestry of any potential member of the Society of Jesus, up to the fifth generation.</p>

<p>The Vatican owns property in Jerusalem and Netanyahu was going to give the Pope Mt. Zion. Shimon Peres already deeded the Temple Mount and Old City of Jerusalem. So both Labor and Likud parties in Israel are serving the Vatican. </p>

<p>You are right though, at least partially about the Holocaust, that it was in part a Jewish conspiracy. The Jews of Hungary betrayed their own Jewish people by sending 300,000 to the camps in exchange for their labor Zionist buddies to go to Israel.</p>

<p>If you are talking about the anti-Semitism that actually led to the holocaust, that was the work of the Jesuits and Vatican as is plainly shown in Kertzer&#39;s work, <em>The Popes Against the Jews</em> - the modern antisemitic movement which blamed Jews for seeking and having attained world domination were started by the Jesuit Papacy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So it is racism for a company to reject anti-Semitism discriminatory practices and to hire employees who are Jewish. Where is the proof there is preferential treatment? If the media and entertainment industry were the only few areas of business where Jews could get job and excel, more Jews will choose those businesses as a career choice and fields of study for their college degree The universities who had the top journalism, film and TV production schools were the ones who admitted Jewish students early on without strict quotas. Then in the 1939s Jewish refugees began to arrive from Nazi occupied countries in Europe.
