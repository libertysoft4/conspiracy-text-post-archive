<p>And yes you can say Trump is part of the 1% but really, from his actions this year, and THEIR actions this year, he doesn&#39;t seem to be on their side, at this moment in time. </p>

<ol>
<li>Elites got richer by 1000 times in 2017 or something like that. Did this trickle down? Nope. EVIL!</li>
<li>Elites worship something red with horns. In my book, that&#39;s not good. EVIL!</li>
<li>Thousands of pedos arrested. Good but why not earlier? EVIL!</li>
<li>MSM not reporting (3) EVIL!</li>
<li>Kiddies sacrificed, raped and tortured? EVIL!</li>
<li>Human trafficking in this day and age, wtf??? EVIL!</li>
<li>Cabal wants war, because of more profits, wtf!!! EVIL!</li>
<li>MSMs promote war for ... profit. EVIL!</li>
<li>UN (gangsters united in suits and ties) been in Africa for god knows how 50+ years but is it still a crappy desolate country. EVIL!</li>
<li>GMOs, sugar, fluoride, chems released in the air and water to keep us dumb. Fucking EVIL! </li>
<li>DC pedo ring to keep the politcians in check. Really fucking EVIL!</li>
<li>List goes on ........</li>
</ol>

<p>Point being. This is just about Good vs Evil, not about party ideology, race, or agenda. It&#39;s just them vs us. And I have faith many of us are inherently good. So why not use POTUS (because of his PRESENT actions) for the time being to kill off the sick elites for good this time. We have a great opportunity after what we thought was no chance for him to be in power.</p>

<p>Anyway, logical as fuck, but I&#39;m guessing the anti trump shills will start hitting this hard :D</p>

<p>Merry friggen Xmas!</p>

<p>EDIT: as predicted 10 EST is when the anti trump muppets turn up</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cannot copy paste from a title. But OP did say..</p>

<p>&quot;Can we 99% grow up,stop being divided and fight back&quot; </p>

<p>Your statement is why we will never make any progress in making this country great for anyone but the elites. It does not matter the puppet. Obama gave billions to the banks who did nothing for us with it. An if people like OP are attempting to bridge a gap and people like you come around an immediately dismiss the message i quoted above we will get nowhere. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We do not need to support any puppets this one included. In my opinion we need to vote every single politician who currently hold office in DC out and start fresh with a younger more in touch group of diverse people that actually represent the American people and have not been bought out by the corporations. To me the beauty of life is we as a whole will never fully agree on anything which is great cause it keeps life interesting. But if we can put partisan issues aside for just 1 election cycle we can end this circlejerk of whose gang is better the Crips or the bloods, when it has been proven time and time again the puppet does not matter the rich will get tax cuts and we get fucked. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The bullshit is going to happen whether you get mad at it or not. A lot of people before you and even me have focused on a lot of government corruption and bullshit. An the only that happens is the color of the gang gets changed. The rich and corporations are favored over us. So yeah, let&#39;s not waste out time or energy bitching about things we cannot change. Instead let us focus our time and energy on making an actual change in November. Focus our energies on exposing the government agents who would actively try to infiltrate this movement and derail it so they can keep their scams going. Just my opinion. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trumps policies are very good for the elite and very bad for the common person.  He has expanded CIA drone strike powers, greatly reduced the tax burden on the wealthy(which will eventually lead to a greater economic burden placed upon lower income earners and negatively impact the US&#39;s ability to trade), gutted environmental protections, and he&#39;s just getting warmed up.  Extreme right wing policies cannot truly be populist - it will lead to more mega-corporations that buy out all of their competition and greater concentrations of extreme individual wealth.  The &quot;99%&quot; cannot organize and fight back when they cannot even understand the basic facts pertaining to the reality of what is unfolding before them.  Trump&#39;s policies are intended to rob sub-millionaires blind, and we have people who want to &quot;use Trump as a spearhead&quot; whatever that means.  Trump is just the next step in a logical progression, the next phase of psychologically and sociologically beating the general populace into an impotent lump.  Perhaps if the 99% were to create a movement based upon anti-hierarchical mutual aid and independence, they could start to stand on their own two feet, rendering political apparatuses superfluous and granting common people some semblance of actual power.  Until then, we are at the mercy of the social engineers.  Oh, and all the while that we fiddle-fart around they are dumping billions of dollars into highly advanced technologies that we are not allowed to know anything about.  Psychotronics, brain manipulation, AI, propaganda...they have been researching these topics for a very long time.  Their holy grail is a system whereby they can physically control peoples&#39;s minds remotely, and I don&#39;t know if they&#39;re too far off.</p>

<p>I don’t believe that any candidate will bring about that revolution. Normal people will. I don’t think that revolution will involve a leader the way you think about a leader. Bernie would’ve been as close as we can hope for, and they blatantly replaced him with their candidate. They did it obviously, and then basically acted like “yeah, what are you gonna do about it?” </p>

<p>And guess what?  No one did anything about it.</p>

<p>But hey, go ahead and cast your vote in the next election for Trump. Keep believing in the system. Keep believing in the 2 carefully crafted candidates you’ll be offered. You seriously think the 1% will actually give you a choice that matters for the POTUS? If you want the change you’re talking about, you need to realize that both sides are in on it. Trump is not your friend. He doesn’t give a fuck about you. That should be clear to anyone paying attention. </p>

<p>Almost all conspiracies are about manipulating and control human kind by the 1%. Can we 99% just grow up, stop being divided and start fighting back?</p>

<p>Sadly, this isn&#39;t likely to happen. Many people are intellectually lazy, and many more are intellectual cowards. They refuse to acknowledge the existence of the deep state. Even if you could somehow force them to acknowledge this fact, many of them would just go apeshit and hurt themselves. Humans have been trained to have the minds of children.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Whether or not Trump is the real deal only God knows. We can&#39;t see into his heart. But, to be honest, he fits the general description of what the real deal would look like. He is independently wealthy, so he doesnt need to promise favors for campaign support. He has a huge ego, so he is indifferent to the personal attacks on his character. He just keeps pushing forward. He has experience being in the public eye, so he knows how to work and manipulate media to get his message out. And there are many other qualities Trump has that make him an ideal person to fight the fight. And, personally, I&#39;m betting that he is the truth. I could be wrong, but I don&#39;t see anyone else out there who is even close to being the savior that is needed. Trump is a ram not a sheep and we need a ram to fight this fight.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The 1% vs 99% meme is Occupy language.  It is the language of socialists.  It is the language of the real left, not the MSM/DNC/Obama/Clinton/pussy-hat left.  It is the language of Howard Zinn, Noam Chomsky, Chris Hedges, Cornell West, Ralph Nader, Richard Wolff, Michael Parenti.  These are the leaders of the the REAL left.  And their enemy is Trump (and the Republicans and Democrats as well).</p>

<p>If you want to fight evil, if you want to fight the cabal, if you want to fight the rich, if you want to fight establishment then reject both parties and become a socialist.  If not then don&#39;t speak about 1% and 99%.</p>

<p>they are just labels </p>

<p>All that is required is LOVE and understanding, that&#39;s it. </p>

<p>All I&#39;ve seen is one tribe vs another tribe, sure there is the crazy evil tribe who wants the whole world to burn while they party in their deep underground bunkers, and that&#39;s why all the above I mention should be banding together, and to do this, LOVE.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cannot copy paste from a title. But OP did say..</p>

<p>&quot;Can we 99% grow up,stop being divided and fight back&quot; </p>

<p>Your statement is why we will never make any progress in making this country great for anyone but the elites. It does not matter the puppet. Obama gave billions to the banks who did nothing for us with it. An if people like OP are attempting to bridge a gap and people like you come around an immediately dismiss the message i quoted above we will get nowhere. </p>
