<p>How much it cost to get to the moon?</p>

<p>All the 12 people referred to above were able to achieve this feat thanks to NASA&#39;s Apollo program. Total cost $25.4 billion (1973) ~ $129 billion (2011)</p>

<p><strong>THE MATHS ADDS UP! PROFIT x 1000 TIMES</strong> </p>

<hr/>

<p>So since mostly we are a capitalist society, we should have mines ALL over the moon right now in 2017, since 12 humans have been there already, and had the tech then, and should be advanced tech now, no? It is like teaching a toddler to learn the alphabet but when they are teens they are still learning the alphabet. This makes no sense. The human spirit is not like that. </p>

<p>IM HUMBLE O - we&#39;ve never ever been and it is one GIANT hoax. They know this is one giant hoax and they know as more time moves on it will get more difficult to cover the deception. Hence 21 trillion to make some grand deception like fake aliens disclosure, fake AI God or shit like that</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem isn&#39;t that we&#39;ve never been to the moon, but that we don&#39;t have the infrastructure to utilize quantities of the isotope to make it worthwhile. Although we <em>should</em> have fusion reactors in every state, every city for that matter, the money isn&#39;t there because the general public (which includes the politicians) just isn&#39;t educated enough to believe it&#39;s a good idea. Then there&#39;s a metric shit tonne of corporate propaganda to perpetuate the idea that fusion reactors are just little Chernobyls waiting to happen.</p>

<p>Personally, I think we should be getting 20% of our energy as a country from fusion reactors, but I&#39;m well aware of being in the minority on this. </p>

<p>But if this is the best reason you have to believe we didn&#39;t go to the moon, it&#39;s not good enough. And you believe both that the Earth is flat AND we didn&#39;t go to the moon, please do us all a favor and learn what evidence is and how to evaluate it. </p>

<p>Armstrongs return from the moon was nothing but bizarre, he barely talked and when he did he had a bunch of goons around him making sure he didn&#39;t go off pace.</p>

<p>If you told me we never went to the moon, or if you said we didn&#39;t  go in the 60&#39;s but we&#39;ve been a bunch of times now without the people knowing, well I wouldn&#39;t know what to believe.

<p>The &quot;news&quot; is a constant mix of truth/fiction/editorial opinion and omission. It is a constant task to separate these. The history of media is a history of propaganda, however, that doesn&#39;t mean everything ever said on tv is a lie. </p>

<p>Take the &quot;coverage&quot; of Saddam Hussain from 2001-2002. It was non-stop saber-rattling from every outlet available. Why? Because defense contractors OWN the media. They stood to make a shit tonne of cash from dropping ordinance, truth be damned. If you already knew this, well, that&#39;s why they have to fake so much shit.</p>

<p>As for the moon landings, there certainly were some reasons to make the Russians believe we had done so, even if we didn&#39;t. So I think there were backup plans for the event that our mission(s) there failed. However, by all evidence, it appears we did in fact put a man on the moon and get him back home.</p>

<p>If there were good enough evidence to the contrary, please share it. I haven&#39;t seen it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As far as I understand on nuclear energy (roommate was a nuclear physicist and I studied the basics as a MechE), is that fission reactions are a lot tougher to stop and to cool then theoretical fusion reactions. Fission reactor rods are extremely hot, producing steam, which drives the turbines. They can be shut off safely in the event of an emergency, but the rods keep emitting heat so water still needs to be recycled. With that being said, there are tons of fail-safes in the event of a catastrophe. Fukishima was an older design and they were not able to keep the influx of water coming in, creating the disaster that it did. </p>

<p>As far as I&#39;m aware, fusion is much easier to control (granted with the right design), and can be stopped much quicker. This is from word of mouth knowledge though, and I haven&#39;t looked into it extensively.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>LRO imagery had a maximum resolution of 50cm/pixel while the image you provided has a resolution of 30cm (this is calculated after the orbital altitude is considered, so the LRO being closer to surface than the earth satellite does not mean it will have a higher resolution).</p>

<p>From the picture you supplied, I estimated one of the yachts is about 33 pixels long which results in a real life length of ~10 meters (matches up with average yacht size from a google search)</p>

<p>From <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b1/Apollo_12_landing_site_imaged_by_LRO%2C_2011.jpg">this picture</a>, the intrepid descent stage is about 16 pixels long, which results in a real life length of 8 meters while the Apollo module is actually 9.4m wide/long.</p>

<p>One explanation for the difference in resolution is that the LRO had many many other instruments and equipment (power has to be management and distributed between all of them), while satellites that only take images of the earth, only do that. Also, there is probably not enough incentive to send a satellite to the moon just to get a small increase in image resolution, as what we have now is sufficient.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Allen_radiation_belt">Wikipedia entry on the Van Allen Belts</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Apollo missions marked the first event where humans traveled through the Van Allen belts, which was one of several radiation hazards known by mission planners.[31] The astronauts had low exposure in the Van Allen belts due to the short period of time spent flying through them. <strong>Apollo flight trajectories bypassed the inner belts completely</strong>, and only passed through the thinner areas of the outer belts.[25][32]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Astronauts&#39; overall exposure was actually dominated by solar particles once outside Earth&#39;s magnetic field. <strong>The total radiation received by the astronauts</strong> varied from mission to mission but <strong>was measured to be between 0.16 and 1.14 rads (1.6 and 11.4 mGy), much less than the standard of 5 rem (50 mSv) per year set by the United States Atomic Energy Commission for people who work with radioactivity.</strong>[31]</p>

<p>As a radiation worker, I get about 2 rems per year (DDE, Deep Dose Equivalent, which measures radiation to the central mass). This is well acceptable. And it&#39;s understandable that they didn&#39;t receive that much. There are 3 main factors in radiation exposure: </p>

<ul>
<li>Time</li>
<li>Distance</li>
<li>Shielding</li>
</ul>

<p>By by-passing the inner belt, they avoided the most concentrated radiation exposure threat. The speed of travel gave them an advantage as well. Do you not believe these radiation exposure numbers provided? You think they made them up as well? Why not give a bigger number if they&#39;re just making it up?</p>

<p>&quot;The radiation dose in these belts is between 75 and 100 roentgen per second - but not more than 15 to 20 roentgen are acceptable per day. So the dose in the belts is lethal. This is the reason why the Soviets have objections against higher orbits.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The assumption above is based entirely on adequate shielding and estimates of radiation and time. The exterior of Saturn V would not likely have provided the adequate shielding. The shielding the lunar module had to block the radiation was a few sheets of aluminum foil (imagine building a fallout shelter with aluminum foil). Once past the belts and especially on the lunar surface, the space suits were even worse than the spacecraft. If the radiation from the Sun didn&#39;t spell doom for the astronauts, then the 200+ degrees of heat would have. </p>

<p>This is where some Bayesian logic comes in handy: is it more reasonable that NASA made the entire thing up, and all the accompanying lies and people who must lie in order to make that lie hold or did we actually go to the moon? </p>

<p>Again, I think we agree that NASA had backup plans to sell the idea of having been to the moon, in the event they failed. That, to me, is reasonable given the backdrop of nuclear war and the race for ICBMs. However, to have faked the moon video from any of these missions relies on the idea that many engineers, administration and general staff would have gone along with this plan. Aside from the technical difficulty of faking moon video footage, it&#39;s simply not believable that all these people would have played along.</p>

<p>Has there been anyone who was part of these missions break their silence on the moon landing and confess that it was all a hoax and that all the evidence for the missions was faked? </p>

<p>This is exactly the mentality that allows people to fall for all kinds of dumb shit. Just because a liar lies <em>doesn&#39;t</em> mean they cannot tell the truth about anything, ever. That is the primary mistake that &quot;all-or-nothing&quot; conspiracy theorists here make. They think because the govt lied about MKULTRA and 911 and JFK, that they must have lied about going to the moon. But that logic is faulty.</p>

<p>If only a liar <em>always</em> lied. Then it would be easy to tell truth from fiction. But real life, as you&#39;re well aware, doesn&#39;t work that way. The only way to sift the truth from the bullshit is to do the work. So, what evidence can you show that&#39;s strong enough to dismiss all the evidence for the moon landing? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>OR along similar lines, the motives have changed. Before anyone had been, there was international incentive to show other nations you could. Now that we know what&#39;s up there, incentive is to downplay our urgency to get back. </p>

<p>IOW, we&#39;ve been, we know what&#39;s worth farming. If we make a big show about flying up there every week, we&#39;d create a new space race with other nations competing for our resources.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t necessarily believe that, just playing devil&#39;s advocate for some of these &quot;this is the only possible explanation&quot; theories on here.</p>

<p>Edit: I agree that the recent talk of alien disclosure is just smoke in mirrors. Anything to prevent people from asking why we haven&#39;t been &quot;back&quot; to the moon or why all pictures of earth from space are CGI cartoons.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As far as I understand on nuclear energy (roommate was a nuclear physicist and I studied the basics as a MechE), is that fission reactions are a lot tougher to stop and to cool then theoretical fusion reactions. Fission reactor rods are extremely hot, producing steam, which drives the turbines. They can be shut off safely in the event of an emergency, but the rods keep emitting heat so water still needs to be recycled. With that being said, there are tons of fail-safes in the event of a catastrophe. Fukishima was an older design and they were not able to keep the influx of water coming in, creating the disaster that it did. </p>

<p>As far as I&#39;m aware, fusion is much easier to control (granted with the right design), and can be stopped much quicker. This is from word of mouth knowledge though, and I haven&#39;t looked into it extensively.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, and you know, capitalism. It&#39;s free PR. No big aerospace company wants to lose to a relatively new start-up  (granted that spaceX is not really a start-up now, but it&#39;s still new to the game). If they beat SpaceX, that means potentially new government contracts and more press. </p>
