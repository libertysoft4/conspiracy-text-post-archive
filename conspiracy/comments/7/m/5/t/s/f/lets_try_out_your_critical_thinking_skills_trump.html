        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>If you are genuinely here as a concerned citizen, I ask that you put aside your political beliefs just for this one time. Just be completely honest with yourself and answer this question: </p>

<p>Would any President Of The United States know 100% that there is no chance that the other members of the UN would vote to move the capital of Israel to Jerusalem? </p>

<p>Now Trump could be the dumbest person to ever walk the earth, but 100% his advisers would know from history that no way in hell would the UN vote to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. And Trump isn&#39;t that dumb either. </p>

<p>He knew damn well that the UN members WOULD NOT pass the vote to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. </p>

<p>So why did he do it? Why would he make a huge move like that knowing exactly the outcome? </p>

<p>Could have been any, none or all of these: </p>

<ol>
<li>He wanted to see who voted which way. </li>
<li>He wanted to bring an uprising against Israel, and he looks like the good guy. </li>
<li>So he can say he is on Israels side the next time they start to call him anti-semitic again. </li>
<li>To have a good reason to strip away money from a UN he already doesn&#39;t want to give money to. </li>
</ol>

<p>There could absolutely be other reasons, but one things for certain, he knew the UN members would say no. 4 seems the most likely to me, tbh. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Much appreciated, thanks. </p>

<p>I&#39;m going back to try and make sense of it and it&#39;s only causing me more confusion now. The first article I read prior today, I can&#39;t seem to relocate, but it surely worded it in a way that led me to my erroneous impression, to include that the US more or less just flat out stated that it was not gonna dish out $285mil from its own coffers, but now I see that that isn&#39;t an open-and-shut case. </p>

<p>With that said, I still can&#39;t get the numbers right, as this link shows that the US pays 22% of a total $5 bil UN budget:</p>

<p><a href="https://gdb.rferl.org/9D063E56-CED3-4D5E-9E16-9021ED1B878B.png">https://gdb.rferl.org/9D063E56-CED3-4D5E-9E16-9021ED1B878B.png</a></p>

<p>And this link states that the US alone spent 5-10 biliion in 2016:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.cfr.org/article/funding-united-nations-what-impact-do-us-contributions-have-un-agencies-and-programs">https://www.cfr.org/article/funding-united-nations-what-impact-do-us-contributions-have-un-agencies-and-programs</a></p>

<p>Add to that, I can&#39;t find a clear answer of whether they cut $285 mil on top of an already proposed $200 mil, for a total of $485 mil, or just $285 total. And if that is from the UN budget and not the US contrib, then that&#39;s not only far from 40% of the budget, it seems a drop in the bucket.</p>

<p>Regardless, there surely is a little more grandstanding from all parties, than not, I can see and/or completely not able to make sense of. The tryptophan and scotch-induced food coma isn&#39;t helping my cause at this point, either. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah it&#39;s very unclear at the moment. It&#39;s dick swinging all around to score browny points with the republican and Trump base.</p>

<p>The US negotiated a 285 million cut in addition to already 200 million cut proposed by the UN secretary Guterres. How that will translate into a shift in contributions isn&#39;t clear yet. </p>

<p>That 40% cut would put the US just barely the top contributor to the UN. And that would fit Trumps stance of stopping the US having to fund everything. </p>

<p>Since United States only attacks countries that can&#39;t defend themselves, NK becomes a dilemma. How to justify tens of thousands of dead American solders, cut in their prime for another looting war. This is where another event similar to 911 could be really useful to this administration, event that would anger Americans and insure steady supply of  meat to the military.</p>

<p>Israel wants war with Iran, but doesn&#39;t have the capability for continuous war with Iranians. If you haven&#39;t noticed, Israel is the one that calls all the shots, with this puppet and puppets before him. Plus, his son-in-law is close friends with Benjamin Netanyahu. Forget Russia, why isn&#39;t anyone talking about his relationship with Israel. Didn&#39;t Trump say that he is going to be most pro-Israel President ever? So when Israel decides to go war, do you think that US is going to just watch? </p>

<p>Israel is in the process of normalizing  relationships with countries in the Gulf, with Saudi Arabia in forefront of those countries. Saudis already threatened Hezbollah and Iran with war. Do you think that they would dare to threaten anyone without support of US?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d like to give you an opportunity to argue your point, unless it&#39;s just a dated all-eiite-are-zionist-shills opinion that you are offering. Could you provide any basis for your perspective and share it? </p>

<p>I&#39;ll give you a couple things that don&#39;t seem to jive with that:</p>

<p>Trump campaigned on peace in the Middle East, he&#39;s already showed to not lie about his other campaign promises and has already taken action on a lot of the big ones. So, you would have to argue that this is just a flat out lie, but that still doesn&#39;t show positive steps towards war with Iran. And, please, let&#39;s not make this political, I&#39;m just arguing what has occurred, on the record. And if you&#39;d like to tell me that what I just stated was factually incorrect, please show your work. </p>

<p>Also, and this one I&#39;d really like to know your stance on this one, do you think the current regime change in Saudi Arabia supports or detracts from your perspective.</p>

<p>Again, to be sure, I&#39;m not offended by your perspective, I&#39;d just like to give you the opportunity to help change my view.</p>

<p>Trump promised a lot of things, one of them was jobs. What happened to that? What happened to factories he promised to bring back? Only things he did was further enrich his wealthy class. 
His only concerns are Israel, wealthy, and further enlarging military-industrial complex.</p>

<p>Hate to brake it to you, but what you say in your comments isn&#39;t exactly groundbraking or original. In fact, it&#39;s rather generic and  indistinguishable from thousands of Trump supporters (with whom he wipes his orange buttocks on daily basis) plaguing Reddit since his appearance on political scene. All of you sound the same and all of you are on mission to attack anyone who disagrees with orange monkey. Do you have a manual from which you all copy and paste?</p>

<p>Of course they didn&#39;t vote against him, either, which would have been less than friendly gesture that would only have encouraged Trump to make those negotiations more difficult than they already are for them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Optics&quot;, pure and simple. The US Congress is on the record as having unanimously voted to make the move, so any political criticism within the US coming from members of either of the two major parties is simply sheer and blatant hypocrisy and any of Trump&#39;s opponents who can&#39;t resist using his decision to move the embassy against him are going to get called-out on it, not to mention becoming targets for the Jewish/Israeli/Zionista Lobby to go after and make life difficult for.</p>

<p>Trump also wants to cut the US subsidy to the UN and their unwillingness to go along and rubber stamp his decision, (which was a foregone conclusion), simply gives him an excuse to do it. It also gives him the opportunity cut US aid to any of the individual countries that happened to vote against him. As spiteful as that is and the utter disregard it has for whatever other countries consider to be in their own best interests that does two things... saves and is sop to the American taxpayers of anywhere from a half a billion to a billion dollars, and it fires a shot across the bow of the International globalists that they are now competing against the global ambitions of the US itself that in Trump&#39;s view is the only real agenda that matters. </p>

<p>Tump&#39;s way of saying &quot;You&#39;re either with us or agin&#39; us.&quot; meaning you either bow and kow-tow to the US Empire or get put on it&#39;s (s)hit lit. Now Trump can either relent due to the overwhelming consensus backed by International Law or he can go right a head and do it and thumb his nose at it. The point here is that he has the power to do it and that&#39;s, shall we say, a pretty powerful message all by itself. </p>

<p>You take note of Trumps &quot;Art of the Deal&quot; in which you establish and start from a position of power and demand more than you&#39;re willing to settle for, in order to negotiate/haggle for concessions as you lower the target from your initial demands. So what will they willingly concede to Trump in order for him to back-off on it and breathe a sigh of relief once he finally has?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>n his remarks, Trump noted that the Jerusalem Embassy Act of 1995 had &quot;passed Congress by an overwhelming bipartisan majority and was reaffirmed by a unanimous vote of the Senate only six months ago.&quot;</p>

<p>The 1995 law Trump cited mandated that the embassy be moved from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem by 1999. However, Palestinians also consider Jerusalem to be their capital, and the city has long been considered one of the stickiest points of contention for final-status negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians. Most other nations that have diplomatic relations with Israel have continued to locate their embassies in Tel Aviv.</p>

<p>For these reasons, past U.S. presidents from both parties have regularly signed waivers to suspend the move, amid fears it would destabilize peace talks.</p>
