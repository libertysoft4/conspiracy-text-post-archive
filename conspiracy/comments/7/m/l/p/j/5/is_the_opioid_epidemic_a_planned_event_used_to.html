Also we know that opium production has grown wildly since the Afghan war begin, is afghan opium used in American opiates? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I highly doubt this. As someone studying Food Science, a lot of cultures used to salt the shit out of their food in order to preserve it. They would often cook it in a soup to dilute the salt, but a lot of times they ate it straight up salted. You can even see people in South America commonly doing this today with salted beef. We didn&#39;t have heart attacks reported until the 18th century, and the practice of heavily salting foods was around for thousands of years. My family back home in Poland used to salt everything. They would eat lard and salt by itself, and this was common in their village and nobody every had heart problems and even weight problems were rare. I find it hard to believe that sodium consumption causes heart attacks. Nobody knows for sure what the biggest cause is, but it looks like oxidized polyunsaturated fatty acids rank high, which would make sense since the atrocious amounts of vegetable oils and deep fried foods that we consume means that oxidized PUFAs has increased proportionally to the heart disease epidemic. That and sugar and inactivity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well clearly you haven&#39;t gotten to sodium&#39;s effects in your Food Science study. Salt and the negative effects (especially black people) is heavily documented. It&#39;s not really up for debate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, it is a scientific approach to formulating food for optimal taste, texture, chemical and microbial stability, etc. Food scientists make all the food you see in stores and most restaurants, not chefs. </p>

<p>There have been no large scaled randomized controlled trials examining the effects of reduced sodium intake. There exists a lot of controversy over the effects of sodium intake and the science is far from settled. Our kidneys are extremely good at excreting excess sodium from high sodium intake and you are far more likely to experience negative side effects like lethargy from cutting salt then eating it as you normally would.</p>

<p>In &quot;Associations of urinary sodium excretion with cardiovascular events in individuals with and without hypertension: a pooled analysis of data from four studies&quot; a study involving 130,000 people from 49 countries, concluded that low-salt diets in people with and without high blood pressure may actually increase the risk of cardiovascular disease and death compared to average salt consumption.</p>

<p>And so the science is anything but settled and if anything, on the side of suggesting eating more salt. Once again, excreting excess salt is trivial for our kidneys, especially if we are reasonably well hydrated. It is just not feasible that this is a serious cause of heart attacks. This is yet another blunder by the health community that will end up making you less healthy, especially if you exercise or live in a hot environment. </p>

<p>The rate of new HIV infections in Portugal has fallen precipitously since 2001, the year its law took effect, declining from 1,016 cases to only 56 in 2012. Overdose deaths decreased from 80 the year that decriminalization was enacted to only 16 in 2012. In the US, by comparison, more than 14,000 people died in 2014 from prescription opioid overdoses alone.

    <div class="md"><p>The biggest reason for the opioid crisis is mass overuse of prescription opioids, which I&#39;d argue is part of a legal drug dealing infrastructure. And hey - whether it&#39;s Sketchy Bob on the street corner or some marketing exec in a nice office, business owners are going to try to maximize your market share.</p>

<p>&quot;But Purdue &amp; Friends lobbied the government, faked research, and bribed doctors!&quot; Yeah, they&#39;re trying to make money. Making money with addictive drugs involves deliberately trying to get as many people addicted as possible. That&#39;s what happens when you make drugs legal - big corporations are going to go &quot;Oh ho ho, I see an opportunity here!&quot;</p>

<p>When people think &quot;legalization,&quot; they need to stop thinking of poor old drug dealers going to prison. They need to think of the heroin version of Big Tobacco having the ability to market to hundreds of millions of people.</p>

<p>Legalization got us into this mess.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>, but people are too brainwashed </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Or know something about history. Are you familiar with the opium wars and the affect it had on China? Mass opium addiction was a <em>huge</em> factor in the collapse of China and directly or indirectly responsible for all the woes it faced during the early - mid 20th century. There&#39;s a reason the Chinese do not fuck around with drugs. It almost killed them as a nation. </p>

<p>China may well have been the asian power to industrialize, not  Japan, but they lost and opium was no small factor.  It was so widespread and devastating you had imperial officials looting coffers earmarked for modernization &amp; development to pay for their drug habits and all the nasty things that go along with it. </p>

<p>It boggles my mind that people who think pharmaceutical companies are basically Satan, essentially want to give them a free hand. Because that&#39;s exactly what will happen. If you think they&#39;re overprescribed and overused you ain&#39;t seen <em>nothing</em> yet.</p>

<p>That&#39;s not even touching on the security issues. Why bother with expensive social media manipulation and complicated psyops when China, Russia, etc. can just invest in big pharma and destroy society while making a tidy profit. May as well through the elites in there too. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’m not sure if the epidemic was “planned”, however I remember reading that since the invasion of Iraq and Afghanistan the production of poppy plants has risen considerably.  Poppy is a huge cash crop considering heroin is made from the plant. There was mention of Sadam Hussein giving subsidies to farmers to grow crops besides poppy plants, because of his religious beliefs and immense dislike for drugs. Once we came in and they had to spend money to fight us the farmers went back to what made them the most money, which was growing the poppy plant. American soldiers could destroy these fields, but then we risk angering the local populations and giving rise to more dislike of western intervention and more fuel for terrorist recruiting. So we let the farmers grow and sell it, and hope to catch the traffickers in later stages of production. However this has proven to be largely ineffective. </p>

<p>With the whole Oliver North scandal with the Contras and cocaine, our government has proven it’s capable and willing to sell drugs/allow the sale of drugs in order to fund the armament of rebel groups. The epidemic may not be the direct end game, but more of an acceptable by product of government agents profiting from the black market off-the-books money making scheme that are drug sales </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just checked out <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxycodone">Oxycodone</a> on Wikipedia, and it seems that the pills are synthesized from a different plant, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papaver_bracteatum"><em>Papaver bracteatum</em></a> in order to get the main ingredient, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thebaine">thebaine</a>.</p>

<p>I do believe the US allows Afganis to produce poppies to fuel the opiate trade worldwide, but in this case I think it&#39;s just a pharmaceutical company that saw their drugs were being abused and did nothing to stop it (that&#39;s the real conspiracy).</p>

<p>In 2007, Pudue Pharma (the pharmaceutical giant that makes Oxycontin) <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/id/18591525">was fined $634.5 million</a> &quot;for claiming the drug was less addictive and less subject to abuse than other pain medications&quot;.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, they just <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/oxycontin-class-action-1.4093781">settled a class action lawsuit in Canada for $20 million</a> for &quot;overmarketing&quot; the drug, and that &quot;that they were underreporting the addictiveness of the medication&quot;.</p>

<p>As if any of this wasn&#39;t clear enough, in October of this year <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/new-jersey-lawsuit-purdue-pharma-oxycontin-1.4380376">the State of New Jersey filed suit</a> alleging &quot;a &quot;direct link&quot; between the state&#39;s opioid crisis and the firm&#39;s deceptive marketing practices&quot;.</p>

<p>With all of these stories, you would think Purdue would take notice, and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-11-17/purdue-is-said-to-approach-states-in-bid-to-settle-opioid-claims">they have:</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Oxycontin maker <strong>Purdue Pharma LP is proposing a global settlement in an attempt to end state investigations and lawsuits over the U.S. opioid epidemic</strong>, according to people familiar with the talks.</p>

<p><strong>Purdue’s lawyers raised the prospect</strong> with several southern-state attorneys general who haven’t sued the company, <strong>as they try to gauge interest for a more wide-ranging deal</strong>, said four people who asked not to be identified because the talks aren’t public.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They know that they&#39;re guilty, so they&#39;re now trying to get out in front of the inevitable lawsuits that they will face, and ultimately lose. Given that Purdue is publicly traded, a corporation willingly giving out money that should be directed to their shareholders is a company that is trying to mitigate losses from confirmed, deceptive and illegal business practices.</p>

<p>To understand the driving force behind all of this, we first have to look at the basic facts:</p>

<ul>
<li>Opiates can be highly effective in treating pain, but are physically addictive</li>
<li>Oxycontin/codone (whatever you want to call it) was designed as an alternative to &quot;dangerous&quot; opiates, as it features a 12 hour time release</li>
<li>While this breakthrough was meant to mitigate overdoses and drug dependency, users quickly realized that if they crushed or chewed the tablets they could experience an intense high, given that all of the medicine was readily absorbed at once</li>
<li>This 12 hour pill was stronger than it&#39;s predecessors, because it was meant to slowly break down while releasing small amounts of opiates over a long time. When taken in crushed form, the intense high rivaled that of other opiates</li>
</ul>

<p>Taken on it&#39;s face this seems like a good solution to a real problem, with unintended consequences. <a href="http://www.latimes.com/projects/oxycontin-part1/">Think again</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Purdue has known about the problem for decades. Even before OxyContin went on the market, clinical trials showed many patients weren’t getting 12 hours of relief.</strong> Since the drug’s debut in 1996, the company has been confronted with additional evidence, including complaints from doctors, reports from its own sales reps and independent research.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The company has held fast to the claim of 12-hour relief, in part to protect its revenue. OxyContin’s market dominance and its high price — up to hundreds of dollars per bottle — hinge on its 12-hour duration</strong>. Without that, it offers little advantage over less expensive painkillers.</p></li>
<li><p>When many doctors began prescribing OxyContin at shorter intervals in the late 1990s, Purdue executives mobilized hundreds of sales reps to “refocus” physicians on 12-hour dosing. Anything shorter “needs to be nipped in the bud. NOW!!” one manager wrote to her staff.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Purdue tells doctors to prescribe stronger doses, not more frequent ones, when patients complain that OxyContin doesn’t last 12 hours</strong>. That approach creates risks of its own. Research shows that the more potent the dose of an opioid such as OxyContin, the greater the possibility of overdose and death.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>More than half of long-term OxyContin users are on doses that public health officials consider dangerously high</strong>, according to an analysis of nationwide prescription data conducted for The Times.</p></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Despite the fact that they knew there were problems with the drug, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/19/business/raymond-sackler-dead-of-purdue-pharma.html">Purdue still went hard trying to get it to market</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>OxyContin, introduced in 1995</strong>, was Purdue Pharma’s breakthrough palliative for chronic pain. Under a marketing strategy that Arthur Sackler had pioneered decades earlier, <strong>the company aggressively pressed doctors to prescribe the drug, wooing them with free trips to pain-management seminars and paid speaking engagements. Sales soared.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>To finish it off, in case anyone was wondering <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/10/30/the-family-that-built-an-empire-of-pain">why</a> Purdue would engage in such immoral practices:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Within five years of its introduction, OxyContin was generating a billion dollars a year. </p>

<p>The drug became a blockbuster, and <strong>has reportedly generated some thirty-five billion dollars in revenue for Purdue.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Money talks, and $35 billion dollars is apparently enough to overlook a drug that kills more people annually <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/6/6/15743986/opioid-epidemic-overdose-deaths-2016">than were lost during the entire Vietnam War</a>. To clarify, more Americans die annually from prescription drug overdoses (65,000) than were lost during the Vietnam War (58,000 US soldiers); this statistic doesn&#39;t take into account all of the Vietnamese and Cambodian deaths, for example.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Problem - reaction - solution to quote a phrase that is commonly used.</p>

<p>Know where these people get a lot of their strategies and tactics from?</p>

<p>Ancient Romans. They used to do the same exact thing - never let a crisis go to waste.</p>

<p>Another good example of a Roman tactic requires a bit more explaining. After conquering a region the native peoples weren&#39;t always entirely cooperative. So, one of the techniques the Roman&#39;s employed was to flood that particular area with other foreign peoples, essentially diluting the native base and &#39;removing&#39; the basis of their culture.</p>

<p>If you look at the mass immigrations in Europe from the middle east, the immigrants themselves aren&#39;t to blame necessarily, but the circumstances that created this situation can be traced backward and it could essentially be perceived as a parallel to said Roman tactic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We&#39;re not barbaric? I would like that to be the case.</p>

<p>The common person might care but those in power do not.</p>

<p>Human beings have not changed for thousands of years. We are the same as we were in 1,000 B.C.. It&#39;s why the &#39;Art of War&#39; collection can still be applied today, it&#39;s no different, regardless of guns or spears, the same concepts apply.</p>

<p>The day I see the common American realize where the actual power in this country is - despite the secret tech, secret plans, etc - if all Americans stand up one day and say, refuse to pay excess taxes, insist a foreign war stops or insists the corruption in the government stops then I&#39;ll agree with &#39;we&#39;re better&#39;.</p>

<p>One of the primary reasons why the United States is unusual and special is because the common people have the right to do what they ought. As long as these powers that shouldn&#39;t be are not afraid of the wrath of the common person then nothing will ever change and we collectively are no better.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the romans made they conquered people in to slaves</p>

<p>virtually the whole population of rome was owned by a small number of its wealthy citizens</p>

<p>one of the big problems of late western rome was the sheer number of slaves that they wealthy owned and their realization that their personal wealth made them more powerful then empire that they needed to serve</p>

<p>it made sense if you where wealthy to simply hire your own armies and make yourself a king instead of serving the empire from which you gained little</p>

<p>most romans did not even notice the collapse of rome till the conquests of justinian when he informed people who had been ethnically roman that they where no longer considered part of the empire due to the power of the ostragothic kings in italy </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;It seems to me that the opioid epidemic has been allowed to get to the point its reached for more reasons then just greed by the big pharma. 10 years ago the epidemic was just as bad but was tolerated by the DRs, insurances, cops, DEA and government why though?&quot;</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think it was as widely known how many people were dying and getting addicted 10 years ago and all the groups of people you cited have to prioritize their concerns. </p>

<p>Also, ppl really like to get high. I think this is often overlooked slightly when discussing conspiracy around the drug trade.  It&#39;s not like corruption surrounding a lot of other endevours.  People might smuggle diamonds or guns and a border guard or politician might look the other way, but they are not directly addicted to the product. A lot of people involved in things like I just mentioned may want the pay-off of helping to smuggle guns or diamonds, but don&#39;t want to get anywhere near the product and they aren&#39;t controlled through addiction. Drugs can do the opposite.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have a theory about this... China is sending fentanyl as a perverse drug war against the US. 1) The CIA is responsible for generating American heroin addicts to boost its budget. 2) Fentanyl kills the addict because overdoses are insanely common, especially if it&#39;s carfentanyl--a significantly more portent opioid that just about guarantees death, also produced namely by Chinese labs. </p>

<p>So... if China is spiking the CIA&#39;s heroin supply, it&#39;s effectively trying to cut off its black ops revenue by killing the addict.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is so painfully wrong I had to reply. The US (read: CIA) is <em>absolutely</em> waging an opiate war on its own soil. It did so with cocaine by starting cartels in S America to bring it up through bases throughout Central America, and finally into airports like Clinton&#39;s Mena airport. This is well documented enough and hell, Gary Webb lost his life reporting it. Come to think of it, part of the reason the US hated Cuba was because they refused to allow their air bases to be used for drug import/export.</p>

<p>Moving on to present day, heroin first comes in through pharmaceuticals manufactured in plants established in Pakistan. Pfizer made out like a bandit during this time and it may help explain the $43 million it gave in <del>bribes</del> campaign contributions. Opium then comes in through legal pills, and bootleg ones manufactured as vet (animal) meds. Pakistan also ships in the drugs through the ports, stuffed in things like rice, mangoes and soccer balls. It&#39;s likely able to clear through diplomatic status, as that can&#39;t be screened like normal cargo.  </p>

<p>It also comes in through the balkans, yes, as the US established many airport bases in places like Kosovo. And look who runs that country: a NATO-selected narco terrorist known not just for drugs, but trafficking in arms, humans, and organs. So yeah, it&#39;s not surprising <em>that</em> guy is amenable to the US flying drugs in and out. But hey, he&#39;s no different than many other drug lords-cum-politician that the US has installed over time. </p>

<p>If you look at the stats, you might see figures claiming that it&#39;s Mexico the US goes after when it comes to heroin. This is true... but the DEA only goes after them because they&#39;re the CIA&#39;s competition. Otherwise, you&#39;ll find countless articles detailing the FBI&#39;s frustration at multiple stings quashed at the highest level with Turkey drug runners. I forgot to mention their role in bringing in heroin but if you look up Fetullah Gulen&#39;s history you&#39;ll quickly discern his role in the opiod epidemic in the US.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely not! Trauma affects us <em>all</em>. Hence, calling excess a cause of drug abuse is a perfect example of correlation not equalling causation. One could equally say drug addiction is a sign of poverty. Both are true, but it is more that a drug addict is just as likely to come from wealth or poverty; still, neither is a cause. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude. I&#39;m clinically depressed and a drug addict but I have nothing traumatic to blame it on. I&#39;ve been this way since I was probably 11. My childhood was extremely privileged and most of my introduction to drugs can be accredited to abusing the extra spending money my parents used to give me.</p>

<p>Our nation&#39;s drug epidemic is the result of a need to cope and traumatic experiences some of the time, but excess and the glorification of drug culture are equally guilty where this is concerned. Just because your situation applies to you doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s the standard. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Please understand that trauma does not necessarily mean a specific event taking place in a moment of time. This is crucial to understand when speaking of trauma and addiction. There are fractal factors (reads badly) deeply woven into the general psyche that add to addiction so naming any one cause other than the general umberella of pain. Our society&#39;s glorification of excess leads to the chronic programming of always needing &quot;more&quot;. Society and that learned constant craving for nothing in and of itself is extremely traumatic. Another example is the fact that in the year 2017, establishments of mental illness diagnoses have soared for an obvious reason of hightened tension and emotional social climate. I am also not speaking from my situation alone but with the credentials of a BA in psychology with an emphasis in mental health counseling as well as quite literally hundreds of hours of personal research. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would venture to say that any recent increase in diagnoses of mental illness is probably more related to our society&#39;s romanticizing of mental illnesses (specifically anxiety and depression) than some collective rise in social tension. I&#39;m not trying to downplay the importance or severity of some of our current events, but we as people have experienced social turmoil throughout our history, and that probably won&#39;t change any time soon; so I don&#39;t think that the &quot;rise&quot; you&#39;re talking about is something that was obvious or easily predicted based on the factor of romanticizing disabilities, nor do I think it merits use of the word &quot;traumatic.&quot; But you&#39;re the expert. My only point was that wanting more of something isn&#39;t always related to traumatic experiences, some people just try drugs and like them too much. Some people have a genetic predisposition to addiction that others do not. I&#39;m trying, as a drug addict, to convince other addicts that it&#39;s not beneficial to focus on the trauma you&#39;ve endured if you want help or a change in your situation. I think that focusing on yourself as a person instead of on how terrible the human experience is will allow the person to stop trying to justify their drug use, something that nearly every addict does, as I&#39;m sure you&#39;re aware.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would say that this is partially true, it&#39;s the result of the war on drugs, which gives authority figures the ability to disrupt and incarcerate communities and those they deem dangerous. This is supported by those who do not see the degradation and overreach these laws/ideals create. Those who benefit from these laws want more bodies in their private prisons, while the government takes away their right to vote decreasing the chance of reform. Now, those targeted are low to middle class, slowly moving up the socio-economic ladder. If things don&#39;t change soon, high class citizens who are vocal about pro-legalization could also be affected to silence a reform movement. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I definitely think that lots of Afghan opium is ending up on America&#39;s streets in the form of heroin. They did the same shit during the Vietnam War. And it would not at all surprise me if there is some deliberate plan to just let the epidemic grow and grow and thin out the herd, so to speak. What have they got to lose? They make money off of it on both ends (selling it and busting people for using it). The mysterious part of it for us peasants, of course, is how is this being done, exactly, behind the scenes? What kind of illicit framework is in place, from the poppy fields all the way down to American users? Recovering heroin addict here, btw. Got clean finally last January by weaning with methadone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel like it&#39;s marginally less nefarious than crack. What we&#39;re seeing with heroin is in large part a byproduct of decades of deregulation of pharmaceutical industries, over prescribing of opioid painkillers and the fact that the US is one of two countries that allows direct to consumer marketing for prescription drugs (New Zealand is the other and they&#39;re preparing to ban it). </p>

<p>That said, there is also no doubt in my mind that the occupation of Afghanistan is contributing to supply in a major way. Actually, I think that&#39;s proven fact at this point. I suspect this is more like a happy accident for the ruling class. I don&#39;t think they deliberately kicked it off but they sure as shit don&#39;t care when poor people get poorer and start dying so they&#39;re definitely not going to try to fix it.</p>

The opium for most of the worlds pharma is grown in Tasmania Australia under extremely tight security by a private firm that contracts to all the major suppliers of opiate based and synthetic products , the opium scientifically cultivated is much higher grade than what’s on offer in Afghanistan. Fentanyl which is synthetic mainly coming now from China . 
Most of the heroin that’s in the US is now grown in Columbia , Peru and Mexico . 
Afghan heroin is mainly for Russia , Asia and European  markets . </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, what benefit is there for that to happen? As greedy and inhumane as certain corporations/big pharma/rich people can be, they still need the middle class and even the lower class, to make money off of. Destroying them doesn&#39;t do them any favors. Sure when those classes are struggling and down in the dumps they&#39;ll take advantage of that and/or look the other way and let it happen, and there have been cases of systematically ruining people for gain (mostly lower class - like you say, with crack), but the opioid epidemic is not the same.</p>

<p>Yes, big pharma/doctors push these drugs, and it helps fuel addiction. And yes, opium production went through the roof since we invaded Afghanistan (and started propping up drug lords, and obviously profiting from them too), but there&#39;s plenty of other factors that exist as well.</p>

<p>The biggest factor no one ever talks about in drug addiction, when they sit there and have their think tanks or group talks about &quot;why is this happening&quot;, or &quot;why do people get addicted&quot;, what never gets brought up: because drugs are fucking great. Opioids make you feel awesome, and that&#39;s extremely dangerous, especially given the side-effects. That awesome feeling is a good escape from mundane or shitty life for most people. So the answer isn&#39;t &quot;let&#39;s get these people off these drugs&quot;, it&#39;s &quot;find the root of the problem, and replace that need with something else&quot;. Unfortunately for many, and in today&#39;s day in age, that something else is usually chemical. Fortunately, in today&#39;s day in age, we can find natural and safer ways to give those fixes and good feels. But good luck getting big pharma and their lackeys behind that one.</p>

<p>My little bro Michaelangelo was in a car accident. They handed him pain killers like they were candy for way too long and then just cut him off and by then he was addicted.</p>

<p>He was a good kid in every way. When he couldn&#39;t take the withdrawl or pain he turned to heroin because it was cheap and easy to get. No one saw it coming.</p>

<p>I took him in and had him living with me to try and help get him cleaned up. Then he relapsed and bought some real fucked up shit with fentanyl. He died.</p>

<p>He was 21. </p>

<p>I didn&#39;t move a single thing in his room for almost a year. His skateboard sat next to the backdoor and I couldn&#39;t touch it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just checked out <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxycodone">Oxycodone</a> on Wikipedia, and it seems that the pills are synthesized from a different plant, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papaver_bracteatum"><em>Papaver bracteatum</em></a> in order to get the main ingredient, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thebaine">thebaine</a>.</p>

<p>I do believe the US allows Afganis to produce poppies to fuel the opiate trade worldwide, but in this case I think it&#39;s just a pharmaceutical company that saw their drugs were being abused and did nothing to stop it (that&#39;s the real conspiracy).</p>

<p>In 2007, Pudue Pharma (the pharmaceutical giant that makes Oxycontin) <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/id/18591525">was fined $634.5 million</a> &quot;for claiming the drug was less addictive and less subject to abuse than other pain medications&quot;.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, they just <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/oxycontin-class-action-1.4093781">settled a class action lawsuit in Canada for $20 million</a> for &quot;overmarketing&quot; the drug, and that &quot;that they were underreporting the addictiveness of the medication&quot;.</p>

<p>As if any of this wasn&#39;t clear enough, in October of this year <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/new-jersey-lawsuit-purdue-pharma-oxycontin-1.4380376">the State of New Jersey filed suit</a> alleging &quot;a &quot;direct link&quot; between the state&#39;s opioid crisis and the firm&#39;s deceptive marketing practices&quot;.</p>

<p>With all of these stories, you would think Purdue would take notice, and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-11-17/purdue-is-said-to-approach-states-in-bid-to-settle-opioid-claims">they have:</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Oxycontin maker <strong>Purdue Pharma LP is proposing a global settlement in an attempt to end state investigations and lawsuits over the U.S. opioid epidemic</strong>, according to people familiar with the talks.</p>

<p><strong>Purdue’s lawyers raised the prospect</strong> with several southern-state attorneys general who haven’t sued the company, <strong>as they try to gauge interest for a more wide-ranging deal</strong>, said four people who asked not to be identified because the talks aren’t public.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They know that they&#39;re guilty, so they&#39;re now trying to get out in front of the inevitable lawsuits that they will face, and ultimately lose. Given that Purdue is publicly traded, a corporation willingly giving out money that should be directed to their shareholders is a company that is trying to mitigate losses from confirmed, deceptive and illegal business practices.</p>

<p>To understand the driving force behind all of this, we first have to look at the basic facts:</p>

<ul>
<li>Opiates can be highly effective in treating pain, but are physically addictive</li>
<li>Oxycontin/codone (whatever you want to call it) was designed as an alternative to &quot;dangerous&quot; opiates, as it features a 12 hour time release</li>
<li>While this breakthrough was meant to mitigate overdoses and drug dependency, users quickly realized that if they crushed or chewed the tablets they could experience an intense high, given that all of the medicine was readily absorbed at once</li>
<li>This 12 hour pill was stronger than it&#39;s predecessors, because it was meant to slowly break down while releasing small amounts of opiates over a long time. When taken in crushed form, the intense high rivaled that of other opiates</li>
</ul>

<p>Taken on it&#39;s face this seems like a good solution to a real problem, with unintended consequences. <a href="http://www.latimes.com/projects/oxycontin-part1/">Think again</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Purdue has known about the problem for decades. Even before OxyContin went on the market, clinical trials showed many patients weren’t getting 12 hours of relief.</strong> Since the drug’s debut in 1996, the company has been confronted with additional evidence, including complaints from doctors, reports from its own sales reps and independent research.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The company has held fast to the claim of 12-hour relief, in part to protect its revenue. OxyContin’s market dominance and its high price — up to hundreds of dollars per bottle — hinge on its 12-hour duration</strong>. Without that, it offers little advantage over less expensive painkillers.</p></li>
<li><p>When many doctors began prescribing OxyContin at shorter intervals in the late 1990s, Purdue executives mobilized hundreds of sales reps to “refocus” physicians on 12-hour dosing. Anything shorter “needs to be nipped in the bud. NOW!!” one manager wrote to her staff.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Purdue tells doctors to prescribe stronger doses, not more frequent ones, when patients complain that OxyContin doesn’t last 12 hours</strong>. That approach creates risks of its own. Research shows that the more potent the dose of an opioid such as OxyContin, the greater the possibility of overdose and death.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>More than half of long-term OxyContin users are on doses that public health officials consider dangerously high</strong>, according to an analysis of nationwide prescription data conducted for The Times.</p></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Despite the fact that they knew there were problems with the drug, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/19/business/raymond-sackler-dead-of-purdue-pharma.html">Purdue still went hard trying to get it to market</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>OxyContin, introduced in 1995</strong>, was Purdue Pharma’s breakthrough palliative for chronic pain. Under a marketing strategy that Arthur Sackler had pioneered decades earlier, <strong>the company aggressively pressed doctors to prescribe the drug, wooing them with free trips to pain-management seminars and paid speaking engagements. Sales soared.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>To finish it off, in case anyone was wondering <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/10/30/the-family-that-built-an-empire-of-pain">why</a> Purdue would engage in such immoral practices:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Within five years of its introduction, OxyContin was generating a billion dollars a year. </p>

<p>The drug became a blockbuster, and <strong>has reportedly generated some thirty-five billion dollars in revenue for Purdue.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Money talks, and $35 billion dollars is apparently enough to overlook a drug that kills more people annually <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/6/6/15743986/opioid-epidemic-overdose-deaths-2016">than were lost during the entire Vietnam War</a>. To clarify, more Americans die annually from prescription drug overdoses (65,000) than were lost during the Vietnam War (58,000 US soldiers); this statistic doesn&#39;t take into account all of the Vietnamese and Cambodian deaths, for example.</p>

The worst is the ones that are still alive and have fried their serotonin responders so bad that they feel no emotions anymore, I&#39;ve seen cousins steal our grandparents rent money for a fix, gun point robberies on me and other family, my closest cousin that I played with every weekend growing up killing a 65 year old man while fleeing the scene of a crime.

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely not! Trauma affects us <em>all</em>. Hence, calling excess a cause of drug abuse is a perfect example of correlation not equalling causation. One could equally say drug addiction is a sign of poverty. Both are true, but it is more that a drug addict is just as likely to come from wealth or poverty; still, neither is a cause. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>all the medicines for &#39;recovery&#39; are worse than heroin.</p>

<p>methadone, suboxone, much much harder to quit. its seriously a trap, because your addicted twice as hard for twice as long of a withdrawal.</p>

<p>kratom is the best solution, thats why they are hunting it down now trying to make it illegal. </p>

<p>Its still longer withdrawal than heroin, but MUCH MUCH milder with about half the symptoms, and still shorter than suboxone or methadone.</p>

<p>Id still be hooked on subs if I didnt switch to kratom and quit from there.</p>
