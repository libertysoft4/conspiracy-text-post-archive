        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;ve started a subreddit dedicated to exploring the idea that God is using Trump to overthrow a truly Biblical evil that has taken over our government and beyond.  </p>

<p>Come post supporting evidence or discuss the notion over at <a href="/r/TrumpIsATrumpet">/r/TrumpIsATrumpet</a>!</p>

<p>Here&#39;s some of what I&#39;ve gathered so far: </p>

<p>As early as 2007, Christians have claimed to be receiving prophecy of a future Donald Trump presidency.  </p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFfFtq1fljY">&quot;Trump as a Trumpet&quot;</a> a prophecy from Kim Clement in 2007. </p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6YWLaAnTIY">Mark Taylor&#39;s Prophecy of a Donald Trump presidency</a> from 2011. </p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gJp-ATeD14">Mike Thompson&#39;s Vision of the Hand of God guiding Trump</a> from April 2016. </p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgVCRLfT590">An Indian Prophet claiming he saw a vision of Trump as President</a> from August 2016. </p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsQG6WzmuE8">Trump&#39;s Similarity to Biblical Figures and hints to him in Biblical Prophecy</a>. </p></li>
</ul>

<hr/>

<p>Many people believe the number &quot;7&quot; to be the divine number; a symbol from God that His hand is on something. In the bible it represents perfection.  </p>

<p>Trump has had a curiously improbable amount of 7&#39;s following him during his run and ascension to the United State&#39;s highest office. </p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://i.redd.it/k4m5itqsvgvx.png">On /pol/, a post with seven 7&#39;s asserted Trump would win the presidency</a> back in June. </p></li>
<li><p>Trump won the election with 304 EC votes: 3+0+4 = 7</p></li>
<li><p>Hillary had 227, giving him a 77 EC vote margin. </p></li>
<li><p>There were 7 faithless electors.</p></li>
<li><p>Trump won 7 of the key battle ground states. (OH, PA, NC, FL, MI, WI, IO). </p></li>
<li><p>Trump&#39;s birthday is June 14th, flag day, because Congress adopted the Stars &amp; Stripes banner on June 14th, 1<strong>777</strong></p></li>
<li><p>The year Trump took office was year 5<strong>777</strong> on the Jewish calendar. </p></li>
<li><p>On the day Trump took office he was 70 years, 7 months, and 7 days old.  </p></li>
<li><p>Trump&#39;s Supreme Court nominee, Judge Neil Gorsuch, wrote 777 opinions. </p></li>
<li><p>Trump&#39;s son in law Jared Kushner appointed to a position of power bought 666 Fifth Avenue.  The battle for humanity will take place there against the satanist illuminati cabal</p></li>
</ul>

<hr/>

<p>Other curiosities: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>The name &quot;Donald John Trump.&quot; Donald means &quot;Great chief, world mighty.&quot; &quot;John&quot; means &quot;God has shown favor.&quot;  Trump meaning &quot;Ranks above the rest.&quot;  DJT&#39;s name can be said to mean a mighty world ruler, upon whom God has shown favor, who ranks above the rest. </p></li>
<li><p>Trump was born on flag day</p></li>
<li><p>He was briefly a carpenter, at work for his father. 🛠</p></li>
<li><p>His father&#39;s name was Frederick Christ Trump. And his mother&#39;s was Mary. He is literally the son of Christ child of Mary. 😮😮😮😮</p></li>
<li><p>His ticket was &quot;Trump/Pence,&quot; phonetically similar to &quot;Trumpets.&quot; 🎺🎺🎺</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Does anybody have anything else to add to this list? Thoughts?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>is he?  no.  whatever that means.</p>

<p>does he have decorating symbolism that is trying to indicate this?  very much so.  to add to your list, the initials DJT are very Je-zeus-ian.  D - half of a circle, indicating division of the whole - we live in a dualist world, and he&#39;s an agent of dualism.  J - a straight line curving off phi-ly, indicating &quot;change in balance&quot;.  And T - a cross, indicating balance.  very much Jesus-y symbology, imo.  </p>

<p>Trump may be a vessel of divine direction, but probably not in the way you or he thinks. </p>

<p>Certainly, if Clinton had won, Harvey Weinstein would not have been taken down. And a lot of the current media trends in movies and elsewhere would not be getting nearly as much successful pushback. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nations have spiritual cups and they fill up with God&#39;s wrath as they sin against him.  America&#39;s cup is probably pretty full.  We get the rulers we deserve as a nation.  Trump went to a Jesuit school.  He is working with the Vatican to move us closer to the beast&#39;s system.  This is of course all within the will of God, he already told us how it all ends so it&#39;s going to happen no matter what we do.  The only way out of here is being in Jesus Christ&#39;s body by repenting and believing his Gospel.</p>

<p>1Co 15:1  Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; 
1Co 15:2  By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. 
1Co 15:3  For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; 
1Co 15:4  And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures: </p>

<p>We are all sinners.  God hates sin.  The only way to be washed clean is to accept the blood atonement God himself did for you when he came to earth in the flesh to give himself up as a perfect sacrifice for sin.  His blood washes you clean.  Nothing you do yourself can save you.  Only grace by faith alone is what God already did for you.  It&#39;s so simple and the main truth this world is trying to hide.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As I&#39;ve posted in other threads. Trump is not here to save the people, just as Hillary wasn&#39;t, just as Bernie or Jill stein weren&#39;t. NONE OF THEM CARE ABOUT US, THE PEOPLE. NONE OF THEM ARE HERE TO SAVE US FROM THE EVILS OF THE WORLD. that&#39;s our job, as individuals and a collective. We need to raise up our consciousness as a people and break the programming that has taught us that hate, not love is the answer. Love is the only answer, and it&#39;s how we get out of this mess.  </p>
