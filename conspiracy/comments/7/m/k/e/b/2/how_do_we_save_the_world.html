        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>With all the conspiracies, with everything going on in the world, all of us must be feeling somewhat heavy when we browse this sub.</p>

<p>It seems like suffering is on every corner. Everywhere you look, there is corruption and unconsciousness. Even though an awakening seems to be happening, one wonders if it&#39;s enough, or if it will happen in time.</p>

<p>So you keep digging, researching and spreading awareness. Until you start getting really tired. And then, to top it off,  you see for the millionth time, that highly upvoted thread on the main page. That thread filled with propaganda, with fearmongering, filled with people that just don&#39;t care. People that don&#39;t want peace, people that want war, that want to hunt down the “bad guys”. People with no empathy or regard for human life. </p>

<p>Recently there have been many threads on Russia popping up and the comments were filled with people pushing for war, pushing for violence, literally filled with hatred for the Russians (yes, not only the leaders, the people as well). People claiming that the Russians created the Trump presidency. My God people, even if the allegations against Russia were somehow true, it is ultimately the US that, for better or worse, voted in Trump. </p>

<p>It&#39;s fascinating to me how people love war, love conflict. Do people have any idea what war is like? And no, playing Call of Duty does not count as war-time experience.</p>

<p>It seems to me people don&#39;t really see. They are just blinded with a fog over their minds. They don&#39;t see the human in the other, they only see labels. Liberals, conservatives, Russians, Muslims, blacks, whites, Jews, the Chinese...etc. ad infinitum. And those labels are all they see. Those aren&#39;t beings, living beings. They are reduced to mental labels.</p>

<p>We label everyone and everything. Even the animals. We justify the horrifying conditions animals are kept in, the factory farms, the torture for scientific purposes...simply because we ultimately do not see them as living beings. We only see our pets as living beings. That&#39;s where it usually stops for most people.</p>

<p>It almost seems as if a form of psychopathy, which fundamentally is a lack of empathy, is quite prevalent in our society. It seems that for many, it is this selective reasoning, where we can feel compassion for our family, yet feeling it for our neighbour, or God forbid, for the evil communists is a step too far. It is outside of our comfort zone. </p>

<p>&quot;<em>The people of western countries have more compassion than at any time in history, but there has to be a line drawn somewhere when compassion actively hinders prosperity.</em>&quot; I heard a recent commenter say in a thread about Russia.</p>

<p>Really? </p>

<p>Does anyone realize that compassion is one of the fundamentals of mental health, of happiness itself, as well as the foundation of healthy human relations? Do people realize just how much joy and peace actual compassion can bring? And on top of that, how much it can help our society? Does anyone realize what kind of a world we will be living in if compassion and empathy become non-existent?</p>

<p>So we come to the real problem. The real problem is our pain. This is why we lack compassion. We avoid ourselves, thus not even knowing we are still alive. We distract ourselves. We live in the society of the spectacle.</p>

<p>Because of this we become dead inside. If you do not know who you are, if you cannot even feel your feelings, if you are cut off from yourself – you cannot empathize with anyone. You cannot have healthy relationships. And you cannot expect to have inner peace. You cannot create a functional society on a basis of no empathy, of inner deadness.</p>

<p>How can you expect to function in a society with other beings in a normal manner? How can we expect this society to function if we are all dead inside?</p>

<p>We must look within and face our pain. We must come to ourselves and thus come to our senses. </p>

<p>If you allow yourself to be present, right now, dropping the past and future for just a moment, you will see. You will notice a peace, a stillness, a lightness, a softness.</p>

<p>But because you have been away from your inner home for so long, you will also feel your accumulated pain. Embrace it, love it, breathe through it. Allow yourself to really feel it and do not get trapped into the thoughts that it spins in your mind. Then look deeply into it and try to understand it. See the source of it, the cause of it. See what wrong perception you may have, question them. Question your beliefs, your assumptions. If action is needed, take it. Take it by using reason and intuition. If you embrace and dissolve your inner pain you will come to clarity and you will know how to act in a much more efficient and productive manner.</p>

<p>Beneath all the pain you may have, there is peace, there is freedom. You will see this is the case for yourself. For now you will simply have to trust me, but ultimately you must prove this to yourself, otherwise it won&#39;t work. You cannot let this be something you either believe or disbelieve. You must prove to yourself that there is peace beyond ALL and ANY pain. That you can be free NO MATTER WHAT.</p>

<p>Why are simple processes like this, simple meditations, simple ways of centering yourself, not taught in school? In kindergarten even? Why can we not handle our emotions? Why does nobody tell us that primary contentment comes form within? Is it because a society of drones that need to be hyped up on pharmaceutical drugs and propped up in front of a TV to get that dopamine high is easier to control? </p>

<p>Even if we drop any conspiracy aspect of this and simply see it as <em>the blind leading the blind</em> (and ultimately, I would say that any psychopaths in power are quite blind in that sense), we must see that this is important to us. It is important for the preservation of our society. </p>

<p>It is important to look within. It is important because the inner precedes the outer. Our thoughts come before our actions. And our inner world decides our thoughts. So how can we express productive, positive action if we are distracted from our inner experience and allow it to be polluted?</p>

<p>I encourage you all to look within. To face and embrace your pain. If you can find at least a tiny bit more of inner peace, just a smidgen, your actions and life will be much more proactive and productive. You will be able to help everyone better and spread awareness better on the topics you know matter.</p>

<p>Do not fear your feelings. Use your breath to steady yourself and face your pain. In the light of your awareness you will see that you are dealing with mere phantoms. There may be many feelings, but you can handle anything that is set on your path. You are freedom!</p>

<p>Much love to you all and best wishes in the coming new year.</p>

<p>The only thing I&#39;d change, is the title. It&#39;s not about saving the world, per se, it&#39;s about saving yourself in order to help those you love and care for.  Your spirit being chose to be here, at this point in time for a reason. We either ascend or descend in the Astral realm. The goal is to ascend, and you do it by doing the very things you&#39;ve talked about.</p>

<p>Peace and love!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes I am in full agreement :) </p>

<p>But I wanted the title to reflect it more broadly. To me, while I obviously care about those closest to me the most, I love and care about this crazy world and all the creatures on it as well. </p>

<p>Humanity and this planet can be so dumb at times, but I still love them. And I want this place to rock, you know? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>For what its worth, I find myself asking this question from two vantage points: the heart, and the mind. The answers I get from those two places are different. From the heart I get love, patience, acceptance, forgiveness, which fits in with your post. From the mind I get layers upon layers of strange and implausible misdirections, as if to solve a puzzle by shredding the pieces in a billion bits and throwing them into a tornado before you can painstakingly re-locate every bit&#39;s original place in the puzzle, but the picture of the puzzle is now the opposite of what it was when you started playing.</p>

<p>Indeed. When I began to open my eyes and accept that most &#39;conspiracy&#39; or &#39;save the world&#39; type people can&#39;t even eat properly or cut back on their own drug use, I realised that this is <em>just how things are</em>.</p>

<p>Make peace with the world the way it is because nobody here is about to change it.</p>

<p>If you can&#39;t save yourself you have no hope of saving the world. That is the reality.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m a truth seeker. Always have been. But there&#39;s a problem being a truther. Were humans. And humans have feelings and emotions and egos and everything else that make humans venerable...you cant have mental illness without a functioning mind. Ill get back to that.</p>

<p>A little backstory about my situation first. Now I realize I&#39;ve been in an interesting situation lately. This fall was my first semester in college. 1000 miles away from home. And I had no one. No one out there I care about. No one who cares about me. All I had was time and myself. So I started to do research. I had more time to dig around for the truth. So I did. And I enjoy every minute of it. And not just like watch loose change and think I&#39;m woke type research. Real research. Digging. Reading hundreds of government papers a day. Learning. At this point I would consider myself a very well versed &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; as much as I hate the word. I don&#39;t know everything. But I learned how to do real meaningful research. Than something Interesting happened. </p>

<p>October first. I get a call from an ex of mine at like 1 in the morning. She&#39;s balling her eyes out and I had no clue what happened. All she could get out was &quot;his head just exploded&quot;.  I tried to calm her down but she hung up. I looked up the news that night and I saw one article that said &quot;2 dead and more injured in Las Vegas concert shooting&quot;. This was sad yes. What&#39;s even more sad is it was normal. I went to sleep. I woke up the next morning by a text from my mom. &quot;everyone&#39;s ok&quot;.  Turn on my tv. &quot;40 dead and 400 injured in Las Vegas massacre&quot;. This blew my mind. This is a different story. Now that next day was entirely unproductive. Phone call after phone call. I&#39;m a thousand miles away from home and they are dealing with the &quot;deadliest mass shooting in history&quot;.  The next day I started my research. </p>

<p>I had an hour and a half of police scanner transcribed. I made calls to my Vegas police friends. My friend in the swat, my friends in the military, and anyone else in Vegas I could try and get any info from. And needless to say the story didn&#39;t add up. It drove me crazy. The lies. The truth. It can ruin a man. The truth hurts. We are trained to be blind little sheep. But a couple red pills and you awaken. We become woke and open our eyes and we realize were standing there face to face with the devil and his army of demons.</p>

<p>No wonder the sheeple seem happier. Im starting to think they actually are.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some details I would like to share. What I say Is true to the best of my knowlege.</p>

<p>But Rylie Golgart was injured in it. Look her up. She got &quot;shot in the back&quot;. I went to middle school with her. She is a real person. That being said I havent personally seen a bullet hole. </p>

<p>Quinten Is one of the deceased. I believe he was my cousins homecoming group. As far as I know real person. </p>

<p>And Charelson Was the cop who died. Apparantly his son goes to the highschool I went to.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This was a very interesting read. Thanks for sharing. I feel like knowledge can truly be hard to bear sometimes. </p>

<p>I feel like you have to balance information with awareness and knowledge about the world with inner clarity in peace. To me, I was able to accept the world as it is much better through the help of various meditative and introspective practices.</p>

<p>Because there are some things you cannot change or influence in a significant degree, so it is simply better to not pollute your inner world with negativity. Allowing things to be as they are and coming to a deeper peace within also helps you find ways to help people better and creates an expression of more productive action. Then you can simply do as you can, as best you can, to help the world. </p>

<p>I&#39;d also say that already coming to more peace within helps the world through every action you take, as now you become a carrier of presence.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Insight on the horrors of the world must always be coupled with inner practices that lead to peace, otherwise one can go pretty mad.</p>

<p>But if they are combined, instead of madness, compassion, insight and awareness arise.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the best way to add peace and positivity to one&#39;s life is to remove obstacles to it. If you let go of your inner demons, your fears, anger, pain...peace and positivity arise naturally in my experience.</p>

<p>And I&#39;ve found that sometimes it&#39;s a good idea to stop thinking for a while. The mind is constantly running and it needs a rest. That&#39;s what meditative practices are here for in my opinion.</p>

<p>You stop thinking for a while and you see you can be at greater peace without your thoughts. Then you resume thinking whenever it&#39;s needed. Whenever you need to think. </p>

<p>Of course this is easier said than done, but slowly one can quiet the mind and regain control of it. Otherwise the mind rules you and not the other way around (and that is still the case with pretty much all of us to be fair, but slowly we can shift that I&#39;d say).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, it begins with just small actions like helping someone feel better. Giving someone a hug or forgiving yourself for the mistakes you made. It&#39;s about progress. We&#39;re all really messed up, but some of it isn&#39;t our faults. Things happen to us and we have to learn to accept that what we do and what we become is not entirely our own machinations. To save the world, we must first save ourselves, then save each other, and then save the world.</p>

<p>This comes through love and understanding. We must erase the fear by becoming informed. We must erase the hate through compassion.</p>

<p>It is not too late for any of us to change. The road of redemption is hard for some and easy for others, but anyone, no matter how evil, can redeem themselves. The light within us all is there. And that&#39;s what we have to learn, to balance both darkness and light, to achieve a state of existence that allows for growth.</p>

<p>People are watching me and I&#39;m a little scared. But I&#39;ll try my best to follow my own advice and help.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not everybody think the world should be saved. By the world I mean Humans. Being empathic everyday is going for madness since we still live in the idea of competition, money, and survival, just because 1% of us decide to control all the resources. Sometimes like many others I would gladly watch the whole planet burn in gigantic fires. It&#39;s normal to have these feelings. They don&#39;t define my true self. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m a truth seeker. Always have been. But there&#39;s a problem being a truther. Were humans. And humans have feelings and emotions and egos and everything else that make humans venerable...you cant have mental illness without a functioning mind. Ill get back to that.</p>

<p>A little backstory about my situation first. Now I realize I&#39;ve been in an interesting situation lately. This fall was my first semester in college. 1000 miles away from home. And I had no one. No one out there I care about. No one who cares about me. All I had was time and myself. So I started to do research. I had more time to dig around for the truth. So I did. And I enjoy every minute of it. And not just like watch loose change and think I&#39;m woke type research. Real research. Digging. Reading hundreds of government papers a day. Learning. At this point I would consider myself a very well versed &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; as much as I hate the word. I don&#39;t know everything. But I learned how to do real meaningful research. Than something Interesting happened. </p>

<p>October first. I get a call from an ex of mine at like 1 in the morning. She&#39;s balling her eyes out and I had no clue what happened. All she could get out was &quot;his head just exploded&quot;.  I tried to calm her down but she hung up. I looked up the news that night and I saw one article that said &quot;2 dead and more injured in Las Vegas concert shooting&quot;. This was sad yes. What&#39;s even more sad is it was normal. I went to sleep. I woke up the next morning by a text from my mom. &quot;everyone&#39;s ok&quot;.  Turn on my tv. &quot;40 dead and 400 injured in Las Vegas massacre&quot;. This blew my mind. This is a different story. Now that next day was entirely unproductive. Phone call after phone call. I&#39;m a thousand miles away from home and they are dealing with the &quot;deadliest mass shooting in history&quot;.  The next day I started my research. </p>

<p>I had an hour and a half of police scanner transcribed. I made calls to my Vegas police friends. My friend in the swat, my friends in the military, and anyone else in Vegas I could try and get any info from. And needless to say the story didn&#39;t add up. It drove me crazy. The lies. The truth. It can ruin a man. The truth hurts. We are trained to be blind little sheep. But a couple red pills and you awaken. We become woke and open our eyes and we realize were standing there face to face with the devil and his army of demons.</p>

<p>No wonder the sheeple seem happier. Im starting to think they actually are.</p>
