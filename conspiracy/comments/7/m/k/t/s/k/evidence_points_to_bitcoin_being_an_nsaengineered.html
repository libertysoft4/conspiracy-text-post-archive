        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><a href="http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/imagenes_sociopol2/globalbanking555_01.jpg">Eye</a></p>

<p>I&#39;m going to assume the readers who make it to this article are well informed enough that I don&#39;t have to go into the history of the global money changers and their desire for a one world currency.</p>

<p>(If you don&#39;t yet understand the goal of the <a href="http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/sociopolitica/sociopol_globalbanking.htm">globalist banking empire</a> and the coming engineered collapse of the fiat currency system, you&#39;re already about 5,000 posts behind the curve.)</p>

<p>With that as a starting point, it&#39;s now becoming increasingly evident that <a href="http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/sociopolitica/sociopol_globalbanking.htm#BitCoin">Bitcoin</a> may be a creation of <a href="http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/sociopolitica/sociopol_nsa.htm">the NSA</a> and was rolled out as a &quot;normalization&quot; experiment to get the public familiar with digital currency.</p>

<p>Once this is established, the world&#39;s fiat currencies will be obliterated in an <a href="http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/sociopolitica/sociopol_globalbanking.htm#Economic_Collapse">engineered debt collapse</a> (see below for the sequence of events), then replaced with a government approved cryptocurrency with tracking of all transactions and digital wallets by the world&#39;s western governments.</p>

<p><strong>NSA mathematicians detailed &quot;digital cash&quot; two decades ago</strong></p>

<p>What evidence supports this notion?</p>

<p>First, take a look at this document entitled, &quot;<a href="http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/archivos_pdf/how-to-make-a-mint.pdf">How to Make a Mint - The Cryptography of Anonymous Electronic Cash.</a>&quot; This document, released in 1997 - yes, <strong><em>twenty</em> years ago</strong> - detailed the overall structure and function of Bitcoin cryptocurrency.</p>

<p>Who authored the document?</p>

<p>Try not to be shocked when you learn it was authored by,</p>

<pre><code>&quot;mathematical cryptographers at the National Security Agency&#39;s Office of Information Security Research and Technology.&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>The NSA, in other words, detailed key elements of Bitcoin long before Bitcoin ever came into existence.</p>

<p>Much of the Bitcoin protocol is detailed in this document, including signature authentication techniques, eliminating cryptocoin counterfeits through transaction authentication and several features that support anonymity and untraceability of transactions.</p>

<p>The document even outlines the <em>heightened risk of money laundering</em> that&#39;s easily accomplished with cryptocurrencies. It also describes &quot;secure hashing&quot; to be &quot;both one-way and collision-free.&quot;</p>

<p>Although Bitcoin adds mining and a shared, peer-to-peer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain">blockchain</a> transaction authentication system to this structure, it&#39;s clear that the NSA was researching cryptocurrencies long before everyday users had ever heard of the term.</p>

<p>Note, too, that the name of the person credited with founding Bitcoin is <strong>Satoshi Nakamoto</strong>, who is reputed to have <a href="https://bitslog.wordpress.com/2013/04/17/the-well-deserved-fortune-of-satoshi-nakamoto/">reserved one million Bitcoins for himself</a>.</p>

<p>Millions of posts and online threads discuss the possible identity of Satishi Nakamoto, and <a href="https://bittox.com/2017/09/02/nsa-identified-satoshi-nakamoto/">some posts even claim the NSA has identified Satoshi</a>.</p>

<p>However, another likely explanation is that <em>Satoshi Nakamoto</em> <strong>is the NSA</strong>, which means he is either working for the NSA or is a sock puppet character created by the NSA for the purpose of this whole grand experiment.</p>

<p><strong>The NSA also wrote the crypto hash used by Bitcoin to secure all transactions</strong></p>

<p>On top of the fact that the NSA authored a technical paper on cryptocurrency long before the arrival of Bitcoin, the agency is also <em>the creator of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2">SHA-256</a></em> hash upon which every Bitcoin transaction in the world depends.</p>

<p>As <a href="https://thehackernews.com/2013/09/NSA-backdoor-bitcoin-encryption-sha256-snowden.html">The Hacker News</a> (THN) explains.</p>

<pre><code>&quot;The integrity of Bitcoin depends on a hash function called **SHA-256**, which was designed by the NSA and published by the *National Institute for Standards and Technology* ([NIST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institute_of_Standards_and_Technology)).&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>THN also adds:</p>

<pre><code>&quot;If you assume that the NSA did something to SHA-256, which no outside researcher has detected, what you get is the ability, with credible and detectable action, they would be able to forge transactions.



The really scary thing is somebody finds a way to find collisions in SHA-256 really fast without brute-forcing it or using lots of hardware and then they take control of the network.&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>Cryptography researcher <strong>Matthew D. Green</strong> of Johns Hopkins University <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/blog/what-do-the-latest-nsa-leaks-mean-for-bitcoin">said</a>.</p>

<p>In other words, if the SHA-256 hash, which was created by the NSA, actually has a backdoor method for cracking the encryption, it would mean the NSA could steal everybody&#39;s Bitcoins whenever it wants (call it &quot;Zero Day.&quot;)</p>

<p>That same article, written by <strong>Mohit Kumar</strong>, mysteriously concludes,</p>

<pre><code>&quot;Even today it&#39;s too early to come to conclusions about Bitcoin. Possibly it was designed from day one as a tool to help maintain control of the money supplies of the world.&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>And with that statement, Kumar has indeed stumbled upon the bigger goal in all this:</p>

<pre><code>To seize control over the world money supply as the fiat currency system crumbles and is replaced with a one-world *digital currency controlled by globalists*.
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Think cryptography is bulletproof? Think again…</strong></p>

<p>Lest you think that the cryptography of cryptocurrency is secure and bulletproof, consider this article from <em>The Hacker News</em>, &#39;<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2017/07/gnupg-libgcrypt-rsa-encryption.html">Researchers Crack 1024-bit RSA Encryption in GnuPG Crypto Library</a>,&#39; which states,</p>

<pre><code>&quot;The attack allows an attacker to extract the secret crypto key from a system by analyzing the pattern of memory utilization or the electromagnetic outputs of the device that are emitted during the decryption process.&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>Note, importantly, that this is a <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/132184/article.html">1024-bit encryption system</a>.</p>

<p>The same technique is also said to be able to crack 2048-bit encryption. In fact, encryption layers are cracked on a daily basis by clever hackers.</p>

<p>Some of those encryption layers are powering various cryptocurrencies right now. Unless you are an extremely high-level mathematician, there&#39;s no way you can know for sure whether any crypto currency is truly non-hackable.</p>

<p>In fact, every cryptocurrency becomes <strong>obsolete</strong> with the invention of large-scale <a href="http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/ciencia/ciencia_quantum.htm#Quantum_Computer">quantum computing</a>.</p>

<p>Once China manages to build a working 256-bit quantum computer, it can effectively steal all the Bitcoins in the world (plus steal most national secrets and commit other global mayhem at will).</p>

<p>(<a href="https://vimeo.com/231594458"><strong>Video</strong>)</a></p>

<p><strong>Ten steps to crypto-tyranny - The &quot;big plan&quot; by the globalists (and how it involves Bitcoin)</strong></p>

<p>In summary, here&#39;s <em>one possible plan by the globalists</em> to seize total control over the world&#39;s money supply, savings, taxation and financial transactions while enslaving humanity.</p>

<p>And it all starts with Bitcoin...</p>

<ol>
<li><pre><code>    Roll out the NSA-created Bitcoin to get the public excited about a digital currency.
</code></pre></li>
<li><pre><code>   Quietly prepare a globalist-controlled cryptocurrency to take its place. (JP Morgan, anyone...?)
</code></pre></li>
<li><pre><code>   Initiate a massive, global-scale [false flag operation](http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/sociopolitica/sociopol_falseflag.htm) that crashes the global debt markets and sends fiat currencies down in flames (hoax alien invasion, hoax North Korean EMP attack, mass distributed power grid terrorism network, etc.)
</code></pre></li>
<li><pre><code>   Blame whatever convenient enemy is politically acceptable (North Korea, &quot;the Russians,&quot; Little Green Men or whatever it takes…)
</code></pre></li>
<li><pre><code>   Allow the fiat currency debt pyramid to collapse and smolder until the sheeple get desperate.
</code></pre></li>
<li><pre><code>   With great fanfare, announce a government-backed cryptocurrency replacement for all fiat currencies, and position world governments as the SAVIOR of humanity. Allow the desperate public to trade in their fiat currencies for official crypto currencies.
</code></pre></li>
<li><pre><code>   [Outlaw cash](http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/sociopolitica/sociopol_globalbanking.htm#Cashless_Society) and *criminalize gold and silver ownership by private citizens*. All in the name of &quot;security,&quot; of course.
</code></pre></li>
<li><pre><code>   Criminalize all non-official cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, crashing their value virtually overnight and funneling everyone into the one world government crypto, where the NSA controls the blockchain. This can easily be achieved by blaming the false flag event (see above) on some nation or group that is said to have been &quot;funded by Bitcoin, the cryptocurrency used by terrorists.&quot;
</code></pre></li>
<li><pre><code>   Require [embedded RFID](http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/ciencia/secret_projects/implants.htm#RFID) or biometric identifiers for all transactions in order to &quot;authenticate&quot; the one-world digital crypto currency activities. *Mark of the Beast* becomes reality. No one is allowed to eat, travel or earn a wage without being marked.
</code></pre></li>
<li><pre><code>   Once absolute control over the new one-world digital currency is achieved, weaponize the government-tracked blockchain to track all transactions, investments and commercial activities. Confiscate a portion of all crypto under the guise of &quot;automated taxation.&quot; In an emergency, the government can even announce *negative interest rates* where your holdings automatically decrease each day.
</code></pre></li>
</ol>

<p>With all this accomplished, globalists can now roll out absolute totalitarian control over every aspect of private lives by enforcing financial &quot;blackouts&quot; for those individuals who criticize the government.</p>

<p>They can put in place <strong>automatic deductions</strong> for traffic violations, vehicle license plate taxes, internet taxes and a thousand other oppressive taxes invented by the bureaucracy.</p>

<p>With automatic deductions run by the government, citizens have no means to halt the endless confiscation of their &quot;money&quot; by totalitarian bureaucrats and their deep state lackeys.</p>

<p>How do you feel about your Bitcoin now...?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is one thing to create one currency to rule them all. It is another thing to open pandora&#39;s (open source) box and lay the grounds for thousands and thousands competing global currencies... If Bitcoin was the only one and it was forced upon us I would easily agree.</p>

<p>There are currencies like Ripple and Bitcoin (legacy) that are already captured by the current money elite. But there are others that are able to vastly improve society.</p>

<p>It now depends on the masses to decide if they want to use pre-manufactured slave money be it in the form of digital money or fiat money or if they choose self-sovereign money that helps create a better society.</p>

<p>If you can&#39;t see, that crypto currencies are just a tool. And that they have the power to end your serfdom it might not be the right time yet to leave the role of the victim.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you! I did not expect that.</p>

<p>But i think we have a bit of a misunderstanding here. I am not against cryptocoins, even with it&#39;s many known technical flaws which i hope will be solved in the near future.</p>

<p>Even the possibility to just create a new one is incredible. But all cryptocoins depend on the trust the public gives them. They have no intrinsic value at all. If governments decide to prohibit one or the other kind of them, then enterprises using them could/will be punished by whatever government feels responsible. What sense that it has if you cannot spend them and the only reason to posses them is speculation?</p>

<p>Countries depend very much on the value of their currency. The stability of their economies depends very much on their capability to pay their debts and borrowing money from other countries. If another inofficial currency is used in their markets, the local currency could deflate and that would for sure force the government to fight the use of cryptocurrency and limit it to the black market. Which is even worse for the currency.</p>

<p>Cryptocoins are highly valued now only because they are being seen right now as a great speculation object. You can barely buy anything in Bolivia with cryptocoins but it is a nice investment to have them. Till the bubble bursts.</p>

<p>Also buying and selling with cryptocoins is a nice way to evade taxes. The governments have no way to put taxes on the transactions ... yet.</p>

<p>Conspiracy now: Soon they will discover that it is a perfect way to see all your transactions. They just have to know who is the owner of the wallet and they will be able to see everything you do on the blockchain. They will even force people to reveal their accounts like they do when you enter the USA, they are allowed to ask you for your facebook, gmail or phone password.</p>

<p>Why should they not be able to ask for your cryptocoin accounts?</p>

<p>This is just how i see cryptocoins. I think it is a nice idea but these are some of the problems i see coming.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with almost all the points you made. Cryptos are in a big speculative bubble at the moment. And yes, most of them will be as transparent as the internet is today. (A big mistake exploited by big corporations and governments then). There are private coins (cash equivalent) out there that will be used by the black market and privacy aware people just as cash is used today.</p>

<p>You seem to believe that states (groups of people claiming ownership of some land on this planet before I was born on the same land) have a native right to tax? Why so? I don&#39;t see taxes and states as a natural right. I see spending for common good, health care, safety, infrastructure, education,... a necessity. But I&#39;m not sure if a state (at least in its current form) is needed or the right form to organize those necessities.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not against taxes in general. I pay mine knowingly that it will be used to fund wars to topple foreign governments to provide me with cheap energy. It saddens me.</p>

<p>You seem to believe that countries are a natural thing as well. I don&#39;t think that is the case and I rather want to think of the one world we live on as my home. Keeping certain traditions and heritage. I don&#39;t need a country for that. 
I&#39;m absolutely against one world government as it boils down to unaccountable hierarchical behaviour. Instead I prefer the status quo over that outcome.</p>

<p>But more than that, I believe in transparent and decentralized decision making process. Never before in history was it possible, that you and me can decide on our (and our communities) both futures no matter where we live on the world by applying funds together.</p>

<p>I&#39;m pro balance between state governments - international corporations - and human groups/individuals.</p>

<p>Cryptos can help re-balance between these forces and give power to the individual and smaller communities over big corporations and big governments. And blockchain applications can help organize many vital parts for society in a more decentralized way.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t fear the change that&#39;ll change our governments. I fear making unwise decisions (made by the masses) by choosing which digital currency they prefer/adopt.</p>

<p>But at least there is freedom of choice. I don&#39;t share the opinion, that governments can stop crypto currencies. You might want to look at private coins such as Monero, you might want to look at decentralized exchanges and marketplaces. You might want to look at various use cases that benefit states (less bureaucracy).</p>

<p>Stopping crypto means stopping the internet/the power grid.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for your answer.</p>

<p>You are making quite a lot of assumptions about my believes just from a few comments a made. I am happy to tell you that you are wrong in most of these.</p>

<p>My opinion is based on the status quo. Of course i want this to change but right now it is what it is and i was just talking about what is happening right now. Just a bit about what this could lead to in the near future.</p>

<p>I agree with you in many if not most of your statements.</p>

<p>I also see cryptocoins as a way to go. What we have here is just a test. Better systems will come soon. My wife considers me to be a pessimist. I call myself a realist and i think that only being aware of which bad things could happen will help us to prevent them.</p>

<p>To stop and ban cryptocoins is in my opinion absolutely possible if the people/organizations in power decide so. It is as possible in the same way they ban drugs. Cryptocoins would still exist, but will be banished to the black market heavily criminalized. We know what happened to society after baning drugs.</p>

<p>I am afraid that only certain cryptocoins will be accepted from governments a legal.</p>

<p>Thank for pointing me to monero. I will take a look at it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The gist, as it applies to Bitcoin, is <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Quantum_computing_and_Bitcoin">here</a>. A more general overview is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-quantum_cryptography#Hash-based_cryptography">here</a>. Basically, symmetrical algorithms, such as SHA-256, remain safe - the number of operations to force a collision would drop from 2<sup>256</sup> (classical) to 2<sup>128</sup> (quantum), but 2<sup>128</sup> is still infeasibly large to consider (and simply doubling the key length would restore the same level of security anyway).</p>

<p>Asymmetrical algorithms, which are used in Bitcoin, are <em>far</em> more vulnerable - attacking a Bitcoin private key on a classical machine would take about 2<sup>128</sup> operations (which is stated above is completely impractical) However, using Shor&#39;s algorithm on a quantum machine would cut that to only 128<sup>3</sup> (or about two million). That&#39;s entirely doable, and on any thing beyond the first generation of quantum machines likely to be <em>extremely</em> fast.</p>

<p>It&#39;s still an open area of research, but it&#39;s believed that, e.g., <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamport_signature">Lamport signatures</a> can provide security in a post-quantum environment. There&#39;s greater restrictions on how they can be used, and the maths isn&#39;t as simple/elegant, but by basing themselves on symmetrical primitives (which as discussed above don&#39;t lose significant security in a post-quantum setting), they retain their security on both classical and quantum machines.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s open source technology.  Technically you could even start your own crypto currency.  Getting other people to use it or participate in the network and then proving its secure and continually support its evolution so people continue using it is whole other ball of wax.  Some coins are development projects for computer science nerds, others are fronted by entrepreneurs, it&#39;s kind of the wild west.  The protocols themselves are just foundations, and crypto currency is part of that base foundation, the real mindfuck is imagining what is possible with the layers built on top of that foundation.  Thinking about what bitcoin or ethereum as an ecosystem looks like in 10 years is what interests me.</p>

<p>The thing that has been bothering me lately is what if cryptocurrencies are the thing that actually enables the features of pay to play internet and completely destroys the ability for open and free access by being able to put monetary fees on every transaction?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t have links but I&#39;ve been reading that the quantum-resistant cryptography is more time consuming for normal CPUs in an undesirable way.  My impression is that the public sphere will continue pretending like quantum processing doesn&#39;t exist and this means that these new algorithms are just more computationally expensive.  The spy organizations likely love this and they will want to delay the widespread use of these algorithms for as long as possible.  I predict that it will likely get to a rather ridiculous state at some point when they can just trivially crack communications.</p>

<p>Before Bitcoin, it was not known how to make a digital currency that does not require a central authority to prevent counterfeiting and double-spending. That&#39;s the big breakthrough of cryptocurrency: we no longer require a single point-of-failure that can be corrupted or seized. Prior to this, if you used a digital currency you had to trust both the issuer/maintainer of the currency, and the government, to not manipulate or seize your money. Now you only need to trust mathematics (though manipulation of the price of the currency in exchanges is another issue).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Take the following with a grain of salt (as you should with any story given sans citations). </p>

<p>A family member of mine works for Wells Fargo. In a position which quite often puts him/her around high level execs and their subsequent chatter. This person has held this position for 20 years, and sees these execs quite often. As such, they have become comfortable around said person to the point that they will often joke around and carry on conversation. </p>

<p>Last week I was told of a short conversation this family member had with a high level Wells Fargo exec (who at the time was sharing a stage with execs from Bank Of America, and a couple other “smaller” banks), in which a comment was made that certainly paints Bitcoin, and banking in a not so positive light. </p>

<p>The comment in question was: “Well, eventually we’d like to see all financial transactions done via microchip, especially cryptocurrency”. The comment was made in a <em>“this is going to be a really neat and convenient change in banking technology and we are excited for the possibilities”</em> kind of way as opposed to having an insidious tone. This person told me it felt like this exec was just shooting the shit and speaking on ideas they were working on with excitement. </p>

<p>Now, I trust this person with my life. So I believe them 100%. Which means that comment says two things; #1, big banks have a goal of slowly moving us towards microchipping to complete financial transactions, and #2, this exec said “<strong>we’d</strong> like to ...”, not “Wells Fargo would like to”, but “<strong>we’d</strong> like to”,  implying banking execs are working together in this goal, and then he said “<em>especially</em> cryptocurrency”. </p>

<p>Said family member noted that none of these banking execs ever seem worried in the slightest about cryptocurrency. Almost like they’ve got it all under control. </p>

<p>I really am starting to believe Bitcoin is merely a test or tool for a one world currency. And when you’ve got 7.5 billion people using the same currency, the only logical way to make transactions is with a microchip in your hand. </p>

<p>Anywho, my apologies for lack of citation, but I pretty much have no proof (hence this being a comment and not a post). Thought I’d share this story regardless, as it fits OP’s topic to a T. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yup. That&#39;s why businesses like it.</p>

<p>Ostensibly it&#39;s controlled democratically by miners, but the etheruem devs can set changes as defaults and unless the majority of the miners say &quot;no,&quot; the changes, such as a hard fork protecting sufficiently important assets, will go through.</p>

<p>There is a potential for a properly decentralized ETH-like system. We&#39;ll see how Bitcoin Cash and Ethereum Core do, to see if hard forking away from the main chain is really a viable thing for cryptocurrencies to do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This theory sounds possible, especially the first half. One thing to keep in mind though is that cracking SHA256 or even a 2048 bit hash still wouldn’t let you “hack” the cryptography on most cryptocurrencies. The algorithm intentionally requires many CPU or memory intensive operations to make it hard to brute force, and the code is open source for anyone to look at and find vulnerabilities. The math behind cryptography is sound, and blockchain cryptography is constantly improved.</p>

<p>I’m pretty sure a quantum computer could still brute force most cryptography schemes though, aside from a few which are supposedly designed to be resistant.</p>

<p>The suggestion is that there is a deliberate weakness in SHA-256 that would enable the NSA to find arbitrary data that hashes to a preset value with relative ease (I find it unlikely, given the nature and scrutiny of SHA-256 and the constraints on input data that Bitcoin enforces, but there is precedent that they <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_EC_DRBG">might <em>try</em></a>). That would enable you to form an ostensibly valid block for significantly less work.</p>

<p>Personally, I think the more likely attack would be on the private keys. If you can reverse-engineer the private key from the public key, you can spend any coins you desire and it would just appear as a normal transaction to anyone other than the rightful holder of the coins.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Although Bitcoin adds mining and a shared, peer-to-peer blockchain transaction authentication system to this structure</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s the very thing that made Bitcoin important - without that, it&#39;s nothing that hadn&#39;t been considered before (see b-money and bit gold).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>it&#39;s clear that the NSA was researching cryptocurrencies long before everyday users had ever heard of the term.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course - part of the reason for the NSA existence is to do pure research, and everyday users won&#39;t have heard or be interested in that. I remember when Bitcoin first came around - the fact that it was so successful was certainly a surprise, but the concepts were nothing particularly new or surprising (studying computer science meant I&#39;d come across the concept before)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It also describes &quot;secure hashing&quot; to be &quot;both one-way and collision-free.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is literally the definition of a secure hash function (strictly speaking, it&#39;s that a collision cannot be engineered and is unlikely, rather than being impossible). If they described it as anything else, it would just be wrong.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>it would mean the NSA could steal everybody&#39;s Bitcoins whenever it wants</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bitcoin only has value <em>because</em> the security guarantees hold. If it&#39;s proven that the NSA (or any other third party) can tamper with transactions at will, its value will collapse. If you wish to argue that it&#39;ll be propped up by government intervention (forcing people to use it), they could do that <em>now</em>, without the engineering effort and risk of developing Bitcoin.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In fact, every cryptocurrency becomes obsolete with the invention of large-scale quantum computing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is just not true. SHA-256, the hash function controlling mining, is still effectively quantum-secure - finding a collision even on a quantum machine will take ~2<sup>128</sup> operations, which is an impossibly large number. The public keys that control access to specific coins is far more vulnerable - an attack would be quite feasible - BUT a new address type that uses a quantum-secure algorithm would be relatively easy to introduce. All it would is sending the coins to a new address and then even a quantum computer would not be useful in attacking them.</p>

<p>It&#39;s entirely possible that the NSA or some other government had a hand in the development of Bitcoin (I&#39;d say likely - Satoshi Nakamoto OPSEC has basically been flawless AFAIK despite the huge amount of attention his work has drawn), but I&#39;d say its nature and design would make it far more useful for the acquisition and distribution of black budgets than acquiring total control over monetary systems.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that Bitcoin would be able to react fast enough to known public weaknesses in its encryption/hashes because just because they are comprimisable doesn&#39;t mean it will be free and instant to do that.  So instead of it taking 1000 years or whatever it might take days/weeks/months.  People would flip the fuck out but once they got up to speed on the new signing then the disaster would be averted.  One huge thing that a group like the NSA could do however would be to recover known &quot;lost&quot; Bitcoins and then spend them.  This would create one hell of a black budget.  It would be so much more profitable to go after lost coins then stealing them from people who would squeal all over the blogosphere.  If Bitcoins ever become worth millions of dollars each then grabbing these coins would be enough to fund a breakaway civilization.  It would be almost unlimited money if spent out over many decades.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sooo...then people can fork the code or the blockchain and found their own cryptocurrencies? Crypto is uncentralizable. You can&#39;t crush it. It&#39;s like saying the government invented calculus so they&#39;d have full control over the study of physics. If everyone knows calculus, then everyone can do calculus based physics. </p>

<p>Sure, the government could force merchants to only accept crypto, but alternate markets would emerge for altcoins over tor just like they did for bitcoin. Then, merchants would realize they were missing out and pressure would grow to allow the acceptance of altcoins. I&#39;m sorry, this just doesn&#39;t make sense.</p>

<p>The entire purpose of the blockchain is to make it so the government CAN&#39;T do things like this. A government backed central ledger, with government controlled nodes? Sure. But a blockchain? Nah. And if Bitcoin and Eth get criminalized, so what? You think that&#39;ll stop them? They were already quasi-legal. They were first used for buying illegal drugs over anonymous TOR markets.</p>

<p>Let them try this shit. It only works out better for libertarians.</p>

<p>Also if you create one for all currency do you know what happens, well inflation like there is no tomorrow. The reason that usd is not loosing its value as much it’s because business is conducted using it. Once you give it to 1b+ or so people dollar is worth shit. That’s why euro is worth less than dollar because it’s the main currency for the people and is hardly used for commodities or not as much as usd. </p>

<p>Now currencies like Ripple, or even Bitcoin Cash, could definitely be hostile attempts to control cryptos, but &quot;they&quot; would never want to give the powers that bitcoin affords over to the people like that. Much like the internet, it&#39;s now a shared public good that they have to work against to stop without showing too much of their hand.</p>

<p>Looks to me like they are trying to scare the OG bitcoin community (libertarians and anti-establishment conspiracy theorists) into thinking that bitcoin is an NSA psyop and to not trust it. That to me seems far more likely than this entire experiment being a long con by TPTB.</p>

<p>it&#39;s now becoming increasingly evident that Bitcoin may be a creation of the NSA and was rolled out as a &quot;normalization&quot; experiment to get the public familiar with digital currency.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Demonstrably false. The history of cryptocurrency clearly was born of a desire to remove a third-party verification system as we currently know it. Now, it&#39;s true that all the big banks have caught on to the idea of cryptocurrencies and their importance in the next phase of financial control, however, they are johnny-come-latelys. People at the NSA may have talked about what cryptocurrencies are and how they might disrupt the currency milieu as it stands today, but to say the NSA is the &quot;invisible hand&quot; behind bitcoin is just wrong.</p>

<p>If there is a conspiracy here, it&#39;s a question of what the Federal Reserve has in mind for dealing with a currency structure that&#39;s not debt-based and doesn&#39;t need bank verification to allow transactions. Will they create their own blockchain networks? And how will these networks integrate the current debt ledgers into it? In other words, how will the Federal Reserve continue to make money if they&#39;re cut out of the transaction cycle? </p>

<p>These are important questions, but the history of cryptocurrencies runs counter to the narrative that they are the creation of TPTB. They aren&#39;t. They are exactly the opposite. </p>

<p>Cryptography is not bulletproof, but the way bitcoin is designed, whoever takes over or hacks a block has to take over and provide proof of work for the rest of the chain or the other nodes on the chain will detect the error and eliminate fraudulent transaction.</p>

<p>Yes, the NSA wrote the encryption algorithm and had speculated about digital cash, but none of this proves bitcoin was designed by them as an attempt for one world currency. Bitcoin would actually be terrible for governments to use because it would shine a lot on the inflow and outflow of everything they spent.  They couldnt hide money in black budgets.  They couldnt print pallets of money to hand to warlords to buy their allegiances.  Its a terrible money system if you want to keep things secret.  The entire world can review every publicly encoded transaction.</p>
