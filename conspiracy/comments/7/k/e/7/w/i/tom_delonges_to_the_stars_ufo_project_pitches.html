    <div class="md"><p>This is the new Podesta narrative...this narrative will start slowly building steam and MSM will start announcing small reports about unidentifiable objects around the world appearing or being found after being hidden away for so long.  All, just to distract and change the narrative from the massive crimes the deep state has been perpetrating against the citizens of the world...not just America!</p>

<p>Why?  To explain the soon-to-be-exposed existence of major technologies and medical cures that have been hidden from us by the elite cabal for almost a century!  </p>

<p>Just watch the news.  More and more about aliens being found or hidden away will be reported.  </p>

<p>Why aliens?  Because the elite think this will explain all the &quot;new&quot; technologies that will become public soon.  They want us to believe the aliens brought us this technology.  Because the public will want to lynch all elites once we find out they had cures to diseases our families died from too young, that they could generate power without petroleum products etc... so they want us to believe that aliens has brought the “new” technology.  </p>

<p>Wait for it...the shock will not come soon, but a slow drip so it does not cause mobs out for lynching.  But don&#39;t be distracted. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t initially deny, but then I looked into the facts. What motivation does John Podesta have, and is it likely that it&#39;s in anyone&#39;s best interest other than his own, given his history? Delonge is right at the point of his career where he&#39;s running out of money. Then he pops up and begs for donations to some humanitarian cause. These things can&#39;t be overlooked.</p>
