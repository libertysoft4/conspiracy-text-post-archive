        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Jesuits and underwordly occult members use defilement, desecration, slander, and blasphemy or disrespect for attacks. They are highly deceptive and manipulative false accusers. They are spiteful and hateful towards the rest of humanity. Johnny Depp and Barack Obama are is underworldly. Jesuit priests use these demonic techniques to control their Jesuit agents.</p>

<p>Witches use seduction and sex. They trespass on people if they have sexual energies because they feed off it. Witches are murderous sexual sadists that try to appear innocent. They create energetic knots, binds, and chains in the physiology. They curse, hex, and slander people too in order to break down a persons spirit. They are also poisoners. Witches are ruthless and can be wrathful at times. Warlocks are male witches and war like. When witches are angered male warlocks command them. Julia Louis-Dreyfus and Angelina Jolie are high level witches. Marylyn Manson is a murderous warlock.</p>

<p>Freemasons and Kabbalists are builders. They construct psychic temples for idols like the fallen angels. They create mind control programs made of deceptions. Luciferian Freemasons are insane liars and brainwash people with these lies. They invade into the minds of others and drill lies like a grind stone. They create mental walls, barriers, and blockages to keep society in ignorance. Freemasons are greedy. Freemasons use religious brainwashing as well. The wicked use the Bible as their sword and shield. Mitt Romney is a high level Freemason. Daniel Gilbert and Jared Kushner are high level Kabbalists.</p>

<p>Nazi Illuminati are militant and work with Amazon women which are also sexual sadists. Nazis use oppressive sex magic on people and are like pimps using sex gangster Amazons. They are also false teachers that make up insane and irrational teachings to attempt to incorporate their wickedness with nature. Nazis are envious and Amazons are simple minded, aggressive, and lustful. Nazis often use religion as their defense. Demanding that you love and forgive them is a frequently used spell by them. Prince Harry is a top Nazi. Arnold Schwarzenegger is a Nazi general. Viking cults are just like Nazis. Prince Carl Philip is a top Viking cult leader.</p>

<p>Gangster Illuminati members are like Nazis. They are fascist and militant. They work with Amazon sex gangsters and have superiority complexes like Nazis based on ego, pride, and envy. They are thieves that steal from adrenal glands for strength. They steal energy from faces, eyes, and muscles too. They are very parasitic and oppressive. 50 Cent, Dr Dre, and Jay Z are high level Illuminati mobsters and ravenous thieves. Beyoncé is a murderous Amazon.</p>

<p>Alchemists are trained in chemicals and the human physiology. They trespass on bodies and hack into their physiology. Chemicals effect feelings. They work with foods and drugs. They engineered vaccines which are designed to target the nervous system which weakens a persons spiritual armor or electromagnetic field. Alchemists are extremely arrogant. Will Smith is an alchemist. He admits this in a video.</p>

<p>Conjurers are demonologists. Demons are really animal spirits and sometimes animal hybrid spirits created by sorcerers. They use the nature of animals like snakes, insects, and aggressive beasts and impose their traits onto people. Conjurers often invoke demons themselves. Conjurers are very high level. Aleister Crowley was a conjurer. Jay Electronica is a high level conjurer today. Eminem is a conjurer and mason.</p>

<p>Zionist Rabbis and Luciferian Pastors are false judges and condemners. They meddle in every ones business and try to claim anyone who opposes corruption is corrupt. They are paid liars, brainwashers, and false accusers. David Baruch Lau the Chief Ashkenazi Rabbi of Israel is a high level false judge. Justice John Roberts is another paid off Canon law false accuser and condemner. The pastor Joseph Prince is one of the most sadistic parasites on Earth. I was surprised at first when I realized it. He is like a rabid maggot and sadistic lying false accuser. Priests specialize in brainwashing or Luciferian baptism which causes psychosis. </p>

<p>Bishops are very high level and operate as psychic watchers. They oversee everything. They are trained in Christian masonry and brainwashing as well as conjuring. They also manage satanic ritual abuse which is why they are involved with pedophilia so often. They use demons to oppress and control others. They are condemners but mostly stay quiet. They are the top of the Illuminati pyramids. Bishops rule over episcopal sees. They are overseers. Cardinal Timothy Dolan is a very high level Bishop and an oppressive blood drunken lunatic.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why, even in 2017, in our age of integration and tolerance, if your black, and want to join the Freemasons they will direct you to a prince hall lodge where you do the rituals but never really get the secrets or occult power.

    <div class="md"><p><a href="/u/AhuwahZeus">/u/AhuwahZeus</a> and I have had this exchange before, and they won&#39;t be shocked to hear what I&#39;m about to write, so mostly this is for the benefit of others...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Jesuits and underwordly occult members use defilement, desecration, slander, and blasphemy or disrespect for attacks.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Okay, this is a pretty broad claim, and it seems that if it were true, it would be trivial to find evidence... Without resorting to a breathless conspiracy website, what historical evidence is there that this is true?</p>

<p>I really don&#39;t know much about the Jesuits, but it seems to me that they have had a footprint on history that&#39;s about the same as any long-lived, relatively large organization: some good, some bad and a lot of not very interesting.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Luciferian Freemasons are insane liars and brainwash people with these lies.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ve been a Freemason for quite a while now, and have yet to meet any of these &quot;Luciferian Freemasons&quot;. Why is it that non-Freemasons are so convinced that there are secret &quot;Luciferian Freemasons&quot; creeping around our organization, yet the men who have been members of this fraternity for hundreds of years fail to find evidence to support such a hypothesis?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Mitt Romney is a high level Freemason ... 50 Cent, Dr Dre, and Jay Z are high level Illuminati mobsters and ravenous thieves. Beyoncé is a murderous Amazon ... Eminem is a conjurer and mason</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This reads more like celebrity fanfic than anything a rational person should be taking seriously. All you&#39;re doing is riffing on names of celebrities and organizations you think are nefarious.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I find it interesting that you go from making a fairly banal claim, &quot;Alchemists are trained in chemicals.&quot; Sure... though &quot;trained&quot; is a matter of some art, here. Most modern alchemists have no formal training. It&#39;s not as if there&#39;s a college major in alchemy. But okay, that&#39;s a fine claim, then you bring in some odd claim that doesn&#39;t even really scan, &quot;They trespass on bodies and hack into their physiology.&quot; What do you mean by this? What is &quot;hacking into physiology?!&quot; More importantly, what evidence do you have that such a thing is possible and that specifically people claiming to be alchemists are the ones doing it?</p>

<p>A wall of text that claims that, &quot;<em>A</em> is related to <em>B</em> and <em>C</em> is related to <em>B</em> so All <em>A</em> are <em>C</em>!&quot; isn&#39;t evidence of anything more than the author&#39;s poor grasp of logic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Admitted he is a Freemason. He is one of them and running a defense for them. You are just using vague denial which is a common tactic used by Lucifeirans, Freemasons, and sorcerers. The Church of Mormon was created by Freemasons. This is a fact. Freemasonry has Babylonian origins. This is also established. The LDS Conference Center is designed just like the Hanging Gardens of Babylon. This is easily confirmed. Almost all major politicians are identified as Freemasons including Bush, Obama, Truman, FDR, etc. I wont respond to any more of what you wrote because it would be like banging my head against the wall especially since you are what I am exposing and have no interest in debating facts.</p>

<p>My denial is not vague. It&#39;s very specific: you never provide any evidence of you strange leaps and hyperbolic claims.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Almost all major politicians are identified as Freemasons including Bush, Obama, Truman, FDR, etc.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Identified by whom? Truman and FDR were self-proclaimed Freemasons. Truman was even the Grand Master of Missouri, but your claim then (as is your general style) leaps over to unrelated people and ideas. I could tell you that there were 14 US Presidents who were Freemasons, plus two who had a tie to the Fraternity, but never joined (Johnson and Clinton), but I doubt that you&#39;d accept that.</p>

<p>You claimed that most US Presidents were Masons. This claim is not bolstered by having seen GHWB in a fez once.</p>

<p>That&#39;s because there is none other than Joseph Smith having been a Mason and borrowed details from the three degrees for his endowment ceremony. Claiming that because someone is a Mormon, they are obviously Masons, is just silly.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t speak to your claims of individuals being Jesuits (typically, I find that that claim is made on as flimsy a basis as the claims that every famous person in history was a Freemason) but the fact that many future leaders got their start in Catholic schools is hardly shocking. They are excellent schools and are not driven by the whims of public education, which I&#39;m a tremendous proponent of, but cannot help but admit its limitations.</p>

<p>Well that&#39;s okay, because I can speak to it. While freemasonry has been blown out of proportion as an illuminati boogeyman, (i&#39;m actually debating as to whether I should ask a friend in the masons for entry into it) if anything, attention to the Jesuit order and their actions has been under reported. Kennedy, I&#39;m convinced, was killed either by the order, or because of his dealings with them. </p>

<p>Like Steve Bannon, Bill Clinton graduated from Georgetown, one of the nation&#39;s oldest Jesuit colleges. Podesta has taught there since the 90s. </p>

<p>&quot;On one of his first days on the job, Mr. Obama heard Cardinal Bernardin speak at an economic development meeting. He felt like a Catholic novice there, he wrote in his memoir, and later decided “not to ask what a catechism was.” But he was a quick study.</p>

<p>“&#39;He had to do a power analysis of each Catholic church&#39;,” said one of his mentors at the time, Gregory Galluzzo, a former Jesuit priest and disciple of the organizer Saul Alinsky. Mr. Obama, Mr. Galluzzo said, soon understood the chain of command and who had influence in individual parishes.&quot;</p>

<p>Maybe the claims against Masons exist because the Jesuits promote them, viewing Freemasonry as being just as heretical as Protestantism. That&#39;s what Catholic orders are created for: to combat and purge the world of what they believe to be heresy. </p>

<p>but the fact that many future leaders got their start in Catholic schools is hardly shocking. They are excellent schools and are not driven by the whims of public education, which I&#39;m a tremendous proponent of, but cannot help but admit its limitations.</p>

<p>As opposed to the lack of accountability in private schools? I think between Catholic school and home school, I&#39;d have to opt for homeschooling if I were a parent. The track record of abuse is just too massive. </p>

<p>I can&#39;t speak to your claims of individuals being Jesuits (typically, I find that that claim is made on as flimsy a basis as the claims that every famous person in history was a Freemason)</p>

<p>Well that&#39;s okay, because I can speak to it. While freemasonry has been blown out of proportion as an illuminati boogeyman, (i&#39;m actually debating as to whether I should ask a friend in the masons for entry into it) if anything, attention to the Jesuit order and their actions has been under reported. Kennedy, I&#39;m convinced, was killed either by the order, or because of his dealings with them. </p>

<p>Interestingly, from that article:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>For Trump, his two years at Fordham University, a Jesuit school in the Bronx, seem to leave little impact on his life. After his sophomore year, Trump transferred to the Ivy league University of Pennsylvania</p>

<p>This is part of what I was saying. Yes, Catholic schools are excellent institutions, but to assume that everyone who attended one is allied with their order is unrealistic.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>There certainly are Jesuits who have no love for Freemasonry. But I don&#39;t get the impression that Freemasonry is very high on their priorities.</p>

<p>Sounds like mug partisanship to me. </p>

<p>But let&#39;s not conflate Jesuit with Catholic. Nobody has claimed that all Catholic institutions are Jesuit. Nor that every Jesuit is privy to the order&#39;s inner workings nor the machinations of its leadership. Jesuits are many things, but &quot;overtly democratic&quot; is not one of them. </p>

<p>Also, just analyze the ridiculousness of this statement. How the hell is leaving an okay school like Fordham for an elite school like Penn, evidence that his times there had little impact on him? Is there evidence that Trump&#39;s experiences there had little impact on his life? Is it even possible? </p>

<p>Or is claiming it just an attempt for the author to smugly jab at Trump?</p>

<p>That&#39;s what the Geology community said about meteorology before the Jesuits rebranded it &quot;climatology&quot;.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think that was the claim. The claim was that he spent two years there and evidences little in the way of a shift in worldview as a result. He seems much more a product of his father&#39;s business dealings than his schooling.</p>

<p>Because it confirmed the relevant bit of information: that Trump attended a Jesuit university. That doesn&#39;t mean it should be trusted on every claim. That Trump went to Fordham is a factual claim. That it left little impact is an opinion, and one backed up by nothing. In this day and age only a complete imbecile doesn&#39;t first work to unravel and quarantine the political spin, agenda, and opinions (fake news) in a news article from the verifiable factual data. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Admitted he is a Freemason. He is one of them and running a defense for them. You are just using vague denial which is a common tactic used by Lucifeirans, Freemasons, and sorcerers. The Church of Mormon was created by Freemasons. This is a fact. Freemasonry has Babylonian origins. This is also established. The LDS Conference Center is designed just like the Hanging Gardens of Babylon. This is easily confirmed. Almost all major politicians are identified as Freemasons including Bush, Obama, Truman, FDR, etc. I wont respond to any more of what you wrote because it would be like banging my head against the wall especially since you are what I am exposing and have no interest in debating facts.</p>
