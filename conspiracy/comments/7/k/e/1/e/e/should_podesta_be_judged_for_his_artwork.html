<p>Without getting into the conspiracies that hold the most weight any conspiracy has ever held, even with putting that aside, when we look into his artwork and lifestyle with quickly come to realize he is perverted in the sickest ways imaginable. Therefore they are creeps. Kind of seems like an easy concept to me but then again maybe not everyone has a healthy clean mind so I cannot relate to those.</p>

<p>It&#39;s all over the web. My conscious can&#39;t handle looking at any more of his perversions but I will try to make a post soon with all his artwork habits with examples where you can all probably out yourselves that&#39;s people who support this.</p>

I don&#39;t watch YouTube videos because they are terribly sourced but I live in the real world and interact with many people every day and I can tell you that pedophelia is not becoming normalized in any way. If you know anyone who thinks it is becoming normal it is most likely because you are associating with people who see young girls or boys in a sexual way. You seeing paintings of fully clothed children as pedophelic is evidence that you may need help yourself. </p>

<p>Which parts of the article do you disagree with? This is beyond just one photo it&#39;s when you put the whole picture together. I mean if there was no other connections at all and podesta happens to have maybe this one painting then it wouldn&#39;t have been such a cause for alarm you know  But because of all the other connections then it starts to raise question about his preferences.</p>

<p>*They&#39;re both creeps. Don&#39;t deny it lol.</p>

<p>What have either of them done exactly? </p>

<p>Without getting into the conspiracies that hold the most weight any conspiracy has ever held, even with putting that aside, when we look into his artwork and lifestyle we quickly come to realize he is perverted in the sickest ways imaginable. Therefore they are creeps. Kind of seems like an easy concept to me but then again maybe not everyone has a healthy clean mind so I cannot relate to those.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>*Like we haven&#39;t seen Podesta being creepy. </p>

<p>I haven&#39;t, can you illustrate? </p>

<p>Podestas instagram? That is a new one. Please remind me. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s all over the web. My conscious can&#39;t handle looking at any more of his perversions but I will try to make a post soon with all his artwork habits with examples where you can all probably out yourselves that&#39;s people who support this.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>*Or that stuff is normal to you? Cuz lots of weirdos around here think there&#39;s nothing wrong. You give me that vibe.</p>

<p>Ad hominem.</p>

<p>You&#39;re literally from TMOR the land of the troll factory.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Russia has a massive problem with pedophelia and their porn industry is disturbing. I don&#39;t watch YouTube videos because they are terribly sourced but I live in the real world and interact with many people every day and I can tell you that pedophelia is not becoming normalized in any way. If you know anyone who thinks it is becoming normal it is most likely because you are associating with people who see young girls or boys in a sexual way. You seeing paintings of fully clothed children as pedophelic is evidence that you may need help yourself. </p>
