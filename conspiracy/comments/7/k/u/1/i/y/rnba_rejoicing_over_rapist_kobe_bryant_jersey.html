He grabbed her by the neck, and she feared for her life. He bent her over a chair and removed her panties. She said twice that she begged him to stop but he penetrated her anyway. She left about five minutes later. Her clothes were messed up. She was upset. There was blood on her panties and on his shirt. That blood matched her DNA.</a></p>

Kobe was one of my all time favorite players and so many, yeah me too, gave him a pass. Hell I can remember defending Kobe and thinking, yeah she probably just wanted to extort him.

<p>PR bots sniffed this one out and hit it <em>hard</em>, I should have monitored this one right from the start, had no idea this one would strike a nerve  and the AI (probably Google&#39;s) would send the clean-up crew, and of all things, Kobe in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, really?</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobe_Bryant_sexual_assault_case">Read all about it</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Eagle County Sheriff investigators first confronted Bryant with the sexual assault accusation on July 2.[1] During the July 2003 interview with investigators, Bryant initially told investigators that he did not have sexual intercourse with his accuser, a 19-year-old woman who worked at the hotel where Bryant was staying. When the officers told Bryant that she had taken an exam that yielded physical evidence, such as semen, Bryant admitted to having sexual intercourse with her, but stated that the sex was consensual.[2] When asked about bruises on the accuser&#39;s neck, Bryant admitted to &quot;strangling&quot; her during the encounter, stating that held her &quot;from the back&quot; &quot;around her neck&quot;, that strangling during sex was his &quot;thing&quot; and that he had a pattern of strangling a different sex partner (not his wife) during their recurring sexual encounters. When asked how hard he was holding onto her neck, Bryant stated, &quot;My hands are strong. I don&#39;t know.&quot; Bryant stated that he assumed consent for sex because of the accuser&#39;s body language such as her kissing him, putting her hand on his penis and bending over, but that he did not explicitly ask for her consent during the encounter. Bryant later contradicted that statement saying he believed his accuser was capable of saying no because during the encounter he asked her if he could &quot;cum on her face&quot;, and she said no.</p>
