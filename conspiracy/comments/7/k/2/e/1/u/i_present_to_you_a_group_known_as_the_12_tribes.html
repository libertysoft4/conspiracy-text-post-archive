        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I personally encountered these people when visiting relatives down in Tennessee a few years ago. They run these little deli&#39;s close to University Campuses and the stores are filled with very young individuals.</p>

<p>Our waiter was from California and said that they&#39;ve been shipped all around the country through the organization. He also said that a lot of homeless kids from other locations were taken in and shipped elsewhere.</p>

<p>The walls in the deli are filled with religious murals depicting some type of story line. Some of these images are kinda dark. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>On September 5, 2013, German police raided two communities belonging to the Twelve Tribes and removed 40 children to protect them from alleged continued abuse</p>

<p>Either way, I think people need to be aware of this group. They&#39;re very cult like. They have an international network. Their behavior appears to involve targeting young children and teenagers. They are more active in areas with homeless teens.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Over here in the US, we have issues with groups that sell magazines.  A lot of runaways think it is easy money and see other kids &quot;travelling the countryside&quot;.  Instead they are kept in cheap hotels and forced to knock doors all day.  They are physically, verbally, psychologically, and sexually abused.  They get into drugs and sleep with God only knows who. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was approached by this group when I had just turned 18 years old. I thought it was pretty strange that an older middle-aged man was traveling around with four young guys in their late teens selling magazines door-to-door. They really do travel around the country and they even told me that we would be staying in motels. I&#39;m glad I said no because 18 year old me almost said yes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My friends little brother was part of this. He told me about it, even told me to look up the 60 Minutes episode where they were talking about it. He said they took him from California to Chicago as well as other places. The funny thing is that he didn&#39;t see it as abuse, but as them &#39;giving him a great opportunity&#39;. Now he is a youth pastor or some shit, so I guess he is just easily convinced by cult like organizations.</p>

<p>We used to have another cult, fronted by a vegetarian restaurant, a Sri Chinmoy cult. Had a friend get caught up in that one.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This was one of the groups I was warned about by other friends before I started getting into the jamband scene. They bring their busses to Phish shows and some of them walking around trying to get you to check their movement out.  They look to pick up spun/trippin people. They are often real inviting but STAY OFF THE BUS. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They have a shop here in my town and a ship they give tours on. The coffee shop is very popular and the ship is pretty cool. They are a religious group and are very similar to a cult. I have spoken to them, a little odd, but I didn&#39;t sense any danger.  Next time I&#39;m out I&#39;ll see if I can find some of their pamphlets. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>haha they have a restaurant (and nearby farm) near me.</p>

<p>I just went there for the first time a few days ago. the sign out front said they were open 24/5. so i looked it up and they are open 24 hours but closed for weekends?</p>

<p>i thought it was some business that was closed, its in a rough area of town.</p>

<p>But i asked around and sure enough, its run by the cult i&#39;ve heard about for years that goes to music festivals. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve been drunk at 3am and wanted food, but the 24 hour mcdonalds requires drivethrough and i wont drive drunk.</p>

<p>so it makes sense. they capture desperate souls drinking on weeknights, offer them group acceptance, women etc...</p>

<p>Sandwich and chilli were on point, i will go again, i&#39;ve seen threads where people refuse to eat there based on their racist and child beating ways.... But I like donairs and lots of them fund hezbollah etc.. I dont really give a shit as long as the food is good</p>
