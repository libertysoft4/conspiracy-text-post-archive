        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">101</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2017-12-16 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/AreEternal.html">AreEternal</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Porn has become TPTB most accessible device for psychological manipulation.  There have been other posts detailing its negative effect on the brain.  I was doing some research into porn&#39;s relation to erectile dysfunction and I have come to the conclusion that it is being used as a population control weapon. </p>

<p>I found <a href="https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/879982">this</a> article on medscape which draws some frightening correlations  between porn and erectile dysfunction.  </p>

<p>From the article;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A 2014 US armed forces health surveillance survey found that rates of erectile dysfunction had more than doubled during the preceding decade, from about 6 per 1000 person-years to about 13 per 1000 person-years, he reported. This increase was primarily accounted for by an increase in the incidence of psychogenic, rather than organic, erectile dysfunction, and coincided with the growth of pornography on the internet.</p>

<p>To see whether there is a correlation between addiction to pornography and sexual dysfunction, Dr Christman and coauthor Jonathan Berger, MD, also from the Naval Medical Center San Diego, used an anonymous survey that included questions about sexual function, preferences, and pornography use, as well as the usual demographic and medical history questions.</p>

<p>The survey was offered to 20- to 40-year-old patients who presented to their urology clinic.</p>

<p>A total of 439 men received questionnaires, and 314 (71.5%) responded. In all, 71 women were given the surveys, and 48 (68%) responded. The majority of both male and female responders were active-duty military (96.8% and 58%, respectively).</p>

<p>Men were evaluated for sexual function with the International Index of Erectile Function 15-item questionnaire, and women with the validated Female Sexual Function Index. Addiction to pornography was measured by two validated instruments: the Pornography Craving Questionnaire and the Obsessive Passion Scale.</p>

<p>In all, <strong>27% of male respondents had sexual dysfunction</strong>, as defined by an International Index of Erectile Function score of 25 or less, and <strong>52% of females had sexual dysfunction</strong>, as defined by a Female Sexual Function Index score of 26.55 or less.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The numbers don&#39;t lie.  What&#39;s interesting is that porn&#39;s ability to cause sexual dysfunction is even greater among females.  Porn is not healthy and natural.  It can destroy a person&#39;s ability to have sex and intimacy with someone they love.  The fact that it is so accessible to everyone at a young age is cause for concern.  </p>

<p>Agreed.  I am planning on doing more research into this. Thank you for your help. I find the PIED numbers helpful because they are concrete evidence of porns negative effects.  It&#39;s much harder to prove a nefarious agenda such as controlling the population even though I know this to be true. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed.</p>

<p>What&#39;s worse is that it directly accesses the dopamine factory in the brain. That&#39;s about as close as you can get to the levers of control over human behavior. In a word, addiction.</p>

<p>The problem is that most ordinary users cannot simply unhook themselves from this stuff. It&#39;s a hard-wired response. </p>

<p>The solution is uninviting - draconian prohibition.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That battle is already on. The wars in the middle east have an implicit factor nobody on either side will state out loud: porn.

<p>The big-C &quot;Church&quot; is hardly in the game at all, since making any sort of common cause with the militant middle eastern critique of Voltaire is out of the question. </p>

<p>Sure, I already mention hard-wired, addiction-level &quot;want&quot; involved in porn and the public. It&#39;s an age-old, humanity-level issue.</p>

<p>But it&#39;s a political issue too. So far, the muslim masses appear to be willing to follow their religious leadership on the porn prohibition issue, as did Americans until the 1960&#39;s, and in both eras, porn constitutes a significant part of the reactionary vs. liberal political struggle.</p>

<p>while it is true that all (with the exceptions of Our Lord and the Blessed Mother) have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God, my comment was made in jest. criticisms of e. michael jones as an antisemite fail to adequately comprehend (let alone rebut) his arguments, and i regard the term &quot;radtrad&quot; as a loathsome neologism which is ironic in its hatefulness as it is notable for its lack of literary grace.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it kind of depends on how automation deals with an economy driven by consumer consumption.  If you eliminate consumers by eliminating jobs for consumers, who buys your products?</p>

<p>It may be that stuff gets really cheap and governments extend basic incomes to head off political crisis, offsetting producer automation efficiency, demand and job losses.  In that case I definitely see a highly local and ad-hoc local economic activity springing up, where people re-invent their own local economy to offset wage losses.  A spouse that stays home and does a lot of what traditional &quot;at home wives&quot; do starts to make economic sense again.  The marginal utility of domestic work goes back up above the marginal value of low-wage jobs. </p>

<p>As far as i remember from my childhood, here in the GDR (communist east Germany) we had no problem with too low fertility rates mostly because of free daycare and free schools, free universities. Until the end of the 80&#39;s the fertility rate in east Germany was mostly always 0,4-0,5 above the rate of west Germany.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not to keep wages low.  It&#39;s to keep your own business, that you own, in your own hands without someone else having veto power on what you&#39;re going to or slowing down reaction time, or making simple decisions complex.</p>

It wasn&#39;t really a kind or instrument to keep wages low. Well Wages maybe would have risen to a certain degree when there isn&#39;t enough people for labour. But i think not that much. Also at this time the difference in wealth was way more smaller than it is now.
Societies will face the next problem with more automatisation of industry.
I for myself think that an idea of an unconditional basic income is a topic worth discussing. Also some managers in industry and academics see this an unavoidable step to keep the capitalist system in order/balance (well it was never balanced but not as much in unbalance as now).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wait no. Those coming over the Gotthard to work in Switzerland came into a country where in many regions shit still meant wealth, i.e. a mostly agricultural country. But living in Italy meant to do nothing, because the war killed the infrastructure of their South more than their North. The disparity was &quot;more than 100%&quot;, because labor was then brought on top of the disparity elsewhere. Today migrating even from very afar means to earn in some ratio like six or seven times more as a simple, but learned worker. Back then the lot was to have nothing to do or earn 400 CHF per month. Not 200€ or 2000€ like today.<br/>
It exactly <em>was</em> an instrument to keep wages slow, I can&#39;t recall the minutes of our parliament but my grand-father and other old folk remembered the cited discussion on national television, because the fear was after the war inflation could run away again (back then and because of the gold standard and in a capital inflow situation, labor was important in this regard, it changed in the 70ies abruptly when oil went up and Bretton Woods went down).<br/>
In absolute numbers the Gastarbeiter weren&#39;t even that many, just certain parts and restricted to certain branches, but the effect was that giant, capital intensive stuff could be built like the late national highway system. This is what I meant. The US shoveled Blacks into service jobs to taper that kind of labor shortage. The last wave of stitches over those kind of problems were the Hispanics, which broke the Camels back and brought on Trump.</p>

<p>&quot;No, we don’t believe that any woman should have this choice. No woman should be authorised to stay at home to bring up her children. Society should be totally different. Women should not have that choice, precisely because if there is such a choice, too many women will make that one. It is a way of forcing women in a certain direction.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The &quot;jewish control&quot; was already mentioned. Curiously the very orthodox jews always had a high fertility rate and there the woman are the ones that work, while the men study their religious texts. The less or non-religious jewish population shows similar pattern in sinking fertility rate as other western countries.</p>

<p>It&#39;s strange that nobody mentions pregnancy prevention, social status and lack of institutionial help to raise children, free daycare, free schools, free university.
In a Society were becoming a child includes a risk and burden you can&#39;T except that the fertility rate is stable.
But still in most western countries the lower social classes almost have a higher fertility rate than the middle class. (perhaps i could imagine that more porn would be consumed in lower or non income households as in others)</p>

<p>The most important factors plays the role of the anti-baby pills and how they are affordable for households, combined with the financial/social risks of a parenthood.
An example how both could be combined without having significant Drops in fertility rate is how the communist countries like the GDR handled the situation. First of all the women were emancipated from the beginning there, then the anti-baby pill was free but at the same time provided free daycare for children. As a result the fertility rate was always 0,4-0,5 higher as in western Germany, especially interesting when you take in count that in the 50&#39;s and early 60&#39;s it was very common in west Germany for the women to stay at home and don&#39;t go to work, while in east Germany they were involved in the working market from the beginning.</p>

<p>that does not answer my question.</p>

<p>once again: <em>how many</em>? your reply can be given in either raw numbers or percentages (preferably broken down into lesbians -- now inexplicably included in the umbrella term &quot;gay&quot; -- and homosexual men), and i will accept estimates despite my preference for empirically determined figures.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Being gay is probably something random</p>
</blockquote>

<p>while the cause (or, more likely, causes) of homosexual behavior and identification have yet to be definitively established, i quite doubt that &quot;something random&quot; is the answer.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>throughout history</p>
</blockquote>

<p>since the concept of &quot;homosexuality&quot; is less than two centuries old, i respectfully disagree. lest you think that my stance is one born of &quot;homophobia&quot; (whatever that is), i will point out that lgbt advocates/propagandists have made the same point.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[citation needed]</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Maybe they find out that the drive to have kids can be independent of being gay</p>
</blockquote>

<p>sure, and there are all sorts of reasons to want to have kid (<a href="http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/disturbing-child-abuse-case-links-australians-to/4795348">some</a> less savory than others). simply having children does not constitute creating a nuclear family. in addition to having children, high investment parenting and monogamy are both implied. how common is a desire for monogamy among self-identified male homosexuals? it&#39;s <a href="https://radicalbi.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/endmarriage.jpg">certainly</a> not universal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree somewhat with your interjections. Random can still include something not predetermined but fixed and what I meant with having children is founding a nuclear family for social safety reasons and acceptance within a community, but also because it somewhat feels right to them. Today the (urban) agenda is to almost nail them onto a different lifestyle/life path. My impression is that nobody knows what really is happening but some have a strong and very well delivered agenda to impress a specific group into how they should live their lives.<br/>

<p>is larry flynt jewish? were bob guccione or hugh hefner jewish? jewish overrepresentation in the pornography industry is a topic worthy of discussion, but the language you are using here paints with too broad of a brush. incidentally, it also leaves you open to the charge that you believe that all or most ethnic jews (irrespective of their religious affiliation or lack thereof) support the pornography industry.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s actually a good point to bring up, as historically, and I mean for thousands of years, Jews have been financiers and bankers. And this isn&#39;t like a race or deroagatory thing, they just have always dealt with the money of societies, oftentimes because the rulers and other officials didn&#39;t want to. This was also a way for them to establish themselves within societies that would otherwise want them out of their country. So, they became good at finances and economics, and perhaps, today, this is more easily known because of the internet and knowledge being so easily available about litereally everything that goes on int he world, but in all actuality it has always been the case that jewish people run the money game, that&#39;s what they&#39;re often times good at --among other things.</p>

<p>Regardless, with these industries, the porn industry, film industry, etc., they are widespread primarily because money allows them to be. If mr. jew person wasn&#39;t behind the scenes making all the financial decisions with regards to promotion and distribution, etc., then the porn industries and film industries would probably still exist but just on a more local and small scale. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not necessarily, a problem of &quot;the jews run the industry,&quot; its a problem of people buying into. People have the choice to not watch porn or watch the movies at the theatre or on tv., that is entirely a persons choice, it just doesn&#39;t always seem that way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In an unironically anti-no-true-scotsman way I want to make a different case. The hidden plague AIDS introduced an opportunity to reign this freedom in. A true sexually liberated society (which sadly sounds like &quot;true communism&quot;, but bear a little further), means there is no control via sex. By definition. One woman could manipulate two men into hating each other but teh state and teh church can&#39;t. Family and promised bonds could be separated from sexual confusion. Everything has to be completely transparent. Any double standards vanish. There are no sluts. There is no adultery. A women can&#39;t abandon the family &quot;because he had an affair&quot; etc.<br/>
Unconventional disease and new burdens introduce another layer of conveniently &quot;natural&quot; control. It is natural, but the hideous delay between medicinal detection and societal acceptance seems to me a liiiitle bit to long back there.  </p>

<p>Who wants to overthrow the gov. when you can have sex instead? Well, those who want it to have their way but the gov. still adheres to old power structures which are incompatible with said sexual structures. Timely there are &quot;friendly&quot; court cases flattening the legal landscape into a pan cake, but this is another can of worms.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Insults aside if the woman in the relationship is better poilitically versed than her husband or even her gay partner whatever the household situation is, she should should be able through discussion be able to convince the rest of the household on why they as a family unit should vote for candidate X. A household should make decisions as a unit on many things. What house to buy, what to eat, what entertainment to consume etc. Your hostile reaction only shows the wedge that politics place between people. Politics are already corrupt as they recieve donations from entities that fund all sides. Again, not really a porn watcher, and I am happy part of a family unit. These are just my findings from seeing how the world operates. Porn is a weapon on the mind. I see many young men struggle with thier sense of self worth and yes many of them have abhorent views of women. There was a stage in porn where there was lots of violent chocking and degredation. Now they have moved on to incenst fantacies. A quick check of pornhubs front page will show you this. You dont need to consume content to be aware of it. Adhominum attacks are not a great approach to discussion. This is a conspiracy community and we should be respectful to one another. I suspect you have been sent here to be disruptive by your tone and hostile nature. Please note this is not r/thedonald and we dont need to be brigaded and politically rededucated. You should actually open your mind up and accept that we all have different life experiences and opinions and not everyone who is different from you deserves to be personally attacked. I hope you find something here that sets you on a new spiritual and intellectual path. All the best. </p>

<p>Wasn&#39;t it the conservative/capitalist system always trying to undermine and destroy workers unions to keep the wages low</p>

<p>It&#39;s not to keep wages low.  It&#39;s to keep your own business, that you own, in your own hands without someone else having veto power on what you&#39;re going to or slowing down reaction time, or making simple decisions complex.</p>

<p>Really cutthroat companies actually try to encourage unions in their competitors, because it&#39;s a good way to eliminate the competition.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, it varies by area. Out here in the Midwest companies are begging for people at the 15/hr range, which isn&#39;t huge but also isn&#39;t nothing.</p>

<p>Then you have the laws that make it <em>illegal</em> to build small houses, and it gets worse from there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nah, Ordoliberalism/Ordoliberalism in Westdeutschland did foster other structures to stabilize wages, but then, curiously, they imported the Turks etc. exactly when the US did their thing, the civil rights movement and various legislative adaptations, meanwhile Britain/UK ... the islands did the same with their economy, the big Empire, block-like union based production held up to the end of the 70ies and then zack, Thatcher. Luckily they found oil afterwards, the Germans found free labor (Ossis) and the US found Greenspan and his secret Chinese &quot;Schuldenquelle&quot;. </p>

<p>I probably see ghosts or something, but the parallels are becoming eerily visible the older I get.</p>

<p>is larry flynt jewish? were bob guccione or hugh hefner jewish? jewish overrepresentation in the pornography industry is a topic worthy of discussion, but the language you are using here paints with too broad of a brush. incidentally, it also leaves you open to the charge that you believe that all or most ethnic jews (irrespective of their religious affiliation or lack thereof) support the pornography industry.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Insults aside if the woman in the relationship is better poilitically versed than her husband or even her gay partner whatever the household situation is, she should should be able through discussion be able to convince the rest of the household on why they as a family unit should vote for candidate X. A household should make decisions as a unit on many things. What house to buy, what to eat, what entertainment to consume etc. Your hostile reaction only shows the wedge that politics place between people. Politics are already corrupt as they recieve donations from entities that fund all sides. Again, not really a porn watcher, and I am happy part of a family unit. These are just my findings from seeing how the world operates. Porn is a weapon on the mind. I see many young men struggle with thier sense of self worth and yes many of them have abhorent views of women. There was a stage in porn where there was lots of violent chocking and degredation. Now they have moved on to incenst fantacies. A quick check of pornhubs front page will show you this. You dont need to consume content to be aware of it. Adhominum attacks are not a great approach to discussion. This is a conspiracy community and we should be respectful to one another. I suspect you have been sent here to be disruptive by your tone and hostile nature. Please note this is not r/thedonald and we dont need to be brigaded and politically rededucated. You should actually open your mind up and accept that we all have different life experiences and opinions and not everyone who is different from you deserves to be personally attacked. I hope you find something here that sets you on a new spiritual and intellectual path. All the best. </p>
