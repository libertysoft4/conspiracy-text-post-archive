<p>This was one of the most repeated talking points of the election, over and over we heard about her secret speeches to Goldman Sachs, the implication being she had shady Wall Street ties and would do them good once she was in office. This bill is what doing them good looks like.<br/>
Don&#39;t take my word on it, hear Trump himself explain her shady financial Wall Street ties:  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Then, when she left, she made $21.6 million giving speeches to Wall Street banks and other special interests – in less than 2 years – secret speeches that she does not want to reveal to the public.<br/>

<p>I don&#39;t care about saying Hillary would have been different, but more than the line of &quot;she&#39;s an elitist with and she&#39;s in Wall Street&#39;s pocket!&quot; was a massive deceit. The elites most certainly still got theirs. The man acted like their enemy to get votes. And now here we have <em>an incredible deal</em>, a gift just in time for Christmas.</p>

<p>You think this Trump/Russia BS would have been continued if HRC had won? Hell now. Do you see how they are now trying to say Jill Stein was also a Russian patsy? It&#39;s a political tool...to divide the populace and to slander the opposition as patsy&#39;s. Also- Bush was a Neocon warmonger just like HRC, he isn&#39;t a different faction at all. </p>

<p>The aftermath of 9/11 being what it was, and the FBI playing their passive part in determining that it was Al Qaida and not an internal plot, is what this has to do. Mueller was appointed in order to ensure a certain outcome. </p>

<p>Of course it would have. She certainly would not have stopped it, or could stop it even if she wanted to. Comey certainly didn&#39;t do her any favors. The Intel community assessment on Russian interference was released while Obama was still president. It didn&#39;t suddenly ramp up because of Trump in office. </p>

<p>This isn&#39;t really about any of that though. This is about the fact that 500k+ Dem voters who voted Obama in &#39;12 voted Stein in &#39;16 in States like Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Ohio. It&#39;s about tar and feathering 3rd party candidates like Stein in an attempt to reign people back into the 2 party Duopolistic paradigm. </p>

<p>I mean, that&#39;s fair. But 9/11 isn&#39;t just an r/conspiracy thing...it&#39;s like, the big one that introduces most people to the rabbit hole. Since you are a skeptic, I ask you to take 30 seconds of your time and watch this video of WTC 7 collapsing...it was supposedly caused by an unchecked office fire on only 5 floors of the building, caused by debris from WTC 1 and 2...yet it collapsed, simultaneously, into its&#39; own footprint. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s ok. I&#39;m not mad, you seem cool, I just disagree with you. </p>

<p>I&#39;m a native New Yorker. I actually saw the towers burning although I was miles away (wasn&#39;t even on Manhattan actually, but you could see it far away.) </p>

<p>I know people from the FDNY and NYPD who were up close. The status of the structural integrity of the building was known by them - it had to be - because that affected the status of rescue operations. They knew 7 was seriously compromised before it fell, it didn&#39;t come as a surprise when it came down. </p>

<p>Nor am I mad at you. I appreciate the casual tone/demeanor. I&#39;m merely trying to show you the evidence that not all is as it seems... </p>

<p>Here&#39;s a video with FDNY members actually talking about Building 7 and the Molten Steel they saw recovered from the debris field-<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNR6Kbg5jJ8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNR6Kbg5jJ8</a></p>

<p>And returning back to WTC 7...there&#39;s absolutely no way that an average office fire, which burns at 870 degrees Celsius, could melt or even weaken Steel support beams that melt at a temperature of 1370 degrees Celsius. WTC 7 collapsed at free fall speeds, as acknowledge by NIST itself. This would require not only the structural support columns on those floors, but throughout the entire 47 story building as well as its foundation to be destroyed before it would collapse like that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t watch the video right now. </p>

<p>But as for the NIST and free fall speed, they didn&#39;t say it collapsed at free fall, but 40% longer - it did reach gravitational acceleration at one point. During the middle of the collapse. </p>

<p>Part of the problem for me with 9/11 has always been my familiarity with Manhattan, and that section. &quot;The city that never sleeps&quot; is an appropriate nickname. There&#39;s always people around, it&#39;s not some sleepy place. </p>

<p>Rigging skyscrapers there with explosives is not something which could have been done incognito. It would have been a major endeavor. And nobody noticed the crew doing this? There was security, not to mention some tenants, working round the clock.</p>

<p>And how wasn&#39;t the demolition material disrupted, or set off prematurely, by the explosions from the planes? Why would they fly planes into buildings rigged with explosives? Why didn&#39;t they fly the planes into something else, then just blow up the buildings, maximizing damage, and receiving increased benefits from even more fear and outrage? Instead they went for a plan with more risk and less reward? That doesn&#39;t make any sense. </p>

<p>This video explains how NIST did indeed eventually admit the building fell at free fall, as did my previous video linked, if this is the wrong video please let me know and I <em>will</em> make sure to get you the one that does confirm it, though I am sure this is it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>All corporations will get the same tax cut. Millions of small businesses are incorporated or want to be. Millions of people in the US work for or own a small business. So, yes, I&#39;m for cutting their taxes and freeing up revenue so they can stay in business and grow. Are you against small businesses or <em>are you just ignorant of what the cut actually is?</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p><em>It absolutely is true</em>. lol, just because it goes against you worldview doesn&#39;t make it not true. It&#39;s a corporate tax cut, dude. Do some research into, and I don&#39;t mean looking at only leftist/Marxist publications like the links you&#39;ve provided. Look into how many small businesses are incorporated in the US, and look at how many people work at or own a small business. </p>

<p>Yes, big corporations will benefit as well, because they have the money to hire lawyers for write-offs and such... But, maybe now that small businesses will have more money, they too can hire good lawyers who can get them write-offs, as well.</p>

<p>Your logic is the equivalent of saying a gun needs to be banned because you can shoot yourself (bad - corporations get more money), while failing to state that a gun can also protect you from someone trying to attack you (good - small businesses will get a tax break).</p>

<p>Seriously...</p>

<p>You think this Trump/Russia BS would have been continued if HRC had won? Hell no.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course it would have. She certainly would not have stopped it, or could stop it even if she wanted to. Comey certainly didn&#39;t do her any favors. The Intel community assessment on Russian interference was released while Obama was still president. It didn&#39;t suddenly ramp up because of Trump in office. </p>

<p>Do you see how they are now trying to say Jill Stein was also a Russian patsy? </p>

<p>That&#39;s old. Jill Stein was in Christopher Steele&#39;s dossier, where he alleged she was working for Putin.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not a 9/11 truther, so we&#39;re going to disagree here. </p>
