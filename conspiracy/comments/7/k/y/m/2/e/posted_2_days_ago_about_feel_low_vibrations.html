        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Well nothing has really changed in that time, I only feel this low rumbling vibration (not a noise) outside on my patio (I love live in northern VA just outside of D.C. And not terrible far from the pentagon) and vibrations are very steady at times feeling slightly more faint.. if anything strong at night, I smoke cigarettes out here. In my zen ya know. Anyway, a few hours ago things got weird quick, a helicopter flew right up in my neighborhood, like I mean the did real James Bond like close to the ground and just over my neighbors house 3 house down VERY CLOSE, part of me was really scared but I figured it must be them training because I have seen this helicopter fly over before it&#39;s not a stranger but today is seemed like it was looking for something (in my head, these fucking vibrations) well that was a few hours ago and it&#39;s not in my neighborhood now but I hear it near by, again hours later which is unusual for sure. Hearing LOTS of police activity over the past hour, like sirens are passing by at least once every 5 minutes. Also sounds like a tons of motorcycles are buzzing around and on top of this I hear what I would say is a leaf blower in the distance, serperate from the heli. </p>

<p>Light vibration still here too. </p>

<p>It all seems a little wild but no one is out of their home worried or like that, I feel like nova is used occasion busy nights but for me it&#39;s the vibration that makes me wonder if something bigger is at play. </p>

<p>Not near a metro btw</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can you hear them too?  I ask because my youngest brother was on a 6 month assignment in Windsor Ontario a couple years ago.  He felt a vibration late at night for a while, then it started to ring in his ears.  He came home for Christmas in 2015 and couldn&#39;t sleep, he said it is like the thing people have with Niagra Falls, they get used to it and it is bizarre without it.  I told him he was losing his mind, and he invited me up for a week.  First couple of days nothing.  Then this feeling, at first once in a while, then by the time I left constant.  He was ok with the noise, just couldn&#39;t get a handle on it.  By day 6, however, it made me feel off kilter.  I could hear it but not hear it if that makes sense.  I felt it in my ears, and it was almost disorienting.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great question, definitely there is no sound with the vibration tonight with all the commotion it’s hard to tell, interested if the heli will be out. Interesting your brough up ringing I did have a listen when I came in from outside, walked the bathroom and shut the door and it was very faint. Wouldn’t say it’s unheard of for me to have an occasional ring depending on the pressure in the air </p>

<p>I did hear a helo earlier, around 9:30, but wasn&#39;t obnoxiously loud.  I haven&#39;t heard any police sirens at all tonight. </p>

<p>Not saying I doubt you, but I&#39;m not hearing what you are.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The low rumbling is happening where I&#39;m at. I&#39;m in a first ring suburb of a major metro, and the fucking rumbling is super noticeable. Idiots I ask about this just say, &quot;oh yeah man, that&#39;s the ice cracking&quot;, or &quot;just the trains, nothing else&quot;. Just want to punch these jacksticks in the mouth.</p>

<p>Some nights the shit resonates in my bedroom, sounds like a super low frequency emission of a broken subwoofer next to my bed. I whip up pissed-off and go walk outside and stand there and just listen to it. A bedroom community, normally you can hear a pin drop, so the sounds are fucking <em>worse</em>.</p>

<p>Anyway, yeah, not a fan. And we also get the low, fast copters going from the city area to south of metro outer ring farmland. Every day. And they&#39;re go through two flight paths of regional busy airports. Loud, fast, unmarked helicopters, flyin&#39; like assholes.</p>

<p>In all seriousness, the rumbling could have a number of different causes. Wind farms, some massive generator or roof-top machine that runs all night, and created a low-freq hum over longer distances, etc? One time I did notice a different bass-rumbling sound that went on for a week was a series of train engines idling like 3/4 mile away. Super annoying, I had thoughts of dragging that poor bastard conductor from his rig, and ghostie that fucker down the rails, ala Silver Streak.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Spidy senses lead me to reason mechanical noise is being employed by abet agencies to distract from the tunneling. Either way, almost positive ground hum is deep excavation, especially in regards to reported explosions, PG and exposure of both purported and documented tunnels - some to even network throughout the continent.</p>

<p>I know the area well, question : Did they ever run a Metro leg out to Tysons Corner, and could this be it? Of course, I don&#39;t mean to downplay everything else for something so mundane. That&#39;s a lot of shit going on for sure.</p>

I tried looking into seismographs but could only really get maps of previous earthquake locations over 2.5 I’m think this would be much lower that that, long duration earth quakes would not be unheard of for the part of the coast based on what I leaned about the fault we live near,</p>
