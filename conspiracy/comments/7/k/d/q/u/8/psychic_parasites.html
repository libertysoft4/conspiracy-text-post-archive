        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The Illuminati and Occult are psychic third eye brain intruding parasites. They steal energy from people and mentally terrorize their victims. They work in large groups and target individuals. Their leaders are fallen angels and royal and noble families manage these fallen angels. Angels and fallen angels have affinities with aspects of nature and biology. They are ruthless, murderous, sadistic, lying, false accusing, psychopaths. They invade minds and dictate lies onto people. They all hide behind religion and condemn their innocent victims as sinners. The Illuminati is their false light upward pyramid and the occult is their downward false dark pyramid. Those in the middle operate on both sides and are the most deceptive. They are the Illusionati. The Illuminati consume human blood both spiritually and physically. The Occult consume human flesh both spiritual and physical. That is the forbidden fruit. The Illuminati and Occult are psychic trespassers. They are dead inside and they leave their bodies which they call astral projection and trespass on others to steal energy. They are using technology to enhance their demonic telepathy like Chemtrails, HAARP, and the electronic grid. Their psychic abilities are demonic and satanic. They are not natural. Don&#39;t be deceived into thinking they are superior because they are not.</p>

<p>How to fight them. If you fight them they will attack you in large numbers. Stability is the key. I am tormented by them 24/7. They attack me daily with armies. Its not fun. Otherwise learn to keep away from them. They are extremely violent and evil.</p>

<p>The air is a like a pond and vibrations are like a stone thrown into the pond creating ripples and effects. Thoughts, the written word, the spoken word, and emotions are the vibrations and ripples in the sea of the atmosphere. Words are like swords or words can even be like medicine. Vibrations are weapons if used correctly. After tears comes the rain, after righteous anger comes thunder, and after joy comes sunshine. These are some of the mysteries of creation. This knowledge expands understanding. This understanding enables power. Having the will to fight is necessary to win against an opponent. The key in spiritual warfare is stability with willpower. Some refer to willpower as faith, confidence, or even the force or chi. Martial artists use the &quot;Kaia&quot; sound as a spiritual technique to enhance their physical attacks and strikes. This also correlates with vocal vibrations when combating wicked spirits. A strong vibration can cast wicked spirits into the underworld like a hammer hitting a nail.</p>

<p>The Ju in Jujutsu refers to gentle and flexible. The gentle approach is underestimated and is subtle. This enables a person to maneuver and adapt with their enemies attacks and motions. This technique is most useful in written warfare. When you face written opposition the enemy often creates an opening for more attacks through their own words. This is mental Jujutsu. The law of motion states that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. That means if you release energies from you body into the atmosphere they must have an equal and opposite reaction in the atmosphere. This carries over to the theory of sonics and the transmission of mechanical energy. The body is a biomechanical source of energy and vocalized words and emotions are the most powerful forces that the body transmits. Applying understanding and willpower to these natural concepts enhances a persons influences. This is sonic wave warfare. </p>

<p>EDIT</p>

<p>PARASITES DEMAND LOVE AND FORGIVENESS and falsely accuse you if you refuse or call them out on this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jesuits and underwordly occult members use defilement, desecration, slander, and blasphemy or disrespect for attacks.</p>

<p>Witches use seduction sex. They trespass on people if they have sexual energies because they feed off it. Witches are sexual sadists. They create energetic knots, binds, and chains in the physiology. They curse and slander people too in order to break down a persons spirit.</p>

<p>Freemasons and Kabbalists are builders. They construct psychic temples for idols like the fallen angels. They create mind control programs made up deceptions. Luciferian Freemasons are insane liars and brainwash people with these lies. They invade minds and drill lies into minds. They create mental walls, barriers, and blockages to keep society in ignorance.</p>

<p>Nazi Illuminati are militant and work with Amazon women which are also sexual sadists. Nazis use oppressive sex magic on people and are like pimps using sex gangster Amazons. They are also false teachers that make up insane and irrational teachings to attempt to incorporate their wickedness with nature.</p>

<p>Alchemists are trained in chemicals and the human physiology. They trespass on bodies and hack into their physiology. They work with foods and drugs. They engineered vaccines which are designed to target the nervous system which weakens a persons spiritual armor or electromagnetic field.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just meditate. Speak my truth. Make (not forcibly, ha) people laugh. I sing and dance. I rid myself of parasites in my own life. Because I don&#39;t think that some people are even conscious of their parasitic behavior. </p>

<p>I think some people are just assholes. </p>

<p>&quot;Forgive them father, they know not what they do.&quot; </p>

<p>Because all I know is that if you&#39;re aware of psychic powers, and you are using them to fuck up others people&#39;s, then you really don&#39;t understand your own psychic power. And that&#39;s sad to me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know, I liked your post, but the way you are reacting to comments is the antithesis of what is written above. I can see why you feel like you are being attacked 24/7, and no doubt you will probably see me as a parasite. One look at your many replies to comments and I can see that you&#39;re accusing others of what you&#39;re doing yourself. </p>

<p>I happen to agree with the idea that spiritual parasites exist and that the world is infested with them. Everyone here has spiritual parasites and that includes you. One of the manipulative behaviors these parasites exhibit is tricking the host into believing that the parasite and host&#39;s thoughts are one in the same, which can be extremely confusing and frustrating. </p>

<p>What you&#39;re showing me is that you are being tricked into believing that anyone who replies with a slight difference of opinion or a constructive piece of insight is a parasite. This is a very dangerous path. Without the ability to critically examine other opinions without feeling attacked, you in fact open yourself up to parasites that will feed on the spiritual vulnerability and victimhood that you&#39;re holding onto. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Ju in Jujutsu refers to gentle and flexible. The gentle approach is underestimated and is subtle. This enables a person to maneuver and adapt with their enemies attacks and motions. This technique is most useful in written warfare. When you face written opposition the enemy often creates an opening for more attacks through their own words. This is mental Jujutsu. The law of motion states that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Feeling attacked every time you face written opposition is a sign of a victim mentality. Not only that, but in writing this post, you willingly opened yourself up to &quot;attacks&quot; and inevitably became reactionary with every single statement that was not in exact agreement with yours. If everyone&#39;s your enemy, you will never stop being in a reactionary, fight-or-flight state. </p>

<p>&quot;For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.&quot; If this is really true, then you must admit that you invited &quot;written opposition&quot; on purpose with this post. If the comments are reflecting something back that you don&#39;t like, maybe you should examine your own behavior, not just the other person&#39;s. </p>

<p>. You can see me as a parasite doing mental Jiu Jitsu all you want. All I&#39;m asking is that you critically think about what you are saying and what others are saying. Understand that you, nor anyone else, is impermeable to false thinking.</p>

<p>I would recommend strengthening your aura (biofield) and remove any negative entities.</p>

<p>Neither do you. Just because mainstream science can&#39;t explain something, doesn&#39;t mean you automatically can, unless of course you have evidence. Do you have evidence for psychic parasites? If so, please provide it.</p>

<p>Show me some links for what you are referring to. I think I have heard of this fellow before, from what I&#39;ve seen, he just writes papers with elementary equations thrown in to wow laymen, but doesn&#39;t actually explain anything and his theories fall apart under the simplest scrutiny of people who actually have a deeper understanding of physics. Also, it is not enough for you to say, &quot;look at this guy, he knows the answers&quot;. Can <em>you</em> explain these things to me, or provide any evidence, even simple evidence to support your claims? If not, then how can you claim to have any <em>knowledge</em> of these phenomena?</p>

<p>What is WPAFB? Google search tells me that this is an airforce base. Are you telling me that you have a friend in an airforce base? Ok, not hard to believe at all. Are you telling me that your friend&#39;s unsubstantiated and unprovable claims somehow count as evidence for something? Well they objectively don&#39;t.</p>

I know, I&#39;ve seen the above ground entrances with the signs warning of &quot;authorized use of force.&quot; My friends family, have been working at this base for close to 50 years. What he told me is mind blowing, it would induce panic if it were ever to be uttered on live television. The simple fact of the matter is each member of my friends family has verrrry high clearance, and I&#39;d trust these people with my life. Good, hardworking people with families, and struggles of their own. I&#39;ve posted before about my friend and his disclosure to me. I will not name, or reveal any more than that. </p>

<p>Nothing, I never accused you of being malicious. Just gullible perhaps.</p>

<p>I can handle new information just fine, I even crave it. I just have a much higher standard for what I consider &quot;evidence&quot; or &quot;proof&quot;. Hearsay from random humans is not evidence or proof of anything.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You, my friend do not know what I know.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If what you know comes from such incredible sources such as people you happen to know, and in the form of such high standards as &quot;hearsay&quot;, then I doubt you truly know anything. Or your definition of the word &quot;know&quot; is wildly different from mine and the dictionary&#39;s.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Just look up Archons and that&#39;s the basic idea of what&#39;s going on</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ve read about Archons and the Demiurge on more than one occasion. I have yet to see any actual evidence for either. I can find tons of things written about all this stuff. Just never any <em>evidence</em>.</p>

<p>On another note, you can do the same (blocking them from visiting your house) during sleep you are most vulnerable. You can also attack them back if you are able to AP. </p>

<p>I read somewhere that lining your room with Aluminum foil would help. But who wants a room full of aluminum foil.... there’s other methods I’ve forgotten but just research how to stop AP attacks or spiritual attacks. You will find it</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you may be suffering from some form of paranoid schizophrenia.</p>

<p>Please don&#39;t read this and think that I&#39;m saying this to discredit or put you down in anyway, that couldn&#39;t be further from the truth.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not a psychiatrist or psychologist either, so take my opinion for what it is worth, but something about your post and comments is giving me a gut feeling.</p>

<p>I do have experience being hyper paranoid before, so I can kind of understand the thought process and feelings that make these sort of things &quot;make sense&quot; to the person experiencing them.</p>

<p>I think you should consider getting some help / an evaluation from somebody you believe you can trust.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>hey OP, I&#39;m sorry you are being tormented, and I will pray.</p>

<p>there is one God, he is more powerful than all other beings. He sent his son Jesus, and he showed us that Jesus is sent by God by raising him from the dead, by performing many miracles in the sight of eyewitnesses, and by giving us prophecy that Jesus would come many centuries before he came. Because God is good, and because he is powerful, he is able to preserve his word. He has left Scripture for us, and since the beginning mankind has not been able to separate us from that Scripture. Mankind has certainly spoken ill of the Scripture, and used the Scripture for evil, but no man can undo the work of God, and so the Scripture remains. I know that you do not believe, but please understand, there are many forces acting on your mind. Please, call out to God, who is good, who hears you. There is a good God, and there is no reason to be separated from him! Please seek him, so that your torment and your troubles can begin to be healed. You&#39;re awesome OP. I hope you are okay. See ya</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, same. He seems to think anything regarding spirituality is evil, that&#39;s a pretty sad mindset. Worship (religions) is evil not spirituality.</p>

<p>Spirituality can be explained by solid math and science. Check out Dan Winters work.</p>

<p>Kundalini leads to an expanded state of consciousness, bliss and love if you are able to control it.</p>

<p>I&#39;m at the same spot as you bro, I&#39;ve also not taken the plunge yet i&#39;m still in a researching phase, haha :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes they would. But there is no evidence they found anything. Every time someone brings up the CIA, they just say, &quot;they looked into it&quot;, as if that&#39;s prove. They never tell you that the CIA found jack fucking shit. Sure, maybe they covered up what they found. But until you have any evidence that isn&#39;t pure speculation, this is a meaningless discussion and common sense and occams razor take precedence.</p>

<p>What do I have to gain from spreading disinformation?</p>

<p>Nothing, I never accused you of being malicious. Just gullible perhaps.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m just like you, I&#39;m searching for the &quot;truth &quot; the difference is I don&#39;t run away when my ego can&#39;t handle new information.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I can handle new information just fine, I even crave it. I just have a much higher standard for what I consider &quot;evidence&quot; or &quot;proof&quot;. Hearsay from random humans is not evidence or proof of anything.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You, my friend do not know what I know.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If what you know comes from such incredible sources such as people you happen to know, and in the form of such high standards as &quot;hearsay&quot;, then I doubt you truly know anything. Or your definition of the word &quot;know&quot; is wildly different from mine and the dictionary&#39;s.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Just look up Archons and that&#39;s the basic idea of what&#39;s going on</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ve read about Archons and the Demiurge on more than one occasion. I have yet to see any actual evidence for either. I can find tons of things written about all this stuff. Just never any <em>evidence</em>.</p>
