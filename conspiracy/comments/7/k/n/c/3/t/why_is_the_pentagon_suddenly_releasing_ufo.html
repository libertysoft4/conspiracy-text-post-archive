        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>By now, everyone has seen the eye-popping NY Times article and the video that came with it. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/16/us/politics/pentagon-program-ufo-harry-reid.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/16/us/politics/pentagon-program-ufo-harry-reid.html</a>   Why?  Why now?  Why is the Pentagon all of a sudden admitting it is spending money on UFO research? Why are there multiple spottings of cigar shaped inter-stellar objects that could be  an alien spaceship, suddenly being reported on?  Why is Tom DeLonge all of a sudden being approached by former Pentagon officials to disclose UFOs?  Why is the military purposely flying squads of airplane at night in formations that can easily be mistaken as gigantic UFOs? </p>

<p>Why you ask?</p>

<p>Because they need to come up with an explanation for trillions of missing dollars.   </p>

<p>Let’s think rationally for a moment.  The UFO phenomenon has been filmed since the 1940’s when Foo Fighters were first spotted. <a href="http://worldwartwo.filminspector.com/2016/10/foo-fighters-of-world-war-ii.html">http://worldwartwo.filminspector.com/2016/10/foo-fighters-of-world-war-ii.html</a>  Over the decades there have been countless testimonies and sightings by credible sources (like military/commercial pilots) let alone hundreds and hundreds of hours of footage.  Ask anyone in the world if they know what a UFO is and they will answer yes.  Are we to believe that the strongest, the most advanced military in the world does not know everything there is to know about UFOs in 2010’s?  Are we to believe that the research into the topic only began on 2007 as according to the NYT?  Absurd!  How naïve do you have to be to believe such utter non-sense?</p>

<p>Enter the threat of the first-ever audit of the Pentagon and the DoD. <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2017-12-10/pentagon-undergo-first-ever-audit-after-decades-sloppy-accounting-and-missing-trilli">http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2017-12-10/pentagon-undergo-first-ever-audit-after-decades-sloppy-accounting-and-missing-trilli</a>   As the saying goes, they’re up the creek without a paddle.  Yes, they are missing AT LEAST $21 trillion by some estimates and as much as $29 trillion by more “sensationalistic” media outlets. <a href="http://investmentwatchblog.com/29-trillion-dollars-missing-from-pentagon-trump-calls-for-audit/">http://investmentwatchblog.com/29-trillion-dollars-missing-from-pentagon-trump-calls-for-audit/</a></p>

<p>Where did all this money go?  Well, I’d imagine some went to legit above top secret weapons research.  Now, most of these experiments probably failed, wasting trillions.  The military has every motivation to hide failed experiments while publicizing the crap out of successful ones.  Why?  Because repeated reports of failures will drive the public and Congress to doubt about funding future projects.  So they hide the unsuccessful results as much as possible.   They simply don’t want their revenue stream reduced.</p>

<p>Next?  Probably a significant amount went in to illegal operations and sensitive surveillance.  After all, you can’t actually put into accounting ledgers that we were spying on our closest allies or that we were responsible for certain insurrections in the Middle East, or that we’re actually protecting poppy fields in Afghanistan, right?   Or that we’re even spending vast resources monitoring our own population unconstitutionally.  No, no, all those things have to be off-the-books.</p>

<p>Finally, I suspect that large sums of money were embezzled or diverted to enrich the Military Industrial Complex.  All those extravagant perks don’t come cheap you know.  Who cares if the military pays $200k for an LCD monitor that costs $50 to make.  It’s all free money.  Well, to them that is, because it’s our money.</p>

<p>So, what to do?  How are the Pentagon and the DoD going to account for over $20 trillion in missing funds?  Well, you figure they’ll point to covert programs and secret development for up to $10 trillion or so.  But there’s just no way they’re going to come up with an acceptable explanation for all $20+ trillion.</p>

<p>That’s where the UFO patsy comes in.  Yes.  They are going to reveal that trillions that were actually squandered (or outright stolen) were justifiably spent on the following:
1.  To research and validate the existence of UFOs.
2.  To devise and construct early warning systems (such as a satellite network) that can detect UFOs encroaching on our space.
3.  To come up with feasible ways to defend ourselves against an unlikely but possible alien invasion.
4.  Labs and research centers dedicated to understanding how the UFOs function should they turn out to be real.
5.  Etc. etc. bla bla bla…</p>

<p>You see where they’re going with this?  When the entire planet is at stake, $10+ trillion in defense suddenly doesn’t seem so bad.   Of course, no evidence of actual development or proof of systems will ever be disclosed.  You know, national security and all.  But all this hinges on the majority of the population believing that UFO are real and that a credible threat is a possibility.  This is why more and more information will be released from the Pentagon in the coming months.  They want you to believe!</p>

<p>If you need proof of my argument, just look at the NY Times article.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the $600 billion annual Defense Department budgets, the $22 million spent on the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program was almost impossible to find.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The very first line of the article specifically states the amount spent on this program.  Why does it make such an emphasis in this insignificant amount of $22 million?  Simple.  They are trying to program us in to accepting that it is normal to spend money on UFO research.  Need more proof?  Look further down the article.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Why aren’t we spending more time and effort on this issue?” Mr. Elizondo wrote in a resignation letter to Defense Secretary Jim Mattis.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Do you see the psychological manipulation?  Do you see how the article is trying to make us believe that funding for UFO research is not only justified but absolutely necessary?</p>

<p>Don’t fall for this crap.  While I’m a firm believer in UFOs, I also know damn well that the DoD, CIA, NSA and just about every powerful agency in the country knows the full truth of UFOs.  They’ve known for decades!  They’re just trying to convince you that all that money that’s missing?  Well, that it was well spent.  They’re gonna claim they’re saving your ass from greys and reptilians so just be thankful.</p>

<p>In the coming months (and even years), the government will release more and more info on UFOs.  Do not fall for it.  It’s old news.  It’s stuff the govt has known for a long time, carefully packaged to make you think… “hmm, maybe we DO need to spend more money on UFO research and defense.”  It’s all a ruse.  It’s all a scam.  They’re just trying to cover their ass for the missing $29 trillion.  </p>

<p>This is the real “Project Blue Beam”.  It is to obfuscate and justify the trillions that have been illegally used by our own military.  </p>

<p>P.S.  Upon re-reading my post, I seem to be saying that UFOs definitely exists and the govt has been hiding it.  I am not.  I am saying the govt fully knows for sure whether they exist or not.  I do not know what they know.  All I&#39;m saying is that they are using psyop to get people to question &quot;MAYBE UFOs exists&quot;.   When enough people start questioning the existence of UFOs, their secret unaccounted $10+ trillion spent on supposed projects to verify UFOs will seem justified.  It will all be BS because they already know whether they exist or not and have known for decades.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Only thing is. Nobody gives a crap about the ufo story. Other than people into ufos. If they wanted to distract from 21 trillion. They could literally say. We lost 21 trillion and the masses could give a shit. Its over. The government could flat out say we were behind 9/11 sandyhook jfk assassination pulse night club shooting. And all it would do is garner a few peaceful protests before falling to the next #metoo scandal. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My opinion...they are using UFOs/alien stories because it is bigger than losing money.  They need a cover for the &quot;slow drip&quot; of exposure of advanced technologies and medical cures that are going to start becoming public.  If the public knew that the elites have been hiding all these new technologies/cures from the masses, they would be literally marched on and lynched on the spot.  Apparently, the elite has been buying up all the patents and been keeping stuff hidden for a century.  Why...because look how profitable it is for big pharma to keep selling medicine that only contains the symptoms of a disease.  Look how much money oil brings to the middle east.  Imagine if energy could be generated without oil and without big solar panels and without huge windmills etc...  or Cancers had cures etc...?   The elites can only hope that the public is stupid enough to think that UFOs/aliens &quot;brought&quot; this technology with them here (or that we discovered the technology along with discovering the aliens in the Antarctic. My take. </p>

<p>Do you know how much money that is?  Imagine you have a Billion Dollar Bill.  That&#39;s a lot of money right?  That would last multiple life times no matter how extravagant you are, right?</p>

<p>Now, imagine you have 29,000 of these bills.  That&#39;s how much $29 trillion is.  </p>

<p>No, people will not dismiss this.  They will want answers.  This will send a lot of people to jail.</p>

<p>I love your optimism but at best this gets to be a minor issue in political campaigns for the next few years. You really underestimate public apathy. Look at the response to the UFO article yesterday.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I unfortunately tend to agree with you here. The recent past (at the 21st century) has been so filled with &quot;scandals&quot; of awful things going on with our government, all of it sort of adding up, snowballing in the mind of the public. The public&#39;s view of the government wasn&#39;t glorious already when the century turned, but these days with everything that&#39;s happened, I think the average person that would hear the news that our government has foolishly squandered such a large amount of money would say something along the lines of &quot;Oh look, yet another example of our government being absolutely stupid&quot; and they&#39;d move on. They wouldn&#39;t realize how big of a deal it is that that much of <em>our</em> money is being blown on things completely worthless to us.  </p>

<p>$21 trillion is a <em>shit-ton</em> of money, but it&#39;s such a large number that nobody can really conceive of how much it really is, not even you or I. People will hear the number and say &quot;wow that&#39;s a lot&quot; but they won&#39;t realize how much it is. Even one trillion seconds adds up to 32,000 years, or multiple times longer than all of recorded human history. It&#39;s an inconceivably huge number.  </p>

<p>All of this to say that there&#39;s a small majority that would see it and call the incredibly smelly bullshit as they see it, but the majority wouldn&#39;t really think that it&#39;s any worse than the last big embarrassment of the US government. It&#39;s sad, but true.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great post. I&#39;m just thinking out loud here about the weekend.....</p>

<ul>
<li><p>NASA uses Google AI to discover an additional planet in a neighboring solar system (Kepler 90I, like Eath, is the 3rd planet from that solar system&#39;s main star, or sun). <a href="https://www.geek.com/science/nasa-google-ai-discover-eighth-planet-in-kepler-90-system-1725937/">https://www.geek.com/science/nasa-google-ai-discover-eighth-planet-in-kepler-90-system-1725937/</a></p></li>
<li><p>On December 16, 2017 (Saturday), the Glowing Auras and &#39;Black Money&#39; article comes out via The New York Times (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/16/us/politics/pentagon-program-ufo-harry-reid.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/16/us/politics/pentagon-program-ufo-harry-reid.html</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>Foo Fighters are the musical guest on Saturday Night Live. Playing off of OP&#39;s mention about how &#39;foo fighter&#39; was the term used by Allied aircraft pilots in World War II to describe various UFOs or mysterious aerial phenomena seen in the skies over both the European and Pacific theaters of operations, I remember noticing the first of the 2 songs they played on Saturday. Firstly, it struck me as odd that they were the musical guest because, well, it&#39;s been awhile since they were on. Secondly, their first song was a song titled, &#39;The Sky Is A Neighborhood&#39;. Red flag immediately for me. I looked up the lyrics while I was listening to it. Just taking the first couple of lyrics was telling: </p></li>
</ul>

<p>The sky is a neighborhood, So keep it down; 
The heart is a storybook, A star burned out</p>

<p>Who was the host of SNL on Saturday? Kevin Hart. He just had to admit he cheated on his wife (<a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/kevin-hart-infidelity-irresponsible/story?id=51813336">http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/kevin-hart-infidelity-irresponsible/story?id=51813336</a>). Those lyrics make A LOT of sense, considering.</p>

<ul>
<li>All the world&#39;s a stage,
And all the men and women merely players;
They have their exits and their entrances,
And one man in his time plays many parts...</li>
</ul>

    <div class="md"><p>It really is though. This is anecdotal af, but I just learned of skinwalker/sherman ranch a few weeks ago. Then I read the article this passed Saturday. Low and behold the owner of the ranch also owns Bigelow aerospace. Who happened to be spoken of in the NY Times piece? Robert Bigelow. He was contracted out, by the secret division spoken of in the article to do research into various phenomenon. He&#39;s also heavily involved with NASA. Does any of that mean anything substantial? Nah. Just that synchronicity is a weird thing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Possibly.  But my guess is that those behind the military that support Trump want people to go into space, so they want to acclimatize people into the idea that aliens have been here (in our solar system) for thousands of years.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a really interesting speculative subject, and you may be right, OP. But this phrase &quot;believe in UFO&#39;s&quot; is silly. You mean, &quot;believe that some UFO&#39;s are alien crafts,&quot; right? I spent some serious time on this subject, and the evidence is overwhelming that some of the instances have involved alien crafts and alien intelligence. You can also encounter non-human higher intelligence through the use of DMT, which I&#39;ve done. We are not alone here as humans. I really recommend reading Richard Dolan, Jacque Vallee, and Terence McKenna, and also smoking DMT yourself.</p>

<p>Need something bigger and badder to keep peoples attention away from where they do not want it.  Time to pull out the last Big Scary Card...Aliens.  </p>

<p>Natural Human Fear of the Other.</p>

<p>Would be perfect cover to sweep in and take control right after a Devastating Attack by Aliens, those who come to save people and clean up the mess will seen as heroes and be given the power to set up the New World Government.</p>

<p>The New World Government will be established as a force to combat the new threat from space.  Aliens are the one threat that could unite all people of Earth towards one single goal.</p>

<p>IMO i think there will be an attack in the coming years.  It will be an asteroid/meteor/<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_bombardment">Rod of God</a> kind of attack at first. </p>

<p>It will be passed off at first as just a random event that was missed.  We already know we can not watch the entire sky for them.  </p>

<p>Or perhaps they already know there will be a collision in the near future and there is nothing we can do to stop it at this point.  But not ones to let any crisis go to waste...they will use it and claim attack to put their plans into action.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll throw my comment in since no one will likely read it anyhow.</p>

<p>The other day, someone came in here to /conspiracy as a new account and pretty much point blank said he worked for the Navy and admitted with great detail that he worked in the Naval weather group and admitted they have been doing aerosol spraying since the mid 90&#39;s because of global warming.  </p>

<p>Not sure if that dude was being a LARP or not but his story sure did make sense and it got me thinking that it could be part of a much larger campaign where shills are being put forth as pawns in a much larger conspiracy to get ahead of the missing trillions story by showing some cards on some low hanging conspiracies. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve always said that the chemtrails are likely weather modification because the government knows something scary about our environment and instead of panicking the public, they spend billions on deflecting sunlight to help cool the earth.  It&#39;s possible a good chunk of the $$ is going in for something to be helpful and not really devious.  </p>

<p>Just a thought and since it matched a bit of this UFO narrative, I thought I would chime in with my opinion about how the guvvy is going to stay ahead of this....</p>

<p>They were pointing out technicalities that no one would ever give a crap about.  We literally had 100 former secret op scientists here in under an hour when he posted his thread.  I dunno.  No one ever gets treated like him here.  Ever.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m saying that it seems pretty likely for a large portion of conspiracy theorists to be military. It doesn&#39;t surprise me at all that someone that knows about Navy ranks would be reading that post.</p>

<p>And AG2 does indeed seem to be a very low rank in the Navy so it seems that he&#39;s right. On the other hand it&#39;s also possible that he&#39;s just passing on the opinions of his superiors on global warming. The reason why I was skeptical is that any real scientist would be able to quantify the stuff they&#39;re talking about, this guy just talked in a broad strokes manner to please conspiracy theorists. And it&#39;s also possible that he (correctly) assumed that most people wouldn&#39;t be able to make sense of his documents.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good post op. Here is my 2 cents. Maybe tptb have been building a space fleet or interstellar craft? That would have cost trillions to build. Maybe all the science fiction from the last 25 years or so is somewhat true?</p>

<p>I&#39;m thinking along the lines of the Stargate TV show. </p>

<p>I find it interesting that for years tptb had people convinced ufo&#39;s were fantasy and when people started to consider that they might in fact be real we are at a point that most here would consider it a false flag aka project bluebeam.</p>

<p>In effect if tptb were trying to keep the existence of alien life a secret they have succeeded. If the aliens showed themselves tomorrow people wouldn&#39;t believe it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s the issue with your post: no one gives a fuck about the $21T with or without justification from the government. Realize that the government doesn&#39;t need to justify that loss to us because normal people don&#39;t care. You&#39;re thinking that everyone has the &quot;conspiratorial mind&quot; but most people will just glance at that stat, momentarily think &quot;that&#39;s fucked up&quot; and go on with their day.</p>

<p>To think that the government would go as far as reveal the existence of UFOs after decades to justify unaccounted money to conspiracy theorists is absurd. </p>

<p>I think the most likely reason for disclosure would be the upcoming civilian expansion into space. Previously it was the domain of governments and militaries but once civilians go up there it might be harder to deny.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the input.  I think you&#39;re missing the main point of my theory.  It&#39;s not that they (meaning the Pentagon) believe that there will be any real damage to them for having $21 trillion be unaccounted for.  It&#39;s that any real investigation or audit is going to reveal that they are involved in COUNTLESS illegal activities.  Activities which will send people to jail and cut funding for the military.  </p>

<p>The point I was trying to make is that a convenient way out for them, without having protests and riots, is to simply say &quot;We spent that money researching UFOs and building a defense against it&quot;  The end.  We, the normal people, really can&#39;t comprehend just how much $21~$29 trillion is.  There is no way in hell that amount of money is unaccounted for.  They all know where it went.  Illegal activities.   All I&#39;m saying is that they&#39;re trying to hide it by looking like they&#39;re protecting us... from aliens.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve spent a lot of time pondering where the money goes. I think there is more than one answer here. UFOs are almost certainly a real phenomena that have happened and scared them (maybe it never scared level 3, maybe only level 2). Massive corruption and hush money is another part. They use the corruption to further the agenda of the secret government. </p>

<p>They also maintain at least a 30 year time shift in aerospace tech. Meaning you can point out a tech they are allegedly developing now in aerospace and know with some certainty they perfected it almost 30 years ago. They do that for a number of reasons. </p>

<p>I think they also built lots of underground facilities all over the world for apocalyptic situations. Those would cost a lot. </p>

<p>Maybe they even built bases on the moon. I have no idea. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t understand all of what they do but it&#39;s obvious something is rotten in Denmark. </p>

<p>I first thought that you were saying that UFOs are fake.. etc..</p>

<p>But I think I understand.  You&#39;re saying that&#39;s a military vehicle and the Pentagon fully knows what it is, but they are presenting it as a possible UFO.  Thus, cementing my theory.  Yes?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting.  But I do have a question.  If the Pentagon wanted to release a video (which they obviously did) to make people question whether UFOs are real or not, why would they release a video of a known vehicle?  Wouldn&#39;t they just release a totally top secret unknown vehicle like the TR3B?</p>

If it’s the latter I honestly wouldn’t even care as long as we get the disclosure and the tech.

    <div class="md"><p>You know when you say missing trillions it hasn&#39;t actually gone missing. Even if is true that money has likely been ploughed back into the economy.</p>

<p>Your whole argument is off too. You say that the top secret projects probably failed. Why? Because it helps you push your opinionated agenda.</p>

<p>I&#39;d hope if trillions has been pushed into black projects they&#39;d have drones which can do what all these videos say they do. </p>

When age does conspiracy theories make it into the nyt as actual truths we are talking about a conspiracies being normalized. This means that truths and untruths become indistinguishable for the time being which makes possible for the powers to be further confuse and bamboozle us. I think it&#39;s a way for Trump and company to make us look over there... While the magic happens over here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe that video taken from the jet just showed some kind of rare, natural phenomenon (I dunno, maybe like ball lightning or something else).  Didn&#39;t the report say the &quot;object&quot; didn&#39;t show up on radar, so it sounds like it was not metallic and just a rare kind of weather phenomenon.</p>

<p>Since the universe is so vast, I do believe intelligent life exists somewhere out there around other stars, but, like Carl Sagan said, we haven&#39;t seen any good (or even bad) evidence yet that aliens have visited the Earth.  The distance between stars is enormous, so enormous that when the Andromeda Galaxy &quot;collides&quot; with our own Galaxy in the far, distant future, no stars from either galaxy are expected to touch.  Stars are incredibly far apart from each other.  </p>

<p>Also there are over 100 Billion stars in our galaxy alone.  It&#39;s entirely possible no one knows we&#39;re here, like trying to find a needle in a haystack.  Even if some  intelligent aliens have discovered our incredibly faint radio or TV signals from their home planets, we don&#39;t know if faster-than-light travel is possible.  If it is possible somehow, it must require mind-boggling amounts of energy.</p>

<p>Our radio and TV signals have been traveling out into the interstellar ether for only about 80 years now, so the farthest the signals could have traveled by now is 80 light years in a galaxy that is 100 MILLION light years wide.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This will be a distraction...this narrative will start slowly building steam and MSM will start announcing small reports about unidentifiable objects around the world appearing or being found after being hidden away for so long. All, just to distract and change the narrative from the massive crimes the deep state has been perpetrating against the citizens of the world...not just America!</p>

<p>Why? To explain the soon-to-be-exposed existence of major technologies and medical cures that have been hidden from us by the elite cabal for almost a century! </p>

<p>Just watch the news. More and more about aliens being found or hidden away will be reported. </p>

<p>Why aliens? Because the elite think this will explain all the &quot;new&quot; technologies that will become public soon. They want us to believe the aliens brought us this technology. Because the public will want to lynch all elites once we find out they had cures to diseases our families died from too young, that they could generate power without petroleum products etc... so they want us to believe that aliens has brought the “new” technology. </p>

<p>Why now?  Because the noose it tightening around the cabal.  Some in the cabal are trying to negotiate their freedom/privacy/power/whatever...and they are using their hidden cache of technology/cures as bargaining chips.  Will not work.  The white hats are going to release everything.  </p>

<p>Wait for it...the shock will not come soon, but a slow drip so it does not cause mobs out for lynching. But don&#39;t be distracted.</p>

My theory is that some of that enormous amount of money was used for ufo research/projects that we don&#39;t know about yet.
