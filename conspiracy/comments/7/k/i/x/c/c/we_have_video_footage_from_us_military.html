<p>I believe the 2nd amendment would be more useful if we had a completely separate People’s Militia. Like an additional national guard, but with tighter restrictions on where they can deploy, as to stop racist white mobs from organizing against black people in the past. </p>

<p>It would give Americans a sense of unity, a way to come together and for sure that Your community is there for you. If the federal government went overtly rogue, if the police force openly lynches blacks, if the army kills citizens at home, we’d have a local force against it. </p>

<p>Or if we needed to protest without the police trying to disrupt it, we’d have an organized deterrent. And yes, deterrents work, that’s literally the foundation of our foreign policy. Deterrence via hegemony. Hence hanging a people’s militia. </p>

<p>Well, I know this is late but wow. Ya had me up to here, then went completely off the deep end.  I support everyone having a gatling gun strapped around them, and also a people&#39;s militia. Because that&#39;s (clearly) how the 2nd amendment was intended</p>

<p>Look at the differences between how police interacted with groups at the Dakota pipeline versus those who were armed at the Oregon Wildlife Refuge. A gun demands respect, and a bunch of people with guns would make anyone question if it is worth putting their life on the line to enforce whatever order was given from their superiors.</p>

<p>If nobody at an assembly has guns to present a legitimate threat, police can do whatever they want, and the military would never get involved because the issue would be dealt with by domestic police.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would say yes in general but the important difference is that police are conditioned day in day out at their jobs to view the average American Citizen as a threat, meaning they would be much more willing to follow through on some bullshit order passed off as justification for a domestic power grab. Just look at the amount of police brutality and killing videos that are being uncovered now for proof of the direction local PD&#39;s are moving in.</p>

<p>Military on the other hand, I&#39;m sure view coming back to US soil as a great stress relief. Their families are here and the enemy is back &#39;over there&#39;. For police the enemy is here in America because that is what they are used to dealing with.</p>

<p>If the situation ever got bad enough that people were in open combat with law enforcement trying to push through some bullshit legal justification for a power grab, I would much rather the military get involved as well instead of just the police.</p>

<p>In my mind, those statements kind of contradict each other. There are <strong>billions and billions</strong> of dollars in Las Vegas. Bad publicity and lawsuits are something that these casinos <strong>with a ton of power [and money]</strong> can easily afford to sweep away.</p>

<p>Seriously man? This is American. Any Joe Blowhard either at the Hotel or in the music concert crowd will jump at the chance to scrap a couple $$$ grand from Mandalay. The insurance company would be paying out, but still, it&#39;s the insurance company&#39;s dollar and they&#39;d risk losing their coverage if they do unlawyerly dumb shit like needlessly release video footage that opens them up to lawsuits.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right now Mandalay Bay isn&#39;t the one making the claims about Paddock. It&#39;s the FBI, right? </p>

<p>So let&#39;s say that someone who stayed at the Hotel in either the rooms above or below Paddock&#39;s room, decide that they&#39;re going to sue Mandalay Bay for trauma. They&#39;ll probably sue for damages in civil court stating that Mandalay Bay didn&#39;t do enough to prevent Paddock&#39;s actions...right? But see, Mandalay Bay hasn&#39;t exactly complied and isn&#39;t the one who made the accusation against Paddock, so essentially said plaintiff would have to argue their case by proving the FBI&#39;s story.</p>

<p>At which point, my guess is that a lot of cases will be thrown out or negotiated to a small manageable sum that the insurance companies can live with.</p>

<p>On the other hand, let&#39;s say that Mandalay Bay releases the footage like you say. The plaintiff just uses their video footage and argues from there. If they don&#39;t release the footage though, then there&#39;s a lot more hoops, hurdles and political territory you have to wade through just to get a couple grand. It&#39;ll still happen, as you say, but it just won&#39;t be a floodgate of lawsuits instead of the handful of legally well-connected Americans.</p>

<p>I just explained to you the legal argument. You can disagree with me, but I doubt you&#39;ve spent a year of your life doing paralegal work and instead of providing an argument for your beliefs you just keep asserting your feelings.</p>

<p>The video will be analyzed sooner or later. The only reason to withhold it from the public is because of speculation that some imaginary tourist will pick a different hotel for their upcoming Vegas trip, which MGM could easily mitigate by discounting the room by $20. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>1800 security cameras at the hotel, not 1 second of footage has been released of Paddock in the hotel. Considering how much hardware was in his room it&#39;s understandable questions are being asked.</p>

<p>People here try to excuse it by the hotel not wanting to release it, which is obvious. However the police/FBI obviously has all of it and it&#39;s usually them or council who release videos. Lawyers representing people who are suing the hotel are meeting resistance from the police.</p>

<p>So, at least there is 100% a conspiracy to protect the hotel from damages. That part is not even up for debate at this point. It&#39;s obvious.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Except for this fact that there&#39;s no real reason to be skeptical of three independent agencies claiming it was him. Demanding that Mandalay Bay should release any footage they might have to &quot;stop conspiracy theorists&quot; is like demanding the government prove the Earth isn&#39;t flat. Not like releasing CCTV would even stop these stupid ideas from proliferating. They&#39;d just claim something stupid like it was made on a stage by the secret government that controls all. </p>

<p>The facts just speak for themselves. If you genuinely think the employees of Mandalay Bay or Las Vegas PD would go along with a mass shooting of their friends and family, you clearly don&#39;t know much about how the real world works. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s harder to explain why a well off middle aged white man would kill anyone, let alone perpetrate an attack like this. It&#39;s easy to see why a Muslim would do something like this, because Muslims have an extensive history of this exact type of violence. </p>

<p>If it was a twenty something white guy, you&#39;d have your little gotcha moment, but this attack defies all logic and stunk even before we knew the identity of the alleged shooter.</p>

<p>All of this is unimportant though, because a couple of people don&#39;t speak for the entire sub.</p>

<p>But most importantly - as I mentioned - there is not a single good reason to release, so why would they? No benefit but a chance for risk. Any reputable legal team would lean on the side of caution. </p>

<p>But from the viewpoint of the Mandalay Bay they do not exist to rub the public&#39;s shoulders and play the part of detective to help everyone get closure on the tragedy. They exist solely and unequivocally to make as much money as humanly possible. Any competent legal/PR team would release as little photo documentation to the public as required by law. It&#39;s just smart business, period. Makes complete sense from a business point of view to be dark on any and all imagery. </p>

It was the worst mass shooting event in history, not really equivalent to just demanding records from some random case.   Kind of a special situation.  These are societal questions at this point.

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe they don&#39;t want to show how easy it apparently was to load a luggage cart or two with gun cases and nobody batted an eye because it&#39;s America. I mean, Vegas has shooting guns as a <em>notable tourist attraction</em>, there&#39;s conventions and expos in that town every single week and I&#39;m sure more than a couple involve the arms industry. Maybe releasing footage of a bored, psychotic upper-middle class boomer pulling a hyperviolent Michael Douglas in Falling Down would be unsafe on an irrational, impressionable and increasingly economically unsecured American public.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t get what questioning this lack of footage hopes to accomplish. Keep the debate away from guns? I&#39;m not saying he wasn&#39;t a rogue asset giving some bad salt, but withholding hotel cctv footage seems like a pretty petty thing to pursue if that&#39;s the story you want to believe.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m someone who thinks the UFO video is a joke.  Am I alone or does all the chatter in the video just seem too rehearsed?  </p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen a few vids in my time of military and I&#39;ve never heard pilots speak so clearly for one, and two, speak to each other as if they&#39;re surf buddies from Maui.</p>

<p>This is why and how some people can think of all the project bluebeam.  A setup all too easily done with some choice &quot;leaks&quot; almost by people in the media and in politics.</p>

<p>Politics, John fucking Podesta no less!  He&#39;s our guy for spearheading some amazing new look into UFO&#39;s all of a sudden?</p>

<p>No fucking way this is not a setup.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course there&#39;s no video footage from the casino, as others have stated, it&#39;s obvious why those haven&#39;t been released.</p>

<p>The real question is why are the authorities not releasing the 911 tapes?</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/crime/shootings/search-warrant-records-offer-insight-into-las-vegas-shooting-investigation/">https://www.reviewjournal.com/crime/shootings/search-warrant-records-offer-insight-into-las-vegas-shooting-investigation/</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/crime/shootings/review-journal-goes-to-court-to-obtain-las-vegas-shooting-records/">https://www.reviewjournal.com/crime/shootings/review-journal-goes-to-court-to-obtain-las-vegas-shooting-records/</a></p>

<p>Quoting that second article, &quot;The Review-Journal submitted a petition Friday in Clark County District Court seeking 911 recordings and logs of the emergency calls the night of the shooting. More than a month after the newspaper asked for the public records, Las Vegas police have declined to turn them over, the petition says.</p>

<p>“The Review-Journal requested documents on Oct. 2 and we have received little to no response,” Keith Moyer, Review-Journal editor-in-chief, said Friday. “Other media outlets across the United States have encountered the same outcome and share the Review-Journal’s concern about what amounts to an information shutdown — thus these actions, in an effort to help the public understand more about this historically horrible event.”</p>

<p>I already made a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7jbmcn/complete_this_sentence_or_meet_your_doom_the/">thread</a> asking for visual (photo or video) evidence of shots actually being fired on the scene, including bullet damage, gunshot wounds, or medical activity. The only thing that even came close was a photo I call &quot;girl with blood on leg.&quot;</p>

<p>No shots were fired in Vegas. I love saying this and getting downvoted because it shows that instead of evidence, there is only impotent rage and frantic shilling. </p>

Not like releasing CCTV would even stop these stupid ideas from proliferating. They&#39;d just claim something stupid like it was made on a stage by the secret government that controls all. </p>
