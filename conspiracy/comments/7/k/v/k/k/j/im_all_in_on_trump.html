We can make a difference but the world&#39;s too big to make an educated guess on what&#39;s coming next. You guys know that more anyone. </p>

<p>If you would have told me in 2014 that Donald Trump would be the next president I would have died laughing. </p>

<p>Yet here I am, watching him change the world single handedly every day. </p>

<p>Either this is a true revolution, a clandestine, shadow counter coup that we all contributed to. Or it is the <em>single largest psyop ever conducted</em> </p>

<p>Either way, it&#39;s an opportunity for us as committed individuals to get more involved. </p>

<p>So, let&#39;s do it!!! </p>

<p>If someone criticizes you for valuing what Trump has done, use it as an opportunity to educate them on <em>why</em> we support this ancient Frog god reincarnated. </p>

<p>He represents the fall of the control system. </p>

<p>I mean seriously, it&#39;s hilarious. Either the control system has made the biggest error in its history, or this orange faced bafoon has become our greatest hope. </p>

<p>I&#39;m all in!!!!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>These are facts and I value that. If you look a bit back the discussion was about Trump being the cause for the good economy and low unemployment. My argument was actually that this started BEFORE Trump, exactly as your graph shows. You can argue about the word &quot;boom&quot; but I used the words of the guy I was responding too and this wasn&#39;t the issue at all. Still: the company I work for cranks out more products than ever and has great trouble finding employees. So are most companies in this area. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wat. You know what Nov. 8th was, right? How can you claim that two years of absolute stagnation suddenly ending and rocketing up is not because of the election? The economy was in a downward turn up until the election night. This boom was 100% caused by the election of Trump, and has continued throughout his presidency. Claiming otherwise is willful ignorance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I already did that, that was the entire point of the first picture. For your viewing pleasure I also added a rough line of best fit for the last two years of stagnation <a href="https://imgur.com/a/mHLiX">here</a>. The black line shows the stagnation, the red line shows Nov 8th AKA The election of Trump.    </p>

<p>Furthermore, the economy of the EU historically mirrors that of the U.S, slightly delayed. <a href="https://imgur.com/a/mHLiX">Source</a>.

    <div class="md"><p>The economy numbers look like a rich cash grab before the next recession and it has for a while now when even Obama was getting the record highs everyday. So now that the stock market is doing bigly because of the election and corps going to 20% from 35% taxes, do you think we&#39;ll see a significant rise in income for all? Or will the corps just keep wages where they are at 8 bucks an hour for minimum and just pocket the cash?</p>

<p>If something like 2007 happens again it could go all the way back down to it&#39;s lowest point or even lower. That&#39;s going to affect us and not the billionaire president or the other CEOs. Obama said multiple times their strategy was slow and steady to get it moving in the right direction. </p>

<p>So bragging about flying close to the sun may work out, Icarus. I&#39;m just preparing for the next recession because it could be worse when we got 15% less taxes from the megacorporations to help people with. That&#39;s schools, firefighters, police, money for roads all getting cut because they do not get enough money to pay people a salary. </p>

<p>Hispanic unemployment is at an all-time low and black unemployment is at a 17 year low</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Those are correct statements. But it&#39;s still only relatively modest decline in unemployment. In Sept 2016, unemployment was around 8% for Black Americans. It dropped to 7.7% by August and had huge drop in September 2017 to 7.0%. A 17 year low, yes. But only a 1% decrease.  And if we take into account jobs lost due to the hurricanes (august - sept 2017), the decrease is on .4%, </p>

<p>Hispanic workers fared a little better. Dropping from 6.4% in sept. 2016 to 5.1% in sept. 2017. This is still a relatively modest 1.3%. </p>

<p>The numbers at the above link were derived directly from the Bureau Of Labor Statistics monthly jobs reports. </p>

<p>Terms like all-time low and 17 year low are technically correct. But they also give the impression that there were truly significant decreases in unemployment for those groups. Which the numbers do not bear out. </p>

<p>As a side note, overall unemployment hasn&#39;t changed much. 4.6% in November 2016 vs. 4.1% in November 2017. </p>

<p>If you graduate high school, get a job (any job) and don&#39;t have a kid out of wedlock, you will most likely end up in the middle class (U.S).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is laughably incorrect. There was a time when someone with a high school diploma could aspire to being middle class. One income was enough to buy a house, have a car and support a family. Those days are long gone. Someone coming out of high school without at least a trade isn&#39;t going to make the kind of money someone needs to be what could be called middle class. And forget about buying a house or supporting a family. </p>

<p>Being in the top 1% in the world is a bizarre and irrelevant statistic. It is cold comfort to know you have it better than say a poor person in Somalia when you don&#39;t have enough to eat. </p>

<p>And one last point.  Whether someone has a kid in our out of marriage doesn&#39;t matter in terms of finances. Having children does, of course. But married or no doesn&#39;t. </p>

<p>Under Trump, the strangling regulations are being lifted and we&#39;re getting a tax policy for business that makes us competitive.  That&#39;s how you grow an economy and that&#39;s why the stock market is up 5000 points this year.</p>

About national identity: I do love my country and I don&#39;t think I will ever move far from it. But I am not a &quot;right or wrong, my country&quot; kind of person. My parents lived through WWII and like many Europeans I get a bit nervous about excessive flag waving as it reminds them of the dangers of nationalism. I also traveled a lot and people all over the world have much more in common than they differ. 
About sovereignty: I see Europe as a way for small countries to survive among large forces like the US, Russia and China and actually still keep a fair amount of sovereignty. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think Muslims are &quot;invading&quot;? I actually work with several Muslims, non Muslim refugees and migrants, no problems at all. We have people from Ukraine, Russia itself, Turkey, Morocco, Italy, Slovakia, Indonesia, Bangladesh, you name it. Both Muslims and refugees/migrants from other countries work hard, respect each other and cause no problems. 
The only one that is actually causing grave problems is a national. The largest danger is Western converts to Islam as they do often tend to radicalism.
Still I do think that a thorough screening is in place and that there should be a limited number per year. 
Compare it to the Jewish issue just before and during WWII. Is it the right thing to do just to let people rot out of fear that there might be a few assholes among them? Isn&#39;t the US build on refugees and migrants? </p>

The men who want to be remembered as great often attemp to write that narrative themselves and end up being remembered for nothing they want to be remembered for in history. Trump speaks too highly of himself and his actions to ever be a great man, to do that one would need to be humble at times and when faced with fear demonstrate both great strength and restraint. All trump can do is talk about what he has &quot;accomplished&quot; in his first 11 months in office (something no one else is really able to answer) and when faced with a difficult situation he restores to childish behavior such as his approach with the North Korean leader Kim </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t say he is a moron. Not even ol&#39; Dubya was one. As I said, in my view all this hate is engineered; they don&#39;t really hate him, they&#39;re playing a part and he&#39;s playing his. These are the rules of the game. Think about it, man, they&#39;re all on the same friggin&#39; side! They&#39;re giving us the illusion of choice and as i said earlier, partisal politics are a convenient distraction at best and a powerful weapon of class warfare at worst.</p>

<p>In my view all this hate is engineered; they don&#39;t really hate him, MSM playing a part and he&#39;s playing his.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is essentially a battle between the owners of MSM outlets and Trump. They&#39;re using their minions, Trump uses Twitter. Trump is the greatest manipulator of media the world has ever seen. He has vision, high optics. Sees past the sale. He&#39;s an expert salesman. I work in sales, and nearly everything he does his high level, high volume sales. I see it a mile away, and this isn&#39;t some snake oil salesman shit, either. </p>

<p>They are playing their part and want to control and infect the populace. Trump is calling their bluff. Even if he says lies or half-truths, Trump always has a way out(part of a sales technique) he&#39;ll make it a win because the media is so distrusted. </p>

<p>Trump has a type-A personality. I think we can agree Trump is an alpha-male, too. He also has strong leadership skills. He has been in a power position his entire life where he&#39;s the boss, he calls the shots. Trump built himself a huge empire worth billions, and given a 0% chance to win. Why would a person who could spend the rest of their days living the lavish life they always had to have your name ran through the mud, risk everything you&#39;ve built, risk your life, your families lives just for a job that is very high stress and low paying? </p>

<p>Trump is a dog they cannot put a leash on. That&#39;s the problem.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also, this is YOUR (our) money he&#39;s lining his friends&#39; pockets with.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m curious how you think this is true? What examples show Trump is lining his friends&#39; pockets? </p>

<p>I am not religious person, I am more in tune with my spirit so excuse my interpretation but having read the Bible in college I know that the anti Christ was often referred to as many things one being that, &quot;beware the great manipulator&quot; </p>

<p>Come on people stop only getting your information from Reddit and expand your mind. I watch CNN and Fox News and the NYT and huff post and also Reddit. The problem we have in this day and with the current culture, is that everyone is willing be an expert on any given subject, but no one wants to actually know anything. Your egos are over inflated and you have boxed yourself into a corner where you can never not support trump because if you did you&#39;d have to be wrong, I&#39;m tired of having to shake people out of themselves for them to realize that HELLO the world is not in a good place and no matter how hard you tell your self it is, it will never be so and the cycle will never break. Honestly for a bunch on conspiracy theorist I would have thought u may be more open minded </p>

<blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m not religious, and don&#39;t read the bible.</p>

<p>One thing that did stick out to me that you said was: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>to realize that HELLO the world is not in a good place and no matter how hard you tell your self it is, it will never be so and the cycle will never break.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Be the change you wish to see in the world. You can truly create the world you want. If you dream it, you can achieve it if you put your mind to it. It might sound cliche but it&#39;s true.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Honestly for a bunch on conspiracy theorist I would have thought u may be more open minded</p>
</blockquote>

<p>More open minded about what? Depends on the subject, no? Somethings you <em>know</em> and other things you don&#39;t know jack shit. If you take a stance on something, and are presented with new information that contradicts/disproves your stance, and you don&#39;t change, you may have an ego problem. Personally I like to be proven wrong. It helps us grow as individuals. A whole lot of people on this site have an ego problem though.</p>

<p>Seeing the establishment shove the Clinton/Bush dynasties down our throats in the beginning seemed predictable. Then Mr. Orange man (with the help of a lot of free advertising) takes down both dynasties. He would have lost to the Bern man, but I digress (err, I mean &quot;voting is a sham!&quot;) If Trump is a reverse psychology of the hidden hand then I would be surprised, as that hasn&#39;t seemed to be their M.O. If Putin conspired with him to take down the two dynasties, why would the most openly pro Israel candidate be chosen,amplifying the U.S., Israeli relationship that stands in opposition to much of the world? to foment WW3?  </p>

<p>If Trump and Putin colluded, will they now somehow broker world peace to make themselves the saviors of humanity? Maybe they have their own Blue beam to unfurl.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump&#39;s policies: name one actual policy he&#39;s promoted (and not just mentioned on the campaign trail) that a typical neocon wouldn&#39;t support. I&#39;ll then point you to a collection of elected Republicans (i.e., Congress) who all support it. He&#39;s a neocon. This is not even a remotely controversial opinion. </p>

<p>Trump&#39;s supporters: they either like that he&#39;s a neocon, or they don&#39;t understand that he&#39;s a neocon (aka they&#39;re idiots). </p>

<p>You: &quot;He represents the fall of the control system.&quot; LOL! Let&#39;s start with an obvious premise: the greatest source of power in this world is money. Agree? (Or do you say military? Find me a legit powerful military without money.) Trump is hellbent on furthering the consolidation of that money (that power) in the hands of the same small group that already holds that money (power). Without question, his administration is doing everything they can to promote the interests of capital (i.e., the individuals and corporations that hold that vast majority of all wealth). Yet, DELUSIONAL IDIOTS think that he&#39;s somehow a revolutionary counter to existing power. Why? Because he&#39;s anti federal regulation? What a massive departure from other Republicans in power! /s</p>

<p>Dude, face it, he&#39;s not a revolutionary. You support a Republican toolbag. (IDGAF about your unrelated opinion about Democrats, who are also toolbags for the most part.)</p>

<p>Interesting.</p>

<p>One would think it would either be heavily downvoted or upvoted, depending if it&#39;s work hours in Russia or ShariaBlue.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think Muslims are &quot;invading&quot;? I actually work with several Muslims, non Muslim refugees and migrants, no problems at all. We have people from Ukraine, Russia itself, Turkey, Morocco, Italy, Slovakia, Indonesia, Bangladesh, you name it. Both Muslims and refugees/migrants from other countries work hard, respect each other and cause no problems. 
The only one that is actually causing grave problems is a national. The largest danger is Western converts to Islam as they do often tend to radicalism.
Still I do think that a thorough screening is in place and that there should be a limited number per year. 
Compare it to the Jewish issue just before and during WWII. Is it the right thing to do just to let people rot out of fear that there might be a few assholes among them? Isn&#39;t the US build on refugees and migrants? </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>In my view all this hate is engineered; they don&#39;t really hate him, MSM playing a part and he&#39;s playing his.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is essentially a battle between the owners of MSM outlets and Trump. They&#39;re using their minions, Trump uses Twitter. Trump is the greatest manipulator of media the world has ever seen. He has vision, high optics. Sees past the sale. He&#39;s an expert salesman. I work in sales, and nearly everything he does his high level, high volume sales. I see it a mile away, and this isn&#39;t some snake oil salesman shit, either. </p>

<p>They are playing their part and want to control and infect the populace. Trump is calling their bluff. Even if he says lies or half-truths, Trump always has a way out(part of a sales technique) he&#39;ll make it a win because the media is so distrusted. </p>

<p>Trump has a type-A personality. I think we can agree Trump is an alpha-male, too. He also has strong leadership skills. He has been in a power position his entire life where he&#39;s the boss, he calls the shots. Trump built himself a huge empire worth billions, and given a 0% chance to win. Why would a person who could spend the rest of their days living the lavish life they always had to have your name ran through the mud, risk everything you&#39;ve built, risk your life, your families lives just for a job that is very high stress and low paying? </p>

<p>Trump is a dog they cannot put a leash on. That&#39;s the problem.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also, this is YOUR (our) money he&#39;s lining his friends&#39; pockets with.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m curious how you think this is true? What examples show Trump is lining his friends&#39; pockets? </p>
