<p>No, they are far older, and have dealt with true tyranny (Socialism is another form of tyranny)... Then again, Communism makes people dead inside, and not care. We should institute Communism!!!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And I assume while you were there on business you explored the city and went into the bad areas that even locals avoid, much less tourists. You could go spend a week in Detroit and as long as you stayed in the area of your downtown hotel and the convention center/wherever you&#39;re doing business you&#39;d think it was great. Every city has nice areas no matter how bad the worst areas are.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t get how people are always denying the refugees in Europe aren&#39;t a problem; I saw a video of a woman in Paris walking down a street with all the Muslims staring and acting hostile, then she went into a cafe and was told to leave, she wasn&#39;t welcome without a male escort. That might be OK in Saudi Arabia, not in Paris. I saw a video of a couple white guys going into a &quot;no go zone&quot; in London and they got attacked simply for being present and white. But then people on here flat out deny that those things happened.</p>

These assholes do shit like go into musim neighborhoods and call them names, drive on the wrong side of the road, throw things at them etc, THEN they turn the cameras on and play the victim.  And stupid people fall for not every time.  Ask yourself if a video is painting someone as too cartoonishly evil and stereotypical, of they are, it was almost certainly faked.  Also, consider the sources of these videos.  These people have an agenda just like the liberals, just like the zionists, and just like the kkk.

<p>The last time our government proposed a law that people didn&#39;t approved, thousands people went on the streets during an entire year, unions blocked our oil refineries depriving the whole country of oil, they reduced the activity of our nuclear power plants. I&#39;ve never seen such riots in the US, even against Trump, the riots last some weeks, with some placards.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And this is why these nations in Western Europe are ultimately doomed. America has lots of problems but we aren’t an entitlement or nanny state yet. Once unions and government get their hooks in every aspect of life, you are slaves to government. They provide you the service and you vote to make sure said service is never cut or limited. Those same people are letting in an unending immigrant wave that will see Europe disappear as we know it within 100 years. These people will break your social welfare systems. </p>

<p>If this was the case in America, we would be an uncompetitive basket case. People already vote purely on handouts from the government and the continuation of the welfare state. If America had universal healthcare, it would be the only political issue. You could never limit government ever again or else ‘you are sentencing people to death!’. We would cease to be a superpower and the Puritan working spirit of the county would be gone forever. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>True, but the monarchy was ruling since like 500, and the country was populated and more concentrated. Native American tribes tended to keep to themselves. There&#39;s ancient history in Europe, while the US really has no ancient ruins. I just meant France has actually been a country since before the US and Great Britain. French monarchy was also older than the monarchy of Great Britain where the US founders came from. I think the history of both should be considered when you compare the reasons that caused the 2 revolutions and the events that boiled over to cause both. </p>

<p>But the Government is older definitely, but the foundings are very far in age. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In Australia I believe we have psychological and physical freedom whilst America just has physical freedom. Sure, in Australia, you can&#39;t own a gun (which many will argue is good as that limits the streets criminals from owning guns too, which it does, majority of their crimes are committed with knives). But in Australia, you also don&#39;t have to worry about going bankrupt because you got sick or going to jail for carrying weed. So America has physical freedom but they are still slaves in the mind. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Australians are enslaved mentally by all kinds of things, just like Americans, Europeans, pretty much everyone. In China they are REALLY slaves in the mind. I see what you mean, in Australia I think people are free of <em>paranoia</em> or <em>fear of being unsafe</em> but there are downsides to that as well. People have a tendency of becoming docile, weak, or lazy or even scared of nothing when they are that safe</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As an Australian myself what I&#39;ve noticed is a kind of &quot;comfortably numb.&quot;  There&#39;s an undercurrent of discontentment but not quite enough of it vs drive/energy to do anything about it.  People are generally quite docile and while they&#39;ll talk until the cows come home about certain issues, other ones are completely taboo and peer/social pressured off the discussion block.    </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe that fluoride has a big part to do with making people docile.  The new legislation to make vaccines mandatory for kindergarten and primary school in Victoria is just going to make things worse and that&#39;s going to expand to high school, university and as many occupations as they can get into.</p>

<p>All this propaganda about &quot;herd mentality.&quot;  Most of us born before the 90s only had a few of the vaccines that are available now and the ones we had would have worn off.  So theoretically (probably more like literally) none of us have any &quot;immunity.&quot;  </p>

<p>So for pre-90s people there is no &quot;herd immunity&quot; and yet I don&#39;t see any epidemic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are 2 reasons for this imo.  1.  America is much more divided country.  And the government and corporations play to this division.</p>

<ol>
<li>Amerians live too spread out.  While Europeans live mostly in densely populated cities.  Americans live so far out in the suburbs, and commute in cars.  So it becomes much harder to organize with each other.  If you look at NYC, they have thriving unions that don&#39;t put up with shit.</li>

    <div class="md"><p>The French? Tough? What?</p>

<p>There are many ways to describe the French but I don’t think tough is one of them. They are letting their country get overrun with migrants in the name of diversity. The implications of this are going to be very extreme if they don’t wake up and do something soon. I am all for helping people but it’s clear the intentions behind this massive migration wave isn’t for diversity, it’s for destabilization of the current society model. </p>

<p>Not to mention the French have extremely high tax rates. Didn’t they have problems with people leaving their country because they didn’t want to pay the taxes?</p>

<p>This whole post reeks of shill</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Those are ethnically white homogeneous states. We are a divided people, it is harder to agree and get stuff done, constantly comparing the US to Denmark or similar countries is disingenuous. Plus reddit is always saying we should be even more diverse country like India or Africa. You either get homogeneous where we all look alike and understand and trust each other, or you get America where a 13% minority commits more than 50% of homocides. Diversified America is already easy to control since 1960 they have been shilling it hard and you ppl ate it up.</p>
