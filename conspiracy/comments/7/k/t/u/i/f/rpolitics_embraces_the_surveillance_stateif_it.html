<p>You&#39;re giving them too much credit...they are largely outraged because of &quot;Russia&quot; etc.</p>

<p>The surveillance state has been encroaching rather dramatically for the last 25 years...and the fact that they appear up in arms only now is as misguided as it is suspicious.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that when we analyze things, we look for our own bias in them and this case is no different. </p>

<p>Why wouldn’t they be outraged because of Russia? Or Cambridge? Seems to be well within their rights, considering CA has helped elect Trump and push Brexit and they stand to benefit. Russia also stands to benefit from both things happening.</p>

<p>Are all people on r conspiracy crazy? No. Do people say they are and generalize the entire sub? Yes. Does that bother you? I would imagine so. Now, on the other hand, you’re putting all these politricks in the same basket saying that they are just now up in arms about surveillance, but some, if not most have probably been against it. </p>

<p>I&#39;m only going off of what I&#39;ve observed in the last year or so on that sub.</p>

<p>It&#39;s consistently manufactured and misguided outrage...the hivemind mentality that reigns supreme there simply cannot be denied at this point.</p>

<p>Of course not <em>everyone</em> has succumbed to the group think, but for all intents and purposes, it&#39;s nearly impossible to express <em>anything</em> that goes against the grain in that sub and have your voice heard.</p>

<p>Yes, if you believe that the left is ruining the world through cultural Marxism. </p>

<p>You really, as a contributor to a conspiracy sub, haven’t read anything about this at all? Nothing? It’s the right wing sharia blue. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Well, judging from the Flynn indictment, it seemed like any sanctions would be ignored (which, afaik, they are being ignored), which would benefit them. Plus, destabilizing the two most powerful alleged democracies creates a channel where Russia can make a power grab, a money grab or both. </p>

<p>Again, do you think conspiracy is immune to this kind of thinking, because it isn’t. At all. Left/right paradigm aside, this place has several different hive minds going at once. Depends on the day, really. </p>

<p>For lying about legal contacts with non-hostile state actors.  </p>

<p>Everyone has &quot;major ties&quot; to &quot;shady&quot; Russia.  Just look at the Podesta Group.</p>

<p>Russia isn&#39;t &quot;shady&quot; though.  That&#39;s just your standard leftist xenophobia talking.</p>

That&#39;s what I have noticed on that sub is things are only bad when Trump does it.  Doesn&#39;t matter when democrats do the same thing it&#39;s just trumpets doing whataboutism trying to distract.  I just hope these people realize that the Trump team wasn&#39;t the only entity doing all this data farming on people and they should also be outraged at the non-Trump entities farming their data to profile.</p>
