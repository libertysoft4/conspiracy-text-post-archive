    <div class="md"><p>I keep seeing that assumption as well. Personally, it would change mine, as although I am a Christian, I don’t believe we’re privy to all knowledge and there could exist other life forms outside of our planet, within the realm of God. </p>

<p>I think for it to change your faith you would have to be certain that there are no unknowns for you, and for an unknown to shake your faith, that faith must have been pretty fragile to begin with. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right. It may be challenging to literal young earth creationists. But that would not impact old earth creationists or theistic evolutionists, would it?

    <div class="md"><p>You’re assuming that to have faith one must believe in a literal interpretation of the Bible and that is the comprehensive, infallible word of God. Personally, I’m a Christian believe but I don’t believe any man who ever wrote about God got it completely right.

    <div class="md"><p>It really just comes down to me not letting anyone else dictate what I do or don’t believe. There’s no denomination that I’m aware of that doesn’t require literal interpretation of the Word but I don’t get my personal beliefs from church. I was raised to believe in a literal interpretation of the Bible but as an adult I moved into agnosticism and very close to atheism. I’ve migrated back to Christianity over the last few years but I still believe a personal relationship with Jesus is more important than whether or not you believe the Bible is infallible. These are just my personal beliefs. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Genesis 1, verse 1, line 1: 
In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.</p>

<p>And it goes on there about making light (after earth!) and all sorts of other things, but not other planets let alone other beings on them.</p>

<p>Would they have their own bible then? If so, the bible couldn&#39;t be the one and only word of god.</p>

<p>If not, why are they not mentioned? The bible sure goes to length on the lineage of a few people, and many other relatively inane things, but failed to mention aliens?</p>

<p>I find that notion hard to justify from a literalist perspective. I also find the bible hard to justify as a whole from a non-literalist viewpoint as a serious &quot;inspired by god&quot; document. In my (less informed) view, it has too much repetition, irrelevant info, and info that.... well for lack of better words just can&#39;t be taken to mean much. But that isn&#39;t what this is about really. My religious background was pretty strictly bible literalism.... So I don&#39;t carry as good an understanding of a non literal interpretation of the bible.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t say OP was speaking for how I think, nor did the thought cross my mind. My answer to his question was, &quot;Nope.&quot; I really don&#39;t feel obligated to explain myself to you, and I think you may be getting sucked into a negative reaction. However, I feel like discussion is healthy; so here we go:</p>

<p>The context of this post comes from excuse - making as to why disclosure has been restricted. Said excuses are trying to speak for how I think. These excuses have caused the OP to question said excuses; us people here at conspiracy enjoy that. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t want people to speak for the way anyone thinks as an excuse to restrict truth. When I hear, &quot;People seem to think the revelation of extraterrestrial life would be a deal-breaker for Christianity.&quot; I know that some theosophical leaders have said this before. The same goes for other&#39;s who behave dogmatically like scientists or anchorwomen // anchormen on lying news outlets for example.</p>

<p>Hope that helps. Hope you&#39;ve calmed down. I also down-voted your negative reaction. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>For Christianity, that is kind of already explained. Most theologians believe that our Scriptures are written to guide people in a local context. In Christianity, we have the idea of progressive revelation, which is the idea that truth is revealed more fully as time goes on. </p>

<p>So it wasn&#39;t addressed in Scripture because it wasn&#39;t relevant to the recipients of those writings.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hmmm. I guess that makes sense, although I do recall Genesis talking about how God created stars and space and such. If there was any chance another lifeforms could visit the earth it would seem relevant in a local context. </p>

<p>I am one who believes in the bible as truth, in a metaphorical context. So I don&#39;t require that to be in there. I just know that modern day Christians tend to take it very literally, so that&#39;s why it doesn&#39;t seem to make sense why aliens wouldn&#39;t be mentioned. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The fatal flaw is that they are all fraudulent, ripped off from sun God worship since before Egyptian times. </p>

<p>That doesn&#39;t however preclude that a God doesn&#39;t exist. Simply that organized religion does not serve to guide people but control them. </p>

<p>If this wasn&#39;t true, the word of Jesus wouldn&#39;t have turned into Christianity, since he preached of the God within, not a God you worship. A God that you can be one with, a God that you can communicate with. Yet somehow they believe repentance alone can save their soul, as if a God that demanded Abraham kill his own son to test his loyalty would then suddenly allow all people to simply repent their sins, and they are good regardless of their loyalty shown through living by his word.</p>

<p>If aliens come organized religion is doomed, and the truth of the word of God will be the hammer of its destruction. There is no God above, only the God within. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m very new to reading the Bible and additional books that support/enhance the Bible. </p>

<p>It seems many do not want to face the concept that 200 fallen angels came to earth and started breeding with the women. Giants? It&#39;s in the Bible. Nephilim? Also in the Bible. </p>

<p>So also in time, they began to seed with other creatures...hence our so called Aliens. They were practicing DNA alteration? Performing abortions. Metal work? G_D and Enoch had more than one meeting to discuss this abomination...Enoch was and then was not. So, the first guy that is <em>transported</em> but oddly he didn&#39;t ascend! Did G_D place him over Antarctica? </p>

<p>To hear some thinkers discuss the continued presence of these fallen creatures one might speculate that  A.) the seed survived the flood B.) reemerged from the Ark thru Noah&#39;s family C.) are more powerful and cunning than the first Seed.</p>

<p>The Books of Enoch and Jasher really give more insight than traditional Christians seem comfortable discussing. In Jasher it explains the Staffs turning into serpents - kinda trippy? But also the Staff that Moses holds up at the parting waters...that is explained in Jasher as a Sword in the Stone kinda discovery for Moses! Who knew...well I didn&#39;t.</p>

<p>Enoch explains the Stars in their purpose, they have assigned places, duties and times...almost as if they can be mischief makers? What if the Orbs that have been filmed are Stars? Some have filmed these little orbs around eclipse events...what if they are there to perform specific duties? Orbs that have been filmed making patterns in fields? How about the Nazca formations?</p>

<p>Once I started thinking about Jericho (from an Agnostic perspective...) because really, the OT reads like a perpetual blood bath by a very angry G_D and is a huge point of contention for Atheists and Agnostics - if one considers the inhabitants thru the eyes of Jasher that place was rocking some vile creatures. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe in the God of the universe, not just the world.  I think you have asked a very intelligent question and I think Christians need to examine their own faith to see how strong it is.  I am not worried about aliens and am not afraid of them.  My faith is in Jesus, the Word of God.  The Bible says there will be signs and wonders in the heavens.  It says Satan can appear as an angel of light.  It also says that if an angel appears with a different gospel other than Jesus to beware.  We live in exciting times and it will be interesting to see what transpires.  Thank you for asking an interesting question.  I think Christians themselves need to ask this of themselves and be strong in their faith...the Bible says many shall fall away.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My perception is the biblical god is &quot;supposed&quot;  to be the god of all, not just earth, or tge solar system which is suggestive of whoever wrote it not being aware there was much other than the earth, sun, moon, maaaaybe a few planets and a lot of stars</p>
