<p><a href="https://www.politico.com/interactives/2017/obama-hezbollah-drug-trafficking-investigation/">https://www.politico.com/interactives/2017/obama-hezbollah-drug-trafficking-investigation/</a></p>

<p>The killing of the project might have single handedly created the opioid pandemic we are experiencing right now. </p>

<p>Second, the security risk for not only the nations in the middle east but US directly as the result of Project Cassandra being dismantled is irreversible. We will be paying for this for years to come. </p>

<p>Finally, the failure of the deal at the end, where we have allowed drug money and terrorists to run free in return for virtually nothing on top of billions of dollars spent is enraging. The only question remains at the end whos pockets in the US got filled with dollar bills covered in blood and cocaine.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This was a very well sourced article. I wonder how much tax payer money was wasted to fund this project? I wonder how many terrorist attacks could have been thwarted, how many lives could have been saved had the task force been allowed to do their job? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Tax payers money was well invested until the Obama administration decided to dismantle the project... then it all went down the shitter. If DEA got the green light to work on all of the intel I can imagine the benefits of it would have been well worth it. </p>

<p>Allowing terorflights to continue for so many years, shipping drugs one way and arms the other is the real deal here. Who cut the check to whom and who benefited the most, within US from this deal going on for so long is the real question?</p>

<p>If there is a way to follow the money, and prove who benefited directly from the deal in the US, should be trialed to the fullest. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great article.</p>

<p>It is fucking mind boggling that they let Ali Fayad go.  Imagine if Trump let a Puntin connected arms trafficker escape extradition.    The fucking guy was arrested while trying to sell Russian anti-aircraft missiles to terrorsts to shoot down American helicopters for fucks sake.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bill let Osama go for yet unknown reasons. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t understand the logic behind the thinking such as &quot;oh, lets get this guy we know is really really bad get away for some greater benefit we might see down the road...&quot;</p>

<p>has that ever worked ? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree it is a well &quot;sourced&quot; article... a great example of how to write a complex narrative to drum up support for another war that nobody wants.  Is 2018 going to be the year of the Hezbollah/Iranian sponsored &quot;terrorist attacks&quot;? </p>

<p>&quot;...Hezbollah mostly left the United States alone, in what was clearly a strategic decision to avoid U.S. retaliation. But by 2008, the Bush administration came to believe that Islamic Jihad was the most dangerous terrorist organization in the world, capable of launching instantaneous attacks, possibly with chemical, biological or low-grade nuclear weapons, that would dwarf those on 9/11.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The Bush administration had made disrupting the networks through which Iran obtained parts for its weapons of mass destruction programs a top priority&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hezbollah “has at its disposal one of the most capable networks of actors coalescing elements of transnational organized crime with terrorism in the world,” the assessment concluded.</p>

<p>Some top U.S. military officials shared those concerns, including the four-star generals heading U.S. Special Operations and Southern commands, who warned Congress that Hezbollah’s criminal operations and growing beachhead in Latin America posed an urgent threat to U.S. security, according to transcripts of the hearings.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And Hezbollah continues to scout potential U.S. targets for attack if it decides Washington has crossed some red line against it or Iran. &quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree, the implications of handling project Cassandra the way Obama administration did is far reaching. What is the point of having DEA if their hands are tied or even worse like in this case the entire task force dismember despite the evidence?</p>
