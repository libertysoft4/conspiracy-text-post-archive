<blockquote>
<p>In combination with Palfrey&#39;s statement that she had 10,000 to 15,000 phone numbers of clients, this caused several clients&#39; lawyers to contact Palfrey to see whether accommodations could be made to keep their identities private.</p>

<p>Ultimately, ABC News, after going through what was described as &quot;46 lb&quot; [21 kg] of phone records, decided that none of the potential clients was sufficiently &quot;newsworthy&quot; to bother mentioning.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Possible translation: ABC found some of their top execs on her list and decided it wasn&#39;t &quot;newsworthy.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sibley, Palfrey&#39;s former attorney, claims to have her phone records and that they are relevant to the 2016 presidential election.</p>

<p>In April 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court denied the request to lift a lower court order, in place since 2007, that bars Sibley from releasing any information about her records.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why it&#39;s suspicious:</p>
</blockquote>

<ol>
<li><p>her body was found at a shed near her mother&#39;s home;</p></li>
<li><p>police readily say it was a suicide without a thorough investigation;</p></li>
<li><p>her last public comments were defiant, and she threatened to reveal her client list or to sell it to the highest bidder.</p></li>
<li><p>she&#39;s been arrested before (In 1992, she pleaded guilty to attempted felony pimping...she spent 18 months in a state prison) and knew how to weather this new arrest;</p></li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
<p>From the Washington Post:</p>

<p>&quot;I am not a quitter,&quot; Palfrey wrote in another e-mail to The Post. &quot;Additionally, I abhor injustice, on any level and in any forum. I frankly persist despite life&#39;s barriers. It is no more complicated than this.&quot;</p>

<p>We already knew Trump had connections to underage prostitution rings in the past from his good friend Tevfik Arif.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>how is this historical gem being used today? As a high-end bordello, staffed with beautiful models who also serve as prostitutes, working at the beck and call of Tevfik Arif. A wealthy Russian-American businessman, he is a real-estate developer who has partnered with Donald Trump on several projects including the Trump Soho and the Trump International Hotel and Tower in Fort Lauderdale. Arif was rounded up along with about ten others this week in a raid on the yacht.</p>

<p>Meaning, they consented. So what&#39;s the problem there? If I want to touch a bag, and the women let&#39;s me touch her vag, it&#39;s A-ok. Otherwise vages would never get touched and humanity would disappear.</p>

<p>He is on tape trying to seduce a married woman, which is sleazy. That&#39;s about it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you&#39;re saying it&#39;s ok to shove your tongue down some random stranger on the street&#39;s mouth in the hopes that they&#39;re in to it? And uh bud. Actually. If you listen to the tape he says right in it that he tried and failed. If you think trump is batting 1000 with his straight to the pussy technique (which is sexual assault on its own), Ive got a great deal on a bridge you may be interested in</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol. Nah man. Dude was defending Trump&#39;s claims of shoving his tongue down someone&#39;s throat/grabbing a woman in a sexual way who he just met because of his comment of &quot;they let you&quot;, I simply took what he said to it&#39;s logical conclusion, that the statement implies it&#39;s not assault as long as they want it, and therefore every woman trump ever did that to would have to want it for him not to have committed sexual assault. Besides, I simply asked if that&#39;s what he was contending. He didn&#39;t reply, because what he said was disgusting on the surface and there&#39;s no defending that statement. Read up your fallacies bud. There&#39;s nothing fallacious about asking someone about the clear as day implications of their statement</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The statement doesn&#39;t imply that it&#39;s not assault if the woman wanted it- it&#39;s actually isn&#39;t assault if the woman wanted it. </p>

<p>I didn&#39;t reply because I said something disgusting? Um no, here I am. </p>

<p>As for the details of the married woman he hit on, I don&#39;t know, I can&#39;t speak on that, I just know she was married and he hit on her anyway, which I said was sleazy. </p>

<p>Either way you slice it, sexual contact that&#39;s wanted, because he&#39;s rich it a celebrity or whatever, isnt assault. He clearly picked up on enough signals to think it was welcome, and his results seem to confirm, as he was never arrested for sexual assault. Your argument hinges on a woman eventually not wanting it. I havent heard from this hypothetical woman yet. I&#39;ll take Trump&#39;s word over yours. </p>

<p>Have you ever kissed a girl without asking first? Do you characterise that as assualt? Take that back. Have you ever kissed a girl?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>you are just digging yourself deeper and deeper. you are attempting to conflate just having met someone in a professional setting, cornering them, grabbing them, and shoving your tongue down their throat, with the idea of having to literally ask the words &quot;can i kiss you?&quot; to someone who you are on a date with or some shit. that is the most disingenuous attempt at bullshit i have ever read. absolutely pathetic and par for the course of this conversation.</p>

<p>yeah, keep going on about how you &quot;can&#39;t speak to&quot; something he literally said in that video. the answer is yes. walking up to someone you had just met, in a professional setting, cornering, and shoving your tongue down someone&#39;s throat... is sexual assault. not &quot;hitting on someone&quot;. their fucking marital status doesn&#39;t matter the slightest bit. it was not wanted, and the sexual contact still happened. i&#39;m sorry you find that hard to understand, but it speaks to the character you&#39;ve displayed in your posts here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, was it wanted or not? If so, wasn&#39;t assault. You keep laying on unessesary details and settings and &quot;cornering&quot; and all this extra bullshit to make your argument fly. </p>

<p>Yeah you&#39;ve conceded the argument when instead of making your point, you waste your own time  trolling someone&#39;s post history or even worse, subreddits, to find something to hang on them. It proves you got nothing in the argument at hand.</p>

I said multiple times through this conversation it was NOT WANTED. my argument has been pretty clear the whole time. one little quip as an edit isnt the end of the world dont let it get to ya ;) i only mentioned because i joked about TRP earlier... besides there are prevalent mindsets in TRP that are just a <em>little</em> relevant to the discussion</p>

Named after American entertainer Barbra Streisand, whose 2003 attempt to suppress obscure photographs of her residence in Malibu, California, inadvertently drew further public attention to it. In pursuing legal action in court to get a cease and desist order led to the photos of Barbra Streisand&#39;s home being broadcast on national TV. Instead of a few hundred people knowing about it millions now know what her house looks like.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think the DC Madam actually knew all that much but killing her certainly woke a lot of people up at a time when 9/11 truth wasn&#39;t really mainstream yet. Killing the DC Madam caused a Streisand effect for the truther conspiracy movement. That was more than 10 years ago now.</p>

<p>She was apparently involved in a honeypot scam. Her girls would get information from powerful clients which would be used for blackmail.</p>

The only explanation I can think of is that it&#39;s a very effective way of blackmailing people in key positions to do what you want. It has to be systematic too because of the amount of people who &quot;enable&quot; the system to work - judges (not prosecuting), police (cover-ups), politicians (re-directing), media (deflecting), and so on.</p>

He announced during the primary season in 2016 that he had bombshell information (Palfrey&#39;s client lists) that would radically shake up the election, and promised that if the courts didn&#39;t allow the unsealing of the records by a certain date, he would go ahead and release them anyway and take whatever repercussions came from it. Supposedly he also had a &quot;kill switch&quot; that would see the records released if anything happened to him. The promised date came and went, and he extended the deadline a bunch of times until well after the primaries were over. Then one day he announced on his blog that he was starting a new social network to replace Twitter, and he never mentioned the records again. </p>
