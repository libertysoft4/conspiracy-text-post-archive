<blockquote>
<p>It operated in 78 countries, had over 400 branches, and had assets in excess of US$20 billion, making it the 7th largest private bank in the world by assets. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_Credit_and_Commerce_International">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_Credit_and_Commerce_International</a></p>
</blockquote>

<hr/>

<blockquote>
<p>BCCI was founded in 1972 by a Pakistani named Agha Hasan Abedi, who was an associate of Adham’s. Bush himself has an account at BCCI established while still director of the CIA. French customs will later raid the Paris BCCI branch and discover the account in Bush’s name.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr/>

<blockquote>
<p>Soon, BCCI becomes the fastest growing bank in the world. Time magazine will later describe BCCI as not just a bank, but also “a global intelligence operation and a Mafia-like enforcement squad. Operating primarily out of the bank’s offices in Karachi, Pakistan, the 1,500-employee black network has used sophisticated spy equipment and techniques, along with bribery, extortion, kidnapping and even, by some accounts, murder. The black network—so named by its own members—stops at almost nothing to further the bank’s aims the world over.”</p>
</blockquote>

<hr/>

<blockquote>
<p>Time magazine will later report that “the CIA kept some accounts in First American Bank, BCCI’s Washington arm.” But additionally, “Government investigators now have proof that First American had long been the CIA’s principal banker. Some of the more than 50 agency accounts uncovered at the bank date back to the 1950s. BCCI owned the CIA’s bank for a decade.” [TIME, 3/9/1992] The CIA soon learns that BCCI secretly controls the bank, if the CIA didn’t already know this from the very beginning. By 1985, the CIA will secretly inform the Treasury Department on the bank’s control by BCCI, which would be illegal. But no action is taken then or later, until BCCI is shut down. Sen. John Kerry’s BCCI investigation will later conclude, “even when the CIA knew that BCCI was as an institution a fundamentally corrupt criminal enterprise, it used both BCCI and First American, BCCI’s secretly held US subsidiary, for CIA operations. In the latter case, some First American officials actually knew of this use.”</p>
</blockquote>

<hr/>

<blockquote>
<p>Much of the billions of dollars in aid from Saudi Arabia and the CIA to the Afghan mujaheddin actually gets siphoned off by the Pakistani ISI. Melvin Goodman, a CIA analyst in the 1980s, will later say, “They were funding the wrong groups, and had little idea where the money was going or how it was being spent.” Sarkis Soghanalian, a middleman profiting from the aid, will later say, “The US did not want to get its hands dirty. So the Saudis’ money and the US money was handled by the ISI. I can tell you that more than three quarters of the money was skimmed off the top. What went to buy weapons for the Afghan fighters was peanuts.” Sognhanalian claims that most of the money went through various accounts held at the notoriously corrupt BCCI bank, then was distributed to the ISI </p>
</blockquote>

<hr/>

<blockquote>
<p>In 1991, the Guardian will report that for at least the past ten years, the CIA has secretly had nearly 500 Britons on its payroll and has been paying them through accounts at the criminal BCCI bank. </p>
</blockquote>

<hr/>

<blockquote>
<p>NBC News later reports that CIA Director William Casey secretly meets with the head of the criminal Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI) from 1984 until 1986, shortly before Casey’s death. The NBC report, quoting unnamed BCCI sources, will claim that Casey met with BCCI head Agha Hasan Abedi every few months in a luxury suite at the Madison Hotel in Washington. The two men allegedly discussed the Iran-Contra arms-for-hostages transactions and CIA weapons shipments to the mujaheddin in Afghanistan.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr/>

<blockquote>
<p>Bin Laden was also heavily invested in BCCI at the time </p>
</blockquote>

<hr/>

<blockquote>
<p>In March 1991, Sen. John Kerry’s Senate investigation of the criminal Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI) investigation hears about a secret CIA report on BCCI that was given to the Customs Service. Kerry’s office asks the CIA for a copy, but is told the report does not exist. After months of wrangling, more and more information about the CIA’s ties to BCCI comes out, and the CIA eventually gives Kerry that report and many other reports relating to BCCI. But crucially, the CIA does not share documents on CIA operations using the bank. Kerry’s public report will conclude, “Key questions about the relationship between US intelligence and BCCI cannot be answered at this time, and may never be.” </p>
</blockquote>

<hr/>

<blockquote>
<p>On July 11, 1991, retired Pakistani Brigadier General Inam ul-Haq is arrested by German authorities in Frankfurt. His arrest sheds light on the links between the criminal BCCI bank, the Pakistani government, and the A. Q. Khan nuclear network. In 1987, US intelligence attempted to arrest ul-Haq in the US for buying nuclear components there meant for Pakistan’s nuclear program, but some US officials tipped off the Pakistani government about the sting and only a low-level associate of ul-Haq’s was caught </p>
</blockquote>

<hr/>

<blockquote>
<p>In the wake of the July 1991 shutdown of the criminal BCCI bank (see July 5, 1991), the Pakistani government indicates that it is willing to shelter BCCI figures wanted in other countries. For instance, an international arrest warrant is issued for <strong>BCCI front man Ghaith Pharaon</strong>, and Pakistan has signed an extradition treaty with the US and other countries. But in August 1991, Pakistani Interior Minister Shujaat Hussain, who has authority to block extraditions, states flatly that Pharaon is his friend and he will give him citizenship, protection from extradition, and even immunity from local prosecution. Furthermore, the Los Angeles Times reports that some other senior and mid-level BCCI managers being investigated in the US have already fled to Pakistan.</p>

<p>Here is one more high profile case for good measure - </p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Pharaon</strong> is an international fugitive who has been wanted by the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for 17 years. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghaith_Phara">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghaith_Phara</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile, </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The US military has awarded an $80 million contract to a prominent Saudi financier who has been indicted by the US Justice Department. The contract to supply jet fuel to American bases in Afghanistan was awarded to the Attock Refinery Ltd, a Pakistani-based refinery owned by <strong>Gaith Pharaon</strong>. Pharaon is wanted in connection with his alleged role at the failed Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI), and the CenTrust savings and loan scandal, which cost US tax payers $1.7 billion.</p>

<p>The Saudi businessman was also named in a 2002 French parliamentary report as having links to informal money transfer networks called hawala, known to be used by traders and terrorists, including Al Qaeda.</p>

<p>This is only scratching the surface. There is for sure a lot more.</p>

<p>Some of the Saudi&#39;s who were tied to 9/11 also for a period of time held accounts at BCCI.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For sure. A good place to dig for connections would be The Carlyle Group and the ones recently arrested in the &#39;Saudi purge,&#39; particularly Prince Al-Waleed Bin Talal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dig into, research, same thing. BCCI is new to me. I was thinking of following the money to see how/if they all connect.</p>

<p>Prince Al-Waleed Bin Talal had rumors of being involved in funding the Saudi 9-11 hijackers. His money funded the Clinton cabal, Obama and a whole lot more around the world. He had a business relationship with the Bush family through the Carlyle Group way back when. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Gotcha, yes, Talal was apparently a &quot;money man&quot; according to &quot;20th Hijacker&quot; </p>

<p><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/saudiarabia/11390705/Saudi-princes-supported-al-Qaeda-before-911-claims-twentieth-hijacker.html">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/saudiarabia/11390705/Saudi-princes-supported-al-Qaeda-before-911-claims-twentieth-hijacker.html</a></p>

<p>&quot;Shaykh Osama wanted to keep a record who give money ... who is to be listened to or who contribute to – to the jihad,&quot; he said in broken English, according to the testimony that was first reported by the New York Times and has been seen by The Telegraph.</p>

<p>Among those listed were Prince Turki al-Faisal, then the Saudi intelligence chief; Prince Bandar Bin Sultan, the longtime Saudi ambassador to the United States and Prince al-Waleed bin Talal, a prominent billionaire investor. </p>

<p>I haven&#39;t seen Talal come up in regards to BCCI but I would imagine that there is some sort of connection in one way or another.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea his money has influenced a lot of major events and people around the world over the years. He was the largest shareholder at Citigroup. We learned from <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/8190">wikileaks emails</a> that Citi basicly picked Obama&#39;s cabinet in 08.

<p>I&#39;m not sure if/how he&#39;s connected to BCCI but I&#39;ll dig into them after this post. This area isn&#39;t my strong suit but I&#39;m learning. Thanks for post man.</p>
