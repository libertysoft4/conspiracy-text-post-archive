    <div class="md"><p>We&#39;ll take for example both sides.</p>

<p>Say I&#39;m a normal left leaning fellow, and I see something on r/all about the Alt-Right on one of the many subreddits dedicated to that exact thing. Now I&#39;m heated because I can&#39;t believe the Nazis have such braggadocios and offensive types trying to turn the internet into a nazi-infested fuckfest. Now, with worries of pornhub&#39;s only category being blondes they take to the net. They come to conspiracy and they search out the first right leaning post they find and shit all over it. They travel down and find the comments and pounces, calls them fascists, murderers, and compare them to the foulest members of their side. This causes the left to have a kneejerk reaction to any right leaning source because it is inherently as evil as the Nazis. </p>

<p>Now, imagine I&#39;m right leaning. I live in the south, and have had a fairly poor/modest background and you go to all and see these communist sites demanding that your &quot;ilk&quot; (great word) should be eliminated out of the gene pool. Basically the communist groups tend to enjoy triggering and berating right leaning people with all the same tactics they believe that white people use on all minorities (always a good excuse if you want to damage another human being). Now the right leaners will go to the safety of the right and start attacks anyone who attacks the right and espouses leftist narratives. They will pull away from leftist sources, because they are not discussing the actual realities of their area in favor of rhetoric.</p>

<p>They force us to connect to our ourskirt radicals by using the other sides radicals to push any moderate away from other moderates.</p>

<p>Now, let&#39;s pretend like this behavior isn&#39;t coerced by money and political groups.</p>

<p>Lets not pretend like we know anything about Roy Moore due to actual politics and not a result of the 2016 election and the fight for a blue midterm?</p>

<p>These groups are trying to game perception, and I think that&#39;s fairly obvious based on internet message boards like this one compared to modern reality.</p>

<p>Just look at this subreddit within the last month.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean yeah man, I get that all politicians are generally pieces of garbage. Yet I see it in a simple way. Those who want more government and those who want less. This is my left right spectrum.</p>

<p>(Not to mention those fucks that call themselves &quot;alt right&quot; because they are literally neo Nazis [I&#39;ve been to the meetings] fuck those guys, they are left on my scale{based on their proclivity towards censorship and large government} I mean main steam left want to kill white, none main stream &quot;left&quot; want to kill everyone else. Same shit, you know what I mean)</p>

<p>Anyhow I get it, government is lame. I live in the woods and come to town to comment on Reddit. Or I wish that was my life... the point is that the technocracy is already more powerful than us bro, do to this insane amount of sheep. </p>

<p>So what do we do bro? It&#39;s feeble to even consider we could free these fools. So then what? We just live our life, yeah? Why bother with the stress? Buddha say reality is what you acknowledge. Thus why even bother with the fools?</p>

<p>Sure it has its fun, The Bleak idealism of maybe freeing one or two minds... yet just looking at the Grand scale, what is the point. Doctor JP said that we are all connected to each other. an organism of unanimity through shared thought. Every thought you have is only that which another has given.</p>

<p>The dire struggle between Good and Evil has been waged for millennia. Yet in the end, AI will reign supreme. So why not just get fat and watch Parks and Recreation? Please my fellow worrier, tell me why we both with these sponges?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s what it actually does:</p>

<p>The Declaratory Ruling, Report and Order, and Order 
adopted by the Commission takes the following steps to achieve these goals:
Declaratory Ruling</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Restores the classification of broadband Internet access service as an “information 
service” under Title I of the Communications Act—the classification affirmed by the 
Supreme Court in the 2005 Brand X case.  </p></li>
<li><p>Reinstates the classification of mobile broadband Internet access service as a private 
mobile service.</p></li>
<li><p>Finds that the regulatory uncertainty created by utility
-style Title II regulation has 
reduced Internet service provider (ISP) investment in networks, as well as hampered 
innovation, particularly among small ISPs serving rural consumers.</p></li>
<li><p>Finds that public policy, in addition to legal analysis, supports the information service 
classification, because it is more likely to encourage broadband investment and 
innovation, thereby furthering the goal of closing the digital divide and benefitting the 
entire Internet ecosystem.</p></li>
<li><p>Restores broadband consumer protection authority to the Federal Trade Commission 
(FTC), enabling it to apply its extensive expertise to provide uniform online 
protections against unfair, deceptive, and anticompetitive practices.
Report and Order</p></li>
<li><p>Requires that ISPs disclose information about their practices to consumers, 
entrepreneurs, and the Commission, including any blocking, throttling, paid 
prioritization, or affiliated prioritization.</p></li>
<li><p>Finds that transparency, combined with market forces as well as antitrust and consumer 
protection laws, achieve benefits comparable to those of the 2015 “bright line” rules at 
lower cost.</p></li>
<li><p>Eliminates the vague and expansive Internet Conduct Standard, under which the FCC 
could micromanage innovative business models.
Order</p></li>
<li><p>Finds that the public interest is not served by adding to the already
-voluminous record 
in this proceeding additional materials, including confidential materials submitted in 
other proceedings.</p></li>
</ul>

    <div class="md"><p>The majority of the piece is disinformation. What you think RIF does is actually what Title II did, which RIF nullified. It&#39;s depressing that, in a conspiracy theory community, you&#39;d rather have me do the same thing this 4chan poster did which lead to you being misinformed in the first place, and interpret it for you.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll give it a shot though, even though it will be difficult since this entire post is a narrative, and doesn&#39;t actually say much about RIF or Title II.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>NN was not a move in a sequence of events to completely take over the internet. It (Title II) was a set of regulations designed to prevent ISPs from taking advantage of consumers. I posted an excerpt in another comment in this thread, I believe.</p></li>
<li><p>NN was heavily advertised because, although Google and Facebook and Amazon may be huge companies, they aren&#39;t the ones who own the infrastructure to deliver internet. They still have to deal with ISPs. This wasn&#39;t a problem under Title II, but now the ISPs have almost full power to make the final decision with regard to how a customer will be treated. Now Google, Amazon, Facebook etc have to deal with them if they aren&#39;t happy about something, and they can&#39;t count on ISPs to be obligated to provide a fair, predictable, and reliable service. This means their (G, A, FB)&#39;s services are at risk of degraded delivery and reliability.</p></li>
<li><p>NN has nothing to do with Ford, Rockefeller, or Carnegie.</p></li>
<li><p>FCC did not hold ISPs accountable to the Open-Internet rules prior to Title I. Title I is what enacted these regulations.</p></li>
<li><p>NN has little to do with the Clintons, Democrats, or globalists. The repeated inclusion of these labels</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure I have examples.  How about Canadian Facebook friends who never in the last ten years ever spoke up about any major political issues happening in Canada, never once pushed people how to vote in a local, provincial, or federal election, and yet somehow, during 2016, began posting shit constantly from Media Matters, Occupy Democrats, Buzz feed, Salon, etc, all anti-Trump content.</p>

<p>And this became constant.  Everyday.  They went from having normal walls talking about movies and tv shows and work related things to constantly having an opinion on American politics, while having zero American citizenship and since being on Facebook have not once posted about a trip to the States.  All of a sudden they focus on American politics above their own countrys&#39; political landscape.</p>

<p>I love the posts that last week were telling all their friends how we must vote against Roy Moore.  Uh, you all live in Canada, your friends list is Canadian, you don&#39;t live in Alabama, and you are not allowed to vote in any American election.  Where were these people when the Liberal gas scandal of the last election was happening?  Silence.  How about when Harper passed bill C-51?  Silence.  No push to vote against Harper or to vote a certain party.  No links to articles about local political scandals.  Nothing.  But now some election in a state you&#39;re never setting foot in that doesnt affect your life or your job in any real tangibke way is the most important thing ever and is above any local political issues you are actually facing?  Give me a break.</p>

The Democrats can&#39;t seem to give us common sense policy without slipping in government abuse like a trojan horse, and the Republicans as contrarian as always are perfectly content to simply dismantle everything the Democrats do without attempting to actually solve real problems that even Republican voters unanimously agree are real and pressing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He chooses his skin color. There&#39;s nothing remotely ironic about mocking how someone chooses to present themself, after that person spends so much time attacking others for how they look.</p>

<p>What is ironic is Trump and his followers getting triggered over such things, after they demand that no one be PC.</p>

<p>Are you saying you&#39;re anti-net neutrality?? You really want Comcast or Spectrum or whoever choosing what you can consume or post on the internet, including denying access to sites like this if we dare say anything bad about them? And I&#39;m the one who&#39;s a victim of propaganda? Lol</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean yeah man, I get that all politicians are generally pieces of garbage. Yet I see it in a simple way. Those who want more government and those who want less. This is my left right spectrum.</p>

<p>(Not to mention those fucks that call themselves &quot;alt right&quot; because they are literally neo Nazis [I&#39;ve been to the meetings] fuck those guys, they are left on my scale{based on their proclivity towards censorship and large government} I mean main steam left want to kill white, none main stream &quot;left&quot; want to kill everyone else. Same shit, you know what I mean)</p>

<p>Anyhow I get it, government is lame. I live in the woods and come to town to comment on Reddit. Or I wish that was my life... the point is that the technocracy is already more powerful than us bro, do to this insane amount of sheep. </p>

<p>So what do we do bro? It&#39;s feeble to even consider we could free these fools. So then what? We just live our life, yeah? Why bother with the stress? Buddha say reality is what you acknowledge. Thus why even bother with the fools?</p>

<p>Sure it has its fun, The Bleak idealism of maybe freeing one or two minds... yet just looking at the Grand scale, what is the point. Doctor JP said that we are all connected to each other. an organism of unanimity through shared thought. Every thought you have is only that which another has given.</p>

<p>The dire struggle between Good and Evil has been waged for millennia. Yet in the end, AI will reign supreme. So why not just get fat and watch Parks and Recreation? Please my fellow worrier, tell me why we both with these sponges?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A president who calls for taking out families of suspected criminals, a president who calls for torture for fun, a president who tells police to rough up suspects and gives them military gear, a president who so loves law and order that he will remove anyone investigating his crimes, a president who repeatedly asks why we don&#39;t use more nukes</p>

<p>That&#39;s all normal to you?</p>
