<p>People who keep track and collect links for specific users in this forum are either mentally ill or paid agents. People who laugh at others because of their beliefs are bigots. TopMinds is a forum based off of bigotry and harassment. As long as top minds exists reddit cannot be said to value diversity. Because they allow a forum that is hate based bigotry against diverse opinions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>RMFN, I found this conversation via TMOR.  I hope you can learn to think of it like I do...I had this old post that wasn&#39;t going anywhere I think it had 5 or 6 views, when TMOR decided to feature it on their page.  Think about it...my OP has reached almost 1,000 people now that I never would have been able to reach on my own.  That is almost 1,000 people who would never have heard my voice or thoughts without them.  They are welcomed to &#39;harass&#39; me until the cows come home.  I am delighted to get the exposure.  Do you know how many people might reject my ideas outright...but will stew upon them over time?  </p>

<p>It is frigging genious man...it doesn&#39;t get any better than that...but you have to look at it correctly, they are a vehicle to get you exposure...nothing more.  Trust me...you may not like it but it is really a good thing for, in my case, hard Alt-Right ideologies.</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t really gotten into this yet but I can imagine (as I am banned and have nothing to lose) that a concerted effort to counter stalk TMOR would be highly profitable in destroying them and bring them down if you wanted.  But enough people would have to sub and then violate all their rules OUTSIDE their domain and spoil the &#39;fun&#39; in the hit pieces, I always try and give the people they stalk a heads up if I know them.  Fuck &#39;em...they can&#39;t help being mentally ill, it is part of (((their genetics))).  But there is no reason to just let them pick off people, or harass them when we are the vast majority of users of Reddit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK...I know you are probably tired of hearing from me and this is slightly ironic because it was actually a shower thought.  Here goes.  </p>

<p>The comment above shows a clear and systematic campaign of harassment against specific Reddit Users, in this case YOU, RMFN are being systematically targeted by the mod u/MAGA_Hatter; that is coordinated harassment via one of the MODS of TMOR...and indicates that the Subreddit TMOR actually classifies and targets individual reddit users in a coordinated campaign of intimidation, prejudice and harassment.</p>

<p>I have archived the subreddit and downloaded the zip showing your post on the front page of TMOR along with this <a href="https://imgur.com/a/hYxbr">image of TMOR with your post on it</a>.  Use all the photos here...including the one at the top to prove your case (because this is now centered around you)...</p>

<p>Wanna know what the absolute best part is?  Being mentally ill, they don&#39;t understand Indo-European psychology and that, yeah, we might mock something at first because of (((public pressure))), but deep down, inside it is going to burn and weigh on the IE soul, because they aren&#39;t given over to immoral and debased thinking and they know that (((those in power and their slaves like MAGA_Hater))) are wrong, evil and deviant. I couldn&#39;t have planned it better...planning my next move to skewer them further...this is actually a lot more enjoyable than I thought it was going to be.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>:o Ty for replying. </p>

<p>If its literally only 6-15 people or whatever, let the non-hate TMOR uses just do their thing, that is such an insignificant amount compared to the people who actually visit this sub for whatever reasons. </p>

<p>I do appreciate that you do keep on top of abusive TMOR users, it is likely that you have already banned the abusive ones, and the ones that remake accounts to come back likely tippy-toe around the previously broken rules, which is understandable. </p>

<p>I appreciate the response, I never realized there was such an insignificant amount of TMOR users here though, seems like the issue is more with users not blocking things they don&#39;t like. (EX: &quot;Your r/conspiracy thread was just linked to TMOR&quot;, then they proceed to go to TMOR, to that thread, and freak out that there is a thread on another subreddit etc etc, although TMOR users don&#39;t listen to reason, there is nothing reasonable about arguing with a brick wall. </p>

<p>James, can you please ban TopMind users at this point, screw it, this is becoming too stupid, its becoming pathetic. They are openly attacking users and I submitted it to the reddit admins as directed hate towards me and its still up. There is no reason for this type of directed hate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a mystery as to why they&#39;re still on Reddit. They were causing issues about a year ago, actual stalking and harassing and threatening of users, I outed some of them and their sock puppets, they had to dial it back. I think a deal was struck behind the scenes and we never really learned what happened. They probably got a slap on the wrist from admins and told to stop harassing. They used to be able to just come into <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> or any sub and brigade away, using TotesMessenger bot as a notification system flagging the victims for the attackers. TotesMessenger was banned from this sub at least, but the AIPAC scum are still cockroaching about. They have some sort of position of privilege where they&#39;re allowed to operate in the disinterest of just about anyone who&#39;s encountered them. I don&#39;t really get that. AIPAC, Hasbara, JIDF, not sure exactly who they are but it&#39;s some kind of information control outfit pretending to be &quot;just regular assholes here for a laugh&quot;. <em>Nobody</em> spends that much time laughing at conspiracy theorists unless they&#39;re being paid or held at gunpoint. Ahh, so that&#39;s what we do with those guys in Guantanamo, make them get on the internet and sling the government propaganda.</p>
