<p>If he/she were to say &quot;so the blacks have hated been by vast different groups (christians, muslims) but we are the weird ones for not trusting them? Makes you wonder who&#39;s ink charge&quot; With absolutely no context or qualifying language it would be fucking racist.  Would it not be? </p>

<p>And it would be a completely different thing if he were to point out specific crimes by specific Jewish people to show why we shouldnt trust those people.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, one of the central tenets of Judaism is that the Jews are God&#39;s one and only chosen people, and that they are destined to rule over the lesser races.  This leads directly to Zionism, the proponents of which believe that the interests of Israel should take precedence over those of all other nations.</p>
