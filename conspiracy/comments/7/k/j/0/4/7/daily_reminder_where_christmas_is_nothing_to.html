    <div class="md"><p>Its less than a days pay at minimum wage.  I understand there are a lot factors (assuming a single person), my only point is its not really crazy expansive for the benefit.

    <div class="md"><p>It’s a good idea year round to contribute something to an organization local to you that provides services to the homeless. I haven’t done a lot but I’ve shared my time and talents with such an organization where I live, and brought others along with me to do the same. It was very well received. We as individuals can’t completely solve the homeless problem, but we can help those who are trying. If you can’t donate money or goods you can donate your time. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t understand all the vitriol and hate in the comments of this post. Yes, there are many homeless that are addicts. Yes, many homeless also have mental health issues. They are all still human, though. Op is right. For many of us in the northern hemisphere, we are entering what can be a very cold season. Lots of us also live in areas where temperatures can drop low enough to kill a person with inadequate protection from exposure. Maybe, if you happen to be in an area I&#39;ve just described and see a person on the streets that you think could be in danger from the elements, instead of cursing them under your breath for whatever perceived wrong that you believe they have committed to put themselves in their situation maybe you could show compassion and try to help them out. Many groups will be happy to come and offer to take the person to someplace safe. The homeless person always has the right to refuse help when it arrives. All you have to do is make a quick call and then be on your merry way. In the md/dc/va area the number to call 1-800-535-7252. You can also dial 311 in many parts of the US and Canada and let them know the situation. It&#39;s simple. It doesn&#39;t take long. You don&#39;t need to engage with the homeless person in question and you could potentially save a life. </p>
