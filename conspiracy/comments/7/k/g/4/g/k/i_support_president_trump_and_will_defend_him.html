If we allow Trump to be driven out of office based on Deep State lies and innuendo, it could happen to a President whose policies I <em>do</em> support, and would effectively neuter the Presidency. </p>

<p>As such, I will stand with you in defending the Office of the Presidency, and its integrity and legitimacy, so that the Republic does not crumble yet further. I do not agree with Trumps policies or politics, but I recognize that he was Democratically elected in a Constitutionally appropriate manner. Fuck the Corporatists, I refuse to let them use Russia as an excuse to ignore the Progressive base of the Party and not change. </p>

<p>You&#39;ve got a lot of faith in that.</p>

<p>Considering they claimed to have this bombshell information before an &quot;investigation&quot; ever existed, and before Trump ever took office, that doesn&#39;t make any sense. If the IC had <em>proof</em> that Trump was a Russian plant who &quot;subverted democracy&quot; as you claim, they could have come forward <em>before</em> he was nominated. They did not. That would have been the time to save the country from this supposed &quot;plant&quot;. Not allow it to devolve into political theater. The IC has nothing and until I see <em>proof</em> I will assume they are lying to us, as they <em>always do</em>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do have a lot of faith in that, but it is based only on the wealth of circumstantial evidence available.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>considering they claimed</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Who is “they”? Mueller’s team has made nearly zero statements about their investigation. They have allowed their legal proceedings to speak for themselves.</p>

<p>The intelligence community at large has made no official statements regarding Trump/Russia collusion. Everything you are referring to is either unofficial statements, statements from former members based on their expertise and conjecture, or statements regarding the fact that Russia meddled in the election, but <em>not</em> if Russia did so in collusion with Trump’s campaign.</p>

<p>They would not have come forward with that evidence before his nomination, because there would be no legal mechanism by which to do so. You can’t just dump evidence. You need to build a legal case around that evidence, which is what Muller’s team has been doing for the last seven months, building on the case being built by the FBI beforehand.</p>

<p>You will see your proof soon enough, I guess.</p>
