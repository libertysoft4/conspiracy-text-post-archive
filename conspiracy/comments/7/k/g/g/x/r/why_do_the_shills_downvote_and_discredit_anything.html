    <div class="md"><p>The museum isn&#39;t adjoining the restaurant at all. It&#39;s in another part of the city. There is a basement in his other restaurant on the same street though. The whole point though is that PG was never about a basement, the media tried to say it was all about some crazy theory about keeping kids in a basement and that there wasn&#39;t even a basement there, as a way to try and make the investigation by concerned citizens and independent journalists and researchers sound like some crazy nutso conspiracy theory propagated by loony alt right Trump supporters. Anyone who actually looked at the investigation and followed what people were finding and talking about realised pretty quickly that the supposed &#39;debunking&#39; was a total cover up and didn&#39;t actually address any of the legitimate concerns and information brought up by the people who were looking into it.</p>

<p>Rubbish: the existence of a basement was a major feature of early pizzagate discussions, and that&#39;s why pizzagaters got all excited when they thought they&#39;d caught Alefantis lying about it. People were constantly speculating about the basement, hidden rooms, and connections to the sewers through which the children were delivered. It was a nutso theory, and so some people tried to rebrand &quot;pizzagate&quot; as &quot;pedogate&quot; so that they could claim any child abuse case was evidence that they&#39;d been right all along.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>James Alefnatis <em>never</em> admitted Comet Ping Pong had a basement. In an interview, he talked about harvesting tonnes of tomatoes, canning them, and storing them in the basement. He never said &quot;in the basement of Comet Ping Pong&quot;, and clearly they weren&#39;t growing tonnes of tomatoes there, but pizzagaters were so desperate to catch him out in a lie that they just ignored what he actually said. In fact, in another interview he said it was the basement of Buck&#39;s Fishing and Camping.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>according to the one email you can rent pizza by the hour now..</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, an email said &quot;Would love to get a pizza for an hour&quot;. It&#39;s just like saying &quot;grab lunch for an hour&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>visitor&#39;s experience:
So, an anonymous person saw some teenagers playing foosball and a parent trying to interest her child in playing foosball. Apparently playing foosball for any length of time is inconceivable to this woman unless it&#39;s for some nefarious purpose. And the missing people? Well, if she had bothered to check before she made this inane video, she&#39;d know there&#39;s a back door to the back bar.</p>

<p>and then there&#39;s this point</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Really? Dyar&#39;s tunnels were kilometres away from Comet Ping Pong and apparently amounted to only about 400 metres in total length across several levels. And where&#39;s the proof they even exist any more? Considering they were discovered when a truck fell through the road, they were probably filled in at the time.</p>

She said he always gave her the mega creeps but she couldn&#39;t say anything because of who he was. Apparently he was super touchy feely. And it wasn&#39;t just her who told me that. One of my neighbors said she walked past him on the street one day when he was in her late teens and was wearing a novelty &quot;kiss me I&#39;m Italian&quot; button and the fucker actually did it without even asking. He&#39;s been a known creep for years. </p>

If not, then either it doesn&#39;t face there normally or it&#39;s commonly facing in another direction.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah, no, the proof is there for you to see right now – log onto the camera and see if it&#39;s pointed at Comet Ping Pong. Log onto it tomorrow and see itf it&#39;s pointed at Comet Ping Pong. Log onto it every day and see if it&#39;s pointed at Comet Ping Pong. And ask yourself why it would be pointed at Comet Ping Pong anyway when it&#39;s a <em>traffic</em> camera. Or why a traffic camera mounted Or why a traffic camera mounted at the southern corner of the Connecticut Avenue and Nebraska Avenue intersection looking northwards across the intersection would normally be pointed northeast across the road at a block of shops.</p>

<p>But instead of seeing for yourself, you&#39;d rather just believe that they point a traffic camera at a pizzeria.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep, the whole &#39;fake news&#39; thing suddenly became a huge thing right after the PG stuff started getting out. The truth is that actual fake news websites, the kinds that put out ridiculous obviously fake sensationalised stories, have been around for years and they were never mentioned before, they were never a problem because most people recognized they were nto based on any evidence and were just stupid. PG though had plenty of evidence - evidence at the very least that something weird was going on and that these politicians were into some weird stuff, connected with weird people and that they had real questions to answer about the kinds of things they were up to. So the &#39;fake news&#39; trope was born as a way to discredit it all, and conspiracy theories in general, as more and more people started waking up to the fact that the msm was not the honest bastion of free speech and holding power to account that people had been led to believe. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just worry that this is our perspective, those of us who are paying attention, who are engaged and have watched this bullshit begin and develop here on Reddit and elsewhere. Does the average American care? I have a lot of faith in the American People, but I do not know how many are truly tuned into Pgate/Pedogate and the censorship of the internet that began and continues. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I agree, but this is why they are attempting to drive the average American into a constant state of destitution and economic instability. If one is too worried about providing for their family and putting food on the table on a day to day or paycheck to paycheck basis, do they really have time to tune into the larger issues of the country? They know shit is bad, but they don&#39;t know the specifics, because they&#39;re worried about their kids and their futures. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fake news has existed for years, but it’s different when it says National Enquirer on the top than when fake sites are doing everything they can to look like a legitimate news organization but are intentionally spreading knowingly false information. I agree Neon Nettle is garbage. I don’t know how Facebook is doing their algorithm thing. Pizzagate, in my opinion, fits a generic definition of fake news, at least with the way it is talked about here (often) as a matter of fact despite the circunstancial nature of the evidence, but the topic itself is not what I would consider inherently fake news. I do believe there are people that are genuinely suspicious of what they perceive as creepy stuff, and their feelings are not fake, whether I disagree with them or not. </p>

<p>Just more unsubstantiated nonsense. The closest thing you have to the truth is the Clintons bailing out someone who was by all accounts misguidedly trying to move kids out of a disaster area - a ridiculously inept ultra-Christian who was clearly too stupid to know she was breaking the law when she thought she was doing &quot;God&#39;s work&quot;.</p>

<p>What you don&#39;t have is any proof - nay, any <em>evidence</em> at all - that she was involved in anything intentionally nefarious.</p>

<p>Even if the Haiti thing is a genuine scandal, it still has nothing to do with Podesta, Alefantis, or pizza. Calling it part of &quot;Pizzagate&quot; is an attempt to ground and legitimize all of the <em>total fucking nonsense</em> that comprises what Pizzagate <em>actually is</em>. Just because Pizzagaters <em>also</em> believe the Clintons were running a sex-trade out of Haiti doesn&#39;t make the sex-trade out of Haiti theory part of Pizzagate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There’s literally nothing in there I haven’t read before. I will admit the article you linked was better written and researched than most. It admits the Arch has nothing to do with the Dahmer pose (but does spend a lot of time talking about the similarities). Paintings of women with no heads doesn’t make Tony Podesta a murderer or a pedophile. I disagree that knowing Maria Abromovich makes them occultists. Kleinman is in a shitty shock band, so I’m not clutching pearls over what she said, and her connection to this seems to be their band player there and nothing more. I’ve got a collection of horror movies in my house that if you used to define me as a person would be pretty damning, that doesn’t make me a slasher with a hockey mask. 
Which part seals the deal for you? What is the best piece of evidence you see for your case? </p>

<p>You&#39;re missing my point, which was that for the paintings to promote violence, they would have to somehow make it appear attractive or justified. If you find them creepy, I don&#39;t see how you think they&#39;re promoting violence.</p>

<p>That&#39;s what a lot of people in this thread have basically tried to do. They try to use clever wordplay to get me to admit it without realizing it. It&#39;s very obvious they&#39;re here to accuse and to normalize pedophilia. Maybe your word play is more subtle but I think this is where you are trying to get at with me.</p>

<p>Just because you didn&#39;t accuse me directly but implied it through a question doesn&#39;t really change much in fact you&#39;re not so subtle at all. Your intentions are very obvious and I&#39;m here to expose them. Slowly but surely.</p>

<p>Any examples of where someone&#39;s trying to get you to admit something you don&#39;t believe? Frankly, I think you&#39;re being paranoid: you&#39;re not the point of the discussion – the lack of evidence for pizzagate is. And nobody here is normalising paedophilia: child abuse is an absolutely vile crime that can have devastating lifelong consequences for its victims. And, precisely because it is such a horrendous crime, people shouldn&#39;t go round doing such inane things as replacing words in someone else&#39;s emails with terms like &quot;little girl&quot; and then claiming they&#39;ve proved that person&#39;s a child abuser.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Just because you didn&#39;t accuse me directly but implied it through a question doesn&#39;t really change much in fact you&#39;re not so subtle at all.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Chill out. I asked a clarifying question because I didn&#39;t understand your logic. I&#39;m not implying that you are a paedophile at all. That would be ridiculous considering (to repeat myself) my whole point is that people shouldn&#39;t be round accusing other people of such vile crimes without credible evidence.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Your intentions are very obvious and I&#39;m here to expose them. Slowly but surely.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Get over yourself – you&#39;re not exposing anything, but you are avoiding answering questions. If you want to know something from me, just ask it.</p>

<p>Now, how about we get back to the discussion and you tell me what evidence you have to back up that Alefantis and Podesta have &quot;an obsession with a creepy lifestyle&quot;. In case you&#39;ve missed it, my not-at-all-subtle intention here is to get you to answer that question and not deflect again.</p>

<p>So is an interest in death.</p>

<p>So, you admit you are obssessed with sex and you have challenging Beardsley prints: you must be a rapist or a sexual harasser on the level of Harvey Weinstein. At least, that&#39;s how the pizzagate logic works for Tony Podesta: he owns some confronting art therefore he&#39;s a child abuser.</p>

<p>The people in the painting <em>Vresište</em> do not look like children to me; they look like women. And, considering a lot of Djurdjevic&#39;s paintings show <a href="http://www.c-collection.org/files/profile/c74d97b01eae257e44aa9d5bade97baf/bibbon_-170x90cm_-oil-on-canvas_-2009-10_3351.jpg">similarly blank-faced people in unanimated poses</a>, I can&#39;t even say they&#39;re meant to be dead.</p>

<p>So, how about <a href="http://www.actionfigurefury.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/McFarlane-Walking-Dead-TV-Series-Daryl-Dixon-Resin-Statue-side.jpg">this</a> or <a href="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vFpB-obDJOc/maxresdefault.jpg">this</a> or <a href="http://news.entertainmentearth.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Walking-Dead-Negan-Statue-012-copy.jpg">this</a> or <a href="https://www.minimodelshop.co.uk/picture/SideshowCollectibles-200051/friday-the-13th-jason-voorhees-the-terror-of-crystal-lake-polystone-statue-sideshow-collectibles-200051-b.jpg">this</a>?

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Did we forget about David Seaman saying he has a source saying the FBI is seriously investigating this matter&quot; You mean a random dude on the internet who has a site deeply invested in making PG a real thing?</p>

<p>&quot;Looks like we got an investigation boys.&quot; Thats your evidence? Really? You say he proved he had contact. Whats his proof? Do you really trust some random dude on the internet supporting a 4chan theory that the government is running a literal child sex ring for more than 30 years involving some the most important people in the world? All with zero victims coming forward, zero family members of victims coming forward, and LITERALLY zero evidence? And it was only figured out now because someone said they wanted to get some pizza in an email? DC is full of reporters and journalists looking to make it big with a huge story like an underground pizza ring involving world leaders. But somehow nobody has found it yet. Interesting.</p>

<p>Or the fact that if there really was such a high level crime being committed, and they managed to hide it for so long, would they really just casually joke about it in emails? And why the FUCK would they involve a pizzeria in DC? These people own enormous swathes of land right outside DC where they could molest children free of any police for miles.</p>

<p>Pizzagate is just a dumb cash grab made to trick rubes and conservatives in to spending their time watching ads and buying bumper stickers. Isn&#39;t it funny how it matches up with all the people the RNC hates? You are a victim of the new MSM. Don&#39;t be a sucker.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah, Obamas hotdogs. Here:</p>

<p>TL;DR, The email&#39;s writer hates Obama and is making a baseless accusations in private. He has no inside knowledge of Obama&#39;s dealings and was most likely regurgitating some bullshit/talking point he heard, exaggerating, joking, and/or making it up from whole cloth.</p>

<p>Explain the $60,000 hot dog party.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here is the explanation: some random guy who votes Republican saw a random blog post shared on Facebook about how OBUMMER was WASTING TAXPAYER MONEY on such FRIVOLITIES as PARTIES with CATERING, and referenced that blog post in an email to coworkers. It was never based in fact. It was just a partisan talking-point that got circulated among some dude&#39;s friends and co-workers.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s just do the hot dog one. That&#39;s taxpayer money, so there should be a paper trail. And it&#39;s false on its face - you can&#39;t bring outside food into the White House. So - what exactly is being discussed?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>First of all, this is <a href="https://wikileaks.org/gifiles/docs/12/1223066_re-get-ready-for-chicago-hot-dog-friday-.html">an intra-office email in Stratfor.</a> It has nothing to do with Podesta or Clinton. Fred Burton of Stratfor said &quot;I think Obama spent about $65,000 of the tax-payers money flying in pizza/dogs from Chicago for a private party at the White House not long ago.&quot; He&#39;s not claiming to have any special, inside knowledge, so he is probably referring to something in the news.  The email was in May 2009. Just a few weeks earlier, there was a very minor kerfuffle about Obama flying in Pizza. Though the pizza had Chicago-themed names, it was actually from St. Louis, which made some Chicago pizzerias mad.</p>

</ul>

<p>Some right-wing bloggers and a few in the media tried to stir up anger at Obama for extravagance or wasting taxpayers&#39; money, but it turned out that no taxpayer money was used to fly the food out.</p>

<p>The pizzeria brought dough and sauce with them, but the pizzas were <a href="http://www.riverfronttimes.com/foodblog/2009/04/16/pis-chris-sommers-deep-dishes-on-cooking-at-the-white-houseand-the-controversy">prepared in the White House kitchen</a>, supervised by the White House chefs.

<p>&quot;Who all is in the Austin office today who is going to want pizza? We &gt; only have one slice and we need to know how thinly to slice it.&quot;</p>

<p>The handkerchief one is definitely the most bizarre. Glad you acknowledged that. </p>

<p>Then there&#39;s the $75 000 worth of &#39;hot dogs&#39; flown into the whitehouse for a function (not from the podesta email but related)</p>

<p>And beyond that, it&#39;s rather coincidental that so many establishments (Besta PizzaJPG, TerasolPNG, Comet Ping PongJPG, Politics &amp; Prose) on a single block have FBI-verified pedo symbols integrated in their logos and messaging</p>

<li><p>Literally that. Will I think better on a stomach full of cheese (from the box you usually give) or pasta (the gift you gave this year). Also there’s emails from the year before talking about the previous year’s gift. Along way to go to set up a code word sentence a year later. </p></li>
<li><p>Literally that. I’ve got an hour lunch would you like to meet up during that time for pizza. ‘You wanna go get drinks for an hour or two?’ would be a more normal sentence, but I fail to see how this is weird. </p></li>
<li><p>Its a joke. Like a cheap boss joke. I’m going to only buy one slice ha ha. It’ll be like Jesus, and the loaves and fishes. If we slice it thin enough everyone can have a slice. </p></li>
<li><p>Agreed handkerchief is weird. Still could be any number of things as well as code. A handkerchief with marinara on it. A handkerchief someone has drawn on. It could be a reference or inside joke we don’t get. It could also be code. </p></li>
<li><p>Lol. It was $65,000. It was a made up number (‘I think’ is the phrasing in the email) mentioned in an email as an offhand remark meant to criticize Obama’s spending. It was also on pizza and dogs. Why do I have the facts better than you on this?</p></li>
<li><p>The triangle is ubiquitous (especially when it comes to pizza logos), but sure, that’s a weird coincidence. I guess more logo designers should be aware of FBI press releases so they can avoid stuff like that, unless it was intentional of course. The ping pong paddles being the butterfly is a real big stretch. The Terasol logo is a hand in a heart, not a spiral heart. I couldn’t find any claims about the politics and prose logo. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>I count two weird coincidences tops. If those are enough for you, by all means dig, but that is not enough for me, and it is definitely not enough to call someone a pedophile. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Anyone who doesn’t agree with my theory must be a shill! I personally downvote it when, like in this post here, it intentionally spreads misleading info, like claiming Podesta owns all of those art pieces (or at least not pointing out only 2 of the paintings are his). Reasons I think it’s bullshit...
There are no victims that I know of. The only code words mentioned that have a legitimate history are pizza. Walnut sauce isn’t a code word. Cheese pizza is never mentioned in all of the emails. It is often pushed as a fact that Podesta and Alefantis are pedo’s, when that is not a fact, it is speculation at best. Hotard is not evidence of criminal behavior or intent. Playing dominoes on cheese or pasta refers literally to playing dominoes with a stomach full of one of those two foods. The pool email went out to multiple parties, and kids are fun. 4chan whipped people into a frenzy and people that don’t do well with critical thinking are easily swayed by a couple of Instagram pictures with gay stuff in it. </p>

It seems more likely to me that’s not the context he’s using it in based on what’s in the pictures he’s posted with that hashtag. I could be wrong. That’s still not enough to call him a pedo in my mind, and to me it reeks of 4chan making something fit the result they were looking for. </p>

Chicken lover yes, but I have no evidence he’s using your obscure slang term, could be, but it seems more to me likely they ate some chicken than they are soliciting. The other photo he is wearing a shirt that says Butt. Yikes! Is there any evidence Cum Panda refers to children and isn’t just a Donkey Punch variant that 4chan has now said is about kids? Or is it just an inside joke we aren’t privy to that now has been assigned a deeper meaning despite it appearing in Instagram posts without children in them (and having panda related items in the pictures)? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The word &quot;shills&quot; is thrown around in this sub, and the meaning has been boiled down to &quot;someone who doesn&#39;t agree with a particular conspiracy theory&quot;.  More and more people, in this sub and elsewhere, got tired of pizzagate because after digging and reading emails and looking at all the &quot;evidence&quot; in it&#39;s proper context, it adds up to nothing at all.</p>

<p>And yet, in every single comment section, I see people cherry picking the same emails while leaving out the context of the emails to make them sound more nefarious than they are.  I see people taking art out of the context of the artist&#39;s intentions.  So on and so forth.</p>

<p>It was worth looking into, but it didn&#39;t turn up shit.  There is no damning evidence.  Just a few coincidences among a giant pile of out-of-context &quot;circumstantial evidence&quot;.  Most conspiracy theorists have moved on to pedophilia among elites with a wider scale than the PizzaGate nothingburger.  But for some people, Pizzagate is absolutely real and no amount of rational explanations can change their minds.</p>

<p>People not agreeing with you isn&#39;t because of &quot;shills&quot;.  It&#39;s because, sometimes, people don&#39;t agree with you.  Shills exist, but most people in this sub seem to go out of their way to explain the reality of pizzagate.  This sub, for the most part, seems to be over it.  There are bigger fish to fry.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes you&#39;ve figured it out bro, Pizzagate is a behemoth conspiracy invented by a handful of citizen journalists who have risked their safety, social lives, reputations etc so they can make money off youtube ad revenue and bumper stickers. All the evidence of elite pedophile rings protected by law enforcement and media is a sophisticated hoax. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah i mean it&#39;s not like it&#39;s been common knowledge for close to a decade that the internet is overrun by astroturfers, bots and paid commenters who work to promote a consensus in all kinds of topics. Comment sections in reddit is one of the most blatant examples of this on the internet. If you have a large scale business/organisation and aren&#39;t using these methods of PR in 2017 you are well and truly behind the curve.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I haven’t seen any evidence that Cum Panda is specifically in reference to kids, but if it is, and if that’s the context he’s using it in, yeah that’s fucked up. It seems more likely to me that’s not the context he’s using it in based on what’s in the pictures he’s posted with that hashtag. I could be wrong. That’s still not enough to call him a pedo in my mind, and to me it reeks of 4chan making something fit the result they were looking for. </p>
