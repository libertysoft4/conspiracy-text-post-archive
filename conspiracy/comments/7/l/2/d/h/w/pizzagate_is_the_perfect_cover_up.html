    <div class="md"><p>Heh...I&#39;ve seen this ridiculous talking point pop up a lot recently. Pgate isn&#39;t the cover for pedophiles, it <em>is</em> the pedophiles. And it spiraled into Pedogate, which is far broader in its scope and implications. What you are saying will, either intentionally or not, eventually smother any and all discussion of Pgate, by making it so that if we accept the <em>reality</em> that our politicians and celebrities are degenerate pieces of shit who abuse children, suddenly <em>we&#39;re</em> the pedophiles.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s some evidence to show you our politicians are <em>definitely</em> involved in this shit:</p>

<p>And I will point out that yesterday I was able to discredit a post on here about a huge pedobust that actually turned out to be Russian propaganda from 2014... </p>

<p>But I guess here is a new question, are they directly connected with pizzagate? Or do they act alone? </p>

<p>I guess I just see that the pizzagate thing as a gateway to pedophilia. </p>

<p>Showing people how pedophiles operate is like that one time the MSM was showing people how terrorist make pipe bombs. Sometimes too much exposure is just that, too much and it actually reproduces the problem in a way no one can predict.</p>

<p>Also I is impossible to find a single victim of the actual pizzagate scandal anywhere, how can there be evidence of a crime without a victim? What&#39;s the point of all this unless it&#39;s actually what I see it as, reproducing and normalizing pedophila </p>

<p>Exposing people to Pgate won&#39;t make them Pedophiles...that&#39;s not how this works. Pedophilia is a mental predisposition, it doesn&#39;t just &quot;happen&quot;, one is born with the condition and lives with it their entire life. </p>

<p>Pgate was always based on the emails, the instagram photos, the bands and their art at CPP. If you get to the root of it you understand why there are no victims to come forward...you don&#39;t survive this. You are raped, tortured, and murdered, all in the name of ritual magick. Pgate isn&#39;t the normalization of Pedophilia, it is the thread that leads to the unraveling of our entire Elites infatuation with it. </p>

<p>It is a mental disorder. You aren&#39;t challening me, you are literally challenging the APA and Modern Psychology- here&#39;s a few links-</p>

<p><a href="https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/features/explaining-pedophilia#1">https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/features/explaining-pedophilia#1</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/conditions/pedophilia">https://www.psychologytoday.com/conditions/pedophilia</a></p>

<p>And here&#39;s the actual APA DSMV definition- <a href="https://www.theravive.com/therapedia/pedophilic-disorder-dsm--5-302.2-(f65.4)">https://www.theravive.com/therapedia/pedophilic-disorder-dsm--5-302.2-(f65.4)</a></p>

<p>It&#39;s a mental disorder.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Our society is quit to discredit things that are not socially accepted as born traits.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But it is also quick to discredit the horrific abuse of children by adults who should know better and control their feelings. It&#39;s not something that should be protected- it is something that should be carefully rooted out and watched.</p>

<p>Because we aren&#39;t nearly as far into understanding our genes like that. Just last week they finally identified <em>some</em> of the genes associated with homosexuality- <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/2017/12/07/genes-linked-homosexuality-discovered-scientists/">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/2017/12/07/genes-linked-homosexuality-discovered-scientists/</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Psychology has its issues but there are some things it gets right- Schizophrenia is a mental issue, depression is a mental issue, pedophilia is a mental issue.

You can get away with this all day, for generations, as long as you make sure they&#39;re eliminated once their usefulness is gone. The doc I linked about the Franklin Scandal- Conspiracy of Silence- explains a lot of this at the end, like how they physically intimidated Paul Bonnaci into not testifying, and how the FBI forced him to recant his testimony and ensnare the other victim- Alicia Owens- who upon refusing to recant spent 25 fucking years in jail. And this was in the 80&#39;s! They&#39;re more careful now, they don&#39;t leave loose ends lying about anymore...I highly recommend you take an hour of your time and watch it.

<p>I didn&#39;t make you &quot;seem any less than me&quot;. I made an observation based on our discussion. You are skeptical of Pgate and its aims, as well as the systematized abuse perpetrated by our Politicians. It&#39;s a hard pill to swallow but the world definitely gets darker when one does. I&#39;m just having a friendly conversation, not belittling you. </p>

<p>I mean, you have my entire post and submission history to dig through if you want to question my intent. I&#39;m here in good faith and always have been. </p>

<p>Lol I never belittled you, I have been very kind and polite in this discussion. You are the one trying to turn this into something it is not, accusing me of being immature and attacking you, when I have done no such thing.

    <div class="md"><p>So you blame the people pointing out the heinous crime for committing the crime so the real criminals face no heat. Switching focus is a tactic used to do this. I stopped posting pizzagte stuff to facebook because of this. This tactic is effectively used to silence people since no one wants to even consider they&#39;d do the same fucked up shit much less be publicly accused of harboring those feeling internally. </p>

<p>And now that John Podesta is being trotted out to be rebranded as an Alien ufo guru or something, these types of posts are becoming more prevalent. It makes me wonder just how dumb they think most people are. You see the problem with Pizzagate isn&#39;t just that he may be molesting children, its that they may also be participating in cannibalism to ingest Adrenochrome, and when you start to knock on the door that is Pizzagate you realize that not just this conspiracy, but all of them run together to cover up for a lie that began long ago, much longer than we have publicly available written history for. </p>

<p>To be honest, I think you maybe a victim of gaslighting. Usually seen in abusive relationships it’s a form of control that rewrites what a person sees as the truth. I found myself, as I usually do, captivated and convinced through looking into this and was honestly just like wow how did I not see all of this, but I saw a random pic of the “murder room” at comet pizza and realized that this was all an elaborate control mechanism. </p>

<p>I encourage everyone to look up gaslighting, look at the signs and symptoms. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you blame the people pointing out the heinous crime for committing the crime so the real criminals face no heat. Switching focus is a tactic used to do this. I stopped posting pizzagte stuff to facebook because of this. This tactic is effectively used to silence people since no one wants to even consider they&#39;d do the same fucked up shit much less be publicly accused of harboring those feeling internally. </p>

<p>And now that John Podesta is being trotted out to be rebranded as an Alien ufo guru or something, these types of posts are becoming more prevalent. It makes me wonder just how dumb they think most people are. You see the problem with Pizzagate isn&#39;t just that he may be molesting children, its that they may also be participating in cannibalism to ingest Adrenochrome, and when you start to knock on the door that is Pizzagate you realize that not just this conspiracy, but all of them run together to cover up for a lie that began long ago, much longer than we have publicly available written history for. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t want to polorize anyone because you are correct, there are pedophiles in our government. </p>

<p>And I will point out that yesterday I was able to discredit a post on here about a huge pedobust that actually turned out to be Russian propaganda from 2014... </p>

<p>But I guess here is a new question, are they directly connected with pizzagate? Or do they act alone? </p>

<p>I guess I just see that the pizzagate thing as a gateway to pedophilia. </p>

<p>Showing people how pedophiles operate is like that one time the MSM was showing people how terrorist make pipe bombs. Sometimes too much exposure is just that, too much and it actually reproduces the problem in a way no one can predict.</p>

<p>Also I is impossible to find a single victim of the actual pizzagate scandal anywhere, how can there be evidence of a crime without a victim? What&#39;s the point of all this unless it&#39;s actually what I see it as, reproducing and normalizing pedophila </p>
