        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">28</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2017-12-21 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/That_Is_Precious.html">That_Is_Precious</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Politics aside, I wanted to explain why the &quot;coup&quot; narrative might not be bullcrap.   There are some questions that need to be asked.  </p>

<p>Note: I tried to find sources that would appeal to different users on this sub</p>

<p><strong>Why it could be a political coup:</strong></p>

<p>1. Within 24 hours of Hillary&#39;s loss, the Clinton campaign went into Russia-gate overdrive. It became a way to explain the defeat and a tactic to decrease the legitimacy of the current presidency:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/how-the-russia-spin-got-so-much-torque_us_5906e5f6e4b03b105b44ba15">https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/how-the-russia-spin-got-so-much-torque_us_5906e5f6e4b03b105b44ba15</a></p>

<p>2. It was evident that major news networks were actively helping Hillary Clinton before the election:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.snopes.com/donna-brazile-leaves-cnn/">https://www.snopes.com/donna-brazile-leaves-cnn/</a></p>

<p>I&#39;d be happy to post other evidence of the media&#39;s &quot;assistance&quot; with the Clinton campaign.</p>

<p>Many of these same media organizations are now delegitimizing the current presidency.</p>

<p>3. In the months leading up to the election, at least one Trump campaign official had their phone(s) tapped. This tap was accessed via a FISA warrant. The FISA warrant might have been obtained under extremely shady circumstances; shady circumstances paid for by the Clinton Camp.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/dec/20/christopher-steele-hedges-russia-dossier-claims-ag/">https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/dec/20/christopher-steele-hedges-russia-dossier-claims-ag/</a></p>

<p>4. It is becoming more likely that the people investigating Trump are adamantly against his presidency. It is possible that they orchestrated an &quot;insurance&quot; strategy (possible coup) in the event of a Trump presidency. The connections between a top FBI agent and his wife, an employee of Fusion GPS, are interesting.</p>

<p>Is a political coup occurring? I don&#39;t know at this point.</p>

<p>Is it becoming more likely that a political coup is occurring? I think that is the most interesting question.</p>

<p>Edit: The one question I will ask others... Are you downvoting this post because you disagree with the arguments, or are you downvoting this post because you disagree with the tough questions? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Manafort was working for Ukraine and Russian oligarchs since 2006, long before the Podesta Group. Manafort also worked for Dmytro Firtash, who is deeply connected to Semyon Mogilevich, the head of the Russian mafia. <em>Slight</em> difference between the two in terms of work done in Ukraine.</p>

<p>I also don&#39;t know why you are so worried if anyone colluded with Russia during the campaign. Trumps own legal council has already said collusion is not a crime. I take their word for it. Shit, even if the Trump Campaign Foreign Policy Teams main objective was to change the RNC platform on Ukraine with assistance from GRU officers and input from Oleg Deripaska, I don&#39;t know if that is really illegal. Just extremely unethical.</p>

<p>You also should know that collusion is not the only thing Mueller is looking into. Obstruction of justice looks like the biggest investigative target as of now, but I hope you are preparing for what happens when Mueller get his hands on people like Michael Cohen and Felix Sater. Mueller is going to want to know how  Trump Soho came to be and why there were so many Russian and Kazakh mafia figures involved at the top level of the development effort. </p>

But don&#39;t take my word for it, take a constitutional law professor from Harvard&#39;s word for it: <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-12-04/trump-can-t-confess-to-anything-in-a-tweet">https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-12-04/trump-can-t-confess-to-anything-in-a-tweet</a></p>

<p>You are correct on the second point. Obsessing over evil Russians plotting to take over our country while offering zero hard evidence of that very serious claim is the very definition of a new Cold War. Perhaps you are too young to remember the last one. The kind of irresponsible hysteria you are contributing to brought humanity to the brink during the Cuban Missile Crisis. </p>

<p>Even Obama&#39;s CIA chief has admitted that your Russian conspiracy theory has been thoroughly debunked: <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/clinton-ally-says-smoke-no-fire-no-russia-trump-collusion-n734176">https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/clinton-ally-says-smoke-no-fire-no-russia-trump-collusion-n734176</a></p>

<p>Every minute you spend obsessing about evil Russians is a minute we&#39;re not talking about the many, many horrible policies Trump and his GOP cronies are actually implementing, which effect the lives of every American. </p>

<p>Wake up from your fever-dream, turn off Rachel Maddow, and ask yourself who really benefits from diverting the public&#39;s attention from the reality of what&#39;s actually going on in this country. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mueller has more than Trumps tweet, which is obviously not written by Dowd. McGahn has provided research records on criminal statutes on lying to the fbi that he compiled after he had  discussions with Sally Yates. McGahn had already known about Flynn lying to the FBI and told Trump about it. Trump knew in late January  at least that Flynn lied to the FBI. </p>

<p>Are you going to address how Trump personally employed a convicted Russian mafia associate or no? Or maybe address all of the Russian and Kazakh mafia money that turned up in Trump Soho as a result of Felix Sater and Tevfik Arif&#39;s efforts?</p>

<p>Nothing has been debunked my friend. There is  nothing that has yet been provided to disprove the Trump Org links to Russian organized crime  through people like Felix Sater and Michael Cohen. </p>

<p>Digging into a presidents ties to Russian organized crime is not going to start a new cold war and it is honestly one of the most pathetic excuses to stop a criminal investigation that I have seen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you knew anything about law, you&#39;d realize that it&#39;s not what you know, it&#39;s what you can prove. Every legal expert worth his or her salt has admitted proving the obstruction case is virtually impossible here. But, hey, I guess you know more about it than a Harvard law professor and constitutional law scholar. Keep dreaming, buddy. Maybe if you click your heels together and wish real hard, your dream of a Mike Pence Presidency will come to fruition. What a wonderful world that would be.</p>

<p>Second, look at what your saying here. You started out talking about the Russians stealing the election, and now you are prattling on about some obscure supposed Russian crime figures. This is classic Russiagate goal-post moving. Frankly, what you&#39;re describing seems tame compared with the Clintons&#39; involvement with the Russians in the Uranium One debacle. </p>

<p>Our brothers and sisters struggling in Flint, Michigan, McDowell County, West Virginia, and all over American could care less about Felix Sater and Michael Cohen. They care about having clean water to drink, having a roof over their heads, and putting food on the table for their children. They care about the pain caused by Big Pharma&#39;s opioid pushing, massive structural unemployment and underemployment, they care about ending the disastrous foreign wars that are bankrupting our economy.</p>

<p>I never said the criminal investigation should be stopped. Just that the ridiculous, myopic focus on it and the hysteria being whipped up by people like you, and the mainstream news media, are an enormous disservice to our country and threaten humanity by dragging us into a new Cold War. This is objectively true. Just look at what is going on right now in Congress with this Committee dragging Jill Stein and comedian Randy Credico before it, for no other reason than they talked to people the political Establishment doesn&#39;t like (RT and WikiLeaks, respectively). This is textbook McCarthyism, and it is an assault on free speech that is happening right now, and you are a part of it, whether you admit it or not.</p>

<p>As an American who believes in the Constitution, that concerns me far more that Felix Sater or some Khazak guy I&#39;ve never heard of.</p>

<p>Exactly. If you can prove that:</p>

<ul>
<li>Trump pressured Comey to drop an investigation into Mike Flynn</li>
<li>Trump knew in advance of him pressuring Comey of Flynn lying to the FBI</li>
<li>Trump was warned by his own legal council in advance of Flynn&#39;s legal troubles</li>
<li>Trump wrote his intent before firing Comey into a non-public memo with help from Stephen Miller and his own council argued against that memo.</li>
</ul>

<p>Then it&#39;s pretty easy to prove obstruction of justice.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You started out talking about the Russians stealing the election. This is classic Russiagate goal-post moving. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nope. You are putting words in my mouth. I knew of Trump&#39;s involvement in Russian money laundering projects at the end of 2016. I&#39;ve been telling my own friends that support Trump that this investigation was eventually going to turn this up. I personally don&#39;t believe the Trump team colluded with Russian intelligence to influence the election. Sure they provided motive to the Russians by changing policy decisions on sanctions and Ukraine, but that&#39;s not really illegal. I know from my own research that Trump is deathly afraid about Mueller focusing on his organisation&#39;s finances.</p>

<p>In this entire thread, can you please find me where I <strong>&quot;started out talking about the Russians stealing the election&quot;</strong>. Cause I don&#39;t.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>now you are prattling on about some obscure supposed Russian crime figures</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Felix Sater was a Trump Org employee that was in close contact with Michael Cohen on project acquisition. The projects that Michael Cohen and Felix Sater were involved in are either entirely funded by Kazakh, Russian, and Azeri mafia figures. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/17/nyregion/17trump.html">Felix Sater was convicted of stabbing a man in the face and convicted of $40 million in stock fraud conspiracy</a>. Felix Sater was also a <a href="http://a.abcnews.com/images/Politics/abc_sater_card_lf_151130.jpg">Trump org employee</a>. Michael Cohen will have his story told in the press soon enough. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Maybe if you click your heels together and wish real hard, your dream of a Mike Pence Presidency will come to fruition.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lol, Pence is just as guilty as Trump with relation to obstruction of justice and Mike Flynn. He ran the transition. He knew everything that Flynn did, which is why Trump legal council is freaking out over the transition emails winding up at the Special Council&#39;s office.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You sound delusional. If any of those claims could be proven, Trump would already be indicted, and stalwart neoliberals like Michael Morrell and Dahlia Lithwick wouldn&#39;t be distancing themselves from the debunked Russiagate narrative. Even Masha Gessen, one of the most anti-Putin reporters out there, has disowned this debunked conspiracy theory: <a href="http://www.nybooks.com/daily/2017/03/06/trump-russia-conspiracy-trap/">http://www.nybooks.com/daily/2017/03/06/trump-russia-conspiracy-trap/</a></p>

<p>And let&#39;s assume you&#39;re right about Pence (despite the glaring fact you have offered no evidence). Then you must really be dreaming about a Paul Ryan Presidency, because he is next in line. What a wonderful world that would be, for the American oligarchs. </p>

<p>My comments regarding goal-post moving referred to Russiagate fanatics a whole (as in &quot;you Russiagaters&quot;). It always starts with election stealing, travels through obstruction, and when those arguments fail, you resort to vague accusations of money laundering from last decade. </p>

<p>Again, I could really care less about Michael Cohen and Felix Sater. The issues I raised in my last post are far more important to me because they effect the lives of every American. Those issues are what we should be focusing on, not corrupt dealings of some guy who was once Trump&#39;s lawyer on some construction project ten years ago. Again, even if true, that pales in comparison to Uranium One.</p>

<p>So, go ahead and click those heals, close your eyes and wish real hard, perhaps your dream of a world where Paul Ryan is Commander-in-Chief will come to pass. I have far more important               issues to spend my time on, like income inequality, the opioid crisis, net neutrality, and defending free speech. </p>
