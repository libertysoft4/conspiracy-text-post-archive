<p>“Estimative language consists of two elements: Judgements about the likelihood of developments or events occurring and levels of confidence in the sources and analytic reasoning supporting the judgements. <strong>Judgements are not intended to imply that we have proof that shows something to be fact</strong>. Assessments are based on collected information, which is often incomplete or fragmentary, as well as logic, argumentation and precedents.”</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s a huge factor who actually hacked the DNC and provided it to Wikileaks.  You can speculate all you like about how it went down, but it&#39;s not fact.  How hard would it be for the NSA to provide the facts/proof that would be needed to support that assessment?</p>

<p>ok, let&#39;s say that&#39;s accurate - explain how emails which the report itself said contained valid info &quot;meddled the election&quot; because they didn&#39;t really make that clear</p>

<p>(and btw saying something like &quot;well wikileaks didn&#39;t release info on Trump&quot; doesn&#39;t really make sense, because one had to seek out the info in the DNC emails &amp; it&#39;s not like there was any reporting on them in the mass media. There was plenty of pre-election info  about the Trump admin for people to find as well, and I&#39;m not talking about Russia)</p>

<p>i consider that neither solid nor obvious, and am interested to know why you do.</p>

<p>i think assange&#39;s life circmstances have made him willing to engage in <em>realpolitik</em> and thus engage in temporary alliances with people to his own benefit, as evidenced by his qualified support of president trump over hillary clinton during the 2016 general election i have yet to see any evidence that vladimir putin is one of those people, but would love it if someone pushing the &quot;russia! wikileaks!&quot; angle were able to produce something substantive and compelling.</p>

<p>for now, i have resigned myself to continuing to be bored by this narrative and disappointed in the people pushing it.</p>

A lot of it is laughable at time, especially when you consider Trump (Cambridge Analytics) &amp; Clinton (CTR) were both paying millions for social media manipulation.

<p>He has a rabid fan base and a fairly popular subreddit on this site.  You&#39;re not even debating my point, you just grabbed the fact that donald isn&#39;t on the front page all the time any more. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because it isn&#39;t and you said it was. I&#39;m not denying anything above - you&#39;re jist trying to move your shitty goalposts and make it look like you&#39;re in a better position than you actually are.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And whether or not leftist shit hits the front page all the time, which it does, pro-Hillary Clinton stuff never does. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why would it? She&#39;s a nobody now sipping tea in Chappequa making sure her BleachBit receipts are shredded.  Again - another point that is irrelevant.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There&#39;s never a Hillary Clinton did this great thing, isn&#39;t she great, post on the front page.  Fuck, they call Trump a godking emperor.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Who cares what a sub calls him? The rest of the site calls him Mango Mussolini. As far as I&#39;m concerned the whole lot is out of their minds.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m not even defending HRC because I don&#39;t like her, I want her to stay out of politics for the rest of her life for the good of the country, but I have no idea why you&#39;re calling me a liar unless name calling is all you have.</p>

<p>Because you did. You even backtracked in this reply to admit that <a href="/r/The_Donald">/r/The_Donald</a> <strong>doesn&#39;t</strong> show up all the time on <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hmm, interesting read. I&#39;m not sure who the mystery 17th US intelligence agency is, op, or why US Coast Guard intelligence really needs to chime in on this matter, but maybe we should wait until we hear what the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency has to say about things before we do anything more... You quote the appendix/&quot;disclaimer&quot; from the report that states that judgements are not intended to say they have proof. Ok. But, they also don&#39;t say that they don&#39;t have proof. Groups like these tend to hold their cards close. They do offer in the report that they assess that the GRU did hack into the DNC networks and that they did releases the information obtained through Wikileaks. I guess it comes down to if you trust the assessment of these intelligence agencies or of you think they are lying. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They aren&#39;t even investigating the hack with relation to Trump.  It&#39;s also pretty clear the NSA could easily produce the data that proves the DNC was hacked, but have chosen not to.  Maybe they&#39;re just putting out reports based on opinion and deciding to hold off on producing the actual data to back it up.  I mean, it&#39;s not like the Intelligence Agencies have ever lied to the american people before.</p>
