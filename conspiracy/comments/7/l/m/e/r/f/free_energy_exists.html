        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Did you know that there is no money in free energy?</p>

<p>Its true. </p>

<p>I am here today, truthfully and astoundingly, typing next to a device that makes clean energy and does so for periods of time that are unknown. It could be a year, it could be millennia. The things I am powering with it are more likely to quit working before the power source does.</p>

<p>And guess what... I am not getting any richer.</p>

<p>Why? Well for one reason, the majority of people simply do not believe free, unlimited clean energy is possible.</p>

<p>The majority of people cling to the idea that we have all been indoctrinated into believing. </p>

<p>That this type of technology is only available in comic books and movies... Iron man, Star Wars, etc.</p>

<p>We are all led to believe that burning black rocks and black goo that is poisonous to our bodies is absolutely the best way to create energy.</p>

<p>But in reality, our Earth provides us with enough energy for all of humanity WITHOUT burning poison and releasing it into our air so that we can inhale our wonderful concoction of indoctrination.</p>

<p>Crystals are the answer.</p>

<p>Have you ever heard of a crystal radio? </p>

<p>It does not require any power source to operate, and one may listen to radio frequencies of your choice through an earpiece. </p>

<p>It receives all the energy it needs through the radio waves it tunes in on.</p>

<p>So I wonder where Nikolai Tesla got his idea for a system to send electricity wirelessly?</p>

<p>Of course I would just like to remind you that this idea was thought up in the 1800s. THE EIGHTEEN-HUNDREDS.</p>

<p>Its now 2017 and inventors these days are putting <a href="https://i.imgur.com/itqWp9c.jpg">Ipads on baby training toilets</a></p>

<p>We are being dumbed down.</p>

<p>It may seem like technology has become more advanced, but has it really? Does a bigger flatter TV that beams more photons into your eyeballs really mean technology is better than it was almost 100 years ago? TVs do the same thing now as they did back then.</p>

<p>(yes the world renowned TELL-YOU-VISION is about 90 years old now.)</p>

<p>Anyways I digress.</p>

<p>Crystals have an electrical output.</p>

<p>Try it if you don&#39;t believe me. Buy some epsom salt for 2.99 or whatever it is near you. Then heat up a half cup of water. Pour it into a container that can fit in your fridge. Then mix in a half cup of epsom salt. Mix it well, and let it sit in your fridge for a few hours, or overnight, or whatever the heck you want, just wait until some crystals form. Then grab a crystal, wrap some copper wire on it, then stick one lead of a multimeter on the copper wire and the other on the crystal.</p>

<p>Woah! Hey! There is electrical output! </p>

<p>Where is that energy coming from?</p>

<p>Honestly I am not sure. I doubt any of us regular folk really know for sure. Mostly because for the last few hundred years we have been slowly but surely led into stupidity by the governments of the world.</p>

<p>Yes, yes I know, such a huge conspiracy cannot possibly exist because someone would have spoken out by now blah blah blah.</p>

<p>Dont kid yourself. People have been speaking out about this for a long time and the fact is ... no one wants to listen. </p>

<p>Thats the truth and you know it.</p>

<p>So anyways, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YW0wjYdUPw&amp;amp;list=LLuE5ubtMhD8gABqfcek1uKw&amp;amp;index=2">here is a quick video from 1958 about crystals</a></p>

<p>Watch it, its very informative.</p>

<p>Everything that is solid in our world is actually a crystal.</p>

<p>Anything that has a shape or a structure, is formed by them.</p>

<p>So is it really that surprising crystals are the key to clean, free energy?</p>

<p>If you find this intriguing, I urge you to research John K Hutchisons crystal power cells. I am actually unsure wether or not he created them on his own, or if there are others that should be getting credit as well, but he seems very knowledgeable about them, as crazy as he is now a days. </p>

<p>I made my cells in an afternoon, using 99 cent half inch copper pipe end caps and some machine bolts I had laying around.</p>

<p>I mixed one tablespoon each of epsom salts, borax, alum, and potassium chloride together and ground them into a very fine powder, poured it into the copper end cap, heated it on a hot plate, and once it liquified, I placed in the machine bolt, with the head on the bottom and let it cool.</p>

<p>Also, prior to filling the copper end cap with the mixture I cut out a piece of engine gasket material into a circle and placed it on the inside of the copper pipe cap at the bottom to make sure the bolt did not touch the copper. That is an imperative step in order to ensure there are no short circuits, or else the cell will not produce any electricity.</p>

<p>After the cell cools, test it with a multimeter! Wait until it is nice and solid. There will be an electrical charge.</p>

<p>Make some more. Connect them in parallel and series! Power some stuff with it. Its a lot of fun.</p>

<p>However keep in mind, that although these cells are rumored to never run out of electricity, they are not magic. If you hook them up to something that draws more than it creates, it will run down, and stop powering whatever it is you are trying to power.</p>

<p>But if you unplug them, they will regain their charge after a period of time.</p>

<p>Effectively making them a self charging battery.</p>

<p>The key to unlimited perpetual energy is to find a balance between what the cells are producing and what you are powering. </p>

<p>If you are powering something that consumes less energy than the cells are producing, then bam, you have tapped an unlimited power source. </p>

<p>At the current moment, my cells are not creating much amperage. I can only power four white LEDs indefinitely.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzq_qWIhamQ">Here is a video that walks you through the process of creating these cells</a></p>

<p>Although this guy uses much larger copper caps, and a magnesium rod instead of any old metal bolt.</p>

<p>Different cell materials, cell sizes, mixture proportions, mixture materials and a multitude of other variables all come in to play when calculating what kind of power these cells produce.</p>

<p>This is not exactly the kind of technology that you can walk down to your local library and read up on the best way to create them.</p>

<p>I think this is technology has been in the hands of the people involved in what we call &quot;organized government&quot; for a looooong time.</p>

<p>We are all living in a self defeating slavery system in which we destroy homes, our bodies, and our lives because we are told to do so.</p>

<p>&quot;Burn that coal, build that radioactive power station, spend a zillion dollars on wind and solar!&quot; - Your government</p>

<p>So I will continue to spread my knowledge of the truth, and meanwhile I am sure there will be plenty of silly comments on here about how these crystal cells are fake, or that they are nothing more than a regular galvanic battery, and how its all a hoax.</p>

<p>But while those comments are being typed, my little cells will being pumping out voltage and amperage, day after day, year after year, without any gas or coal or wind or sun. Little crystal cells, easily stored underground, easily wired into a grid, easily accessible to homes up and down your street, in order to power your radios and TVs so you can listen to the government tell you that there is an energy crisis, and there are oil wars, and that your taxes went up and that you need to pay for their services.</p>

<p>Free Energy Exists.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is actually hilarious. Thanks for the laugh dude. It&#39;s really fascinating that a guy can build a simple electrochemical cell, only capable of powering a 2 watt bulb, and believe he has broken the third law of thermodynamics.</p>

<p>What&#39;s more disappointing is that hundreds of people actually believe you. I hope you understand that finding a way of counteracting entropy would be the greatest achievement in human history, by a long shot. Are you really arrogant enough to believe that you have done it yourself with copper wiring and a cell you shoddily crafted?</p>

<p>Jesus Christ dude. I&#39;d love to see you attempt to power a TV with that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Glad someone else is sane. A cursory understanding of Physics proves all of this is total bullshit.</p>

<p>Newsflash, OP, you&#39;re not in a closed thermodynamic system. The Earth regularly gets a tremendous amount of energy and radiation from, namely, <em>the fucking Sun</em>.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t have the time to break down your entire rambling mess, but I can just address the first point that got you off and running.</p>

<p>A crystal radio is powered from radio waves. Yeah, so, it takes energy from radiation. That&#39;s not <em>free</em> energy. That radio wave is generated by another source, whether it&#39;s natural or artificial. But the major point here is that <strong>something had to fucking generate that wave</strong>. And whatever generated that wave used energy.</p>

<p>If you actually took a high school chemistry class, you would be aware that all elements and compounds can be manipulated to become a solid, gas vapour, and sometimes many more in between. This can be done by manipulating temperature and pressure. I hope this spells out why a statement like &quot;all solids are crystals&quot; is just dumb. No, they&#39;re not.</p>

<p>Early in our scientific advancement, there was more room to &quot;explore&quot; all possible avenues of a Scientific Law through forming Hypothesis and creating Experiments that created Empirical Data until we experimented enough where we got conclusive applicable results that explained said phenomenon; which is a Theory. </p>

<p>Thermodynamics is a Scientific Law. What OP is saying is not that the Theory, Hypothesis, Empirical Data, or Experiments regarding Energy are wrong or have been hijacked, but the very observable nature of the world itself is wrong.</p>

<p>What you are saying is Science was great in the Renaissance because humans observed Scientific Law, and then had the wide berth and un-pioneered path ahead of them to look at many Hypotheses, Experiments, gather Empirical Data, and then form a Theory, because none of which existed. </p>

<p>Yes a Theory can be overturned in the future, and that is fine, in-fact, that is good Science! And I think this is what you are alluding too. Trying new ways to explain something just to try it, even if it goes against conventional wisdom and the consensus of truth. And it does happen, ALL THE TIME.</p>

<p>What OP is saying is that the Scientific Law is incorrect, not the Theory.</p>

<p>To circle back to the beginning of my comment, a Scientific Law is just an observation of reality that is true every time, no matter what. </p>

<p>A Hypothesis is a limited explanation of why that Scientific Law occurs in the natural world. </p>

<p>An Experiment is conducted based off that Hypothesis, and through which, Empirical Data is collected, which eventually either force the Hypothesis to be adjusted, chucked out the window or verified.</p>

<p>Once enough Empirical Data is collected, and it is seen that the Empirical Data from multiple different Hypothesis that explain DIFFERENT THINGS can all be explained by one axiom, that is a Theory. </p>

<p>They don&#39;t graduate from one to another, Prediction-&gt;Hypothesis-&gt;Theory-&gt;Law like most people are taught in school. They are all separate parts of the Scientific Method, which all try to Explain the Scientific Law, which is not an explanation, but just a undeniable observation of how the world works, and a Theory is really just a higher order Hypothesis that connects multiple other Hypothesis together, until something comes along and proves it otherwise.</p>

<p>So again, saying that &quot;Free Energy&quot; does exist is saying the Scientific Law is wrong, which is pretty hard to do because, again, a Scientific Law is an undeniable and verifiable observation of our natural world. The Theories that explain Thermodynamics can change, but not the Law of Thermodynamics.</p>

<p>This is why Gravity is a Theory and not a Law, because its observable, undeniable, and verifiable, but we only have a Theory to EXPLAIN how it works. OP is not trying to explain how &quot;Free Energy&quot; could exist, he is saying that is does and it is a Scientific Law, we just don&#39;t have a Theory for it yet...</p>

<p>Which is kinda like me saying Ghost are Scientific Law, I just have no Theory explaining them yet, or a Hypothesis of why I perhaps did see one. But I have an Experiment that shows one on a projector screen, saying &quot;look, see, its a ghost, and you can replicate this too in your own experiments at home!&quot;</p>

<p>But when the accepted Theory is presented to me that explains that the projected imagine is just that, a projection, and not an actual Ghost, I just say, &quot;well, The Law is Wrong!&quot;  </p>

The burden of proof is on the one who makes the claims (aka Newton), but the pseudo proof has already been tested for hundreds of years. If you wish to participate in the scientific community- that is great. If you do, you should subject yourself to high standards and understand the well explored and documented principles that we use today. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Piezoelectric is actually used somewhat in technology these days but only for tiny applications like clocks and sensors. It&#39;d be interesting to see if it could be used at a larger scale.</p>

<p>Tesla allegedly found a way to collect energy from the atmosphere and use it. I think it ties into how those plasma globes work but in reverse. The idea is that solar radiation is constantly flowing through our atmosphere so there is always electromagnetic energy at the surface too. If you create a point of high voltage on Earth this energy will accumulate to that point. The earth acts as a sort of battery for this energy, hence the magnetosphere. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I actually really like this idea. It has a ton of ground to cover before being capable of powering anything though. First of all, the guy in the video either misunderstands power, or doesn&#39;t want to point out the gaping hole in the system. Power is not a product of converting volts to watts as time passes like joules do. Unit analysis states that power is amps*volts. The fact that this guy misrepresents the basic unit of power is a reason to take what he says with a grain of salt. He likely does but this because, while his voltage values are impressive, as you increase in altitude and voltage, the atmospheric density decreases, along with the current. Since we have high voltage but low amperes, your power output won&#39;t be competitive.</p>

<p>Beyond that, he is clearly trying to cash out on this idea by making a quick buck. Graphene is not the most fascinating modern materials. Carbon nanotubes are literally changing the way we understand phases. This was a big topic of discussion when I took my first fluids class. If you actually wanna do some reading on cutting edge science- read about what happens when water is put inside these nanotubes. Like stated before, pressure and temperature can control the phase of a solid. We can predict what phase a compound will be at a set T and P very precisely. However, for some reason, inside a nanotube, water freezes when it should be boiling. We have no idea why as of yet. By utilizing this, we can potentially make the best conductors in history.</p>

<p>You have free (and, honestly, ridiculously easy) access to thousands of sources that would have taught you exactly how crystal radios work. Yet you&#39;ve read none of them. The only person dumbing you down is you. I learned how crystal radios work when I was 9. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, radio waves are a form of electromagnetic energy. The sound is created by alternating the energy levels.</p>

<p>So let&#39;s say you want to move something elastic, maybe the band of a slingshot, by a certain amount. You pull it with your fingers and stretch it. YOU are the energy source here. That energy is carried from your muscles to the band.</p>

<p>Similarly, the radio tower is the energy source for the audio information. The energy is carried by the electromagnetic waves, radio waves. Just like you pull the elastic band of the slingshot with your hand, the electromagnetic waves pull the little speakers of your headphones.</p>

<p>But the energy to pull the speakers itself is still coming from the radio tower. It is not created out of nothing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude what are you defining as “free energy”? </p>

<p>Free energy refers to perfect creation/conversion of mass to energy without losing anything to entropy. This is not free energy as you are still losing mass. The mass lost is just so small you can’t notice it because there’s such a small amount of energy being released. </p>

<p>If somehow this was scaled up to create the energy needed to power modern life, it would deplete just as fast as any other energy source we currently use. </p>

<p>But if what you are doing you consider “free energy” I don’t see it as any different than nuclear power. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You say spending zillions on solar: solar is getting much cheaper and tangible- and as long as our sun burns it will give us free energy as we perfect the means to harness it.
You yourself have invested more in supplies than makes sense to power a few small LEDs, and admit that the proper materials cost more money, and better results will come with more research and experimentation into the combinations/proportions of said materials. For now you&#39;ve built maybe the world&#39;s most expensive, overly complicated tea light, and I&#39;m not trying to insult you.</p>

<p>(Granted even the sun&#39;s light is not infinite, and comes with cost- but the fact is we&#39;re bombarded with it daily without having to work for it, so it&#39;s &#39;free&#39; to us in our/it&#39;s lifetime) </p>

<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong, I think you&#39;re onto something- I just think you&#39;re not giving solar research the same respect you feel the crystal research deserves.</p>

<p>Besides, when the sun dies, no amount of buried crystal batteries powering a few LEDs will help us.</p>

<p>Beyond all that, I&#39;m not sure what the collage of anti-education, technophobic imagery has to do with what you&#39;re saying- which is attempting to educate us on technology. For what it&#39;s worth, yeah- giving babies iPads is bad.</p>

<p>15 <a href="http://data.energizer.com/pdfs/e91.pdf">Energizer E91 AA batteries</a>, connected in parallel, will supply about 45,000 mAH of power at 25 mA draw. That equates to around 75 days of continuous output.</p>

<p>To properly judge your device, we need to know what current is being drawn by those LEDs. If they are drawing around 25 mA but remain lit for longer than 75 days, then congratulations, you&#39;ve made a battery that lasts longer than a good quality AA battery.</p>

<p>However, even if they last for 750 days, you have not created a &quot;free energy&quot; device. Try using one of these batteries to power the hot plate used to make them. If you can&#39;t then all you have done is use some of the heat energy from the hot plate to &quot;charge&quot; a dry cell battery.</p>

<p>If it takes more energy to make the battery than the battery can produce, you have lost energy. Therefore, it is <em>not</em> free energy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am fairly sure the idea of aliens from other worlds in space was implanted by those who wished to one day seize control of the free people of Earth through a puppet invasion of a fake new species. Propagating the idea of existence of life on other worlds also eases the knowledge that our current ways of life which destroy the Earth by poisoning the air and soil with dangerous chemicals, radiation, and carcinogens will one day not be a concern, for we can simply move to another spinning ball in space if we totally ruin this one.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reposting from another user</p>

<blockquote>
<p>1) They tell us for decades there&#39;s nothing to UFOs it&#39;s all made up or swamp gas or whatever.</p>

<p>2) The Dept of Defense then comes out and says, &quot;Not only are UFOs real, we&#39;ve been studying them. Oh yeah and here&#39;s some official videos captured by our F-16 jets.&quot;</p>

<p>Analysis of the videos is quite interesting because: 1) The UFO is flying up wind</p>

<p>2) The pilot says &quot;Look there&#39;s a whole fleet of them&quot;</p>

<p>3) It&#39;s an infrared camera but you can&#39;t see any exhaust jets nor can you see any downwash from a helicopter rotor. So how is it getting thrust? Don&#39;t know.</p>

<p>4) It&#39;s starts to rotate then stops, then rotates some more all while &quot;flying&quot;. I put flying in quotes because of the next point.</p>

<p>5) There are no visible flight surfaces, like wings, to give it lift. But it&#39;s at 25,000 feet up so how is it maintaining altitude.</p>

<p>6) Back to the rotation, this is not something we see any known aircraft on planet earth do. They (the DOD) know the inventory of every government on earth and this doesn&#39;t match any of them. They never come out and say it&#39;s aliens or an ET craft but one has to wonder where it fucking comes from.</p>

<p>7) It speeds up and slows down in ways that you can&#39;t really see on the vids but there have been engineers studying the video and they say that it stops so quickly that it&#39;s equivalent to something like a 280g stop, then starts up again with the same level of g force and seems unaffected by it.</p>

<p>NOW if that isn&#39;t enough....</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t some whistleblower where no officials will confirm what&#39;s being said. No this is an official Department of Defense release directly to main stream media, with video, names of the pilots and chain of custody records for the films (so everyone else in the govt can double check if it&#39;s possibly hoaxed) AND you have a Senator Harry Reid confirming that he was involved in getting this funded. ALL of that shit....has never happened before.</p>

<p>There&#39;s more video because these clips were tied to in incident that was recorded over many hours (IIRC it was like 4 hours or something), by many pilots and the aircraft carrier Nimitz. There are reports that the craft was hovering then shot up to 25,000 feet then came back down to within 18&quot; of the ocean and just hovered again....and it did all that in a matter of seconds. Nothing we know of does that.</p>

<p>Oh and there&#39;s the cryptic reference to some material that they don&#39;t know what it is, being housed in some warehouse that was converted to study it. But that&#39;s all it says.....so no one knows what the fuck that&#39;s all about, where it came from, what it can do or any of that.</p>

<p>Tom DeLonge has said that this first dump was simply one of 20 that will be coming very soon.</p>

<p>Exciting times</p>

<p>The head of the the program has said &quot;&quot;These aircraft -- we&#39;ll call them aircraft -- are displaying characteristics that are not currently within the US inventory nor in any foreign inventory that we are aware of,&quot;  &quot;Things that don&#39;t have any obvious flight services, any obvious forms of propulsion, and maneuvering in ways that include extreme maneuverability beyond, I would submit, the healthy G-forces of a human or anything biological,&quot;. My personal belief is that there is very compelling evidence that we may not be alone,&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While the incident is mysterious, it is pretty plainly not a hoax. The Department of Defense has released video of the unidentified object. The USS Princeton observed the UFO on radar, and six Super Hornets—twelve pilots and weapons system operators—saw the objects. (According to FighterSweep.com, which published an account of the incident in 2015, a seventh aircraft, a Marine F/A-18 was also involved.)</p>

<p>Doesn&#39;t matter which side you choose, I think OP is one of the above, or some combination of all 3, but this is why we have a mocking subreddit of r/TopMindsOfReddit. </p>

<p>In the end, we fight each other over negative evidence, which promotes an echo chamber. OP showed a few links that don&#39;t really show much other than some armature speculation. He is also a flat-Earther.</p>

<p>It also seems he does not understand scale or e=mc2. Some crystals or even a potato can power something, but that mass or energy is not &quot;created&quot;. Show me the math otherwise and we can go from there, but a few random links and a pic of his &quot;experiment&quot; is not science, or even a worthy speculation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for finally being explicit. I really honestly believe that Reddit needs more of it, because things just do get lost in translation. Dont you want to be understood better? Maybe you just didnt understand, that my intention was to understand lol. But you spent so much energy on not being explicit, and then did it anyways after. So I just think, it is best to be clear up front. Of course we are all at our own place in attaining this maxim- this ideal that I speak of. Ok sorry for putting you on the spot.

<p>The above phrase indicates that, of what I said people may have thought, you didn&#39;t say those things, which is hopefully, synonymous with, &quot;I didn&#39;t mean it that way.&quot;</p>

<p>So it seems you didn&#39;t mean it that way. I can&#39;t believe I actually have to ask, but you are forcing me by not being clear. Did you mean it that way? Did you mean your comment as a general attack on this sub? Isn&#39;t your opinion that this sub sucks?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’m going to assume that the reason this functions is because it is a magnesium cell. Unfortunately I don’t know what epsom salt is exactly - it’s magnesium sulfate, and anhydrous salt would provide the most magnesium, but odds are good it’s a hydrated salt, and if you pulled it out of your bathroom or something odds are very good it’s sucked moisture out of the air over time. Plus you said to make a paste with tap water so I really don’t know.</p>

<p>But I can give you a ballpark estimate.</p>

<p>So first we need to know the electrical load. You’re running four white LEDs which typically use about 10mA each. Are they as bright as you’d normally expect or somewhat dim? I’ll use Fermi estimation and say all four are drawing a combined 10mA. Voltage doesn’t really matter here. Nernst equation says it will decrease as the cell is used but the cell should be very close to dead by the time it drops below an LED’s required voltage.</p>

<p>Next, we need to know just how much charge your cells can move through the LEDs. A tablespoon of epsom salt, which your used in your powder, is 15mL. I mentioned why I would have to estimate before because I really don’t know how much is there. Wikipedia lists a lot of densities, depending on the water in the salt, around 2g/mL when solid. So we can say there are about 30g of magnesium sulfate in that tablespoon. Molar masses depend on the water content - it’s the molar mass of magnesium sulfate plus some number of water molecules - but they’re about 150g/mol. Now we get 0.2 moles of magesium sulfate and by extension magnesium in a tablespoon. Magnesium<sup>2+</sup> ion will probably be reduced to magnesium metal, a reaction involving two electrons in the cell, so 0.4 moles of electrons may move. Let’s say between 0.1 and 1 moles of electrons.</p>

<p>The charge of an electron is defined as -1.6*10<sup>-19</sup> coulombs; it is the elementary charge. A mole of electrons is 6.022*10<sup>23</sup> (Avogadro’s number - it’s not really any different than a dozen or a score of something, just intended to be used with atomic scale things) of them. Faraday’s constant gives us a conversion factor: a mole of electrons has a charge of -96485C. Therefore your cell can spit out between 10000C and 100000C worth of charge.</p>

<p>Instead of saying 10mA we can say 10mC/s (milli-coulombs per second, charge over time) equals 0.01C/s (coulombs per second, just divide by 1000 and drop the milli) and convert:</p>

<p>10000C/(0.01C/s) = 1,000,000 seconds ~= 10 days</p>

<p>100000C/(0.01C/s) = 10,000,000 seconds ~= 100 days</p>

<p>Converting those gives you life times on the order of a week to a season. My prediction is that, with such a small load, your setup will last about a month.</p>

<p>That’s a long time, but that isn’t forever, and it isn’t free. You’ll meed a larger amount of energy to drive the electrochemical reaction in the  opposite direction to recharge the cell. But get back to us on this. Electrochemistry is such a neat field and I genuinely want to hear the results.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you have an electrochemical reaction going on, thus forming more salt crystals.  It certainly wouldn&#39;t last forever.  Is it eating up your copper shell, or depositing onto it?  Nonetheless, you&#39;re not getting more salt crystals from nowhere.</p>

<p>The refining of  metals is a highly electric intensive process.  In a sense what you&#39;re doing is storing electricity when you refine the metals, then releasing that stored electricity as you let the metal corrode.</p>

<p>As far as filling a room with dry cell batteries to supply the power for your house.  Sure, you can do it.  Buying a couple of tons of copper, magnesium, and the other required salts won&#39;t be cheap.</p>

<p>Are you fucking kidding me?  </p>

<p>I build my free energy plant. I supply a terawatt of free energy to the grid. I undercut the regular suppliers by 80%. The power distributors beat a path to my door. I keep the secret to myself while building more power plants until I have the whole market to myself. Distributors make more money, customers get some of the savings passed on to them, I become crazy rich and spend the rest of my life surrounded by porn models. In my will I leave the secret to humanity so they will put up statues to me, make biopics about me, and discreetly ignore the part about the porn models. Literally not seeing a downside here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reposting from another user</p>

<blockquote>
<p>1) They tell us for decades there&#39;s nothing to UFOs it&#39;s all made up or swamp gas or whatever.</p>

<p>2) The Dept of Defense then comes out and says, &quot;Not only are UFOs real, we&#39;ve been studying them. Oh yeah and here&#39;s some official videos captured by our F-16 jets.&quot;</p>

<p>Analysis of the videos is quite interesting because: 1) The UFO is flying up wind</p>

<p>2) The pilot says &quot;Look there&#39;s a whole fleet of them&quot;</p>

<p>3) It&#39;s an infrared camera but you can&#39;t see any exhaust jets nor can you see any downwash from a helicopter rotor. So how is it getting thrust? Don&#39;t know.</p>

<p>4) It&#39;s starts to rotate then stops, then rotates some more all while &quot;flying&quot;. I put flying in quotes because of the next point.</p>

<p>5) There are no visible flight surfaces, like wings, to give it lift. But it&#39;s at 25,000 feet up so how is it maintaining altitude.</p>

<p>6) Back to the rotation, this is not something we see any known aircraft on planet earth do. They (the DOD) know the inventory of every government on earth and this doesn&#39;t match any of them. They never come out and say it&#39;s aliens or an ET craft but one has to wonder where it fucking comes from.</p>

<p>7) It speeds up and slows down in ways that you can&#39;t really see on the vids but there have been engineers studying the video and they say that it stops so quickly that it&#39;s equivalent to something like a 280g stop, then starts up again with the same level of g force and seems unaffected by it.</p>

<p>NOW if that isn&#39;t enough....</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t some whistleblower where no officials will confirm what&#39;s being said. No this is an official Department of Defense release directly to main stream media, with video, names of the pilots and chain of custody records for the films (so everyone else in the govt can double check if it&#39;s possibly hoaxed) AND you have a Senator Harry Reid confirming that he was involved in getting this funded. ALL of that shit....has never happened before.</p>

<p>There&#39;s more video because these clips were tied to in incident that was recorded over many hours (IIRC it was like 4 hours or something), by many pilots and the aircraft carrier Nimitz. There are reports that the craft was hovering then shot up to 25,000 feet then came back down to within 18&quot; of the ocean and just hovered again....and it did all that in a matter of seconds. Nothing we know of does that.</p>

<p>Oh and there&#39;s the cryptic reference to some material that they don&#39;t know what it is, being housed in some warehouse that was converted to study it. But that&#39;s all it says.....so no one knows what the fuck that&#39;s all about, where it came from, what it can do or any of that.</p>

<p>Tom DeLonge has said that this first dump was simply one of 20 that will be coming very soon.</p>

<p>Exciting times</p>

<p>The head of the the program has said &quot;&quot;These aircraft -- we&#39;ll call them aircraft -- are displaying characteristics that are not currently within the US inventory nor in any foreign inventory that we are aware of,&quot;  &quot;Things that don&#39;t have any obvious flight services, any obvious forms of propulsion, and maneuvering in ways that include extreme maneuverability beyond, I would submit, the healthy G-forces of a human or anything biological,&quot;. My personal belief is that there is very compelling evidence that we may not be alone,&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While the incident is mysterious, it is pretty plainly not a hoax. The Department of Defense has released video of the unidentified object. The USS Princeton observed the UFO on radar, and six Super Hornets—twelve pilots and weapons system operators—saw the objects. (According to FighterSweep.com, which published an account of the incident in 2015, a seventh aircraft, a Marine F/A-18 was also involved.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, radio waves are a form of electromagnetic energy. The sound is created by alternating the energy levels.</p>

<p>So let&#39;s say you want to move something elastic, maybe the band of a slingshot, by a certain amount. You pull it with your fingers and stretch it. YOU are the energy source here. That energy is carried from your muscles to the band.</p>

<p>Similarly, the radio tower is the energy source for the audio information. The energy is carried by the electromagnetic waves, radio waves. Just like you pull the elastic band of the slingshot with your hand, the electromagnetic waves pull the little speakers of your headphones.</p>

<p>But the energy to pull the speakers itself is still coming from the radio tower. It is not created out of nothing.</p>
