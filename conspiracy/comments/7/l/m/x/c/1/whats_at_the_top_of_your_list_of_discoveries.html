    <div class="md"><p>OP mentions DMT. The pyramids are clearly initatiatory chambers where the initiates where first given something like it, then &quot;died and was reborn&quot; into the mysteries - the building is designed to amplify the experience. The Pharaohs were priest-kings - the priesthood was the most powerful institution in Egypt - they erected and used the pyramids for their purposes. No king would have the influence to build something like that over those time-spans, far longer than any kings reign. The priesthood survived for millennia. Moses was a part of the egyptian royal family and tripped inside the pyramids btw, perhaps there is evidence of that in the recently discovered gap/room inside the great pyramid.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Pyramids and other stone megastructures throughout the world that are much older than the accepted civilizational timeline.  Nothing gave me such a strong feeling that our entire accepted worldview is just wrong if the foundational history we learn is a lie.  It really brings to mind Orwell&#39;s &quot;He who controls the past controls the future. He who controls the present controls the past.&quot;  I think our ancient history is known by some, and suppressed.  Makes me wonder to what end?</p>

<p>And confirming why Pence flew under the radar to Pakistan this morning <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7lgf6f/pence_pays_surprise_visit_to/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7lgf6f/pence_pays_surprise_visit_to/</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Unironically, no memes, no holocaust denial, but jews. </p>

<p>All of one of my school years was dedicated to the holocaust. History, english, and portions of other classes, and other projects and trips, all holocaust. Nobody ever told us of the german revolution of 1919, a huge shit in germany perpetrated by communist jews. Makes sense why the germans had such a hardon of commies and jews. It obviously doesn&#39;t justify the holocaust, but they told us the entirety of germany was all about rounding up  the jews, just cuz. Just for the cuz of it. Not maybe they were angry about the whole bloody revolution carried out by communist jews that fucked over tons of other germans. And of course spend the whole year on the poor jews not like tens of millions of non jews and soldiers died and lots of other shit happened. No. WWII = Jews. I learned about actual WWII and about the revolution  on my own and it made the german compliance with the holocaust make a lot more sense. </p>

<p>And of course you got your rothschilds and bildebergs and your steins and blats and golds etc etc. All up to shit. I don&#39;t believe in a bunch of anti-semetic shit and weird anti-jew conspiracies, and i don&#39;t think it has anything to do with race or eugenics or any of that shit, I think jews are just like &quot;hey my fellow jew lets do some shit&quot;. Jews are up to some shit for real. </p>

<p>Also Israel is a bunch of fuckin jerks. Also I saw a live action JIDF shit go down in a front page reddit thread. I&#39;ve always know there were shills and paid trolls but this shit was blatant and obvious and  it was really surreal. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We are not without defense, fortunately.  And for these past 23 years since the Internet was given to us by its creators we have finally been able to talk with each other about what is wrong and unjust in this world and how we might defend ourselves against this and someday defeat it.  I have no doubt whatsoever that we will, at some point no one can yet predict.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is my opinion that those who wish to truly defend the internet and all it stands for (the symbiotic relationship of man and machine, which embodies a new stage of evolution in its own right) are hidden in both the categorical Internet where everyone is technically known, and the deep web where everyone is unknown. Honestly... we all are still human. We still both want privacy and social democracy, and the anonymity and subjective personality provided by both of these hubs of information are, frankly, necessary for prolonged existence of neutrality on the web. Think about it... most other utilities are regulated within 10 years of their creation. The lack of regulation had been the reason behind the dot com bust in the late 90s/early 00s, as well as intellectual property becoming a huge issue.</p>

<p>But... we can talk all day until the cows come home. When we start acting upon the ideals we set forth here and in other bastions of hope, whether it is a small forum like this or large social media sites, that’s when change starts. It takes time and patience. But the most important thing... is that we realize that we are all in his together. We are blinding ourselves from the reality that we have made this planet uninhabitable with petty squabbles revolving around our Egos. It is disparities which divide us and we are only as strong as our weakest link.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A thoughtful and compassionate comment, yours.  Thanks for that.</p>

<p>I myself was first trained, 50 years ago, as a cultural anthropologist.  Then, a few years later, I found myself in the restaurant business, dabbling with computers.  With that little bit of information it is possible that you can figure out even who I am, but my point is that I understand how we can still be the same people we were thousands of years ago, only one or two hundred generations, yet we have, in recent centuries, endowed ourselves and our descendants with science and technology, and we live in a way which is beyond the wildest dreams of those who came before us.  </p>

<p>Our challenge from this point onward is to manage technology, and I, too, fear that our failures to properly manage our governments, the environment and the animals with whom we share this earth deprive us of any assurance that the future shall remain bright.  You correctly identify the rough road we are still traveling - that we must realize we are all in this together.  I hope we shall have more such exchanges.  I&#39;ve marked you as a friend and will support your comments as you have supported mine.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol I appreciate it dude. We’re all brothers and sisters under the sun. I only come here to support. The internet at its core is meant to bring people together; to support one another. Everyone is a friend to me on here, regardless of whether they are trying to troll me, make fun of me, or otherwise prove me wrong. That’s okay. The internet is ultimately impersonal and we should take every bit of information we find on here with a grain of salt.</p>

<p>There’s a measure of responsibility needed when going online. I think the 90s with AOL kind of provided a test for those willing (you know what I’m talking about... the logging on... the noise, oh dear lord the noise of the fax/phone line), and that sort of diminished with ISP consolidation, higher speeds, and telecommunications law (1996, 2001, 2008, 2010, 2013).</p>

<p>Younger generations have not had this and for them the internet really is like a right to them, not a privilege. Regardless it is a wonderful distraction. </p>

<p>In my opinion...  we have within us the power to solve all of our problems, without clandestine plans or utilitarian ends. If we truly did create the internet... then we have the power to harness our entire species soon enough. Hopefully</p>
