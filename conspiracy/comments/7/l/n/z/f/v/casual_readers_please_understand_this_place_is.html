<p>No my only point is shills are here by the thousands to stifle conversation on various subjects.  I don&#39;t have to believe a particular theory to want to discuss it.  Those who downvote stories in a conspiracy sub don&#39;t want those theories discussed.  If they didn&#39;t care, they would simply bypass it....but they don&#39;t.  They make it a point to shit all over it.  Why take the effort?  Never once have I believed in the flat earth theory, having seen the curve of the earth with my own eyes, but that doesn&#39;t mean I am going to jump into a thread about it and shit all over everything.</p>

<p>These shills spend hours downvoting and arguing against things they pretend not to care about, and its laughable.  That&#39;s why they will always be easy to spot.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you understand that even if the 9/11 towers fell by controlled demolition, there were still tonnes of people who died with the buildings falling? The plane crash itself would have only had a hand-full of casualties compared to the fall, so even if one were to take your bait, your argument doesn&#39;t hold up to start with.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think almost anything is a possibility, to be honest. I think it&#39;s possible that the planes were remote controlled like drones, and I think that it&#39;s possible it was just a controlled demolition and people just reacted to the initial blast like a plane crash. I don&#39;t know which one is likely, but you have to be precise with your language. To try to make somebody claim that <strong>nobody</strong> died in the 9/11 plane crash is to compartmentalize a small aspect of a very large event. People are going to assume you mean 9/11 as a whole, and not just the small detail of whether or not there were planes with people on board or even planes at all. It&#39;s besides the point - the buildings fell and that was the lion&#39;s share of the damage done by far. Why argue about an insignificant aspect in regards to the big picture?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a school of thought that part of the illusion was to gradually empty the towers while still making everyone believe they were a bustling hub of activity and full of busy workers. So that when they fell, it was purely a demolition job. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying this is true, I&#39;m just saying there is some substance to the idea that the 9/11 victims were fake, since some of them definitely seem to be contrived &quot;vicsims.&quot; And the lack of wrongful death lawsuits brought against everyone involved by the families. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why create all of those risky insiders? Were all the workers in the building in on this then? I don&#39;t see how this school of thought holds up to pragmatism and logic.</p>

<p>If you are making this large of a play, why do you care about government wrongful death lawsuits paid with taxpayer money? If you are dropping the WTC towers in NYC, why are you shying away from a few casualties? People were going to die when the towers fell regardless, so why create a smoking gun possibility?</p>

<p>With that said, is it possible that certain floors/businesses were on the inside and were told to evacuate or not show up that day as to protect their employees and managers? Absolutely - no argument there. I just don&#39;t think it could have been done as a rule, I don&#39;t see how you mitigate that risk in a reasonable manner.</p>

<p>All of us saw the planes. All of us heard the planes. Not only does a plane flying low over the city look pretty fucking distinct, it also sounds very different from a small drone or missile. </p>

<p>There’s room for conspiracies in the world without every single one being true. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No I saw the second plane, but one of my friends  who was walking to Stuyvesant high saw the first hit, as did the person in Battery Park. The towers are right there and can be seen easily. I have spent a lot of time in airports, in planes, and have always had an avid interest in aviation. I know what a passenger plane looks and sounds like. </p>

<p>This is ignoring the bullshit claim that it’s easy to fake videos from multiple angles with the exact same details that somehow magically match up with what I and thousands of other New Yorkers saw with our own eyes. I used to work in CG and video editing, you can’t get that many details that right and completely skip the uncanny valley with early 00s tech. Even now it would be difficult to get that perfect. </p>

<p>If you really want to get into it we can talk about how absurdly impossible it would be to organize that many people without anyone saying anything, but you strike me as someone who so wants these things to be true that you will ignore any and all evidence (even someone who lives in NYC and fucking saw it happen) that goes against your preferred belief. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The videos don&#39;t match up though, that&#39;s one way we know they are fake. I already linked September Clues, the first 30 minutes of which are sufficient to prove this. Maybe someone else will watch it.</p>

<p>Somene&#39;s claim on the internet doesn&#39;t change the fact that what we saw on television was physically impossible. </p>

<p>Never mind the question of why school children would be in perfect position to watch a plane strike 17 minutes into a military-style evacuation from that exact location.</p>

<p>When a massive plane flies low over the city you look at it. When it crashes into a massive building it&#39;s not so weird for people to go outside and look for themselves. These are high school kids for fucks sake, they ran outside to look before any teachers could say shit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Videos do match up. I watch them every year on 9/11. Some idiot can edit and zoom in on something and claim it wasn’t in the other video, and you’ll believe him when in reality it’s what happens when you see things from different angles. Shit gets blocked by other shit. </p>

<p>Physically impossible how? Do you really want to get into the physics with me? Really? Because bring it on. I know my shit.</p>

<p>All you are is someone on the internet making claims because someone else on the internet made claims.

<p>Someone who actually cares about learning the truth, actually cares about conspiracies, would not be so open to literally every claim made about government false flag attacks.

    <div class="md"><p>You seem really adamant and touchy about this issue. If you know you saw a plane hit the tower with your own eyes, who cares what I say? Who cares that it&#39;s physically impossible for a relatively light and hollow object to fully embed itself in a relatively massive and solid object regardless of speed? Who cares that there are no visible airline logos on any of the planes in any videos, nor strobe lights, not to mention the CGI glitches involving the wings and vertical stabilizer? Just go your merry way and tell people you were there and you saw it. Then, if they want, they can use their own common sense, watch a no-planes presentation, and see which one is more believable to them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Like I said, all of these claims have been debunked by multiple sources. Your understanding of physics and engineering is pretty poor if you don&#39;t understand how a plane flew into a building. You are straight up demonstrating you don&#39;t know how the twin towers were constructed. </p>

<p>The towers were not solid and massive objects all the way through. They were mostly a frame around a solid core. That way you can build tall without making it untenably heavy. </p>

<p>If anything hitting a glass and steel wall perpendicularly will do far more damage than hitting an aluminum and plastic tube along it&#39;s axis. Take a cardboard tube for example. You can easily bend the sides by pushing them, but smash it hole side first and the sides are suddenly much stronger. </p>

<p>The fact that you can&#39;t even figure out that layman physics when trying to shoot this down demonstrates how naively you approach this and how easily you buy into bullshit videos about it. </p>

<p>Regardless of speed? Do you even fucking math?</p>

<p>This is you showing signs of honest to god mental illness, it kind of makes this less enjoyable to be frank. You need help my friend.

    <div class="md"><p>Sure, this is the quickest way I know to explain it, even though it&#39;s not all-inclusive.</p>

<p>It is quickly seen that there was no plane crash at the Pentagon or in Shanksville, so this must beg the question: why wouldn&#39;t all 4 crash sites be faked instead of half of them?</p>

<p>Imagine a massive steel support column like the ones that made up the twin towers standing by itself in an open field. We can all imagine a passenger jet crashing into it and what would obviously happen: the column would remain relatively intact and the plane would be sheared in half in a horrific fireball.</p>

<p>Yet on 9/11 we are supposed to believe that a hollow aluminum passenger jet was able to penetrate all the way into several of these solid massive steel columns, which are configured together and reinforced with steel trusses and concrete. Not only this, but they don&#39;t even slow down at all as they melt all the way into the buildings like Wile E. Coyote through a canyon wall. </p>

<p>Flying a jet into a skyscraper like the twin towers would only result in one thing: the jet being destroyed external to the building with its contents violently splattered down the building. What we saw on television is physically impossible therefore did not happen.</p>

<p>Like I said, this is the short version but it&#39;s sufficient to explain why what we saw on television was just tv special effects. Anyone who watches even the first 30 minutes of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gORu-68SHpE">September Clues</a> can easily see that there was video fakery going on that day, coordinated between multiple news outlets.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is reasonable enough an explanation. To be honest I&#39;ve always avoided conversation about the planes hitting the towers because the attacks hit very close to home, but I&#39;ve always been outspoken regarding the video released from the Pentagon. It very much looked to be a cruise missile, and to only leave a 6&#39; hole in the exterior wall??</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah and where there should have been a few dozen different camera angles we were only shown a few frames without even a plane in them.</p>

<p>The trajectory would of course have been impossible because the story goes that the plane took out some street lights or other poles on the way towards the Pentagon, but of course if it hit even one of them then the fuel would have spilled out of the wings leaving a fiery mess all over the lawn, yet there&#39;s nothing like this. The main question at the Pentagon and Shanksville is <em>where&#39;s the plane???</em></p>

<p>Once you get past the &quot;there were thousands of eyewitnesses&quot; myth, it&#39;s simply not physically possible for a jet to penetrate into a solid mass of steel and concrete without first being destroyed. Newton&#39;s 3rd Law states that running a plane into a building would have the same result as smashing a building into a stationary plane. But we&#39;re supposed to believe that the plane just melts into the building like a knife going into butter....</p>

<p>All it takes is looking carefully at the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7RMhRIjXV8&amp;amp;t=53s">Hezarkhani footage</a> (for example) to see how glitchy it is, how it&#39;s nothing more than a video composite with a plane sprite.</p>

<p>There&#39;s so many other ways to tell it was faked too, like the witnesses who saw &quot;no plane&quot; or who insisted it was a bomb, the fact that the videos aren&#39;t consistent with one another (shown by September Clues), and the lack of vortices in the smoke that would have been left by the wingtips and remained spiraling for maybe even as long as several minutes after the plane passed through the smoke.  Ace Baker might have been the first to describe this. He has also offered a $100,000 reward to anyone who has an original quality plane strike video. </p>

<p>And most everyone knows that the government has failed to even prove that the alleged terrorists were on the planes, 2 of which (planes) were not even in the air on 9/11 and the other 2 of which were not decommissioned until years later!</p>

<p>We are discussing theories, often times when proof positive is unavailable.  Often times the proof will become available later on, and that&#39;s when something goes from conspiracy theory to conspiracy fact, but absent that no one can prove which theories are truly damaging to the establishment. </p>

<p>Also, who appointed you representative of the sub exactly?  When did you become the spokesperson for what others in this sub need?  Did I miss the election or what?</p>

<p>Nah, I don&#39;t need to identify any points, because I am not here trying to really convince anyone of anything.  I jumped in this thread to make one point, and that point is something which many users in this sub can agree with, there are armies of shills crawling all over this sub like cockroaches, and they will mass downvote topics, topics which may be very damaging to the establishment.  </p>

<p>The rest of &quot;fake pictures&quot; is debatable at best. For example Nestor Citron is not a mirrored picture. The angle of his head is different in both pictures. Also he scrolls past 10 pictures that look very different and stops at one pair that&#39;s similar to prove a point.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean just stop for a minute and think. NYC is one of the most populated places in the world. Thousands of people worked in the buildings of the WTC. And thousands more work around the area and walk by that place every day. </p>

<p>You are telling me that someone they got all those thousands of people to be in on a conspiracy? Because to avoid any death you are talking controlled demolition and removing the people from the scene. </p>

<p>Again you can probably go there and still talk to people who where there on the day of the attacks and saw it happen. There are HUNDREDS of first responders (medical personal, police, firemen, good samaritans that were passing by) that went there that day and saw people die. You are talking a conspiracy so big that they somehow paid off the whole city. </p>

<p>You can discuss if the attack was an inside job, or if they let it happen, you can discuss the politics that comes with such an attack, but I find it downright crazy and disrespectful to flat out say &quot;nobody died&quot;. It defies all logic. </p>

<p>Even if you can make an argument that there where explosives in the tower I find it impossible to believe they somehow evacuated all the thousands of people working at and around the towers and then went on and put a circus using a lot of human resources as first responders. You can&#39;t keep a secret when thousands need to shut up for it to work. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, mathematically it&#39;s probably not that unprobable.  I admititly didn&#39;t read any of those links but I&#39;m going to count that some of these people know or are related to someone who knew someone that was killed giving them another degree of separation.</p>

<p>I see it like this, how many people would be able to claim to know me if something like this happened to me?  Everyone in my small hometown (times 2, moved when I was young), everyone in 18 years of school, a hundred or so I met in college, 1000&#39;s that have worked in the same places at the same time I did.  Add all of those up and I&#39;m in the 10s of thousands.  now consider that is just me in a small town and working at a largish company in a employee facing position, expand that by saying we know each other (and you are claiming to know someone shot), now I can claim it happened because you said it did.  Now if you take any 1 of the victims and they are going to have the same 10,000+ plus people that can claim they knew someone shot.</p>

<p>Also, when victim&#39;s families hear that there are people going around claiming something never happened, those families have a way of finding their way into these conversations, artifically inflating the number of people claiming to know someone shot here, possibly enough to sway to make you think they aren&#39;t real people.</p>

<p>Not saying they are or they aren&#39;t.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I invite you when you have time to look at a few of the conversations and see for yourself if you think those people are telling the truth. Often they are people claiming to either have direct connection or two degrees of separation from a victim. It&#39;s not just someone who knows someone who knows someone who knows someone. And furthermore none of them can prove their claims in any way. </p>

<p>I will go ahead and assert: no way they are all telling the truth. By your logic the odds would be fair that I myself would know someone who has some connection to the event, but I do not, nor does anyone I know. The odds that 40 users within 3 months on a conspiracy forum would claim to have such connections are impossibly vanishingly small. </p>

<p>And if one is lying, they are probably all lying. Otherwise why would anyone need to lie about this at all?</p>

<p>Would it be easier to get actors to participate in a drill or to participate in a scenario where they know innocent people are being murdered and have to just trust not only that they won&#39;t be found guilty as accomplice but also that <em>they</em> aren&#39;t the ones going to be shot. &quot;Here, you&#39;re wearing a mauve badge, and we only shoot people with taupe badges, so don&#39;t worry.&quot;</p>

<p>Think of the <strong>goals</strong> of events like this. Is it increased security and police state, and increased gun control, or do they just want to shoot a bunch of people for some reason? I maintain that the <strong>goal</strong> is not to kill people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Having actors involved at all makes it way riskier. Actors leaking the reality of what occurred is a riskier way of having your plans fall apart than anything concrete coming up about the shooting being expertly and covertly engineered. It would be easier to have innocent people die and innocent people respond than get any actors at all involved dude. You&#39;re missing these points. <strong>If</strong> there&#39;s a goal, you can bet it&#39;s a lot more like &quot;for the greater good&quot; than &quot;don&#39;t kill people&quot;.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t seem to be aware of how easily State Funded Terrorism is considered. The declassified CIA docs are a great resource for this, there are for example detailed plans, including the hijacking, covert destruction and staged missile attacking of a commercial airliner full of innocents, as a trigger to instigate American intervention in Cuba. The plan was never utilised so was allowed to be released, but it was an actual option they came up with and discussed.</p>

<p>So what do <strong>I</strong> think about all this in the end? I don&#39;t fucking know, I&#39;d just be making assumptions, and fuck that</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok so it is risky that someone might &quot;leak&quot; that a staged event occurred but there&#39;s no risk in committing mass murder and protecting oneself from investigation. How the fuck that makes sense is a mystery, but then again you know nothing about Las Vegas because I hate to break it to you, dude, but actors were definitely involved.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The difference is scale. If it was all made up with all actors in the venue, then you&#39;d have a conspiracy involving at the very least 550 people. </p>

<p>If it&#39;s just the FBI who radicalized the perpetrator(which they&#39;ve been caught doing loads of time) then you&#39;re down to something like 10 people. It&#39;s way easier to contain, especially if you manage to &quot;suicide&quot; the person you radicalized. </p>

<p>Of course both carries a risk, what if the perp realizes he is being played, and will be killed in a staged suicide and instead turns on his &quot;co-conspirators&quot;, that&#39;s a risk, but it&#39;s a lot smaller risk than having 550ish people knowing it was a staged event. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t buy the whole &quot;crisis actor&quot; thing, mainly because it&#39;d be much easier and safer to just radicalize someone they know is unstable or easily manipulated, and then have them do all the dirty work and just mop up the trail as they go. </p>

There are also videos of people saying &quot;fake gunshots&quot; and &quot;it doesn&#39;t look like there&#39;s anyone actually injured.&quot; There are also videos where the sounds of gunshots are going off and yet people are not even flinching.</p>

<p>There is one video of an ER, of civilians bringing other civilians into the waiting room, <em>no blood anywhere,</em> and no actual medical staff doing any sort of actual medical activity. </p>

<p>If there are no real victims, there is obviously no real need to get much hospital staff involved. Hospitals certainly take part in mass casualty drills, however. They can always appeal to HIPAA and thus remain quiet about the number of victims they had.</p>

<p>I think the gunshot sounds were played over loudspeakers and/or added in post-production to the videos.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah brohann, simply out of the fact that way way more people are now involved. I like how you put words in my mouth there about &quot;no&quot; risk. That&#39;s a pretty common tactic with people like you who just tunnel vision and effectively block out reality. I said there was <em>greater risk of plans failing</em> if you use actors. Not &quot;no risk&quot;. But I&#39;ll check the vid</p>

<p>Edit: uh ok, this vid is of someone who was at the Las Vegas event, who also happens to be an actor? Big story</p>

<p>Look, do you really think that if it was all staged, that actors such as this lady would be entrusted with keeping quiet during the following chaos and potential legal action? But it&#39;s ok now I understand you&#39;re another person who just tunnel visions. Essentially a brick wall who spins all inflowing information to fit your little narrative. There&#39;s no point in us conversing other than it being visible to other readers. So.. good luck with your endeavors 👍</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I encounter the same exact lack of logic when it comes to super crazy conspiracies. I like to read about them, look into them, but if there is a huge lack of logic involved I get skeptical. If you were smart, you would not hire a bunch of everyday actors for an event like this. It would get out. If you did this repeatedly, the truth would get out in such obnoxiously concrete ways. It would absolutely make more sense to actually plan a shooting, no question.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That’s a claim. I’m just pointing out statistical logic. Is it really that absurd to think that people are violently killing each other? It happens constantly all over the world. Just seems like there’s no logic to it at all. If the anonymous omnipresent powers that be wanted to increase security or deprive freedoms, they would just do it. Why do you think public opinion would stop them in this regard? WTF do you think they have the power to organize such a thing but cannot organize a new backdoor policy without mainstream approval? There’s already plenty of mass murders, crime, drug trafficking. They already have all the excuses they would need. So until someone can give me motive that makes sense, rather than lack of motive altogether, it’s going to remain illogical to me.</p>

<p>If you think the internet is the end-all source of knowledge, you’re wrong. Maybe the evidence exists it’s just not uploaded, I don’t know. Maybe you just don’t trust any of it. But when arguments are specifically illogical, I think it’s worth mentioning. Trusting digital evidence is a different story, but saying there is no evidence, also a different story. Pointing out the entire argument being illogical is still valid.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting vid. Thanks for sharing, how would I go about validating the interview itself? Couldn&#39;t that be someone trying to push the conspiracy theory agenda, themselves? Or could it be she just happened to be at the shooting and they got her to do an interview because she had already been on tv? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>She&#39;s obviously an attempt to push the notion of multiple shooters to cause misplaced discussion and tail-chasing among conspiracy circles.</p>

<p>Is it more likely that she was chosen because she was an actor who happened to be at a real shooting, or that she is an actress who is acting at a fake shooting?</p>

<p>Then to her performance, add Mike Cronk. Does he seem authentic to anyone on earth?  <a href="https://www.liveleak.com/view?i=661_1507078678&amp;amp;comments=1">https://www.liveleak.com/view?i=661_1507078678&amp;amp;comments=1</a></p>

<p>I can see their point, though ultimately I&#39;m sympathetic to you. I&#39;m sympathetic to all you authentic people out there just trying to figure out what the fuck is going on.

<p>Shout out to all the people trying to do the right thing though</p>

<p>(Edit: Wouldn&#39;t it be way riskier and difficult to <em>stage</em> a shooting like this than to actually engineer a shooting though?)</p>

<p>It could not be more obvious that there is a frantic effort to gaslight about Las Vegas with the main thrust of the argument being that no matter what, any conspiracy theories are on the table but people <em>must</em> believe people are actually getting shot at these FEMA drill scenarios. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The frist premise that the videos were edited is reliant on the entire world media being in on the conspiracy too. I saw the impact live on german television who had their own feed live from New York.</p>

<p>Is the german media controlled by the CIA and FBI too?</p>

<p>The rest of &quot;fake pictures&quot; is debatable at best. For example Nestor Citron is not a mirrored picture. The angle of his head is different in both pictures. Also he scrolls past 10 pictures that look very different and stops at one pair that&#39;s similar to prove a point.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean just stop for a minute and think. NYC is one of the most populated places in the world. Thousands of people worked in the buildings of the WTC. And thousands more work around the area and walk by that place every day. </p>

<p>You are telling me that someone they got all those thousands of people to be in on a conspiracy? Because to avoid any death you are talking controlled demolition and removing the people from the scene. </p>

<p>Again you can probably go there and still talk to people who where there on the day of the attacks and saw it happen. There are HUNDREDS of first responders (medical personal, police, firemen, good samaritans that were passing by) that went there that day and saw people die. You are talking a conspiracy so big that they somehow paid off the whole city. </p>

<p>You can discuss if the attack was an inside job, or if they let it happen, you can discuss the politics that comes with such an attack, but I find it downright crazy and disrespectful to flat out say &quot;nobody died&quot;. It defies all logic. </p>

<p>Even if you can make an argument that there where explosives in the tower I find it impossible to believe they somehow evacuated all the thousands of people working at and around the towers and then went on and put a circus using a lot of human resources as first responders. You can&#39;t keep a secret when thousands need to shut up for it to work. </p>
