    <div class="md"><p>You might not win, but that&#39;s not really the point. The point is forcing the media to talk about 911 truth.  Think of Ron Paul.  They wanted to ignore him, he raised enough money that they couldn&#39;t.  He didn&#39;t win, but he got his message out to a lot of people in the process.  Politics is a platform/stage that we can promote our message from.</p>

They won&#39;t even bother killing one when they know it will have no effect other than to drive more suspicion towards them.  Anyway, now that I&#39;ve fed the troll, go ahead and make up some more bullshit about why that won&#39;t work and how we&#39;re all doomed to die and there is nothing we can do and we should just be slaves and do nothing.

    <div class="md"><p>I think the best thing to do is to openly talk about it with friends and family. It&#39;s the biggest red pill we got. And it&#39;s easiest to swallow if you actually get them to look into it. I think that&#39;s where this needs to start, on a personal level. But it would be amazing if we actually had a candidate follow through. I guess Trump doesn&#39;t believe the events of 9/11 but then he will go ahead and use that as an excuse for Infinity War. Regardless,</p>
