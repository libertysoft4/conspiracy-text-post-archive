<p>My sisters&#39; boyfriend has been living for the last 3 years in a cottage with my sister. They are around 25 years old. They dont talk to anyone, they dont work, they dont leave the house, they live from parents. They are both heavily intro conspiracies leading them up to the desision of abandoning any social life. My sister wouldnt give a fuck about that shit untill her boyfriend, she was normal. </p>

<p>She will be mid twenties in a bit with no skill or knowledge whatsoever. They dont do drugs. They just let them selves get 
affected by the all this bullshit. When they see chemtrails, they lock themselves in, because it makes them feel bad. She thinks we are all stupid and shes got it figured out, we don&#39;t understand and all that..</p>

<p>I dont know what to do. Best thing would take her away from her boyfriend, but how is that possible without burning every bridge down? I ve thought of therapist, but she would probably never agree.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is really good advice.</p>

<p>I&#39;d also like to add that you need to make it clear you&#39;re not attacking them. Their first instinct will be to clam up/get defensive, so following the first point can go a long way to helping them see you&#39;re on their side. It really can get overwhelming burying one&#39;s self in this stuff all day, every day. Getting a breath of fresh air does wonders for the entrenched psyche. You can even point to the sticky on the front page here where the mod says taking a break from the scene improved their mental well-being. </p>

<p>Bottom line is perception is reality. If we spend all day reading about TPTB plotting our demise and elites subverting our cultures and values and whatever else, that&#39;s all you&#39;ll see when you look around. Now a lot of this stuff is awful and true, but it doesn&#39;t stop everyone from living their lives. The VAST majority of communities are normal people who are only looking to lead happy lives and help the ones they care about.</p>

<p>What happens when you get &quot;too deep&quot; is you withdraw and insulate yourself from these people, your neighbors. It weakens the community and everyone ends up losing from it. A favorite line of thinking here is TPTB aim to divide and conquer. OP tell your friends that by isolating themselves, they are only letting the bad guys win.</p>

<p>I hope this helps, bit longer than I planned to write ☺</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I thought I was bad, there always is someone worse though huh? </p>

<p>For a while just going to work gave me anxiety, not sure if it was the conspiracies or just a weird phase.  I was just constantly thinking how messed up the world is, all these people in this shitty call center wasting their lives because that&#39;s how it&#39;s been set up. </p>

<p>I even have this sub open in a side window while I&#39;m working. </p>

<p>But then I split that side off from normal conversation with most other people aside from a few close friends. </p>

<p>I think I find happiness from searching within, thinking about the nature of our reality (like I have all the answers, ha) and my relationships, friends and significant other. </p>

<p>Is see what you&#39;re saying, but I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s true. I think we have to live in the real world, and work through how dark things really are. It really is that bad, and it really should rock you to the core of your soul. It&#39;s just that you have to get back up and fight back once you come to that realization.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’m going to assume you’re authentic and try to give you the most honest answer I can for you right now.</p>

<p>Anyone on this sub that isn’t a shill or anyone that looks into conspiracies and organized crime and deception is looking for one thing - truth.</p>

<p>If they are both feeling anti-social and self destructive it is a direct result of EGO and POWER effecting their decision making.  I remember when I was redpilled after 9/11 because my dad was tipped off.  I have not stopped researching since.</p>

<p>Just last year, 16 years after pain, confusion and depression, I found oneness and motivation in understanding that life as we know it is not limited to the human experience.  Looking into the Podesta emails you get a grim idea of the darkest entities on the planet and the horrific damages they are doing to Souls around the planet.</p>

<p>I say SOULS because they (Cabaal, Illuminati, Deep State, Vatican etc.) seek to literally consume that which is LIGHT AND PURE so they can thrive.</p>

<p>Your sister and her boyfriend are in a state where they feel defeated by their reality.  Their ego, their power is seemingly diminished by things they can’t control.  Not CONSPIRACIES but REALITIES in the inorganic imbalances of light and darkness being perpetuated on Earth.  I would say to support them, because in their current state they are gaining new knowledge and protecting themselves.</p>

<p>The wakeup call will come when they realize that if they want their souls journey to continue with omnipotence after the human experience, it makes more sense to be POSITIVE, LIGHT and ACTIVE.  I believe in them because it happened to me.  Now I’m far more successful in my life and instead of supressing my knowledge I filter it to make it digestible for those around me in an attempt to BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER.  I am now happier and doing what I love.</p>

<p>Obviously, helping your sister is more complex than conveying positivity, but if she understands the SOUL and its everlasting presence, she would change her human ways to preserve the potential for oneness when this short experience on Earth ends.</p>

However I never fell down the rabbit hole as far as he did.  He worked a little but relied on our parents to periodically save him. He dabbled in drugs but besides what we all called LSD at the time , nothing in the extreme.  After the death of our parents , receiving his last big financial gift,he changed his name and doesn’t communicate. He had an internet presence with his new identity for a few years but that has faded away. I think about him every once in a while and when I’m in the last place he was known to be I look around. I don’t miss him. He became a poisonous person.</p>

<p>How to solve it? Talk with them and see where they got stuck. Are they obsessing over the doom porn, or maybe addicted to the internet or something?</p>

<p>Lots of people get stuck because they don&#39;t know how to go back to normal. How do you go work a 9-5 when you know that the world is run by a solar cult of child abusers?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First I would show them that your open minded to Facts. Sometimes conspiracies realy are conspircy. They will listen a lot more if you actully listen to what they say and to agree when things are obviously not what they seem. 
 If they believe in the NWO side of things show them that the way they are acting is just playing into the plan.
Waking up is what stopped me sitting around being stoned all day play fps war games.
It was pointed out to me that not getting out into the comunity, staying stoned and unmotivated was just what they need to win the game.
If you can admit that things like 911, JFK, Boston and 7/7 have many unanswered questions you will be more successful in helping them to see a real conspircy from the crap like flat earth and the reptilian type stuff.
But at the ens of the day guilt trip them that they are just doing the bidding of the NWO by sitting in there believing all the cyops going on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This happened to my brother in law and it ultimately led to a divorce from my wife’s sister. </p>

<p>He was kind of a weird dude to begin with but I think after the divorce he made his way over to his favorite conspiracy media persons city and Volunteered to help. Actually turned his life around a bit but he never really dropped the CT. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cure them or stone them. Much like your homosexuals who are horrified by religious do-gooders trying to get them in a system to reprogram them into a heterosexual, these obsessive compulsive Conspiritards only think you&#39;re trying to change them, indeed, they&#39;ll think you are an actual conspirator.</p>

<p>If we can work together to get a small group of like minded people we can start a campaign to reprogram them but very, very secretly. So nobody can breath a word, we&#39;ll have to conspire to save them. </p>

<p>Yeah, stripping her out of the relationship when he&#39;s out, use some kind of story, like, say somebody was in an accident and have him get on a bus, then go in and take her. Too bad you can&#39;t use ether or knock out drops. You&#39;ll have to have some strong guys who know martial arts in case things go wrong. Perhaps you can dress up as a police man, drug him and put him on a bus to Tijuana with your team, like you were Jason Bourne or something. You know you can always...let&#39;s not go there unless we have to. Let&#39;s set up a meeting over at 4-Chan and plan this out. We can stamp out conspiracy one person at a time, secretly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I recommend the work of Richard Bandler. He is known for being one of the founders of NLP (Neuro Linguistic Programming). People have since taken his work and used it for bad, but I think he was really trying to help people get over hard times. He believed anyone could be cured, even schizophrenics. They need to see it for themselves before they can make change. They are probably so determined in their mind that they are right about all these things (it is possible they are, you know) and they feel isolated because no one can understand. I think everyone here can relate to that a bit and that&#39;s why we speak openly here. Good luck to you all. I know it&#39;s a difficult process and am also dealing with family members trying to overcome situations similar to this. I&#39;m actually considering taking technology away from one family member to see how they cope without it. I think it is good to unplug once in a while anyway. I also recommend getting them a gift card for sensory deprivation tank center ;) a great way to reset the brain and calm and active mind.</p>
