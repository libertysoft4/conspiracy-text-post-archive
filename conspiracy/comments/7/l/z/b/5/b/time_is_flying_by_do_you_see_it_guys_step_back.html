        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Doesn&#39;t it feel like time is flying by? Please think about it and approach the topic with care.</p>

<p>Our era since the 2010s have been so... dumb. There has literally been no meaning to this mess. Not to be a hater, but these machines... they&#39;re just that. Machines.</p>

<p>The internet is just filled with... junk, mostly. And everyone has to drudge through it.</p>

<p>The hype about AI. The concern about net neutrality. Robots. Like... Really people? Sigh.</p>

<p>What are you doing, panicking at every turn? Don&#39;t let people appeal to your emotions. Just because someone frightens you, doesn&#39;t mean you have to scream. You are a human being. You will adapt. Point blank. You have choices. Why do people feel like they have no choice? </p>

<p>In this Era...</p>

<p>I don&#39;t like the fact that everyone is universally labelled a &quot;consumer&quot;.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t like the fact that humans worship other humans. This in itself is just... Like why are we allowing this. Why is no one talking about this?</p>

<p>People get their lifestyle knowledge from TV and pop culture. Stop.  We need to be explicit about reality. The way humans work.</p>

<p>Sooner or later we will all realize that the internet and tv and generally electronics stimulate those icy feelings. But being icy is a physical thing like playing a sport, or getting pranked, or diving into a cold lake.</p>

<p>I like machines. But call them what they are. Humans really have some finicky ways of thinking, try to avoid that.</p>

<p><em>People are putting everything in their head.</em> It&#39;s the information era. Yay. But why is it the culture now to just have so <em>much</em> information seeping into our heads. Be careful what you put in your head. It has a direct effect on your mind and body.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s build communities ... also, i dont think were meant to listen to music 24/7. A lot of people are uncomfortable with silence and wont try to be comfortable at all. You should at least try sometimes. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dumb? We have knowledge at our fingertips. Classes of people who historically been denied truth can learn almost any trade for free from YouTube. Human beings have been waking up and learning that we’ve been lied to for centuries. Music is art and has always built communities through emotional communication and expression. I pity your outlook on what this time in human history has gifted us all. If anything, there should be less whining on the internet about how “dumb” everything is and more effort to create a better existence for the human race with the modern tools we’ve been handed. </p>

<p>Pretty much naked women singing about shit so filthy you wouldn&#39;t have even heard anything close in a coal mine 50 years ago.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Art is subjective. Ariana Grande is a classically trained vocalist. Her voice is beautiful. The problem results from the industry&#39;s agenda and control over what&#39;s broadcast to the population. Most pop stars don&#39;t write their own music, which is definitely a knock against their &quot;art&quot; when you consider the complete package. When it&#39;s no longer about the individual and the final product is the result of collaboration between moguls and insiders, sure. You lose most of the artistic value, as then it becomes contrived/inorganic and serves to propagate what &quot;they&quot; (a team of influencers) want you to consume rather than the unique creative vision of a singular person, the artist.</p>

<p>So I both agree and disagree. There is value in the artistic talents of the two people you mentioned. The problem is industry control and the way that artistic expression has become subservient to business and marketing, especially at the top of the pyramid (i.e., within pop culture, &quot;chart-topping&quot; music and blockbuster films).</p>

<p>Also, modesty and chastity are dead in most parts of the world. Trust me, I definitely believe that it&#39;s part of the agenda and that the music and entertainment industries are the vehicles by which those that are in control are subverting &quot;traditional values.&quot; There may be a coordinated plan to hyper-sexualize people, but hyper-purity is nearly (if not equally) as damaging a concept. The middle ground should be the ideal state of being.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not disagreeing that they have skill but art, I reckon, is the complete package regardless of talent, so they&#39;re selling their artistic integrity for imf loans.</p>

<p>I&#39;m also not advocating wholesale chastity but, as you said, this hyper-sexulization is so fucked especially when anyone, regardless of maturity, can access it easily if not have it shoved down their throats and the effects of this are pretty obvious within our society.</p>

<p>So I wasn&#39;t specifically calling out the examples I sighted but I still stand by my statement that it&#39;s not art in my mind.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I accept that and I can&#39;t say that I disagree. Merry Christmas, friend.</p>

<p>To include an anecdote, I was a big Nicki Minaj fan in high school around the time she released her Beam Me Up Scotty mixtape. Her lyrics have always been suggestive and sex-driven, but over time and coupled with her now prevalent image, it&#39;s been catapulted to a whole new level that is truly blurring the line/pushing the boundary between provocative and wholly inappropriate.</p>

<p>That whole &quot;Break the Internet 2.0&quot; thing she just did was pretty much completely tasteless and devoid of any real artistic value. I commented this exact sentiment on Facebook (I try so hard to stay away but I intermittently reactivate for random reasons) and then received a message from her page that said &quot;thanks for your comments.&quot; Super strange...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Time is speeding up due to the relativity of aging. When you are 10 years old 1 year represented 10% of your life. When you are 50 years old that same 1 year represents only 2% of your life. After a while the years just start to blur together giving the appearance of time speeding up. Time appears to move much slower for young people because they have a smaller frame of reference. When you are older years feel like a short period of time. Can you even remember what you did for your birthday 4 or 5 years ago?</p>

<p>Families go through this ritual every year at Christmas. The older relatives will say how much the kids have grown while the kids will wonder what everyone is talking about. Kids think that Christmas took forever to get here while the adults are shocked another year has gone by already. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Time doesn&#39;t exist. It&#39;s your perception of time that is speeding up. The longer you are alive the quicker your perception of time gets. Remember when you were a kid and ten more minutes of play time felt like an eternity? This is likely because the standard measurements of time become smaller and smaller fractions of your tot existence so they appear to go by quciker. When you are 3 years old a year is a 33.3% of your existence but when you are 40 it is only 2.5%.</p>

<p>But its not like the alternative is truly meaningful, either. Perhaps the life of a prehistoric human in a community of family and love would have been more fulfilling, but that fulfillment is just as transient and meaningless as what we are living through now.</p>

Yet not stop making nukes and bio weapons! We can fight for freedom to unopression for you third world! We will spend quadrillions on this, but can&#39;t afford to send food.

    <div class="md"><p>I feel ya. I was just looking at old photo albums from my dad&#39;s youth. I can&#39;t help but feel this sense of emptiness with regards to the way things have gone . There seems to be some sparkle back in the 70s and 80s that just isn&#39;t here so much recently. Everything feels kind of ...blahh. A sort of homogenized mush. I feel like the city I live in has lost part of it&#39;s soul.</p>

<p>It sort of feels like the spirit has just gone out. Where is the inspiration? The life? The creativity? </p>

<p>I was thinking about the music 24/7 thing. All the people studying, working while listening to music. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s necessarily bad, but it must have some effects. For instance in a lab I was just working in at school, one of the grad students almost always had very loud music blasting from his computer. It was sometimes inspiring, but it made me think about the quiet moments of consideration that old scientists used to have as a matter of course while they were pondering their work. Surely that quietude or at least lack of music played into their thoughts and discoveries. </p>

<p>Even more intense is the psychological effect of cameras being everywhere, both security cameras at every turn and the phone cameras that can be whipped out at any moment. That HAS to have a major psychological effect on people&#39;s behavior even if they think it doesn&#39;t. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The hype about AI. The concern about net neutrality. Robots. <del>Like... Really people? Sigh.</del></p>

<p>Is extremely distracting and I used to love it, but now I&#39;m over it. I&#39;m a gen Zer, apparently I &quot;can&#39;t survive without technology&quot;. Which was true for a while... before I started to grow up. We need to first look at our bodies and observe our own mind.</p>

<p>What&#39;s the effect of having these earphones plugged in for so long, listening to music so frequently so for so long, listening to <em>these lyrics</em> for so long? Lyrics in certain songs don&#39;t make much sense and is sort of demonic is you&#39;re skeptical like that.</p>

<p>Be extra careful with the things that are inorganic. We weren&#39;t meant to do a lot of things, but we push it and push it thinking we&#39;re somehow immune. Not that we shouldn&#39;t have certain things, though...</p>

<p>Advancement of technology = advancement of technology</p>

<p>advancement of technology =/= advancement of humans</p>

<p>That&#39;s my argument, even though I&#39;m not here to argue with anyone (and I just wrote my last essay of the season so I&#39;m done with academia till next year). Though I&#39;m not arguing anything. I&#39;m just telling you how it is and sharing my thoughts. I don&#39;t have to argue about human beings overdoing everything. That&#39;s a fact.</p>

<p>But <em>like.....really</em> no one reads super long posts with tons of arguments unless it&#39;s u/polkadotgirl. She is eloquent in a way I wish I was.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you are quite eloquent!</p>

<p>I agree with your statement - technology is a tool. It is not inherently good or bad.</p>

<p>The problem, though, is the world is moving so fast technologically that we are not taking time to examine it.</p>

<p>I was watching this video about 5g, and they were putting up these cancerous towers in a community. People were at least protesting.</p>

<p>Still, the majority remain unaware of apathetic. Further, there is propaganda pushed that &quot;technology = progress.&quot;</p>

<p>I am kind of rambling so my apologied if this comment is not making sense.</p>
