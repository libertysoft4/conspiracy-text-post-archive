    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s not the case.  I see the persisting &quot;contrails&quot; year round.  I live in a place with cold winters and warm summers.  You can&#39;t tell me that when I see them all the time, its actually opposing temps in the air during both seasons.</p>

<p>Besides this, the sheer amount of sundogs that show up just when planes pass over my area shows that light diffraction is the goal.  Though, paired with aluminum there is nothing good about this process.</p>

<p>Refractive indices of water vapor and the garbage in chemtrails is what gives this away.  They are different.  Light bounces through these materials differently and that is why we now suddenly see sundogs, which used to be quite rare, quite often.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4OHLx6bX8k">Let Patrick Roddie tell you how its done.</a>.

<p>You mean halos and rainbows? IE Extremely common phenonomena. Sundogs are not halos and rainbows, but the chemtrail crowd can&#39;t seem to tell the difference. I&#39;ve seen Roddie&#39;s videos. They show halos and rainbows.</p>

<p>Look at a true sundog <a href="https://c.tadst.com/gfx/750x500/sundog.jpg?1">here</a>. Roddie does not record these regularly. He records halos and rainbows. These are average, every day phenonmena.</p>

<p>But step back for a second. Think realistically about the logistics that would be required. No chemtrail believer has ever been able to explain to me how this massive deception has been executed. Realistically - how would you even explain that?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you speaking for me?  I&#39;m not sure why you have to put words into my mouth here.  I understand what a halo or a rainbow is, don&#39;t insult my and other people&#39;s intelligence here.</p>

<p>I have personally seen many, many sundogs and have them on camera and on video that result from trailing left over my city.  They are not a rare thing any longer.  </p>

<p>I specifically have the rainbow effect captured coming through only a trail left by a plane and not through any other cloud.</p>

<p><a href="https://imgur.com/a/V5HDX">Here is an example, not mine own but I&#39;m sure you can see what I&#39;m talking about here.</a></p>

<p>Before you go putting more words into my mouth, I understand that example is not of an entire &quot;sundog&quot;.  I don&#39;t have my personal pictures up just yet.  I have many that show a full sundog around the sun coming through trails specifically.  This example is part of the same effect but the trail is clearly refracting light as you can tell.</p>

<p>Patrick Roddie is not just taking about rainbows, btw.  Again, almost speaking for him and telling us that what he&#39;s is capturing is actually something as mundane as a rainbow.  Give me a break.</p>

<p>Quite the opposite, I think when you do more research most of the popular theories fall apart.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Aluminum inhibits plants ability to uptake nutrients and can kill off plants.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And yet our farms are producing at rates never before seen in human history. How do you reconcile those two statements? By your own words our farms should be barren.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>particulate metals, such as aluminum, barium, strontium, and other metals that pollute the environment, our air, water, and soil</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can as easily explain the presence of these metals from other sources - manufacturing, pollution. You know things we can point at and say &quot;Hey! That&#39;s really bad pollution!&quot;</p>

<p>By obsessing over chemtrails, you&#39;re actually losing touch with REAL environmental concerns. Heavy metal particulates in soil/water are not good...how are they getting there? Probably a polluter in your area. Deal with those polluters! Stop blaming the government for things when the actual polluters are right in front of you...mostly companies that manufacture goods.</p>

<p>I mean you have actual pesticides being sprayed all over crops...maybe you should look closer at those rather than this insane theory that the GOVERNMENT is plotting against you.</p>

<p>What evidence do you have? Almost all theoretical papers on geoengineering are just that, theoretical. Most attempts to control the weather have been abject failures. Yes contrails change the temperature of the below them, but that is the closest thing you can point to and call it &quot;geoengineering&quot;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>There just isn&#39;t any credible proof. Contrails are natural phenomena, so that&#39;s gone. No one has ever been able to show the spraying mechanism, or uncover any documentation of what would be the worlds biggest logistics program (and one that has run for over a decade). People whose records are not verifiable, their job descriptions completely unrelated, or just general kookiness or willingness to be a &quot;sacrificial lamb&quot; to further some crackpot theory and get semi-celeb status with some whackos on forums do not count as &quot;military whistleblowers&quot;</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a few videos to get you started along with a few articles.</p>

<p>You can debate me all you want but facts are facts and this is in fact going on and you and I both can verify this, although, one of us refuses to accept these facts. That&#39;s not my problem though.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a video with a military whistleblower admitting to these programs and describing details pertaining to it.</p>

<p>Refuse to believe it&#39;s happening if you want but at that point you&#39;re rejecting a reality that&#39;s right in front of your face </p>

<p>Like what? Like peer reviewed journal articles from reputable scientists or teams of scientists? Because almost everything I&#39;ve ever read is purely theoretical.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t see any whistle blowing here. She&#39;s just repeating the usual chemtrail talking points. She offers no actual test results, or any actual evidence. There isn&#39;t anyone who can corroborate her story, not a SINGLE person vouches for her sanity or the stories she has spun.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You really think there would be peer reviewed papers on secret military programs? It would get no funding and would be shut down before it even started. </p>

<p>There&#39;s tons of information on the subject but it&#39;s obvious you want it to be spoon fed to you by the mainstream media, something that would never happen when a program is classified and ongoing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, tell you what - you tell me what the desired effects of chemtrails are...and then tell me what theorhetical research even supports that is possible!</p>

<p>I don&#39;t <em>need</em> to be spoonfed. I&#39;ve gone down the rabbithole. And every hole is 2 feet deep but 10 feet long and loop back on each other.</p>

<p>It&#39;s bunk, bogus. It&#39;s just a way to blame the government for things completely out of their control.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The goal of &quot;chemtrails&quot; aka geo-engineering is a multi faceted program designed to not only &quot;suppress&quot; the Suns rays from hitting earth but also as a tool to help control weather patterns. Even cloud seeding alone can be used to bring rain to crops and even during the Vietnam war it was tossed around as a potential idea to make it harder for enemy troops etc.</p>

<p>There are many articles, papers, videos, testimony, on the subject it&#39;s really not hard to arrive to these conclusions.</p>

<p>Some of the better research done is in the documentary &quot;what in the world are they spraying&quot; and provides the answers to all of your questions </p>
