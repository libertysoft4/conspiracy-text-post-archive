        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">247</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2017-12-21 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/JamesColesPardon.html">JamesColesPardon</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I, like many <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> users and moderators, have been targeted by a cyberbully subreddit known as <a href="/r/TopMindsOfReddit">/r/TopMindsOfReddit</a>.</p>

<p>After playing by all the rules and having my username slandered throughout various drama subs, and after submitting numerous reports to administrators of this site, it appears that this behavior is either tacitly approved or they have an inability to deal with the issue. Like the WOPR said in the 1983 film War Games, the only winning move is not to play.</p>

<p>Over the past few weeks I have had to take time off of reddit for personal reasons and noticed a distinct positive change in my demeanor and mental well-being when I was not participating in the games of this site, including moderating this space. </p>

<p>Since I became a mod here I have been targetted, harassed, and tracked all around reddit – and have had to operate under the assumption that a group of mental ticks in <a href="/r/TopMindsOfReddit">/r/TopMindsOfReddit</a> will misconstrue and malaign any post or comment I make for no other reason that I can discern other than they need to tear people down to pull themselves up. It must be a sad, miserable existence over there, where any wrongthink needs to be ridiculed and mocked, and their targets (us) are quickly banned and unable to respond to any criticism or content submitted in their space, all while continually <a href="/u/ser">/u/ser</a> shouting us behind their digitally walled garden. It&#39;s pathetic, really.</p>

<p>Upon my return, refreshed and family healthy, the harassment almost immediately resumed. It was documented, submitted to the administrators, and all I received was them deleting my comment and stating that &#39;appropriate disciplinary action was taken,&#39; to those I accused.  As of this post the exact account (some a few days old and obviously alts) is still allowed to harass me in their own threads on <a href="/r/annoucements">/r/annoucements</a>.</p>

<p>This leads me to no other conclusion other than reddit being a fractal of life as we have come to know it. Justice for me, but not for thee. Banning subs like <a href="/r/fatpeoplehate">/r/fatpeoplehate</a> due to their content and negativity, but allowing <a href="/r/TopMindsOfReddit">/r/TopMindsOfReddit</a>. Altering their algorithms and tweaking stickied thread-weights to ensure <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> is devoid of certain subreddits, yet clamoring to keep the Net Neutral.</p>

<p>If the administrators of this site refuse to help their volunteers (moderators) who keep their site clean and presentable for their advertisers, do you think they&#39;ll back you when the trolls and cyberbullies come for you? I have six years (2+ as a mod) on this account and have thoroughly enjoyed my experience here until I actually understood how things work around here. And I&#39;m done with it.</p>

<p>When the reforms the sub needs are complete, I will be resigning from my position as moderator of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and am pleading to be left alone.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the only thing left that I can do.</p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>As requested and forseen to be disclosed by <a href="/u/Inquirous2016">/u/Inquirous2016</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7lcujj/targetted_harassment/drlfp8m">here</a> - I see no problem sharing one of the experiences I have chronicled over the last <strong>two years</strong> here (ironically since I became a moderator here in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>).</p>

<p>Below is a timeline, with links to quotes of comments directed at me or mentioning me by a variety of users in a variety of subs, not specifically just comments in <a href="/r/TopMindsOfReddit">/r/TopMindsOfReddit</a>. At the conclusion, I have a suggestion as to how to deal with the problem, and encourage participation in this thread as to the merits of my suggestion in it&#39;s probability of success for dealing with our problem.</p>

<p>A comment by user <a href="/u/LAAgg">/u/LAAgg</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7cqh4t/leaked_emails_show_wikileaks_and_trump_jr/dpsh1es">here</a> three weeks ago stated the following:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You know having mod status in no way gives you the authority to decide what kind of comments or content this community values. <strong>I&#39;ve been here since long before you were a mod</strong> and your stickied comment makes it obvious that you only have your finger on the portion of the community that isn&#39;t completely marginalized other than when a thread makes it to <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Please note that despite what the sidebar of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> says, I&#39;ve been a moderator on the Board there for about 2 years. We did have some shenanigans regarding moderators this year but that is neither here nor there. It’s important in this timeline because the user behind this account is admitting to being part of ‘the game’ for at least two years</p>

<p>Moving forward, we had <a href="/u/Nevermind04">/u/Nevermind04</a> dispute what looked like astroturfed Net Neutrality posts in <a href="/r/vermont">/r/vermont</a> and elsewhere during the &quot;This is my Senator&quot; shenanigans from two weeks ago <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/undelete/comments/7gvhsf/37207328_this_is_my_senator_he_sold_me_my_fellow/dqn5xr6">here</a> where the even the idea of shillery with votes is disputed and laughed at (alluded to above). </p>

<p>Of note there are plenty of users participating in that thread as of a week ago (in what would otherwise be a dead thread) who obviously are there participating due to links followed from so-called drama subs despite specific guidelines in their respective subs for refraining from commenting/voting/participating. Also note is when <a href="/u/Nevermind04">/u/Nevermind04</a> tells states that I don&#39;t work for free, of which I politely respond:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/undelete/comments/7gvhsf/37207328_this_is_my_senator_he_sold_my_fellow/dqn6icw">Nobody does</a> I stated, when <a href="/u/Nevermind04">/u/Nevermind04</a> responded with lazy ad hominems regarding subs I mod (as alluded to above) due to being intellectually <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/undelete/comments/7gvhsf/37207328_this_is_my_senator_he_sold_me_my_fellow/dqn27ja">lazy</a> which led to me responding with a hypotetical:</p>

<p>who pays me?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...which was [responded to 4 days ago by <a href="/u/LAAgg">/u/LAAgg</a>  in what by most redditor&#39;s standards is a dead thread (especially <a href="/r/undelete">/r/undelete</a>) with a bullshit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/undelete/comments/7gvhsf/37207328_this_is_my_senator_he_sold_me_my_fellow/dqs4c4k">quip of</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Probably the RNC or if I had to guess who ever is running the troll farm you&#39;re working at in Ukraine</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, the next few lines go like this:</p>

<p><strong>JCP</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>I heard it&#39;s beautiful this time of year. With that being said - isn&#39;t there a football game to watch?</p>

<p>That seems to be far more relevant than where I cash in my rubles.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong><a href="/u/LAAgg">/u/LAAgg</a></strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>I know* it&#39;s beautiful this time of year.</p>

<p>Edit: Oh missed the ninja edit, and no I haven&#39;t watched much of the NFL since Watson went down. FYI football is kind of like Hockey but no sticks and not on ice, and a big egg shaped ball instead of a puck.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>JCP</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>I never said NFL. The majority of your posts are on <a href="/r/CFB">/r/CFB</a> you fucking hypocrite.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>LAAgg</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>I think you might have an anger problem bud, and fyi theres no college games on Mondays. See this is the kind of thing you need to know. its a big part of American culture, you stick out like a sore thumb not knowing that Mondays&#39; strictly an NFL night.  -FYI your use of hypocrite doesn&#39;t really make sense, if you want to be believeable you also might want to work on your command of the language. I hope my tips are helpful
P.S.: lol on you accusing me of being creepy and stalkerish for looking at your post history, you literally just did the same thing. Even asked if I still lived in LA. Are you trying to doxx me stalker?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I responded with:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If I wanted to doxx you, I would have.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Note that &quot;LA&quot; is in the username of this user (who came at me in a 5 day dead thread in <a href="/r/undelete">/r/undelete</a>, accusing me of living in Ukraine (I guess?) and being paid in rubles. How am I combing through their user history when it&#39;s the first two letters in their user name (and the remainder is nickname for the Texas A &amp; M Aggies, of which the user self-flairs as is in the <a href="/r/CFB">/r/CFB</a> football subreddit that has already been acknowledged. Of note, the user also admits to literally <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/undelete/comments/7gvhsf/37207328_this_is_my_senator_he_sold_me_my_fellow/dqs67l0/">going through conspiracy mod post histories</a> &quot;every once in awhile to see which ones are obviously bought and paid for.&quot;</p>

<p>So, we have a user who stalks <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> mod profiles and comments on 4-day old thread replies to antagonize them into arguments... for what? To harass me (and more importantly, <em>us</em>).</p>

<p>Almost overnight, threads in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TopMindsOfReddit/comments/7hzsui/if_i_wanted_to_doxx_you_i_would_have_moderator_of/">/r/topminds</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/7i0jrp/rconspiracy_mod_comes_to_blame_paid_shills_for/">/r/subredditdrama</a>, [/r/<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/C_S_T/comments/7i6on7/mods_of_this_subreddit_called_out_for_threatening/">C_S_T</a>, and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/undelete/comments/7hzw9i/if_i_wanted_to_doxx_you_i_would_have_moderator_of/">/r/undelete</a> and overnight my inbox became flooded with vitriol and comments in dead threads accusing me of threatening to doxx <a href="/u/LAAgg">/u/LAAgg</a>, when all I asked was how the weather was in LA after I was accused of working in Ukraine and being paid by the RNC. </p>

<p>Of note, my username isn&#39;t UkraineColesPardon, but their username is <a href="/u/LAAgg">/u/LAAgg</a> at the time of this posting. One of us was being rude, antagonistic, and appears (to me) to be filled with an agenda. One of us was responding to a bullshit quip. One may have been radicalized by subreddits that exist for the sole function of ridiculing users and harassing them. The other was responding to a dead thread.</p>

<p>The threads, half of which were posted by a 1-day old account, one by a mod of <a href="/r/TopMindsOfReddit">/r/TopMindsOfReddit</a> and the other by /r<a href="/u/Zarathustra">/u/Zarathustra</a> on <a href="/r/C_S_T">/r/C_S_T</a> accuse me - in <em>whipsaw</em> fashion - of threating to doxx a user when you take a look at the exchange in context, it was obviously a user who poked me in a dead thread for a response and created a 1 day-old account (unless you believe that one-day old accounts know enough about reddit and it&#39;s meta games to zero in on an incident such as this... it&#39;s just another example of the systemic harassment that I deal with on a daily and weekly  basis on this website while I volunteer my time to help moderate one of the more colorful subreddits (<a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>). And I say years, because since I have been a moderator at <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> I have received messages from various users (or one user with various accounts) with similar language tendancies and want it to be highlighted to further take the exchange above (and ensuing drama) in proper context. I also have sent this message to <a href="/u/gaazda">/u/gaazda</a>  and <a href="/u/zippylooda">/u/zippylooda</a> who are reviewing this set of incidents, as my user account was sanctioned for the above exchange.</p>

<p>Below is a somewhat brief timeline of harrassment by a group of (if not one bored, lonely user) accounts on reddit that bring us from about two years ago until today - with interesting posting patterns emphasized.</p>

<p>Please note that an identical post of this nature has been created linking to all threads here in their archived form and sent to the admins, most notably <a href="/u/gazzda">/u/gazzda</a>, as a long-term harrasment ticket was opened prior to me taking a break from reddit in November due to family issues (and what I hoped was a cooling down of the harrassment - of which you will all note has not stopped and picked up as soon as I resumed my reddit activity. In order to abide by site-wide rules (in contradiction to one of the threads linked below) I respect the rules of the site (and any Sub I participate in) to the best of my ability and encourage others to do so. Please follow all links to investigate any claims made in this post but try your best not to interact via commenting or voting if you can resist (and we both know you can).
It starts with a user, <a href="/u/thefuckingtoe">/u/thefuckingtoe</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/38ivk4/91101_truth_attacked_yet_again_on_rconspiracy/">here</a> <strong>two years ago</strong> with this comment when they first latched on to me. Of note, I do <strong>bold</strong> things for emphasis. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Jim, think critically for a moment. Cui bono? Who benefits from having 911 truth squashed <strong>on reddit.com?</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This seemingly innocuous link was brought to the fore <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/C_S_T/comments/4lv0si/how_to_get_the_revolution_started/d3rb6it/">one year ago</a> by a new account, <a href="/u/god-1-">/u/god-1-</a> calling me shady:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Your answer was to quell discussion. Oops, your emperor is showing! </p>

<p>*Private company&#39;s thought police alert</p>

<p>You&#39;re the same <em>guy</em> who tells reddit users to stop focusing on 911 because it is in the past.</p>

<p>You are very shady.
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/C_S_T/comments/4m80s2/cst_why_does_your_lead_moderator_ignore_csts_rules/d3tdngp/">Here</a> <a href="/u/god-1-">/u/god-1-</a> gets more specific:</p>

<p>Your gatekeeper is part of the problem fellow redditors. The people attacking my message and defending the <strong>thought police</strong> (moderators) dont&#39; want a revoultion, based on the instructions from their masters. In some cases, the masters are actually moderators, using sock puppet accounts to hide their true identity.</p>

<p>This user then changes accounts again and comes at me as <a href="/u/usa-911-mastermind">/u/usa-911-mastermind</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/4p5dm9/image_hosting_on_reddit/d4ibnj8/">here</a> on <a href="/r/announcements">/r/announcements</a> (note that we&#39;re not in the strange dregs of reddit here - but this journey spans years and multiple subreddits with no escape from the harassment as the user accounts are easily creatable and as long as you can be pinged with a username shoutout you will be notified of any toxicity. But I digress:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>When&#39;s the last time you saw a user mention reddit.com specifically? Have you ever? Movin&#39; on.</p>

<p>In a post in <a href="/r/C_S_T">/r/C_S_T</a> a year ago complaining of moderators being controlled (there&#39;s a theme here) user <a href="/u/-no-god">/u/-no-god</a> invokes <a href="/u/thefuckingtoe">/u/thefuckingtoe</a>&#39;s username again (connecting the accounts) and shares with us <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/C_S_T/comments/5awp0g/the_mods_of_rconspiracy_are_controlled/d9kpq7">this gem</a>:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>On the <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> board, now as <a href="/u/ftheec">/u/ftheec</a>, I get accused again of being an alt of another conspiracy moderator <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/5y7x8n/aclu_emerges_as_main_trump_antagonist/deoed9x/">here</a>:</p>

<p>We kept the fire going in <a href="/u/ConspiracyII">/u/ConspiracyII</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ConspiracyII/comments/688cm6/some_insight/dgwjd2x/">here</a> accusing me of being a disinformation shill. We are also using <a href="/u/smartwater-">/u/smartwater-</a> now, for what it&#39;s worth.</p>

<p>About a month ago, on <a href="/r/doctorwho">/r/doctorwho</a>, <a href="/u/iloveredditt">/u/iloveredditt</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/76opoy/oooooooooooooo/doipykm/">here</a> accusing <a href="/u/RJ_Ramrod">/u/RJ_Ramrod</a> of being an alt of myself and <a href="/u/AssuredlyAThrowaway">/u/AssuredlyAThrowaway</a> (another conspiracy moderator).</p>

<p>It gets especially fun when again, in <a href="/r/undelete">/r/undelete</a>, <a href="/u/iloveredditt">/u/iloveredditt</a> goes on a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/undelete/comments/76ylhw/rnews_article_on_russian_bribery_to_democrats/dom02b1/">tirade</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m not the amazing &#39;thefuckingtoe.&#39; I&#39;m not even sure how you would get that - I mean, everyone else who is silenced for highlighting moderator corruption slinks away, all defeatist-like, just like &#39;thefuckingtoe&#39; it would seem.</p>

<p>From my limited understanding, based on searches, he pointed out moderator corruption. The mods have the final say on if their rule 10 &#39;fee-fees&#39; are hurt. BTW, good time to bring up you distracting the election with rule 6 violation bullshit while you and all moderators abuse rule 10 to silence any NON-REDDITNARRATIVE you choose. Good play there, it was really well thought out, as a disinformation narrative. Speaking of disinformation narratives, shall we?</p>

<p>No you dumb shill - it all started with <a href="/u/axolotl_peyotl">/u/axolotl_peyotl</a> (disinfo shill extraordinaire) staging a fake AMA that hurt the 9-11 movement. <strong>I&#39;ve been &quot;moose-pilling&quot; conspiracy theorists on the shill mod team,</strong> who also runs TMOR! Gotta control both narratives.</p>

<p>Jesus fucking titty Christ crackduck, is this going to be the time where you insist alts are against Reddit&#39;s TOS?</p>

<p>signed - I&#39;m Finishing my coffee</p>

<p>Now I get why thefuckingtoe was banned (unless you discount the part where flytape says he was banned for being an &#39;unforgiving cunt of a user&#39; - <strong>I&#39;m a moose archive if you will)</strong></p>

<p>With me?</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s cute. But this weird Tombstone stuff is contagious!</p>

<p>In <a href="/r/television">/r/television</a>, <a href="/u/iiloveredditt">/u/iiloveredditt</a> accused <a href="/u/32OrtonEdge32dh">/u/32OrtonEdge32dh</a> of being one of my alts, as well as <a href="/u/polkadotgirl">/u/polkadotgirl</a> and <a href="/u/liverpoolwin">/u/liverpoolwin</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/7avso5/jimmy_fallons_mother_dies_in_nyc_hospital/dplan3x/">here</a>.

<p>Enter: <a href="/u/jhdulles">/u/jhdulles</a> - the OP of the <a href="/r/undelete">/r/undelete</a> and <a href="/r/TopMindsofReddit">/r/TopMindsofReddit</a> threads linked above. It&#39;s an account that was registered on reddit days ago, and was allowed to post for three consecutive days the same link (with <a href="/u/cojoco">/u/cojoco</a> removing the third-day-in-a-row self post for spam, not harrassment, despite what reddit&#39;s guidelines on user harrassment are.) I especially liked how you defended the second spam posting, <a href="/u/cojoco">/u/cojoco</a>, as being &#39;fit for the sub.&#39; Of note this user has also pointed their attention on our current top <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> mod in <a href="/r/undelete">/r/undelete</a> as of a week ago.</p>

<p>Either way, we have a few interesting things that need to be noted with <a href="/u/jhdulles">/u/jhdulles</a>. There are a few language choices that are oddly specific, namely these two exchanges:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/undelete/comments/7hzw9i/if_i_wanted_to_doxx_you_i_would_have_moderator_of/dqvnxhg/">Here</a> <a href="/u/jhdulles">/u/jhdulles</a> calls out <a href="/u/Balthanos">/u/Balthanos</a> - another <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> moderator in the following exchange:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m sure <strong>reddit.com</strong> Admins appreciate a moderator threatening doxx against a redditor!</p>

<p>Gotta stick up for your co-moderators at <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>... fox guarding henhouse</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Such a focus on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> moderators! Where have I heard that before?
And there&#39;s also this <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/undelete/comments/7hzw9i/if_i_wanted_to_doxx_you_i_would_have_moderator_of/dqvvwrn/">here</a> where he taunts me that I haven&#39;t deleted my so-called doxx threat yet:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>James&#39; doxx threat is still visible for all to report as a violation of reddit TOS.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Who&#39;s your huckleberry?</strong></p>

<p>Interesting Tombstone reference, 3-day old account. </p>

<p>That brings us back to <a href="/u/_Ph03niX">/u/_Ph03niX</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TopMindsOfReddit/comments/7gzu0m/we_are_responsible_for_the_most_stupid_stuff_in/dqnc9eh/">here</a> where he helps us put it all together:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Well, I and my pals got started <strong>about 2 years ago now.</strong> We tried to help the /con goons, but to no avail. They seem to like things precisely how they are. As far as Queen Bee goes, that is of my own doing. They would have never branched off if I didn&#39;t supposedly &quot;go off the rails&quot; in participating here in this sub. I don&#39;t give a shit, my mission is far larger and more just than these feelgood cultists can even fathom.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not going anywhere until various goals are met, and it has very little to do with my sub. They WILL be met, and my time investment will have payoff. I&#39;ll beat the shit out of people until 2030 if that&#39;s what it takes.</p>

<p>These easily led fools are incapable of thinking bigger, which is why I&#39;ll win. I&#39;ve always been ahead, they just didn&#39;t know it. For shame I say, because I/we gave them a chance. <strong>Now we play for blood, Johnny Ringo.</strong></p>

<p>I&#39;m not going anywhere.</p>

<p>Cowards.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracyundone/comments/7io73n/thoughts_on_this/dr0jm7l/">here</a> we have actual threats </p>

<blockquote>
<p>mentioned that I&#39;ve been here a long time. Do you think that I haven&#39;t made some admin connections in that period?</p>

<p>You threatened to doxx me. If I so desired, all of your accounts would be scrubbed and a VPN wouldn&#39;t help you. Rather, I&#39;ll go ahead and decimate you with the tools and people I have available.</p>

<p>It&#39;s better this way; optics and all.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll fuck you silly and leave you to wallow in your own filth.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, what&#39;s more likely? A concerted effort by one user, or a group of users, to conspire and to harass and intimidate another user on reddit for a minimum of 2 years, with coordinated efforts in a subreddit where I am banned (<a href="/r/TopMindsOfReddit">/r/TopMindsOfReddit</a>, which is dedicated to ridiculing, linking, brigading and cyberbullying users on reddit who disagree with them) despite not breaking any of their rules in their sub, allowing me no recourse to refute any statements and powerless to address any user-pings which continue unabated, for at least two years now. 
A user, <a href="/u/LAAgg">/u/LAAgg</a>, possibly a consumer of <a href="/r/TopMindsOfReddit">/r/TopMindsOfReddit</a> content, has been radicilized by clickbait, whipsaw content posted to <a href="/r/TopMindsOfReddit">/r/TopMindsOfReddit</a>, has convinced xim/xer that I am somehow an RNC plant and an Ukrainian agent, which means I must be monitored in real time at all times. Any comment I make in any subreddit at any time will be met with hostile quips and borderline aggressive, threatening behavior, (as I detailed above) - and when I respond with asking how the weather is in LA, because it&#39;s the first two letters of their username, I&#39;m accused of being doxxy and stalky, despite the user in question admitting to the exact same behavior.</p>

<p>I&#39;d like to also thank <a href="/u/_Ph03niX">/u/_Ph03niX</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TopMindsofReddit/comments/7lcxsb/con_mod_jamescolespardon_says_hes_going_to_resign">here</a> for posting a link to this thread 13 minutes after I posted in this sub (I mean really dude it was a Thursday afternoon how stalky can you be) and then user <a href="/u/Stricktlybutters">/u/Stricktlybutters</a> posting in <a href="/r/Drama">/r/Drama</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Drama/comments/7lhqxt/male_fragility_poster_goy_and_mod_of_rconspiracy/">here</a> for predictably exhibiting my point. Thats for the Sticky, too. A nice touch.</p>

<p>Finally - my suggestion.</p>

<p>I propose to revoke Rule 9 in it&#39;s entirety and encourage all users that subscribe here to simply /block <a href="/r/TopMindsOfReddit">/r/TopMindsOfReddit</a> and any user who mentions you or you see exhibiting targetted behavior. If administrators feel that this behavior is tolerated and encouraged (as they obviously do - since no disciplincary action has been taken that can be seen at this point, compared to deleting my nonthreat as it was minscontstrued as something it was not - we must take matters into our own hands, and simply ignore them. </p>

<p>They will move on to other subs, and slowly turn into an anti-<a href="/r/The_Donald">/r/The_Donald</a> sub (it&#39;s already starting) and they will just fade into a dead sub as the users move on and the moderators eventually grow up. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well now I&#39;m not glad I found cell signal down in the hollar. </p>

<p>It&#39;s been real. I completely understand where you are coming from. Just last week I sent a report to the admins and received a similar response. Ironically, it appears we are treated as sub-human on this site when levying complaints against certain individuals.</p>

<p>If this type of behavior was happening in the workplace it wouldn&#39;t be tolerated due to fear of legal retaliation or monetary compensation. It&#39;s disgusting that we&#39;re expected to just ignore clear bullying and harrassment.</p>

<p>This job is rarely rewarding and requires a lot of personal time. Thick skin can only go so far in lessening the blows of a daily onslaught of negativity. I empathize with you and stand behind your decision to keep your family and personal life first.</p>

<p>I salute you and thank you for all the hard work you&#39;ve contributed during your tenure. It should go without saying that if you ever need a friend my ear is always available.</p>

<p>Godspeed my friend.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I dunno if that is <em>the</em> goal, but it is <em>a</em> goal. And trust me, there could be no better trick to them than getting a mod to get so frustrated by TMOR that they quit. There has gotta be some kinda massive payout at shillplanet for that kind of trick. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t find it, seems it was around the time leaks were coming out about David Brock, some mentions of NSA leveraging tools to suppress data.  While many mods are basic lifeguards keeping the sub&#39;s waters clean, JCP is both a mod and a sharer of data.  I find his posts wise and CST thrives off of that wisdom.  </p>

<p>He might not be on the top of the thought leader list, I&#39;d guess his being a mod bumps his score up to be a qualified target.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hmm, I just realized this particular crazy person has latched onto me as well. The day I became a mod I started getting PMs from him saying I was JCP. Then, I think a week or so ago, I had a guy, I think iloveredditt, latch on in an <a href="/r/AskReddit">/r/AskReddit</a> thread, saying the same shit, maybe even a Tombstone ref. I reported them to the admins a couple times in that thread (which I never do), but it was bizarre. I thought they were just insane, but now I am doubting that. They were maybe too good at being nuts.</p>

<p>Funny thing is, I can&#39;t find anything in my comment history if I sort by AskReddit. Maybe I am doing it wrong though?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are a mod of a sub that accommodates political brigading from various subs that have a political agenda.  It doesn&#39;t matter what you do to topminds, it won&#39;t stop people from &quot;defaming&quot; you.  You&#39;re basically the ref in a football game.  You should expect people to piss on you when you don&#39;t make a call the way they think you should.  If this is more than you can take in stride then I suggest you not subject yourself to it at all. </p>

<p>One solution would be to banish all contemporary political conspiracies to another sub dedicated specifically to that.  Partisan politics has absoultely taken over this sub and is driving away the base that has supported this sub for so long.  Do you really want to trade that base for the toxic brigadiers from t_D and politics?  Because they won&#39;t last.  The political landscape will change, they will leave, and you&#39;ll be left with a ghost town. </p>

<p>Hopefully the admins will read this and realise that their tacit endorsement of TMOR&#39;s &quot;hate &amp; harassment&quot; programme reflects badly on reddit and their administration of it.</p>

<p>We could certainly request that admins curtail TMOR&#39;s tactic of making constant username mentions of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> users (and mods) since the purpose of those messages are simply to throw insults at us. </p>

<p>I just checked my inbox to count the number of username mention messages I have received in the last two weeks from TMOR commenters - it was 16 - most of which were just to tell me I was &quot;insane&quot;. Their objective is to suck you into the cesspit, to get you to try to justify yourself on their territory, but that is only ever going to go one way, so I ignore them, as everyone here should. These hateful little people are not worth your time.</p>

I&#39;m sure some random person who wasn&#39;t in the circle jerk there saw that post, hopefully, and was like &quot;OH YEAH ILL SHOW THIS GUY WRONG&quot; and then whenever he researched it fucking realized that I was right - I mean unless you&#39;re a shill - aka being paid because you know the truth to lie - then I believe that there is definitely reason to convince you based upon strong evidence - some are so blinded by their mentalities - but not all - some of them in there - if not all of them - really need our help if anything too</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I set out thinking it would be fairly easy to debunk pizzagate as a 4chan / Donald alt-right hoax. It wasn&#39;t easy. I wondered why the accusations against CPP started at least a decade ago if this was just election year trolling. I wondered why this story seemed to fit in perfectly with my model of abuse of power and the hidden history of cult infiltration / intelligence operations. I wondered why Alefantis frequently &quot;jokes&quot; about being a cannibal and child rapist. I wondered why our fearless muckraking corporate journalists just asked him if his feelings were hurt and suppressed the details of the accusations. </p>

<p>In other words the evidence changed my mind. I looked deeper. Are you guys on board with that concept?</p>

<p>I cannot rewind the last year. I cannot forget &quot;Majestic Ape&quot; and the absolutely disgusting stuff he says. Etc. This shit is real folks, no amount of name calling and shaming can make us forget.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for attesting, yes. Facts&gt;Fiction - Reality&gt;Fiction </p>

<p>I think any person who&#39;s on the other side uses logic like the rest of us and is trapped within the &quot;appeal to authority&quot; brainwashing programmed since birth. Aka, Trust Gov, Trust Media, WHO is Good, FDA is Good, all impossible to corrupt. So whenever they see the masses of people and masses of &quot;good&quot; TV shows saying stuff, they simply fall into that logical line, nonetheless more evidence pushes that way out the window. But you need to escape your box first... You need to research the franklin scandal, detroux case, the bushes and crowley, etc etc. Then you&#39;ll see why the Creative Artist Agency (largest acting and sports agency on earth) has an illuminati eye built directly into it&#39;s layout... as they do everything fucking else... DC from above... Austraila - it&#39;s endless... </p>

<p>On the plus, this means they&#39;re basically incrementally banning their own user base, which means this site is on its last legs.</p>

People who never posted a link in their life scream that your comment didn&#39;t have citations every ten words. They demand instant proof, you tell them where to go to get started looking for themselves and that&#39;s the end of the conversation. Meanwhile they have little evidence that we can trust our institutions to be fair and accurate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Forgot to add- conspiracy must be the hardest mod job on the site, it&#39;s a trial by fire and the ones who last are no fools no matter how much flak they take in and out of the sub. </p>

<p>Because of that, I have to think JCP wouldn&#39;t have dealt with the admins in a case like this without documenting his own actions and reports in order to show that he took the right steps in response to being targeted. In other words seems logical that JCP has evidence of admin incompetence and probably worse. </p>

<p>I think that seeing the supporting evidence would be positive for the sub, even opposing groups here (for lack of a less dramatic term) would find it unifying, as no one who&#39;s here in good faith wants to see the admins selectively applying rules any more than they already do.  So is it reasonable to think that OP has real evidence but also good reasons to not reveal it yet? </p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="/u/JamesColesPardon">/u/JamesColesPardon</a>, the Top Minds of Reddit brigade attack mods to attack their subs. Destroy the mods, destroy the sub, take over the sub. The Top Minds of Reddit brigade forces their targets to post solely in their own sub (eco chamber). They accomplish this by infiltrating the subs the mods posts in, bullying and discrediting the mods, downvote brigading and report as spam brigading the mods&#39; posts. The mods of those subs do not know nonsubscribers are voting and report as spam brigading. Mods misbelieve their own subscribers do not like the posts. The mods react by removing the posts, banning the OPs, refusing to disclose to OPs whether their posts were reported as spam and refusing to report to the admins report as spam brigading. Reddit should display reports as spam to everyone, not just to mods. OPs and subscribers do not know which posts were reported as spam brigaded.</p>

<p>Censorship by TMOR causes other subs to remain ignorant of the echo chamber. Then Top Mods of Reddit ban evade, infiltrate, vote brigade and report as spam brigade the eco chamber. <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is an extremely large echo chamber with lots of mods to protect it. I recommend stay as a mod and stay in this echo chamber.</p>

<p>Mods of small subs targeted by the Top Minds of Reddit brigade have a much more difficult time. The brigade attempts to take over small subs and have succeeded doing so:</p>

<p>Of course not. Why the fuck does anyone here expect <em>not</em> to be abused, gang-stalked, and threatened? We&#39;re trying to tell the truth about those that have <em>murdered millions of innocent people</em>. There&#39;s going to be push back before we finally win the information war.</p>

<p>The admins&#39; reticence in sanctioning TMOR does point that way. Perhaps not to the extent that they &quot;run&quot; TMOR, but I would be very surprised if some the mods there are not admin alts.</p>

And then we also have a 7 day wait period for new accounts, so anything a brand new user posts will have to be manually approved or else it stays invisible.

    <div class="md"><p>The thing here is that while I&#39;m interested in conspiracy theories, a vast majority of them, and the people who propagate them, seem to be completely insane and refuse to believe facts because they &quot;see the truth&quot;, while calling people who don&#39;t buy their delusions &quot;shills&quot; for disagreeing.</p>

<p>The problem is that the mentally ill and the paranoid schizophrenics among us tend to see something that resonates, dig deeper, then lose their minds and start having these delusions of being harassed and that &quot;the government/MSM/whatever&quot; is &quot;out to get&quot; them or &quot;lying&quot; at all times.</p>

<p>They have no desire to listen to reason. It&#39;s just dismissive and only reflects badly on them for doing it. I saw a comment further down saying to &quot;ban them and their sock puppets&quot;. Is that a reasonable suggestion to you? Not to me, as a sane, mature adult. That kind of thing equates to banning free speech and freedom of thought.</p>

<p>I know that sub does the same to people from here but I can see why they would, considering people here have this delusion that only they know the truth and then spew these random, bullshit theories that make no sense before acting superior because &quot;I know the truth&quot;, when their &quot;truth&quot; is just bullshit from a clickbait site called &quot;unlocktheparadigm.net&quot; or whatever, with no verified sources, just random delusions with no facts whatsoever.</p>

<p>If people here would discuss and debate things without sounding like immature, delusional children who don&#39;t know how to talk without calling other people shills for not sharing their weird opinions and assuming the world is out to get them, or using factless sources for their theories that appeal to their grand, paranoid thoughts, maybe that sub wouldn&#39;t act the way it does?</p>

<p>Maybe think about that?</p>

<p>Then again, why <em>wouldn&#39;t</em> people who are paranoid that oxygen is a CIA-invented thing to kill off people who look like Gary Busey have a persecution complex?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>that sucks that you&#39;ve been targeted and it&#39;s having an effect.  i think you&#39;re right to remove yourself from stuff like that if it&#39;s making your life more difficult.</p>

<p>all of that said - this problem isn&#39;t going to go away by running away from it.  the truth is that in an environment of free speech people are going to disagree.  and the ability for groups to coalesce and target their energy on other people will exist.  that&#39;s just a natural consequence.  </p>

<p>what i would suggest, since this stalky behaviour isn&#39;t just unique to you and affects many others, is that we all work together to help each other out.  we need more audit and meta services.  we need to be able to record abusive behaviour and categorize it.  we need to track the accounts of abusers.  we need to show others what&#39;s going on.  these are services that will help anyone in a similar position.  to ensure that we have a decent respectful environment we all need to come together.  there&#39;s loads of nerdy talent here that can facilitate it.  and there&#39;s no reason why people like yourself should be burdened singularly with fixing it.  we can fix it together.  i would rather we do that.</p>

<p>in terms of how the admins here are gonna help you or not help you - i wouldn&#39;t expect ANY help from them.  they don&#39;t give a shit about that except when it&#39;s convenient for them.  they have a history of that.  and i don&#39;t think that&#39;s going to change.</p>

<p>so my suggestion is this - have a roundtable discussion on how to make life easier for people who find themselves harassed for being here.  we can face this together.  whatever platform discussions like this are on, these problems will exist.  ignore the platform, embrace the community.  it&#39;ll serve everybody well. </p>

<p>Also reddit downvotes can be abused to keep good information away from the front pages that voat protects against better. Also the owner of reddit admitted to altering political posts to suit his personal views so yeah there is that 2.</p>

<p>Voat allows real news to be shared.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess you can&#39;t really do it as mod, but changing accounts every few months is refreshing.

<p>I&#39;ve been complaining about this website since 2011, sadly, there&#39;s no other website with this level of discussion. If someone can make a better website without the malicious echo-chamber effects, it could save the world.</p>

<p>And not a crude rip-off like Voat, which is an even worse echo chamber. It&#39;s not &quot;diversity of ideas&quot; over there, it&#39;s just segregation. The flaw is in the voting/karma system.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, I watched it. It&#39;s is rife with generalizations and labels collectively trying to squeeze &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot; into 1 personality type, which is an extremely paranoid person that thinks literally everything is a conspiracy. That is not the personality type of this subreddit, besides maybe a minute fraction of the users. There&#39;s much more nuance here.</p>

<p>Why did you link me this? Is this your justification for making fun of a paranoid person? Don&#39;t ever link me a psychology video again, they have their heads so far up their asses it&#39;s ridiculous. It&#39;s a made up &quot;medical&quot; field praying on weak people for anything outside of actual disorders that can be physically shown, like schizophrenia. This jerkoff saying what he knows about &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot; as if that&#39;s something that can be physically shown is just a bunch of bullshit psychobabble.</p>

<p>Oh for sure. but there is no effort to stop both of them. T_D posters have free reign on this sub and anyone who opposes Trump has to choose their words VERY carefully.

<p>People aren&#39;t &quot;from&quot; subreddits or causes, they are individuals. Get a little more complex in your thinking please. Do you want to ban people for posting on other forums while speculating about possible bans here?</p>

<p>If someone is an active member in one part of reddit and only goes to another sub to cause trouble, well there&#39;s a reason why that&#39;s bad and why those rules are in place. It still doesn&#39;t make them from somewhere like subs are hometowns.</p>

<p>TMOR is a harassment sub, period. So it&#39;s a false equivalency to compare them to forums where people actually discuss topics. Membership there is a bit different since it&#39;s all about deliberate, coordinated trolling.</p>

<p>Notice I am not calling for a particular plan of action here, just making points.</p>

<p>Because you want the perception to seem like you&#39;re being attacked.

<p>Grow up and pay attention to the bigger picture here, because I don&#39;t see how anyone could be ignorant enough to believe that the shitload of anti-Trump subreddits, the political humor and blackpeopletwitter takeover, the creation of multiple conspiracy subs (hidden and Public) just to find a space to actively monitor a conspiracy that they are interested in are a natural progression for this site or an example of one party controlling most of the subs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is just sad. </p>

<p>I forget TMOR exists until someone brings it up. Then again I&#39;m not harassed because I&#39;m not a blatant Trump supporter and partisan right winger trying to control the subs narratives. </p>

<p>What did you guys do during the conspirtard days? People were made fun of and harassed then too. </p>

<p>This is just another artificial boogeyman that doesn&#39;t matter. The only boogeyman that matters is the U.S government and its war machine. Comments can literally be ignored. I got right wingers in this sub constantly attacking me instead of the arguments, I don&#39;t get a sticky post or even a slight feeling of grief from a partisan right wing moderator. </p>

<p>Leaving over whatever it is they do is weak. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Any and all subs that dare to speak out against the &quot;accepted&quot; narrative are being heavily brigaded right now. I think the name and subject matter of this sub makes it particularly easy to attack due to the taboo around &quot;conspiracy theories.&quot; I&#39;m sure the rising hostility in this sub can be traced back to sometime in 2016, say when a certain whistleblowing organization started releasing certain people&#39;s emails. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think any of us that are interested in the truth and gov&#39;t transparency are safe from harassment anymore. Some of us welcome that fight but still need to take a break from time to time to be reminded that we are not alone and most importantly, we are not wrong.</p>

<p>I&#39;m a regular at <a href="/r/WayOfTheBern">/r/WayOfTheBern</a> which is how I came upon this post. We are a small community but grow every day since we&#39;re one of the last places that encourages political discourse and speaking truth to power. We, and our mods, have also been targeted by SmallMindsOfReddit and I hate to see them succeed in driving rational voices away from the conversation. Please consider visiting (and posting!) in our community. </p>

<p>A warning though if you care much about your karma: comments and posts (even posts about baked goods lol) are regularly downvoted by Brockroaches and Trumpbots. Apparently we shatter too many rose-colored glasses when we reach r/all. =D</p>

<p>In solidarity, Onward!     </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The internet is a cesspool of trolls who take their real world frustrations out on people online, behind the veil of anonymity of course, otherwise they&#39;d get shit kicked to within an inch of their lives, I&#39;m sure. I mean just think about what would happen if they harassed people the way they do, IRL! It would not be pretty. Its sort of like how people all of a sudden get tough when they&#39;re behind the wheel of a car, protected by the glass and metal. They flip people off and yell and scream, but take away that protective layer and they&#39;d be shitting bricks. </p>

<p>So with all that said, who gives a shit. They&#39;re real life COWARDS. If the elite ever decide to just try and take this bitch, these people will be crying for our help.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sure most harassers don&#39;t have much of a life. I try to ignore them and focus on the people who enrich my life instead. I&#39;m pretty new here, but it looks like you have a lot of support on this sub. Still, sometimes we do have to step back and take a break from the BS for our own mental health, as some people remind me of elementary school--looking for individuals to target for the slightest things for their own entertainment and to bolster their low self-esteem. Just wait until you&#39;re old. Ageism is very real and you have to deal with little snot-nosed assholes even more often because of that bias. I&#39;m at the point in my life where retirement is coming up, and I&#39;ll be moving with my family AWAY from people. Just tired of so many people having no manners or respect for others. The reflection is on them--not you. Hang in there. I&#39;ve found the reality is that there are really more people who are willing to listen to what you have to say and are kind, even if they disagree. The trolls are just more annoying and they tend to run in packs, like wolves. It shows they never matured emotionally past some pre-pubescent point in their lives. Sad, but there is nothing you can do about their behavior.  </p>

<p>where the harassment like a badge of honor my friend if anything it should reassure you are thinking freely because your bumping in to the side of the cage they are trying to keep us in.</p>

<p>every time i warrant harassment i double down, because its a great indicator they see you as a threat. revel in that, because it tells you that some one else fears you enough to try and silence you.</p>

<p>people here just need to learn to approach things differently now that we know how bad the attempt to push the narratives are. assume everything is bullshit from the outset. assume it is a lie until you do your own research because by my estimates 70-80% of the content here is manufactured to derail the 20-30% of real user posts.</p>

<p>Remember r/isconspiracyracist?
They would repost and try to shame users that said something they perceived as racist. The problem was their kinda stupid, so they Made the mistake of not realizing everyone doesn&#39;t think like them. Every Nazi here was happy he was being reposted and jumped over there to elaborate and expound on his beliefs in the comments.lol. no one was shamed at all!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This kind of garbage makes me really appreciate /pol/ and 4chan in general. If only /pol/ weren&#39;t seemingly filled with white supremacists and the incel attitude.</p>

<p>Not that I&#39;d want /pol/ to become censored, I&#39;d just prefer to talk with <em>like minded</em> people in an uncensored setting. The rest of 4chan is pretty great.</p>

<p>I wonder if those types of people are attracted to /pol/ due to the freedom of speech, or rather that it&#39;s the only place they can speak their minds without getting banned.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Forgot to add- conspiracy must be the hardest mod job on the site, it&#39;s a trial by fire and the ones who last are no fools no matter how much flak they take in and out of the sub. </p>

<p>Because of that, I have to think JCP wouldn&#39;t have dealt with the admins in a case like this without documenting his own actions and reports in order to show that he took the right steps in response to being targeted. In other words seems logical that JCP has evidence of admin incompetence and probably worse. </p>

<p>I think that seeing the supporting evidence would be positive for the sub, even opposing groups here (for lack of a less dramatic term) would find it unifying, as no one who&#39;s here in good faith wants to see the admins selectively applying rules any more than they already do.  So is it reasonable to think that OP has real evidence but also good reasons to not reveal it yet? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its so incredibly one sided. Pizzagate and T_D are famous for doxxing. for fucks sake one of them tracked down who i was on my old account because I spoke against trump here. Yet we never hear about it here.</p>

<p>I was told its just the internet and stop being so sensitive but apparently if someone makes fun of you on another subreddit its the end of the fucking earth.</p>

<p>and of course this turned into a cry for censorship. Its blatantly obvious that this thread is designed to allow the banning of people who don&#39;t agree with the agenda being pushed by the mods. </p>

<p>Here is whats going to happen. There will be a rule change where a few people from some subs will be banned on sight because of &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;targeted harassment&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot; then more subs. Then the mod will decide hes not resigning because of the rule change. then more subs will banned. And suddenly only Donald Trump worship will be allowed here. Its so damn  blatant </p>
