    <div class="md"><p>I have learned there is no profound reason for when their physical forms visit us. They are essentially explorers, and we fascinate them. Because they cannot communicate with most of us in the way they commonly communicate, they physically come here to study us. It&#39;s as simple as that. They completely understand our physical forms, our bodies, our DNA, etc. It&#39;s our consciousness, or rather, the limited consciousness we have that intrigues them.</p>

<p>An admittedly bad example is if humans were looking at house flies. They appear to have little consciousness, and little (or no) ability to communicate with each other. And, that being so, they don&#39;t do much except fly around, eat, shit, and fuck. Can you imagine, however, if house flies, despite having little consciousness and no communication methods, had built incredibly complex cities, the way humans have? It would mystify us. This is how the aliens view us. Because, in their way of understanding, we have little to no method of communication, they find it fascinating that we have managed to create what we have.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a specific narrative floating around that more or less describes just that. They refer to it/us as &#39;The Grand Experiment&#39; allegedly, the specific details are sort of vague and if you dig into it you end up in some weird places. You&#39;ll see claims like, certain groups of entities/beings started tinkering with humans and ended up becoming karmically involved in a way where our fate is directly bound to their own. Allegedly, one needs to &#39;have skin the game&#39; as it were to join in the research and different groups have different competing agendas. </p>

<p>It&#39;s an interesting idea, but like I said, you get into weird places real quick, especially since some stories involve groupings of consciousness that exist outside of time space as we understand it and various alleged divine and universal laws governing what is and isn&#39;t allowable within the confines of the various projects that are claimed to be going on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You touched on one of my main problems with the direction the ET thing has been going in, I guess, since the law of one thing. The whole inter-dimensional light being, consciousness, angels caring for us and things like that, BS. It gets into areas that are all about belief rather than tangible facts. It gets religious. Religion always gets hierarchical and you have to accept authority figures that self appoint to follow made up rules. This is dangerous because human beings are emotionally susceptible to these things and it always ends up with a group claiming superiority and getting violent or, at the very least, marginalizing “non-believers”. Don’t believe? Die. Don’t follow our beliefs? You get punished/shunned. It’s divisive. It’s manipulative. It’s yet more bullshit meant to control the population.  </p>

The Noah promise was a result of their coming to this understanding, so, since then, they&#39;ve sent teachers and tried to help us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Love when i see people on r/conspiracy speaking like what they’re saying is fact. Toss in some “i believe”’s or “my thought is” because truly it just makes you sound insane and that’s coming from someone who is constantly looking out of the rabbit hole i’m in. But this demonic shit is honestly just an outrageous stretch to everyone else unless you’re religious. If you aren’t and use basic intuition it’s quite easy to see past you statement w little to no ground in it. Demonic entities from a dimension we can’t see? Oof man.
