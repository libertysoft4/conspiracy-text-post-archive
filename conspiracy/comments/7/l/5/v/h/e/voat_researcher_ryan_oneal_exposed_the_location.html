It&#39;s my understanding that many of you have yet to see this, so I figured it would be a good idea to post this first for context. <strong>Go to 7:20 if you simply can&#39;t be bothered with the rest of the video. The front of the row of buldings near property (google earth view), is spraypainted &quot;Kids&quot; with an arrow pointing down.</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/DnT9QzmMAe4">https://youtu.be/DnT9QzmMAe4</a></p>

<p>Now, here is Ryan&#39;s (one of the most active and respected users on Voat), account of the events that transpired AFTER James found out about the post linking to his Pegasus Museum property.</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/qBn7ja_oegM">https://youtu.be/qBn7ja_oegM</a></p>

<p>&quot;I will kill your wife, your son, your mom, and I will sue your dead body&quot; - a paraphrase of what JA said to Ryan IF didn&#39;t remove the post. </p>

<hr/>

<p>How many innocent people do you know, who would flip out and threaten to kill somebody who exposed one of their properties? Was James Alefantis up to something nefarious? </p>

<p>Also, Ryan filed a police report after this threat. </p>

There&#39;s evidence for it. </p>

<p>Please, I&#39;m asking you to show me how public pizzagate it is right now. Since according to you that&#39;s what triggered you to come here. What you&#39;re saying doesn&#39;t even make sense Jane Doe. </p>

<p>What witch hunts have carried over in to the real world? The shooter than went there was a hoax flat out, the guy even had an IMBD profile. You&#39;re saying you&#39;ve all been here... but you&#39;re waiting for this to spill in to the real world. So I&#39;m back at what I said, pizzagate is not a public issue. The claim being made that you&#39;re here as a reaction to it affecting the real world doesn&#39;t make sense to me. Since the brave defenders of John Podesta only showed up after users point out that his emails have a lot more than a few mentions of UFOs. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You spent an awful lot of time attacking something you think is so logically false. Whats the point here, you aren&#39;t going to change the minds of people who have seen that it&#39;s true. You&#39;re calling Pizzagate mind control? It&#39;s not even in the public realm, I&#39;m sure you understand what mind control is right? It&#39;s being able to get someone to believe something so concretely that they do not question the official narrative and attack all others. </p>

<p>Pizzagate is the narrative being attacked the fact that fake news was coined for it should tell you how dangerous sifting through that information is. The term fake news was created to discredit this theory. Now you see, what many of us that believe and follow this theory have a huge problem with is that it&#39;s never been officially investigated. Except the DC Police Department that investigated nothing, claimed it was fake based on their initial decision that it was nothing. Despite gigabytes upon gigabytes of online evidence that warrants a further look, nothing was ever done. </p>

<p>So not only was this issue silenced by mislabeling it in the media, it was not investigated officially at all and any time this subject has been mentioned anywhere publicly outside of the massive shill effort by Megyn Kelly and Alex Jones its destroyed and ridiculed. This issue has never been in the public eye remember, despite the mounds of sound online evidence, despite the gigabytes of information collected, despite the fact that missing children dissapear in the area outside DC at a rate alarmingly higher than the rest of the country, despite claims from Haitian&#39;s that Hillary Clinton stole entire villages and ran an organ harvesting operation nothing has been done. </p>

<p>Then we come here, to Reddit and other online forums and once the issue reaches peak visibility the sub reddit is nuked due to doxxing. Fine, get rid of the sub. Then when the issue is posted here it is also visibly attacked to the point that they effectively disperse any conversation that would draw in the &quot;normies&quot; to sites like voat, 4chan and 8chan. On voat the site is regularly attacked, 4chan constant army of bots nukes the issue there too and I don&#39;t visit 8chan except CBTS because even 4chan is a risk click. </p>

<p>And now, seemingly out of nowhere, the issue is being assaulted anytime you are reminded that John Podesta&#39;s name is not synonymous with aliens or disclosure instead it is synonymous with vicious child molestation under the name of Skippy. </p>

<p>The very best part of this my friend, is that since I hold the truth and I know that I do there isn&#39;t anything you can do to stop it from spreading. </p>

<p>DO NOT CLICK THERE LINKS, all links they post are either pedo education, child porn which will control your mind instantly, or gaslighting videos that will capture you within 30 seconds with a huge lie that leaves you unable to tell truth from reality. </p>

<p>You will not get away with covering your tracks in this manner, they type in circles about &quot;evidence&quot; </p>

<p>These pizzagate investigators are the ultimate form and pedo educators and only seeks to recruits more into their ranks! Be careful! </p>

<p>A fox affiliate once showed a segment regarding pizzagate, in this he literally taught the pedo language and showed symbols for the pedos to look for, this is real. Large pedophiles movements are happening online and it&#39;s because of posters like this and we must stop the cycle!</p>

<p>We do not type in circles called evidence, all the evidence was pulled from instagram, facebook, their own public websites as well as publicly available information. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s a video by Ben Swann, shown live, legally since none of the information shown anywhere is child pornography. I don&#39;t store any of this information on my PC myself, since it&#39;s all publicly available online. That charge is ludicrous. </p>

<p>Seriously, don’t just DO NOTHING, if you think a kid is in danger the do the right thing otherwise stop spewing ignorance and hate. These people you claim to be evil are actual victims of this web you help to weave. </p>

<p>Forgive me, but this just comes off as you trying to control the minds of the viewers and lurkers, and discourage them for even looking into the information before they get a chance to. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve told you 3 times now, the pizza place in under investigation, Ryan reported this to the police, and CPP&#39;s child porn found on their password protected server has also been reported.</p>

<p>Maybe law enforcement sometimes protects powerful DC elites? Or is that too much of a pill for you to swallow...I mean, this is r/conspiracy after all.</p>

I think you should look to your morals and ask if you should take a positive action that may save a child.... you are claiming this is a “kill” room. I am from the DC area and work in the city, this is a proud city of color and local authorities are not afraid to stand up for justice unlike you. That is a pathetic argument honestly lol, tell me again how I should succumb to your fear mongering while you continue to post your how-to guide pedophiles to communicate in code</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In hindsight, &quot;lie&quot; was way too harsh a term, and I apologize. I wrongfully read your comments as being in agreement with OP that the behavior points to guilt. I think you were playing devils advocate, and I didn&#39;t quite get that.</p>

<p>Anyway, I didn&#39;t bring up the behavior-guilt/innocence link, the OP did. He finished his post by asking r/conspiracy, basically, &quot;do you think this is the behavior of an innocent man?&quot; And I replied that yes, it could be. So I don&#39;t have any flawed logic, I&#39;m playing devils advocate to the OP. You&#39;ve made it sound like pointing out logical flaws in the OP is itself a logical flaw, which makes me think you&#39;re misunderstanding the situation too </p>

<p>Ryan says he reported it to the police but again, you&#39;re just accepting his word.</p>

<p>As for why Alefantis hasn&#39;t sued, suing costs a lot of money. And a judge or jury may look at O&#39;Neill&#39;s videos and decide that, because he&#39;s just pushing an outlandish conpaircy theory, Alefantis&#39;s reputation has not been seriosuly damaged. (In that most people know pizzaagte is rubbish.) And so, he might not get awarded much. Also, there&#39;s the Streisand effect to consider.</p>

<p>In short, just because someone doesn&#39;t get sued does not mean they&#39;re telling the truth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The conspiracy itself is that there&#39;s a big sex trafficking ring that&#39;s connected with the government. Alefantis is one of their suppliers in the chain, allegedly. </p>

<p>It exists in the Catholic Church, it existed in the British government and still does yet is covered up. We know Dennis Hastert the former speaker of the house, and Jeff Epstein, the list goes on. There are legit concerns and it makes sense that these are covered up. </p>

<p>So forgive me when I find it fishy when there is not even a formal investigation into some very nefarious shit related to comet ping pong and pedo bands and pedo imagery on the Instagram, it was right out in the open.</p>

<p>And then there&#39;s you here saying &quot;oh gosh guys no need to look into this...&quot; what a tool. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course I&#39;ve seen the Intsagram pictures.

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Baseless accusations&quot;</p>

<p>There was never even an investigation. How about the guy who called the DC PD and they said the investigation was closed but the guy looked into it and there was never one done. </p>

<p>Could the Pedosta emails and the creepy art in the Pedosta house, and then being friends with convicted pedophile Dennis Hastert, and James alefantis Instagram and the Comet ping pong art and creepy tied up kids pics --- these could all be totally a coincidence. But it also couldn&#39;t be. </p>

<p>Believers in pizzagate want a real investigation and it makes it very peculiar when this is shut down prematurely without even looking into it, much like the Catholic Church sex scandals until one day it pops. </p>

<p>So I find your concern naive. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, they didn&#39;t say the investigation was closed. A media officer replied to an email from YouTuber Brian Rich saying there was no &quot;ongoing investigation regarding those false allegations headquartered at the comet ping pong restaurant&quot;. Rich then asked them how they could determine they were false if they hadn&#39;t investigated them. A media officer replied &quot;After investigating those claims, we have determined those allegations to be false.&quot; So, Rich filed an FOIA request for the investigation reports and an FOIA officer said they didn&#39;t conduct an investigation. So, yes, you could justifiably claim that a DC media officer lied about an investigation being conducted or you could also justifiably claim that a media officer just used &quot;investigating&quot; when they should have used &quot;reading&quot;. After all, the police deal with real child abuse and they don&#39;t have to conduct a formal investigation into pizzagate to see that it&#39;s bogus – they just have to spend an hour reading the &quot;evidence&quot; to see that it&#39;s baseless.</p>

<p>The Podesta emails are utterly unremarkable. I bet if you gave me access to thousands of your emails I could find words that I could replace with terms like &quot;little boy&quot; or &quot;little girl&quot; and then claim that proves you&#39;re a child abuser. That&#39;s what was done with Podesta&#39;s emails.</p>

<p>Tony Podesta didn&#39;t say he was friends with Hastert, he said he had kept in touch with him (and this was before the accusations of abuse were made public). And of course he would have kept in touch – Podesta was a political lobbyist and Hastert was a major political figure. He wouldn&#39;t have been much of a lobbyist if he didn&#39;t utilise his contacts. [Edit added:] And what about Donald Trump saying Epstein was a &quot;terrific guy&quot; and &quot;a lot of fun to be with&quot;? Why do pizzagaters make so much of Podesta keeping in contact with Hastert but deny that Trump knowing Epstein means anything?</p>

<p>James Alefantis&#39;s Instagram shows no criminal activity at all. There are no &quot;tied up kids pics&quot; – there is one picture of a happy looking, healthy looking child with her hands taped to a table.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Believers in pizzagate want a real investigation</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So go to the police of FBI and make a complaint. Have you done this? If not, why not?</p>

<p>I&#39;m okay with you finding my concern naive. I find those who believe in pizzagate gullible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>pizzagate is real and is bigger than we can see. If you go to youtube and search :sasha lord you will find a video of a girl who is the woman in charge of chosing the bands that play at comet ping pong, the woman looks like an actress who is reading a script,she even mentions that she worked for the girl scouts,orphanges and stuff like that. It really looks like a very fake video. It remind me of the video of Laura Silsby talking about that she was trying to help those kids in Haiti, what a lie... that woman was busted by trafficking kids in Haiti. There are videos of people in Haiti who protest against the Clinton fundation because they kidnapp the kids.. those videos are in another language are from local news and obviously have a low ranking of views.</p>

<p>Comet ping pong and those clinton orphange charities are defintely related.. what about the doctor who was murder that worked for one of clinton charities? what about chris cornell and chester benigton ?they were also conected with the clintons charities.</p>

<p>I used to be very skeptical about murder conspirancies but I think that there is something fishy out there.</p>

<p>I read the reviews about people that went to comet ping pong and a vast majority of people talks about the weird atmosphere in there,not a kids friendly place at all. People also mention how rude the waiter stuff is and that the place its always full of kids ith no parents around.The posters on the website of the restaurant that promote the bands are so weird.... look like a pattern for something if you pay close attention.
To me this restaurant probally is a cover of something pedo related for sure, maybe it is a place that it is used to blackmail important rich pedo people. Sorry,English is not my first language ...</p>

<p>ps: I tried to post this message in a couple of pizzagate subs but what I wrote it dissapear( twice).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So if you&#39;re being threatened by a sociopathic DC power player, who gives you a 10 second countdown, maybe you can forgive him for not being able to rig up a recording of the call on the spot?</p>

<p>Why the fuck didn&#39;t James sue Ryan then if he made this whole thing up? Sounds like he doesn&#39;t wanna be <em>anywhere</em> near a court proceeding or police station regarding this information...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The next time, Alefantis gives him a warning before the supposed call</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Like I said, watch the video; He gave him this little &quot;countdown&quot; of 10 seconds. He said &quot;you have 10 seconds to call me&quot;.</p>

<p>Then he showed him a bunch of pictures of his mom and son and family from facebook...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If the FBI really looked into it, why haven&#39;t they found anything? Why didn&#39;t he ever provide evidence of the report?</p>

<p>Are you new to this sub? You must be new to the concept of conspiracy culture, the idea that law enforcement is largely compromised and would protect people like James, who is one of the most powerful people in Washington DC by the way.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>why would he continue to sell pizzagate merchandise and vlogging about pizzagate?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ryan&#39;s voat username is &quot;IsThisGameOfThrones&quot;. He hasn&#39;t posted shit in months. Where are you getting your information?</p>

<p>Also, if you watched the video (again), you&#39;ll see it was James&#39; idea to craft the &quot;you&#39;re a profiteer just looking to sell t-shirts and make money off of this&quot; hoax in the text conversation. </p>

<p>I have spoken to Ryan before on Voat. He was one of the best investigators and users on that sub, I have no reason to doubt his story, and he has done nothing for me, not to give him the benefit of the doubt of being honest.</p>

<p>I love how this is a common defense of these pro pedo accounts... like yes my account in 13 days old, are you trying to imply that somehow I am less that you because your reddit Age is higher that mine? There’s never really an answer to this they just like to point it out for no reason to help the very fragile ego the hide behind the mask of the online-self. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>So if you&#39;re being threatened by a sociopathic DC power player, who gives you a 10 second countdown, maybe you can forgive him for not being able to rig up a recording of the call on the spot?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That was the second time. He mentions in his video he had already thought about recording the first time. Why didn&#39;t he record the <em>second</em> time?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why the fuck didn&#39;t James sue Ryan then if he made this whole thing up? Sounds like he doesn&#39;t wanna be anywhere near a court proceeding or police station regarding this information...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No need to bold so much of your text or use foul language. I&#39;m trying to look at the evidence objectively. Aren&#39;t we all looking for the truth?</p>

<p>There are no damages Alefants could sue for. Ryan&#39;s defense could easily be that he was trolled. The case is virtually impossible to prove. No lawyer would suggest wasting money suing someone for this. Try to look up similar cases. You&#39;ll see how difficult it is and how high the standard of proof is. It would be a waste of money and would only amplify the voice of his accusers (Streisand effect).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Like I said, watch the video; He gave him this little &quot;countdown&quot; of 10 seconds. He said &quot;you have 10 seconds to call me&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That was the second time. He had already been threatened before. He had already thought about recording before. Why didn&#39;t he record?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Then he showed him a bunch of pictures of his mom and son and family from facebook...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Consider this: The conversation only includes personal pictures of Ryan, yet none of Alefantis. If Ryan is making this up, he wouldn&#39;t have access to any personal pictures of Alefantis, but he <em>would</em> have access to pictures of himself/his family. Thus, this is not evidence of his claims, but rather reinforces the idea that he is lying.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Are you new to this sub? You must be new to the concept of conspiracy culture, the idea that law enforcement is largely compromised and would protect people like James, who is one of the most powerful people in Washington DC by the way according to GQ magazine.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li><p>There is no evidence that GQ would have any kind of special knowledge or access to the inner workings of DC</p></li>
<li><p>That list includes party planners</p></li>
<li><p>Alefantis was dating David Brock at the time, a DC political operative. Dating powerful people usually puts you on lists. Melania Trump would also be considered powerful, despite her own personal accomplishments amounting to not much more than modeling. Her power comes from who she dates.</p></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Ryan&#39;s voat username is &quot;IsThisGameOfThrones&quot;. He hasn&#39;t posted shit in months. Where are you getting your information?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I provided links. I&#39;m getting the information from his words.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also, if you watched the video (again), you&#39;ll see it was James&#39; idea to craft the &quot;just tell them you&#39;re a profiteer just looking to sell t-shirts and make money off of this, that should discredit you. Also tell them youtube removed the video.&quot; hoax in the text conversation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, consider the possibility that Ryan is making this up. This leaves him the opportunity to pursue making money of this scandal while maintaining his aura of integrity.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I have spoken to Ryan before on Voat. He was one of the best investigators and users on that sub, I have no reason to doubt his story, and he has done nothing for me, not to give him the benefit of the doubt of being honest here.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Forgive me, but I don&#39;t think he&#39;s a very good investigator. He didn&#39;t even think of recording his calls. Twice.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ryan says he &quot;tried&quot; to record the conversations, so this this reasoning doesn&#39;t really hold water. Also, most PG proponents I&#39;ve seen care very little about whether the law is broken when conducting their investigations (e.g. Edgar Welch). I don&#39;t think anyone in the PG movement would fault him for recording if they really believe Alefantis is raping and murdering children. Regardless, Ryan was in Texas when this incident happened. Texas and DC need only one party to consent to a recording.</p>

<p>I think you misunderstood my reasoning. I said Ryan&#39;s defense could be that he <em>was</em> trolled. That is, his defense could be that he legitimately thought Alefantis was threatening his life. That&#39;s literally all he would have to say. Similar to how a cop only has to say they were afraid for their lives, a defendant only has to say they legitimately believed what they said.</p>

<p>Alefantis would have to prove that Ryan lied on purpose. Proving what someone <em>believes</em> is very difficult without admission. Try to find a similar defamation suit in which the plaintiff won. You&#39;ll see how high the standard of evidence is in cases like this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We have a robust 1st Amendment right to say pretty much whatever we&#39;d like. Nobody here has shown that Ryan has anything to lose (I&#39;d be happy to look at a similar defamation case in which the plaintiff won).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s the Facebook chat they had, supposedly, read this and tell me it&#39;s not role playing. </p>

<p>Alefantis: Just the Pegasus video. Figure out how to do it — no waves.</p>

<p>O’Neal: I am a super reasonable guy. You don’t have to scare me like that.</p>

<p>Alefantis: You can keep your kill room shit about the rest of it. Fix this and we are reasonable.</p>

<p>[Alefantis then sent a picture of O’Neail and his mom].</p>

<p>Alefantis: Thanks. Feel ok?</p>

<p>O’Neal: Not really. Just threatened to kill everybody.</p>

<p>Alefantis: No need for all of that.</p>

<p>O’Neal: Deleted the video.</p>

<p>Alefantis: Good. Blame YouTube.</p>

<p>O’Neal: Delete the thread on Voat too?</p>

<p>Alefantis: They are taking things down. I think be more creative. Say you think it’s nothing or something — it’s your culture. CAlm down and think about it first.</p>

<p>O’Neal: Ok.</p>

<p>Alefantis: Let’s look and discuss. This might be ok. Thank you. Let me know when you have calmed a bit.</p>

<p>O’Neal: Give me a week.</p>

<p>Alefantis: Ha. Welcome to my world. Call me quick I’ll be nice this time. I appreciate you taking down.</p>

<p>O’Neal: I’m riding around with somebody. Gimme a minute.</p>

<p>[Alefantis then sent a picture of O’Neal and his girlfried].</p>

<p>Alefantis: Cute</p>

<p>O’Neal: Is that you being nice?</p>

<p>Alefantis: Not yet. So call quick then I can go to bed with less worries.</p>

<p>O’Neal: Mods deleted posts on Voat. 5 minutes.</p>

<p>Alefantis: Ok. What’s mods?</p>

<p>O’Neal: Moderators.</p>

<p>Alefantis: Humm draws attention?</p>

<p>O’Neal: They deleted because my content was removed I guess. Reason: 1 2 3.</p>

<p>Alefantis: Humm. Looks there.</p>

<p>O’Neal: Says deleted. “It looks like you are trying to make money off this.” Link doesn’t work.</p>

<p>Alefantis: That’s on Voat. ?.</p>

<p>O’Neal: About to call.</p>

<p>[At this point O’Neal called Alefantis back and said that “he was nicer” but still assured him he “would die” if he did not pull the video down].</p>

<p>Alefantis: Ok. One more thing this “happened to me.” YOU — created this. You can uncreate.</p>

<p>O’Neal: It’s an interesting subject. Just doing research on a hobby basically. I would never want myself or family to have any harm done because of this.</p>

<p>Alefantis: Meaning — you created it for yourself — you can uncreate. Yeh well it’s good you didn’t end up like Welch — in jail for 35 years. Or everyone who ‘s getting sued. You can find a much more profitable and beneficial hobby.</p>

<p>O’Neal: I mean nothing I did was wrong but wrong or not it’s just not worth it.</p>

<p>Alefantis: Actually lots of what you did is illegal. And punishable. But it’s expensive to sue. So people don’t do it. I can explain it to you someday. There would also be criminal — state charges on some of it. But you would need someone smart enough and connected who wanted to make sure it was enforced. And so far you don’t have that.</p>

<p>O’Neal: Took down the video. You win by a landslide.</p>

<p>Alefantis: So go to sleep. Thank you for that. It’s appreciated. And by the way this story is a pack of lies.</p>

<p>O’Neal: What is it then? Pure garbage?</p>

<p>Alefantis: Yup. I mean that wall is the same wall.</p>

<p>O’Neal: Oh I confirmed that lol.</p>

<p>Alefantis: But what the hell does that mean. And our families deserve to be safe.</p>

<p>O’Neal: No doubt. What y’all building in the room? Why the trenches?</p>

<p>Alefantis: You are too much man. On the edge of total destruction — still curious?</p>

<p>O’Neal: I’m curious for myself. No worries.</p>

<p>Alefantis: FBI liked your videos. So there is something. And. PLUMBING. Have you ever run plumbing?</p>

<p>O’Neal: lol.</p>

<p>Alefantis: To build a room it’s not trenches. Any basic construction moron would see the differ next.</p>

<p>O’Neal: So the kill room stuff was just a joke?</p>

<p>Alefantis: Difference</p>

<p>O’Neal: IDK about that stuff.</p>

<p>Alefantis: Ugh.</p>

<p>O’Neal: Sorry sorry I’ll stop.</p>

<p>Alefantis: You don’t know what. It’s a freaky room.</p>

<p>O’Neal: Construction.</p>

<p>Alefantis: that’s why people put shit on Instagram.</p>

<p>[Alefantis then texted a photo of an old job in which O’Neal worked on]</p>

<p>Alefantis: You never moved pipes I guess. You are a decorator.</p>

<p>O’Neal: I designed a few bars. You like? You’re quite the designer.</p>

<p>Alefantis: One more thing. If one of these assholes gets near my mom or her house that’s it for you. That’s bethesda fellows is driving over tomororen. I’m sure nothing will happen but if it does.</p>

<p>O’Neal: They’ve been talking about Pegasus for awhile.</p>

<p>Alefantis: Everything they say about me is true. Except I don’t like kids. At all. You should soon take all your shit down. Busted for profiteering.</p>

<p>O’Neal: Will do.</p>

<p>Alefantis: Night.</p>

<p>O’Neal: Goodnight. Take it down now or later?</p>

<p>Alefantis: It’s your culture.</p>

<p>O’Neal: heard.</p>

<p>Alefantis: Maybe all. Prob best. Disappear. Profiteer gone. I’m going to protect my family now. Now or soon.</p>

<p>O’Neal: Will do.</p>

<p>Alefantis: And I don’t really want to hear about you again from anyone. Night Ryan.</p>

<p>O’Neal: I’m telling you I’m done. Way too real.</p>

<p>Alefantis: Cute gf.</p>

<p>O’Neal: Thanks man.</p>

<p>Alefantis: Lucky boy. Keep your Voat profile though. Xo.</p>

<p>[Alifantis then sent a few emoticons: Two ping pong paddles, kissy lips, painted nails, and some money].</p>

<p>You can download the report yourself here</p>

<p><a href="Http://www.websterpd.com">Http://www.websterpd.com</a></p>

<p>Search Case # 17-000111</p>

<p>Or if you Google &quot;Case # 17-000111 Galveston Police Dept&quot; it was top result for me. </p>

<p>If you read the report Ryan didn&#39;t mention James Alefantis&#39; name to the police, didn&#39;t show the officer the texts/Facebook messages. </p>

<p>It&#39;s almost like he phoned the cops out, made some vague claim he was being harassed then... Nothing. </p>

<p>Now it gets brought up occasionally and Ryan still tries to earn money from pizzagate gear.com and so on. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It all started when Oneil innocently asked Alefantis if he would do a Ask me anything session on Twitter or FB, I don&#39;t remember, I&#39;m not on any of those platforms. Alefantis began his bullying Oneil, by answering back something like &quot;Why the F__ would I do that?&quot;, to paraphrase. </p>

<p>He threatened Oneil frequently, and Oneil has a personality that is not exactly commanding, I won&#39;t say childlike, but it just verified that this is how Alefantis speaks to his child prey, he gets the upper hand by talking down to them to make them do what he wants. You can see the same tactic with Podesta, his bullying speech. They try to instill fear in their victims. Oneil should have realized that as long as you have a paper trail or any kind of record, they can be detected, and they&#39;ll move on.That&#39;s why he wanted this and that to be deleted by Oneil. Oneil should have said &#39;shove it&#39;.</p>

I&#39;m no expert on legal matters but those allegations if false, would probably warrant legal action.</p>
