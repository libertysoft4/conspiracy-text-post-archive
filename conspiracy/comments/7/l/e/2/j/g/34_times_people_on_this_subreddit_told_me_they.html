        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;ve been saying I&#39;m going to do this for a while, and since the list keeps on growing, here we are about three months after the event. I invite everyone to look at the context of all these comments, taste them, weigh them, evaluate them for yourself.</p>

<p>Makes me wonder why so many people who know for a hard, indisputable fact that Vegas was a real shooting would hang out on a conspiracy forum.</p>

<p>I might have repeated a couple users just by losing track, but I actually think this should be at least 30 different users making these claims, none of which by the way were verified.</p>

<p>I tried to only include people who claimed to have &quot;2 degrees of separation&quot; or less. So I did not include the handful of Vegas residents who &quot;know&quot; people died because they live in Vegas and therefore people &quot;definitely&quot; died. Or the guy who said his wife received a work email about two people who had died in the company, therefore people definitely died.</p>

<p>Anyway, please enjoy this list.</p>

<p>Maybe you might also like to visit my other <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7jbmcn/complete_this_sentence_or_meet_your_doom_the/">thread</a> in which I asked for visual proof of shots being fired, gunshot wounds, bullet damage, or medical activity from the Las Vegas event and the best answer I got was a photo I call &quot;girl with blood on leg.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sandy/ Boston / Orlando all seem straight out the same lame play-book. Overwhelming litany of evidence that screams bullshit. I don&#39;t think any deaths arose from any of those 3. Unless it was due to extreme boredom at the usual lame sequence of events and crisis actors, fake blood...if there they even bothered and ridiculous triage and queues of real ambulances that were sequestered but were never allowed near any injured person. Manchester - not too sure. Perhaps people died  but it was allowed/ organised by the bunch of criminals at Westminster.</p>

<p>Wow, I know you meant to write, &quot;...talked to <em>a guy who was getting some ice, that talked to</em> the clerk who&#39;s doctor treated someone...&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah it does. I said the video shows neither gunshot wounds, nor bullet damage, nor medical activity. Several times in the video it can be heard &quot;no entry wound, no exit wound.&quot; It&#39;s pretty obviously <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmKODZ-SRYA">staged</a>.</p>

<p>Not to mention, this video was available within 48 hours of the event. Is this really all we are supposed to see in the three months after the &quot;deadliest mass shooting&quot; in US history? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dont get me wrong, i agree with you. LV is all bullshit and we are being misled. But there is so much false information on this sub. A decent marksmen can hit a torso at 450 yards multiple times with little effort. Bullet drop is about 8 inches at that distance. His rifles were set up well. nice optics that let plenty of ambient light in, good solid bipod (probably a harris/atlas), I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if the ammunition found in the room was match grade. With that said. 5.56 isn&#39;t the preferred round for that distance. Using .308 win or 6.5 creedmore would have been my choice.</p>

<p>Ballistics are tricky my friend, especially 5.56. It tumbles once it hits a body. It can enter through you armpit and exit out your ass. </p>

<p>Here are some clips of blood loss on the battlefield.  this Marine takes one the upper shoulder/neck and still walks himself to the bird.</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/aawQd9y-v5Q">https://youtu.be/aawQd9y-v5Q</a></p>

<p>ANA pretty much loses his face and multiple limbs/collapsed lung. Notice how little blood loss despite the amount of trama.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Little effort?&quot; Give me a break. We&#39;re talking about a distance of about 900 yards, and a guy with no shooting experience or tripods. The slightest deviation from recoil of the barrel would translate into the bullets hitting in large groups with very little precision. By the way it&#39;s worth pointing out that there are not even photos or videos of the bullets striking, or these groups of bullet holes there should be. The reason for this is that someone with ballistic and forensic experience (someone like you maybe) could triangulate and realize that the shots were not fired from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay. </p>

<p>Does Mike Cronk seem like a truthful guy to you?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look, if the veracity of just one piece of evidence is dodgy or flawed, it calls into question the entire event. 3 shots to the chest, at that distance would have to have been consecutive out of the muzzle   ( at least!!!) NO-ONE IS THAT LUCKY,  OR THAT GOOD - IN THE HISTORY OF BALLISTICS!! </p>

<p>That being said, this guy&#39;s demeanour is a lie. I&#39;ve been shot at with automatic weapons, even though I was young and stupid and thought I was immortal when I was in the SAPS, I had  the jitters for hours afterwards. No-way I could  string a coherent interview together afterwards if I was asked to. Well, not before i&#39; d changed my underwear and had numbed myself with alcohol. I just don&#39;t buy it. Being shot at and still having to deal with treating gunshot trauma and people dying in your arms...and all around you messes with your chi in a large way, regardless of whether you&#39;ve experienced it before or not. That alone makes the whole event spurious. </p>

<p>Oh, there was also the unlikely bravado of a whole bunch of people, standing around in many groups who continued to stand, without hitting the ground or running for cover. Like nothing that was happening would be perceived as a severe existential threat - despite the &quot;apparent&quot; hordes of people having brains blown out and dropping like flies from gunshot wounds all over the venue. Just NEVER happens...even if you are in body armour. Self preservation is instinctual. 😂😂😂</p>

<p>Just exactly what should we be looking for? Blood flying from exit wounds? Massive pools of blood? Like we see in the movies?  </p>

<p>Not really trying to be sarcastic. If the official story is true (/s) wouldn’t there be just sufficient slow down in the momentum of bullets to cause entry, but not exit wounds? Not blood flying around like in a Tarantino movie? </p>

<p>What I’m getting at here is this, and I’m not sure it’s clear. When someone is shot from that far away, should we expect that much blood to be visible?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Since I haven&#39;t seen anyone shot in real life I would need to defer to experts if we had any footage of anyone being shot. I doubt that it looks like a huge blood packet like in the movies, but then again maybe it does splatter a bit. What I do know is that there would be blood on the scene, lots of blood, probably footprints of blood too. </p>

<p>But there&#39;s not even this evidence of gunshot wounds. And there&#39;s no footage that anyone can seriously claim to show a person being shot. We can only evaluate the evidence we&#39;re given, like the Liveleak &quot;aftermath&quot; video everyone talks about. There&#39;s just not even that much to evaluate. I haven&#39;t seen any that is strongly indicative of real bullet wounds or damage. I would think that with all the videos where we hear the <em>pop pop pop</em> of gunfire, we would also have one that shows a steady visible series of bullet impacts in a similar rhythm. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Whether you think the OP is denying if people were shot or not don&#39;t you think it is more than a little strange that 6.2% of the people interacting with the OP claim to be associated with those murdered or wounded. That is an unusually high amount. </p>

<p>If you take the same level of contact and apply the same percentage to the US population (<em>323 million</em>) that means the OP ran into roughly 20,058,300 people who have some direct personal connection to someone who was a victim. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t those numbers seem a little off to you?</p>

<p>I bet if you put 100 people in a room you could easily find 6 people who know someone who knows someone who was shot at the festival. there were thousands of people there.</p>

<p>Calling it a hoax seems to be easy to disprove in this case, so it makes it much more suspicious to keep pushing the hoax idea. It&#39;s also much easier to discredit any of us who might take it for a hoax and try to explain it that way elsewhere.</p>

<p>A false flag is much worse than a hoax, and with the rate that the shooting is being covered up and buried is also more believable. No organization would put that much effort into a hoax and get so little out of it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not really.</p>

<p>There were a lot of people at the concert. There were 50+ people killed and several more injured in varying degrees. </p>

<p>One of the victims is from the town I just moved away from, and I know people who knew her. </p>

<p>This is why we have the phrase &quot;it&#39;s a small world&quot;. I have two degrees of separation from Jeff Foxworthy. Two degrees of separation from Avenged Sevenfold. Not interesting in the slightest, but my point is that if you know five people who also know five people each (excluding you), that&#39;s already 25 people you have a connection to. Realistically, people typically know more than only five people.</p>

<p>It&#39;s crazy how exponentially large your network could be with just meeting one or two people. </p>

<p>This is very problematic for me. Because I know for a fact they used crisis actors for this event  and that &quot;gore&quot; on liveleak was staged/fake. I will try to ask my Aunt some more details this Christmas Eve about what she knows.

    <div class="md"><p>I am purely just showing evidence of bullets being fired since that is what the guy who posted is saying that there is no proof of any shots fired. I don’t know what caliber or type of gun produced these movements but it’s proof that something was shot.  It seems like nothing will ever be good enough for some people to admit that shots were fired and people killed. Even the videos of dead bodies and people reject it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe because idiots like you think hundreds of actors all worked together with civilians who weren&#39;t in on it. Then in the matter of a few minutes put fake blood on themselves. Then after a couple more minutes they all laid on the floor and pretended to be injured. THEN more actors came in and pretended to drive these other actors to hospitals where fake doctors rented out the hospitals and pretended to help to these people in the ER. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This might blow your mind a bit, but I live in Northern Ontario and am connected to the shooting in three ways.</p>

<p>My uncle was playing blackjack at a nearby casino... he had to take cover as people were running in the casino stating there was a shooter.  He said nobody knew where the shooter was, but some people told him they believed there was multiple shooters.  He has no real opinion about the number of shooters, he said he had no clue.  </p>

<p>I also know a couple from a nearby town.  They were at the concert.  I don&#39;t have much details, but my mother who is good friends with one of their parents said they are pretty traumatized.  They saw people shot.</p>

<p>Another person I know through a previous job I had... he moved to the area and was actually doing some contract work at the Mandalay.  He was so close to the shooter he actually had an encounter with a security guard.  He had headphones on while he was working and had no clue what was going on.   Despite being close to the shooter, his exact location in addition to the headphones meant he had no idea till his encounter with the security guard.</p>

<p>Anyway... my point is that I don&#39;t think it is that odd that people on this sub know someone who was a victim.  I don&#39;t even live anywhere near Vegas, let alone the US, and I knew three people impacted by the shooting in different ways and none of those people know each other.  I&#39;m not a regular on this sub, rarely ever post here, but thought I&#39;d share.  The world is sometimes smaller than we think.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course he&#39;s lying. They always read from the same script, this event had a very obvious point they were supposed to make: &quot;it was a false flag but not a hoax.&quot; </p>

<p>So not only is this absurdly disproportionate number of people affected personally by the event, but they also all think there&#39;s a conspiracy involved, yet they harass and insult someone who questions the basic claims that people were shot, as if every other detail is possibly a lie but there&#39;s <em>no way</em> anyone would ever fake a shooting as part of a FEMA drill and broadcast it as real. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you saying that no one is <em>allowed</em> to believe that it happened but that it is not as candid as we assume?<br/>
Presumably some of these persons have some minuscule connection like the one <a href="/u/rkdrbuild">/u/rkdrbuild</a> mentioned.<br/>
We saw the footage, so we know that there was a loud noise and there were people scurrying about. Presumably not all of those persons were fake, and presumably they also had friends and family.<br/>
It doesn&#39;t matter if it was fake or not, something still happened, and it&#39;s not irrational to think that a few persons know some persons who know someone who was there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I definitely find it strange/suspect the &quot;broken leg&quot; person no longer needed medical attention in the taxi driver video, however,  I live and work in Las Vegas, and know 2 different people that were affected.</p>

<li><p>Co-worker has second job selling t-shirts at concerts.  He and his daughter were there.  No harm,  got out alive.</p></li>
<li><p>Another co-worker had to attend cousins funeral.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>So while I do think its possible there were crisis actors used/drill running concurrent, I have no question that people were wounded/died. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Incite more chaos.  I&#39;m really not sure.  The only convincing evidence I&#39;ve seen that C-actors were used is the taXi driver video, where the lady with the broken leg, suddenly no longer needs medical attention,  and then once safely away from the gunfire, the passengers proceed to offer the driver 100 bux to take them BACK to the strip.  Very strange.  But I will reiterate,  that people died, and people were shot.  If you can&#39;t accept this,  then you seriously have mental health issues.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well,  I&#39;m not talking about reactions,  like casual man.  Youre right,  everyone reacts differently, but I&#39;m talking about someone flagging down a taxi down a taXi stating emphatically that you have a broken leg and need medical assistance,  only to change their mind and want to go back to the gun fire.  That&#39;s suspect.   I also did not mention Sandy hook.  I really haven&#39;t researched it much, but it may or may not have been a hoax,  I could not say myself.

<p>Just exactly what should we be looking for? Blood flying from exit wounds? Massive pools of blood? Like we see in the movies?  </p>

<p>Not really trying to be sarcastic. If the official story is true (/s) wouldn’t there be just sufficient slow down in the momentum of bullets to cause entry, but not exit wounds? Not blood flying around like in a Tarantino movie? </p>

<p>What I’m getting at here is this, and I’m not sure it’s clear. When someone is shot from that far away, should we expect that much blood to be visible?</p>

<p>But there&#39;s not even this evidence of gunshot wounds. And there&#39;s no footage that anyone can seriously claim to show a person being shot. We can only evaluate the evidence we&#39;re given, like the Liveleak &quot;aftermath&quot; video everyone talks about. There&#39;s just not even that much to evaluate. I haven&#39;t seen any that is strongly indicative of real bullet wounds or damage. I would think that with all the videos where we hear the <em>pop pop pop</em> of gunfire, we would also have one that shows a steady visible series of bullet impacts in a similar rhythm. </p>
