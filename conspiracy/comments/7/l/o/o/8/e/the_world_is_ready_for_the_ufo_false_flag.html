<p>&quot;The Face of Allah Weapon Returns&quot;, Wired, <strong>May 2008</strong>: <a href="http://archive.is/ftWXN">http://archive.is/ftWXN</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;[...] projecting the image of something frightening – like a deity – is not a new idea and follows in the footsteps of the <strong>Voice of God weapon</strong>, a device that some have suggested could be used to transmit messages into people&#39;s head, as if God were speaking to them.</p>

<p>&quot;Nor is the <strong>God hologram</strong> really a new idea, though it&#39;s interesting to see it&#39;s still bandied about; military analyst Bill Akin wrote about this concept back in 1999, which described it as holographic image of Allah.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&quot;When Seeing and Hearing Isn&#39;t Believing&quot;, Washington Post, <strong>Feb. 1999</strong>: <a href="http://archive.is/ALqxP">http://archive.is/ALqxP</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;For Hollywood, it is special effects. For covert operators in the U.S. military and intelligence agencies, it is a weapon of the future.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Pentagon planners started to discuss digital morphing after Iraq&#39;s invasion of Kuwait in 1990. Covert operators kicked around the idea of creating a <strong>computer-faked videotape</strong> of Saddam Hussein crying or showing other such manly weaknesses, or in some sexually compromising situation. The nascent plan was for the tapes to be flooded into Iraq and the Arab world.</p>

<p>&quot;The tape war never proceeded, killed, participants say, by bureaucratic fights over jurisdiction, skepticism over the technology, and concerns raised by Arab coalition partners.</p>

<p>&quot;But the &#39;strategic&#39; PSYOPS scheming didn&#39;t die. <strong>What if the U.S. projected a holographic image of Allah floating over Baghdad urging the Iraqi people and Army to rise up against Saddam</strong>, a senior Air Force officer asked in 1990?</p>

<p>&quot;According to a military physicist given the task of looking into the hologram idea, <strong>the feasibility had been established of projecting large, three-dimensional objects that appeared to float in the air.</strong></p>

<p>&quot;But doing so over the skies of Iraq? To project such a hologram over Baghdad on the order of several hundred feet, they calculated, <strong>would take a mirror</strong> more than a mile square in space, as well as huge projectors and power sources.</p>

<p>&quot;And besides, investigators came back, what does Allah look like?</p>

<p>&quot;The Gulf War hologram story might be dismissed were it not the case that washingtonpost.com has learned that a super secret program was established in 1994 to pursue the very technology for PSYOPS application. <strong>The &#39;Holographic Projector&#39; is described in a classified Air Force document as a system to &#39;project information power from space ... for special operations deception missions.&#39;</strong>&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It would take a massive mirror in space to do this? </p>

<p>&quot;Russians to Test Space Mirror As Giant Night Light for Earth&quot;, The New York Times, <strong>Jan. 1993</strong>: <a href="http://archive.is/aI99S">http://archive.is/aI99S</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;In much the way a schoolchild playing with a hand mirror learns to reflect a spot of light from a bright window into the crannies of his room, <strong>some scientists believe they can put large, orbiting mirrors above Earth that could illuminate darkened areas below with spots of reflected sunlight that measure tens of miles across.</strong>&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&quot;Reflecting sunlight into space has terrifying consequences, say scientists&quot;, The Guardian, <strong>Nov. 2014</strong>: <a href="http://archive.is/AtyHT">http://archive.is/AtyHT</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Fighting global warming by <strong>reflecting sunlight back into space</strong> risks &#39;terrifying&#39; consequences including droughts and conflicts, according to three major new analyses of the promise and perils of geoengineering.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&quot;Is It O.K. to Tinker With the Environment to Fight Climate Change?&quot;, The New York Times, <strong>April 2017</strong>: <a href="http://archive.is/I89Lr">http://archive.is/I89Lr</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;A planet cooled by an umbrella of <strong>aerosol particles</strong> — an umbrella that works by <strong>reflecting back into space</strong>, say, 1 percent of <strong>the sun’s incoming energy</strong> — might give societies less incentive to adopt greener technologies and radically cut carbon emissions.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As evidenced by the following relevant excerpts from the description of a patented invention, the technology <em>already exists</em> to create a &quot;lens&quot; in the upper atmosphere using plumes of particles.</p>

<p>&quot;Method and apparatus for altering a region in the earth&#39;s atmosphere, ionosphere, and/or magnetosphere&quot;, Google Patents, published <strong>Aug. 1987</strong>: <a href="http://archive.is/HiB01">http://archive.is/HiB01</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Weather modification is possible by, for example, altering upper atmosphere wind patterns or altering solar absorption patterns by constructing one or more <strong>plumes of atmospheric particles</strong> which will <strong>act as a lens</strong> or focusing device.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;[...] <strong>a properly positioned plume will provide a reflecting surface</strong> for VHF [very high frequency] waves and can be used to enhance, interfere with, or otherwise modify communication transmissions.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I encourage everyone to read more about that invention, by the way, because it details how the weather can be modified and how all of the communication systems on Earth can be blacked-out or disrupted.</p>

<p>So, <strong>in summary</strong>, whether using actual mirrors, aluminum-coated plastic film, or particles in the upper atmosphere, it is possible that not only could sunlight be focused on the Earth or reflected back into space, but <strong>three-dimensional, holographic images could be displayed on Earth using these reflective devices.</strong> The fact of the matter is that the means to carry out such an operation are being explored, and considering the time that has passed since these ideas were first discussed in newspapers, it seems likely that such technology is already completed or being refined and tested to be used to deceive the masses.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Many of them will, but a minority of them will see the deception for what it is. Some Muslims and Christians are very much anticipating the arrival of the False Messiah—a person who will portray himself as a deity, wowing the world with magic and illusion. <strong>Muslims and Christians believe that most people on Earth will fall for the deception, including a great deal of people who claim to believe in God.</strong> The majority of Muslims and Christians, despite being warned of the False Messiah, will still end up worshipping him!</p>

<p>This is why there is an agenda to water down all of the world&#39;s religions to make them all seem more similar than they are different. Co-existing and treating each other with justice and equality and living in peace and harmony together sounds great and all...but this idea of uniting the people of Earth under a common cause has a much more sinister underlying reason. The False Messiah will act like he is going to creat Paradise on Earth, but he is a deceiver, and everyone who follows him will meet a terrible end.</p>

<p><strong>Let&#39;s not forget that most millennials have rejected the three Abrahamic, monotheistic religions in favor of &quot;New Age&quot; beliefs. People are identifying as Satanists, Wiccans, neo-pagans, &quot;Plebeian Starseeds&quot;, and Atheists and Agnostics with leanings towards occultism.</strong> They will totally embrace the staged alien invasion. Think of all the sci-fi buffs who will completely buy into the staged invasion and obediently follow our &quot;alien overlord&quot;.</p>

<p>There are people who don&#39;t believe in God who believe in astrology and tarot card readings. There are unbelieving people who hold the belief that we can alter &quot;the universe&quot; in our favorl they think we can bend the laws of the universe to our own will to produce our own desired results, and in their minds, this is just science rather than magic. There are people who don&#39;t believe in God, but who think that humanity can continue to &quot;evolve&quot; and become like gods on the Earth—super humans who transcended to a higher level of consciousness through &quot;spiritual alchemy&quot;.</p>

<p>The point is, many different types of people will go along with the impending NWO. Many religious and irreligious people will lap it up. The minority who do not, however, will be those believing people who remember that the Messiah will come <em>after</em> the False Messiah and utterly destroy him.</p>

<p>Check out this link describing what is so obviously the Antichrist/False Messiah as a figure called &quot;<strong>Maitreya</strong>&quot;: <a href="http://www.share-international.org/maitreya/ma_main.htm">http://www.share-international.org/maitreya/ma_main.htm</a></p>

<p>That article, by the way, incorrectly says that Muslims believe the Mahdi is the Messiah or like the Messiah. That is false. Muslims believe a man known as the Mahdi will be leading a group of believing Muslims during the time that the False Messiah/ad-Dajjal is misleading nearly everyone on Earth. Muslims, like Christians, believe Jesus, upon whom there is peace is the Messiah.</p>

<p>The idea that &quot;Maitreya&quot; is the religious figure awaited by all world religions is an idea promoted by the <strong>Theosophical Society</strong>. Spend any amount of time reading about their views and the agenda becomes abundantly clear.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I don&#39;t get why people are now saying that any disclosure about ETs and UFOs is fake. I thought most conspiracy theorists were at least very open to the possibility that there has been a cover up around such things, now all of a sudden just because this stuff is going mainstream it&#39;s all a lie? I guess I can see why, if there is a sudden alien invasion scary scenario, we shouldn&#39;t buy into it immediately, because ;et&#39;s face it, if these beings have been around for decades then they&#39;d have already invaded by now. But so far, there&#39;s not been any invasion or anything, just disclosure about there being tech from outside Earth. Honestly I can&#39;t even believe this has been disclosed, on the news, and everyone is acting like it&#39;s nothing. Everyone meaning the masses. The government has basically admitted ETs have visited our planet and it&#39;s this crazy amazing news that has been received in such a weird anticlimactic way. I don&#39;t get it at all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A staged alien invasion will be used to establish a united world government led by the Antichrist/False Messiah/ad-Dajjal.</p>

<p>Check out this compilation of <strong>Ronald Reagan</strong> saying on three different occasions that an outside threat by aliens would unite the world: <a href="https://youtu.be/iQxzWpy7PKg">https://youtu.be/iQxzWpy7PKg</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;...we often forget how much unites all the members of humanity. Perhaps <strong>we need some outside universal threat to make us recognize this common bond</strong>. I occasionally think how quickly <strong>our differences worldwide would vanish</strong> if we were <strong>facing an alien threat</strong> from outside this world.&quot; </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Um, wut?</p>

<p>Now watch this clip of <strong>Bill Clinton</strong> regurgitating that same narrative: <a href="https://youtu.be/QvcDNrKOlOM?t=2m20s">https://youtu.be/QvcDNrKOlOM?t=2m20s</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;...if we were visited someday, I wouldn&#39;t be surprised. I just hope that, uh, it&#39;s not like &#39;Independence Day&#39;, the movie—that it&#39;s a, you know, a conflict. It might be <strong>the only way to unite this increasing divided world of ours</strong>. They&#39;re out there, we&#39;ve had our—think of how all <strong>the differences among people on Earth would seem small</strong> if we felt <strong>threatened by a space invader</strong>. That&#39;s the whole theory of &#39;Independence Day&#39;.&quot; </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So...he hopes that if it happens it&#39;s not like &quot;Independence Day&quot;...but at the same time, if it was, it would be good because it would unite the world? Interesting...</p>

<p>Now watch this trailer for the SyFy series <strong>&quot;Childhood&#39;s End&quot;</strong>: <a href="https://youtu.be/tC2j-AZsJIA">https://youtu.be/tC2j-AZsJIA</a></p>

<p>Karellen, an extraterrestrial being, says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;My name is Karellen; I am the <strong>Supervisor for Earth</strong>. Under our supervision, you will all flourish here—peace, health, security for everyone.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now watch this clip showing the great reveal of Karellen, the so-called &quot;Supervisor for Earth&quot;: <a href="https://youtu.be/eEVV7s73B_8">https://youtu.be/eEVV7s73B_8</a></p>

<p>Karellen, holding the hands of two children, looks incredibly similar to Eliphas Levi&#39;s Baphomet and the <strong>Satanic Temple&#39;s Baphomet</strong> statue in Detroit: <a href="http://imgur.com/a/r7wun">http://imgur.com/a/r7wun</a></p>

<p>The &quot;Childhood&#39;s End&quot; series is based on the 1953 science fiction novel by the British author <strong>Arthur C. Clarke</strong> who once said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Any sufficiently <strong>advanced technology</strong> is <strong>indistinguishable from magic</strong>.&quot; </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ad-Dajjal/the False Messiah/the Antichrist will be a <strong>sorcerer who uses magic to deceive</strong> the masses.</p>

<p>Also, Clarke wrote the 1968 sci-fi novel &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;. In the novel, as summarized by Wikipedia ( <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001:_A_Space_Odyssey_(novel)">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001:_A_Space_Odyssey_(novel)</a> ):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;[...] an ancient and unseen alien race uses a device with the appearance of a large crystalline monolith to investigate worlds all across the galaxy and, if possible, to encourage the development of intelligent life.&quot; </p>
</blockquote>

<p>As if to suggest that aliens made humans &quot;evolve&quot; and a therefore responsible for all advances humans have made. This is also the idea pushed by <strong>&quot;Ancient Aliens&quot;</strong>.</p>

<p>Long story short, the novel&#39;s protagonist, Dr. David &quot;Dave&quot; Bowman, &quot;is transported via the monolith to an unknown star system...&quot; </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;He is brought to what appears a pleasant hotel suite, carefully designed to make him feel at ease, and falls asleep, whereupon he becomes an immortal &#39;Star Child&#39; that can live and travel in space. The Star Child then returns to Earth, where he detonates an orbiting nuclear warhead.&quot; </p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the 1968 <a href="https://youtu.be/AXS8P0HksQo?t=2m2s">film</a>, directed by Stanley Kubrick, this space baby is shown with his left eye illuminated for some time.</p>

<p>Now, watch this Pepsi production, &quot;Black Knight: Decoded&quot;: <a href="https://youtu.be/8uuEJBUuhjc">https://youtu.be/8uuEJBUuhjc</a></p>

<p><strong>The video suggests that regular people trying to expose the existence of aliens are being stifled by government agents</strong>, as demonstrated by one official-looking guy who says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;If this gets out, there will be mass panic; shut it down.&quot; </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This public reaction was already tested by <strong>Orson Welles</strong>&#39;s reading of a 1938 radio adaptation of H. G. Wells&#39; novel <strong>&quot;The War of the Worlds&quot;</strong> over the radio.</p>

<p>The message that is &quot;decoded&quot; from the satellite &quot;Black Knight&quot; says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;We came to you many thousands of years ago when your civilization was young. You have grown quickly and efficiently, but you still have so much to learn. <strong>If you want us to return</strong>, on the night of your next full moon, <strong>the people of Earth must show us that they are ready</strong>; we will be watching.&quot; </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The beginning of the video says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;In 1899, <strong>Nikola Tesla</strong> discovered a satellite orbiting Earth.&quot; </p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Donald Trump</strong>&#39;s paternal uncle, <strong>John G. Trump</strong>, a professor of engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) apparently reviewed Tesla&#39;s work after his death.</p>

<p>According to <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/donald-trumps-nuclear-uncle">this article in The New Yorker</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;[John G.] Trump was involved in radar research for the Allies in the Second World War, and in 1943 <strong>the F.B.I. had enough faith in his technical ability and his discretion to call him in when Nikola Tesla died in his room at the New Yorker Hotel</strong>, in Manhattan, raising the question of whether enemy agents might have had a chance to learn some of his secrets before the body was found. (One fear was that Tesla was working on a &#39;death ray.&#39;) As Margaret Cheney and Robert Uth recount in &#39;Tesla, Master of Lightning,&#39; <strong>Professor Trump examined Tesla’s papers and equipment</strong>, and, in a written report, told the F.B.I. not to worry: Tesla’s &#39;thoughts and efforts during at least the past 15 years were primarily of a speculative, philosophical, and somewhat promotional character,&#39; but &#39;did not include new, sound, workable principles or methods for realizing such results.&#39;&quot; </p>
</blockquote>

<p>On June 30th, <strong>Donald Trump</strong> signed an executive order to revive the National Space Council, which was last active in 1993.</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/TAUqcBc0hYI?t=8m5s">He said</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Our journey into space will not only make us stronger and more prosperous but will <strong>unite us</strong> behind grand ambitions and <strong>bring us all closer together</strong>. Wouldn’t that be nice? Can you believe that <strong>space is going to do that</strong>? I thought politics would do that. Well, we&#39;re gonna have to rely on space instead.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Strange.</p>

<p>Personally, before discovering Islam and converting about two years ago, I was an Agnostic for 10 years, and during the last couple of years of that, I got really into <strong>&quot;Ancient Aliens&quot;</strong>, and I truly started to think that it made sense that an intelligent race of extraterrestrials that has been around longer than us influenced human civilization. I have come to realize, <strong>thank God</strong>, that this is part of a great deception to cause us disbelieve in our Creator, to believe that there is a superior race of alien beings watching us, and to accept the introduction of a single world government led by a deceptive HUMAN individual who does not have our interests at heart!</p>

<p>We are living in a time when believing in God is seen as foolish, while there are disbelieving people who are literally convinced that they are <strong>&quot;Plebeian Starseeds&quot;</strong>/&quot;Nordic Aliens&quot;. </p>

<p>People refuse to worship our Creator and disbelieve in the angels, the Prophets and Messengers, the Messiah, the Antichrist, the jinn, Satan, the Day of Resurrection and the Afterlife...but they willingly believe other mystical ideas. People disbelieve in miracles, but will easily fall for magic and illusion.</p>

<p>This <strong>&quot;New Age&quot; religion</strong> has already taken hold of Millennials. What else is necessary to pave the way for the <strong>False Messiah</strong>, with his <strong>united world government</strong> and his <strong>unified world religion</strong>? How many more generations need to be born in order for this <strong>Great Deception</strong> to reach its final stage? In the eyes of occultist elitists, humanity is nearly ready to accept this! That is why we see all of these increasingly, overtly ritualistic award shows and sporting event performances; they&#39;re celebrating the upcoming arrival of this world leader. We&#39;re on the edge, yet only a minority of people can see it for what it really is.</p>

<p><strong>To conclude</strong>, all of this information seems to suggest that a staged alien invasion will indeed be used to unite humanity under a single world government, and the leader of that world government will be the one Christians and Muslims know to be the Antichrist. Anyone with any sense at all will not fall for this deception when it happens.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The abbreviation for &quot;subhanahu wa ta&#39;ala&quot;—meaning &quot;the most glorified and the most high&quot;—would be &quot;s.w.t.&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;P.b.u.h.&quot; stands for the English phrase &quot;peace be upon him&quot; and is used when speaking about the Prophet Muhammad, sallallahu alayhi wa sallam (s.a.w.s.). I prefer to use s.a.w.s., which means &quot;upon whom are peace and blessings from Allah&quot;. At the very least, I prefer to say, &quot;upon whom there is peace&quot; instead of &quot;peace be upon him&quot;. I just think that, grammatically, it makes more sense.</p>

<p>Allah, s.w.t., knows my intention in glorifying Him with this phrase is not to impress born Muslims and make others think I&#39;m &quot;hardcore&quot;.</p>

<p>Your assumption about what my beliefs used to be and what they will be in the future are completely off-base and, if you have any faith in your Creator at all, you will refrain from making assumptions of this nature in the future. If you want to know something about someone, you can ask them.</p>

<p>My family are Protestant Christians but they are totally non-practicing and the only time we ever went to church was on Easter to please my great-grandmother when she was in good enough health to still go. I identified as Atheist at 13 or 14, and then as Agnostic from around 15 to 23. During that time I did indeed look into all other major world religions, including Buddhism briefly, but I never believed in any other them or embraced any of them; I just wanted to know what they were all about. </p>

<p>I reverted to Islam at 23, and I am now 26. I am married to a Muslim man and left the U.S. to live in a Muslim-majority country. In shaa Allah, by God&#39;s will, I will never fall back into what He once took me out of; I will never leave Islam now that I have accepted it as my faith. I will certainly never proclaim myself as a prophet or lead a cult! What a mighty accusation...</p>

<p>&quot;How can someone believe in god when we KNOW aliens exist? You&#39;re just in denial and one of <em>those</em> people&quot;. Science will be a higher authority on beliefs/religion because they&#39;ve set it up for them to be gatekeepers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t believe this shit either. But it wouldn&#39;t take a lot. </p>

<p>Start with an event, have a good population witness a small portion of it, small enough for them not to know what it is but can b explained by the media later. </p>

<p>Grab some explosives and blow up a building, have it stormed by little green men and have them leave. Then panic the public by what they &#39;took&#39;. </p>

<p>All it takes is authority to talk about it and the media to parrot it and those idiots out there will believe it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>UFOs means Unidentifed flying object. Aliens means a race or species that is not born on this planet. </p>

<p>Ufos can easily be advanced military craft. Aliens can not. Please use the correct terms to avoid confusion. </p>

<p>Sayin ufos are real is a very unclear statement. Are you saying that aliens are real or that there are military planes are real??</p>
