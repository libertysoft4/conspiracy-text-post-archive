<p>If I am correct and TMOR are SB and MM then someone paid them to change the narrative of the original post by cross referencing and putting that post in their sub. Then miraculously, they all agree with each other with no dissenting voices among them, then they post with positive comments and upvoting each other in galore, all in unison. Fishy. </p>

<p>Because you could say, as many have said before, they are just bullies, but what is the point of harassing if it indeed cross referenced posts are conspiracy in nature? It&#39;s just a waste of time. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t know about them till I joined this subreddit either. TopMindsOfReddit subreddit. They are mostly banned users from here back when you were banned for being liberal. Hence they are mostly of the same mindset in being liberal. It&#39;s a joke subreddit where they post dumb shit people write.</p>

<p>Us being a conservative leaning sub and since those users were banned from here they often target this sub for ridicule. They openly admit they target dumb shit and it is not representative of the sub the user is from.</p>

<p>Conspiracy seems to have take this quite literally and I&#39;ll be downvoted for writing this. However, people gotta stop taking shit literally every time. Who cares what they post and are people really so fragile to get offended by them?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re mistaken about the origins of that sub, although maybe you&#39;re right about people banned here going there. </p>

<p>In actuality, TMOR formed when the sub r/conspritard changed their rules to not allow any posts that link back to Reddit. Seeing as that was the entire point (laughing at outlandish theories, and the rampant racism/antiwhateverisms that were/are commonplace here) a majority of the users left and formed TMOR. Oh and in case you were wondering, the sub&#39;s name comes from a post by a user here. Some pasta worthy diatribe about how the users of this sub were the top minds of Reddit.</p>

<p>So you can assume they are all shills if you like, but I&#39;ll tell you that the users there will just get a kick out of it. I mean personally I love being called a shill for having dissenting opinions, it&#39;s hilarious.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The thing about them that doesn&#39;t sit right with me, is how they pass up the low hanging fruit.  If you sort this sub by new, especially at night in the US, you can find enough foilheaded batshit for a weeks worth of front page material on TMOR.  Instead they routinely attack our more prominent users for their political views, which are only marginally unconventional.  It really does feel like a smear job.</p>
