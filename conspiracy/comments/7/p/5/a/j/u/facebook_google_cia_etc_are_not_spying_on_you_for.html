<p>Everytime you click &#39;you are not a robot&#39; the AI becomes smarter. It can recognise a bridge, a car, a sign. Words you type into google, phrases you post on Facebook and your likes/dislikes are all put together, billions upon billions of pieces of information, to create a &#39;bell curve&#39; of the average person.

    <div class="md"><p>That is most certainly not what captchas are for as someone in the field. Most advanced machine learning techniques and algorithms can already detect 98-99% (better than the human eye just look at Facebooks deep mind) images of certain objects. Object recognition of one of the easiest ML tasks and there are numerous techniques. We should not be scared of that as literally the only thing that those classifiers can do is label things judging by the pixels. </p>

<p>The reason why they show you certain pictures is because they make these photos &quot;trick questions&quot; for the classifier that bots (two rounds in case the classifier gets lucky). The way these classifiers work is based on probability. You will notice that those pictures are always have a lot going on and the car or street sign will be hard to notice as a human. These classifiers work by finding that object it thinks has the largest probability so it&#39;s top two choices could theoretically be between a car and a donkey at 49% and 48% and the other 3% at miscellaneous things. </p>

<p>Most people have this false definition and fear of AI because they fear what they do not understand but the reality is that the only AI we should really be fearing are the ones from places like Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and Amazon that are essentially learning personalities.</p>

<p>Well first of all my point was that most people lump all &quot;ai&quot; into the category of human like intelligence which as I explained is completely inaccurate as most &quot;ai&quot; is just classifiers who spit out answers with a number of the probability as there reasoning hardly anywhere near anything to be fearful of.</p>

<p>Second of all I don&#39;t think you see the bigger picture. Its not about marketing the information at all. Think about all the data collectively that Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and Amazon have about you. Your location, your entire browsing and search history (yes even the incognito stuff), everything you have bought online, your friends, your photos, your messages, basically your entire life is now online. What can one do with that information?</p>

<p>Well they can train an neural network like structure specially designed for all that information to essentially predict your future decisions. Now that seems like something only advertisers would use right? Now imagine being able to do that for over 1 billion people and you can easily see how this can become a tool of mass manipulation and power.</p>

<p>Source? Do you not count Uber? Sure there spending billions of dollars on self-driving cars but with the lawsuits and lack of any executives who knows what will happen there. The Cab industry was a shitty market to begin with.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course I understand what globalization is.</p>

<p>Open borders for trade and capital investment (or capital exodus as it turns out in the US) sounded great on paper. In practice, it has rapidly destroyed a great deal of the manufacturing sector in the US. And in return, we received an abundance of cheap goods, a ridiculous amount of debt, and suppressed wages. I will concede that many other factors are in the mix, but globalization was/is a shit deal for most Americans. </p>

<p>Uber is not the only company in the game. Ford has an exclusive deal with Lyft. FedEx and UPS are looking to automate, and I personally believe they will go with Tesla technology, though this is just my opinion. When I posit that there hasn’t been a truck driver or cab driver born in the US in several years, this is just simple math. With trucking and logistics automated, or even just a great deal of market share thus, the capital saved will be exponential. Next comes private transportation. </p>

<p>The “experts” (venture capitalists and fund managers, that is, the financial experts) seem uncertain about many aspects of the business implications, so I will hazard my own hypothesis. Once a sizable minority of transportation is automated, it will happen very quickly. There will a moment in time when it is painfully obvious that nearly every single accident is caused by human error. I will also ascribe any accident caused by mechanical failure as human error in this respect, as at some point very early in this process, when FULLY autonomous vehicles are beyond beta, every autonomous vehicle will be programmed to have maintenance performed when it is necessary, as opposed to when the driver decides it is necessary. It is at that stage that only the extremely wealthy and the statutorily exempted vehicles will be able to afford insurance premiums. I believe that certain classes of commercial vehicles will be exempted for a period of time until overwhelmed by capital. Say pick ups and small commercial vehicles that require optimum mobility to perform work.</p>

<p>Anyway, I don&#39;t fear marketing. I am wary of economic pressures engendered by the technology. And I do not believe that the government has a good reason to spy on every single electronic communication. </p>

<p>Marketing is easy to avoid. Coercion much less so.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Amazing post. I have been thinking for a few weeks now why automation hasn&#39;t reached office workers (i&#39;ve just made a new thread about it!) but i totally forgot about the logistics and transport services. They will be automated and, as you say, once the savings are seen by other industries, shit will really hit the fan.</p>

<p>Although i can&#39;t prove it and i don&#39;t want to disagree with you, i think the first universally automated sector is the banking sector. People are only employed in that sector for the sake of having a job. Kind of like how some celebrities are famous just for being famous, bankers have jobs just to have jobs, not because they are needed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also, they learn from our images. If you told Google&#39;s learning AI early on to make a flower, it was very modest and not realistic. But now after incorporating machine learning it trains itself instead, using our images, yep your images! So now, if you tell it to create a flower, it is solo good, it looks like not only a flower, but a photorealistic flower! Expand on this and it&#39;s kind of scary. The huge increase in ability was due to OUR data (pictures) and it&#39;s own method of teaching itsrlf. The way it gets better is from constant attempts that are rated by users on the internet. I&#39;ll try and find the documentary or Ted talk I saw this on, and the link where you can help it learn by rating it&#39;s generated images of things.</p>

<p>Autodraw isn&#39;t an AI learning how to draw. They used an artist&#39;s images. Autodraw is just a way of organizing clipart. If you don&#39;t know the name of something, but do know its shape, you can use this to find what you&#39;re looking for. Not a bad idea, but if all I&#39;m looking for is a horse, it would be easier to just type in &quot;horse&quot; than try to draw one.</p>

<p>Edit: I was only half paying attention to what you wrote. It wasn&#39;t autodraw, but something else that you said was an AI learning to draw. Oh, well. :P</p>

<p>Where is the thing where I can tell Google what to draw for me? I want to tell it to make a donkey riding a horse to see if it works.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The autodraw is not the clip organizer, your edit about it not what I was referring too is correct however.

I thought it was Google, but couldn&#39;t find anything...Might have been Amazon now that I think about it.  And I don&#39;t think it took complex situations I&#39;ll check around and see what I can find.</p>

<p>It was also cool to hear how AI or what we call AI was thought to have been reaearched initially back decades ago, and kinda of died after no real applications and/or computing limitations, then was dormant for a really long time, breathed interest by not many people and then the teaching itself to learn better neural algo somethingaruther made strides, and these paintings/drawings started to be able to start looking more and more photolike...it wasn&#39;t weird that it was made by a machine because its heart is just a set of math that has complexity, but it was <em>creating</em> not copying or replicating, different flowers and bees, ok now im rambling and probably wrong...back to digging.

    <div class="md"><p>DARPA just invented TCP/IP as a way to have robust, redundant communication networks on the battlefield.  It was then shared with big IT companies - IBM, DEC, AT&amp;T, Xerox, who integrated it into their systems but it wasn&#39;t until AT&amp;T made a public, open source implementation of TCP/IP for Unix that it began to take off as the networking protocol standard.  </p>

<p>Bear in mind, DARPA did not invent &quot;The Internet&quot; as we know it.  Websites using HTTP were created later by CERN.  (The first website is still online here: <a href="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html">http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html</a> ) TCP/IP is just the backbone protocol that all other internet protocols rely on (FTP, SMB, SMTP, etc...) </p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe anyone involved in the early internet had any idea what it would become.  They were initially just looking for a better way to route phone calls automatically.  So I very seriously doubt the government planned on using the internet as a spy tool from the onset.  That being said, once they realized how much information was passing through the ISP&#39;s networks they jumped on the chance to harvest all that data.  </p>

<p>The ARPAnet ceased operations in 1990. And Licklider died in 1990 a year before the World Wide Web as we know it was even in operation and open to the public. Any spying protocols for individuals, which we know now from Snowden are numerous, were developed post WWW launch. The NSA didn&#39;t even get into that in a big way until after 9/11/2001 <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4065414/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1">per William Binney</a>    </p>

<p>I would say that the A bomb, and the H bomb have not been beneficial in any way whatsoever</p>

<p>If you believe that the benefit of this technology was abnegate the necessity of an invasion of mainland Japan, this is belied by the peace offers of Japan, which insisted only upon the condition that the emporer remain as the titular head of government</p>

<p>The so-called unconditional surrender demanded by the Allies granted this condition regardless</p>

<p>Another scary thought is that of facial recognition and how various corporations almost definitely are collecting facial data, perhaps even iris data, that can be sold on to security companies and police forces.

    <div class="md"><p>i agree. as the technetronic era unfolds (brezinsky)  other ai uses are </p>

<p>complete profiling of each individual, judging present and predicting future behaviour and rendering preventative measures (preemptive incarceration, reprogramming and liquidation among others). this will make grassroot movements, sponaneous revolts etc impossible.  when they happen it is because they were meant to happen (to enable a thesis/antithesis/synthesis cycle).</p>

<p>detecting crime retroactively: big data analysis by a powerful ai is able to detect all minor and major crimes, violations etc by any individual exposed to electronic surveillance committed in the past.  the legal system, also controlled by ai will issue fines and punishments automatically and without human interaction for the benefit of the for profit prison complex and other major corporate interests.</p>

<p>complete tracking of the natural resources and their use on a smallest scale possible, detecting and preventing any unauthorized use for the benefit of big agro, big pharma, big oil and so on.</p>

<p>tracking of all financial movements including the black and grey markets and taxing everything accordingly (hunt for taxes)</p>

<p>police and later robots and drones will have instant access to all informational resources needed for on-the-spot decisions - very little if anything will be overlooked.</p>

<p>personally, i was unfortunate to experience banking ai four years ago, it operated independently and its decisions were irreversible, even though it was at fault</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not so sure about this. I think people overestimate AI.</p>

<p>There was a very popular video a while back, a CDP grey, about how robots were going to take all the jobs. Every single example given in the video was an exaggeration. </p>

<p>He claimed AI was already writing music, and played a piece from Emily Howel (an AI). Sounded great. Failed to mention the dynamics, instrumentation and harmonization was added after the fact by a musician.</p>

<p>Claimed AI was already writing newspaper articles, and mentioned Quill. If you go to their site you can read something written by Quill, supposedly. It basically takes very rigid data sets and translates it into slightly less boring paragraphs. So if X went from 80 to 150 in Y time, it would say &quot;X has seen a large increase over the last Y. And if X went from 80 to 240, it would say &quot;X has more than tripled in Y...&quot; It&#39;s not shakespeare.</p>

<p>When AI is talked about, it&#39;s being sold. So of course it&#39;s going to sound like the end all. But I haven&#39;t seen it do much more than busywork. In my mind, the real conspiracy is government run schools which basically teach nothing but busywork.</p>
