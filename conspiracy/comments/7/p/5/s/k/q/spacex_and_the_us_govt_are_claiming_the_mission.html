    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. I immediately thought when I heard this, they&#39;re lying.  It doesn&#39;t make sense. Remember a few weeks ago when they fired that rocket off without any advanced notice, which scared a shit ton of people?  Then for this launch, with a super secret classified satellite payload, they give all this advanced notice, with live streams, the whole nine yards.  </p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t add up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What rocket did they fire off without notice? You mean the spaceX Iridium 4 mission which people knew about and many people were watching on a live stream? </p>

<p>The Zuma mission was on short notice and top secret but got scrubbed after a &quot;fairing issue&quot;... who knows if it was a fairing issue or what the actual reason was.. and then launched sunday.  </p>

<p>Anyways, you can&#39;t hide launches because the FAA requires notification. </p>

<p>And once you know the type of orbit they are not terribly hard to find unless this is one of those supposed stealth satellites they might be developing. </p>

<p>In any case who knows what actually happened or where these rumors came from. </p>

<p>The whole Zuma launch thing has been a bit odd from the beginning... but the Iridium 4 mission was just a routine mission...</p>

<p>That&#39;s not true at all. Just because people didn&#39;t know they had a launch coming doesn&#39;t mean it was a secret. <a href="https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2017/11/iridium-next-4-december-launch-vandenberg/">Here is an article</a> from before the Iridium NEXT 4 launch talking about the launch window.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can only speculate of course, but it is doubtful in my mind that such a weapon would be deployed so quickly from the beginning of this trouble with NK.  I doubt they would rely on spacex to deploy such a weapon systems if it was needed urgently, too, but it might be possible that our space capabilities have literally degraded to this point thanks to Musk&#39;s attack on the public space program.</p>

<p>Personally, I don&#39;t see why an EMP would be the weapon of choice against NK, either.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Personally, I don&#39;t see why an EMP would be the weapon of choice against NK, either.&quot;</p>

<p>Right?? They have nothing to EMP. In fact, any EMP against NK would hurt us more than them because the vast majority of what passes for consumer tech in that country is shitty DVD and MP3 players and it is mostly there in the first place because it was smuggled in to bring the regular people news of the outside world in the hopes of bringing some kind of balance to their fanaticism that has been literally nurtured since birth.</p>

<p>Military and government tech in NK will be hardened as much as possible.</p>

<p>But what OP said can be read another way... &quot;an EMP device for NK&quot;. Meaning an EMP device on behalf of NK, to be used against us. With all the talk in the media of an EMP attack being really North Korea&#39;s only viable weapon against us, it could be we put a device up there to false flag ourselves and call it a NK EMP attack. </p>

<p>But I highly doubt anybody would use SpaceX to do that. There&#39;s no point. Both the US and NK governments have rockets already.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ha! Now you&#39;re talking.  And a novel weapons systems like that, that we never saw on TV being deployed against an enemy... people will attribute that to the work of an &#39;other&#39; very easily.</p>

<p>I agree spacex would not do that, just because they are so shit.  I also think an EMP weapon could be so devastating it might not be viable as a false flag weapon.  Perhaps a chemical weapon or a nuke smuggle to the west coast?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;I also think an EMP weapon could be so devastating it might not be viable as a false flag weapon.&quot;</p>

<p>Very true. Supposedly it only takes 1-2 EMPs to disable the entire US. With a false flag there has to be victims, sure, but there also has to be lots of proxy victims in order to get upset on behalf of the victims. And the proxy victims have to be able to &#39;go to war&#39; whatever that means, but it probably at least means having a viable infrastructure.</p>

<p>So no, we won&#39;t be seeing an EMP false flag any time soon.</p>

I do not think it is possible to hide the satelite.  It would have to absorb arbitrary types of energy that our telescopes could shoot up when we look through the sky for things.  For example, it would literally have to be invisible to hide it from a huge number of people with access to powerful telescopes who have no reason to lie and say it isnt there.</p>

<p>Certainly none of this is impossible, but we are getting to &#39;fantastic&#39; levels, in my mind.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes.  Its tough for me to speculate just how much you can conceal satellite function based off the type of energy it is absorbing at different points and the type of transmissions it is sending and receiving.  You could also begin to correlate information about the satellite purpose based off its positioning through time, seeing if how the enemy changes the satellites operations in reaction to things you do.  And of course whatever other intelligence assets you can get on the ground.     Likely their analysits are looking at shit we can&#39;t even think of, such as the rocket payload which put it in orbit, who they think built it and for how much, etc. </p>

<p>Finally, I think there have been instances where otherwise unknown spacecraft have passed by US satellites at close range, perhaps foreign space programs trying to figure out what we&#39;re up to?  </p>

<p>Not as vast as you may think.  On the best and clearest night sky you can only see stars less than 300 light years away.  Or about 2000 total.  With telescopes you can see much much more.  And you can also see when something passes in between you and a star.</p>

<p>I say this as it seems Russia, China, Iran, or North Korea would be the most likely to want to track the technology. Bear in mind that I really don&#39;t know what I&#39;m talking about here, this is just conjecture.</p>

<p>Similarly, how large is this satellite? If it&#39;s the size of a minivan, does this make it difficult to see with a telescope, in the same manner that we often don&#39;t see asteroids until they are right on us?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the really large states which would be interested, like China and Russia, have sufficient resources to put sensor energy on any point in the upper atmosphere in the world, if they really want.  Don&#39;t forget they have things like arborn ELINT, AWR, plenty of naval assets that would have no trouble tracking a rocket, etc.  I think there are certain extremely powerful large land based over the horizon radar arrays which could be used, too.  I think they use some kind of crazy effect where they propagate energy through the upper atmosphere to go like, way over the horizon?  Im not so famliar with these systems Im just assuming they must work this way for them to be worth it compared to other options.  Of course, these actors have satellites of their own too.  In this sense they dont even have to worry about tracking a visual signature.  Though Im sure they take a good look when they can.</p>

<p>I have no idea how large it is.  I think its classified so probably no one can tell you.   My understanding is that even civilian astronomers (not just like everyday people but like scientists and shit) have powerful enough telescopes that we can take pretty good looks at even really small objects in earth orbit, even correcting for certain amounts of that blurring effect that makes shit... blurry.  Forget what its called.  Maybe not though. </p>

<p>Im not sure if its true we only see satellites until they are right on us.  Usually we see asteroids which will pass by earth way before they reach any sort of distance which is as close as an artificial satellite, right?</p>

<p>You are correct, I was just referencing the times that we don&#39;t see them, <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/near-earth-asteroid-pass-no-armageddon-speed-how-close-nasa-space-collision-course-a8131361.html">like this one</a>. </p>

<p>That&#39;s not to say it&#39;s impossible, just that even if we&#39;re looking we can still miss things. As such, I wonder how difficult or easy it would be to spot one. I do know that you can see the ISS without using a telescope, but that&#39;s when light is reflecting off of it. I would be curious to know how hard/easy it is to make an object hard to see (black would blend with the night sky but would stick out during the day, unless you were high enough up to &quot;hide&quot; behind the blue reflection of the sky...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First - none of us, including you, know that we already know about <em>&quot;most&quot;</em> of the big conspiracies. We might only know about the tip of the iceberg.</p>

<p>As for incompetence - even though some of these <em>now</em> confirmed conspiracies were suspected far before they became &quot;confirmed&quot;, many are only ever confirmed after said conspirators admit to it, or release documents many years after the fact.</p>

<p>Conspiracy theorists are ridiculed for years before any of these kind of conspiracies are actually confirmed. It&#39;s not usually incompetence that confirms these conspiracies; it&#39;s the government/intel agencies just not giving a shit if people know about it after so many years.</p>

<p>They only &quot;confirm&quot; it when they know no one will give a shit and/or do nothing about it. They know the majority of people will say &quot;Oh just because they lied to our faces 100 times before doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;ll do it again!&quot; If they even bother remembering the previous 99 times at all.</p>

<p>They also know a lot of those people will act like <em>they</em> knew about it all along (as in the Edward Snowden revelations) and keep acting like conspiracy theorists are insane and never right about anything.</p>

<p>The idea that everything is some ridic conspiracy.</p>

<p>Where everything is run by a big shadowy one world government. </p>

<p>Everything happens for a super secret insidious reason.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>See.. that&#39;s an awful lot of &quot;everything&quot;s.</p>

<p>Pretty much no one here believes that <em>everything</em> is one big conspiracy, that <em>everything</em> happens for an insidious reason or that <em>everything</em> is run by a one world government.</p>

<p>And I think you know that. But we don&#39;t sound nearly as crazy if you paint things in a more accurate light and say that instead, most of us think <em>some</em> things are a conspiracy, that <em>some</em> things do have an insidious agenda behind them, or that <em>some</em> things could be and probably are controlled by an international group of elites.</p>

<p>If you view this sub as one person&#39;s beliefs then of course it&#39;s going to look like we all think <em>everything</em> is a conspiracy. But we all obviously have our own beliefs, opinions and thoughts, so stop talking about this sub and conspiracy theorists in general as if we&#39;re all one person because it&#39;s bullshit.</p>

<p>Also:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Cause none of us want to live in a world where no one has control</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That has nothing to do with it. All we have to do is look back to the hundreds or thousands of points in history to see that various different people and groups of people try and <em>do</em> control other people and events. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not even <em>kind of</em> a reach to believe it is happening currently and will happen again in the future. It&#39;s human nature, especially for those with power, to manipulate things and people around them for their own agendas.</p>

<p>There&#39;s also not really a reason to do that. SpaceX gets their publicity from the actual launch and the landing. After that they like to show the deployment for the manufacturers benefit but in this case the manufacturer obviously doesn&#39;t want anything shown.</p>

If this is the case, here is what we can expect.  Depending on the state of the satellite, it may be kept in orbit with some kind of limited functionality available.  If the satellite&#39;s orbit is decaying or if we want to ensure no one will be able to recover it, we may try and have the satelite crash itself back to earth.  Failing all of this, it is likely we will use one of our anti satellite weapon systems -- either the f-15 ASAT missile, or a specially modified SAM,  fired from a guided missile cruiser.  This could all take months to sort out and every possibility is a difficult engineering challenge.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I ready an article this morning and they mentioned that this wouldn&#39;t be the first time that the government claimed a satellite failed and was destroyed, when in reality they were just saying that to fool both the media and the Soviet Union. I&#39;ll look for it, but I think there&#39;s a good chance they&#39;re just lying to divert attention. I doubt any major government would just fall for that though, they could easily just monitor the payload.</p>

<p>One would assume they&#39;d only attempt this kind of diversion if the satellite in question has some kind of stealth technology.</p>
