No victims, no victim’s families, no survivors interviewed, no video, no more anything. It’s like it’s all just gone. How can you have people in the rooms around him, but never interviewed, in a hotel in city that has cameras every five feet?<br/>
I realize we have all discussed it being a cover up of some sort, but what shut all the chatter down?  I’m just curious. I don’t think the truth will come out, the investigation was basically f@@ked up from the get-go. Intentionally or not, that whole thing was screwed up from the minute he fired the first shot. And 500+ injured?  Where did that number come from?  Ugh, I’m just curious. </p>

So. basically they are cleaning up Paddocks track&#39;s and traces to keep anyone important from being exposed, OR, they are doing their job.  Let&#39;s hope the later.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I heard from another r/conspiracy thread someone speculated he was a gun runner for a Saudi Arabian prince who was a Wahhabi Muslim, which is a radical extremist form while his brother was a moderate Shuni and they were both vying for heir to the throne and it was an assassination attempt by the first brother who owned the top floors of the Mandalay Bay, as it seemed the more moderate brother was likely to inherit the thrown and it was a terrorist attack that was meant to distract from the assassination and also you know since they were extremists, also spread their cause. Also that Paddock killed before the shooting even happened and that’s why there was a missing hard drive in the computer too. That’s all speculation though I don’t have any of the links that the OP provided that’s just the gist of what I remember what was theorized. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If that was the case why did they just arrest him a few months later? </p>

<p>I think the Saudi prince that owns the hotel over Mandalay Bay (like 6 floors up from paddock) was a major player in this though </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah that was the main point of my comment haha. Also iirc he said the moderate prince was supposed to be assassinated at the Tropicana. I remember hearing on the news too people saying they initially said there was another shooter at the Tropicana but it was deemed “false”. This is all speculation though I have no idea what happened, that’s just what I read in that other thread</p>

<p>Whatever happened, they fucked up bad. If it&#39;s simply the LVMPD and FBI giving out wrong info and now going silent because they&#39;re afraid of lawsuits. I don&#39;t believe it&#39;s that cut and dry but certainly possible. </p>

That Jesus Campos guy being paraded as the official hero <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7gj1FoRIfE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7gj1FoRIfE</a> only to be fading into obscurity instantly.</p>

<p>The Dems drumming up their usual &quot;gun control&quot; chant but all of a sudden being dead silent, letting go that slam dunk of a case.</p>

The ritual took place 1 month and 11 days after the eclipse 
10/1 or 11 on the Jewish Calendar is    11th of Tishrei, 5778 or 9
10/1 was 1 day from Yom Kippur and 11 days after Rosh Hashana II occurring in the 9th goyim month</p>

<p>The festival used a hexagon logo and purple color theme on the poster both Saturnian symbols</p>

<p>The note was left on a hexagonal table by Steven(crown in latin) Paddock (livestock enclosure) </p>

<p>He rained down terror from the 32 floor(highest degree in Scottish free masonry) to sacrifice the innocent sheeple in front of a giant black pyramid, obelisk and Sphinx. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly! Once I noticed the tell tell clues of ritual magic; I was able to fully focus on that aspect and ignore the insane media circus that sucks energy and time. </p>

<p>This one was packed full of bullshit, with prepackaged rabbit holes that allowed several different scenarios to seem plausible. The “investigation” theater was highly scripted to make this thing stink to high heaven. People were furious, terrified, frustrated, grief stricken and hopelessly lost, as the magic unfolded and no answers were in sight. </p>

<p>The ritual was highly successful no matter what anyone thinks did or did not happen. 10/1 was about creating absolute chaos, fear and public anxiety. It pulled in regular folks ,who normally would dismiss any claims of government conspiracy. and made them permanent targets for future fuckery. </p>

<p>I hope what I have learned and shared can help others avoid the energy traps that soak up the worst in us and magnify negativity within our collective consciousness. I was bad off for years and would actually look forward to the next terror event so I could “expose” the elite and feel a sense of duty in the dark world I had surrounded myself in. I wanted to be a beacon of light and hero to the sleeping masses. I was going to show them the enemy and together we would rise and smash him! The truth showed me the enemy was within me and my battle against evil was allowing evil to fester within my own heart. Researching dark occult topics is way more dangerous than I ever imagined. I had accidentally let the enemy take over my heart and mind! </p>

<p>Keep your spirits high and your eyes on the prize. —Much love</p>

<p>how so?  AFAIK nobody was &#39;scared&#39; by this (bullshit) event.</p>

<p>IF it &#39;had worked&#39; they wouldn&#39;t have stopped talking about it</p>

<p>there are more &quot;sides&quot; than just the &#39;dark side&#39; and you don&#39;t know how <em>successful</em> they <em>have been</em>,, starting with DT&#39;s election and a year later look at HOW MUCH has changed!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m with you on it seeming like a ritual, but not with numerology. Especially when your numbers come from a Gregorian calendar, in the US format. You use the dates in the EU and it all changes. I believe the cult that performs these public rituals, if that&#39;s what they are, would not center their numerology around numbers that can be shifted so easily to become meaningless. Focusing the numbers you chose to is like looking at the magician but not his hands. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No offense taken! I’ve never been to the EU, but last time I checked they were using the Gregorian Calendar as it originated from Rome, no? </p>

<p>Numerology is a very important aspect in these rituals and this event has significance not only in our calendar but also in the celestial calendar (solar eclipse) and the ancient Hebrew calendar. 10/1 is stacked with all kinds of occult symbology and numeric significance. This is just the surface level. </p>

<p>This will all make more sense later in the year when Pluto the destroyer travels into the house of Capricorn and further weakens the Saturnian control matrix. The veil is being lifted a little more each day!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They do use Gregorian, but their format is DD/MM/YY, whilst ours in the US is MM/DD/YY. That rearranged placement would mess with the order of numbers right? And so far I see no evidence to suggest numbers alone have mystical power, just that most cults think they do, and can tie many coincidences together with it, and make it seem more than it is.

    <div class="md"><p>It was a show, a hoax, a drill, a spectacle.  Nothing bad happened to anybody.  No one was shot, no one was injured, no one died, not even Stephen Paddock.  They were all actors, agents, staff.</p>

<p>The FBI paid a company similar to this one <a href="http://www.crisis-solutions.com">http://www.crisis-solutions.com</a> to stage the hoax.  They co-ordinated with DoD, Mandalay Bay, the concert security company, and Jason Aldean.  The CIA controls the media for them.</p>

<p>This is called a Capstone Exercise just like Sandy Hook.  They don&#39;t want to hurt you, but they want you to be scared, paranoid, and distrustful of your fellow humans.  Then you&#39;ll be easily controlled.</p>

<p>TLDR: this is state terror</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This explanation simply doesn&#39;t make sense to me. What does this honestly accomplish and why would you go through all the trouble of creating a false attack, replete with actors, fake videos and fake emergency response when you could with far more certainty, push some nutjob(s) into taking the action on their &quot;own&quot; volition? I mean, the goal is fear and distrust right? Don&#39;t you think it would be a lot more terrifying if the body count is real? Why are crisis actors a neccessary component at all even if it&#39;s false flag operation? Think about 9/11. Did they need to fake the destruction or simply obfuscate the operation?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol, sure it is. Have you stopped to consider the consequences of people actually getting shot? The legal consequences? The families haranguing authorities and demanding justice years, decades, later?</p>

<p>These mass media events are carefully crafted and controlled, from end to end, in minute detail - see Integrated Capstone Events for an explanation. Once you stop listening to what you are told and start examining the evidence directly, you’ll see that they are ALL (obviously) stage managed productions, with a script, a cast and a backstage operations centre. The media does its part, the actors and celebrities do their part. Nobody dies, nobody gets seriously hurt. Everyone in the know is happy with the outcome.</p>

I am just dumbfounded that people cannot put 2 and 2 together.  They released information about his gambling history and the whole thing makes perfect sense.  The large number of guns in the room makes perfect sense.  There are a couple of lose ends, and those are the type that you would expect an extended investigation to get into.   There is no &quot;lack of details.&quot;  Plenty of details have been provided.  People just chose to ignore them. </p>

<p>Except based on the most recent reporting in the NY Times, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/23/us/las-vegas-shooting-stephen-paddock.html?_r=0">Paddock still has a substantial estate worth nearly $5 milllion.</a></p>

<p>Why do you commit a mass shooting and suicide when you&#39;ve got an estate valued that high?  Sure, if he&#39;s down to $200k or something then it makes sense, but $5 million for someone Paddocks age is a fortune.  If <em>I</em> had that money, I&#39;d be boating in Florida for the next 20 years and still have some left over.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s look at what that article actually said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Eric Paddock said his older brother was a multimillionaire, but he doubts that the estate will end up being worth $5 million. He suspects his brother may have sold his stocks, emptied his bank accounts and disposed of the money somewhere before the attack.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Eric Paddock said that what would be left of his brother’s assets — which includes two homes in Nevada — would perhaps total $500,000 to $1 million.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, Eric Paddock could be full of shit and some of it is just his speculation.  But the $5 million number is &quot;according to some estimates,&quot; and includes his real estate holdings.  What we do know is that Stephen Paddock was a gambling addict.  And he was not winning since some mysterious event in September 2015.    </p>

<p>While it is possible that he was sitting on $5 million in cash, it is also possible that his cash and liquid assets were largely depleted.  In any case, one thing is certain.  If he did have $5 million, and he was losing $2 million a year from gambling, then he would have $0 in 2.5 years.  In any case, rich people commit suicide, and I don&#39;t consider a total net worth of $5 million at 67 to be &quot;rich&quot; -- basically an above average worth for someone that didn&#39;t have kids.  One thing that eats your assets is kids.</p>

<p>Now, to answer your question &quot;Why do you commit a mass shooting and suicide when you&#39;ve got an estate valued that high?&quot;  For the exact same reason you acquired that estate in the first place.  Paddock had a plan.  His plan was to protect his the status quo, as it existed prior to September 2015.  The plan didn&#39;t work out and the mass shooting and suicide was the logical consequence of the plan, given that is was one of the contingencies.  Lombardo disclosed the FBI psychological profile and it explains why Paddock would commit a mass murder and suicide.  the FBI psychological profile would not be consisted with boating his way through retirement.  So while numerous other people could come up with useful ideas of what to do with $5 million, we need to look at what someone with Paddocks past history and psychological profile would do.  </p>

<p>There are variations on rich, but $5 million in investment capital is a lot to live on.  Just invested in tax-free municipal bonds it produces an annual income of $125,000, which is tax free, and roughly equal to a taxable earned income of close to $250,000, and that&#39;s without drawing down the principal.  You could probably boost that to $300k with principal drawdown and still be well off for a decade or more.</p>

<p>My takeaway from the article wasn&#39;t that he was or poor, but that nobody really knows anything and it&#39;s all a giant information black hole, which is the original point of this thread and what I agree with.  We&#39;ve been given a purported motive, etc, but we keep running into information vacuums or stonewalling by the FBI on information.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not sure what information you are looking for.  The information that would be useful is what event happened in 2015 relating to his gambling.  Exactly who did he speak to about that event.  Those records likely do not exist because they were destroyed by Paddock.  I don&#39;t need to see a video of him carrying bags up to his hotel room.  If he took the elevator, the stair, the service elevator, none of that is really important to what he did or why he did it.  It is relevant to Mandalay Bay&#39;s culpability.  Obviously, if he was toting 23 rifles openly through the casino and no one stopped him to ask him questions, then MB is going to owe a lot of money.  However, I do not think that is likely.  Instead, he took the weapons in suitcases specifically to avoid detection.  Sure, they could release the 10,000 hour of surveillance tapes, but I don&#39;t think they are going to show anything useful.  Instead, what is useful are the events from 2015, and I do not think that FBI has some magic wand that just lets them pull that data up.   </p>

<p>Unless you are a hardcore conspiracy theoriest (no one died, it was the CIA and Paddock&#39;s body was planted), most of the questions have been answered.  We know who, what, when, and where.  The &quot;why&quot; comes from 2015 and they don&#39;t have all the information sorted out yet. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sometimes things happen that the general populace can&#39;t know about/shouldn&#39;t know about either short-term or long-term in an effort to protect the masses or bring those responsible for an act like this to justice.</p>

<p>This is one of those cases.  </p>

<p>Nothing is as it appears.  The truth would be mundane and not believed by some who imagine fantastical government plots to murder country music fans and yet it would shock the naive into disbelief and unrest.</p>

<p>There is absolutely no reason to divulge any aspect of this act at this time.  The majority of the public wouldn&#39;t believe the truth and it would do nothing to repair what happened or serve justice.  Furthermore the truth could potentially put many more lives at risk. </p>

<p>“Your priests, your postman, your teacher, the world at large ... They won’t believe any of this,” Murray says. </p>

<p>“We water it down,” Nancy exclaims.</p>

<p>Ask yourself this - to what end do you want the unfiltered truth?  Would you still want the truth if it meant many more people would die as a result?  What if there was no one truly to blame?  What if you knew the whole truth but it did nothing to make the situation better and in fact only made things much much worse?</p>

<p>Believe me, I once thought that truth was power and everyone deserved to be told everything but I was wrong.  Sometimes the truth enslaves you.  Sometimes the truth makes a situation worse and has no benefit.  And I know that is hard to swallow and is of little consolation to most of you.    </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Deep thought and searching for answers is normal and healthy.  What is unhealthy and unproductive is clinging to one outlandish theory with very little evidence.</p>

<p>If anything all theories should be weighed equally until such time that overwhelming evidence is presented.</p>

<p>Being too hungry for an answer or someone to blame can be disastrous.  Case in point - 9/11.  By the end of the day on 9/11 we had the face of an enemy thrust before us and most people were screaming for blood.  Well blood we got, the blood of our service men and women spilled all over the sand in countries that most likely had nothing to do with the atrocities of 9/11.</p>

<p>So yeah, I prefer it this way actually.  I realize it&#39;s little solace to the victims and their families.  I know a lot of us are curious creatures and we want answers and justice.  But sometimes answers and justice aren&#39;t neat and tidy.  Sometimes not knowing - even permanently -  is actually safer and more conducive to allowing us to live the life a lot of us are comfortable with.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying to not look for answers, not at all.  What I&#39;m saying is to be careful to not get hung up on a false narrative just because you hunger for the truth and in turn wind up believing in falsehood.       </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hello my friend.  I reread my post and nowhere did I use the term &quot;mass hysteria&quot;.  I did use the term unrest.  </p>

<p>There are several distinct differences between this shooting and 9/11 but I would argue that 9/11 caused great unrest in this country.  The time that followed saw increased military action where thousands of soldiers died, sweeping surveillance and &quot;security&quot; measures and policies were implemented, tourism and travel were impacted, the country&#39;s economy suffered.</p>

<p>Imagine how much worse it would have been had we not had Bin Laden to blame, wasn&#39;t that convenient.</p>

They are just covering up any fake blood and other artifacts from the crisis actors. They also seem to be deep cleaning (scrubbing) up any fragments or debris from the water bottles with firecrackers in them.</p>

<p>Military sound projection technology + Firecrackers in water bottles to simulate the effect of bullet impacts.</p>

<p>Non-crisis actors were not fooled by this sound projection (like people with intimate knowledge of firearms.) You can hear them in this video. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIQfb6Kc_sg&amp;amp;#t=01m20s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIQfb6Kc_sg&amp;amp;#t=01m20s</a></p>

<p>So zero impacts can be found the next day? Not a single spark caught on video? How many rounds? 1000?</p>

<p>You now have witness enough to conclude that this was actually a hoax.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It’s weird that the majority of the victims are so well known by people on this sub. Jason Aldean must have hit some kind of a magic cross section of the country for that to have happened. Like what are the odds that out of 55+ people killed, over 40 of them knew people who read r/conspiracy??</p>

<p>If we aren’t allowed to talk about whether or not it was a hoax, then at least we should talk about that coincidence. Because you can’t deny it’s pretty remarkable. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s the article if you want to see some of these claims for yourself.  Just see if they feel authentic to you. Like you said, the question must also be asked why they&#39;re on a conspiracy forum and what the odds are that there would be so many, and this is only the ones who were replying specifically to <em>me.</em></p>

<p>Personally I don&#39;t know anyone in real life at least who I see on a daily basis anymore who uses Reddit let alone is a conspiracy theorist who uses Reddit. </p>

<p>Since they published this, like I said, probably ten more people have made similar claims pushing the number to 40.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Listen, I used to think stuff like you find in subs like this were just figments of imagination. But the Vegas shooting was what introduced me to the rabbit hole. And I paid close attention to the release of the JFK files, and once I read through some of those, I realized there&#39;s truth behind a lot of these allegations. There is not one single person I know who buys the media narrative of the Vegas shooting. Even just on the golf course, my friends and I were talking about how they&#39;ve changed the timeline 4 times, and drastic alterations at that. </p>

<p>So yeah that&#39;s why I&#39;m here I&#39;d like to know more about it. For instance I didn&#39;t realise the story has changed 4 times I was only aware of three: #1) the guard was shot after responding to shots fired into the festival, than the shooter killed himself #2) the guard was shot before shots were fired into the festival, no known reason why the shooter stopped to kill himself #3) <em>Now I&#39;m not sure of this one because of the media blackout</em> but didn&#39;t they change the story back scenario #1? and what is with the 4th timeline change? what is that one about I must have missed it? a link will do if you don&#39;t feel like typing it all out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I may be wrong on the exact minutiae here, but this is how I recalled it. At first it was Campos was shot 15 minutes after the mass shooting. Then it became Campos was shot 6 minutes before the shooting. Then it became 1 minute or less before the shooting. In addition to that, some news group (I think Time) did an analysis of various scanner, environmental, and other acoustics and came up with their own timeline which matched none of the LVMPD narratives. 200 rounds shot right at you, and all you get is a superficial flesh wound? Luckiest mother fucker in the history of the planet.</p>

<li><p>paddock supposedly sent “200” rounds through hotel for, of which only one? Hit Campos?</p></li>

<li><p>a single pic of the “800” round fires casings all within the room would have quelled a lot of suspicion. Instead we got a “leaked” pic of a dead body and no more than 100 countable rounds from those pics, and only 3 near the body of the patsy</p></li>
<li><p>literally everything we know is based on propaganda from the official narrative, and that’s because we haven’t seen a single piece of evidence at all</p></li>

<p>But the true fact is that we haven’t heard a single thing from the “survivors”</p>

<p>Why aren’t all the courageous and heroic heroes of suffering plastered all over every talk show like in the past?</p>

<p>Fuck saudis. All of them. They did this. (Or the mossad did this to make us think “fuck saudis”)</p>

<p>It’s 100% a false flag at this point.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually, I think the one thing that is correct, give or take several victims is the count. The hospitals all report that info pretty accurately and they corrected the number even when it changed by 10 or something like that when a couple people were double counted. I know there&#39;s several people on this website and elsewhere that believe no one got hurt or killed (not saying you, based on your post). There&#39;s not a doubt in my mind people were killed. Some of the 500 could simply be minor ankle injuries from running or falling... something like that. Not all gunshot or even really serious wounds. With only 3 hospitals, it&#39;s hard for me to believe that number could be fudged that much. Too many people in the medical field, working for the hospitals to fudge the number so drastically. If it was off, I&#39;m guessing it&#39;d only be by 100 or less. Just my take. </p>

<p>do you have any idea How many &#39;fail safe&#39; actions hospitals take to AVOID EXACTLY THIS from happening?</p>

<p>Those name tags you get on your wrist are HIGHLY specific AND the computer knows exactly &quot;how many and to whom&#39; they are given (during triage -- Before ANY treatment)</p>

<p>Na, they said there were 500+ <em>wounded</em>, not &quot;injured&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;accidents&quot; where &lt;10 people were &quot;counted twice&quot; is pure Bullshit OR incompetence worthy of litigation</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m honestly not trying to start an argument with you here, but in the presser Lombardo gave in the days following, he corrected the exact amount of people saying it had changed because a few patients had been counted twice. It was in the wake of a lot of confusion when they were simply trying to get the number correct for the <em>press</em>. Perhaps you work in the medical field and know more than I, but I&#39;d imagine they were doing a count for this specific purpose and not insurance billing. Hospitals were filled to capacity. This happens quite frequently with mass shootings where the reported number of deaths are initially wrong. But, I&#39;ve never seen the sheriff specifically fuck it up. I can try to sort through the videos to find it if you&#39;d like. </p>

<p>And, for the most part, I was actually trying to explain to the OP (in a sense agreeing with you) that the number was accurate. Perhaps I didn&#39;t do it in the best way. However, the point I was making was the same as yours. The 500 number is indeed correct (or <em>reported</em> as closely as possible). </p>

<p>I appreciate you giving specifics. </p>

<p>BUT you just spent 300 words explaining why it probably <em>wasn&#39;t</em> accurate?! I said nothing about insurance so why do you? &quot;this happens <em>quite frequently with mass shootings</em>&quot; WUT? &#39;frequent mass shootings? wtf?!&quot;
 &quot;500 is indeed correct&quot;? (it was like 557 or something I forget) so WUT&#39;s with you stating 500?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why the hostile attitude? Aren&#39;t we supposed to be working together on these and not arguing. I said I appreciated you for giving specifics and apologized (if you don&#39;t want to take it literally, I suppose that&#39;s your choice). I have no beef with you, man. </p>

<p>You actually did mention insurance: </p>

<p><em>becoz IF the hospitals didn&#39;t do this even more people would die from MIStreatment and the hospitals would go broke from insurance claims!</em></p>

<p>Also, the OP mentioned 500+ people. I apologize if I didn&#39;t give the exact number or add the + symbol. I was simply trying to demonstrate that number was in the right range. The OP seemed to question the large quantity of people. If I didn&#39;t research the extra 57 and you took offense to that, again, I apologize. Like you, I did not remember the exact amount of people. I knew it was in the range of 500. </p>

<p>The purpose of my post was to point out to the OP that the number <em>in the range of</em> 500 people was correct. The OP appeared to be questioning (as well as frustrated) whether or not 500 people were actually injured and where the number came from as well as many other inconsistencies. </p>

<p>Please look at the context in which I wrote &quot;this happens quite frequently with mass shootings&quot; (not frequent mass shootings). The rest of that sentence was... &quot;where the reported number of deaths are initially wrong.&quot; 
Please note... the word &#39;reported&#39; and the mention of press prior to that. In the Columbine shooting, for instance, the number of casualties was reported incorrectly <em>initially</em> as 25. In this instance, it slowly grew from 200 to 500 (and please note I do not have those exact figures). </p>

<p>When I said I was essentially making the same point as you here&#39;s what I meant: </p>

<p>The OP was questioning the figures. And, asking where they came from. In my first sentence I stated, &quot;Actually, I think the one thing that is correct, give or take several victims is the count.&quot;
Were you also not trying to explain that the 500 range number was also correct? I got the gist of that from your post, that hospitals do a lot of work to ensure the correct number is reported? As mentioned, my first sentence said just that. Or, were you only replying to simply correct assertions in my post like the difference between &quot;injured&quot; and &quot;wounded&quot;? </p>

<p>Hopefully, I have answered your questions. Again, many times I have stated I am not trying to start an argument. </p>

<p>I believe I have clarified what I was trying to say. If you feel the need to respond, that&#39;s fine. But, in the end, I feel this should be put to bed so we can all <em>work together</em> to get to the bottom of this injustice. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Please look at the context in which I wrote &quot;this happens quite frequently with mass shootings&quot; (not frequent mass shootings)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You <em>cannot get</em> from a very small &#39;sample group&#39; and &quot;average&quot; .. e.g.  how many &quot;mass shootings&quot; have their been to &#39;compare&#39; with each other? I suppose that also depends  upon what you consider a &quot;mass&quot; shooting to be, i.e. 5ppl? 15pll? 50ppl?</p>

<p>BUT REALLY WHAT MATTERS HERE IS THE COVERUP! <em>Whatever happened</em> in LV has be &#39;blacklisted&#39; by the Main Stream Media ... WHY?</p>

<p>You spent a HUGE amount of time, words and energy debating something <em>entirely</em> different which is aka &quot;derailing a thread&quot;</p>

<p>I <em>tried to</em> get you back into it BUT you just kept on with this ^ same shit</p>

<p>who GAF <em>exactly</em> how many people there were and why the numbers kept changing? I don&#39;t. BUT I DO CARE about the &quot;multiple shooters&quot; AND the FACT there&#39;s a freaking media blackout on the story!</p>

<p>Don&#39;t you? Obviously not. Why? IDK But I can&#39;t see ANY &quot;logical <em>reason</em>&quot; for yoou doing so, <em>except</em> maybe to fill in time &quot;at work&quot; lol</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do care. Please look at my Reddit history since the Oct 1 mass shooting. I&#39;ve been <em>posting</em> multiple threads to keep this story alive-- searching DAILY for new stories online. It&#39;s what I&#39;ve been spending my time on for months. Especially when I haven&#39;t seen anything on here for at least a week. I listen to YouTube independent journalists daily hoping and praying someone has posted something new, commenting on nearly every video. I take offense to your comment I don&#39;t care. Out of everything you&#39;ve posted, this is what really saddens me because you&#39;ve based your assertion on one conversation we&#39;ve had. I&#39;ve been a staple on this board since day 1. In fact, I&#39;ve been conducting my own investigation into Paddock&#39;s real estate purchases based on public information and auditor websites. Follow the money. </p>

<p>I posted one comment on this thread (actually a few more non related to the count) to address a question the OP asked. That&#39;s it. When you responded I simply tried to answer your questions. I wanted to clarify my original comment because you, yourself asked me questions <em>only</em> about the count-- I don&#39;t recall anything else to get the thread &quot;back on track&quot;. In my answer I apologized to you twice, hoping that would be the end of it in my first response. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not just dropping in this forum or just &quot;filling time at work&quot;. That&#39;s ridiculous. I want to get to the bottom of this desperately, and I think if you&#39;d do your due diligence you&#39;ll see that. It&#39;s really unfair of you to say that to me without looking into my history. I would never assume that about you.</p>

<p>So, as far as I&#39;m concerned that&#39;s the end of it. I hope we can now work together (as I mentioned previously) to get to the bottom of this travesty. Thank you for your responses. I hope to discuss something else with you in the future.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It appears the dominant method today to kill a story is first bury it with many other stories... and then just ignore it. There are so many &#39;threads&#39; happening today it is difficult just to keep up, let alone actually investigate any of them with any depth. This is being done deliberately. What happened to Seth Rich? Pizza/PedoGate? Awan Brothers? Or until Christmas the Hollywood sexual predators?</p>

<p>So what I wonder is this; compared to the False Flag of Sandy Hook (which was a drill they took live and no one died) which they milked and still milk today (in particular the Anti-Gun lobby), Las Vegas was swept under the carpet quickly (anyone wanna bet there will be LV survivors singing at the SuperBowl?) So then I wonder this. Was LV a planned False Flag that because it was quickly exposed in Alt Media they had to bury? Or was there something else to it? I don&#39;t buy the Gun Deal gone wrong... so then let&#39;s shoot up the town and thus draw attention to ourselves theory. That&#39;s ridiculous. Anyway I have not really investigated LV at all. Just felt like my time was better spent elsewhere. I&#39;ve investigated enough of the False Flag events of the past few years and decades to have no doubts they are deliberately created. See my article here:
<a href="https://truthshock.wordpress.com/2015/12/02/anatomy-of-false-flag-events/">https://truthshock.wordpress.com/2015/12/02/anatomy-of-false-flag-events/</a></p>

<p>The bigger question is what is the overarching agenda of these staged events?</p>

<p>I was wondering where all the videos of the wounds were and I found it. Video footage of the only one supposedly shot turns out to be bogus! <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YALTo5pJY-4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YALTo5pJY-4</a></p>

<p>New birds eye view of the concert floor. These guys in the Foundation Room should have been able to see or easily hear someone shooting but nothing, Just more confusion caused by SOUND. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shDNkLTIW-Q">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shDNkLTIW-Q</a></p>

<p>No sparks from any bullet impacts, zero. Look at ANY video you will not find one spark. Only sound. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIQfb6Kc_sg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIQfb6Kc_sg</a>&amp;</p>

<p>More evidence of not a single shot fired. No damage from alleged bullets. Some of those structures should look like a country road stop sign. No bullet forensics being done. They are just covering up any fake blood and other artifacts from the crisis actors. They also seem to be deep cleaning (scrubbing) up any fragments or debris from the water bottles with firecrackers in them.</p>

<p>Military sound projection technology + Firecrackers in water bottles to simulate the effect of bullet impacts.</p>

<p>Non-crisis actors were not fooled by this sound projection (like people with intimate knowledge of firearms.) You can hear them in this video. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIQfb6Kc_sg&amp;amp;#t=01m20s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIQfb6Kc_sg&amp;amp;#t=01m20s</a></p>

<p>So zero impacts can be found the next day? Not a single spark caught on video? How many rounds? 1000?</p>

<p>You now have witness enough to conclude that this was actually a hoax.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can say that, the one person I know who was there, was also there with his daughter, and her phone got left behind.   Strangely enough the FBI called some random person from her contacts she hadnt talked to in a long time rather than calling the contact &quot;DAD&quot; to return the phone.  Long story short.  the phone WAS NOT wiped.  Although I will add, that she did not do any filming of the event.  Take of that what you will.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The question still stands either way: why isn&#39;t anybody talking about it anymore? Lack of evidence would still be evidence. Just of a slightly different thing.</p>

<p>Any way you cut it, there should be evidence. Either evidence of a coverup, evidence that it went down the way LVPD/FBI said it did, or evidence that nothing happened. And there is lots of examples of how it could go all these ways, just none was put out there by anybody even remotely trustworthy.</p>

<p>So let&#39;s turn it around a little bit. If there truly is no evidence, why hasn&#39;t anyone with bonafide independent investigator cred (meaning, aside from random internet conspiracy theorists) come forward with evidence of the lack of evidence? These people, as you said, should be &quot;uncovering at least some of it&quot;. It should be really very frustrating to them that they aren&#39;t. Or, conversely, they should have come up with something interesting by now. Either way, nary a peep. It makes me think nobody really is investigating it.</p>

<p>For example: 1000+ rounds should have generated lots of bullet holes in the surrounding infrastructure, i.e. the stage, buildings, parking lot, etc. Yet we haven&#39;t seen even amateur pics of anything approaching 1000 bullet holes. Why is that? Could be because it didn&#39;t happen. Or it could be because nobody was able to get close enough to take pics of a bullet hole before MGM or whomever cleaned them up. But either one of these explanations is problematic. And yet nobody is talking about why that is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep, I’ve been watching for awhile now. It’s not just Las Vegas... Lots of people get pretty hostile over a handful of topics. Rather than discuss it with an open mind they go straight to hostility. </p>

<p>I honestly cannot decide anything about Vegas one way or the other. Not enough objective info, and you’re right the “movie” is damn sloppy. Like a senior film final project at a 3rd rate film school. </p>

<p>Although since we are on the subject of “movies”, I will say this: many if not most movies you think are good initially can’t withstand too much more thought put into them. The longer you think about it, the more plot holes you realize are in there. But as long as the explosions are good you overlook it the first few times for entertainment value. </p>

<p>One thing’s for sure... The official report should be entertaining when it finally drops. </p>

<p>for the sake of accuracy:</p>

<p>Not exactly sure what you mean by &quot;No victims&quot;, but:
Clark County Coroner already released the entire list of names of people who died.  And I even upgraded it with <a href="https://media.8ch.net/file_store/529cee584b1176a00a9af692b1ecbd0d6e10fdf0d4b2000a7ba636fab5140538.jpg">DOB</a> a few weeks ago.</p>

<p>Im not going to link to every sing interview, but there were many many survivors interviewed.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.tenone2017.com">This</a> site should be a HUUUUUUGE resource to anyone still actively researching the Oct 1 shooting.  I can not emphasize this site enough.  Its like the library of alexandria of the las vegas shooting, AND NO ONE KNOWS ABOUT IT.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s look at what that article actually said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Eric Paddock said his older brother was a multimillionaire, but he doubts that the estate will end up being worth $5 million. He suspects his brother may have sold his stocks, emptied his bank accounts and disposed of the money somewhere before the attack.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Eric Paddock said that what would be left of his brother’s assets — which includes two homes in Nevada — would perhaps total $500,000 to $1 million.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, Eric Paddock could be full of shit and some of it is just his speculation.  But the $5 million number is &quot;according to some estimates,&quot; and includes his real estate holdings.  What we do know is that Stephen Paddock was a gambling addict.  And he was not winning since some mysterious event in September 2015.    </p>

<p>While it is possible that he was sitting on $5 million in cash, it is also possible that his cash and liquid assets were largely depleted.  In any case, one thing is certain.  If he did have $5 million, and he was losing $2 million a year from gambling, then he would have $0 in 2.5 years.  In any case, rich people commit suicide, and I don&#39;t consider a total net worth of $5 million at 67 to be &quot;rich&quot; -- basically an above average worth for someone that didn&#39;t have kids.  One thing that eats your assets is kids.</p>

<p>Now, to answer your question &quot;Why do you commit a mass shooting and suicide when you&#39;ve got an estate valued that high?&quot;  For the exact same reason you acquired that estate in the first place.  Paddock had a plan.  His plan was to protect his the status quo, as it existed prior to September 2015.  The plan didn&#39;t work out and the mass shooting and suicide was the logical consequence of the plan, given that is was one of the contingencies.  Lombardo disclosed the FBI psychological profile and it explains why Paddock would commit a mass murder and suicide.  the FBI psychological profile would not be consisted with boating his way through retirement.  So while numerous other people could come up with useful ideas of what to do with $5 million, we need to look at what someone with Paddocks past history and psychological profile would do.  </p>
