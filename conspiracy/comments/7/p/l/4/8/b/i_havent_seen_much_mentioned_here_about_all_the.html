There&#39;s so many stories that seem somewhat believable yet far fetched at the same time. 
I&#39;ve seen stories about everything from people vanishing, to foreboding staircases in the middle of nowhere, to faceless people and wendingos. 
What is causing these mysteries? Why in national parks? 
I&#39;ve yet to find a decent documentary, or anything of the like. Any suggestions? 
It seems like it would be a pretty big deal if even some of the cases were actually true without any kind of media attention.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dave Paulides holds two degrees from the University of San Francisco, and has a professional background that includes twenty years in law enforcement and senior executive positions in the technology sector. David has retired twice and is now the director of the CanAm Missing Project. In 2004, he formed North America Bigfoot Search-NABS where his investigative and analytical experiences were invaluable in researching Bigfoot/Sasquatch sightings, encounters and behavior. He spent two years living among the Hoopa tribal members, listening to and recording their Bigfoot stories. The Hoopa Project is his first book, based upon his experiences in the Bluff Creek area of Northern California.</p>

<p>In 2009, David was conducting research on a topic in a national park and learned from off duty National Park Rangers that they had seen many people disappear in the parks, with significant efforts and press at the beginning. The searches usually stopped after a week with little or no follow-up and no additional press coverage. The ranger stated that people disappeared in areas that were unusual and many were never found. The information received from the ranger evolved into the formation of a research team headed by Mr. Paulides and the publication of six books about unusual disappearances that have matching associated profile points. David has been on countless radio and television shows. He is the executive producer for “Missing 411- The Movie”, a documentary about his books. This is set for release in early 2017.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As someone who loves reading all about ghosts and bigfoot etc etc etc, I can answer this one.</p>

<p>Basically, people find staircases in the woods. A lot of them are likely the remainder of the home that once stood there, but some people also report bad things surrounding these staircases.</p>

<p>IIRC there was an askreddit thread for park rangers etc, and this is something a few of them brought up. The fact that there were all these old staircases out there but the older veteren rangers would tell them to steer clear (and this could be nothing more than because the staircases are old and weak and someone could get hurt).</p>

<p>But yeah thats about the gist of it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s not the story here though. The tale is that it is just a random flight of stairs plunked down in the middle of the woods. </p>

<p>If you&#39;re talking about stairs leading into the ground, that&#39;s a different thing. Real deal basements require for foundations. If it&#39;s just a hole in the ground somebody dug, that&#39;ll disappear in just a couple years due to rain, erosion, and seasonal changes. </p>

<p>Dude, this is from a <a href="/r/nosleep">/r/nosleep</a> story. It&#39;s made up. When people talk about this in AskReddit they are just making a joke,  referencing the Park Ranger stories that were submitted to <a href="/r/nosleep">/r/nosleep</a>. The story says if you find a staircase in the middle of the woods and climb it, you disappear. Poof, you&#39;re gone. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK well,  they don&#39;t exist. It&#39;s not a thing that has ever happened.  Stairs are made of wood,  and when the floors go and the walls go...so do the stairs.  Plus, old old houses out in the middle of nowhere aren&#39;t two stories. They&#39;ll have a root cellar, sure. Usually dirt &#39;stairs&#39; maybe with a couple of wood planks going down.</p>

<p>Sorry if I still believe you and am getting fooled here. I&#39;ve got some land with 75 year old abandoned farm houses on it.  You know what&#39;s left? The rusted paper thin husks of a couple cars from the 1930&#39;s, shattered concrete, a pile of broken bricks that made up the chimney, and some random glass from windows,  Mason jars and liquor bottles. </p>

<p>There&#39;s no wood left, it was gone half a century ago. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In houses far away from civilization,  yes. </p>

<p>Nobody is building a goddamn concrete Lincoln Memorial style staircase in the middle of nowhere. They built one story houses. Their barns had hay lofts,  but it was all wood.  Look at how the Amish and Mennonite build today. They rarely have second stories on their homes and everything is made out of wood except for the foundation and chimney. </p>

<p>Again,  if you&#39;re trolling here, bravo. Staircases are made of wood and fall down very shortly after the outer wall of the house is breached by nature.  Even brick houses have wood staircases. But nobody 75 years ago was building brick houses out in the middle of the woods.  They use the materials from the local area.  How you going to haul a house worth of brick into the wilderness? By horse? Do you realize how long that would take? 75 years ago it took an entire day to get to the town 50 miles away. And that&#39;s on horseback hauling nothing, because you ain&#39;t trying to kill the beast because if you are moving out into the wilderness to build a home you most likely have exactly one horse, or less. </p>

<p>Again, if you&#39;re trolling here, bravo.</p>

<p>You&#39;re the one picking a fight with this guy for literally no reason. You&#39;re kinda being a dick when <a href="/u/bartfutt">/u/bartfutt</a> is simply answering saying what he meant. Then you put more meaning into it and argue for a paragraph with this he didn&#39;t even say?</p>

<p>What is your point? That he was purposefully misleading someone so they believed the story was true? Or does arguing with people online fill a void temporarily?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How you going to haul a house worth of brick into the wilderness? By horse? Do you realize how long that would take? 75 years ago it took an entire day to get to the town 50 miles away. And that&#39;s on horseback hauling nothing, because you ain&#39;t trying to kill the beast because if you are moving out into the wilderness to build a home you most likely have exactly one horse, or less.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>LMAO what the fuck are you even saying. People like you turn threads on reddit hostile where everyone has to defend and argue every little thing they type.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude, there&#39;s are over 100 threads on this subject, not just on reddit from park Rangers all around the u.s. so to say it originated on r/no sleep just shows you don&#39;t know or read everything, so in your own humility don&#39;t act like your an all knowing God and that you definitively know when and where something started.</p>

<p>In the end even if it started on r/nosleep, doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s not true. Obviously your not a scientific individual, or you would know anything is actually possible, every 100 years we invent or explain what previous civilizations either thought were impossible or literally were unfathomable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I lived next to Glacier National Park. People often die drowning, falling, etc. in the most travelled and safest areas of the park. The area beyond those are vast. I think a lot of those people died in accidents in areas not so often travelled, and animals consumed their remains, and the bones have been scattered or buried underneath years of pine brush, foliage, and just aren&#39;t visible unless you walk right into them. It&#39;s not hard to die out there for numerous reasons, especially if you are alone. We had around 3 million people visit the park. Add that to all the other National Parks and it&#39;s easy to get hundreds of missing people from accidental death, animal attacks, and probably a few murders.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Have you ever read any if the missing 411 cases? A lot of the cases simply can&#39;t be explained by falling, drowing, or animal attacks. One of the things that happens a lot in these cases are people of supposedly sound mind suddenly deciding to run away from their camp without bringing any equipment. They throw their phones, flashlights, and shoes into the woods and just disappear. And then after an extensive search, they can&#39;t be found. But then after weeks or months or even years, their body will turn up a half a mile from where they went missing in an area that had been searched multiple times, often with weird things like their clothes folded up in a neat pile next to them. Thats what makes these 411 cases so compelling. They&#39;re just so freaking weird.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I live near the Smoky Mountains and have heard quite a few people vanish from there, but I can only think of a couple times I&#39;ve ever heard anything on the news about missing people. Different events in and around GSMNP make my local news all the time because it&#39;s so close, so I should hear about lots of people disappearing, but no.</p>

<p>I have a couple theories:</p>

<p>Wouldn&#39;t surprise me even a little bit if there was a pretty significant number of people living off the grid in the area. There are lots of abandoned shelters and caves that would make good shelters. </p>

<p>A few years ago, someone happened upon an entire town that had been abandoned no one knew about, so it&#39;s feasible that there could be a homeless population in those mountains we don&#39;t know exists.</p>

<p>Some are almost certainly deceased and not yet located. </p>

<p>Others have possibly just moved out of the area or found housing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly in my opinion people disappear and are never found for a multitude of reasons, none with conspiracy. National parks are wide and vast. Many of these people who are lost are far from roads and trails. With hundreds of miles to search and sometimes very little clues people stay missing. They then die due to trauma, dehydration... then an animal scatters their remains over a few more miles.. Then the National Parks Service steps in and starts looking. They look over these miles and miles and find nothing. A week goes by with nothing. They call off the search. Why? Because to find this person it could literally takes three years of their operations budget. They can’t do that because next week some one will need rescued again.</p>

There&#39;s a good reason why the government has national parks protected by specialized teams of people and it&#39;s got nothing with preserving the nature – disrupting the exit node for these civilizations would lead to an outright war that would cause internal societal rifts and probably wouldn&#39;t go well for us top-surface humans.</p>

<p>For more on this, study ancient national myths about forest creatures/gnomes/fairies/dryads etc. found all over the world and pay close attention to spates of &quot;mining accidents&quot;, especially in China.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s pretty much how I got into it, too. </p>

<p>It all seemed like there was something he might be on to, until I read actual SnR people&#39;s comments and about his &quot;all roads lead to Bigfoot&quot; approach. </p>

<p>The bottom line is that there may be something there, but by trying to shoehorn everything into his crackpot theory, he&#39;s working <em>against</em> finding a legitimate conspiracy or criminal network. </p>

<p>I mean, really, I&#39;d believe in a criminal trafficking network first, if anything. IN fact, if I did believe in such a network, I&#39;d also not find it hard to believe in them hiring Pilates/Paradies...whatever to basically write these books and build a kook mythology around select disappearances(as well as unrelated ones) so that more rational people would stop trying to connect them for fear of being lumped together with this clear raging bigfoot kook and his people. </p>

<p>He is the <em>only</em> source on this &quot;missing411&quot; thing, which is a <em>huge</em> red flag. </p>

<p>But, yeah, that red flag may hide a legitimate conspiracy and may in fact be a part of it. From what I&#39;ve heard about his police history, it&#39;s not at all far fetched. </p>

Obviously not the faceless beings and clearly out there stuff, but it was the complicated and unusual missing persons cases that drew my attention. There are a few stories not related to the 411 stuff or the nosleep thread that I still find really interesting. There was a story I read a few years ago about a guy leaving a bar who left a voicemail with background noise of weird growls and unexplained sounds. he was later found dead miles away, cause of death i think was determined drowning. That was a real case covered by a smallblocal news statiom, ill try to find it and post links...and what also sucks is that its so difficult to even know what&#39;s real anymore when it comes to shit like this.
