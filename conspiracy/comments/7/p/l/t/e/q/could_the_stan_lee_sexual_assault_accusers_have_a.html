        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>In case you haven&#39;t heard, <a href="https://theblast.com/stan-lee-stolen-check-fraud-investigation/">shortly after his 95th birthday, Stan Lee claimed somebody stole $300,000 from his bank account.</a> <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5250513/Marvel-creator-Stan-Lee-95-accused-groping-nurses.html">This week, he has been accused of sexual assault in an article from dailymail.</a> First of all, DailyMail is known for posting fake news and being an unreliable news source. Secondly, as a student majoring in journalism, I can assume this article is fake when looking at the words &quot;a nursing company.&quot; Reporters can&#39;t be vague in their articles and must use proper nouns to talk about where the story happened. If the story were true, they would&#39;ve used a name like &quot;California Care Center.&quot; But most importantly, <a href="http://fortune.com/2018/01/10/marvel-stan-lee-sexual-harassment-claims/">Lee&#39;s lawyers said today people have previously attempted to extort money from Lee through blackmail.</a> I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a coincidence that &quot;accusers&quot; are trying to take some of Lee&#39;s money not too long after somebody stole 300k from his bank account. While these probably aren&#39;t the only instances, I can&#39;t help but think the same person could responsible for both of these recent events. Please let me know if you think I&#39;m overthinking this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is it also possible someone or several people are setting up a long game aimed at trying to milk his royalties after he passes away? At his age sadly it’s not a stretch to assume he will likely pass away in the next 5-10yrs, possibly someone digging gold will attempt to open lawsuits/sue while he’s still alive to get the process started. 
Just a thought. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sadly I won’t be surprised what you suggest ends up happening verbatim. 
I will say if it is manufactured they sure as hell got their timing right with the sexual assault allegations coming out in HW &amp; the #Metoo movement. Do you think it’s a stretch to think that wasn’t as organic as they’d have you believe? (Such as that also being a planned &amp; coordinated effort). 
By no means am I defending any of the abusers, just find it suspicious seeing as the amount of money &amp; connections HW has (being able to keep most all of the dirt contained this long) it would all start unraveling so suddenly starting with one of the biggest fish being called out (Harvey). Especially considering the lengths he went to keep stories buried &amp; employing Black Cube operatives to dirty accusers &amp; keep him insulated. </p>
