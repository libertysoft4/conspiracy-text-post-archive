        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I was wondering what this sub&#39;s thoughts were on wearing precious metals and jewelry. To me it seems many ancient civilizations wore a lot of jewelry and as the world &quot;modernized&quot; less and less are seen wearing jewelry. I understand the cost to purchase jewelry is high and seen as a luxury, but why and how did we get to that point?</p>

<p>Not only the metals, but also the &quot;precious&quot; stones. Not sure if any of you have delved into this or if it is worth looking into.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I love silver, Sterling. I wear a hand made sterling silver necklace from India, and a hand made sterling silver ring from Ireland. The only jewelry that I feel has &quot;spoken&quot; to me.</p>

<p>I find gold pretentious and gawdy as an ornament, I see it as it is meant to distract onlookers. Silver not so much.</p>

<p>I do not believe in precious stones as more than what they are, beautiful to look at with some more than others.</p>

<p>I do have quite a few stones from obsidion to tigers eye to turquoise, rose quartz and jade. And an amethyst geode. Shits pretty to look at.</p>

<p>I think I might turn the geode in to a paraphernalia apparatus. Now THAT would be beautiful.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Same.</p>

<p>The first rock I found that interested me was a huge, at least softball size, Amber. Like straight out of Jurassic Park. I was mesmerized. I let it be known and it was &quot;confiscated&quot;. I was crushed, but had an ever longing gaze for a beautiful stone. My favorite now is a blue agate; about a third of it quartz, deep blue ridging I found and had polished. When I used to play poker it was my card protector. No ones allowed to touch it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve read most of the replies. I&#39;m looking more for the benefits/effects of wearing these metals and stones on our bodies. I don&#39;t believe ancient civilizations such as the mayans and african tribes wore jewelry purely due to &quot;shiny and pretty&quot;. media always seems to dumb down previous civilizations, but we know that these people were smart and had goals/strategies for their people. </p>

<p>the comments also lend into the narrative that jewelry is goddy and &quot;humbled, respectable&quot; type people don&#39;t wear it, or that it is a feminine thing. </p>

<p>the way metals react to our skin was on my mind the other day and i thought this might be a good discussion here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Gold enhances the functioning of the upper chakras (third eye, throat and heart) and silver activates the root chakra and possibly the other two lower chakras. The gold should be pure or 22k to be able to feel it. Only a gram or two is needed to feel the effects, but the more the merrier. Cannabis and yoga make the affects of gold of silver even stronger. </p>

<p>Do some yoga, smoke some pot, and put a small gold coin or gold bar (you can get 2.5 gram gold bars on eBay for about $125) and you should be able to feel it. Do it on a full moon and eat some strong edibles and you will really feel it.  Meditate while lying down in the dark with gold on your third eye, throats chakra and heart chakra and you will be unfit a treat. </p>

<p>There is a reason why Indians horde gold in their temples and homes, and it&#39;s not because it&#39;s pretty to look at. </p>

<p>Gold captures the essence of stars when they die and explode into the universe. Silver has some connection to the moon, but I&#39;m not sure of the mechanics of how it works. </p>

<p>This is what led me into starting this convo, to see how others react to wearing different types of metals and stones.</p>
