<p>Ok in the last 24 hours you been going quite hard on the turfing. 100&#39;s and 100&#39;s of comments.  Maybe I was wrong about you not sleeping because 10hr ago it looks like you came back from a 6-7 hour break. </p>

<p>Now this is quite strange because you are just someone who sits at their computer for 18hours a day posting non stop about 1 subject. </p>

<p>One possibility is that your account is being used by multiple people to push an agenda. Possibly run by a PR firm who astroturfs reddit </p>

<p>Another is that you are one person, who is working overtime for a PR firm that astroturfs reddit. I kinda hope Im wrong on this because its not healthy to work these long hours. </p>

<p>Or you are just some person deeply obsessed with trump that you spend any time that you are awake posting on a conspiracy subreddit. I really hope it&#39;s not this because it would be very unhealthy for your body and mind. If this is the case, seek help. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are absolutely right.  By shills, I mostly meant heavy r/TopMindsOfReddit users.  We have a rule where we give them one chance to be collegial, then we ban them.</p>

<p>Our rule of collegial discussion (don&#39;t attack) is like kryptonite for users with poor intentions like shills.  It has created a truly remarkable Reddit conspiracy related environment.</p>

<p>One of our most important aims is to be transparent with our users (we leave up comments) and to minimize censorship (staying within the Reddit rules).</p>

<p>Also, note how much my comment was down voted.  I think the top minds are likely doing it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While that sounds good on paper, it can be pretty hard to distinguish between shills and legit users who are just skeptical. Could be a pretty good pretext for censorship also. Note that I&#39;m not accusing you or your sub of censoring anything, I&#39;m just trying to make clear how easily this rule can be abused.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You said censorship for having differing opinions takes place on that sub, which is far from the truth. Whatever motivates you to speak this misinformation is not a concern of mine, only that it taking place is recognized for what it is - Unsubstantiated bullshit, which you&#39;ve more or less proved for us in this particular case<a href="http://i1.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/583/040/cff.png">.</a></p>

<p>I get that now that admins told you guys to stop harassing polkadotgirl has put you in kind of a bind in regards to how you interact with organic users but you need to take a moment and realize that a lot of people see past these bogus numbers imposed on opinions that don&#39;t correlate with the narrative. </p>

<p>Combine with do-nothing job, a break in student responsibilities, the greatest conspiratorial human drama I’m likely to experience for decades, and you’ve got a powerful combination for endless posting on the internet. This shit is so much fun, watching the whole GOP eat itself alive.  </p>

<p>You tell me to get help but you’re spending time to trying to unmask a nonexistent (in this case) shill. Christ. Talk about lack of self-awareness. </p>
