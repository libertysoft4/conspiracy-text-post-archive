<p>Edit2: The conversation arose after Kyrie Irving stated he believes in the flat earth theory because he doesn’t like to be told what to believe in by others. Which I totally agree with, I guess just the round earth has always made more sense to me. (Not because that’s what society tells us) just logically I guess. I’m not opposed to the flat idea, just have never heard anything convincing enough to get behind that. </p>

<p>You said it, brother. There is a whole lot of this reality that is not understood, and difficult to make sense, especially as part of a whole, unified theory. What many flat earthers say, is that we don&#39;t really know what the earth or the earth system is, just what it is <em>not</em>: a 25,000 mile circumference ball, which spins in a vacuum and goes around the sun.</p>

<p>Sure, I&#39;ll bite. But first you must acknowledge that FE is right, and specifically, the feeling of gravity comes from an opposite force at what we call &quot;terminal velocity,&quot; then our concept of gravity is off and is not a nuclear force that we know of, or we are in some serious way, completely misunderstanding the role of particle physics in our universe. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is your turn to show how FE (or whatever you&#39;re proposing) is <em>better</em> than particle physics for explaining the universe. That&#39;s a very tough proposition, because that&#39;s the most cross-corroborated, measurable (and measured) field in all of human science and experience. You can&#39;t do much of anything at all in terms of explaining the universe successfully (and usefully) without appeal to that group of theories.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s exactly how I believe the whole globe earth psyop started: nations with powerful, rich,  and greedy groups behind them were sailing all over the place in 15th century to loot and rape everything they found. They could have found areas of land twice the size of our known earth and kept it for themselves, a massive breakaway civilization which could still exist today. They could have simply taken their flat map, wrap it around a ball and forbid anyone from ever stepping foot on the perimeter (Antarctica).</p>

<p>And guess what? We still can&#39;t step foot on Antarctica! The Antarctic Treaty is militarily enforced, signed by most powerful nations, all joining together for <em>World Peace</em>, never breaking it. You can take a cruise there or step foot on a tiny patch, but that&#39;s it. Otherwise, if this conspiracy is true, you and I and everyone else, is stuck here like in a prison.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure. The earth may even be a giant ball, but without a measurable curvature it would either have to be hundreds of times bigger than they say it is (8000 miles wide with 8 inches per mile squared of curvature), or this &quot;cell&quot; is flat, like many others on a polyhedron. If outer space is fake or unreachable as I believe is evident, what we call ET&#39;s could be beings from another cell. It piques the imagination. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/first-circumnavigation-via-both-poles-surface">Guinness</a> says the first to do this was Sir Ranulph Fiennes and Charles Burton of the British Trans-Globe Expedition. They travelled south from Greenwich, London, UK on 2 September 1979, crossed the South Pole on 15 December 1980, the North Pole on 10 April 1982, and returned to Greenwich on 29 August 1982 after a 56,000 km (35,000 mile) journey.</p>

Earth is a disk 26k miles in diameter, with an &quot;ice wall&quot; at the edges that prevent further travel. How far the ice supposedly extends no one knows.

    <div class="md"><p>The word for gravity comes from a word meaning heavy. So the effects of gravity are no more than heavy things falling and less denser things rising. You can merely observe its effects, and call it what you want, but gravity causing giant balls to form in a vacuum is just an unproven theory. Neither flat earthers or ball earthers can explain <em>why</em> gravity does what it does and where the force comes from. The attraction of things falling down might have something to do with another fundamental force of nature, electromagnetism. But to me, the issue of gravity is, ironically, up in the air.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Humans have detected gravitons now, so that&#39;s not just a theory anymore. Gravity is now unified into particle physics. That means if you want to throw out gravity, you have to throw out all the other theories that underpin particle physics because they work on the same principles. </p>

<p>That should be the number one reason to throw out the FE hypothesis: it doesn&#39;t comport with particle physics. Particle physics is by far the most cross-corroborated, tested and measured set of theories ever to cross the minds of humans. If a theory flies in the face of these theories, you can bet your balls it&#39;s not right. </p>

<p>If you doubt the underpinnings of particle physics, it is incumbent upon you to show how your explanation can do all the things particle physics can do (as an explanation) and more. If it can&#39;t do more or even the same amount of explaining, it&#39;s not as good of a theory. And therefore, it&#39;s nonsense.</p>

<p>And if my uncle had a vagina, he&#39;d be my aunt. What&#39;s your point with this? I understand that you feel like you&#39;ve been lied to. You have. For sure. Our government is designed to allow the most predatory among us to rise to positions of power. 9/11 was a serious turning point for this country. To me, that&#39;s the most heinous abuse of power we&#39;ve ever witnessed in my life. There are serious crimes that have been covered up for that set of crimes that amount to murder for money. JFK, murdered by a small group of CIA operatives running an off-books operation. </p>

<p>For sure, there are many more. The best way to tell where a conspiracy is is to look at where the money goes. And most of the money that we don&#39;t get to see goes to the Pentagon. Not NASA. Scientists and engineers are not the people we need to concern ourselves with, as a group. On 9/10/2001, Rumsfeld announced the Pentagon &quot;lost&quot; $2.3 Trillion dollars. Recently the Pentagon announced they &quot;lost&quot; another $21 Trillion. That&#39;s real money. That&#39;s more than the GDP of most countries. That&#39;s where the real power and the real conspiracy planners reside. </p>

<p>Ok. Did you want to expand on that? My response doesn&#39;t change. You&#39;re saying &quot;if the world isn&#39;t as we understand it from all the experiments that we&#39;ve done, then all our understanding of it would be wrong.&quot; Is that about right? If not, please clarify.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>my first reply started with me saying I was playing devils advocate.  You then go on to try and prove to me FE is bullshit (which i already know).</p>

<p>All Ive been trying to do is explain that IF the flat earth is true that our ideas of physics would be wrong and any proofs you have would be based on wrong science.</p>

<p>thats it.</p>

<p>you can&#39;t use our current understanding of physics to explain anything if we assume flat earth is real because if flat earth is real then our understanding of physics would be based on false information.</p>

<p>That&#39;s the real problem. Our current understanding of physics is by far the most solid theory about the world we as humans have ever developed. It&#39;s one theory we can safely say is &quot;true.&quot; We can safely build upon it with the knowledge that whatever we make from it is based on validated, cross-corroborated science. The only other theory that even comes close to being as well established is evolution, via genetics. As solid as genetics is today, it&#39;s not as well cross-corroborated as particle physics. </p>

<p>So, in your analogy, it would be like saying &quot;if we assume that shit tastes like pancakes, then everything we know about pancakes is wrong.&quot; Ok, in some limited way, this may be true, but it has no bearing on our reality. I don&#39;t care how tasty some shit is, it won&#39;t ever taste like pancakes. Period. </p>

<p>Maybe I&#39;m losing your point. Feel free to clarify. I&#39;m doing my best here to understand you.</p>

<p>So this is where you either have the most incredible evidence anyone has ever seen for redefining the shape of the planet, or this is just nonsense. Do you have evidence? Another video of a photo with a &quot;doctor&quot; talking over it isn&#39;t very good evidence. </p>

<p>Why is this so hard for you to understand?  </p>

<p>...WE ARE ASSUMING THAT THE WORLD ACTUALLY IS FLAT FOR THIS DISCUSSION HERE....</p>

<p>if we make this assumption for argument sake then what we currently know about physics is wrong.</p>

<p>period.</p>

<p>thats it.</p>

<p>im not trying to come up with any theory or evidence because that is not important in this discussion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s moot anyway because we have no way of ever knowing if something is infinite. Neither infinite plane nor infinite universe can be measured because we&#39;d either have to physically go somewhere infinitely or see infinitely far and yet still the end would be out of our reach. See how absurd that is? </p>

<p>I think it&#39;s funny people are called flat-tard for believing in a flat plane earth by the same people who believe in a flat ecliptic plane the objects in the solar system travel on around the Sun. I suppose we are all flattards, then. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The thing is nobody really knows how this place works.  We are 100% for sure not on a spinning ball in outer space.  Anyone who seriously looks into the moon landing will see that it&#39;s fake.  Then you can move onto the ISS and see they are using wires and Augmented Reality.  You can see the space walks are underwater.  So there is a massive deception and it&#39;s purpose is to hide the fact we have a creator.</p>

<p>So the reason we got into this mess was humans coming up with reasons why everything works the way it does when really they were just theories that were incorrect.  We build more junk theories on top of those and now we are living in a complete fantasy world where nobody knows what way is up and what way is down.  </p>

<p>People think it&#39;s more logical that humans are walking upside down on the other side of the earth and that they are spinning at 1000mph (but can&#39;t feel it at all) than we are on a flat and stationary earth which is what is actually experienced every day.</p>

<p>The modern education system is nothing more than the most successful cult of all time.  You pay absurd amounts of money to gain ranks (at lower levels you are forced to pay via tax).  Those lower in rank look to those higher in ranks for all their answers and simply trust they are telling them the truth.  At the top there are high priests like Bill Nye and Neil Tyson that they  borderline worship.  This is exactly how Scientology works and people can clearly see that&#39;s a scam but the modern education system.. nooo because they are apart of it.</p>

<p>So to answer your question, nobody knows what is at the edge.  It very well could work like pacman where you go west and just show up at the east because this place is created by a supernatural creator and nothing is &quot;too unbelievable&quot; when you realize this.  You just better realize that the creator is real and try to figure out who he is and what he wants because the entire world has been set up to make you believe he doesn&#39;t exist.</p>

<p>There is a spiritual battle going on for your eternal soul and most people have no clue it&#39;s even happening.  This defaults you into one camp which I promise you is the one you don&#39;t want to be in.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure he could have but he clearly didn&#39;t.  The reason the cult of false science claims the spinning globe is because it&#39;s a core part of the evolution of the universe and evolution itself.  Ultimately it&#39;s a religion where humans will eventually evolve to become gods through technology or cosmic spirituality (singularity/NewAge).  The same old lie of &quot;ye shall be as gods.&quot;</p>

<p>For example hire a plane, fly straight east from the equator, the northern and southern polar circles and the northern and southern turning circle. then measure the time it takes to fly with constant speed to reach the point from where you started.</p>

<p>When the earth isn&#39;t a globe, well then we should say good bye to you and you would end up in nirvana or anywhere... Oh well, i see, i figured it out, you&#39;re probably afraid to end up in nirvana or stumble upon the edges of the world and fall into whatever there is... Yes, now i know why you can&#39;t prove your point... ;)</p>

<p>and well... funny side note...

    <div class="md"><p>We are all sinners.  The difference is I have repented and belived the Gospel which is:</p>

<p>1Co 15:1  Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; 
1Co 15:2  By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. 
1Co 15:3  For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; 
1Co 15:4  And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures: </p>

<p>There is nothing for you to do because God did it all for you.  Just simply repent and believe the above and take it personally and you will be saved.  No church, no being a good person, no nothing.  Only having Jesus Christ&#39;s imputed righteousness through accepting his blood atonement can save you.</p>

<p>If not:</p>

<p>Rev 20:13  And the sea gave up the dead which were in it; and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them: and they were judged every man according to their works. 
Rev 20:14  And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death. 
Rev 20:15  And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe that FE states that the Sun and Moon are much smaller than we are told and far closer to the Earth...something like only a few dozen miles above the &quot;disk&quot;. Again- not an FE guy but it&#39;s what I recall from treading down that rabbit hole. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is your turn to show how FE (or whatever you&#39;re proposing) is <em>better</em> than particle physics for explaining the universe. That&#39;s a very tough proposition, because that&#39;s the most cross-corroborated, measurable (and measured) field in all of human science and experience. You can&#39;t do much of anything at all in terms of explaining the universe successfully (and usefully) without appeal to that group of theories.</p>

<p>So let&#39;s hear it.</p>

<p>I have explored. And read and talked and learned and wrestled with concepts. I know a good theory from a nonsense one. You can&#39;t even present one because you know how full of shit you are.</p>

<p>Have a nice dinner. Take that nonsense elsewhere.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you saying that gravity is <em>not</em> a weak nuclear force? What is your claim such that it answers more questions about the universe than current particle physics answers?</p>

<p>If all you can say is &quot;we don&#39;t fully understand gravity, therefore it&#39;s wrong,&quot; that&#39;s a textbook argument from ignorance. That&#39;s like saying &quot;we don&#39;t fully understand the universe, therefore God must&#39;ve created it.&quot; It&#39;s the same nonsense.</p>

<p>To avoid an argument from ignorance, you should supply a more reasonable explanation of gravity that incorporates the rest of particle physics as we know it--as well as the existence of gravitons. Of course, that&#39;s not going to happen here. You&#39;re just confused. But I may be wrong about that. I&#39;m all ears.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>2Ti 3:1  This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come. 
2Ti 3:2  For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, 
2Ti 3:3  Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good, 
2Ti 3:4  Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God; 
2Ti 3:5  Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away. 
2Ti 3:6  For of this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead captive silly women laden with sins, led away with divers lusts, 
2Ti 3:7  Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth. 
2Ti 3:8  Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also resist the truth: men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the faith. 
2Ti 3:9  But they shall proceed no further: for their folly shall be manifest unto all men, as theirs also was. </p>
