        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hi, first time posting here but I&#39;ve been lurking for a while. This post was inspired by Revelations of the Pyramids that I saw posted here by u/axolotl_peyotl and watched today.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7oqwc1/the_revelation_of_the_pyramids_2010_featured/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7oqwc1/the_revelation_of_the_pyramids_2010_featured/</a></p>

<p>I thoroughly enjoyed the documentary. It was very well made, well researched and utilised access to academics to, not necesaarily, prove a point, but indicate inconsistencies and innaccuracies in terms of what we know, or at least have been told, about the Ancient Egyptians.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t really want to spoil it for those who haven&#39;t seen it, that can be done thoroughly in the comment section, but basically the massive trove of mathematical coincidences in the Great Pyramid&#39;s geometry, the materials they used to build with and the supposed tools at their disposal ca. 2500BC make it seem unlikely that it was done as has been proposed i.e. using barges to carry granite blocks in excess of 100s of tonnes and then hauling them up ramps.</p>

<p>Based on how far technology has come along in a couple of hundred years in the Modern Era I see no reason why an ancient civilisation, like the Egyptians, could not have made every advance we have a few thousand years ago.</p>

<p>I&#39;m going to include free energy in this discussion because I think it exists based on my experiences looking at the sky and seeing stuff flying around that definitely wasn&#39;t a conventional aircraft.</p>

<p>Maybe the Egyptians and other ancient civilisations mastered the technologies we have (including free energy) and even a lot we have no idea about and then fucked off into space to see what was going on out there. Maybe these are the pilots of at least some of the advanced craft that visit us.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure there are plenty of theories out there. I&#39;d like to hear them. Supporting information would also be great, interviews, inconsistencies in historic or scientific reports that you&#39;ve come across, even assumptions, as long as they are logical and based off some sort of evidence.</p>

<p>Have at it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ingo Swann trained the military remote viewers at one point.  I have read a book by Ingo and he has a very interesting writing style as well as very interesting material in his book.  First book I ever read about remote viewing was by Paul Smith, one of the army remote viewers.  I wrote a little bit about it in my blog here (<a href="https://fosvis.wordpress.com/reading-the-enemys-mind/">https://fosvis.wordpress.com/reading-the-enemys-mind/</a>).  I recommend checking out Ingo Swann&#39;s book (<a href="https://www.wanttoknow.info/ufos/penetration.ingo_swann.pdf">https://www.wanttoknow.info/ufos/penetration.ingo_swann.pdf</a>).  That book was so interesting to me that I read it in one day.  I read that book <em>after</em> I read the book by Paul Smith... so seeing that in Smith&#39;s book Ingo is said to be very accomplished in his remote viewing abilities, reading Ingo&#39;s book and seeing what he wrote about and experienced was mind blowing.  Who knows if he was telling the truth in that book, but if he was, then all I have to say is wow. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s an interesting theory because the evidence for their discovery of advanced technology would be buried on Mars where we really haven&#39;t explored much rather than Earth where we have already explored ancient ruins extensively. Visiting spacecraft may not leave much evidence of their technology behind, but we see indications that advanced technology was <em>used</em> to construct megalithic structures.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think civilizations like Egypt and  the Mesopotamian societies may have possibly derived some of their masterful understanding of the natural world from previous civilizations we know nothing about, and perhaps those civilizations were as advanced or more advanced than we are now. It&#39;s improbable, but possible I suppose. I don&#39;t think Egyptians had spaceships and free energy, but perhaps they knew about flying vehicles and electricity. I think it&#39;d be more likely that they knew about geometry and the technology they implored because of ancient knowledge that managed to trickle down from a more advanced civilization before them. That civilization could have been as advanced as the west in the 18th century, or perhaps only as advanced as the roman empire, or maybe, although less likely, as advanced as we are now or well beyond that point. Who knows. We have so little to go off of with this theory, that it is little more than wild speculation, but I&#39;m certainly open to the possibility. It would only make sense for human civilization to arise in the past prior to some of the many natural disasters that could have nearly wiped them out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Imo you are right on about a roman empire level civilization from before the Younger Dryas event. In my opinion on the coast of the Indian sea/persian Gulf somewhere. That&#39;s why you get the Indus valley civilisation, Sumer/fertile crescent civilizations and some probably colonized upper Egypt via the Red sea and Gulf of Suez, then expanded towards the coast and the Nile delta as population grew. All the oldest egyptian cities and pyramids are inland in the Egypt/ethiopia border area, not on the coast by Cairo or Alexandria.</p>

<p>Also IMO, the place to find the origin civilization is somewhere on the bottom of the sea not far from the Indus delta, ie coast of pakistan and india.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesing theory.</p>

<p>I like to think that if a small group (maybe a few hundred) &#39;martians&#39; escaped earth, they could only do so on a space craft with limited resources. So they land here and survive with their knowledge of mars etc for what, three/four generations before their stories start to be twisted, mis-remembered and oops all of a sudden you have the makings of religion and all of those thousands of tales from thousands of civilizations.</p>

<p>I Believe in evolution, but i can&#39;t understand (somebody smarter than me please explain) why we lost our monkey feet and tails? Like, when would they not come in handy?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s true, generational distortion of facts don&#39;t take long.
Monkey hands and feet become a hindrance when you&#39;re sprinting across open plain. That&#39;s also the theory why we evolved into upright creatures.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>See, i have heard that before that human feet were good for running across plains. But, did all humans go around pretending to be Usain Bolt of early man? Didn&#39;t some humans stay in jungle/forest environments? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah the jungle dwelling folk certainly threw me off a bit. Monkey feet would be better for that, tails too. The four legged thing though, if we were quadrupedal then we wouldn&#39;t have hands like we do (hands that are really good for manipulating small objects). And if our front limbs were legs with functioning hands then there would be too high a risk of damaging them if they were used for movement (I reckon).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe there are missing pieces to the theory of evolution as well. If life is merely about survival, why evolve towards more complexity. Basic life forms are far more resilient to environmental changes than large mammals. Why not stay small and flexible. Why create languages, morals, and religions? Do they help with the survival of our species? If survival is the only goal, we should be like xenomorphs from the movie Alien; they&#39;re deadly killer that could spawn easily.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>12,000 years is a long time. And robbery is real. There are a few &quot;Egyptologists&quot; who are more like gatekeepers and who have in the past been known to deface and defile ancient sites and tombs to hide the truth behind ancient civilizations and maintain the mainstream theory on Egypt. It&#39;s been theorised that some of these Egyptologist families belong to secret societies.<br/>
Have a look up of the Dendera light hieroglyph as a good piece of evidence for Egyptians using electricity via wires. I personally think ancient Egyptians were quite advanced in science, though not exactly as we do science in some respects. They could have gone down a different path and put their attention and focus on different technologies. Sound resonance and light/laser tech for example. Could be applied very well in structural engineering, transport, and medicine, to suggest a few. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Basically what I posted above... Our culture is not too old, and we&#39;re closing in fast at breaking into the ability of coding our own genome, and building anything we want from organic structures. We&#39;re not there yet, but imagine if there were people like use here say 100,000 years ago. Whatever their culture became, it would appear incredibly alien to us, even if they were from Earth. So alien in fact to our understanding, that I theorize that, there are ancient people&#39;s around us, and shamans and priests have talked with them over the millennia. But the information on where to look is kept SUPER secret. Like if you find out even a tiny bit, it&#39;s a kill you, and everyone you ever knew, type secret.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That for is is completely unknowable. There are hints in all religions, but there is so much disinfo, it&#39;s hard to know where to start.</p>

<p>To begin with, the secrecy of the older religions, and their treasures libraries closed to the public, is a HUGE red flag that there is some super serious info that is not being shared with the public.</p>

<p>Beyond that it is all just conjecture, until you find proof. At which point you are likely to suicide, by shooting yourself in the back of the head twice... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They wouldn&#39;t hold it so closely or take it so seriously. I think that they would have no trouble destroying documents that details atrocities and anything that defames their scripture. </p>

<p>From their behavior it seems clear they are hiding something that they think is important for us not to know, possibly the truth about our history. Whatever that may be. For reasons such as to keep us under control in their psuedo reality of the dollar, oil, debt, and power. The knowledge they keep implies free energy, which would destroy the system of greed and control if given to the slaves. It may also reveal our true purpose, and why we are here. That is the knowledge that would free our minds, and that is why they hold it so close, because us being free is not part of their plan.</p>

<p>They are guarding the knowledge... why? because knowledge is power, and guard it jealously because they they want to keep their power. It&#39;s simple, and pretty obviously what is going on. </p>

<p>There could be ancient people of Earth all around us, and all we have left, are legends about old beings that live one with nature. Sooo many legends referencing the idea that, we are not alone. Even the Bible says something along the lines of, do not draw or discuss things, viewed below the sea, or in the heavens. Which is an obvious information control program.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No one said they lacked basic construction knowledge because they clearly didn&#39;t. But the Great pyramid isn&#39;t basic construction, the documentary explains how it&#39;s an incredibly complex feat of engineering and that the tools modern historians claim were used were likely insufficient. There are other coincidences and inconsistencies pointed out by the documentary as well as a heap more that aren&#39;t in the documentary. The aim of my post was to get a discussion going so if you&#39;ve got something constructive to add to kill the theory or push it in a new direction then go for it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure.  </p>

<p>The book of Enoch is a text written by a man named Enoch who is mentioned in the bible as one of Noahs relatives.</p>

<p>The book of enoch mentions many things that happened in the times pre flood
(pre flood because he is an ancestor of Noah) and in one of the sections, Enoch explains how there were fallen angels (he names &#39;Watchers&#39;) that came to earth to teach humans things that God never intended us to know (ex. abortion, astrology, etc.)</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Enoch#The_Book_of_the_Watchers">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Enoch#The_Book_of_the_Watchers</a></p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying that I am basing my personal theory only on The Book of Enoch and you have to also remember because, although Enoch the man is mentioned in the Bible multiple times, his book is not included in the bible, so it is important not to view it as a religious (christian) text but as a historical text. </p>

<p>Do some research, watch some videos about it.  It is really a fascinating text and I think that these &#39;Watchers&#39; might be the influence that was received by the ancient civilizations.</p>

<p>Also, Enoch is alleged to be the only human to not experience a death from this realm, as God took him straight to heaven. </p>

They themselves however had a much more peaceful population on their planet and some of Earth&#39;s people perverted their teachings to gain power over others instead of using it to be a service to mankind. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I reckon they had help from some of the humans left over with advanced knowledge from the previous advanced human civilization(s) that existed before the cataclysmic disaster of the younger dryas period.<br/>
Like imagine if some huge cataclysmic disaster happened today and some modern day engineers/scientists who had survived passed on their knowledge to some of the other survivors like some African tribesmen, as they would then also mutually pass on knowledge back to the scientists of how to survive off the land. Over a very long time an exchange of information like that could be misinterpreted as aliens/gods coming to teach of magical ways. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Have a read into some of the work of Graham Hancock if you yet haven&#39;t. He researches this exact topic and has been writing about ancient civilizations for 30 odd years now.<br/>
I do think aliens are real and they&#39;re here on earth, but I don&#39;t think they have a very direct role with humanity really. I&#39;ve done plenty of research myself into aliens and even seen a couple ufos, but it appears as though they&#39;re taking more of a bystander role in our human development. At least in this human epoch. Who knows, they very well could have had a more direct communication with the ancient human civilizations before the collapse, but it doesn&#39;t appear (in my personal opinion, at least) that they&#39;ve had much direct contact with humans en masse over the last ~12,000 years. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think governments have been back engineering alien tech from crashed craft since the mid/late 1940s. I don&#39;t think that any governments are secretly in direct contact with alien species. I would <em>speculate</em> that there may be <em>some</em> people at the tops of some super secret societies/secret elite bloodlines who may be in contact with some other small groups of other alien species (though that ventures into breakaway civilization territory, so it remains speculative on my part to suggest any more), but I believe that the general majority of humans - even within rogue military elements - are not in contact with aliens.<br/>
I do believe that there is a small minority of regular people who are in contact with the odd individual or small groups of aliens through &quot;abductions&quot; and such. But more like how some humans keep tabs on certain individual animals, like sharks and whales, for scientific research. Though obviously they would have a bit more direct communication with each other, as both humans and aliens are similar enough in conscious self-awareness to be able to communicate, whereas sharks and humans aren&#39;t similar enough in that respect to communicate. But I reckon of those individuals most of them can&#39;t exactly call up the aliens. The aliens just turn up when the aliens decide. Unless the particular human has developed their consciousness enough to project it out (psychically, essentially) so as to directly communicate. But I think then even they would be a very small minority of individuals within the small minority of humans who get &quot;abducted&quot; (note: I only put that in quotation marks because I don&#39;t really like the negative connotations that come with the word &#39;abduction&#39;).<br/>
<a href="https://youtu.be/xU7uZ4a7aGs">Here</a> is a <a href="https://youtu.be/2iHloKMY8lU">series</a> of <a href="https://youtu.be/OPpjQCc79HQ">videos</a> from an interview with a man who claims to have been abducted/was in contact with some aliens since childhood. I&#39;d also recommend the documentary &quot;Unacknowledged&quot; by Dr Steven Greer, which is on Netflix, for further info into the subject. I&#39;ve been fascinated by aliens since I was a child, so I&#39;ve done loads of research into it, and I still continue to. I can&#39;t claim to know much in regards to the larger picture and many specifics (I realise that in that respect of the bigger picture I truly know fuck all), but I&#39;ve certainly done enough research to know a fair bit more than the average normie, haha. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Indeed, the stuff he addresses can be quite polarising. Take it with a grain of salt definitely, as you should do with anything to be honest, but I believe he&#39;s definitely at least onto a decent theory. If you&#39;re curious toward the consciousness aspect of it I&#39;d recommend reading into Nassim Haramein and his theory on the <a href="/r/holofractal">/r/holofractal</a> subreddit. Also I would always recommend reading the CIA paper &quot;Analysis and assessment of the gateway process&quot;. It directly address the whole aspect of protecting consciousness from the holographic universe perspective. You could also watch the video on YouTube &quot;Itzhak Bentov - from atom to cosmos&quot;, or even better read some of his books: &quot;stalking the wild pendulum&quot; and &quot;a brief tour of higher consciousness&quot;.<br/>
Sorry if I&#39;m overloading with info haha, I&#39;m just quite passionate about the topic. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trying to remember the video I watched from the early aughts on the subject.</p>

<p>Guy was talking about human sacrifice en masse to higher dimensional beings, in trade for blood magic type abilities, or something along that line.</p>

<p>He also points out that the term city, comes from cite, which has some kind of connotation of rape or sacrifice.</p>

<p>My mother raised me to hear truth with my heart, so much of what this guy discussed rang close to true.</p>

<p>.. will try to hunt down this guys video, but honestly it&#39;s been years since I last saw it.</p>

<p>Edit: I remember one of the points made, was about the magic being used against humankind. One of the main rules for it is, you must tell your victim what you are doing, before you do it.</p>

<p>After spending the last 2ish years learning about ancient Egypt I&#39;ve come to the conclusion there has to be something being covered up.

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s good to always remember two things.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>History is written by the victor/information suppressionist.</p></li>
<li><p>All of science is based off of theory and tests. EVERYTHING is open yo debate, and new theory, depending on facts and info available.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Much of science is based rather loosely in proven fact.</p>

<p>One of my favorite theories about Egypt, is that the major names in the Bible, were all in Egypt. Names were altered and two separate histories created to make us think they were not one and the same.</p>

<p>Also interesting is the idea that there were not slaves in Egypt that built the pyramids, but skilled Craftsman. Yes, there was likely some kind of caste system, and passing of skilled trade within a family. Today, we couldn&#39;t get a company to build a similar pyramid, with similar supposed technology if we tried.</p>

<p>So there is NO true theory, on how the pyramids were made. Just many bad ones, full of assumptions, and holes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The monkey king myth is about a monkey demon going through trials to become an enlightened being like Buddha; it is not related to any technologically advanced past.</p>

<p>Ancient Chinese kingdoms did, however, regard their founding ancestors from the age of their version of The Great Flood as highly advanced people. One of the details I remember is a man going to the god realm to steal a pile of magical dirt that could multiply indefinitely. The people then used the dirt to build walls that could grow forever to ward against flood water. These are supposedly the same people who created Chinese written words, the only writing system created independently from Sumeria, Egypt, and Maya.</p>
