    <div class="md"><p>My concerns are what are the effects on infant/toddler development from today&#39;s recommended dosages.  One of the things that generated concerns about vaccines was the significant differences in dosage from pre 1986 vs now (<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Childhood_Vaccine_Injury_Act">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Childhood_Vaccine_Injury_Act</a>).</p>

<p>Once the fear of liability was set aside, it appears the vaccinations are driven by profit motive rather than safety standards.</p>

<p>I have wonder if there is a chart that contrasts profits from vaccinations to the number of autism cases.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, there have been zero studies on the long term effects of all the vaccines on the schedule combined. And you&#39;re right, you are no longer permitted to sue vaccine manufacturers directly, you must go through a &quot;vaccine court.&quot; </p>

<p>As far as autism, there are new studies that show that aluminum travels to the brain. Aluminum adjuvants are used in vaccines in order to increase immune response. </p>

<p>&quot;What actually happens is a type of immune cell called a macrophage (MF) ingests (called “phagocytosis”) the AANs. Eating foreign material is a primary function of MFs. When MFs detect bacteria or debris, the MFs eat it, and destroy it with enzymes.</p>

<p>The problem is that AANs are not digested by the MF enzymes. Consequently, the AANs remain inside the MFs for a long time. The AANs can persist for years. MFs that consume the AANs become highly contaminated with aluminum, and spread the aluminum wherever they go. And they go everywhere in the body.</p>

<p>The MFs travel across the blood brain barrier (BBB) when there is inflammation in the brain. The MFs, once loaded with AANs, act like a Trojan Horse and carry the AANs into the brain. This is harmful, because the brain is very sensitive to aluminum.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://vaccinepapers.org/vaccine-aluminum-travels-to-the-brain/">http://vaccinepapers.org/vaccine-aluminum-travels-to-the-brain/</a></p>

<p>&quot;On the basis of previous reports showing alum neurotoxic effects in CD1 mice, an additional experiment was done, and showed early brain translocation at day 45 of alum injected subcutaneously at 200 μg Al/kg. This study confirms the striking biopersistence of alum. It points out an unexpectedly delayed diffusion of the adjuvant in lymph nodes and spleen of CD1 mice, and suggests the importance of mouse strain, route of administration, and doses, for future studies focusing on the potential toxic effects of aluminum-based adjuvants.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26384437">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26384437</a></p>

<p>Now technically, autism is a label given for a conglomeration of symptoms. There&#39;s no lab test for it. It&#39;s a diagnosis based on a set of behaviors and neurological symptoms. </p>

<p>They&#39;ve found very high levels of aluminum in the brains of patients with autism.</p>

<p>&quot;. The aluminium content of brain tissue in autism was consistently high. The mean (standard deviation) aluminium content across all 5 individuals for each lobe were 3.82(5.42), 2.30(2.00), 2.79(4.05) and 3.82(5.17) μg/g dry wt. for the occipital, frontal, temporal and parietal lobes respectively. These are some of the highest values for aluminium in human brain tissue yet recorded and one has to question why, for example, the aluminium content of the occipital lobe of a 15 year old boy would be 8.74 (11.59) μg/g dry wt.? Aluminium-selective fluorescence microscopy was used to identify aluminium in brain tissue in 10 donors. While aluminium was imaged associated with neurones it appeared to be present intracellularly in microglia-like cells and other inflammatory non-neuronal cells in the meninges, vasculature, grey and white matter. The pre-eminence of intracellular aluminium associated with non-neuronal cells was a standout observation in autism brain tissue and may offer clues as to both the origin of the brain aluminium as well as a putative role in autism spectrum disorder.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0946672X17308763">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0946672X17308763</a></p>

<p>The question is, is there a &quot;safe&quot; level of aluminum? In my opinion, that would vary highly among individuals. Are there certain genetic factors that predispose a child to be unable to detoxify heavy metals as well as other children? Could that be why some children develop autism, and other do not? There&#39;s just no way to know, as there is nowhere near enough research into this subject, as first they would have to admit there was a correlation between vaccines and &quot;autism.&quot;</p>

<p>That&#39;s why if you choose to vaccinate, I&#39;d wait until your child was older, and do one at a time. I&#39;d also leave out any of the newer ones, and do the basics. </p>

<p>Also, this will likely lessen the risk of SIDS. Plenty more links within this article.</p>

<p>&quot;his is by no means the first report in the medical literature linking hexavalent vaccines to SIDS. A quick search on pubmed.gov will reveal quite a few others, dating back to an initial 2006 report published in the journal Vaccine titled, “Unexplained cases of sudden infant death shortly after hexavalent vaccination,” concluding after post-mortem autopsies that these were cases of “possibly fatal complications after application of hexavalent vaccines.”</p>

<p>In 2011, a study was published in Statistics in Medicine titled “A modified self-controlled case series method to examine association between multidose vaccinations and death,” found that based on the review of 300 unexplained sudden unexpected deaths (uSUD) following either penta- or hexavalent, “a 16-fold risk increase after the 4th dose could be detected with a power of at least 90 per cent,” and “A general 2-fold risk increase after vaccination could be detected with a power of 80 per cent.&quot;</p>

<p>Let me know if you have anymore questions. I have a lot of different studies and such bookmarked. </p>

<p>Polio is eradicated.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wrong</p>

<p>Polio has been reduced by 99% since 1988.  It has not been eliminated.  Diseases and and do make come backs.  Polio is still with us, just in the West.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You might as well get a shot for the Black Plague too</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.who.int/csr/don/02-november-2017-plague-madagascar/en/">That still exists and is currently a problem in South Western Africa</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>It makes no difference whether or not you get it because you won&#39;t be able to get it from anyone unless you travel to third world countries.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is not true.  One just has to have contact with some one who has had contact...and so on and so on.   One can get a disease with ever having to visit the location.  </p>

<p>Having known people who have died because they were not Vaccinated my stance on it makes perfect sense.  I also have a friend who due to not being vaccinated got sick and ended up being Sterile thanks to it.  </p>

<p>Even if there really was a link between Autism and Vaccines I would still make the same decision as the risk is worth it.</p>

<p>I also have a friend who did not get his full Vaccines and got sick in high school.  He is Now Sterile and is in therapy because of it.  He comes from a cultural background that values and places a lot of emphasis on having kids.  Not a real man if you do not have a lot kids.  </p>

<p>Looking at the numbers and the risks involved I would choose Vaccines every time.  The Risk vs Reward is all in the favour of Vaccines.  Even if one were to believe the majority of the negative about them...they positives far outweigh the negatives.  </p>

<p>So yes I would go for the full panel for my children.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is so much more nuanced of an issue than &quot;will you or won&#39;t you vaccinate your child?&quot;</p>

<p>First, which vaccine? One with an illness as serious as polio, or something far more frivolous like the roto virus?</p>

<p>So okay, let&#39;s take polio: where is polio still an active threat? What type of polio strain are we talking? How is that particularly dangerous strain passed to others? Is that a likelihood in one&#39;s present location? Has polio been eradicated and if so, where and how? Now let&#39;s look at the vaccine: is there a risk one can contract the condition through the vaccine itself? What are the other potential side effects of the vaccine? What is the statistical likelihood of those effects happening? Can I trust those facts and figures presented, or might there be a history of suppressing said effects? What is the vaccine&#39;s efficacy in the first place? How can I be sure of that, if the likelihood of exposure to polio is low in the first place? If the mom is breastfeeding, does <em>this</em> affect the vaccine&#39;s efficacy as well? Given that it does for most cases, then should the mother not breastfeed, or do <em>those</em> benefits outweigh that of the vaccines? Are there other potential side effects that can&#39;t be measured, like an overall weakened immune system? With vaccines that aren&#39;t polio-based, are some people immune to the condition anyway? Are there any possible benefits to getting the strain and having one&#39;s body naturally fight it off? Doesn&#39;t a vaccine do that to anyway (ie, introduce a weakened strain to build up immunity against more potent strains)? </p>

<p>Vaccines are a shitty game of probability. Everybody&#39;s weights and inputs are different, and each vaccine warrants its own consideration. Some may go for all; some for some; some for none.</p>

<p>One thing I didn&#39;t realize is that you can have any vaccine in a thimerosal-free version, and the aafp recommends it. Definitely worth doing as the quality of the vaccine apparently does not decrease</p>

Also they don&#39;t give much of a time window for vaccine damage to show up, an autoimmune disease induced by the vaccine could appear one month after vaccination, but nobody is looking for this in the trials, so it is not tracked.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have old parents and there’s 18 years between my brother and I.. When he was about 15 months, he got meningitis and has been severely disabled by this. He needs 24/7 care, he’s on a ton of meds for things like seizures, and virtually no motor skills, nor can he talk. Since there’s been a lot of things in the new the last few years about vaccines, my mom has wondered if those have had anything to do with his condition, maybe not necessarily with the meningitis... I’m really not sure. But I have noticed that after he gets a yearly flu shot (his doctor obvi requires bc $$), he has a larger surge in amount of daily seizures for almost a week after. He typically has 3-8 a day but I was witnessing 15-20, some small and some in clusters. I’m starting to wonder myself if anything could be related. </p>
