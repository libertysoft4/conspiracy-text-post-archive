        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I lived in Lakewood, NJ for over a decade and feel pretty sick about what is going on in that town. A few things stood out to me, mainly surrounding the way the orthodox Jewish people control the government.</p>

<p>BMG is the worlds largest yeshivah, with over 6,000 students. They spend 12 hours a day learning talmud, and nothing else. And yet, they managed to get themselves classified as a college, so they get $6000 per year, per student, in the form of pell grant. Tens of millions a year, with &quot;graduates&quot; that have zero skills.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beth_Medrash_Govoha">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beth_Medrash_Govoha</a></p>

<p>None of the 15,000 Jewish kids use the public schools, yet the entire school board is comprised of orthodox jews, and they have been consistently funneling money from the public school system, into their private schools. <a href="http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2017/08/why_is_lakewood_spending_32_million_to_send_kids_t.html">http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2017/08/why_is_lakewood_spending_32_million_to_send_kids_t.html</a></p>

<p>A big portion of that money is earmarked for special needs students, where they are paid $112,000 per year, per student, more than double the state average <a href="http://njleftbehind.org/2017/09/follow-money-way-lakewood-kneel-vaad/">http://njleftbehind.org/2017/09/follow-money-way-lakewood-kneel-vaad/</a></p>

<p>Hundreds of homes are tax exempt because they convert a room into a synagogue, costing the state millions in tax revenues</p>

<p><a href="http://www.app.com/story/news/local/jackson-lakewood/lakewood/2015/10/09/tax-exempt-orthodox-property/73641878/">http://www.app.com/story/news/local/jackson-lakewood/lakewood/2015/10/09/tax-exempt-orthodox-property/73641878/</a></p>

<p>Recently, a large mall was opposed because it was discovered that it would &quot;allow&quot; non-jews to shop there</p>

<p><a href="http://nj1015.com/lakewood-mall-plan-opposed-because-it-would-allow-non-jews-and-hanging-out/">http://nj1015.com/lakewood-mall-plan-opposed-because-it-would-allow-non-jews-and-hanging-out/</a></p>

<p>A search of &quot;lakewood jewish corruption&quot; will yield many more articles of similar nature.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The orthodox Jewish community here is like a fucking plague of locusts that come into your town, intentionally drive down property prices of everywhere the inhabit, buy the properties, knock them down and then essentially take over the town.  They tried with our town and it led to a years long banding together to resist them as if they were a fucking raider army.</p>

<p>The worst is that any complaint of this behavior is easily written of as antisemitism to anybody who hasn&#39;t experienced it first hand.  Read up on the town of Ramapo, read up on the town of Munsey.  These people have extensive legal knowledge, a huge amount of resources and a clear agenda.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s one I found by googling - Kiryas Joel is the Hebrew name of the Hasidic community in Monsey:
<a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/welfare-reform-not-for-the-orthodox">https://www.thedailybeast.com/welfare-reform-not-for-the-orthodox</a></p>

<p>&quot;Take the overwhelmingly Hasidic Kiryas Joel, the poorest place in America. As the Times reported last year, “half of [its] residents receive food stamps, and one third receive Medicaid benefits and rely on federal vouchers to help pay their housing costs.” And boy, do they have children: The median household in Kiryas Joel has six people, and the median age is twelve. Many of its men learn Torah full-time instead of working, and the community’s low high-school graduation rate would be even lower if its religious schools had real academic standards. These kids are hardly being “socialized to the world of work.” And it’s not just Kiryas Joel: back in 1996, at the heart of “welfare reform,” a full third of Williamsburg’s Hasidim received public assistance.&quot;</p>

Meanwhile, the mostly black and Latino students attending public schools could lose about 120 teachers next year because of a $15 million budget shortfall.&quot;</p>

<p>Yea, that is really fucked up. It sounds just like that jewish district in NY, think Bronx area. Same shit, using public funds for their jewish students but public school kids get screwed on textbooks and stuff. </p>

<p>The orthodox jews have sparked my interest lately with all this doomsday stuff coming out about jewish prophecy and their 3rd temple.... I grew up with a lot of jews at my school, but never had problems in my area. I was friends with many of em, and crushed on a few of the girls (who doesn&#39;t love green eyes and a curvy waist). But they were the &quot;reformed&quot; kind so basically barely jewish, not orthodox.  People give muslims a lot of shit, but there is honestly very little difference between a conservative muslim and a orthodox jew. Same types of dietary restrictions or seperation of sexes. Kinda scary how much influence they have and how much they try to isolate or treat others instead of coexist. They wanted that jewish mall to not have &quot;outsiders&quot; and make all the stores close on Saturday... that is just ridiculous. </p>

<p>And regarding the tax exemption for prayer room... if I got a hindu temple in my house does that mean I qualify lol? </p>

<p>Also... this name for one of their special needs schools &quot;“The School for Children with Hidden Intelligence”.... I hope their headmaster isn&#39;t named Xavier and we bout to be overrun with jewish kids with mutant powers. Normally I would think that is just a joke, but lately I have been thinking bout all the discussion regarding symbols and words having real power behind it and I dunno anymore. Even moreso cause I have started to see symbols and patterns hidden in artwork after studying some esoteric books and sacred geometry, there is so much hidden in plain sight that it really makes you think what is going on there. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As someone who lived in Ocean County for 30 years before moving away I can confirm most of the scandals in the OP. The thing to understand about Lakewood is it has always been a crap town full of moochers and thieves. It was actually in worse shape decades ago before the Jews took it over. If you knew what Lakewood looked like in the 80s and 90s it was almost as bad as Camden and worse than Asbury Park. The crime was outrageous and many buildings were abandoned and boarded up. The town was ripe to be taken over and fixed up. The Jews actually made it nicer than it was before.</p>

<p>The problem is the scams they pull especially the way cheat on their taxes by having their home designated as a tax exempt synagogue. That crap needs to stop but I doubt it ever will.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A post I made about Lakewood a few months ago. There is so much more but these are just a few things I&#39;ve experienced.</p>

<p>I have spent a lot of time in Lakewood. My father does a lot of business there and through working with him I have been inside thousands of homes in Lakewood. It is a different world. If a child lives in the house then they aren&#39;t allowed to have a television. It used to be that none of the homes had internet but now that is changing. However, there are still schools that won&#39;t accept your child if you have internet in your home. The parents sleep in beds separated by a nightstand. The really forward thinking Jews in this community will have the two beds pushed together, but that is very rare to see. The married women have to shave their heads (they are not allowed to show any feminine beauty). The women are allowed to make very few decisions; it is a completely chauvinistic society. The men pray every morning and thank God for making them male and the women pray every morning and apologize for being female. The average woman probably has 7-8 kids. It is one thing to want a big family but I have a hard time believing that the average woman in this community wants to give birth 7 times over 10 years. Divorce is almost unheard of and extremely looked down upon. Almost all marriages are arranged and there is a growing problem with birth defects because a lot of marriages are between first and second cousins. That is the weird cultural stuff that I have seen.</p>

<p>Now for the fraud. Twenty-six people were arrested a few months ago for defrauding government assistance programs. Thirty-two million is spent on the education of 361 special needs children. The founder of the largest private school for Jewish special needs children was arrested earlier this year for stealing $630,000 of public money.</p>

<p>The Jewish students receive busing to private schools paid for with public money. Not one Hasidim child goes to public school. However, the Jewish community has the town in a tough spot because they could threaten at any time to send their children to public schools and completely destroy the town&#39;s school system. The 6,300 non-Jewish public school students are really suffering. The town pays $27 million to bus its students, more than it pays for classroom education. The middle school and high school have been merged into one building. The high school has cancelled all sports. And the one thing that gets me the most is that the Jewish families send their children to school on days like Thanksgiving and Christmas and therefore force the bus drivers to come to work on these holidays. There is a sentiment in this community that they are Jewish and nothing else. They don&#39;t really consider themselves American, even though this doesn&#39;t stop them from throwing their weight around in elections. I have seen several auto-accidents between two Jewish people where they exchange information and just drive off. In their mind, it is better to solve issues like that within the community and there is no reason to alert the authorities.</p>

<p>To end on a good note. My experience with thousands of families in this community has been overwhelmingly positive. I am always treated respectfully to my face. You do get a sense that they think less of you because you are not Jewish. An example of why I feel this way is on countless occasions a child around the age of five will come up to me and giggle and ask me, &quot;Are you Goyim?&quot; I can imagine that children are taught from a young age that they are the chosen people and special and everyone not like them is lesser. Of course they have to tell their children that in order for them to buy into the life of mindless obedience that their extremist views on religion dictates. However, it is refreshing to see children outside playing and not sitting in front of the television. It is amazing to see how close-knit the families are. Girls from the age of thirteen are responsible for helping raise their younger siblings because there are so many children that the mother can&#39;t possibly do it on her own. I look at these young girls and realize that they have more responsibilities than me in some ways. There aren&#39;t a lot of drugs. They don&#39;t drink a lot. It is very rare to see a Jewish person in Lakewood smoking a cigarette. They live an indoctrinated and sheltered life so that they can maintain a strong nuclear family and overall it seems to work for them. I can understand why Jewish people want to stick to themselves with the persecution they have suffered throughout history. It is a complicated issue and I don&#39;t know what&#39;s right but there are innocent people in Lakewood, especially public school students, that are suffering because of this Jewish community.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The wires are called eruv. It allows them to do certain things within the boundaries that they otherwise wouldn&#39;t be allowed to on Shabbat. My favorite are Shabbat lamps. They are these cylindrical lamps that they leave on but can spin the outer portion to cover up the light. This is because they can&#39;t use a light switch because they regard that as &quot;work&quot; and you can&#39;t work during Shabbat. Another thing, during Passover they aren&#39;t allowed to keep something like seven different types of grain in their house. They don&#39;t want to part with expensive items like certain whiskey so they sell it to their Rabbi during Passover and then buy it back after the holiday is over. But I agree with your point, why observe these restrictive rules if you are just going to find a loophole to avoid them. It is an admission that the rules are foolish. But that isn&#39;t the point of the rules. The rules are in place so that their lives are dictated for them so that they don&#39;t have time to think about anything else besides religion. It is brainwashing. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>Hasidic Jewish women are required to cover their hair. They use tichels (a headscarf, tied differently than a Hijab), hats, or wigs. Some women choose to shave their heads, because it&#39;s easier to cover a naked scalp than to pack all your hair inside. It&#39;s not required by any means. For women with thin or short hair, they actually sell shapers and stuffing to pad out the tichel. Some non-Hasidic Jewish women also cover their hair.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No worries! Most people don’t have a lot of experience with the culture. Frankly the super nice wigs never made a ton of sense to me—they don’t exactly do much to hide beauty—and Orthodox Jews I know just shrug as well. There are times where I wish I wore a tichel though. Seems like it would be easier than doing my hair! It draws too much attention and too many questions for me to seriously consider it as a secular person, but it is one of my favorite head scarf styles. </p>

<p>Are you saying that they don&#39;t believe what is written in their holy book?  <strong>First you said it wasn&#39;t true</strong>, now you&#39;re saying jewish people don&#39;t generally believe it.  My main point was that Jews do not believe Jesus was a prophet, correct?  But Muslims DO.

    <div class="md"><p>Jews do not believe Jesus was a prophet in general. There are actually sects of Jews that believe he was. The Talmud is not the Jewish holy book, and there is nothing about Jesus in the Jewish holy book, because Jesus did not exist when it was written. The Talmud is, in a general sense, rabbinic commentary, both on the Torah specifically and beyond it. Most Jews have not read the Talmud. Most Jews have never had access to the Talmud as a physical text. And most Jews do not follow the law of the Torah in any exacting (or even general) way, let alone the writings in the Talmud, which, as commentary, are contradictory and span from before the common era to the fifth century. </p>

<p>I do agree that Muslims are more similar to Christians than Jews are. I do not think that makes Muslims better than Jews. I do not think that makes Jews better than Muslims. I do not think that makes Christians better than either, or vice versa.</p>

Gut public school funding and re-route that tax money to voucher programs which fund religious aka alternative, private schools. </p>

<p>I don’t agree with what these Orthodox Jews are doing — but this really is no different from what happens in the Bible Belt. It’s just a different set of religious people doing it. </p>

<p>This is a rot in our country. We should be promoting critical thinking as the number 1 subject in grade school.</p>

<p>To focus this practice of re-routing federal and state funds mainly on Orthodox Jews is ludicrous. It reeks of an anti-semetic kink which a fifth of this sub seems to have. Yes, hardcore religious Jews do this in the US — BUT HARDCORE RELIGIOUS CHRISTIANS PAVED THE WAY FOR THEM! And they are pushing us further down this path! </p>

<p>If you don’t like these Orthodox Jewish schools, then focus your furor on the separation of church and state when it comes to education in the US. Promote critical thinking and civics. If that that sentiment doesn’t come out of your debate then you’re just a tool. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely, fully agree with you. I saw someone the other day make an argument that all children in the United States should have to go to public school--as in, no private school options.

    <div class="md"><p>Personally, I advocate for physical retaliation and intimidation, which most people do not agree with, and understandably so. I mean, they are doing it as well. I feel that way because in situations like this, where an American city is overrun and laws are loopholed (&quot;technically legal&quot;), such as in Hamtramck, Mich., there doesn&#39;t seem to be another option. When most officials of that city are of a majority religious cult, bending the laws and siphoning the people, there isn&#39;t a way for the people to legally go about &#39;changing the law&#39; or reclaiming their city. I guess we should just allow an American cities to be completely changed, because we don&#39;t want to offend anyone, right?</p>

<p>But you&#39;re not talking about offending people, your entire point is that you are talking about threatening, hurting or even killing people. And yeah, shockingly, people don&#39;t usually support those ideas. And that has nothing to do with offending anyone or political correctness.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you missed the point.</p>

<p>Why should I have to talk about offending people? My opinion of a cult-city is offensive as is. Offending someone is already implied, especially if a white male says it. And going about it legally will do no good since those in power (cult leaders) do not allow it. What other option is there?</p>

<p>These people are already meeting opposition with aggression. They harass and run people out of town who they don&#39;t agree with. Why not answer the call with the same action? It&#39;ll be quicker and a more satisfying result, in my opinion. I&#39;m not saying kill people. I&#39;m saying don&#39;t be a push over. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So...moving in, filling up the school board, exerting legal pressure, and protesting peacefully? Taking advantage of legal loopholes and good lawyers to push a point? Writing letters, shunning certain businesses? They’re not stalking people and beating them up. The best way to break up any cult is through education and choice. I mentioned in another comment an idea I saw recently that basically would require all children in the US to attend public schools, ending private schools. While I’m not 100% on that (though I’m happy to discuss—I can see both sides of it and find it interesting), that exposure to different culture, to American norms, combined with the freedom of choice that education affords (let’s see how far you get outside your community without a high school education) is crucial to breaking up an authoritarian religious cult.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I agree with all of your points, including those at the end. But when proper legal action has no effect, what&#39;s left? On top of that, legal action is a very time consuming process. Action is needed now. </p>

<p>Did i misunderstand the education problem in Lakewood? It seems as though they are doing away with public schools entirely and promoting private schools. Other actions are also taking away from the taxpayer. They are not working. They are not contributing.</p>

<p>And yes, they do stalk people and beat them up. Michigan is an example of that. Christians, who did not dominate city official positions, were run out of the town, spit on, had rocks thrown at them, etc. How do you combat that legally when the violators cover their face, or when city officials are part of the cult? And before anything is said, I believe in separation of church and state.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nope, the public schools exist. The township is not entirely Hasidic. There are about 6300 kids in public schools and 30k Hasidic children in private education. The state allots money to allow children with disabilities the chance to have a school that can actually teach them, and the lawyers argue the public schools cannot. This is actually a good law. There are plenty of public schools that are unable to accommodate various special needs, and it often makes sense to have a specialty school cater directly to these children. The expansion of school choice will only worsen these problems, but that’s another conversation. </p>

<p>About half the residents of town are on food stamps, and many rely on Medicaid. The women work paying jobs and the men are primarily scholars—a noble ambition, but not one with a paycheck. Frankly, I have my own feelings on healthcare in this country, but as far as food stamps go, that’s a drop in the bucket.</p>

<p>I don’t know anything about Michigan in order to be able to speak to that, but the short answer is that assault is illegal, and frustrating though it may be (I work in a law office, I get it), the law is the only way to handle that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Those lawyers are part of the cult. Of course they would say public education is unacceptable. When it comes to the state handling inefficient specialty education, at least the taxpayers would have a say. In this case, they do not, even if their taxes pay for these private schools. I&#39;m confused, are you siding with privatizing schools to cater to this cult?</p>

<p>As far as food stamps and medicaid, dude wtf. The men go to school indefinitely and receive govt assistance and have only one source of income for a household of 6-10?? I, nor anyone in my family, would receive this kind of help, even when my mother was diagnosed with cancer. There were only four of us. Fuck that. I barely break even at the end of every month. This is abuse of the system.</p>

<p>And since law enforcement is most likely paid off, or not even around for that matter, what other choice is there to combat this shit? They take matters into their own hands anyways and have no use for law, why shouldn&#39;t the citizens opposed to this cult be allowed the same reaction?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’m siding with privatized schooling existing for special needs children and for state money to be made available for them. A lot of public schools just aren’t able to accommodate children with learning disabilities. This town is definitely taking advantage of some loopholes, which I thought I’d made clear is unacceptable. </p>

<p>I think you should’ve applied for food stamps when your mom was ill if you couldn’t afford to eat, and if you qualify now, you should apply. The money is there for you to be able to afford to eat. If you are having difficulty doing so, then please, apply. You can’t eat pride.</p>

<p>Other options include making a big stink in the media. Especially lately this is very effective and can spur action. Video helps. The attorney general has power to act if they’re so motivated. If something like this is an issue, contact them. They cave to public pressure. But do not make the mistake of assuming a group of people in Michigan are the same group of people that are in New Jersey. If a Christian in Wisconsin throws rocks at me, what justice is there in throwing rocks at a Christian in Alabama? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We did apply for those things, but were denied. Clearly the money is not there for us, but is instead for people like this. 10 kids and a &#39;scholar&#39;.

<p>As far as making a stink, wouldn&#39;t want to be considered politically incorrect or intolerant now would we? Seems that is the only response from media to situations like this. And who owns the AG? Like anyone up there works for The People. </p>

<p>I think your last analogy is incorrect and does not apply to this situation. That would be an isolated crime. This pertains to large groups of people conducting acts of aggression on those they do not see as the &quot;Chosen People&quot;. Which, to me, is a hate crime on a mass scale.

    <div class="md"><p>I mean as far as I can tell, issues of assault and whatnot were limited to what you described in Michigan. I haven’t found any descriptions of that in New Jersey. Those people are literally different people. They might look similar, but that doesn’t make them the same.</p>

<p>I can relate to your issues—I was previously unemployed, in debt, with no money, and still couldn’t get Medicaid. With my current budget I have just over $100 leftover at the end of the month after paying bills, and while I’m fortunately lucky enough to have savings, it’s very stressful. Any emergency could ruin me. </p>

<p>I was recently doing a lot of reading on the FLDS. A coworker who just left was obsessed and lent me a lot of books. They’re still operational, and I see similarities to cultures like this. It took a lot for prosecutors to actually consider prosecuting, and the FLDS “owned” their towns a lot more than these Hasidic people do. </p>

<p>Unfortunately (and fortunately!) part of the beauty of the US is that people are allowed to be much different than you or I, and they’re allowed to shape their communities in that way to a certain extent. On the flip side, what that town of people are doing doesn’t have much of an effect on how you or I live our lives, and that’s also important to remember. Sometimes it helps to step back. Did you know that Orthodox Judaism in America is shrinking? Only 10% of jews in America identify as orthodox. 17% of millennial raised orthodox are no longer orthodox. And Hasidism is a subsection of orthodoxy—they are a fraction of 10% of an already small population.</p>

<p>You and I are financially in the same boat.</p>

<p>That church is also a damn cult. I can agree with you on the similarities. 
Separation of church and state. No religious cult should have legal authority over a population.</p>

<p>Yes, that is the beauty of the US. But we have one law, and it is not to be undermined by religious extremists. Right now, it doesn&#39;t affect you, but soon, if we&#39;re not careful, we will look like France or Germany. These people do not see &quot;the certain extent&quot;. They only see forcing their laws to the fullest. You will assimilate without even realizing it. Then it WILL affect you. How do you think the people opposed to the cult feel? It affects them on a daily basis. Put yourself in their shoes. </p>

<p>In any case, the Orthodox ones, even while not being of thr last tribe - bought into a shit religion that tells them everyone else is literally beneath them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was born into a family that practiced mostly reform Judaism, my father side is one of the most revered families of orthodox Judaism in the US, and, on my mothers side i have an aunt who married a Hasidic man, they live in Brooklyn and have i think 11 kids. I dont speak to either side of the family anymore, nor do i practice any form of formal religion. </p>

<p>Now that you have a little background, lets delve into some definitions and discuss what Juadaism is, has become, and is not. </p>

<p>There are several main branches of Judaism, in ascending or or strictness the movements are Reform, Conservative, Orthodox, and Hassidic, these main categories all have some subdivisions, specifically the Hassidic movement and sub sects like Satmar, Belz, Lubavitch, are dynastic religious orders, these sects tend to be the most isolated from the outside world and strictly adhere to dress, behavior, observance and other formal religious practices. The Satmar have long been known and feared for their zealotry. </p>

<p>As far as &quot;jews running the world money, banking, media&quot; meh,its easy to point fingers, sure their are some wealthy evil jews. Theirs plenty of evil to go around. </p>

<p>Jews molesting other jewish kids ? I have heard of this through news stories, and a few films, i haven&#39;t personally experienced any of this, but i believe the stories to be true, and the coverups and denials and &quot;amputations&quot; to be true as well, i have met some of these amputees myself, and yes, their lives can be ruined, their meager wealth stripped and families ripped apart by the rabbis if one should stray from the rules. </p>

<p>Money, welfare, and school vouchers, yes this is a huge issue now in Israel, previous to about a year or two ago, only secular jews, those men who weren&#39;t in a relgious school, were drafted into the Army, this was initially done to raise and protect a new group of scholars after the destruction of WW2 (don&#39;t start the denials, thats another thrsad for another day) obviously that has lead to a lot of elegible men not serving, that changed and sparked riots as men were conscripted. These scholars are supposed to only learn Torah, so yes they are raised with almost no outside knowledge, minimal math, reading and science skills, and yes they have learned how to manipulate social programs and government money for schools. Yes, this diversion of public money to private schools is hideous and i think unconstitutional (seperation of church and state - no religious organization of any kind should be recieving government assistance - public money- for anything. And yes, this is exactly the types of things that the christian right and muslim groups have been doing as well. In America, if a group can concentrate its members into a very specific geographic area, that group can come to weild tremendous economic and political power by voting its members into all locally elected positions, think school boards, city councils, alderman, zoning, etc once a group controls the local beuracracy its easy to direct where the money flows. </p>

<p>Zionism and all the rest.... 
I suppose if one wants to find a conspiracy then thats what they believe. Personally i find a centuries long conspiracy a bit much to swallow. Their are plenty of foolish, theiving, power hungry religious fanatics in any age and always more than enough to go around from every segment of religion. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We did apply for those things, but were denied. Clearly the money is not there for us, but is instead for people like this. 10 kids and a &#39;scholar&#39;. I still do not qualify, because i make a hair above the qualification. Trust me, my pride has long since dissipated. </p>

<p>As far as making a stink, wouldn&#39;t want to be considered politically incorrect or intolerant now would we? Seems that is the only response from media to situations like this. And who owns the AG? Like anyone up there works for The People. </p>

<p>I think your last analogy is incorrect and does not apply to this situation. That would be an isolated crime. This pertains to large groups of people conducting acts of aggression on those they do not see as the &quot;Chosen People&quot;. Which, to me, is a hate crime on a mass scale. I&#39;m specifically criticizing these types of cities. They do not change us. They must assimilate.</p>

<p>Edit: I&#39;m sorry. I&#39;m an angry individual. No anger towards you, dear Redditor.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very similar, yes. Rooted in Europe in the 18th and 19th centuries then spread, it was basically a response to reform judaism and a movement of people saying they&#39;d stick to traditional beliefs and lifestyles. They&#39;re just much more urban than the Amish.</p>
