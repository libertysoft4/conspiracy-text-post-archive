        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Consider the following two situations:</p>

<p>Spouse A pulls in 100k/yr and it is enough to support the family, spouse B is a homemaker and does cooking, child rearing, cleaning, etc.</p>

<p>OR</p>

<p>Spouse A pulls in 100k/yr, and spouse B pulls in 60k/yr. In order to support the family, they have to spend 30k/yr on daycare, take-out / eating-out, a cleaning service, etc. After taxes, the marginal increase to discretionary spending is something like 10-15k/yr.</p>

<hr/>

<p>In the first scenario, the family pays income tax on 100k/yr, but day-to-day running of the family is mostly untaxed as the homemaker raises the children, makes dinner, cuts hair, cleans the house, and a dozen other things.</p>

<p>In the second scenario, the family pays income tax on 160k/yr, and pays sales tax on ~30k worth of eating out, haircuts, childcare, etc. In addition to that, all the people providing those services are each in turn paying income tax on their labor and corporate tax if the companies providing the services are profitable.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Moral of the story is, the movement towards a dual-income family model has made it so the government can tax the labor of many more adults. Before, the homemaker&#39;s labor was effectively untaxed -- as it wasn&#39;t being resold but kept inside the family. After, that labor became taxed, also became part of the GDP (which looks good for government?) and bolsters employment numbers (looks good on government reports).</p>

<p>In addition to this, there are all sorts of intangible benefits to having a homemaker, as it leads to a stronger nuclear family (not that it&#39;s impossible without, but it helps).</p>

<hr/>

<p>Intentional or not, this movement has drastically increased the revenue for income-taxing governments.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>many cases if one parent is not making some decent coin I find that it is usually a wash after all the extra expenses are taken into account.</p>

<p>Close friends were both working and had 2 kids.  After finally doing a budget they were only bringing in $150 extra a month with her working full time after all the extra expenses like Daycare, insurance, Gas, etc were taken into account.  </p>

<p>$150 less a month and she quit.  Both kids since then have seen huge improvements in School.  Their Behaviour improved as well.  The whole family has less stress and overall would agree they are happier now.  </p>

<p>The benefits of a Homemaker being part of the family is grossly under rated IMO.  I am looking forward to being a Stay at Home Dad for a few years very soon.</p>

<p>It worked for generations...if a system is not broke, why fix it?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes.  Of course having dual income households doubles the effective employment rate per household.</p>

<p>When it comes to income and households, the scenario is typically somewhere in the $120k + 50k range ($170k tax bracket) per household, with the idea being that through income deferment vehicles under the tax code, the higher earning spouse would transfer some income to the lower earning spouse in order to get to a lower bracket than their combined gross incomes would report. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Does a &quot;non-working&quot; spouse count as a lower earning spouse that income could be transferred to? Seems like I understand your point which is that the tax code encourages both spouses working, but it&#39;s still more money to the tax collectors..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>maybe I don&#39;t get the math. Mom makes $100k/yr.  Dad sets up LLC to be nanny to his own kids.  Mom hires DadLLC to nanny the kids, DadLLC gets to write off a bunch of expenses that non-LLC-Dads would have to pay taxes on.  Pay DadLLC just enough to cover costs, which are all written off by DadLLC.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean, there’s a lot at play there. Part of it could be the deep state’s deconstruction of a family unit and hereditary bonds that create values - making it easier to condition and indoctrinate people for statist means - and placing abject materialism as more valuable than a family as a normalcy. The recklessness of the govt and the endless printing of money by the fed is a vicious cycle meant to keep people in their place. </p>

<p>TL;DR</p>

<p>It’s like a hamster in a wheel, and with two hamsters in one wheel, it gives the illusion of going somewhere, but it’s actually not anymore beneficial or effective and often causes conflict between the two hamsters at some point. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Instead of kids beginning their institutionalization at 5 years, they&#39;re literally starting at 5 weeks. Moms often have to go straight back to work postpartum. Daycare workers do their best but let&#39;s be real: They&#39;re mostly kids straight out of high school making close to minimum wage. They&#39;re not going to care for your child as good as you would.  </p>

<p>Or for parents who want to avoid daycare, you could work alternate shifts with your partner. But then how often do the parents see each other? The kid just hangs out with one family member at a time instead of with everyone. It&#39;s sad. </p>

<p>Either way housework and cooking become outsourced. And rightly so, because both parents work so much already, but it&#39;s expensive. </p>

<p>Either way parents are more likely to hand their toddler a tablet or phone, just to get a break, have a conversation with their spouse, get dinner prepared... then the kid sits there watching weird Elsagate crap.</p>

<p>Like you said, it really feels like a hamster wheel. Stay at home spouses and a calm family life are luxuries only for the rich these days. </p>

It was nothing to rave about before that, either. </p>

<p>The North American experience of actually having a viable and even vibrant middle-class making up the majority and the kind of stability and progress that was possible due to it comes strictly from that period that peaked in the late 70&#39;s, started to slide in the 80&#39;s, and has been going steadily downhill ever since. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The push for wominz in the workplace was/is just an excuse to take tax revenue from both males and females, while also slashing the average wage in half.</p>

<p>We&#39;re seeing it now with the &#39;gender pay gap&#39;. In reality, the jobs women/men are doing are usually different, but the women on the lower skilled jobs want paying the same as the men doing higher skilled jobs. What happens? The mens wage will DROP to be the same as a womans.</p>

<p>&#39;Women&#39; complained about being homemakers and didn&#39;t want to stay at home all day (so the bullshit arguement goes) but there was never the chance for the man and woman to swap roles. Nope, now both sexes can work.</p>

<p>My Dad raised a house with three kids and a wife on his one wage. Me and my GF now earn double what my Dad did and while we don&#39;t live uncomfortably, there&#39;s no way we could support three kids.</p>

<p>I would be a home maker all day long. Easiest job ever.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it depends on the age of the kids.</p>

<p>When the kids are infants-to-toddlers, being a stay-at-home parent is basically the shittiest job on earth. You don&#39;t get a break, you&#39;re stuck in a house with a loud, incontinent lunatic with a death wish who needs constant supervision, and you generally don&#39;t have anyone to talk to, either.</p>

<p>Once they&#39;re in school, though, that workload dramatically decreases, and you end up with the stereotypical bored PTA mom.</p>

<hr/>

<p>One other thing is that being a parent is a skill, like any other. Some people are really organized and make their lives pretty easy. Others manage to fuck everything up all the time and spend their lives in crisis mode.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s also responsible for pushing up the price of housing, cars, etc. 50 years ago, homes were priced based on single incomes. The first man to send his wife to work saw a real benefit, because he spend his wife&#39;s income on a bigger house. Even if she didn&#39;t earn much money, if they could throw an extra 10 - 20% at a house they could outcompete the single income families. But as prices increased it became more and more necessary for families to go dual-income.</p>

<p>Now that prices are too high for even most dual-income families, the solution is to adopt polygamy so that families can go triple-income.</p>

<p>No, it would go up.  You would lose about 40% of total labor productivity and firms would have to significantly increase wages to meet labor needs and raise prices to compensate.  Those that couldn&#39;t would have to cut production, reducing the supply of goods and services, adding demand pressure to the price of goods and services available.</p>

<p>You would wind up with less production, more scarcity and higher prices.</p>

<p>Eventually you might return to some equilibrium of &quot;affordable&quot; prices, but it would come at the cost of drastically reduced product diversity and lower quality. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Heres my questions:</p>

<p>When we increase the productivity by 40%, do we necessarily then see a corresponding reduction in the prices of goods? Does our culture necessarily adapt to create values that mmediately implore us to consume that extra capacity?</p>

<p>Does the monopolistic tendencies of our insane intellectual property laws allow the free market to properly check the desire of the producers to keep the prices of goods higher than the prices should be given the added labor? As an example, if programmers etc all of a sudden saw a massive increase in supply, would Microsoft use their newfound labor savings to lower the price for Windows/Office? Why would they? They have a practical monopoly on the market: Apple focuses on hardware (so not directly competing with Microsoft) and Linux doesn&#39;t have the OEM arrangements that Microsoft does nor the market share to attract these new programmers with the prospect of a living wage.</p>

<p>If we combine the added labor capacity of the workforce with the odious state of intellectual property laws and monopoly, I&#39;m not sure its just &quot;we gain X labor capacity, reduce the price of goods by a corresponding X, and thus lower prices by a corresponding X.&quot;</p>

<p>In the process of our labor gains, the IP holders and monopolists are going to work towards using the new paradigm to grow their profits. I fear that much of the labor savings and added productive capacity has been converted to corporate and financial system profits... instead of benefiting both labor and the owners of labor. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not an economist and this is hard stuff, so it is an actual question. While there are many other factors (especially in the financial sector), the trend of corporate wealth/power gain relative to the masses supports this worry. Wealth inequality rises as gains in productivity are dominated by those using intellectual property laws, automation, and monopoly as tools to increase profits. The centralization of power thus increases and a belligerence of power sets in; as power becomes more belligerent, it becomes increasingly more and more hostile to labor and even its consumers (in a veiled way). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have done it as a stay at home dad, toughest job I have ever had, damn near broke me, women do NOT like having men in their world! Very lonely for me even though I was at lots of toddler groups etc.
It worked out salary wise it would only cost us 5k loss on our dual income as opposed paying for child care but what happened was we still tried to have the holidays and lifestyle we had, hard to change I guess so ended up costing more like 20k, over 3 years, but once I went back to work we paid that off in 3 years.
It’s a tough choice but my boy is so confident and out going I think I made the right choice. I have another one now but can’t do full time again, not because of the money but because of the mental scars from last time, just doing 2 days a week because I think he will still benefit from having his dad around. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would not dispute that at all! Personally, in my envisioned family unit we would offer unschooling or homeschooling so that&#39;s even more work on the homemaker (although I would of course help as possible). In fact, I feel the value derived from having a homemaker is often greater than the net result of the second spouse earning a salary. For example, a homemaker can keep a close on nutrition for the family as she is meal planning, whereas the family with two salaries is eating out more and eating more overprocessed foods. (That said, it&#39;s not impossible to do both earn a salary and effectively meal plan and cook. I know one example. But it&#39;s exhausting for the parent.)</p>

<p>In school I was &quot;brainwashed&quot; to believe that I could choose any career I want, and that I should appreciate that freedom, since it took hundreds of years to achieve.</p>

<p>At home I was expected to go to college and have a good career. My mom was a homemaker for 30 years and found it unfulfilling, especially after divorce and when we all left for college.</p>

<p>After college I&#39;m expected to work in the field I studied and pay off my student loans. If I want babies, I also have to consider health insurance.</p>

<p>And finally, I&#39;m not convinced men want a homemaker. It&#39;s a lot more pressure being the sole breadwinner, and the fear of endless alimony if things don&#39;t work out.</p>

Because my one child is young and mom and I were separated, I was paying too much in childcare to afford to work that position any longer.

    <div class="md"><p><strong>I&#39;m going to put my point up here, because even I don&#39;t like reading something this long. Man v Woman, American v immigrant doesn&#39;t matter. Whether women leave the workforce today, whether we build the wall tomorrow, whether we export all the criminals back to their country to deal with or not, we all lose. We need to finally turn our anger to where it belongs. The rich are making $300/hr (or more) to your and my $1/hr when it used to be $50/hr. That&#39;s the dividing line. And they keep it there by telling us Someone Else is causing it.</strong></p>

<p>Well the first three are expectations of men too. Especially from the poor/rich end of the scale. Go to school (either because you legally have to, your parents need you to so they can both work, or they paid a lot of money for you to.) Choose your field (largely motivated by your dad because he has connections at his construction job to barely make ends meet or you can be the VP at his organization to eventually take it over), and work hard after you get your degree (whether you like it or not, since you chose it even if you didn&#39;t want to) to be able to provide for the stay-at-home mom you&#39;re going to get pregnant way too early. (Either because you&#39;re going to make more money than you need or you have to hope one of them can support you when you retire because you can&#39;t afford to support yourself anymore.)</p>

<p>Number four was caused by women entering the workforce. When men thought they needed to marry and have a family with one girl, they generally did that. And both parties fought for it through the thick and thin because they both benefited. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/06/23/144-years-of-marriage-and-divorce-in-the-united-states-in-one-chart/?utm_term=.1e20c29f7819">Source: Marriage rates and divorces skyrocketed after WW2 when women entered the workforce en masse and since then both have been declining equally</a> They also earned significantly more in comparison to their management/executive teams than they have since then, because there&#39;s always someone willing to work for less. </p>

<p>Now that women have the same (general) purchasing power as a man that&#39;s gone. Other than the uber rich or uber poor, women can afford to have the same one night stands as men do. In return, young men and women are looking to satisfy their base desires rather than long term family goals because there is no negative to either. </p>

<p>There&#39;s a reason most rich men are married to traditionally beautiful women, in the young and prime of their lives, while the men work and the women stay at home. There&#39;s also a reason the poorest men have 5-6 kids with a woman you don&#39;t think could attract a mate and struggle every day to make ends meet with Kraft and Rice-A-Roni. </p>

<p>Whether men vs women or immigrant vs citizen, this isn&#39;t the argument that needs to be had. There is a benefit to multiculturalism, but it has a point, and there is a benefit to having a homemaker be it a woman or a man, to the same point. Ultimately, those in power have turned both of these stances on their ass in search of more power and more profits. The rich and poor stay where they are year after year, while the middle class edges in on the poor because they can&#39;t go the other way. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel you may have read a little too deep into this as a &#39;conspiracy&#39;.</p>

<p>Women in the workforce started during WW1 &amp; WW2. After women were able to work, it would have been difficult to close the right for them to work. </p>

<p>Furthermore, the concept of a mother at home spending a heap of time with her children is a 20th century invention. A little over a hundred years ago, women were performing very laborious domestic tasks. Washing clothes by hand, animal husbandry, sourcing clean water and food for the day, baking the bread, etc was all very time consuming. Kids were helping from a young age, doing what would be considered labour in this era.</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t read any studies on it, but I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if women (and men) spend more time with their children now than at any other period in recorded history.</p>

<p>Sure, there&#39;s more people in the workforce to tax, but I don&#39;t feel the link is as strong as you suggest for double income family units.</p>

<p>IMHO the problem isn&#39;t women working lowering wages, it&#39;s wage depression making the cost of working (daycare, added service consumption like meals, cleaning, etc) little more than break-even during the early years of the child&#39;s life.</p>

<p>I know plenty of people who said their spouse kept working even though with daycare it was a marginal break-even proposition financially.  They didn&#39;t want to lose job experience or have to re-enter the workforce after their kids went to school.  We knew some spouses who did quit their jobs and most of them found it really difficult to gain equivalent employment when they went back to work.</p>

<p>Only according the government&#39;s metrics. Homemakers do TONS of work that isn&#39;t captured by official GDP or other metrics. Eating out, daycare, cleaning service, etc, are all captured (and taxed) when the second spouse is working. But the homemaker doing laundry, cleaning the house, cutting hair, cooking dinner, and watching the kids is not taxed or counted towards GDP.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, to real world metrics.  You&#39;re assuming that a woman working in the labor force is earning the same amount of money as it costs to provide &quot;homemaking&quot; services.  Many women in the work force earn a multiple of that amount, which is why they can afford to work and send their kids to childcare, hire a cleaning person, etc.</p>

<p>The comparison to look at is not the cost to provide homemaking services but value of having a homemaker, which is intangible but IMO significantly higher than the cost of simply buying those services. And that needs to be compared to not the potential salary of the homemaker but the net after tax, which is somewhere between 60 and 80% of the gross salary.</p>

<p>Every situation is unique and for a lot of couples it makes sense to both work. For many couples it makes sense for the woman to work and the man to make the home.</p>

<p>You&#39;re right it&#39;s not a zero sum swap, but it does trend to more income for the government to tax which is what I am trying to highlight.</p>

<p>Yes, but your intangible value isn&#39;t taxable under any situation.  Plus I think the reality is that utility value of a homemaker was declining substantially as the actual work performed by homemaker shrank with the rise of consumer goods.   By the late 1950s, a homemaker didn&#39;t need to wash dishes, maintain a fire, make clothes, butcher meat, or many other tasks.  In fact, they sat at home so much with so little to do that we ended up with the phenomenon of &quot;mother&#39;s little helper&quot; or Valium to deal with the anxiety of so many women doing so little.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Yes, but from an economic perspective it&#39;s an empty statement.  <em>Any</em> economic growth benefits the government&#39;s taxation goals, so simply wanting more taxation isn&#39;t a sufficient explanation for government involvement in women working.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In fairness, this is a much worse situation in the US than anywhere else.</p>

<p>Back in the old country, you have about 9 months paid maternity leave, with the option of taking longer unpaid, men have just gotten 2 Weeks paid paternity leave too. Some countries are more generous.</p>

<p>Child care is expensive here though, other countries can be less so or tax credits can be provided to subsidize the expense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My GF talks about wanting to be a SAHM, but I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be able to afford to pay for her student loans, a mortgage, and the kid(s) we might one day have.</p>

<p>I think she&#39;s going to have to keep working, as the government will never forgive the stranglehold they hold over so many millennial/Gen-Xers futures.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah.  She came from a very poor background, so it&#39;s been her only way out.  If she goes through with PA/Vet school she will have between 100-150K in student loans on a conservative estimate.</p>

<p>She was at 58K on just her Bachelor&#39;s as she lived on that while going to school and working part time.</p>

<p>She makes 18K a year and doesn&#39;t qualify for any kind of assistance.  Shit&#39;s crazy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, stay at home spouses and a calm family life are luxuries for <em>upper income</em> people. Maybe not <em>rich</em>.</p>

<p>It&#39;s just that back in the day, a teacher could be one middle class income. A firefighter could be one middle class income. Now you have to do better than that if you want the decent house and family. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My wife and I  are middle class and having an Au Pair was actually cheaper than day care. It was a wonderful experience that we did for two years. Both Au Pair really became part of the family.</p>
