<p>Does anyone remember how many members there are in the National Education Association, the NEA which represents teachers?</p>

<p>Oh wait, it&#39;s just here,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The National Education Association (NEA) is the largest professional interest group in the United States.[2]</p>

<p>At the national level, the NEA lobbies the United States Congress and federal agencies and is active in the nominating process for Democratic candidates.[11] From 1989 through the 2014 election cycle, the NEA spent over $92 million on political campaign contributions, 97% of which went to Democrats.[12]</p>

<p>aka astoturfing, aka some particular interests get promoted to top subreddit slots. </p>

<p>To the top of videos as you so observantly mentioned, to the front page of r/all, and oh it surfaced here as well with 10k upvotes,  followed by a thread with +267. </p>

<p>Totally organic. America&#39;s teachers are up in the middle of the night upvoting reddit threads to the tune 10,000 on r/conspiracy just because.</p>

<p>If it gets a couple thousand here at #1 and then hits r/all that discrepancy is accounted for. There&#39;s a difference on post rankings and how much exposure the #1 slot gets.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ironically I&#39;ve been downvoted for asking about instances of vote manipulation. Anyway, look. I&#39;m starting to believe this. I was researching this crypto b.s. ponzi scheme called cryptohuge and instead came across this subreddit called ParagonCoin. So there was a post calling it a scam and that their comments were being deleted whenever they questioned the company. Then one guy comments about how their subreddit seems to be flooded with bots made from old abandoned reddit accounts. So I head over to their subreddit and click on a few redditors who post there frequently and, in my opinion, all of their comments seem very short and &quot;bot-like&quot;. Most of the comments aren&#39;t personal or more than 5 words. I might be wrong, but head on over to that subreddit and check for yourself. If this bot b.s. is true, then they could be responsible for vote manipulation and we could be persuaded into seeing posts that are advertised. Maybe I have my tin foil hat on too tight but, have you noticed how some high upvoted posts of pictures are kind of subtle advertisements anyway? Disney, Goodwill, this FCC thing, star wars, Nike, Apple... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Teachers not getting a raise isn&#39;t a fucking conspiracy, either. That&#39;s what gets me about this shit. It&#39;s just thinly veiled <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> shitposting. Is it shitty that teachers didn&#39;t get a raise? Sure. But conspiracy? No, not at all. You can turn literally any leftist political issue into a conspiracy using the same logic people use to justify getting stories like the teacher shit to the front page. For example: I could argue that the &quot;gender pay gap&quot; is a conspiracy using the <em>exact same logic used to justify the teacher article</em> and plaster it all over the front page.</p>

<p>Pretty much <strong>any</strong> political issue the modern left cares about can be framed as a conspiracy. That is exactly what you are seeing go on in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. This is because, frankly, Marxism, Cultural Marxism and associated narratives on economics are themselves essentially conspiracy theories which presuppose wage inequality (among other things) are the result of what amounts to a conspiracy on the part of the rich.</p>

<p>The logical contortions that allow leftists to paint every single issue in terms of victim/oppressor <em>are very similar to how conspiracy theorists think of conspiracies.</em> &quot;White men are the root of all of society&#39;s problems&quot; is not really that different from &quot;globalist bankers are suppressing the middle class.&quot; That <strong>doesn&#39;t mean it belongs on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.</strong> At least, not in my opinion.</p>

<p>But apparently the mods disagree.</p>

<p>You can use the same logical games people use to justify the teacher article to justify <em>literally any</em> political issue on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. It&#39;s a huge problem here and I think the mods need to address it. </p>

<p>For example, if I as a right winger wanted to get one of my pet issues to the front page, it would be trivially easy to reframe the issue as a conspiracy. For example: &quot;Illegal immigration is a conspiracy to disenfranchise Republican voters,&quot; &quot;High taxes are a conspiracy to rob the middle class of its wealth and redistribute it to Democrat voters,&quot; &quot;Global warming is a conspiracy designed to allow the government greater authority over corporations.&quot;</p>

<p>ANYTHING can be a conspiracy when you frame it in certain terms. I think some clarification is needed from the mod team on what is a conspiracy, and more importantly, what isn&#39;t.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The NEA is a dark and shady beast. I spend a lot of time on opensecrets, anyone can confirm this from my history. Here are some facts I looked at on opensecrets.</p>

<p>NEA is the largest teachers union in the US</p>

<p><a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/orgs/summary.php?id=d000000064">https://www.opensecrets.org/orgs/summary.php?id=d000000064</a></p>

<p>Of the 28 million they spent last year, 24 million was &quot;soft money&quot;, or &quot;party-building&quot; money that is <em>completely unregulated</em>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/orgs/totals.php?id=D000000064&amp;amp;cycle=2016">https://www.opensecrets.org/orgs/totals.php?id=D000000064&amp;amp;cycle=2016</a></p>

<p>The NEA gave the bulk of its spending, 16 million, to it&#39;s super PAC, NEA advocacy fund. So let&#39;s check that out.</p>

<p>First thing you notice is that they spent 0 dollars on federal candidates. Soft money, unregulated, easy to obfuscate.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/pacs/expenditures.php?cycle=2016&amp;amp;cmte=C00489815">https://www.opensecrets.org/pacs/expenditures.php?cycle=2016&amp;amp;cmte=C00489815</a></p>

<p>So what did they spend that 16 million on? Well, top of their recipients list is &quot;Waterfront Strategies&quot;, at 3.36 million.</p>

<p>What is that?</p>

<p><a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/expends/vendor.php?vendor=Waterfront%20Strategies">https://www.opensecrets.org/expends/vendor.php?vendor=Waterfront%20Strategies</a></p>

<p>You tell me. They reported $188.8 million in 2016 from various Democrat-related PACs (all soft money, all unregulated by FEC)</p>

<p>So what is Waterfront Strategies and what does it do? People dont really know, other than that it&#39;s a secretive branch of <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2014/08/14/the-companies-making-the-most-off-the-2014-campaign-season/?utm_term=.cde1c547ce46">GMMB</a>, which is an ad agency slash political consulting firm, and does &quot;media buys&quot;.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.publicintegrity.org/2013/01/18/12054/expenditure-profile-waterfront-strategies">https://www.publicintegrity.org/2013/01/18/12054/expenditure-profile-waterfront-strategies</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Waterfront Strategies is a media buying firm that serves primarily Democratic-aligned super PACs and nonprofits.  The firm was the preferred vendor for Majority PAC and House Majority PAC — the super PACs aimed at securing Democratic seats in the U.S. Senate and U.S. House of Representatives.</p>

<p>Waterfront billed more than $81 million for political ad buys for Citizens United-related groups in the 2012 election, yet very little information about the firm is publicly available.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Worth noting that while they took in $92 million in 2012, they took $188.8 mil inbuys.</p>

<p>Another look into the &quot;shape-shifting dark money&quot; of this &quot;mysterious firm&quot; here:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2013/05/shape-shifting-by-liberal-dark-mone/">https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2013/05/shape-shifting-by-liberal-dark-mone/</a></p>

<p><a href="https://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/1579661">https://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/1579661</a></p>

<p>Tl;dr </p>

<p>The NEA&#39;s PAC gave the bulk of its 2016 individual expenditures to a shadowy media firm that appears to operate like Cambridge Analytica; doing sketchy targeted advertising, is part of a marketing firm which does data collection, and hides it&#39;s activities as well as it&#39;s sources of funding.</p>
