<p>The ENTIRE SYSTEM of FISA-702 surveillance and data collection was weaponized against a political campaign. The DOJ and FBI used the FISA Court to gain access to Trump data, and simultaneously justify earlier FISA “queries” by their contractor, Fusion GPS. FISA-702 queries were used to gather information on the Trump campaign which later became FBI counterintelligence surveillance on the officials therein.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There’s not.  The full story is not out, much of what is listed is conjecture and drawing conclusions that don’t exist.  </p>

<p>No one in their right mind would press charges, as proven by the no charges being brought by Republicans.  Republicans were pushing for charges against Steele, based on what they heard in testimony.  All that went down the drain when the full transcript was released. </p>

<p>So you&#39;re saying that the Feinstein leak caused the DoJ to not press charges? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, I’m saying Republicans that were on the committee were hinting at charges against Steele based on what they heard in testimony.  By not releasing the transcript of that testimony they could “fill in the blanks” as needed to get what they wanted.  By releasing the testimony in full the public can see the testimony and suddenly the talk of charges by Republicans falls away.  They no longer have secrecy to push their agenda</p>
