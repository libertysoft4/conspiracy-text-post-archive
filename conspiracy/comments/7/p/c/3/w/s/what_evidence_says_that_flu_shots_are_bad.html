<p>When your best bet is to flip a coin, I prefer betting on your natural immune system.</p>

<p>Unless you have reason to believe your immune system is compromised (i.e. those actually <em>at risk</em> of dying from influenza), it seems the better choice to not to inject an untested cocktail of heavy metals and virus proteins into your bloodstream.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the link. So average effective rate is about say 40%. That means that out of 20 people, say normally 10 of them would get the flu without shots, then with shots , only 6 of them would get the flu, so it still helps 4 people. So there does seem to be some benefit out of it. Basically you reduce your chances of getting the flu by about 40%.</p>

There&#39;s no evidence showing that injecting damaged/dead virus or bacteria directly into the bloodstream produces any level of immunity to the wild version. Vaccines produce an immune response because of the foreign material introduced. They&#39;ve become a very handy weapon to keep a population sick, wounded or dead.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I really hope this isn’t the logic you go by haha. I should start off by saying vaccines, in the purest sense, do work. I don’t know how old you are and don’t care to know, but the time period you received vaccinations (including flu shots) is an important factor. Because you got vaccines when you were a kid and a flu shot every year is flawed logic at best. Yes, there are people who believe the sole cause of autism is due to vaccines and/or the adjuvants contained within. However, there are far more factors at play making it much harder to say vaccines are safe. Factors include the vaccine itself, the particular adjuvants administered in a single ‘session’ and/or overtime, the time of life at which the vaccines entered the body, diet-related factors etc.. Unfortunately, it is not as easy as saying parts of the vaccinated population (or in your case, a sample size of 1) don’t have autism, therefore they aren’t bad. Bottom line, no reasonable person (or scientist/doctor) can conclude vaccines do not contribute to autism. In fact, if you believe in science, you would only be led to conclude the opposite.</p>

<p>Here is a reason why you should reconsider your position. Hep B is generally administered immediately after birth regardless of circumstance/test results - consider you and your partner have been throughly screened for Hep B, haven’t used dirty needles and aren’t sleeping with the entire town - there is no medically necessary reason to administer the vaccine so soon in life. Yes, there are higher risk demographics but families are entitled to informed consent but unfortunately, “informed” often is not a factor in the decision. This should make anyone at least think about this issue deeply.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I should reconsider because I got vaccinated against something that I could possibly get in the future and didn’t give consent?</p>

<p>It in no way harmed me. And now I can freely go about not worrying. </p>

<p>Because a single doctor says a vaccine causes harm that wasn’t previously know does not make that one doctor a genius. Sometimes adverse reactions happens other times it’s an issue the patient already has but hasn’t shown and then is linked to them getting a vaccine. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can’t unchange what’s already done but this is quite a myopic perspective. Because a single doctor says a vaccine is safe bc he wasn’t aware of the potential consequences doesn’t make that one doctor a genius. See, I can do that too but it’s not productive. My point is not suggesting vaccines aren’t important, it’s the fact that well educated medical professionals and scientists ignore blatant evidence of risks that often aren’t conveyed to the patient, data is manipulated (money is a great motive) and generally refuse to accept that the CDC guidelines are significantly flawed. Yes, underlying circumstances could be to blame - another variable for deeply considering the variables at play beyond the vaccine itself. The governing bodies aren’t even consistent and often contradict one another. Do you know anyone who has gotten a tetanus shot recently? I bet you don’t because it is hardly ever administered on its own any longer in the US. In fact, I don’t think it’s even an option anymore. Most doctors will not disclose this - try it. It’s an easy way to see if have a gem of a doctor or not. </p>

<p>They never gave them out when I was a kid, I came down with the mumps-chicken pox-german measles, but still had my fair share of shots growing up. In the late 60&#39;s got my smallpox scratch several times, it never took, that was my mothers lunatic moment!</p>
