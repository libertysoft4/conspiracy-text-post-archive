<p>The skeptics are generally not very popular on this sub.</p>

<p>There are two kinds of skeptics. The first are those who act like a stick in the mud, and demand that <em>the whole damned world</em> come to them, and demonstrate to them (the skeptic) why they should even believe in the first place. They won&#39;t give an inch.</p>

<p>These skeptics <em>shouldn&#39;t</em> be popular. Most of them are trolls, many are are straight-up jerks. And the core reason is because they act <em>entitled</em> to the understandings that those in this world have worked hard to achieve</p>

<p>Then there&#39;s the other kind of skeptic, the kind who doesn&#39;t necessarily believe, but wants to understand. They&#39;re not convinced, but they&#39;re generally curious. Genuinely curious. They&#39;re willing to set aside their preconceived notions, put in a little (or a lot) of work on their end, and/or commit to the supreme intellectual feat: holding two contradictory ideas in their head at the same time.</p>

<p>Those skeptics are and should be welcomed in any community pursuing alternate perspectives on anything. Unfortunately, there are few of them.</p>

<p>Clearly you haven’t been red-pilled in any sense on anything. It’s a painful, difficult, saddening, effortful experience. People on this board have been through that. No one can put you through it but you. And until you go through it, no one can reach you. </p>

<p>But you want others to cross that chasm to you. You <em>demand</em> it. And you act entitled to it. No one with any perspective on anything owes you a thing. Even if you ask for it. Even if you demand it. And nonetheless, it doesn’t work that way. </p>

<p>When you really want to understand, you will. And no one will do it for you but you. </p>
